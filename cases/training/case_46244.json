Represented by private counsel and the non-profit \"Student Borrower Protection Center\", AFT sought an injunction compelling the Department to reinstate IDR plans and fulfill its statutory obligations. The lawsuit claimed that the Department&rsquo;s actions violate the Higher Education Act, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the contractual rights of borrowers.&nbsp; The case was assigned to Judge Reggie B.

AFT&rsquo;s complaint alleged that this move was driven by political motives rather than legal necessity. It argued that the Department&rsquo;s failure to process repayment applications violates borrowers&rsquo; statutory and contractual rights and constitutes an unlawful withholding of agency action under the APA.</p>\r\n<p>AFT filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on March 24, 2025, seeking to enjoin the defendants from continuing to shut down income-driven repayment plans for student loan borrowers.</p>\r\n<p>The following day, the defendants reopened the online application process for IDR plans and loan consolidation.

The parties submitted the report on April 25, proposing an order that the court adopted on April 28. The order required the defendants to file at least three status reports at 30-day intervals, describing the number of pending and decided IDR repayment and PSLF applications during the 30 days. Unless further ordered by the court, the defendants are only required to file six such status reports.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 9, 2025, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint which converted the case into a class-action lawsuit against the Department, with 5 distinct classes, which distinguished among three statutory repayment programs (Income-Driven Repayment (IDR), Income Based Repayment (IBR) and Income Contingent Repayment (ICR)). All three programs were created under the Higher Education Act.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The amended complaint also requested an injunction that barred the Department from charging interest on SAVE Plan loans until the litigation is resolved.

The U.S. government, through the U.S. Department of Education (ED or the \nDepartment), is the country’s largest creditor of student loans. Today, there are nearly 43 million \nfederal student loan borrowers, with approximately $1.62 trillion outstanding in debt.  \n2.  Congress designed this federal student loan program to expand access to higher \neducation and increase economic mobility regardless of one’s financial station. To that end, when \ndesigning and modifying the federal student loan system, Congress provided clear and specific \ndirectives to the Department so that millions of Americans could repay their loans without being \nhindered by the debt. Specifically, Congress directed ED to offer income-driven repayment (IDR) \nplans that tie a borrower’s monthly payment to their income. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 2 of 19\n \n3.  Notwithstanding this clear Congressional command, the Department has chosen to \nshut down access to all income-driven repayment plans. Nor has the Department indicated when \nit will–if ever–resurrect the programs. The result: borrowers are unable to access affordable \nmonthly payment plans, some borrowers are being thrust into default on their debt, and some \npublic service workers are being denied their statutory right to lower their monthly payment and \nearn credit towards Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF).  \n4.  This is not occurring in a vacuum for student loan borrowers. It comes in the context \nof the President repeatedly announcing his plans to close the Department of Education, which was \ncreated by an Act of Congress. And, it is on the heels of the recent equally-unlawful actions to gut \ncritical student loan protections from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This shutdown, \nwhich creates significant confusion for borrowers, therefore comes at a time when the official \ngovernment offices meant to assist borrowers with their loans are being shuttered. \n5.  The burden of this misconduct is already being felt by Plaintiff, the American \nFederation of Teachers (AFT), and its 1.8 million members. A significant number of AFT’s \nmembership has student debt, is working in public service, and has sought or will try to seek access \nto an IDR plan. Dr. Picolya Robinson incurred student loan debt to pursue her lifelong dream of \nbecoming a psychologist and working in public service. As a single mother of two, the weight of \nthis debt has brought considerable financial strain and emotional stress, overshadowing her \nprofessional achievements and impacting her personal life. Dr. Robinson was enrolled in an \naffordable payment plan and on track to qualify for PSLF until her repayment plan was abruptly \nenjoined by the 8th Circuit. Dr. Robinson needs to enroll in a different plan in order to ensure that \nthese months of employment count towards PSLF but can no longer do so as a result of the \nDepartment’s decision to shut down all of the IDR plans. And, for its part, AFT’s resources have \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 3 of 19\n \nbeen and will continue to be diverted to address the confusion caused by the Department’s decision \nto leave millions of borrowers in this IDR limbo.  \n6.  At bottom, these borrowers simply want to pay back their student loans according \nto the terms that Congress, and their contracts, provide. Therefore, AFT, on its own behalf and on \nbehalf of its members, brings this lawsuit to compel the Department to abide by Congress’s \ncommand and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the affordable, \nincome-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled.    \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n7.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 \nU.S.C. §§ 701-706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. \n8.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Plaintiff’s \nheadquarters is in D.C., because Defendants reside in D.C. and because a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to these claims occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff AFT is a membership organization representing 1.8 million pre-K through \n12th-grade  teachers,  early  childhood  educators,  paraprofessionals,  and  other  school-related \npersonnel; higher education faculty and professional staff; federal, state, and local government \nemployees; and nurses and other healthcare professionals.  \n10.  AFT’s headquarters is in Washington, D.C. Its 1.8 million members belong to more \nthan 3000 locals across all fifty U.S. states.  \n11.  AFT’s mission is to promote fairness, democracy, economic opportunity, and high-\nquality  public  education,  healthcare,  and  public  services  for  students,  their  families  and \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 4 of 19\n \ncommunities. It meets this mission by ensuring its members receive fair pay and benefits for their \ncritical work, and by fighting for safe working conditions that also benefit students, patients, and \nall those who use public services. Helping children and students, and ensuring the economic \nsecurity and dignity of AFT’s members and their families, is at the core of this mission. \n12.  As part of this work, AFT takes a leading role in fighting for the financial stability \nof public service, education, and health care workers, particularly when it comes to the increasingly \ncrippling costs of education. \n13.  Many of AFT’s members have student loan debt and 75% of AFT’s members work \nin roles that require a higher education degree and are eligible for PSLF. \n14.  Thousands of AFT’s members have previous access and/or are eligible for the \nIncome-Based Repayment Plan, the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn \nPlan, and the Revised Pay as You Earn Plan, each defined and described below. \n15.  However, according to a survey of AFT members who struggle financially, 8 in 10 \nsay student debt is a “major burden,” and it is a major driver of financial difficulties as compared \nto any other debt.1 The result: 78% of these members report that they or someone in their household \nhas previously fallen behind on making debt payments, and one in three have had their debts go \ninto default. \n16.  AFT is required by its mission to provide its members with assistance and accurate \ninformation on student loan repayment and PSLF—which is made all the more difficult by the \nDepartment’s misconduct, as well as the Trump Administration’s firing of the Consumer Financial \nProtection  Bureau’s  Student  Loan  Ombudsman,  the  removal  of  the  complaint  function  on \n \n1 https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/media/2018/ppt_aft-member-debt_hart2018.pdf \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 5 of 19\n \nstudentaid.gov, and the firing of nearly all of the staff at federal student aid dedicated to resolving \nstudent loan borrower complaints. \n17.  Under the leadership of AFT President Randi Weingarten, AFT has spent, and \ncontinues to spend, tens of thousands dollars on debt clinics to educate members to better navigate \ntheir repayment options, and it has diverted more than two thousand hours of valuable staff time \nthat would otherwise have been spent focused on issues like collective bargaining; retirement \nsecurity; healthcare; student learning conditions; and educators’, public employees’ and health \ncare workers’ working conditions. Since the Department shut down access to IDR plans, AFT staff \nhave had to  redraft  clinic  curriculum  and have diverted significant  additional  staff time to \nanswering member questions. The AFT committed to expanding economic security programs for \nmembers and was developing a new financial literacy clinic curriculum to help members. The \nprogram development has been delayed due to the actions of the Department and the new demand \nfrom members with student debt. The AFT was preparing to end a multi-year contract with a tech \ncompany called Summer which provided direct services to members with student debt. Due to the \nuncertainty and lack of communication from the Department, the union has had to reallocate \nresources and extend the contract through June 2026.  \n18.  The relief sought in this complaint would inure to the benefit of thousands of AFT \nmembers who are actually injured by the Department’s violations of the statutes requiring that \nincome-driven repayment plans be available. \n19.  Defendant United States Department of Education is a federal agency with its \nprincipal  place  of  business  at  400  Maryland  Avenue  SW,  Washington,  D.C.  Defendant  is \nresponsible for administering federal student loan and grant programs in the United States. \n20.  Defendant Linda McMahon is the Secretary of Education (Secretary). Plaintiff sues \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 6 of 19\n \nSecretary McMahon in her official capacity. Secretary McMahon is charged with the supervision \nand management of all decisions and actions of the United States Department of Education, and \nso all allegations in this complaint against the Department of Education are made against her. \nBACKGROUND  \nIncome-Driven Repayment Plans \n21.  In 1965, Congress enacted the Higher Education Act (HEA) because “every citizen \nis entitled to an education to meet his or her full potential without financial barriers.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1221-1(2)  (emphasis  added).  In  other  words,  Congress  aimed  to  “increase  educational \nopportunities” and help students access the “benefits of postsecondary education.”  Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2362 (2023). \n22.  In 1994, Congress amended the HEA and created the William D. Ford Federal \nDirect Loan Program. This program increased the government’s ability to directly lend money to \nstudents. As a result, the student loan system shifted from one mostly involving private lenders to \none in which the U.S. government became the primary creditor of student loans.  \n23.  To  ensure  that  student  loans  bolstered—rather  than  hampered–economic \nopportunity, Congress provided the Secretary with a clear directive: offer students various loan \nrepayment options, including some that tether the borrower’s monthly payment to their income. \nSuch plans are known as income-driven repayment plans.  \n24.  Specifically, Congress enacted two statutory provisions requiring income-driven \nrepayment plans. \n25.  First, Congress requires the Secretary to offer “Income-Based Repayment” plans \n(“IBR”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1098e.  \n26.  The IBR statute provides an “income-based” affordable repayment plan for federal \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 7 of 19\n \nstudent loan borrowers for whom paying their full loans would be a financial hardship.  \n27.  Congress used mandatory language when setting out the Secretary’s requirement \nto offer an IBR plan, saying: the “Secretary shall carry out a program under which a borrower . . . \nwho has a partial financial hardship . . . may elect, during any period the borrower has the partial \nfinancial hardship, to have the borrower’s aggregate monthly payment for all such loans not \nexceed” a payment formula set by statute. 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b). \n28.  The Department has similarly acknowledged that it has a mandatory duty to offer \nIBR to borrowers. 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820, 43,837 (Department “do[es] not believe that sunsetting \nthe IBR plan is permitted by section 493C(b) of the HEA which authorized the IBR plan.”). \n29.  Second, Congress requires the Secretary to create and implement an “Income-\nContingent” repayment plan (“ICR”).  \n30.  The ICR statute has been around since 1994, while the IBR statute was enacted in \n2007.  Congress  created  this  second  program  to  respond  to  the  rising  costs  of  college,  a \ncorresponding increase in student loan debt, and the increasing number of borrowers defaulting.  \n31.  The ICR statute mandates that “The Secretary shall offer a borrower of a loan . . . \nan income contingent repayment plan, with varying annual repayment amounts based on the \nincome of the borrower.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D). \n32.  The Department has also acknowledged its mandatory obligation to offer ICR to \ndirect loan borrowers. See 90 Fed. Reg. 3695 (Jan. 15, 2025) (explaining that certain changes were \nbeing made to meet the “Department’s statutory obligation under the HEA to offer borrowers an \nincome-contingent repayment plan.”). \n33.  Over time, the Secretary has crafted four different options to effectuate these \nstatutory directives.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 8 of 19\n \n34.  Each payment plan has different characteristics that vary meaningfully with respect \nto the calculation of monthly payments, the length of the repayment term (and if/when the loans \nare forgiven after a certain amount of time in repayment), and the amount of discretionary income \nthat factors into the equation.  \n35.  Implementing the commands of the IBR statute, the Secretary created the Income-\nBased Repayment Plan. \n36.  And implementing the commands of the ICR statute, the Secretary created three \nplans: the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR Plan), the Pay As You Earn plan (PAYE \nPlan), and the Revised Pay As Your Earn plan (REPAYE Plan, later, as described below, renamed \nthe SAVE Plan).  \n37.  In  addition  to  its  statutory  and  regulatory  obligations,  ED  has  contractual \nobligations to ensure that borrowers can access these plans. \n38.  When a borrower first takes out a student loan, they sign a legally enforceable \npromissory note with the Department of Education.  \n39.  In addition to identifying the borrower’s obligations, the contract identifies the \nborrower’s rights under the contract.  \n40.  These rights include the ability to repay the loans under one of these different \nincome-driven repayment plans.  \n41.  Indeed, the contract includes an entire section on the different plans, and crystalizes \nthat “[u]nder an income-driven repayment plan, your required monthly payment amount is based \non your income and family size, instead of being based on your loan debt, interest rate, and \nrepayment period, as under a traditional repayment plan.”  \n42.  Although the four statutorily mandated IDR plans have not operated perfectly, they \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 9 of 19\n \nhave been a lifeline in preventing student loan borrowers from default. This saves borrowers from \nthe punitive impacts of such a default, including the potential seizure of tax refunds, wages, or \ngovernment benefits.   \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness \n43.  In addition to providing borrowers with access to IDR plans, Congress also requires \nthe Secretary to discharge a borrower’s student debt in certain circumstances. \n44.  Most notably, federal law provides loan cancellation for public service workers \nwho have worked for ten years in eligible public service jobs while making eligible payments on \ntheir loans. 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1).  \n45.  The PSLF statute states: that the Secretary of Education “shall cancel the balance \nof interest and principal due . . . on any eligible Federal Direct Loan” for a borrower who “has \nmade 120” eligible “monthly payments on the eligible Federal Direct Loan after October 1, 2007” \nand “has been employed in a public service job during the period in which the borrower ma[de] \neach of the 120 payments.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1). \n46.  To be eligible for PSLF, a borrower must be enrolled in a standard repayment plan \n(in which case the borrower pays the entire debt off over a period of ten years), or one of the \nincome-driven repayment plans.    \n47.  The Secretary has issued implementing regulations for the PSLF statute which \nfurther requires the Secretary to provide loan discharges to borrowers who have satisfied the \neligibility criteria. \n48.  Just as with IDR, the borrower’s initial master promissory note informs borrowers \nof their PSLF rights, telling borrowers that “Under this program, we will forgive the remaining \nbalance due on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 payments (after October 1, 2007) on \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 10 of 19\n \nthose loans under certain repayment plans while you are employed full-time by a qualifying \nemployer.”   \n49.  Again, while PSLF has not operated without issues, it has been key in allowing \nindividuals to serve their communities and the public without fear that their student loan debt will \ndrive them into poverty. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Prior Administration Issues a New IDR Rule, but States Sue to Block the Effort \n50.  On July 10, 2023, the Department of Education issued a final rule to improve its \nREPAYE plan.  \n51.  In the Rule, the Department renamed the “REPAYE Plan” the “SAVE Plan,” and \nmade changes so that it would be the best option for the bulk of student loan borrowers. See \nImproving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and \nthe Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820.  \n52.  In an effort to simplify borrowers’ options, the Rule also sunsetted enrollment in \nthe ICR and PAYE Plans.  \n53.  Certain provisions of the Rule were designated for early implementation and went \ninto effect in 2023. See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820; 88 Fed. Reg. 72,685. \n54.  As a result, millions of student loan borrowers, including thousands of public \nservice workers, enrolled in the SAVE Plan in 2023 and the first half of 2024.   \n55.  Though the SAVE Plan was designed to help millions of borrowers, in April 2024, \na group of states sued the Department to challenge the Rule in the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Missouri.  \n56.  The states’ lawsuit does not challenge the IBR statute or regulations, nor does the \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 11 of 19\n \nlawsuit challenge the PSLF statute or regulations. The lawsuit also does not challenge the legality \nof the ICR Plan or the PAYE Plan.  \n57.  On June 24, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri \npreliminarily enjoined the Department from providing loan forgiveness under the SAVE Rule.  \n58.  On  July  18,  2024,  the  Eighth  Circuit  Court  of  Appeals  granted  the  states’ \nemergency motion for an administrative stay prohibiting the Department from implementing the \nnew Rule, and on August 9, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals enjoined portions of the \nSAVE Plan pending appeal.   \n59.  On February 18, 2025, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion. It \nagreed with the District Court and concluded that the forgiveness provisions of the SAVE Rule \nwere invalid. It found the provision un-severable from the rest of the Rule and therefore affirmed \nthe injunction.  \n60.  The Eighth Circuit also opined on the forgiveness provisions of the pre-2023 \nversion of the REPAYE rule. It said that the forgiveness provisions of the prior REPAYE rule \nwere likely invalid. It did not otherwise speak to the rest of the pre-2023 REPAYE plan, nor \npreclude ED from utilizing it in the future.  \n61.  The Eighth Circuit’s decisions do not impact the IBR statute, regulations, or ED’s \ncontractual obligations with respect to IBR.  \n62.  The Eighth Circuit’s decisions do not impact the PSLF statute, regulations, or ED’s \ncontractual obligations with respect to PSLF. \n63.  The Eighth Circuit also did not enjoin the Department from using the ICR plan or \nthe PAYE plan.  \nDuring the Litigation, the Prior Administration Provides Borrowers with Access to IDR to \nMeet its Statutory Obligation  \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 12 of 19\n \n64.  In the face of this litigation, the prior Administration took a number of steps in 2024 \nand January 2025 to adhere to the court order and offer borrowers the repayment plans mandated \nby statute, regulation, and contract.  \n65.  On July 19, 2024, the day after the Eighth Circuit granted an emergency stay, the \nDepartment placed all borrowers who had been making payments in the SAVE Plan into a \nforbearance (i.e., a status during which the Department delays the borrower’s obligation to make \nmonthly payments). The Department does not count months during this forbearance as months of \neligible payment for PSLF purposes. \n66.  From July to October 2024, the Department ensured borrowers could apply for IBR \nusing a paper or PDF application form.  \n67.  On  October  2,  2024,  the  Department  of  Education  re-opened  its  online  IBR \napplication. \n68.  The Department also recognized its obligation to offer a plan under the ICR statute, \nand that the Eighth Circuit did not preclude it from doing so. \n69.  On November 15, 2024, the Department of Education issued an Interim Final Rule \nto ensure that it was “in compliance with the statutory requirement to offer an income-contingent \nrepayment plan to borrowers.”  \n70.  Under this Rule, the Department reversed its sunsetting of the ICR and PAYE plans, \nallowing borrowers to enroll in ICR or PAYE until July 1, 2027.  \n71.  On January 15, 2025, the Department finalized its Rule allowing borrowers to \nenroll in ICR or PAYE until July 1, 2027. \n72.  As a result, as of 11:59 a.m. on January 20, 2025, ED offered borrowers enrollment \nin plans under both the IBR and ICR statutes.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 13 of 19\n \nThe Current Administration Halts Access to IDR Plans \n \n73.  Under the current legal landscape, the Department of Education can offer three IDR \nplans and still comply with the Eighth Circuit’s decisions: the IBR plan, the ICR plan, and the \nPAYE plan. It can also utilize the bulk of the prior REPAYE plan.  \n74.  Indeed, the Eighth Circuit specifically distinguished the IBR statute and IBR plan \nwhen discussing the purported problems with the Department’s new Rule. \n75.  Nonetheless,  the  Department  is  now  following  the  President’s  command.  On \nFebruary 26, 2025, the current Administration issued a Stop Work Order, directing all loan \nservicers to stop accepting and processing income-driven repayment applications. \n76.  The Stop Work Order shuts income-driven repayment options down for at least \nthree months, but does not specify when, if ever, they will be reinstated.   \n77.  The Department’s action also precludes borrowers from recertifying their income \nso that they can remain in an income-driven repayment plan.  \n78.  The Department’s action applies to all online and paper applications.  \n79.  The Department also put a notice on its website confirming this decision, though it \nblamed the Eighth Circuit, saying: “Application Unavailable. A federal court issued an injunction \npreventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable \nEducation (SAVE) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. As a result, the \nIDR and online loan consolidation applications are temporarily unavailable.” \n80.  In other words, despite its obligation to ensure borrowers’ access to IBR and ICR \nplans,  and  despite  its  ability  to  do  so  notwithstanding  the  Eighth  Circuit’s  decisions,  the \nDepartment has halted borrowers’ ability to enroll in these programs.   \nThe Department’s Decision Harms Borrowers, Including AFT and its members  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 14 of 19\n \n81.  The Department’s decision to shut off IDR is actively harming borrowers.  \n82.  Borrowers with lower earnings cannot access any IDR plans. Denied access to \nstatutorily mandated repayment options, many are stuck on unaffordable repayment plans that they \nare unable to pay. Many of these borrowers will likely default on their loans as a result of the \nDepartment’s decisions not to follow the statutes.  \n83.  Similarly, thousands of eligible public service workers are stuck in either the SAVE \nforbearance or in plans that are not PSLF-eligible. Because of the Department’s actions, thousands \nof eligible public service workers are being denied progress towards the student loan forgiveness \nto which they are statutorily entitled.  \n84.  Some borrowers who are in default now lack access to an IDR plan that would, \nfollowing certain steps, allow them to get back on the path of re-payment.  \n85.  AFT, and its members, are a case in point. Thousands of AFT members are eligible \nfor each and every one of the statutorily required repayment plans described above. Thousands of \nAFT members have contractual rights to participate in each of these statutorily required repayment \nplans. \n86.  One member, Rachel Dubreuil, teaches high school Social Studies at a technical \nhigh school. She dedicated herself to public service as a teacher and has taught for over ten years. \nRachel was on track to have most of her loans forgiven in November of 2024, but that progress \nwas halted overnight. In July 2024, her loans, which had been in the SAVE plan, were placed into \nan administrative forbearance. As previously discussed, her time in this forbearance does not count \ntoward PSLF. Additionally, she has applied for PSLF forgiveness, but her time since July 2024 is \nnot being credited. She has also applied for IDR payment plan change, and to have her forbearance \ntime counted though a special program known as the “Buy Back” program, but none of these \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 15 of 19\n \napplications have been processed. The stress from this debt, and the sheer tension that it causes on \nher day to day, is unbearable. Through no fault of her own, Rachel is unable to make payments \nbased on her income and to progress toward PSLF forgiveness, and is therefore being deprived her \nstatutory and contractual rights. As a result, she will owe her debt for longer than if she was able \nto enroll and progress under an IDR plan. \n87.  Another member, Corey Mason, took out loans to become a teacher in order to \nfulfill a lifelong dream of helping children who were marginalized or otherwise left out. To better \nmeet her students’ needs, she ultimately earned a master’s degree and a Sixth-Year Certificate. \nShe incurred more debt to pay for both credentials. Corey has 117 of her 120 payments necessary \nto have her debt cancelled under PSLF, but has been unable to earn her final months of payments, \nthrough no fault of her own. During the summer of 2024, her loans were placed into forbearance \nbecause of the SAVE plan litigation. She requested that her loans be moved into another qualifying \nrepayment plan, but was told that that was not possible. Despite this, she continued to make \nvoluntary payments on her loans. In November 2024, when she believed she had achieved 120 \npayments for PSLF, she submitted a “Buy Back” application in an effort to make her time in \nforbearance count toward forgiveness. As of March 2025, approximately three months later, her \napplication has not been processed and she is still waiting for a determination. In an effort to \nremedy the situation, Corey has filed complaints, has resubmitted her “Buy Back” application, and \nhas submitted a new IDR plan to remove her loans from forbearance. To the best of her knowledge, \nthese requests have not been processed. She continues to make payments in the hope that they will \neventually be counted toward PSLF, but feels as though she is stuck in limbo while ED has cut off \nher access to IDR plans and to debt forgiveness.  \n88.  Critically, these members would all have standing in their own right to sue.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 16 of 19\n \n89.  AFT, however, is vindicating their interests because, as highlighted above, the \nissues are at the heart of AFT’s purpose.  \n90.  No individual member is a necessary party in this case as the claims and relief \nsought are challenging an unlawful government policy that is being applied in the same manner as \nto all individuals.  \n91.  The Department’s unlawful action is also harming AFT as an organization because \nits resources have been, and continue to be, diverted to address the unlawful conduct, which \ndirectly impedes its ability to develop and implement additional financial literacy programs and \nresources that it had planned for its members. It has had to increase its efforts to assist its members \nwith their student loans as a result of the Department’s shut down of the IDR applications. \n \nCAUSES OF ACTION \n \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nUnlawful Withholding of Agency Action in Violation of the  \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n \n92.  The  APA  authorizes  this  Court  to  “compel  agency  action”  that  has  been \n“unlawfully withheld.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n93.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to offer borrowers access to an IBR repayment plan. \n94.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to offer borrowers access to an ICR repayment plan. \n95.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to cancel the balance of any borrower who has made 120 PSLF-qualifying \npayments. \n96.  Following the Stop Work Order, Defendants are unlawfully preventing borrowers \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 17 of 19\n \nfrom accessing any IBR program. \n97.  Following the Stop Work Order, Defendants are unlawfully preventing borrowers \nfrom accessing any ICR program. \n98.  Following the Stop Work Order, Defendants ire unlawfully withholding PSLF \nforgiveness. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action in Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n \n99.  The  APA  prohibits  agency  action  that  is  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n100.  The Department’s decision to halt access to all IDR plans constitutes a final agency \naction under the APA.  \n101.  Defendants have acted  in  a manner that is  arbitrary, capricious,  an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law by, among other actions: \na.  The Department’s abrupt and unjustified halting of the IBR and ICR plans is \ninconsistent with the governing statute and regulation. \nb.  The Department’s abrupt and unjustified halting IBR and ICR plans is inconsistent \nwith its contractual obligations. \nc.  The Department’s abrupt and unjustified halting of the IBR and ICR plan is not \nmandated by the Eighth Circuit’s decision, is without any rational basis, and is \narbitrary and capricious. \nd.  The Department’s hold on PSLF relief is inconsistent with the governing statute \nand regulation. \ne.  The  Department’s  hold  on  PSLF  relief  is  inconsistent  with  its  contractual \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 18 of 19\n \nobligations. \nf.  The Department’s hold on PSLF relief is not mandated by the Eighth Circuit’s \ndecision, is without any rational basis, and is arbitrary and capricious. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the Department is unlawfully withholding the IBR and ICR programs;  \nB.  Declare that the Department is unlawfully withholding PSLF program in contravention of \nlaw;  \nC.  Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  preventing  the  Department  from \ncollecting from borrowers who are eligible for income-driven repayment until it satisfies \nits statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations under IBR, ICR, and PSLF. \nD.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief compelling the Department to comply \nwith its statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations, by:  \na.  Complying with the IBR statute by restoring an IBR plan; \nb.  Complying with the ICR statute by restoring an ICR plan; \nc.  Complying with the PSLF statute by restoring public service workers’ ability to \nobtain credit toward PSLF forgiveness and timely granting PSLF forgiveness to \nthose borrowers.   \nE.  Award attorneys’ fees as authorized by law; and \nF.  Grant such further relief as may be just and proper. \n \n \n \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802     Document 1     Filed 03/18/25     Page 19 of 19\n \nDate: March 18, 2025       /s/Julie Selesnick     \nJulie Selesnick, DC Bar No. 485558 \nBERGER MONTAGUE PC \n1001 G Street, NW \nSuite 400 East \nWashington, DC 20001 \nT. 202.221.5279 \nF. 215.875.4604 \njselesnick@bm.net \n \n            Persis Yu, DC Bar # 90014714 \nSTUDENT BORROWER PROTECTION \nCENTER (a fiscally sponsored project of the \nShared Ascent Fund) \n1025 Connecticut Ave NW, #717 \n(202) 618-1328 \npersis@protectborrowers.org \n \nR.

The United States government, through the United States Department of Education \n(“the Department”), is the country’s largest creditor of student loans. Today, there are nearly 43 \nmillion federal student loan borrowers, with approximately $1.62 trillion outstanding in debt.  \n2.  Congress designed the federal student loan program to expand access to higher \neducation and increase economic mobility regardless of one’s financial station. To that end, when \ndesigning and modifying the federal student loan system, Congress provided clear and specific \ndirectives to the Department so that millions of Americans could repay their loans without being \nhindered by the debt. Specifically, Congress directed the Department to offer income-driven \nrepayment (“IDR”) plans that tie a borrower’s monthly payment to their income and provide debt \ncancellation after a prescribed period of time. \n3.  Notwithstanding this clear Congressional command, the Department withheld IDR \nplans and their benefits from millions of borrowers. Although the Department has nominally \nrestored these plans, in practice more than a million borrowers still do not have access to their \nCongressionally mandated benefits.  The Department has not indicated when it will grant complete \naccess to the programs.      \n4.  The same is true of the Department’s administration of the Public Service Loan \nForgiveness (“PSLF”) program. Public service workers who have satisfied all requirements to have \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 3 of 37\n \ntheir loans cancelled under the federal program are being deprived this right to promptly have their \ndebt forgiven.  \n5.  The result: borrowers are and have been unable to access affordable monthly \npayment plans, some borrowers are being and have been thrust into default on their debt, and some \nborrowers are being denied their right to have their loans cancelled through IDR or PSLF. For \nthose borrowers who have satisfied the statutory requirements to have their debts cancelled but \nwhose loans the Department has not cancelled, they are trapped in a debt that legally they should \nno longer owe. This debt continues to appear on credit reports restricting borrowers’ ability to \naccess credit to purchase homes, cars, and other necessities, and with looming tax consequences if \naction is not taken swiftly. These borrowers must also make payments on a debt that should no \nlonger exist for fear of becoming delinquent, or agree to be placed in a forbearance with no clear \nend date. \n6.  This is not occurring in a vacuum for student loan borrowers. It comes in the context \nof the President repeatedly announcing his plans to close the Department of Education, which was \ncreated by an Act of Congress. And, it is on the heels of the recent equally-unlawful actions to gut \ncritical student loan protections that had, until recently, been provided by the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau.  \n7.  Although the Department began to process pending IDR applications after this case \nwas filed, the slow rate of processing and the lack of transparency with respect to whether \nprocessed applications are being correctly approved or denied do not meaningfully address the \nreality that borrowers are still being denied their statutory rights to affordable payment plans and \nto debt cancellation. As of July 31, 2025, there are 1,386,406 pending applications, but the \nDepartment’s processing rate and the rate of new applications being filed results in only an average \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 4 of 37\n \nnet decrease of 87,823 applications per month. At this rate, borrowers may have to wait years to \nreceive the benefits that Congress directed should be provided to them. \n8.  For borrowers who have met their statutory requirements to have their debts \ncancelled pursuant to IDR but whose cancellation the Department is withholding also face a form \nof fiscal cliff: pursuant to the American Recovery Plan Act, for loans not cancelled on or before \nDecember 31, 2025, the cancelled amount will be considered taxable income for federal income \ntax purposes. If the Department does not process their cancellations before this deadline, these \nborrowers will literally pay for the government’s inaction. \n9.  The burden of this misconduct is already being felt by Plaintiff the American \nFederation of Teachers (“AFT”), and its 1.8 million members. A significant number of AFT’s \nmembers have student debt, are working in public service, and have sought or will try to seek \naccess to an IDR plan. AFT’s resources have been and will continue to be diverted to address the \nconfusion caused by the Department’s decision to leave millions of borrowers in IDR limbo.  \n10.  The Department’s unlawful activity is especially harmful for Named Plaintiffs, who \nare long-term borrowers and public service workers entitled to have their debts cancelled through \nthe IDR and PSLF programs. Plaintiffs Naugle, Whitley, Cashman, and Iverson have more than \nsatisfied the requirements to have their debts cancelled through IDR, whereas Plaintiffs Dubreuil \nand Wegner have met the requirements to have their debts cancelled through PSLF. Due to the \nDepartment’s unlawful withholding of these statutory rights, Named Plaintiffs and the millions of \nborrowers whom they represent are being trapped in debt, and many will face enormous tax \nliability if the Department does not follow the law and cancel their loans before January 1, 2026. \n11.  At bottom, these borrowers simply want to pay back their student loans according \nto the terms that Congress, and their contracts, provide. Therefore, AFT, on its own behalf and on \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 5 of 37\n \nbehalf of its members, and Named Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit to compel the Department to abide \nby Congress’s command and provide borrowers with the ability to re-pay their loans through the \naffordable, income-driven repayment plans to which they are entitled, and to cancel their debts \nwhen they have satisfied all applicable requirements for those plans and for the PSLF program.    \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § \n1331, the Mandamus Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1361, the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701-706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201(a) and 2202. \n13.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because Plaintiff \nAFT’s headquarters is in D.C., because Defendants reside in D.C. and because a substantial part \nof the events giving rise to these claims occurred in this District. \nPARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff AFT is a membership organization representing 1.8 million pre-K through \n12th-grade  teachers,  early  childhood  educators,  paraprofessionals,  and  other  school-related \npersonnel; higher education faculty and professional staff; federal, state, and local government \nemployees; and nurses and other healthcare professionals.  \n15.  AFT’s headquarters is in Washington, D.C. Its 1.8 million members belong to more \nthan 3000 locals across all fifty U.S. states.  \n16.  AFT’s mission is to promote fairness, democracy, economic opportunity, and high-\nquality  public  education,  healthcare,  and  public  services  for  students,  their  families  and \ncommunities. It meets this mission by ensuring its members receive fair pay and benefits for their \ncritical work, and by fighting for safe working conditions that also benefit students, patients, and \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 6 of 37\n \nall those who use public services. Helping children and students, and ensuring the economic \nsecurity and dignity of AFT’s members and their families, is at the core of this mission. \n17.  As part of this work, AFT takes a leading role in fighting for the financial stability \nof public service, education, and health care workers, particularly when it comes to the increasingly \ncrippling costs of education. \n18.  Many of AFT’s members have student loan debt and 75% of AFT’s members work \nin roles that require a higher education degree and are eligible for PSLF. \n19.  Thousands of AFT’s members have previous access and/or are eligible for the \nIncome-Based Repayment Plan, the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan, the Pay as You Earn \nPlan, and the Revised Pay as You Earn Plan, each defined and described below. \n20.  However, according to a survey of AFT members who struggle financially, 8 in 10 \nsay student debt is a “major burden,” and it is a major driver of financial difficulties as compared \nto any other debt.1 The result: 78% of these members report that they or someone in their household \nhas previously fallen behind on making debt payments, and one in three have had their debts go \ninto default. \n21.  AFT is required by its mission to provide its members with assistance and accurate \ninformation on student loan repayment and PSLF—which is made all the more difficult by the \nDepartment’s misconduct, as well as the firing of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s \nStudent Loan Ombudsman, the removal of the complaint function on StudentAid.gov, and the \nfiring of nearly all of the staff at federal student aid dedicated to resolving student loan borrower \ncomplaints. \n \n1 https://www.aft.org/sites/default/files/media/2018/ppt_aft-member-debt_hart2018.pdf. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 7 of 37\n \n22.  Under the leadership of AFT President Randi Weingarten, AFT has spent, and \ncontinues to spend, tens of thousands of dollars on debt clinics to educate members to better \nnavigate their repayment options, and it has diverted more than two thousand hours of valuable \nstaff time that would otherwise have been spent focused on issues like collective bargaining; \nretirement security; healthcare; student learning conditions; and educators’, public employees’ and \nhealth care workers’ working conditions. Since the Department shut down access to IDR plans, \nAFT staff have had to redraft clinic curriculum and have diverted significant additional staff time \nto  answering  member  questions,  including  holding  11  student  debt  clinic  webinars  with \napproximately 420 registrants. AFT staff have had to significantly update its debt clinic curriculum \ntwice since April 2025 to reflect the many changes to the availability of IDR and PSLF. The AFT \nis committed to expanding economic security programs for members and was developing a new \nfinancial literacy clinic curriculum to help members. The program development has been delayed \ndue to the actions of the Department and the new demand from members with student debt. The \nAFT was preparing to end a multi-year contract with a tech company called Summer which \nprovided direct services to members with student debt. Due to the uncertainty and lack of \ncommunication from the Department, the union has had to reallocate resources and extend the \ncontract through June 2026.  \n23.  The relief sought in this complaint would inure to the benefit of thousands of AFT \nmembers who are actually injured by the Department’s violations of the statutes requiring that \nincome-driven repayment plans be available with applications processed in a timely manner, that \nborrowers  who  have  satisfied  the  income-driven  repayment  plans’  requirements  for  debt \ncancellation have their loans cancelled after 20 or 25 years, and that borrowers who work in public \nservice and have satisfied the PSLF requirements can have their loans cancelled after 10 years. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 8 of 37\n \n24.  Plaintiff Lisa Naugle is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times to \nthis action has resided, in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Plaintiff Naugle owes approximately \n$198,000 in federal student loan debt, which she has been paying for over 25 years without \ndelinquency or default. According to her account on StudentAid.gov, she has been eligible to have \nher loans cancelled through the IDR program since May 2025, but the Department has not \ncancelled her loans. \n25.  Plaintiff Philip Whitley is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times to \nthis action has resided, in the Province of Nouvelle-Aquitaine, France. Plaintiff Whitley owes \napproximately $756,605 in federal student loan debt, which he has been paying for over 25 years \nwithout delinquency or default. According to a letter that Plaintiff Whitley received from the \nDepartment’s Office of Federal Student Aid in or around February 2025, he had already satisfied \nthe requirements to have his loans cancelled through the IDR program, but the Department has not \ncancelled his loans.  \n26.  Plaintiff Sandy Cashman is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times \nto  this  action  has  resided,  in  Olympia, Washington.  Plaintiff  Cashman  owes  approximately \n$115,000 in federal student loan debt, which she has been paying for over 20 years without \ndelinquency or default. In or around July 2025, a representative of the Department at the Office of \nFederal Student Aid informed Plaintiff Cashman that she had satisfied her repayment obligations \nand that her loans were eligible to be cancelled through the IDR program, but the Department has \nnot cancelled her loans. Plaintiff Cashman is a member of the AFT. \n27.  Plaintiff Kiva Iverson is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times to \nthis action has resided, in Culver City, California. Plaintiff Iverson owes approximately $252,659 \nin federal student loan debt, which she has been paying for over 25 years without delinquency or \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 9 of 37\n \ndefault. In or around the Spring or early Summer of 2025, a representative of the Department at \nthe Office of Federal Student Aid advised Plaintiff Iverson to apply for the  Income Based \nRepayment (IBR) plan from the Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) plan because she had \nalready accrued 324 months of the 300 necessary qualifying payments to have her loans cancelled \nthrough IBR. She applied in July 2025 but her application was denied in August 2025 on the \ngrounds that she does not have a “partial financial hardship,” which has not been a requirement \nfor the IBR plan since the enactment of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The Department therefore \nimproperly denied her access to a payment plan for which she is eligible and is withholding loan \ncancellation. Plaintiff Iverson is a member of the AFT. \n28.  Plaintiff Rachel Dubreuil is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times \nto this action has resided, in Westbrook, Connecticut. Plaintiff Dubreuil owes approximately \n$87,000 in federal student loan debt, which she has been paying for over 10 years without \ndelinquency or default while pursuing PSLF. By July 2024, she had accrued 115 of the 120 \nnecessary qualifying payments for PSLF, and was on track to reach 120 payments for most of her \nloans by November 2024. The Department placed Plaintiff Dubreuil’s loans, along with the loans \nof millions of other borrowers, into an involuntary forbearance in July 2024, during which time \nshe was unable to accrue more credit toward PSLF. Beginning in December 2024, and then again \nin January and April 2025, Plaintiff Dubreuil submitted PSLF Buyback applications to recoup \nthese months in forbearance for PSLF. The Department has not processed her applications. She \nalso applied for the IBR plan in January 2025, and was approved in July 2025, but she has not \nbeen able to make payments on the plan due to an error between the Department and its student \nloan servicer, and so was placed in another forbearance. The Department is therefore withholding \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 10 of 37\n \nPlaintiff Dubreuil’s statutory right to cancellation through PSLF and to accrue more PSLF credit \nthrough the IBR plan. Plaintiff Dubreuil is a member of the AFT. \n29.  Plaintiff Theodore Wegner is a natural person who resides, and at all relevant times \nto this action has resided, in District of Columbia. Plaintiff Wegner owes approximately $104,000 \nin federal student loan debt, which he has been paying for over 10 years without delinquency or \ndefault while pursuing PSLF. His records on StudentAid.gov show that he has 113 of the 120 \nnecessary qualifying payments for PSLF, and was on track to reach 120 payments for his loans by \naround January 2025. The Department placed Plaintiff Wegner’s loans, along with the loans of \nmillions of other borrowers, into an involuntary forbearance in July 2024, during which time he \nwas unable to accrue more credit toward PSLF. In February 2025, and then again in July 2025, \nPlaintiff Wegner submitted PSLF Buyback applications to recoup these months in forbearance for \nPSLF. The Department has not processed his applications. He also applied for the IBR plan in \nFebruary 2025, but the Department has not processed his application. The Department is therefore \nwithholding Plaintiff Wegner’s statutory right to cancellation through PSLF and to accrue more \nPSLF credit through the IBR plan. \n30.  Defendant United States Department of Education is a federal agency with its \nprincipal  place  of  business  at  400  Maryland Avenue  SW,  Washington,  D.C.  Defendant  is \nresponsible for administering federal student loan and grant programs in the United States. \n31.  Defendant Linda McMahon is the Secretary of Education (Secretary). Plaintiffs sue \nSecretary McMahon in her official capacity. Secretary McMahon is charged with the supervision \nand management of all decisions and actions of the United States Department of Education, and \nso all allegations in this complaint against the Department of Education are made against her. \nBACKGROUND \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 11 of 37\n \nIncome-Driven Repayment Plans \n32.  In 1965, Congress enacted the Higher Education Act (HEA) because “every citizen \nis entitled to an education to meet his or her full potential without financial barriers.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1221-1(2)  (emphasis  added).  In  other  words,  Congress  aimed  to  “increase  educational \nopportunities” and help students access the “benefits of postsecondary education.”  Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2362 (2023). \n33.  In 1994, Congress amended the HEA and created the William D. Ford Federal \nDirect Loan Program. This program increased the government’s ability to directly lend money to \nstudents. As a result, the student loan system shifted from one mostly involving private lenders to \none in which the U.S. government became the primary creditor of student loans.  \n34.  To  ensure  that  student  loans  bolstered—rather  than  hampered–economic \nopportunity, Congress provided the Secretary with a clear directive: offer students various loan \nrepayment options, including some that tether the borrower’s monthly payment to their income. \nSuch plans are known as income-driven repayment plans.  \n35.  Specifically, Congress enacted two statutory provisions requiring income-driven \nrepayment plans.  \n36.  First, Congress requires the Secretary to offer “Income-Based Repayment” plans \n(“IBR”). See 20 U.S.C. § 1098e.  \n37.  The IBR statute provides an “income-based” affordable repayment plan for federal \nstudent loan borrowers for whom paying their full loans would be a financial hardship. Congress \ncreated the IBR to respond to the rising costs of college, a corresponding increase in student loan \ndebt, and the increasing number of borrowers defaulting. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 12 of 37\n \n38.  Congress used mandatory language when setting out the Secretary’s requirement to \noffer an IBR plan, saying: the “Secretary shall carry out a program under which a borrower . . . \nwho has a partial financial hardship . . . may elect, during any period the borrower has the partial \nfinancial hardship, to have the borrower’s aggregate monthly payment for all such loans not \nexceed” a payment formula set by statute. 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b). To ensure that borrowers would \nnot remain indebted forever, Congress provided that the Secretary must cancel a borrower’s \noutstanding principal and interest due if they have ever elected to participate in IBR and once they \nhave made qualifying payments for a period not to exceed 25 years. See 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b)(7). \nThe HEA provides five types of payments, including payments pursuant to the IBR plan, that count \nas qualifying payments for the purpose of qualifying for debt cancellation. Id.      \n39.  The Department has similarly acknowledged that it has a mandatory duty to offer \nIBR to borrowers. 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820, 43,837 (Department “do[es] not believe that sunsetting \nthe IBR plan is permitted by section 493C(b) of the HEA which authorized the IBR plan.”).   \n40.  The One Big Beautiful Bill upon enactment ended any requirement that borrowers \nhave to demonstrate a partial financial hardship to access IBR. Pub. L. 119-21, 139 Stat. 72, 348, \n356 (July 4, 2025). \n41.  Second, Congress requires the Secretary to create and implement an “Income-\nContingent” repayment plan (“ICR”).  \n42.  The ICR statute was passed in 1993. \n43.  The ICR statute mandates that “The Secretary shall offer a borrower of a loan . . . \nan income contingent repayment plan, with varying annual repayment amounts based on the \nincome of the borrower.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D). \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 13 of 37\n \n44.  The Department has also acknowledged its mandatory obligation to offer ICR to \ndirect loan borrowers. See 90 Fed. Reg. 3695 (Jan. 15, 2025) (explaining that certain changes were \nbeing made to meet the “Department’s statutory obligation under the HEA to offer borrowers an \nincome-contingent repayment plan.”). Like the IBR statute, the ICR statute provides that the \npayment term for ICR shall not exceed 25 years. 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D). \n45.  Over time, the Secretary has crafted four different options to effectuate these \nstatutory directives.  \n46.  Each payment plan has different characteristics that vary meaningfully with respect \nto the calculation of monthly payments, the length of the repayment term (and if/when the loans \nare forgiven after a certain amount of time in repayment), and the amount of discretionary income \nthat factors into the equation.  \n47.  Implementing the commands of the IBR statute, the Secretary created the Income-\nBased Repayment Plan. \n48.  And implementing the commands of the ICR statute, the Secretary created three \nplans: the Income-Contingent Repayment Plan (ICR Plan), the Pay As You Earn plan (PAYE Plan), \nand the Revised Pay As Your Earn plan (REPAYE Plan, later, as described below, renamed the \nSAVE Plan). Pursuant to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, for existing borrowers, the ICR, PAYE, \nand SAVE plans will sunset and no longer be available as of July 1, 2028, whereas the IBR plan \nwill remain available indefinitely. See Pub. L. No. 119-21 at sec. 82001 et seq. \n49.  In  addition  to  its  statutory  and  regulatory  obligations,  the  Department  has \ncontractual obligations to ensure that borrowers can access these plans. \n50.  When a borrower first takes out a student loan, they sign a legally enforceable \npromissory note with the Department of Education.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 14 of 37\n \n51.  In addition to identifying the borrower’s obligations, the contract identifies the \nborrower’s rights under the contract.  \n52.  These rights include the ability to repay the loans under one of these different \nincome-driven repayment plans.  \n53.  Indeed, the contract includes an entire section on the different plans, and crystalizes \nthat “[u]nder an income-driven repayment plan, your required monthly payment amount is based \non your income and family size, instead of being based on your loan debt, interest rate, and \nrepayment period, as under a traditional repayment plan.”  \n54.  The four statutorily-mandated IDR plans have been a lifeline in preventing student \nloan borrowers from default. This saves borrowers from the punitive impacts of such a default, \nincluding the potential seizure of tax refunds, wages, or government benefits. \n55.  When a borrower satisfies the statutory repayment obligations under an IDR plan, \nCongress provided that their loans should be automatically cancelled, with no further action by the \nborrower. See 20 U.S.C. § 1098(e)(b)(7).        \n56.  Prior to March 2021, when borrowers satisfied the statutory requirements for loan \ncancellation under one of the IDR plans, namely enrollment in an IDR plan for 20 or 25 years, the \ncancelled amount was typically treated as taxable income.  See 26 U.S.C. § 108(e)(1). However, \nin March 2021, through the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Congress provided that no federal \nstudent loan cancellation shall be a taxable event for federal income tax purposes for discharges \noccurring after December 31, 2020, and before January 1, 2026.  26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5).  Borrowers \nwho satisfy the requirements for loan cancellation through the end of 2025 are entitled by statute \nto this tax treatment, the consequences of which are extremely significant for individuals.      \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 15 of 37\n \n57.  Although historically it was difficult for borrowers to track their progress toward \ndebt  cancellation  under  the  IDR  plans,  the  Biden Administration  introduced  a  tracker  on \nborrowers’ StudentAid.gov accounts that shows them their number of qualifying payments they \nhave accrued and the number of qualifying remaining until their loans are eligible for cancellation.      \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness \n58.  In addition to providing borrowers with access to IDR plans, Congress also requires \nthe Secretary to discharge a borrower’s student debt in certain circumstances. \n59.  Most notably, federal law provides loan cancellation for public service workers who \nhave worked for ten years in eligible public service jobs while making eligible payments on their \nloans. 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1).  \n60.  The PSLF statute states: that the Secretary of Education “shall cancel the balance \nof interest and principal due . . . on any eligible Federal Direct Loan” for a borrower who “has \nmade 120” eligible “monthly payments on the eligible Federal Direct Loan after October 1, 2007” \nand “has been employed in a public service job during the period in which the borrower ma[de] \neach of the 120 payments.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1). \n61.  To be eligible for PSLF, a borrower must be enrolled in a standard repayment plan \n(in which case the borrower pays the entire debt off over a period of ten years), or one of the \nincome-driven repayment plans.    \n62.  The Secretary has issued implementing regulations for the PSLF statute which \nfurther requires the Secretary to provide loan discharges to borrowers who have satisfied the \neligibility criteria. \n63.  Just as with IDR, the borrower’s initial master promissory note informs borrowers \nof their PSLF rights, telling borrowers that “Under this program, we will forgive the remaining \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 16 of 37\n \nbalance due on your Direct Loans after you have made 120 payments (after October 1, 2007) on \nthose loans under certain repayment plans while you are employed full-time by a qualifying \nemployer.”2 \n64.  PSLF has been key in allowing individuals to serve their communities and the \npublic without fear that their student loan debt will drive them into poverty.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nThe Prior Administration Issues a New IDR Rule, but States Sue to Block the Effort \n65.  On July 10, 2023, the Department of Education issued a final rule to improve its \nREPAYE plan.  \n66.  In the Rule, the Department renamed the “REPAYE Plan” the “SAVE Plan,” and \nmade changes so that it would be the best option for the bulk of student loan borrowers. See \nImproving Income Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program and \nthe Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program, 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820.  \n67.  In an effort to simplify borrowers’ options, the Rule also sunsetted enrollment in \nthe ICR and PAYE Plans.  \n68.  Certain provisions of the Rule were designated for early implementation and went \ninto effect in 2023. See 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820; 88 Fed. Reg. 72,685. \n69.  As a result, millions of student loan borrowers, including thousands of public \nservice workers, enrolled in the SAVE Plan in 2023 and the first half of 2024.   \n70.  Though the SAVE Plan was designed to help millions of borrowers, in April 2024, \na group of states sued the Department to challenge the Rule in the U.S. District Court for the \nEastern District of Missouri.  \n \n2 With the exception of the change in eligibility for medical residency, the One Big Beautiful Bill did not \nchange the requirements for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 17 of 37\n \n71.  The states’ lawsuit does not challenge the IBR statute or regulations, nor does the \nlawsuit challenge the PSLF statute or regulations. The lawsuit also does not challenge the legality \nof the ICR Plan or the PAYE Plan.  \n72.  On June 24, 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri \npreliminarily enjoined the Department from providing loan forgiveness under the SAVE Rule.  \n73.  On July 18, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted the states’ emergency \nmotion for an administrative stay prohibiting the Department from implementing the new Rule, \nand on August 9, 2024, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals enjoined portions of the SAVE Plan \npending appeal.   \n74.  On February 18, 2025, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals issued its opinion. It \nagreed with the district court and concluded the states would likely succeed in showing that the \nforgiveness provisions of the SAVE Rule were invalid. It found the provision un-severable from \nthe rest of the Rule and therefore affirmed the injunction.  \n75.  The Eighth Circuit also opined on the forgiveness provisions of the pre-2023 \nversion of the REPAYE rule. It said that the forgiveness provisions of the prior REPAYE rule were \nlikely invalid. It did not otherwise speak to the rest of the pre-2023 REPAYE plan, nor preclude \nthe Department from utilizing it in the future.  \n76.  The Eighth Circuit’s decisions do not impact the IBR statute, regulations, or the \nDepartment’s contractual obligations with respect to IBR.  \n77.  The Eighth Circuit’s decisions do not impact the PSLF statute, regulations, or the \nDepartment’s contractual obligations with respect to PSLF. \n78.  The Eighth Circuit also did not enjoin the Department from using the ICR plan or \nthe PAYE plan. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 18 of 37\n \n79.  On April 14, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri \nmodified its preliminary injunction to conform with the Eighth Circuit’s February order, and did \nnot enjoin or touch on the IBR statute, the PSLF, or the ICR and PAYE plans.  \nDuring the Litigation, the Prior Administration Provides Borrowers with Access to IDR to \nMeet its Statutory Obligation \n80.  In the face of this litigation, the prior Administration took a number of steps in 2024 \nand January 2025 to adhere to the court order and offer borrowers the repayment plans mandated \nby statute, regulation, and contract.  \n81.  On July 19, 2024, the day after the Eighth Circuit granted an emergency stay, the \nDepartment placed all borrowers who had been making payments in the SAVE Plan into a \nforbearance (i.e., a status during which the Department delays the borrower’s obligation to make \nmonthly payments) (the “SAVE litigation forbearance”). Unlike most other forbearances, the \nDepartment provided that loans would not accrue interest while in this special SAVE litigation \nforbearance, but also that months during this forbearance would not count as months of eligible \npayment for IDR or PSLF purposes. \n82.  From July to October 2024, the Department ensured borrowers could apply for IBR \nusing a paper or PDF application form.  \n83.  On  October  2,  2024,  the  Department  of  Education  re-opened  its  online  IBR \napplication. \n84.  The Department also recognized its obligation to offer a plan under the ICR statute, \nand that the Eighth Circuit did not preclude it from doing so. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 19 of 37\n \n85.  On November 15, 2024, the Department of Education issued an Interim Final Rule \nto ensure that it was “in compliance with the statutory requirement to offer an income-contingent \nrepayment plan to borrowers.”  \n86.  Under this Rule, the Department reversed its sunsetting of the ICR and PAYE plans, \nallowing borrowers to enroll in ICR or PAYE until July 1, 2027.  \n87.  On January 15, 2025, the Department finalized its Rule allowing borrowers to \nenroll in ICR or PAYE until July 1, 2027. \n88.  As a result, as of 11:59 a.m. on January 20, 2025, the Department offered borrowers \nenrollment in plans under both the IBR and ICR statutes.   \nOn February 26, 2025, The Current Administration Halted Access to IDR Plans \n89.  Under the current legal landscape, the Department of Education can offer three IDR \nplans and still comply with the Eighth Circuit’s decisions: the IBR plan, the ICR plan, and the \nPAYE plan. It can also utilize the bulk of the prior REPAYE plan.  \n90.  Indeed, the Eighth Circuit specifically distinguished the IBR statute and IBR plan \nwhen discussing the purported problems with the Department’s new Rule. \n91.  Nonetheless, on February 26, 2025, the current Administration issued a Stop Work \nOrder, directing all loan servicers to stop accepting and processing income-driven repayment \napplications. \n92.  The Stop Work Order shut down income-driven repayment options for borrowers \nseeking to enroll or switch plans, but did not specify when, if ever, they would be reinstated.   \n93.  The Department’s action also precluded borrowers from recertifying their income \nso that they could remain in an income-driven repayment plan.  \n94.  The Department’s action applied to all online and paper applications.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 20 of 37\n \n95.  The Department also put a notice on its website confirming this decision, though it \nblamed the Eighth Circuit, saying: “Application Unavailable. A federal court issued an injunction \npreventing the U.S. Department of Education from implementing the Saving on a Valuable \nEducation (SAVE) Plan and parts of other income-driven repayment (IDR) plans. As a result, the \nIDR and online loan consolidation applications are temporarily unavailable.” \n96.  In other words, despite its obligation to ensure borrowers’ access to IBR and ICR \nplans,  and  despite  its  ability  to  do  so  notwithstanding  the  Eighth  Circuit’s  decisions,  the \nDepartment halted borrowers’ ability to enroll in these programs.   \nThe Department Begins Processing IDR Applications, But Borrowers Are Still Deprived IDR \nPlans \n97.  On March 18, 2025, AFT initiated this action against the Department to restore \naccess to IDR for millions of borrowers. \n98.  The Department announced that it would restore the IDR application by March 26, \n2025, and that it would begin processing applications by May 10, 2025. \n99.  Pursuant to a status conference held April 17, 2025, the Court ordered that the \nDepartment shall file a minimum of three monthly status reports, commencing May 15, 2025, in \nwhich it would provide the total outstanding number of pending IDR applications as of the end of \nthe prior calendar month as well as the number of IDR applications processed during the prior \ncalendar month. (ECF No. 34.)      \n100.  The Department’s status reports revealed that between April and July, the backlog \nof pending IDR applications dropped by only 263,468, from 1,649,874 to 1,386,406.3 (ECF Nos. \n \n3   The Department’s first monthly report in May 2025, which reflected the number of applications processed \nand pending for the month of April, stated that there were 1,985,726 applications pending. (ECF No. 36.) \nIn the subsequent report, filed in June, the Department clarified that its previous report had overstated the \n \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 21 of 37\n \n36-39.) The data show an average net decrease each month of only 87,823 applications, and do not \nshow a breakdown of approved or denied applications. \n101.  On or around July 18, 2025, it was reported that the Department would summarily \ndeny pending IDR applications from borrowers who requested to be placed in the plan that would \nresult in the lowest monthly payment. The approved form in use prior to March 26, 2025, not just \nallowed, but recommended that borrowers select the option that would result in the lowest monthly \npayment. The terms and conditions articulated the way that the Department would place eligible \nborrowers  in  a  plan,  should  multiple  repayment  plans  provide  the same  payment  amount.4  \nAccording to reports, an estimated 460,000 borrowers will have their application rejected and will \nhave to apply for IDR again and select a specific plan. Although this will likely result in a \nsignificant decrease in the number of pending IDR applications, it does not reflect the true \nprocessing rate demonstrated by the monthly status reports.  \n102.  During this lengthy processing time, borrowers are deprived their rights to be \nenrolled in an IDR plan. Even if a borrower is ultimately deemed ineligible for the plan for which \nthey applied, the months waiting for a determination is lost time during which they could have \nenrolled in a plan for which they are eligible and made meaningful progress toward repaying their \nloan.      \n \nnumber of pending applications by 335,852. (ECF No. 37.) It explained that this was “due to an error by \none of the Department of Education’s student-loan servicers in reporting data to the Department of \nEducation.” Id. The Department  did  not  explain further what  caused  the error  or  provide whether \nprecautions were taken by the Department or its student loan servicers to ensure no additional mistakes \nwould be made. \n4 In relevant part, the form stated: “If more than one of the plans that I selected provides the same initial \npayment amount, or if my loan holder is determining which of the income-driven plans I qualify for, that \nmy loan holder use the following order in choosing my plan: SAVE (if my repayment period is 20 years), \nPAYE, SAVE (if my repayment period is 25 years), IBR, and then ICR.” \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 22 of 37\n \n103.  The time spent waiting for their applications to be processed harms borrowers, both \nbecause this time does not count toward certain statutory loan cancellation programs, and in that \nit allows interest to accrue at a time when borrowers have no monthly payment, increasing their \noverall debt and keeping them in debt longer. \n104.  When a borrower applies for IDR, their loans are placed in an initial administrative \nprocessing forbearance for up to 60 days. During this time, their loans continue to accrue interest \nand the months count toward PSLF, even though no payment is due, although these months do not \ncount toward IDR. After this initial 60 day administrative processing forbearance, however, \nborrowers whose IDR applications are still pending are placed in the special SAVE litigation \nforbearance. Months that pass while borrowers are in a SAVE litigation forbearance also do not \ncount toward cancellation under either PSLF or IDR. \n105.  When the Department first announced the SAVE litigation forbearance, it explained \nthat loans in the forbearance would not accrue interest, in recognition of the fact that borrowers’ \nloans were placed into the forbearance due to no fault of their own. In January 2025, the \nDepartment told borrowers, “You will be in this forbearance until servicers are able to accurately \ncalculate monthly payments, which FSA expects servicers to be able to do no earlier than \nSeptember 2025.”5  On July 9, 2025, however, the Department announced that it was changing this \npolicy, and began to charge interest on these loans beginning August 1, 2025. In its press release \nannouncing this change, the Department wrongly stated that it was required to charge interest for \nthese borrowers because of the Eighth Circuit’s order in February, and that the Department lacked \nthe authority to waive interest for these borrowers. This policy change makes the Department’s \nslow processing rate even more harmful for borrowers with pending applications. \n \n5 Email dated Jan. 16, 2025, from U.S. Department of Education to borrowers, “Update on the Saving on a \nValuable Education Plan,” available at https://perma.cc/FS7M-EJG4. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 23 of 37\n \nThe Department Continues to Withhold IDR and PSLF Debt Cancellation \n106.  In addition to depriving borrowers of their right to affordable payment options \nunder IDR by delaying the processing of their applications, the Department is withholding loan \ncancellation from borrowers who qualify to have their loans cancelled under the HEA. \n107.  The IDR plans all provide for debt cancellation after a prescribed period of time, \nranging from 20 to 25 years, or 240 to 300 monthly payments. Both the enjoined and the prior \nregulations stated that the Department would process debt cancellation automatically.6  \n108.  Although the government had provided a tracker to help borrowers follow their \nprogress toward cancellation under IDR, on or around April 27, 2025, the Department removed \nthe progress tracker on borrowers’ StudentAid.gov accounts, making it harder for borrowers to \nknow when they have met the minimum requirements to have their loans cancelled and when the \nDepartment is withholding their cancellation. \n109.  Although a preliminary injunction in the SAVE litigation prohibits the Department \nfrom providing IDR cancellation pursuant to the SAVE plan, nothing is preventing the Department \nfrom cancelling eligible borrowers’ debts through the IBR, ICR, or PAYE plans.  \n110.  Despite this, as of September 2025, on its website in response to the question, “Is \nED processing IDR forgiveness?” the Department’s response is that, “Forgiveness as a feature of \n \n6 The IBR regulations in effect immediately prior to the finalization of the now-enjoined rules further \nelaborate  that  “[w]hen  the  Secretary  determines  that  a  borrower  has  satisfied  the  loan  forgiveness \nrequirements under paragraph (f) of this section on an eligible loan, the Secretary cancels the outstanding \nbalance and accrued interest on that loan. No later than six months prior to the anticipated date that the \nborrower will meet the forgiveness requirements, the Secretary sends the borrower a written notice that \nincludes . . . An explanation that the borrower is approaching the date that he or she is expected to meet the \nrequirements to receive loan forgiveness.” 34 C.F.R. 685.221(f)(5)(i) (as it was in effect on June 30, 2024). \nThe  enjoined  regulations  state,  “The  Secretary  tracks  a  borrower's  progress  toward  eligibility  for \nforgiveness under paragraph (k) of this section and forgives loans that meet the criteria under paragraph (k) \nof this section without the need for an application or documentation from the borrower.” 34 C.F.R. \n685.209(l)(11).   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 24 of 37\n \nthe SAVE, PAYE, and ICR Plans is currently paused, because those plans were not created by \nCongress.” This is false. Although there is pending litigation related to the SAVE plan, there is no \nlawsuit or court order addressing debt cancellation under PAYE or ICR, nor has the Department \namended its regulations, which are still in force and are not affected by the states’ litigation in \nMissouri, and which provide for debt cancellation under both plans. \n111.  The Department’s answer on its website continues by acknowledging that it “can \nand will still process loan forgiveness for the IBR Plan,” but that “. . . [c]urrently, IBR forgiveness \nis paused[.]” \n112.  The Department is therefore refusing to provide lawful debt cancellation under the \nPAYE and ICR plans, and is withholding debt cancellation under IBR, which it concedes is \nrequired by law. \n113.  The Department is similarly withholding loan cancellation for borrowers who have \naccrued at least 120 qualifying payments under the PSLF program necessary for loan cancellation, \nor who have pending Buyback applications that, once reviewed and granted, would result in at \nleast 120 qualifying payments. \n114.  For borrowers who continue to make qualifying payments and have qualifying \nemployment, the Department is not processing their PSLF paperwork to reflect the correct number \nof qualifying months they have accrued toward the 120 months required for PSLF. For borrowers \nwho have met or exceed the necessary 120 months, the Department is withholding their statutory \nright to have their loans cancelled. \n115.  For borrowers who have been stuck in the SAVE litigation forbearance and seek to \nrecuperate that time to count for PSLF using the PSLF Buyback program, the Department is not \nprocessing their Buyback applications. Pursuant to the same court order requiring the Department \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 25 of 37\n \nto provide monthly status updates about its processing of the IDR application backlog, the \nDepartment has provided monthly status updates about the processing of the PSLF Buyback \napplication  backlog.  For  each  month  of  reporting,  the  Department  received  more  Buyback \napplications than it processed. (See ECF Nos. 36-39.) As of July 31, 2025, there are 72,730 pending \nBuyback applications. (ECF No. 39.) From May to July, the Department received an average of \n10,743 new applications, but only processed an average of 2,939. (See ECF Nos. 36-39.) For each \nmonth during which it reported, the Department saw a net increase in the number of pending \nBuyback applications, and so is clearly not making meaningful progress on processing these \nborrowers’ applications. \n116.  Because borrowers can only use the Buyback process to recuperate previously \nineligible months toward PSLF if those months will bring their total qualifying months to 120 \nmonths or greater, making them eligible for cancellation, i.e., those months will give them the time \nrequired to qualify for cancellation, for any eligible borrower with a pending Buyback application, \nthe Department is depriving them of their statutory right to debt cancellation under PSLF. \nThe Department’s Decisions Harm Borrowers, Including AFT, its members, and Named \nPlaintiffs \n \n117.  The Department’s decision to withhold IDR and PSLF benefits is actively harming \nborrowers.  \n118.  Although  the  Department  has  reopened  the  IDR  application  and  commenced \nprocessing  applications,  nearly  1.4  million  applications  are  still  pending.  This  includes \napplications from thousands of eligible public service workers who are stuck in either the SAVE \nforbearance or in plans that are not PSLF-eligible. Until they are enrolled in an IDR plan or, for \nthose who are eligible, have had their loans cancelled under IDR, borrowers are being deprived of \ntheir rights under Congress’s IDR provisions. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 26 of 37\n \n119.  The Department is failing to process eligible borrowers’ PSLF cancellations, or has \nleft borrowers with pending Buyback applications in limbo, as that backlog grows month to month. \n120.  Because of the Department’s actions, thousands of eligible public service workers \nare being denied progress towards the student loan forgiveness to which they are statutorily \nentitled.  \n121.  For  borrowers  who  have  satisfied  statutory  requirements  to  have  their  loans \ncancelled, through either IDR or PSLF, the Department is harming those borrowers by withholding \nthat cancellation.      \n122.  These harms—withholding of affordable payment options that count toward loan \ncancellation and the cancellation of loans that have met all statutory requirements to be cancelled—\nare exacerbated by two upcoming deadlines. \n123.  First, beginning January 1, 2026, the provision of federal tax code that provides \nstudent loan cancellation shall not be considered a taxable event for federal income tax purposes \nwill expire. See 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5). Although some student loan cancellation programs are \nspecifically exempt from federal income taxes, such as PSLF, see 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(1), IDR \ncancellation is not one of them. Therefore, any borrower who is currently eligible to have their \nloans cancelled under an IDR plan, such as IBR, but whose cancellation is being withheld by the \nDepartment, risks this cancellation being taxed as federal income if the cancellation is not \nprocessed before January 1, 2026. \n124.  Second, the resumption of interest accrual for borrowers whose loans are in the \nspecial SAVE litigation forbearance will result in SAVE-enrolled borrowers being charged interest \nthat they otherwise would not be charged if the SAVE provisions were not preliminarily enjoined. \nFor borrowers seeking to enroll in another available IDR plan and whose loans are in the SAVE \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 27 of 37\n \nlitigation forbearance while their IDR application is pending, the Department’s inaction to enroll \nborrowers in another plan exacerbates this harm because it keeps borrowers in the interest-bearing \nforbearance rather than placing them in a plan through which they could make monthly payments. \nAlthough borrowers could make voluntary payments to cover interest, such payments would not \ncount as a qualifying payment for IDR or PSLF purposes and would ultimately increase the total \namount they will pay over the life of their loans. Finally, for borrowers who have satisfied the \nrequirements to have their loans cancelled under the IDR statutes but from whom the Department \nis illegally withholding loan cancellation, accruing interest will increase their account balance and \nwill increase their tax liability if their loan cancellation is not processed before the January 1, 2026 \ntax deadline. \n125.  AFT, and its members, and Named Plaintiffs, are a case in point. Thousands of AFT \nmembers are eligible for each and every one of the statutorily required repayment plans and \ncancellation rights described above. Thousands of AFT members have contractual rights to \nparticipate in each of these statutorily required repayment plans. \n126.  Plaintiff Naugle has dutifully paid her loans for over 25 years, but the Department \nis depriving her of her statutory right to have her loans cancelled through IBR. After years in the \nIBR plan, she switched to the SAVE plan because it offered more affordable monthly payments, \nbut switched back to the IBR plan in order to continue making payments toward cancellation \nthrough IDR, although the IBR plan payments were more expensive. She reached 300 qualifying \npayments in May 2025, but the Department has refused to cancel her loans through IBR. As a \nresult, she has continued to make monthly payments of over $700, for fear of becoming delinquent \nor entering default on her loans. If her loans are not cancelled before January 1, 2026, when her \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 28 of 37\n \nloans are eventually cancelled, she will face federal income tax liability on her discharged loan \namount that she would not have to pay if her loans had been promptly cancelled. \n127.  Plaintiff Whitley, a retiree, borrowed approximately $110,000 in federal student \nloans, which has ballooned to over $750,000. According to a message that he received from \nFederal Student Aid in February 2025, Plaintiff Whitley had 310 qualifying payments toward \ncancellation under IBR. He has accrued additional time since then, putting him well beyond the \n300 qualifying payments necessary to have his loans cancelled through the IBR plan. Because the \nDepartment has refused to process his cancellation, he has had to continue to make monthly \npayments of approximately $105 to avoid becoming delinquent or entering default. If his loans are \nnot cancelled before January 1, 2026, when his loans are eventually cancelled, he will face federal \nincome tax liability on his discharged loan amount that he would not have to pay if his loans had \nbeen promptly cancelled. \n128.  Plaintiff Sandy Cashman, an AFT member, is a retired government worker who has \nover $115,000 in federal student loan debt. She has persistently made payments on her loans for \ndecades, and in July 2025 Federal Student Aid informed her that she was eligible to have her loans \ncancelled  through  IDR.  She  also  confirmed  that  she  had  satisfied  the  qualifying  payment \nrequirements using Federal Student Aid’s online payment calculator tool. The Department still has \nnot cancelled her loans, forcing her to continue making monthly payments of $687. These are \nunaffordable payments for Plaintiff Cashman, but she has continued to pay because of the severe \nconsequences of becoming delinquent or entering default. Due to the Department’s failure to \ncancel her debts as required by federal law, Plaintiff Cashman has at times had to choose between \npaying her student loans and paying for her medical care. If her loans are not cancelled before \nJanuary 1, 2026, when her loans are eventually cancelled, she will face federal income tax liability \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 29 of 37\n \non her discharged loan amount that she would not have to pay if her loans had been promptly \ncancelled. \n129.  Plaintiff  Iverson,  an AFT  member,  works  in  a  medical  testing  lab  and  has \napproximately $250,000 in federal student loan debt. After being advised by Federal Student Aid \nto apply for the IBR plan because she already had 324 qualifying payments that, once enrolled in \nIBR, would qualify her for debt cancellation, in July 2025 she applied for the IBR plan. Upon \ninformation and belief, she was advised to do this because, even though she is also eligible for \ncancellation under the ICR program plans, the Department had stopped cancelling loans under \nthose plans. In August 2025, her application for IBR was denied on the grounds that she did not \nhave a partial financial hardship, although that was not and is still not a requirement for IBR. This \nleft her enrolled in the ICR plan. Because of the Department’s wrongful denial, Plaintiff Iverson \nwill have to continue making payments on a loan that legally should no longer exist. If her loans \nare not cancelled before January 1, 2026, when her loans are eventually cancelled, she will face \nfederal income tax liability on her discharged loan amount that she would not have to pay if her \nloans had been promptly cancelled. \n130.  Plaintiff  Dubreuil,  an AFT  member,  teaches  high  school  Social  Studies  at  a \ntechnical high school. She dedicated herself to public service as a teacher and has taught for over \nten years. She was on track to have most of her loans forgiven in November of 2024, but that \nprogress was halted overnight. In July 2024, her loans, which had been in the SAVE plan, were \nplaced into an administrative forbearance. As previously discussed, her time in this forbearance \ndoes not count toward PSLF. When she was placed in the forbearance, she had 115 of the 120 \nqualifying payments necessary for PSLF. She has also applied three times to have her forbearance \ntime counted through the “Buyback” program, but none of these applications have been processed. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 30 of 37\n \nShe also applied to switch IDR plans, so that she could continue making payments that would \ncount toward PSLF. She applied for the IBR plan in January 2025, but her application was not \nprocessed until July 2025; if the Department had promptly processed her application, she could \nhave accrued her remaining 5 months needed for PSLF by July. Due to an error with her account, \nthe Department has placed her back in a forbearance, and she is still being denied the opportunity \nto have her loans cancelled through PSLF. The stress from this debt, and the sheer tension that it \ncauses on her day to day, is unbearable. Her husband and she have been unable to save for \nretirement or contribute to their daughter’s college savings fund because of this debt. Through no \nfault of her own, Plaintiff Dubreuil is unable to make payments based on her income and to \nprogress toward PSLF forgiveness, and is therefore being deprived her statutory and contractual \nrights. As a result, she still owes and is paying on a debt that should legally no longer exist. \n131.  Plaintiff Wegner is a government employee and has approximately $104,500 in \nfederal student loans. He has consistently made payments on his loans and has never been \ndelinquent or in default. Plaintiff Wegner enrolled in the SAVE plan to make lower monthly \npayments. His records on StudentAid.gov show that he has 113 of the 120 necessary qualifying \npayments for PSLF, and that he was on track to reach 120 payments for his loans by around January \n2025. However, in July 2024, Plaintiff Wegner was placed in the SAVE forbearance, along with \nmillions of other borrowers, at which point he stopped receiving credit toward PSLF. In February \n2025, and then again in July 2025, Plaintiff Wegner submitted PSLF Buyback applications to \nrecoup these months in forbearance for PSLF, which should have been sufficient to qualify him \nfor cancellation. The Department has not processed his applications. He also applied for the IBR \nplan in February 2025, but the Department has not processed his application. If he had been \npromptly enrolled in IBR, he could have made his final 7 qualifying payments by approximately \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 31 of 37\n \nSeptember 2025, as an alternative to getting credit through the Buyback program. The Department \nis therefore withholding Plaintiff Wegner’s statutory right to cancellation through PSLF and to \naccrue more PSLF credit through the IBR plan. As a result, he has been kept in debt longer than \nrequired and will have to make payments on loans that should not longer legally exist, or risk \nbecoming delinquent or entering default. \n132.  The Department’s failure to cancel Named Plaintiffs’ debts harms them in several \nways. They must continue to make payments on loans that should legally no longer exist for fear \nof becoming delinquent or entering default. The loans appear on their credit reports and are a \nmonthly expense that inhibits their abilities to pay for basic necessities and to save for the future.  \n133.  These Named Plaintiffs all have standing in their own right to sue, and their \nexperiences are similar to those that other AFT members face.  \n134.  AFT, however, is vindicating their interests because, as highlighted above, the \nissues are at the heart of AFT’s purpose.  \n135.  No individual member of AFT is a necessary party in this case as the claims and \nrelief sought are challenging an unlawful government policy that is being applied in the same \nmanner as to all individuals.  \n136.  The Department’s unlawful action is also harming AFT as an organization because \nits resources have been, and continue to be, diverted to address the unlawful conduct, which \ndirectly impedes its ability to develop and implement additional financial literacy programs and \nresources that it had planned for its members. It has had to increase its efforts to assist its members \nwith their student loans as a result of the Department’s shut down of the IDR applications. \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 32 of 37\n \n137.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2), Plaintiffs seek certification of the following \nclasses: \nIDR Application Class \nAll borrowers with a pending IDR application. \n \nIDR Denial Class \nAll borrowers who have had their IDR application denied because (1) their \nIBR application was denied after July 4, 2025 due to an asserted lack of a \npartial financial hardship or (2) the borrower elected for the lowest \nmonthly repayment option on the Office of Management & Budget’s form. \n \nIBR Cancellation Class \nAll borrowers who have made the required payments for loan cancellation \nunder the IBR program but have not yet received cancellation. \n \nICR Cancellation Class \nAll borrowers who have made the required payments for loan cancellation \nunder the ICR or PAYE plans but have not yet received cancellation. \n \nPSLF Forgiveness Class \nAll borrowers who have satisfied the public service requirements of PSLF \nbut whose loans have not been forgiven because the Department has not \nprocessed their Buyback applications.     \n \n138.  Numerosity:  The Classes are sufficiently numerous.  There are over a million \npeople with pending IDR applications, hundreds of thousands of people whose IDR applications \nare or will soon be wrongfully denied; and thousands of people who are awaiting for loan \ncancellations, including over 72,000 borrowers with pending Buyback applications. \n139.  Commonality:  There are numerous common questions of law and fact that can be \nanswered with common evidence, including, but not limited to: \na.  Whether the Department’s failure to enroll borrowers in Congressionally required \nIDR plans violates the Administrative Procedure Act; \nb.  Whether  the  Department’s  failure  to  provide  for  statutorily  required  loan \ncancellation through IDR plans violates the Administrative Procedure Act;  \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 33 of 37\n \nc.  Whether  the  Department’s  failure  to  provide  for  statutorily  required  loan \ncancellation through PSLF violates the Administrative Procedure Act; and \nd.  The proper scope of injunctive relief. \n140.  Typicality and Adequacy: Plaintiffs’ claims and injuries are typical of those of the \nClasses. Plaintiffs and their counsel have no conflicts with the Classes and will adequately \nrepresent the Classes. \n141.  Certification is appropriate under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2) because the Department \nhas acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the Classes, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the Classes as a whole. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nUnlawful Withholding of Agency Action in Violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(1) \n142.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n143.  The APA authorizes this Court to “compel agency action” that has been “unlawfully \nwithheld.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n144.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to offer borrowers access to an IBR repayment plan, including processing and \nenrolling borrowers in this plan and cancelling eligible loans pursuant to this plan. \n145.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to offer borrowers access to an ICR-based repayment plan, including processing \nand enrolling borrowers in these plans and cancelling eligible loans pursuant to these plans. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 34 of 37\n \n146.  As  alleged  above,  the  Secretary  has  a  mandatory  statutory,  regulatory,  and \ncontractual duty to cancel the balance of any borrower who has made 120 PSLF-qualifying \npayments, including by processing borrowers’ PSLF Buyback applications. \n147.  Defendants are unlawfully preventing borrowers from accessing the IBR program’s \nfull benefits, including from receiving the benefit of loan cancellation. \n148.  Defendants are unlawfully preventing borrowers from accessing the ICR programs’ \nfull benefits, including from receiving the benefit of loan cancellation. \n149.  Defendants are unlawfully withholding PSLF forgiveness.      \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nArbitrary and Capricious Agency Action in Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act,  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \n150.  Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each of the foregoing allegations as \nif fully set forth herein. \n151.  The APA  prohibits  agency  action  that  is  “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n152.  The Department’s decision to halt loan cancellation under the IBR, PAYE, and ICR \nplans constitutes a final agency action under the APA.  \n153.  Defendants have  acted in  a manner that is  arbitrary, capricious, an abuse  of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law by, among other actions: \na.  The  Department’s  abrupt  and  unjustified  halting  of  IBR,  ICR,  and  PAYE  plans’ \ncancellation is inconsistent with the governing statute and regulation. \nb.  The  Department’s  abrupt  and  unjustified  halting  of  IBR,  ICR,  and  PAYE  plans’ \ncancellation is inconsistent with its contractual obligations. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 35 of 37\n \nc.  The Department’s abrupt and unjustified halting of the IBR, ICR, and PAYE plans is \nnot mandated by the Eighth Circuit’s decision, is without any rational basis, and is \narbitrary and capricious. \nd.  The Department’s hold on PSLF relief is inconsistent with the governing statute and \nregulation. \ne.  The Department’s hold on PSLF relief is inconsistent with its contractual obligations. \nf.  The Department’s hold on PSLF relief is not mandated by the Eighth Circuit’s decision, \nis without any rational basis, and is arbitrary and capricious. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA.  Declare that the Department is unlawfully withholding the IBR and ICR programs’ full \nbenefits, including debt cancellation;  \nB.  Declare that the Department is unlawfully withholding PSLF program in contravention of \nlaw;  \nD.  Certify the Classes under Rule 23(b)(2); \nE.  Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  preventing  the  Department  from \ncollecting from borrowers who are eligible for income-driven repayment until it satisfies \nits statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations under the HEA’s IBR, ICR, and PSLF \nprovisions. \nF.  Issue  preliminary  and  permanent  injunctive  relief  preventing  the  Department  from \ncharging interest on loans that are enrolled in the SAVE plan until the litigation related to \nthat plan is resolved. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 41     Filed 09/09/25     Page 36 of 37\n \nG.  Issue preliminary and permanent injunctive relief compelling the Department to comply \nwith its statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations, by:  \ni.  Complying with the IBR statute by restoring the full IBR plan benefits and granting \nIBR loan cancellation to eligible borrowers before January 1, 2026, and on a rolling \nbasis thereafter; \nii.  Complying with the ICR statute by restoring an ICR and PAYE plan benefits and \ngranting ICR and PAYE loan cancellation to eligible borrowers before January 1, 2026, \nand on a rolling basis thereafter; \niii. Complying with the PSLF statute by restoring public service workers’ ability to obtain \ncredit  toward  PSLF  forgiveness  and  timely  granting  PSLF  forgiveness  to  those \nborrowers, including by processing their PSLF Buyback applications.   \nH.  Award attorneys’ fees as authorized by law; and \nI.  Grant such further relief as may be just and proper. \n \nDate: September 9, 2025        /s/John G.

To resolve the \npending Motion for Preliminary Injunction, ECF Nos. 44 & 49-1, and Motion for Class Certifica-\ntion, ECF No. 45, without the need for intervention from the Court, the Parties have agreed to the \nfollowing, subject to the Court’s approval: \n1.  The Parties respectfully ask the Court to deny without prejudice Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, ECF No. 44 (including its Proposed Order, ECF No. 49-\n1). \n2.  The Parties respectfully ask the Court to deny without prejudice Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Class Certification, ECF No. 45. \n3.  The Parties respectfully ask the Court to stay Defendants’ deadline to answer or \notherwise respond to the First Amended Complaint (and all other applicable dead-\nlines) pending further order of the Court. \n4.  Defendants will continue processing loan cancellations for borrowers who are eli-\ngible for cancellation under the Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 54     Filed 10/17/25     Page 2 of 5\n5.  Defendants will not deny as ineligible any borrower applying for the IBR plan on \nthe ground that the borrower lacks a “partial financial hardship,” as previously de-\nfined by Section 493C(a)(3) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1098e(a)(3) (2024). Defendants will hold such borrowers’ applications in abey-\nance until Defendants update their systems to allow for proper processing of these \napplications. Defendants affirm (and will state on studentaid.gov) that borrowers \nwho applied for the IBR plan on or after July 4, 2025 and were denied on the basis \nthat they lacked a partial financial hardship are invited to reapply. \n6.  Defendants will continue processing loan cancellations for borrowers who are eli-\ngible for cancellation under the Original Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) and \nPay As You Earn (PAYE) plans as long as these plans are in effect. \n7.  Defendants will continue processing applications for Public Service Loan For-\ngiveness (PSLF) Buybacks. \n8.  Defendants agree that for their internal purposes, the date a borrower becomes eli-\ngible to have their loans cancelled under the IBR, Original ICR, or PAYE plans \nconstitutes the effective date of their loan discharge. \na.  Defendants agree to not file an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1099-\nC for a borrower who becomes eligible for discharge in 2025 if the condi-\ntions in IRS Notice 2022-1 are met. \nb.  For avoidance of doubt, Defendants agree that for their internal purposes, \nwhen a borrower (1) has achieved eligibility under the Saving on a Valuable \nEducation (SAVE) plan, (2) applies to transfer to one of the IBR, Original \nICR, or PAYE plans on or before December 31, 2025, and (3) that applica-\ntion is approved on or after January 1, 2026—the date that borrower be-\ncomes eligible for cancellation under the new plan constitutes the effective \ndate of their loan discharge, even if that date falls on or before the date the \nborrower’s application was approved. \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 54     Filed 10/17/25     Page 3 of 5\n9.  Pursuant to the above, Defendants confirm that any borrower who qualifies to have \ntheir loan discharged through an Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plan (which in-\ncludes IBR, Original ICR, and PAYE) will continue to be reimbursed for any pay-\nments made on the loan after the final payment that qualified them for discharge. \n10.  Plaintiffs acknowledge that the IRS and the U.S. Department of the Treasury, and \nnot Defendants, have the final say on whether Defendants’ student loan cancella-\ntions qualify as taxable income under Section 9675(a) of the American Rescue Plan \nAct of 2021, previously codified at 26 U.S.C. § 108(f)(5) (2023). \n11.  Defendants will file six status reports that provide public information about certain \ntopics raised in this litigation. Defendants’ first status report shall be due 30 days \nafter the current lapse in federal government appropriations ends, and subsequent \nstatus reports will be due every 30 days thereafter. \n12.  After the filing of the sixth status report, the Parties will confer about the need for \nfurther reporting, and (if necessary) will inform the Court of their positions on \nwhether further reporting is necessary. \n13.  Each status report will include the following information about the last full calendar \nmonth preceding the date of the report (i.e., a status report due on November 15, \n2025 will provide information about October 1 to October 30): \na.  The number of IDR plan applications that were received during the preced-\ning month. \nb.  The number of IDR plan applications that were pending at the end of the \npreceding month. \nc.  The number of IDR plan applications that were decided during the preced-\ning month. If possible, that number should be broken down by whether the \napplication was approved or denied. \nd.  The number of borrowers whose loans were discharged under an IDR plan \nduring the preceding month. If possible, that number should be broken \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 54     Filed 10/17/25     Page 4 of 5\ndown by whether the discharge was pursuant to the IBR, Original ICR, or \nPAYE plans. \ne.  The number of PSLF Buyback applications that were received during the \npreceding month. \nf.  The number of PSLF Buyback applications that were pending at the end of \nthe preceding month. \ng.  The number of PSLF Buyback applications that were decided (that is, for \nwhich Defendants have completed processing) during the preceding month, \nbroken down by the number that were approved versus denied. \nh.  The number of borrowers whose loans were discharged under PSLF during \nthe preceding month.  \n14.  In Defendants’ first status report, Defendants will explain the method that the De-\npartment of Education uses to identify borrowers whose loans are eligible for dis-\ncharge through the IDR plans. \n15.  In Defendants’ first status report, Defendants will provide the number of borrowers \nwhose applications for the IBR plan were denied on or after July 4, 2025, on the \nground that the borrower lacked a partial financial hardship. \nBy agreeing to the foregoing, Defendants do not stipulate to or concede any factual or legal \nallegations that have been raised or could have been raised in this proceeding, including but not \nlimited to any findings the Court would be required to make before granting injunctive relief. \nThe Parties respectfully request that the foregoing agreement be adopted by order of the \nCourt. \n   \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 54     Filed 10/17/25     Page 5 of 5\nDated:  October 17, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n BRETT A.

INTRODUCTION \nCongress designed the federal student loan system to “increase educational opportunities” \nand to help students access the “benefits of postsecondary education,” “without financial barriers.” \nBiden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 483–84 (2023); 20 U.S.C. § 1221-1. As part of this effort, it \ncreated, in 1994, a federal Direct Loan program that provided the defendants authority to lend \nmoney directly to students. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1087a, et seq. The result: the federal Government \ntoday is the largest creditor of student loans, with approximately 43 million borrowers and $1.6 \ntrillion in outstanding debt.1 This case is about the income-driven repayment programs that \nCongress created to benefit these borrowers and the Department of Education’s and Secretary of \nEducation Linda McMahon’s (collectively “the defendants”) unlawful failure to carry out these \nprograms.   \nCongress requires the defendants to provide student loan borrowers with repayment plans \nthat tie student’s monthly  payment to  their incomes. These plans are  called income-driven \nrepayment or “IDR.” The defendants, through regulations and contracts with every single student \nloan borrower, guarantee borrowers access to these programs. Congress delegated these duties \nspecifically to the defendants, and they may not be ignored, or fobbed off on other departments or \nagencies without Congress changing the authorizing statutes. \nNonetheless, without Congressional authorization, the defendants have inexplicably and \nirrationally issued a Stop Work order shutting down all access to all income-driven repayment \nplans for borrowers seeking to enroll. Millions of student loan borrowers are being denied \nCongressionally mandated student loan repayment and forgiveness programs, simply because the \ndefendants have unlawfully ceased to accept and process enrollment applications.  \n \n1 A Snapshot of Federal Student Loans, Cong. Res. Servs. (last updated Feb. 19, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF10158. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 9 of 50\n \nAfter this lawsuit was filed, the defendants could have restarted income-driven repayment \nplans. Instead, they went to the press and said that an income-driven repayment plan application \nform might “be available as soon as next week.”2 The very next day, President Trump signed an \nExecutive Order directing the defendants to close the Department of Education. And, the next day, \nthe President issued a statement to reporters declaring that the responsibilities that Congress \nspecifically delegated to the Department of Education and the Secretary will instead be handed to \nthe Small Business Administration (SBA).3 In other words, the defendants have not made any firm \ncommitments on when—if ever—income-driven repayment program applications will again be \nlive.    Nor  have  they  addressed  when—if  ever—they  will  process  those  applications.    The \nPresident’s Executive Order casts doubt on the defendants’ out-of-court representations and \nstrongly  suggests that the already-weeks long withholding  of these rights  will be extended \nindefinitely. And even if the defendants’ actions were consistent with their Congressional authority \n(and they are not),4 as a practical matter, the Small Business Administration is unlikely to be \ncapable of assuming these responsibilities in a reasonable time frame.  All of this underscores, the \nurgent need for judicial intervention to protect borrowers’ interests.   \n  Plaintiff American Federation of Teachers, along with many of its 1.8 million members, \nare harmed by this misconduct. Many members—who work critical jobs in education, healthcare, \nand in federal, state, and local government roles—are burdened with high levels of student debt \nbut cannot access an affordable, statutorily-mandated repayment plan. Many are facing the choice \nof paying their student loan bills or putting food on their table. An imminent threat of bankruptcy \n \n2 Lexi Lonas Cochran, AFT sues Education Department over removal of IDR student loan applications, The Hill \n(Mar. 19, 2025). \n \n3 Lexi Lonas Cochran, Trump says student loans moving to SBA, ‘special needs’ to HHS, The Hill (March 21, 2025) \n4 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b).  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 10 of 50\n \nhangs over their heads. Further, while 75 percent of them work in roles that are eligible for public \nservice loan forgiveness, these individuals now lack access to plans that would allow them to earn \ncredit towards that forgiveness. To put it simply: these members are stuck in a devastating limbo. \nAnd for its part, the plaintiff is diverting its limited resources to attempt to help guide them through \nit.  \n  Ultimately, the defendants are ignoring their legal obligations at the expense of working-\nclass Americans like the plaintiff’s members. The plaintiff therefore filed this action to ensure \naccess to these programs, on which its members rely every day. The plaintiff seeks emergency \nrelief to return to the status quo ante—a period where its members had access to income-driven \nrepayment plans. Alternatively, the plaintiff asks the Court to order the defendants to halt all \ncollections on borrowers  and ensure that this time can count  towards Public Service Loan \nForgiveness until the defendants can satisfy its income-driven repayment plan obligations again.  \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Congress requires the defendants (and only the defendants) to create and \nprovide borrowers access to income-driven repayment plans. \n  As part of the federal student loan program, Congress enacted two separate, but related \nprovisions requiring the Secretary of Education to offer repayment options that tie a borrower’s \nmonthly payment to their income. Each payment plan has different characteristics that vary \nmeaningfully with respect to the calculation of monthly payments, the length of the repayment \nterm (and if/when the loans are forgiven after a certain amount of time in repayment), and the \namount of discretionary income that factors into the equation.  The plans created by these statutes \nare broadly referred to as income-driven repayment plans or IDR.  \n  First, since 2007, Congress has required the Secretary to offer to federal student loan \nborrowers  “Income-Based  Repayment”  options.  20  U.S.C.  §  1098e.  Congress  directed:  the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 11 of 50\n \n“Secretary shall carry out a program under which a borrower . . . who has a partial financial \nhardship . . . may elect, during any period the borrower has the partial financial hardship, to have \nthe borrower’s aggregate monthly payment for all such loans not exceed” the figure set out in a \npayment formula set by statute. 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b). This statute assigns this duty to the Secretary \nof the Department of Education, not the Small Business Administration or any other entity. Using \nthis statute, the Department of Education created a plan called the Income-Based Repayment Plan \n(IBR). 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a).   \n  Separately, Congress, since 1994, has also required the Secretary of the Department of \nEducation (and not some other secretary, agency, or department) to offer at least one Income-\nContingent Repayment Plan (ICR). The Income Contingent Repayment Plan statute mandates that \n“the Secretary shall offer a borrower of a loan . . . an income contingent repayment plan, with \nvarying  annual  repayment  amounts  based  on  the  income  of  the  borrower.”  20  U.S.C. \n§ 1087e(d)(1)(D). Using this statute, the Secretary created three plans: the Income-Contingent \nRepayment Plan (ICR Plan), the Pay As You Earn Plan (PAYE Plan), and the Revised Pay As \nYour Earn Plan (REPAYE Plan, later, as described below, renamed the Saving on a Valuable \nEducation or SAVE Plan). 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(a). \n  In addition to these statutory and regulatory provisions, Congress instructed the Secretary \nof the Department of Education to ground borrowers’ obligations and rights in contract. See 20 \nU.S.C. § 1082(m)(1)(D). The Department of Education, in turn, developed a Master Promissory \nNote that expressly provides that student loan borrowers may apply to repay  their loans under one \nof these different income-driven repayment plans. Indeed, the contract includes an entire section \ndescribing the different plans, and states that “[u]nder an income-driven repayment plan, your \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 12 of 50\n \nrequired monthly payment amount is based on your income and family size, instead of being based \non your loan debt, interest rate, and repayment period, as under a traditional repayment plan.”5  \nB.  Congress creates the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.  \nIn  addition  to  providing  borrowers  with  access  to  income-driven  repayment  plans, \nCongress  also  required  the  Secretary  to  discharge  a  borrower's  student  debt  in  certain \ncircumstances. Most notably, federal law provides loan cancellation for public service workers \nwho have worked for ten years in eligible public service jobs while making eligible payments on \ntheir loans. See 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1).  \n  The statute states: that the Secretary of Education “shall cancel the balance of interest and \nprincipal due . . . on any eligible Federal Direct Loan” for a borrower who “has made 120” \n“monthly payments on the eligible Federal Direct Loan after October 1, 2007” and “has been \nemployed in a public service job during the period in which the borrower ma[de] each of the 120 \npayments.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(m)(1)(A) & (B).  \n  To be eligible for Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a borrower must be enrolled in a \nstandard repayment plan (in which case the borrower pays the entire debt off over a period of ten \nyears), or one of the income-driven repayment plans. Because a Public Service Loan Forgiveness \nborrower would never benefit from Public Service Loan Forgiveness if they were in the ten-year \nstandard repayment plan (since they would pay off the entirety of the loan over the 10-year period), \nand public-service salaries are generally lower than private sector counterparts, Public Service \nLoan Forgiveness borrowers typically enroll in one of the income-driven repayment plans. Notably \nthe ten-year standard plan is not available to borrowers who consolidated their loans—i.e., taking \nout a new federal student loan to refinance and combine one or several existing federal student \n \n5 Master Promissory Note (MPN), at 10 (available at \nhttps://studentaid.gov/sites/default/files/Sub_Unsub_MPN_508-en-us.pdf, attached hereto as Exhibit 1. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 13 of 50\n \nloans—and for these borrowers income-driven repayment plans are the only eligible repayment \nplans.      \n  The  Secretary  has  issued  implementing  regulations  for  the  Public  Service  Loan \nForgiveness statute that further requires the Secretary to provide loan discharges to borrowers who \nhave satisfied the eligibility criteria. Just as with income-driven repayment plans, the borrowers’ \ninitial master promissory note informs them of their Public Service Repayment Plan rights: “Under \nthis program, we will forgive the remaining balance due on your Direct Loans after you have made \n120 payments (after October 1, 2007) on those loans under certain repayment plans while you are \nemployed full-time by a qualifying employer.”6   \nC.  The Biden Administration attempts to revise the income-contingent \nrepayment plans and litigation ensues. \nIncome-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness have served as \ncritical  lifelines to  student loan borrowers.  The income-driven  repayment plans ensure that \nborrowers can repay their loans in amounts they can afford and thus avoid the negative and punitive \nimpacts of a default (such as wage garnishment, tax offset, and negative credit reporting). \nSimilarly, Public Service Loan Forgiveness allows students to serve their communities without \nfear of being unable to pay back their student loan debt. But these programs have not been without \ntheir flaws, and so the prior Administration took steps to reform both programs. See Mackinac Ctr. \nfor Pub. Pol’y v. Cardona, 102 F.4th 343, 347–49 (6th Cir. 2024) (discussing history with these \nprograms). \nRelevant here, on July 10, 2023, the Department of Education issued a final rule to improve \nits  income-contingent  repayment  program—specifically  the  REPAYE  Plan.  See  Improving \nIncome Driven Repayment for the William D. Ford Fed. Direct Loan Program and the Fed. Family \n \n6 Master Promissory Note (MPN), supra at 13. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 14 of 50\n \nEd. Loan (FFEL) Program, 88 Fed. Reg. 43820 (July 10, 2023). In the rule, the Department \nrenamed the REPAYE Plan to the “SAVE” Plan, and made a number of changes to the program \nto make it the best option for the bulk of student loan borrowers. These changes included lowering \na borrower’s monthly payment amount to account for the skyrocketing costs of education and \nshortening, for some borrowers, the period of time that borrowers would remain in the plan before \ntheir loans were forgiven was shortened. The Department also wanted to simplify borrowers’ \noptions, and so it sunsetted enrollment in the other two income-contingent repayment plans (the \nICR Plan and PAYE Plan); as long as at least one income-contingent repayment plan was available, \nthe Department remained compliant with the statute’s mandate. It kept the IBR Plan in place given \nthe statutory requirement for at least one income-based repayment plan.  \n  Certain provisions of the Rule were designated for early implementation and went into \neffect in 2023. See 34 C.F.R. §§ 682, 685.  As a result, millions of student loan borrowers, \nincluding thousands of public service workers, enrolled in the SAVE Plan in 2023 and the first \nhalf of 2024. But, as borrowers began receiving the benefits of this plan, in April 2024, a group of \nstates sued the Department in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. \nThe lawsuit focused on SAVE; it did not challenge the other income-contingent repayment plans \n(the ICR Plan and the PAYE Plan), nor did it focus on the IBR Plan.  \n  The district court entered an injunction blocking the loan forgiveness aspect of the SAVE \nPlan, and then the case went on appeal to the Eighth Circuit. See Missouri v. Biden, 738 F. Supp. \n3d 1113, 1123 (E.D. Mo. 2024); Missouri v. Trump, 128 F.4th 979, 985 (8th Cir. 2025). On \nFebruary 18, 2025, the Eighth Circuit found that the forgiveness provisions of the SAVE Plan were \nlikely invalid. 128 F.4th at 991–96.  Because, in the Eighth Circuit’s view, the provisions were \ninterconnected with the rest of the rule, the court expanded the injunction to all aspects of the \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 15 of 50\n \nSAVE Plan. Id. at 997–98.  The Eighth Circuit also opined on the forgiveness provisions of the \npre-2023 version of the REPAYE Plan, concluding that the forgiveness provisions of the prior \nREPAYE Plan were likely invalid.  Id.   \n  The Eighth Circuit decision did not speak to the rest of the pre-2023 REPAYE Plan, the \nincome-based repayment statute and IBR Plan, or Public Service Loan Forgiveness, nor did it \npreclude the defendants from utilizing them in the future. In fact, it used the existence of \nforgiveness through Public Service Loan Forgiveness and the IBR statute to reach its decision, \nsaying “if Congress had given [the forgiveness] power through ICR, creating IBR and requiring \nlow-income borrowers to make payments for twenty or twenty-five years to obtain forgiveness \n[through that plan] would have been unnecessary. The separate program for loan forgiveness in \nten years for public service employees would similarly be superfluous.” 128 F.4th at 995. \n  As that litigation moved forward in 2024, the Biden Administration took steps to fulfill its \nlegal obligation to provide borrowers with access to income-driven repayment plans.7 From July \nto October 2024, the Department ensured borrowers could apply for the IBR Plan using a paper or \nPDF application form, and on October 2, 2024, the Department of Education re-opened its online \napplication to apply to the IBR Plan. Then on November 15, 2024, the Department of Education \nissued an Interim Final Rule to ensure that it complied “with our statutory duty…to provide \nborrowers with an income contingent repayment plan option.” Income Contingent Repayment Plan \nOption, 89 Fed. Reg. 90221, 901224 (Nov. 15, 2024). Under this rule, the Department reversed its \nsunsetting of the ICR and PAYE Plans, allowing borrowers to enroll in these plans until July 1, \n2027, thereby ensuring that borrowers had access to a plan under the income-contingent repayment \n \n7 On July 19, 2024, the day after the Eighth Circuit granted an emergency stay, the Department placed all borrowers \nwho had been making payments in the SAVE plan into a forbearance. The Department does not count months \nduring this forbearance as months of eligible payment for PSLF purposes. \n \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 16 of 50\n \nstatute. Id.  The rule became final on January 15, 2025. See Income-Contingent Repayment Plan \nOptions, 90 Fed. Reg. 3695 (Jan. 15, 2025).  \nD.  The Trump Administration shuts down access to all income-driven repayment \nplans, orders closure of the Department of Education, and declares that the \nSmall Business Administration will handle student loans. \nAs of 11:59 a.m. on January 20, 2025, borrowers could enroll in plans under both the \nincome-based repayment and income-contingent repayment statutes. However, this soon changed.  \n  On February 26, 2025, the defendants issued a Stop Work Order, directing all loan servicers \nto stop accepting and processing income-driven repayment applications.8 The Stop Work Order \nshuts down all income-driven repayment options for at least three months, but did not specify \nwhen, if ever, they will be reinstated. The defendants’ action applies to all online and paper \napplications.  \nThe defendants’ public notice on its website confirms this decision. It says: \n \nDeclaration of Sarah Tammelleo (“Tammelleo Decl.”), Ex. A.  \n  The plaintiff commenced this litigation on March 18, 2025.

The order directs The defendants to “take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure \nof the Department of Education[.]” Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, \nStates, and Communities, Exec. Order § 2(a) (Mar. 20, 2025).10  \n  One day later, on March 21, 2025, the President changed course from the Executive Order \nsigned the day before: \nPresident Trump said Friday he is “immediately” moving the handling of federal \nstudent loans to the Small Business Administration (SBA), . . . as his White House \nseeks to wind down and eventually eliminate the Education Department. \n \n“I’ve decided that the SBA, the Small Business Administration, headed by Kelly \nLoeffler, will handle all of the student loan portfolio,” Trump told reporters in the \nOval Office, noting it is a “pretty complicated deal, and that’s coming out of the \nDepartment of Education immediately.”11 \n \nThe Administration has not provided further details publicly about how it will handle the move \nof student loans from the Department of Education to the Small Business Administration would \nbe administered, or about how to ensure access to programs, like income-driven repayment and \n \n9 Lexi Lonas Cochran, AFT sues Education Department over removal of IDR student loan applications, The Hill \n(Mar. 19, 2025); Rebecca Carballo, Teachers union sues Education Department for blocking access to repayment \nplans, PoliticoPro (Mar. 19, 2025). \n \n10 Available at https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-\nempowering-parents-states-and-communities/ \n11 Lexi Lonas Cochran, Trump says student loans moving to SBA, ‘special needs’ to HHS, The Hill (March 21, \n2025) \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 18 of 50\n \nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness, that the Department of Education is required by Congress to \noffer.   \nE.  The defendants’ failure to offer income-driven repayment plans harms the \nplaintiff and its members. \nBecause the defendants ordered servicers to stop accepting and processing income-driven \nrepayment plan applications, and because they placed all SAVE Plan borrowers into forbearances, \nonly borrowers who were already in the IBR, ICR, or PAYE Plans can continue making payments \nas Congress intended. If they are not already in an income-driven repayment plan, they cannot get \ninto an income-driven repayment plan. If they are in default, they cannot get out of default and \ninto an income-driven repayment plan. And, if they are working in public service, they are unable \nto get into an affordable repayment option that allows them to earn credit towards forgiveness.  \nThe plaintiff, and its members, are harmed by this conduct. The plaintiff’s mission is to \npromote  fairness,  democracy,  economic  opportunity,  and  high-quality  public  education, \nhealthcare, and public services for students, their families and communities. Tammelleo Decl. ¶ 4. \nIt does this by ensuring its members receive fair pay and benefits for their critical work, and by \nfighting for safe working conditions that also benefit students, patients, and those who use public \nservices. Id. Helping children and students, and ensuring the economic security of its members and \ntheir families, are at the core of this mission. Id. The plaintiff’s mission requires it to provide its \nmembers with assistance and accurate information on student loan repayment and Public Service \nLoan Forgiveness—which is made all the more difficult by the defendants’ misconduct, as well as \nthe Trump Administration’s firing of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Student Loan \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 19 of 50\n \nOmbudsman12 and the firing of nearly all of the staff at Federal Student Aid dedicated to resolving \nstudent loan borrower complaints.13 \nAccording to a survey of the plaintiff’s members, 8 in 10 say student debt is a “major \nburden,” and it is a major driver of financial difficulties as compared to any other debt.14 The \nresult: 78% of these members report that they or someone in their household has previously fallen \nbehind on making debt payments, and one in three had debts go into default. Id. \nGiven this, the plaintiff must divert its resources to address the defendants’ decision to stop \nborrowers from accessing income-driven repayment plans. The plaintiff has spent, and continues \nto spend, tens of thousands of dollars on debt clinics to educate members on how to better navigate \ntheir repayment options, and it has diverted valuable staff time that would otherwise have been \nspent focused on issues like collective bargaining; retirement security; healthcare; student learning \nconditions; and working conditions for educators, public employees and healthcare workers. \nTammelleo Decl. ¶¶ 13, 22-24. Since the defendants shut down access to all income-driven \nrepayment plans, the plaintiff’s staff have had to redraft clinic curriculum and have diverted \nsignificant additional staff time to answering member questions. Id.  ¶ 23. And, while the plaintiff \ncommitted to expanding economic security programs for members and was developing a new \nfinancial literacy clinic curriculum to help members, this program development has been delayed \nand impeded due to the defendants’ actions and the new demand from members with student debt. \nId. ¶ 25. \n \n12 Katherine Knott, Student Loan Watchdog on the Chopping Block, Inside Higher Ed (Feb. 18, 2025), \nhttps://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2025/02/18/cfpbs-student-loan-watchdog-chopping-block. \n \n13 Michael C.

One member, Rachel Dubreuil, \nteaches Social Studies at a technical high school. Declaration of Rachel Dubreuil (“Dubreuil \nDecl.”) ¶ 5. She dedicated herself to public service as a teacher and has taught for over ten years. \nId. Rachel was on track to have most of her loans forgiven under Public Service Loan Forgiveness \nin November 2024, but that progress was halted overnight, just a few months short of resolution. \nId. ¶¶ 6–10. In July 2024, her loans, which had been in the SAVE Plan, were placed into an \nadministrative forbearance. Id. ¶ 11. As previously discussed, her time in this forbearance does not \ncount toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness. She has applied to switch plans, id. ¶ 14, and to \nhave her forbearance time counted though a special program known as the “Buy Back” program,15 \nid.  ¶ 12, but neither of these applications has been processed, id. ¶¶ 12, 14. The stress from this \ndebt, and the sheer tension that it causes her day to day, is unbearable. Because of her student loan \ndebt, she and her husband have not been able to save for retirement, nor have they been able to \nmake contributions to their daughter’s college savings fund. Id. ¶ 16. They have looked into \nobtaining higher life insurance policies as a benefit for their daughter, in case anything were to \nhappen to them, but could not afford those policies due to Rachel’s loans. Id. Not only is Rachel \nbeing deprived of her statutory and contractual rights, but as a result, she will be stuck in her debt \nfor longer and is deprived of the opportunity to plan for her family’s future. \nDr. Picolya McCall-Robinson incurred student loan debt at each step of her education \nleading to her doctorate. Declaration of Picolya McCall-Robinson (“McCall-Robinson Decl.”) ¶¶ \n3-5. As an adjunct professor, she relies on income-driven repayments plans to make her monthly \n \n15 The “Buy Back” program allows qualifying borrowers who were temporarily not making payments because they \nwere in an ineligible deferment or their loan was in forbearance to retroactively pay for months while such deferment \nor forbearance in order to meet the 120 month requirement of the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.  34 C.F.R. \n§  685.219(g)(6);  https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/public-service/public-service-loan-\nforgiveness-buyback.   \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 21 of 50\n \nloan payments, and on Public Service Loan Forgiveness as a long-term plan for her loans. Id. ¶¶ 6-\n8. Despite years of making consistent payments, her current balance is over $580,000, making any \npayments other than income-driven repayment plan payments unaffordable. Id. at ¶ 9. She should \nhave qualified for debt forgiveness in November 2024, but she has not been able to accrue the final \nmonths of payments on an income-driven repayment plan that she needs since her loans were put \nin the SAVE Plan forbearance in July 2024. Id. ¶ 13. She tried in December 2024 to switch income-\ndriven repayment plans, but her application was never processed; she tried again in February 2025, \nbut was unable to submit the application. Id. ¶ 14. As a single mother of two, if her debt forgiveness \nis delayed, it will prevent her from building a life for her children. Id. ¶ 18. Her debt has already \ninhibited her ability to buy a home and to secure a job. Id. ¶¶ 16-17. \nAnd, yet another member, Corey Mason, was already struggling and sacrificing to afford \nher loans, and now feels that her financial future is uncertain. She has 11 years of teaching \nexperience and a bachelor’s degree in education, a master’s degree in Teaching English to \nSpeakers of Other Languages, and a Sixth-Year certificate in reading. Declaration of Corey Mason \n(“Mason Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-4. She currently owes $78,476.89 in federal student loans, $75,926.52 of \nwhich is principal, despite having consistently made payments. Id. ¶ 5. She has already paid off \nher private student loan. Id. ¶ 6. Living on a teacher’s salary, Corey relies on access to income-\ndriven repayment plans to make her monthly payments affordable, id. ¶ 7, and relies on the Public \nService Loan Forgiveness program and the promise of debt forgiveness in planning her life, id. ¶ \n8. Corey has 117 of the 120 months she needs to have her loans forgiven under Public Service \nLoan Forgiveness, and her loans should have been forgiven in August 2024, but she has been stuck \nin the SAVE Plan forbearance since June 2024. Id. ¶ 12. She has been proactive in trying to remove \nher loans from the forbearance and to receive credit for past monthly payments. Id. ¶¶ 13-14 She \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 22 of 50\n \nhas continued to make payments, but she is still stuck in limbo. Id. She was told by her loan servicer \nthat her payment would be $900 per month, up from her income-driven repayment plan payment \nof $364 per month.  Id. ¶ 15. She cannot afford payments of $900 per month. Id. She has already \nspent years struggling with her loans. At times she has forgone heating her home and has accrued \ncredit card debt to cover household expenses in order to remain current on her student loans. Id. ¶ \n16. She spent her existing savings on paying off her private student loan, cannot afford to save \nmore while still paying her federal student loans, and cannot afford a new car. Id. Corey is \nconcerned about planning for her future. She is worried about her job security in light of the efforts \nto close the U.S. Department of Education and about her retirement if the Social Security system \nends. Id. ¶ 17. She is engaged and was waiting for her student loans to be forgiven before getting \nmarried, which she had expected would happen in August 2024 but which now is uncertain. Id. ¶ \n18. Corey has started to consider bankruptcy as a way to manage her unaffordable debt, if she \ncannot access income-driven repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness. Id. ¶ 19. \nThe plaintiff has had contact with other individual members who, since the defendants \nended access to income-driven repayment plans, are considering bankruptcy, Tammelleo Decl. ¶ \n18, cannot save for and afford childcare, id. ¶ 19, plan to retire but currently has student loan \npayments that are greater than their mortgage payments, id. ¶ 20, and cannot meet their children’s \nbasic needs without income driven repayment and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, id.  ¶ 21.  \nThe ongoing harm also extends beyond the plaintiff’s members.  For instance, Dr. Carly \nBaetz was enrolled in the SAVE Plan and is currently stuck in forbearance.  Declaration of Dr. \nCarly Baetz (“Baetz Decl.) ¶¶ 8-9.  She has been enrolled in Public Service Loan Forgiveness and \nwas scheduled to have all of her loans forgiven this fall, but due to the forbearance and inability to \nchange plans, it is unknown when she will be able to have her loans forgiven and the crushing \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 23 of 50\n \nweight on her student loans debt off her back.  Id. ¶¶ 10-16.  Similarly, Tammy Sabens, a former \nnurse who had to retire early for health reasons, has an income of only $1,486 per month, consisting \nentirely of social security. Declaration of Tammy Sabens (“Sabens Decl.”) ¶¶ 3-9.) She is unable \nto access any income-driven repayment programs to lower her monthly student loan payments \nfrom $390.65 per month, and as a result loses sleep, has panic attacks, and feels like her only \noption to is default on her loans.  Id. ¶¶ 10-16.    \nF.  DISCUSSION \na.  The plaintiff has Article III standing. \nAs a preliminary matter, the plaintiff has Article III standing to bring this case on two \nindependent grounds. First, the plaintiff has associational standing as a representative of its \nmembers. As discussed above, its members are harmed by the defendants’ actions and would have \nstanding to sue in their own right, the issue is at the heart of plaintiff’s mission, and no individual \nparticipation is needed in the suit since it is a case challenging an unlawful government policy \nwhere the remedy would be broadly applicable to its members. See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple \nAdvert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977) (providing three elements for associational standing); \nTanner-Brown v. Haaland, 105 F.4th 437, 447 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (citing Hunt elements). Second, \nthe plaintiff has organizational standing on its own behalf because the defendants’ actions, as \ndescribed above, have impeded its activities and caused the plaintiff to spend its resources on \nassisting its members in order to meet its mission; the plaintiff has thereby suffered a concrete and \ndemonstrable injury to its activities. Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 919 (D.C. \nCir. 2015) (discussing standard for organizational standing). \nb.  Immediate injunctive relief is appropriate.   \nWhen seeking a temporary restraining order or a preliminary injunction, the moving party \nmust show: “1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 24 of 50\n \ninjury if the injunction were not granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other \ninterested parties, and (4) that the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.” Chaplaincy \nof  Full  Gospel  Churches  v.  England,  454  F.3d  290,  297  (D.C.  Cir.  2006).  “These  four \nconsiderations are factors, not elements.” Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, \nNo. 25-cv-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 597959, at *12 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025).  \nA temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is appropriate here.  First, the \nplaintiff is likely to succeed on their two Administrative Procedure Act claims – the defendants \nhave a non-discretionary and a non-transferrable duty to offer income-driven repayment plans but \nabruptly stopped offering such plans. The defendants also lack any legal or rational basis to shut \ndown every such plan. Second, the plaintiff, on its own and as a representative of its members, \nfaces ongoing irreparable harm. Some members must choose between basic necessities and paying \ntheir loans, while others are considering bankruptcy, and still others are unable to plan for their \nfuture after relying on eventual debt forgiveness under Public Service Loan Forgiveness.  The \nplaintiff will be forced to dedicate unrecoverable amounts of resources to assist borrowers during \nthis confusing time, resources that were intended to be used for new programs that are now \npostponed. Third, it is never in the public interest for the Government to violate the law in this \nway, particularly when it comes as part of a broader campaign to dismantle a Congressionally \ncreated agency and program.  \n1.  Plaintiff is likely to succeed on its claims because the defendants are \nfailing to meet their statutory and contractual obligations. \nPlaintiff asserts two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act in this case: (1) that \ndefendants are unlawfully withholding access to income-driven repayments plans in contravention \nof legal mandates; and (2) that the defendants’ decision to shut off access to all income-driven \nrepayment plans in this way—and then delegate duties assigned specifically to it by Congress—is \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 25 of 50\n \ncontrary to law and arbitrary and capricious. The plaintiff, as described below, is likely to succeed \non both claims. \na.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act, this Court is likely to \ncompel the Agency to offer an income-driven repayment plan under \n§ 706(1). \n \nSection 706(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act states that courts “shall compel agency \naction unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1). A plaintiff suing under § \n706(1) must show two things: first that the agency has a “ministerial or non-discretionary’ duty \namounting to a ‘specific unequivocal command;” Anglers Conservation Network v. Pritzker, 809 \nF.3d 664, 670 (D.C. Cir. 2016), and second that the agency “failed to take” that discrete agency \naction, Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 63 (2004).  \n  Here, there is no serious question as to either element. First, the defendants (and the \ndefendants specifically, not the Small Business Administration or any other governmental or \nprivate entity) have a statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligation to provide access to plans \nunder both the IBR and ICR statutes. Specifically: \n●  Statutory.  Congress  has said  that the Secretary “shall” “carry out  a program” for \nborrowers to “elect, during any period the borrower has the partial financial hardship,” an \nIBR Plan. 20 U.S.C. 1098e(b). Similarly, Congress stated that the Secretary “shall offer a \nborrower of a loan . . . an income contingent repayment plan.” 20 U.S.C. § 1087e(d)(1)(D). \nBy using “shall,” language, Congress sought “to impose discretionless obligations[.]” \nLopez v. Davis, 531 U.S. 230, 241 (2001); Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 112 (2012) (“The traditional, commonly repeated \nrule is that shall is mandatory and may is permissive . . . .”)  \n \n●  Regulatory. The defendants have also imposed this duty on themselves through their \nimplementing regulations. In addition to its rules that broadly describe the plans, the \nincome-driven  repayment  program  regulations  require,  “[a]fter  the  Secretary  obtains \nsufficient information to calculate the monthly payment amount,” the Secretary must \n“calculate[] the borrower’s payment and establishes the 12-month period during which the \nborrower will be obligated to make a payment in that amount.” 34 C.F.R. § 685.209(l)(4). \nThe  regulations  then  mandates  that  the  Secretary  send  the  borrower  a  “repayment \ndisclosure.”  Id.  §  685.209(l)(4).    In  other  words,  the    defendants’  own  regulations \nincorporate this statutory duty to provide borrowers with access to these plans. See Ctr. for \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 26 of 50\n \nBiological Diversity v. Zinke, 260 F. Supp. 3d 11, 21 (D.D.C. 2017) (“[T]he ‘law’ that \ngenerates a mandatory duty need not be a statute – it can also be an “agency regulation[] \nthat has the force of law”) (citations omitted). \n \n●  Contract.  As  noted  above,  Congress  directed  the  defendants  to  develop  a  master \npromissory note that identifies borrowers’ obligations and rights. the defendants have done \nso, and every federal student loan borrower has signed such a contract. The Borrowers \nmaster promissory notes specifically tells them that they have access to “an income-driven \nrepayment plan,” in which “your required monthly payment amount is based on your \nincome and family size.”  See Ex. 1 attached hereto. \n \nThe defendants have confirmed this mandatory duty. They have said they could not \n“sunset” the IBR Plan because doing so was not “permitted by section 493C(b) of the [Higher \nEducation Act] which authorized the IBR plan.” 88 Fed. Reg. 43,820, 43,837 (July 10, 2023). \nRelatedly,  the  defendants  have  acknowledged  their  “statutory  obligation  under  the  [Higher \nEducation Act] to offer borrowers an income-contingent repayment plan.” Income-Contingent \nRepayment Plan Options, 90 Fed. Reg. 3695, 3696 (Jan. 15, 2025). Any argument to the contrary \nnow would flout the defendants’ prior, consistent position.  \n  Second, the defendants have breached their legal obligation by shutting off all access to \nincome-driven repayment plans to borrowers seeking to enroll, thereby failing to “carry out a \nprogram\" or “offer” borrowers these options. 20 U.S.C. § 1098e(b).  As noted before, the \ndefendants have issued a Stop Work Order to their servicers and issued a public statement \nconfirming that borrowers do not have access to any income-driven repayment plans, all while the \ndefendants are being instructed to dismantle their own agency. Borrowers, too, report that they are \nstuck in an untenable limbo. For § 706(1) purposes, this is enough. The defendants’ withholding \nof this legal obligation warrants relief and the plaintiff is likely to succeed on this claim.16  \n \n16 The Administrative Procedure Act  includes § 706(1) relief for unlawful withholding and, separately, unreasonably \ndelaying agency action. For the latter set of cases, courts have developed a series of factors to evaluate whether a delay \nis unreasonable. In this context though, where the relief is simply being shut off entirely, the inquiry ends.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 27 of 50\n \nb.  The defendants’ action is also unlawful under § 706(2) because it is \ninconsistent  with  the  statute,  regulation,  and  contract,  and  is \nwithout a rational basis. \n \nIn addition to section 706(1), the Administrative Procedure Act also directs courts to “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action,” when such action is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Here, too, the plaintiff  \nmeets its burden. \n  To start, the defendants’ decision to issue a Stop Work order, and therefore close off access \nto all income-driven repayment plans for borrowers seeking to enroll, constitutes final agency \naction warranting review under § 706(2). To be final, an action must (1) “mark[] the consummation \nof the agency's decision-making process” and (2) be one by which “rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–\n79 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n  Here, the defendants’ decision satisfies both requirements. The Stop Work Order represents \nthe consummation of a decision – i.e., the defendants made the final decision that they will not \naccept or process applications to enroll in an income-driven repayment plan, and as a result an \nentire population of otherwise eligible borrowers cannot access income-driven repayment plans. \nSee Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959, at *13 (finding that “ordering a nationwide \npause on federal financial assistance” constitutes a final agency action); see also Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-cv-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 368852, at *10 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 3, 2025) (contrasting guidance documents with final agency actions). And, legal rights are \ncurtailed by that decision.  The plaintiff’s members are shut out of income-driven repayment \nprograms. See Dubreuil Decl. ¶ 14 (“I submitted an Income-Driven Repayment plan application \nto switch repayment plans, so that I could continue to make payments to receive forgiveness, but \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 28 of 50\n \nmy application has been stuck in review.”); Mason Dec. ¶ 15 (“I submitted an application for the \nIncome Based Repayment plan, which I understood was not part of the SAVE forbearance. That \napplication is still pending.”); McCall-Robinson Decl. ¶¶ 13-14 (“I was on track to have my loans \nforgiven in November 2024, but that was ripped away in July 2024 when my payments were placed \nin forbearance . . . I tried again in February [to switch plans] but was unable to submit an \napplication at all.”).  \n  Second, the decision is contrary to law and is arbitrary and capricious in various ways. As \ndiscussed above, there is a statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligation for the defendants to \nprovide access to income-driven repayment programs. If the defendants are permitted to simply \nshut down access to all income-driven repayment programs for new applicants, notwithstanding \nthese requirements, they would essentially have “unlimited power to rewrite the Education Act,” \nand would “effect[] a ‘fundamental revision of the statute, changing it from [one sort of] scheme . \n. . of regulation’ into an entirely different kind.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 502 (citation \nomitted). Furthermore, the defendants’ newly declared plan to take a raft of income-driven \nrepayment obligations which Congress specifically entrusted to the defendants and instead send \nthose responsibilities to the Small Business Administration is inconsistent with the plain terms of \nthe Higher Education Act. The defendants’ failure to offer any income-driven repayment plans to \nborrowers seeking to enroll violates these various laws and is therefore impermissible under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.  \n  The decision is also irrational. See Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm \nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983) (explaining governing standard as including where the \nagency “offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, \nor is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 29 of 50\n \nexpertise”). This is particularly true with respect to the IBR Plan. As discussed, even in the face \nof the ongoing litigation, the Biden Administration kept the IBR Plan open to borrowers because \nit had a legal obligation to do so and in light of the fact that earlier decisions (like the more recent \none) did not speak to the IBR Plan. This shows that the defendants can keep the IBR Plan open \neven if they have to modify aspects of the income-contingent repayment plans in light of the Eighth \nCircuit’s decision. Further, cutting off the IBR Plain is particularly irrational given the language \nin the Eighth Circuit’s decision underscoring its legality.  Again, the Eighth Circuit expressly \npointed to the provisions and existence of IBR as a reason to strike down provisions of the SAVE \nRule. See, e.g., AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1929 v. Fed. Labor Rels. Auth., 961 F.3d 452, 459 (D.C. \nCir. 2020) (“[T]he Authority departed from precedent based on a misreading of case law and \nwithout explaining the departure. Such a change is not ‘sensibly explained.’)(citation omitted);  \nc.  The Eighth Circuit’s decision is not a valid reason for shutting off \naccess to all income-driven repayment plans.   \n \nDespite their legal obligations, the defendants will likely come into court and argue that \nthe Eighth Circuit’s decision left them no choice and that they are re-evaluating the income-driven \nrepayments plans given that decision. As noted above, in response to this litigation, the defendants \nhave claimed that the “form” could be available as soon as this week. If the defendants make this \nargument, it will be flawed in several ways (beyond the fact that the defendants cannot just put off \ncompliance with legal obligations indefinitely, and that it is unclear whether the form’s mere \navailability will mean that the defendants will process such applications). This is all the more true \nin light of the subsequent announcement by President Trump instructing the defendants to self-\ndestruct.   \nTo start, nothing in the Eighth Circuit’s decision that casts any doubt on the legality of the \nIBR Plan, and there is no valid justification for shutting off access to the IBR Plan in light of that \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 30 of 50\n \ndecision. Indeed, the Eighth Circuit invoked the existence and terms of the IBR statute and plan to \nconclude that the forgiveness provision of income-contingent repayment plans was unlawful. Said \nplainly: even if the defendants had some justification for temporarily closing plans based on the \nICR statute, they have no justification for shutting off access to the IBR Plan.  \nEven if this Court would typically give the Government the benefit of the doubt in light of \nthe Eighth Circuit decision, the broader context—mass firing and an order directing the defendants \nto shutter themselves—suggests that this action is part of a broader scheme to completely stop all \nof the defendants’ work. Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019) (“We are \npresented, in other words, with an explanation for agency action that is incongruent with what the \nrecord  reveals  about  the  agency’s  priorities  and  decisionmaking  process”  and  “[a]ccepting \ncontrived reasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.”).  \n2.  The defendants’ misconduct is causing the plaintiff and its members \nirreparable harm. \nThe plaintiff, on its own behalf and on behalf of its members, seek an injunction because \ntheir injures are “certain and great,” “actual and not theoretical,” and “of such imminence that there \nis a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.” Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. \nEnergy Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (emphasis in original). This is so in \nseveral ways. \nFirst, the plaintiff as an organization is suffering irreparable harm because the  defendants’ \nconduct is causing it “to divert and expend” its “resources to address” the “allegedly wrongful \nconduct,” which is “enough to satisfy the[] burden of showing a likelihood of suffering irreparable \nharm.” Ind. State Conf. of the NAACP v. Lawson, 326 F. Supp. 3d 646, 662 (S.D. Ind. 2018) (citing \nAction NC v. Strach, 216 F. Supp. 3d 597, 643 (M.D.N.C. 2016)); see also League of Women \nVoters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (stating defendant's actions “unquestionably make \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 31 of 50\n \nit more difficult for the” organizations “to accomplish their primary mission,” which “provide[s] \ninjury for purposes both of standing and irreparable harm”). As the plaintiff’s representative \nexplains in her declaration, the organization has had to put other projects, including a new financial \nliteracy curriculum, on pause while it reallocates staff time to help its members with their student \nloans and to revise existing student loan resources in light of The defendants’ actions. Tammelleo \nDecl. ¶¶ 23-25. The plaintiff has also spent $250,000 to extend a contract with a technology \ncompany called Summer, which provides direct services to members with student debt, to help its \nmembers navigate this uncertainty.  Id. ¶ 26. The plaintiff had planned to end this contract, but felt \nit could not given the turmoil. Id. Because the defendants have sovereign immunity as to those \nfinancial harms, these costs are not recoverable, rendering the injury irreparable. Missouri v. \nTrump, 128 F.4th at 996. \nSecond, the Government’s action is leaving Plaintiff’s members in a position where they \nare financially harmed in a way that threatens their access to basic necessities. Indeed, “[a]lthough \neconomic harm generally does not constitute irreparable injury, economic injury may be the basis \nfor an injunction where a plaintiff lives on a fixed income and where minimal increases in the cost \nof living creates a ‘potential [for] financial disaster’ and the possible deprivation of ‘life’s \nnecessities.’” Calvillo Manriquez v. DeVos, 345 F. Supp. 3d 1077 (N.D. Cal. 2018) (quoting \nUnited Steelworkers of Am., AFL-CIO v. Textron, Inc., 836 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1987); see also \nGolden v. Kelsey-Hayes Co., 73 F.3d 648, 657 (6th Cir. 1996) (economic harm satisfied factor of \nirreparable injury because plaintiffs were “unable to absorb even relatively small increases in their \nexpenses  without  extreme  hardship”).  Here,  because  the  plaintiff’s  members  cannot  access \nincome-driven repayment plans and Public Service Loan Forgiveness, the plaintiff’s  members are \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 32 of 50\n \nconsidering bankruptcy as an alternative,17 have forgone basic necessities,18 and are in distress \nabout how to navigate major life milestones.19 \nFinally, the plaintiff’s members are being denied the ability to earn credit towards Public \nService Loan Forgiveness and have no way to ever rectify the issue absent an injunction ensuring \naccess to the income-driven repayment plans.20 As declarants explain: As declarants explain:  \n•  “Every month I spend in this forbearance delays my forgiveness, thus delaying \nfreedom from my student loan debt, and affording me an opportunity to live a better \nlife. The weight of my student loan debt has felt like a ball and chain and impacts \nevery life decision that I make.” Dubreuil Decl. ¶ 15; \n \n•  “According to my account with StudentAid.gov, I have 117 of the 120 credits \nneeded for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. This does not reflect any of the time \nor payments that I have made since my loan was placed in forbearance in June \n2024. I should have accrued the three remaining credits by August 2024, at which \npoint I should have had my loans forgiven.” Mason Decl. ¶ 12; \n \n•  “I submitted an application to switch to a different IDR plan in December 2024, but \nthe application has continued to process without any update. I tried again in \nFebruary 2025 but was unable to submit an application at all.” McCall-Robinson \nDecl. ¶ 14. \n \nThis constitutes irreparable harm since because they have no recourse, absent an injunction, \nto gain credit towards a cancellation program for which they have a statutory right. And, not for \nnothing, it would be bizarre if granting borrowers forgiveness could constitute irreparable harm \n \n17 Mason Decl. ¶ 19; Tammelleo Decl. ¶ 18. \n \n18 Mason Decl. ¶ 16 (not heating home to save money); Tammelleo Decl. ¶¶ 19, 21 (members struggling to afford \nchildcare and children’s basic needs); McCall-Robinson Decl. ¶ 18 (“If forgiveness is delayed, it will continue to \nprevent me from building a better life for myself and my children.”). \n \n19 Dubreuil Decl. ¶ 16 (unable to save for retirement); Tammelleo Decl. ¶ 20 (member approaching retirement \ncannot obtain an affordable monthly payment); Mason Decl. ¶ 18 (“I am engaged to be married, but wanted to have \nmy student loan debt forgiven before marrying and expected this would occur in the fall of 2024. Because I have not \nbeen able to accrue more credit toward Public Service Loan Forgiveness, I am stressed at the prospect of bringing \nmy debt into my marriage.”). \n \n20 The Government may assert the “buy back” provision in the Public Service Loan Forgiveness regulations solve for \nthis issue. 34 C.F.R. § 685.219(g)(6). However, as the declarations attached to this brief show, the “buy back” \nprovision exists only in name, not in practice, and the defendants have never provided any guidance on when, if ever, \nit will actually be an available option for borrowers.   \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 33 of 50\n \nwhen a plaintiff challenges a student loan forgiveness program, see Missouri v. Trump, 128 F. 4th \nat 966, but for borrowers to be denied access to injunctive relief when the government prevents \nthem from accessing loan forgiveness programs.    \n3.  The public interest and balance of equities warrant an injunction. \nWhen a government entity is a party to the case, the third and fourth factors merge. \nPursuing Am.’s Greatness v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016). “It is \nwell established that the Government ‘cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an \nunlawful practice.’” C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Open Cmtys. \nAlliance v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017)). “There is generally no public interest \nin the perpetuation of an unlawful agency action.” Id. (citation omitted). “To the contrary, there is \na substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws.” Id. \n(citation omitted). \n  Here, in light of the ongoing and severe irreparable harm in continuing to deny access to \nstatutorily  mandated  access  to  income-driven  repayment  plans  and  Public  Service  Loan \nForgiveness benefits, there is no public interest in the continuation of the defendants’ unlawful \nhold on these programs. The plaintiff’s members and anyone who cannot afford to repay their \nstudent loans (see generally Sabens Decl. and Baetz Decl.) will be continued to be forced into \nuntenable financial circumstances, unable to pay bills and contemplating bankruptcy, while these \nprograms remain on indefinite hold. The public has a strong interest in restoring access to these \ncongressionally mandated programs while the Government cannot possibly claim any harm from \ncessation of an unlawful shutdown of these income-driven repayment programs.   \nIII.  CONCLUSION \nAt bottom, the defendants are failing to meet their legal obligations, all at the expense of \nhard-working public servants and vulnerable student loan borrowers. The Court should grant this \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00802-RBW     Document 10     Filed 03/24/25     Page 34 of 50\n \nmotion and direct the defendants to return to the status quo ante and ensure access to at least one \nincome-driven repayment program.21 \n \n \nDate:  March 24, 2025      /s/ John G.
