    "summary": "<p>This case, brought by legally blind Minnesota residents, alleged that an inaccessible website was in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act against an inaccessible website. Plaintiffs sued Lions Brand Yarn Company on March 15, 2024, in U.S. District Court in the District of Minnesota. Plaintiffs, legally blind residents of Minnesota, set forth in their complaint that the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. &sect; 12181, et seq., applies to online spaces and websites of public accommodations; accommodations compliant with the ADA include navigable features compatible with screen reader technology. Lion Brand Yarn Company is a company that produces knitting and craft yarn, and maintains an interactive, online business presence (www.lionbrand.com). Plaintiffs alleged that defendant&rsquo;s website was not accessible to screen-reader users: Among other barriers, defendant&rsquo;s website failed to alert screen readers to pop-up window contents, and maintained content which it did not make accessible to screen readers, such as in the form of non-text images, unordered lists, or color-coding. Plaintiffs alleged that the defendant&rsquo;s website was not made fully and equally accessible to low-vision and/or blind individuals, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act in federal law and the Minnesota Human Rights Act in state law.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a class action and a permanent injunction, which would require defendants to change their corporate policies and ensure that their website and online offerings are made fully, equally, and independently accessible to individuals with visual disabilities. Plaintiffs noted that as web-based technologies are regularly updated, a &ldquo;one-time fix&rdquo; is not an appropriate vehicle for injunctive-relief here: instead, a change in corporate policy is necessary to ensure long-term and continuing compliance with the ADA.</p>\r\n<p>The matter was assigned to Judge Katherine M. Menendez.</p>\r\n<p>On June 7, 2024, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. In its motion, defendant argued that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for a violation of Title III of the ADA, because the statute applies to &ldquo;places of public accommodation.&rdquo; Defendant argued that its website does not constitute a place of public accommodation within the meaning of the statute.</p>\r\n<p>On July 12, 2024, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The court made an order on July 16, 2024, noting that, as plaintiffs had amended their complaint, defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss was denied as moot. On July 30, 2024, defendant re-filed their motion to dismiss, which was substantially the same as their original motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>On February 6, 2025, the court issued its order, denying the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss. 765 F.Supp.3d 808. In responding to defendant&rsquo;s claim that the plaintiffs had failed to make out a cognizable claim, the court observed that Title III of the ADA provides a broad definition of &ldquo;public accommodation&rdquo;, including places such as restaurants, movie theaters, and places of education. The court observed that websites were not expressly included as an example of a place of public accommodation, and that there was a circuit split (unresolved in the Eighth Circuit, where this matter was being heard) on whether a place of public accommodation must be a physical structure. Here, the court held that a website &ndash; even if it is not a physical structure &ndash; is a public accommodation for purposes of Title III of the ADA. The court held that while the statutory language itself left this issue open to interpretation, the was persuaded by the line of district court caselaw which took an expansive view on what fell within the scope of the ADA. Therefore, as defendant&rsquo;s website constitutes a &ldquo;place of public accommodation&rdquo;, the court ruled it appropriate to deny the defendant&rsquo;s motion to dismiss.</p>\r\n<p>Since the motion to dismiss, pretrial scheduling notice and order has been released. However, no other significant case developments have occurred, and the case is pending further updates as of April 13, 2025.</p>",

This case arises because Defendant’s Website (www.lionbrand.com) (the \n“Website” or “Defendant’s Website”) is not fully and equally accessible to people who are \nblind or who have low vision in violation of both the general non-discriminatory mandate \nand the effective communication and auxiliary aids and services requirements of the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  42  U.S.C.  §  12181,  et  seq.  (the  “ADA”)  and  its \nimplementing regulations. In addition to the claim under the ADA, Plaintiffs also assert a \ncompanion cause of action under the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA). Plaintiffs \nseek a permanent injunction requiring a change in Defendant’s corporate policies to cause \nits online store to become, and remain, accessible to individuals with visual disabilities; a \ncivil penalty payable to the state of Minnesota pursuant to Minn. Stat. 363A.33, Subd. 6 \nand Minn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023); damages, and a damage multiplier pursuant to \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and Minn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023). \n2.  As the National Federation of the Blind has explained: \n   \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 2 of 24\nIn many ways, individuals with disabilities rely on Web content more so than their \nnondisabled peers because of inherent transportation, communication, and other \nbarriers. A blind person does not have the same autonomy to drive to a covered \nentity’s office as a sighted person. A deaf or hard-of-hearing person does not have \nthe same opportunity to call a covered entity’s office. A person with an intellectual \ndisability does not have the same ability to interact independently with the staff at a \ncovered  entity’s  office.  The  24-hour-a-day  availability  of  information  and \ntransactions  on  covered  entity  Websites  and  mobile  apps  provides  a  level  of \nindependence and convenience that cannot be replicated through any other means. \nThat is why the number of Americans who rely on the Internet has increased year \nafter year and why entities offer information and transactions through that unique \nmedium. \n \nSee Comment from disability rights organizations to DOJ Supplemental Advance Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of \nWeb Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities,” C RT Docket No \n128, RIN 119 -AA65, Answer 57 (October 7, 2016) (citations omitted). \n \n3.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others who are similarly situated, seek \nrelief  including an injunction requiring  Defendant to  make its  Website accessible to \nPlaintiffs and the putative class; and requiring Defendant to adopt sufficient policies, \npractices, and procedures, the details of which are more fully described below, to ensure \nthat Defendant’s Website remains accessible in the future. Plaintiffs also seek an award of \nstatutory attorney’s fees and costs, damages, a damages multiplier, a civil penalty, and such \nother relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n4.  The injunctive relief  that Plaintiffs seek will inure to the benefit of an \nestimated 2.3 percent of the United States population who reports having a visual disability. \nSee Erickson, W., Lee, C., von Schrader, S., Disability Statistics from the American \nCommunity  Survey  (ACS),  Cornell  University  Yang-Tan  Institute  (YTI), \nwww.disabilitystatistics.org (last accessed Apr. 12, 2022). \n  2 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 3 of 24\n5.  It will also benefit Defendant, who will extend its market reach to this \npopulation. See Sharron Rush, The Business Case for Digital Accessibility, W3C Web \nAccessibility  Initiative  (Nov.  9,  2018),  https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/  (last \naccessed Apr. 12, 2022) (“The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion \npeople with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the \nonline experience for all users.”). \nPRELIMINARY FACTS \n6.  In a September 25, 2018, letter to U.S. House of Representative Ted Budd, \nU.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd confirmed that \npublic accommodations must make the Website they own, operate, or control equally \naccessible  to  individuals  with  disabilities.  Assistant  Attorney  General  Boyd’s  letter \nprovides: \nThe Department [of Justice] first articulated its interpretation that the ADA \napplies  to  public  accommodations’  Website  over  20  years  ago.  This \ninterpretation is consistent with the ADA’s title III requirement that the \ngoods,  services,  privileges,  or  activities  provided  by  places  of  public \naccommodation be equally accessible to people with disabilities. \nSee Letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd, U.S. Department of Justice, \nto Congressman Ted Budd, U.S. House of Representatives (Sept. 25, 2018). \n \n7.  Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are blind and low-vision \nindividuals and are reliant upon screen reader technology to navigate the Internet. \n8.  Screen  reader  “software  translates  the  visual  internet  into  an  auditory \nequivalent. At a rapid pace, the software reads the content of a webpage to the user.” \n  3 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 4 of 24\nAndrews  v.  Blick  Art  Materials,  LLC,  286  F.Supp.3d  365,  374  (E.D.N.Y.  2017)  (J. \nWeinstein). \nThe screen reading software uses auditory cues to allow a visually impaired \nuser to effectively use Websites. For example, when using the visual internet, \na seeing user learns that a link may be “clicked,” which will bring her to \nanother webpage, through visual cues, such as a change in the color of the \ntext (often text is turned from black to blue). When the sighted user's cursor \nhovers over the link, it changes from an arrow symbol to a hand. \nThe screen reading software uses auditory—rather than visual—cues to relay \nthis same information. When a sight-impaired individual reaches a link that \nmay be “clicked on,” the software reads the link to the user, and after reading \nthe text of the link says the word “clickable.” … Through a series of auditory \ncues read aloud by the screen reader, the visually impaired user can navigate \na Website by listening and responding with her keyboard. \n9.  Web-based technologies have features and content that are modified on a \ndaily, and in some instances on an hourly basis. As a result, a one-time “fix” to an \ninaccessible  Website  will  not  cause  the  Website  to  remain  accessible  without  a \ncorresponding  change  in  corporate  policies  related  to  those  web-based  technologies. \nJonathan Lazur et al., Ensuring Digital Accessibility Through Process and Policy 140 \n(2015).  \n10.  As one leading commentator notes, \nThe most significant problem is maintaining the accessibility of a large \ncommercial site. Without policies, procedures, and metrics—such as testing \na release for accessibility before posting to the Website and training in \naccessible design (so that accessibility is part of the design process the way, \nsay, cybersecurity is)—the site’s status as accessible will be temporary at \nbest.  \n \n  4 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 5 of 24\nSee Fighting for Accessible Website under the ADA: Daniel Goldstein, Brown \nGoldstein  Levy,  Baltimore,  Bloomberg  BNA,  Jan.  13,  2016,  ISSN  1098-5190 \n(reproduced with permission from Electronic Commerce & Law Report, 21 ECLR, \n2, 1/13/16)  \n11.  To evaluate whether an inaccessible Website has been rendered accessible \nand whether corporate policies related to web-based technologies have been changed in a \nmeaningful manner that will cause the Website to remain accessible, the Website must be \nreviewed on a periodic basis using both automated accessibility screening tools, manual \nand end-user testing by disabled individuals. \n[I]f you have planned to redesign or add a certain segment to your site, then \nmake it accessible from the start. It’s far cheaper to plan for an elevator than \nto decide to add one once your 30-story building is complete. Or if you are \nre-branding, consider using templates that will ensure accessibility. Make \nsure you have policies, procedures, and metrics in place so that you know if \nyou are maintaining accessibility and can identify why, if you are not. Most \nof  all,  consult  disabled  consumers  or  a  consumer  organization  before \ndeciding what you are going to do and have consumers actually test the \nchanges.  \nSomething you imagine you may need to do, you may not need to do at all, \nor may be able to do much cheaper. Something you hadn’t thought to do may \nbe critical to accessibility. And, of course, if you work with the disability \ncommunity, they will spread the word that this is no longer a site to be \navoided, but to be used. \nId. at 3. \n12.  “As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it is important to consider \nfactors  that  can  facilitate  or  impede  technology  adoption  and  use  by  people  with \ndisabilities.” National Disability Policy: A Progress Report, Nat’l Council on Disability \n(Oct. 7, 2016), https://ncd.gov/sites/default/files/NCD_ProgressReport_ES_508.pdf. \n  5 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 6 of 24\n13.  This is especially true with respect to accessing goods and services over the \ninternet, where people with disabilities stand to benefit immensely if online services are \nfully and equally accessible to them.  \n14.  When digital content is properly formatted, it is universally accessible to \neveryone. When it’s not, the content provider fails to communicate with individuals with a \nvisual disability effectively. In turn, these individuals must expend additional time and \neffort to overcome communication barriers not applicable to sighted users, which may \nrequire the assistance of third parties or, in some instances, deny outright access to the \nonline service.  \n15.  Such difficulties often lead disabled individuals to abandon the process of \npurchasing items online after they begin. See Kasey Wehrum, Your Website is Scaring \nCustomers  Away.  5  Easy  Ways  to  Fix  It.,  Inc.  Mag.  (Jan.  2014), \nhttps://www.inc.com/magazine/201312/kasey-wehrum/how-to-getonline-customers-to-\ncomplete-purchase.html  (documenting  the  most  common  causes  of  shopping  cart \nabandonment, including: “Your Checkout button is hard to find[,]” “Shoppers question the \nsafety of their personal info[,]” and “Getting through the checkout process takes multiple \nclicks.”). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  The claims alleged arise under Title III such that this Court’s jurisdiction is \ninvoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 42 U.S.C. § 12188.  \n17.   Defendant  purposefully  avails  itself  of  the  benefits  and  advantages  of \noperating an interactive, online business open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a \n  6 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 7 of 24\nyear which, through its Website, enters into contracts for the sale of its products with \nresidents of Minnesota and participates in the State of Minnesota’s economy by offering \nand providing services over the internet to Minnesota residents, including Plaintiffs.   \n18.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because this is \nthe judicial district in which a substantial part of the acts and omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims occurred. As described in additional detail below, Plaintiffs were injured \nwhen they attempted to access Defendant’s Website from Minnesota but encountered \nbarriers that denied her full and equal access to Defendant’s online goods, content, and \nservices. \nPARTIES \n19.  Plaintiffs  are  and,  at  all  times  relevant  hereto,  have  been  residents  of \nMinnesota. \n20.  Plaintiffs are and, at all times relevant hereto, have been legally blind and are \ntherefore disabled under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2), and the regulations implementing \nthe ADA set forth at 28 CFR §§ 36.101 et seq.   \n21.  Defendant Lion Brand Yarn Company is a New Jersey based Company and \nis headquartered at 135 Kero Road, Carlstadt, NJ 07072.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, Defendant is the oldest producer of knitting and \ncraft yarn in the United States. \n23.  Upon information and belief, Defendant website was first launched in 1996 \nand most recently had 1.13 million United States visitors to its website in the month of \n  7 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 8 of 24\nFebruary  2024.  Semrush,  https://www.semrush.com/website/lionbrand.com/overview/ \n(last visited March 14, 2024). \nADDITIONAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \n24.  In order to browse, research, or shop online and purchase the products and \nservices that Defendant offers at Lions Brand, individuals may visit Defendant’s Website.  \n25.  Defendant owns, operates, and/or controls its Website and is responsible for \nthe  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  concerning  the  Website’s  development  and \nmaintenance.  \n26.  As a consequence of her experience visiting Defendant’s Website, including \nin the past year, and from an investigation performed on her behalf, Plaintiffs found \nDefendant’s Website has a number of digital barriers that deny screen-reader users like \nPlaintiffs full and equal access to important Website content – content Defendant makes \navailable to its sighted Website users. For example: \na.  Defendant’s Website fails to alert screen readers to pop-up window content. \nInstead, screen readers remain focused on the content of the  Website’s \nunderlying page. As a result, pop-up content Defendant deems sufficiently \nimportant to convey to its sighted Website visitors is completely unavailable \nto screen reader users; \n \nb.  The  Website  does  not  provide  sufficient  screen  reader-accessible  text \nequivalent for important non-text image(s). People who are blind will not be \nable to understand the content and purpose of images, such as pictures, \nillustrations,  and  charts  when  no  text  alternative  is  provided.  Text \nalternatives convey the purpose of an image, including pictures, illustrations, \ncharts, etc.;  \n \nc.  Defendant’s  Website  has  inaccessible  unordered  lists  which  are \nunrecognized by screen reader technology. Users who depend on screen \nreader technology should know if and when unordered lists are presented and \navailable for viewing; and \n  8 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 9 of 24\n \nd.  Defendant’s Website uses color as the only means of conveying information, \nmaking the information unavailable to screen reader users. Screen readers do \nnot announce the color of text on a screen to the user, so a person who is \nblind would not be able to know that color is meant to convey certain \ninformation. \n \n27.   Still,  Plaintiffs  would  like  to,  intend  to,  and  will  attempt  to  access \nDefendant’s Website in the future to browse, research, or shop online and purchase the \nproducts and services that Defendant offers. \n28.  Defendant’s policies regarding the maintenance and operation of its Website \nfail to ensure its Website is fully accessible to, and independently usable by, individuals \nwith vision-related disabilities.  \n29.  Plaintiffs and the putative class have been, and in the absence of injunctive \nrelief will continue to be, injured, and discriminated against by Defendant’s failure to \nprovide its online Website content and services in a manner that is compatible with screen \nreader technology. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n30.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2), \nindividually and on behalf of the following class:  \nAll blind or have a low vision disability within the meaning of the ADA who use \nscreen  reader  auxiliary  aids  to  navigate  digital  online  content  and  who  have \naccessed, attempted to access, or who may access or attempt to access Defendant’s \nWebsite. \n \n31.  This  action  is  a  prototypical  civil-rights  action  of  the  kind  expressly \ncontemplated for class-certification by the draftsman of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The note \n  9 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 10 of 24\nto the 1966 amendment to Rule 23 states: “Subdivision (b)(2). This subdivision is intended \nto reach situations where a party has taken action or refused to take action with respect to \na class, and final relief of an injunctive nature or a corresponding declaratory nature, \nsettling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole, is appropriate. . . \nIllustrative are various actions in the civil rights filed where a party is charged with \ndiscriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one whose members are incapable of \nspecific enumeration.” See also, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:40 (5th ed. 2014) (“The \ntypes of civil rights cases that have often been certified as (b)(2) class actions include . . . \ndisability discrimination actions under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).”). \nNUMEROSITY \n32.  The class described above is so numerous that joinder of all individual \nmembers in one action would be impracticable.  \n33.  According to the United States Department of Justice: “The U.S. Census \nBureau’s 2002 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) found that there are \n51.2 million people with disabilities in the United States . . . Millions of people with \ndisabilities  regularly  travel,  shop,  and  eat  out  with  family  and  friends  .  .  .  The \nAdministration on Aging projects that by 2030 there will be more than 69 million people \nage 65 and older, making up approximately 20% of the total U.S. population. The large \nand growing market of people with disabilities has $175 billion in discretionary spending, \nAARP says that four million Americans turn 50 each year and that people age 50 and older \nspent nearly $400 billion in 2003. At age 50, adults are likely to experience age-related \nphysical changes that may affect hearing, vision, cognition, and mobility.” \n  10 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 11 of 24\n34.  According to the American Foundation for the Blind, an estimated 32.2 \nmillion adult Americans (or about 13% of all adult Americans) reported they either \"have \ntrouble\" seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses, or that they are blind or \nunable to see at all. \n35.  According to The National Federation of the Blind, the number of non-\ninstitutionalized individuals reported to have a visual disability in the United States in 2016 \nis 7,675,600 -- 86,500 of whom reside in Minnesota. \n36.  According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the number of people \nwith visual impairment or blindness in the United States is expected to double to more than \n8 million by 2050, according to projections based on the most recent census data and from \nstudies funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. \nAnother 16.4 million Americans are expected to have difficulty seeing due to correctable \nrefractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) that can \nbe fixed with glasses, contacts, or surgery. \n37.  According to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), Vision disability is one of the top 10 disabilities among adults 18 years and older. \n  38.  An estimated 2.3 percent of the United States population reports having a \nvisual disability.

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has documented consumers’ increasing \nreliance on the Internet to shop online: \n  11 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 12 of 24\nThe average consumer spends more than $1,700 per year on online shopping, a \nnumber that’s continuing to rise. The convenience, affordability, and ability to \ncompare prices with ease has led more and more customers to visit e-commerce \nsites before heading to a brick-and-mortar location.  \n \nSee Emily Heaslip, A Guide to Building an Online Store, U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n(Sept. 20, 2019), https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/startup/how-to-build-online-stores. \n \n40.  Researchers have determined that: 95% of consumers will buy at least half \nof their gifts online. The Leanplum survey found that 80% of respondents shop on their \nmobile devices.  See Emily Heaslip, Ways to Optimize Your E-Commerce Site for Mobile \nShopping,  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  (Jan.  6,  2020), \nhttps://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/building-mobilefriendly-commerce-\nWebsites. \n41.  According to at least one report, e-commerce is growing at the rate of 23% \neach year. See Emily Heaslip, The Complete Guide to Selling Online, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce  (Jan.  28,  2020),  https://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/small-\nbusiness-ecommerce-guide. \n42.  “The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion people with a \nspending power of more than $6 trillion.

These facts easily permit a common-sense inference that the numerosity \nrequirement has been met in this matter. \n44.  In addition, Plaintiffs anticipate that the record evidence gathered during \ndiscovery will further demonstrate that Rule 23(a)(1) has been satisfied in this matter.  \n  12 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 13 of 24\nTYPICALITY \n45.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the classes. The \nclaims of Plaintiffs and members of the classes are all based on the same legal theory and \nall arise from the same unlawful conduct. Plaintiffs and the class members all have the \nsame grievance and are all entitled to the same relief. \n46.  Plaintiffs’ interests align with the interests of the putative classes because she \nand each class member seek injunctive relief requiring Defendant to make changes to its \nexisting  Website  and  related  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  in  order  to  ensure \nDefendant’s Website becomes and remain ADA compliant, relief that would benefit all \nmembers of the proposed classes. \nCOMMON QUESTIONS OF FACT AND LAW \n47.  There  are  factual  and  legal  issues  common  to  Plaintiffs  and  all  class \nmembers. As explained herein, Defendant’s Website violates the ADA, and Defendant's \npolicies, practices, and procedures fail to ensure that its Website does not discriminate \nagainst people who are blind or have low vision within the meaning of the ADA. And this \nCourt can remedy Defendant’s violation of the ADA by issuing an injunction requiring \nchanges to Defendant’s Website and to its related policies, practices, and procedures. \nAccordingly, “there are questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(2), including: \na.  Whether Defendant’s Website fails to provide individuals who are blind or \nhave low vision with the appropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to \nensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities who rely \non scree-reader technology in violation of Title III of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations and the MHRA; \n  13 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 14 of 24\n \nb.  Whether Defendant’s Website-related policies, practices, and procedures \ndiscriminate against Plaintiffs and putative class members in violation of \nTitle III of the ADA and its implementing regulations and the MHRA; and \n \nc.  What measures are available to remedy the concerns of Plaintiffs and the \nputative class. \n \n48.  Whether  and  to  what  extent  Defendant’s  Website  and  related  policies, \npractices, and procedures are unlawful presents a common question with only one answer: \nDefendant’s Website and related policies, procedures, and practices either violate the ADA \nand the MHRA or they do not. If Defendant’s Website and related policies, procedures, \nand practices are discriminatory, then each class member is entitled to injunctive relief. On \nthe other hand, if the Website and related policies, procedures, and practices do not violate \nthe ADA and the MHRA, then no class member is entitled to injunctive relief. Either way, \nthis proceeding will generate a common answer, the determination of which “will resolve \nan issue… central to the validity of each one [of the class members’] claims in one stroke.” \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). \nADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \n49.  Plaintiffs will fairly, adequately, and vigorously represent and protect the \ninterests of the members of the class and have no interests antagonistic to the members of \nthe  class.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  is  competent  and  experienced  in  the \nprosecution of class action litigation and who possesses substantial ADA expertise. \n \n \n \n  14 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 15 of 24\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF TITLE III OF THE ADA \n50.  In the broadest terms, the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of a \ndisability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services of any place of public \naccommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Thus, to the extent Defendant does not provide \nPlaintiffs with full and equal access to its Website, it has violated the ADA’s general non-\ndiscriminatory mandate.  \n51.  Specific provisions within the ADA require,  inter alia, that “[a]  public \naccommodation shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to \nensure  effective  communication  with  individuals  with  disabilities.”  28  C.F.R.  § \n36.303(c)(1).  \n52.  The regulations set forth numerous examples of “auxiliary aids and services,” \nincluding “… accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods \nof making visually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low \nvision.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(b).  \n53.   Auxiliary aids and services include but are not limited to, audio recordings, \nscreen  reader  software,  magnification  software,  optical  readers,  secondary  auditory \nprograms, large print materials, accessible electronic and information technology, and \nother effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals who \nare  blind  or  have  low  vision,  and  other  similar  services  and  actions.  28  C.F.R.  §§ \n36.303(b)(2), (4).  \n  15 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 16 of 24\n54.  The term “auxiliary aids and services” also includes the “[a]cquisition or \nmodification of equipment or devices; and [o]ther similar services and actions.” Id. \n55.  The ADA Title III regulations further require that “[i]n order to be effective, \nauxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and \nin  such  a  way  as  to  protect  the  privacy  and  independence  of  the  individual  with  a \ndisability.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n56.  The House Committee on Education and Labor stated that it intended “that \nthe types of accommodation and services provided to individuals with disabilities, under \nall of the titles of this bill, should keep pace with the rapidly changing technology of the \ntimes,” and that technological advances “may require public accommodations to provide \nauxiliary aids and services in the future which today would not be required because they \nwould be held to impose undue burdens on such entities.” H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at \n108 (1990).   \n57.  Similarly, the United States Department of Justice, in promulgating the rules \nimplementing Title III in 1991, explained that it was “not possible to provide an exhaustive \nlist [of auxiliary aids and services], and such an attempt would omit new devices that will \nbecome available with emerging technology.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. C, p. 912 (discussion \nof § 36.303). \n58.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “assistive technology is not frozen in \ntime: as technology advances, [ ] accommodations should advance as well.” Enyart v. Nat'l \nConference of Bar Examiners, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1163 (9th Cir. 2011). \n  16 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 17 of 24\n59.   By failing to provide its Website’s content and services in a manner that is \ncompatible with auxiliary aids, Defendant has engaged, directly, or through contractual, \nlicensing, or other arrangements, in illegal disability discrimination, as defined by Title III, \nincluding without limitation:  \na.  denying individuals with visual disabilities opportunities to participate in and \nbenefit from the goods, content, and services available on its Website;  \n \nb.  affording individuals with visual disabilities access to its Website that is not \nequal to, or effective as, that afforded others;  \n \nc.  utilizing methods of administration that (i) have the effect of discriminating \non the basis of disability; or (ii) perpetuate the discrimination of others who \nare subject to common administrative control; \n \nd.  denying individuals with visual disabilities effective communication, thereby \nexcluding or otherwise treating them differently than others; and/or  \n \ne.  failing to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures \nwhere  necessary  to  afford  its  services,  privileges,  advantages,  or \naccommodations to individuals with visual disabilities. \n \n60.   Defendant has violated Title III by, without limitation, failing to make its \nWebsite’s services accessible by screen reader programs, thereby denying individuals with \nvisual disabilities the benefits of the Website, providing them with benefits that are not \nequal to those it provides others, and denying them effective communication.  \n61.   Defendant has further violated Title III by, without limitation, utilizing \nadministrative methods, practices, and policies that allow its Website to be made available \nwithout consideration of consumers who can only access the company’s online goods, \ncontent, and services with screen reader programs.  \n  17 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 18 of 24\n62.   Defendant’s ongoing violations of Title III have caused, and in the absence \nof an injunction will continue to cause, harm to Plaintiffs and other individuals with visual \ndisabilities.   \n63.   Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set \nforth and incorporated therein, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nVIOLATION OF THE MHRA \n64.  Minn. Stat. § 363A.11 provides: It is an unfair discriminatory practice: (1) to \ndeny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \nadvantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of […] \ndisability  […];  or  (2)  for  a  place  of  public  accommodation  not  to  make  reasonable \naccommodation to the known physical, sensory, or mental disability of a disabled person. \n65.  Under the general prohibitions established by the MHRA, Minn. Stat. § \n363A.11, subd. 2 (2023), it is unlawful discrimination to deny individuals with disabilities \nan opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \nadvantages,  or  accommodations  that  is  equal  to  the  opportunities  afforded  to  other \nindividuals. \n66.  Defendant has engaged in unfair discriminatory practices against Plaintiffs \nand others in that it has failed to ensure that Defendant’s Website and online content is \nfully accessible to persons with disabilities on an independent and equal basis in violation \nof the MHRA, and Minn. Stat. § 363A.11 (2023). \n67.  Plaintiffs have been denied full and equal access to the Website and have \nbeen denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, \n  18 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 1     Filed 03/15/24     Page 19 of 24\nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations offered therein on a full, independent, and \nequal basis. \n68.  Plaintiffs are without adequate remedy at law, have suffered and are suffering \nirreparable harm. \n69.  This Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 3-4 (2023), to issue an order directing Defendant to cease and \ndesist from their unfair discriminatory practices and to take affirmative action to make its \nWebsite readily accessible to and independently usable by individuals with disabilities.  \n70.  The Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023), to order Defendant to pay a civil penalty to the state \nof Minnesota.  \n71.  The Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023), to award damages, and a damage multiplier \npursuant. \n72.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  the  undersigned  counsel  for  the  filing  and \nprosecution of this action and are entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees from \nDefendant as part of the costs, pursuant to Minn.

Def.’s Mot. \n(Doc. 24). For the reasons that follow, the motion is denied. \nBACKGROUND \nBecause this case is before the Court on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 12(b)(6), the court accepts the factual allegations in the Amended Complaint as true for \npurposes of this Order. Plaintiffs Clarence Frost and Tammy Frost are legally blind. Am. \nCompl. ¶ 20 (Doc. 23). Ms. Frost does not have eyes and is completely blind. Id. ¶ 31. \nMr. Frost  has severe low vision.  Id. The  Frosts depend on the  use of screen  reader \ntechnology to navigate the internet. Id. \nLion Brand Yarn Company (“Lion Brand”) is the oldest producer of knitting and \ncraft yarn in the United States. Id. ¶¶ 22, 24. Lion Brand first launched a website for its \nbusiness in 1996. Id. ¶ 23. In February 2024, internet users in the United States visited Lion \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 2 of 22\nBrand’s website 1.13 million times. Id. Lion Brand makes its products available on its \nwebsite to those wishing to browse, research, or shop online. Id. ¶ 24. \nTammy  Frost  enjoys  knitting.  Id.  ¶ 29.  In  the  past,  Ms. Frost  purchased  Lion \nBrand’s yarn from retail stores, like Joann Fabrics. Id. ¶ 28. Ms. Frost has also visited the \nLion Brand website several times to look for yarn she could use in her knitting hobby. Id. \n¶ 29. However, at least three times that she visited Lion Brand’s website, the site conveyed \nconfusing, disorienting, and non-sensical information to Ms. Frost’s screen reader. Id. ¶ \n30. Whether on their own or together, the Frosts cannot navigate and understand Lion \nBrand’s website. Id. ¶ 31. Nor can they complete an online purchase from the website \nwithout assistance. Id.  \nAutomated and manual audits of the Lion Brand website confirmed the Frosts’ \ndescription of their user experience of the site and the site’s limited functionality with \nscreen reader technology. Id. ¶ 32. For example: \na.  Defendant’s Website fails to alert screen readers to pop-up \nwindow content such as a “Subscribe and Save $15% on \nYour Next Order” opportunity and instead conveys non-\nsensical, confusing, and disorienting information. Instead, \nscreen  reader  technology  narrates  the  content  of  the \nWebsite’s underlying page. As a result, pop-up content \nDefendant deems sufficiently important to convey to its \nsighted Website visitors is completely unavailable to screen \nreader users; \n \nb.  The Website does not provide sufficient screen reader-\naccessible text equivalent for important non-text image(s) \nsuch  as  various  color  swatch  choices  of  yarn  for  sale. \nPeople who are blind will not be able to understand the \ncontent  and  purpose  of  images,  such  as  pictures, \nillustrations,  and  charts  when  no  text  alternative  is \n2 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 3 of 22\nprovided. Text alternatives convey the purpose of an image, \nincluding pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.; \n \nc.  Defendant’s  Website  has  inaccessible  unordered  drop-\ndown menu lists which are unrecognized by screen reader \ntechnology. Users who depend on screen reader technology \nshould know if and when unordered lists are presented and \navailable for viewing; and \n \nd.  Defendant’s Website conveys information visually and via \ncolor  as  the  only  means  of  conveying  information  and \nwithout audible narration, including sales prices that have \nbeen reduced from $5.99 to $4.19” making the information \nunavailable to screen reader users. \n \nId. ¶ 32. \nDespite these issues, the Frosts intend to access Lion Brand’s website in the future \nto find and purchase Lion Brand’s products. Id. ¶ 33. However, for those with vision-\nrelated disabilities, Lion Brand’s website is not accessible to the same degree it is for \nindividuals who do not have similar vision impairments. Id. ¶ 34. \nThe Frosts raise disability-discrimination claims under both federal and state law. \nThey assert their own claims and claims on behalf of a putative class of Lion Brand’s \nwebsite’s users who have a low vision disability and require screen reader aids to navigate \nthe internet. In their first cause of action, the Frosts allege that Lion Brand violates Title III \nof the ADA by failing to provide its website’s content and services in a manner that is \ncompatible with screen reading aids. Id. ¶¶ 56–69. The Frosts specifically assert that Lion \nBrand’s website is a place of public accommodation within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 12182(a). Id. ¶¶ 25, 56. In their second cause of action, the Frosts assert that Lion Brand’s \nwebsite  violates  the  Minnesota  Human  Rights  Act’s  prohibition  on  disability \n3 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 4 of 22\ndiscrimination in the same ways. Id. ¶¶ 70–78. The Frosts seek certification of a class, a \ndeclaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, damages, and costs and attorneys’ fees. Id., \nPrayer for Relief. \nDISCUSSION \nLion Brand’s motion to dismiss raises a straightforward legal issue. Lion Brand \ncontends that the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim for a violation of Title III of \nthe ADA because that statute only applies to “places of public accommodation,” and a \nwebsite is not a place of public accommodation. Def.’s Mem. 1, 4–12 (Doc. 25). At least \nfor purposes of this motion, Lion Brand does not dispute that the Frosts have alleged that \nits website is inaccessible for those who require screen reading aids. In addition to arguing \nthat the Court should dismiss the Title III claim, Lion Brand argues that if the Title III \nclaim fails, the Court should decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the MHRA \nclaim and dismiss it without prejudice. Id. at 12.  \nI.  Legal Standards \nA. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain “enough \nfacts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 \nU.S. 544, 570 (2007). This standard does not require the inclusion of detailed factual \nallegations in a pleading, but the complaint must contain facts with enough specificity “to \nraise a right to relief above the speculative level.” Id. at 555. “Threadbare recitals of the \nelements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements,” are not sufficient. \nAshcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). In applying \n4 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 5 of 22\nthis standard, the Court must assume the facts in the complaint to be true and take all \nreasonable inferences from those facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Morton \nv. Becker, 793 F.2d 185, 187 (8th Cir. 1986); see also Waters v. Madson, 921 F.3d 725, \n734 (8th Cir. 2019). \nB. Statutory Interpretation \nThe issue presented by Lion Brand’s motion is one of statutory interpretation. That \ntask “begins with the statute’s plain language,” and when “the intent of Congress can be \nclearly discerned from the statute’s language, the judicial inquiry must end.” Union Pac. \nRR Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 113 F.4th 823, 833 (8th Cir. 2024) (quoting United States \nv. Lester, 92 F.4th 740, 742 (8th Cir. 2024)). First, courts must “determine whether the \nlanguage at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning with regard to the particular \ndispute in the case.” LaCurtis v. Express Med. Transps., Inc., 856 F.3d 571, 578 (8th Cir. \n2017) (quoting Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997)). To decide whether \nthe statutory language is plain or ambiguous, courts refer “to the language itself, the \nspecific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a \nwhole.” Id. (quoting Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341); see also King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, \n486 (2015) (“But oftentimes the meaning—or ambiguity—of certain words or phrases may \nonly become evident when placed in context.”). The court engaging in this task uses the \nordinary meaning of terms in the statute. Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. \n427, 436 (2019).  \n5 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 6 of 22\nIf the statute’s language lends itself to more than one reasonable interpretation, it is \nambiguous, and courts may examine other sources to determine legislative intent. Stanley \nv. Cottrell, Inc., 784 F.3d 466 (8th Cir. 2015) (citing Owner-Operator Indep. Drivers Ass’n \nv. Supervalu, Inc., 651 F.3d 857, 863 (8th Cir. 2011)). However, “[a] provision that may \nseem ambiguous in isolation is often clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme . . . \nbecause  only  one  of  the  permissible  meanings  produces  a  substantive  effect  that  is \ncompatible with the rest of the law.” King, 576 U.S. at 492 (quoting United Sav. Ass’n of \nTex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Assocs., Ltd., 484 U.S. 365, 371 (1988)). \nII.  Title III of the ADA and Places of Public Accommodation \nA. The Purpose and Language of the ADA \n“Congress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy widespread discrimination against \ndisabled individuals.” PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). Among other \nthings, Congress found that “discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in \nsuch  critical  areas  as  employment,  housing,  public  accommodations,  education, \ntransportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and \naccess to public services. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(3). The ADA’s purpose includes the \naim  “to  provide  a  clear  and  comprehensive  national  mandate  for  the  elimination  of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(b)(1). “After \nthoroughly investigating the problem, Congress concluded that there was a ‘compelling \nneed’ for a ‘clear and comprehensive national mandate’ to eliminate discrimination against \ndisabled individuals, and to integrate them ‘into the economic and social mainstream of \n6 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 7 of 22\nAmerican life.’” PGA Tour, 532 U.S. at 675 (quoting S. Rep. No. 101–116, p. 20 (1989); \nH.R. Rep. No. 101–485, pt. 2, p. 50 (1990), U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 1990, pt. 2, \npp. 303, 332). \nIn relevant part, the ADA provides: \nNo individual shall be discriminated against on the basis of \ndisability  in  the  full  and  equal  enjoyment  of  the  goods, \nservices, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations \nof any place of public accommodation by any person who \nowns,  leases  (or  leases  to),  or  operates  a  place  of  public \naccommodation. \n \n42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). The elements of a disability discrimination claim under Title III \ninclude that: (1) the plaintiff is disabled, (2) the defendant owns, leases or operates a place \nof public accommodation, (3) the defendant engaged in conduct adverse to the plaintiff \nbecause of the plaintiff’s disability, and (4) the defendant failed or refused to provide the \nplaintiff a reasonable accommodation for the plaintiff’s disability. Koester v. Young Men’s \nChristian Ass’n of Greater St. Louis, 855 F.3d 908, 910 (8th Cir. 2017) (quoting Amir v. \nSt. Louis Univ., 184 F.3d 1017, 1027 (8th Cir. 1999)). \nTitle III of the ADA provides a broad definition of “public accommodation.” 42 \nU.S.C.  § 12181(7).  For  example,  the  list  of  public  accommodations  includes  hotels, \nrestaurants and bars, movie theaters, convention centers, bakeries, service establishments, \npublic transportation stations, places of public display or collection, places of recreation, \nplaces of education, and social service establishments. Id. § 12181(7)(A)–(L). These “12 \nextensive categories of facilities . . . are to be construed liberally to afford people with \ndisabilities  equal  access  to  the  wide  variety  of  establishments  available  to  the  non-\n7 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 8 of 22\ndisabled.” Bauer v. Muscular Dystrophy Ass’n, Inc., 268 F. Supp. 2d 1281, 1289–90 (D. \nKan. 2003) (citing PGA Tour, 532 U.S. at 666–67). \nHowever, websites are not expressly included in the list of public accommodations \nreferred to in the statutory definition. Consequently, Lion Brand argues that Title III of the \nADA does not apply to its website. \nB. Circuit Split \nThe parties agree that the Eighth Circuit has not resolved the issue now before this \nCourt. They also agree that there is a split among the Eighth Circuit’s sister circuits on the \nbroad question of whether a place of public accommodation must be a physical structure. \nSome courts have held that Title III of the ADA unambiguously applies only to \nphysical structures. Ford v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601 (3d Cir. 1998); Peoples \nv. Discover Fin. Servs., Inc., 387 F. App’x 179 (3d Cir. 2010); Parker v. Metro. Life Ins. \nCo., 121 F.3d 1006 (6th Cir. 1997) (en banc); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., \n198 F.3d 1104 (9th Cir. 2000).1 In Parker, Ford, and Weyer, the plaintiffs argued that \nTitle III’s prohibition on discrimination in places of public accommodation prohibited their \nformer employers and the administrators of employer-sponsored disability benefits plans \nfrom providing a greater level of benefits to individuals with physical disabilities than for \n \n1 Lion Brand contends that the Eleventh Circuit falls on the same side of the circuit split as the \nThird, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits, citing Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 227 F. Supp. 2d 1312 \n(S.D. Fla. 2002), appeal dismissed, 385 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir. 2004). However, it is not apparent \nfrom the decision in the Access Now appeal that the Eleventh Circuit has weighed in on the \nwebsite-as-public-accommodation debate. Although the Eleventh Circuit issued a decision in 2021 \nholding that websites are not places of public accommodation under Title III, it later vacated that \ndecision following rehearing after the district court’s injunction expired. Gil v. Winn-Dixie Stores, \nInc., 21 F.4th 775 (11th Cir. 2021), vacating Gil v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., 993 F.3d 1266 (11th \nCir. 2021). \n8 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 9 of 22\nthose with mental disabilities. Parker, 121 F.3d at 1008; Ford, 145 F.3d at 603; Weyer, \n198 F.3d at 1107–08. In each case the courts reviewed the categories within the statutory \ndefinition of “public accommodation” and determined that a public accommodation is a \nphysical place open to the public. Parker, 121 F.3d at 1014 (applying the noscitur a sociis \ncanon of statutory construction to the list of examples in 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)); Ford, 145 \nF.3d at 612–13 (stating that interpreting a public accommodation to be a physical place is \n“in keeping with the host of examples of public accommodations provided by the ADA, \nall of which refer to places”); Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1114 (reviewing the list in § 12181(7) \nand applying the “principle of noscitur a sociis”). As a result, each court held that while \nTitle III of the ADA would prohibit disability discrimination in access to, for example, an \ninsurance company’s offices, it would not govern the content of a long-term disability \npolicy  offered  by  an  employer.  See,  e.g.,  Weyer,  198  F.3d  1114–15  (drawing  this \ndistinction and discussing Parker and Ford).2 \nOther courts have held that Title III’s definition of public accommodation includes \nareas that are not physical structures. Carparts Distr. Ctr., Inc. v. Automotive Wholesaler’s \nAss’n of New England, Inc., 37 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 1994); Doe v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., \n179  F.3d  557  (7th  Cir.  1999).  Both  cases  addressed  ADA  discrimination  claims  by \n \n2 In Peoples, the plaintiff was a blind credit cardholder who sued the card’s servicer, claiming that \nit violated Title III of the ADA by failing to reasonably accommodate cardholders with vision \nimpairments. The plaintiff had a claim that fraudulent charges were placed on his credit card and \nthe servicer failed to consider his blindness when addressing his fraud claim and refusing to credit \nhis account for disputed charges. 387 F. App’x at 181–82. Following the decision in Ford, the \nPeoples  court  found  that  the  plaintiff’s  claim  failed  as  a  matter  of  law  because  public \naccommodations to which Title III applied are limited to physical locations. Id. at 183–84. \n9 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 10 of 22\nplaintiffs whose lifetime benefits under insurance policies for medical care for AIDS were \ncapped at a lower amount than the cap for other conditions. \nIn Carparts, the plaintiff alleged that his employer’s health benefit plan violated the \nADA because it limited lifetime benefits for illnesses related to AIDS to $25,000, but \nprovided $1,000,000 in lifetime benefits for other conditions. Id. at 14–15. The Carparts \ncourt found the district court erred in interpreting the term public accommodations in \nTitle III to be “limited to actual physical structures with definite physical boundaries which \na person physically enters for the purpose of utilizing the facilities or obtaining services \ntherein.” Id. at 18. In reaching the conclusion that “a place of public accommodation” was \nnot so limited, the court observed that the definition of a public accommodation “includes \na ‘travel service,’ a ‘shoe repair service,’ an ‘office of an accountant, or lawyer,’ an \n‘insurance office,’ a ‘professional office of a healthcare provider,’ and ‘other services \nestablishments.’” Id. at 19 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(F)). According to the First \nCircuit, “[t]he plain meaning of the terms do not require ‘public accommodations’ to have \nphysical structures for persons to enter.” Id.  \nCongress  clearly  contemplated  that  ‘service  establishments’ \ninclude providers of services which do not require a person to \nphysically  enter  an  actual  physical  structure.  Many  travel \nservices  conduct  business  by  telephone  or  correspondence \nwithout requiring their customers to enter an office in order to \nobtain  their  services.  Likewise,  one  can  easily  imagine  the \nexistence of other service establishments conducting business \nby  mail  and  phone  without  providing  facilities  for  their \ncustomers to enter in order to utilize their services. It would be \nirrational  to  conclude  that  persons  who  enter  an  office  to \npurchase services are protected by the ADA, but persons who \npurchase the same services over the telephone or by mail are \nnot. Congress could not have intended such an absurd result. \n10 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 11 of 22\n \nId. \n  Further,  the  Carparts  court  found  its  interpretation  was  consistent  with  the \nlegislative history of the ADA. Id. The court said that a person reading the “Committee \nReport describing the operations of Title III could easily come away with the impression \nthat it is primarily concerned with access in the sense of either physical access to a place \nof  public  accommodation  or  something  analogous,  such  as  access  provided  through \ntelephone lines, messengers or some other medium.” Id. at 19–20. The Carparts court \nconcluded: \nNeither Title III nor its implementing regulations make any \nmention of physical boundaries or physical entry. Many goods \nand  services  are  sold  over  the  telephone  or  by  mail  with \ncustomers  never  physically  entering  the  premises  of  a \ncommercial  entity  to  purchase  the  goods  or  services.  To \nexclude this broad category of businesses from the reach of \nTitle  III  and  limit  the  application  of  Title  III  to  physical \nstructures  which  persons  must  enter  to  obtain  goods  and \nservices would run afoul of the purposes of the ADA and would \nseverely  frustrate  Congress's  intent  that  individuals  with \ndisabilities  fully  enjoy  the  goods,  services,  privileges  and \nadvantages, available indiscriminately to other members of the \ngeneral public. \nId. at 20. \nSimilarly, the Seventh Circuit’s decision in Doe v. Mutual of Omaha involved a \nclaim that a medical insurer violated the ADA when it capped insurance benefits for \nmedical  care  for  AIDS  at  $25,000,  as  opposed  to  the  limit  of  $1,000,000  for  other \nconditions, in violation of the ADA. 179 F.3d at 558. The Doe court expressly relied on \nCarparts.  Id.  at  559.  The  Seventh  Circuit  explained  that  “[t]he  core  meaning  of \n[§ 12182(a)], plainly enough, is that the owner or operator of a store, hotel, restaurant, \n11 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 12 of 22\ndentist’s office, travel agency, theater, Web site, or other facility (whether in physical space \nor in electronic space . . .) that is open to the public cannot exclude disabled persons from \nentering  the  facility  and,  once  in,  from  using  the  facility  in  the  same  way  that  the \nnondisabled do.”  Id.  However,  the  Doe  court ultimately reversed the district court’s \nconclusion that the insurer’s policies violated Title III of the ADA because the statute does \nnot require an insurer to alter the products it sells—only to provide equal access to those \nproducts. See id. at 560–65. \nIn sum, while some appellate courts have found that Title III only applies physical \nstructures and others have disagreed, they all reached those conclusions in cases that did \nnot specifically consider whether Title III’s protections extend to website accessibility. \nC. District Court Decisions \nMore recently, district courts have been asked to decide whether websites are \nthemselves places of public accommodation under the ADA, and many have held that they \nare. E.g., Chalas v. Pork King Good, 673 F. Supp. 3d 339 (S.D.N.Y. 2023); Nat’l Ass’n of \nthe Deaf v. Netflix, Inc., 869 F. Supp. 2d 196 (D. Mass. 2012); Mejico v. Alba Web Designs, \nLLC, 515 F. Supp. 3d 424 (W.D. Va. 2021). \nIn Pork King Good, for example, the blind plaintiff alleged that the defendant sold \nproducts on its website in violation of Title III of the ADA because the website was not \naccessible for those that require the use of screen-reading software. 673 F. Supp. 3d at 341. \nThe court examined the state of the law regarding the need for a nexus between a physical \nplace and the plaintiff’s claims, and it found the statutory language ambiguous because \n“the statutory text—unsurprisingly in light of the ADA’s pre-Internet vintage—does not \n12 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 13 of 22\ncleanly resolve whether Title III applies to commercial websites.” Id. at 342–44 (cleaned \nup). The Court looked to the legislative history and purpose of the ADA and reasoned that \n“[a] holding today that limits places of public accommodation to the brick-and-mortar \nstandard would severely hamper Congress’ effort to protect disabled persons who want and \nneed access to the growing number of online-only providers of goods and services. Such \nan anomalous result could not have been Congress’ intention.” Id. at 344. \nIn  National  Association  of  the  Deaf  v.  Netflix  (“NATD”)  the  District  of \nMassachusetts reached a similar conclusion to the Pork King Good case using similar \nreasoning. In particular, the NATD court noted that “while . . . web-based services did not \nexist when the ADA was passed in 1990 and, thus, could not have been explicitly included \nin the Act, the legislative history of the ADA makes clear that Congress intended the ADA \nto adapt to changes in technology.” 869 F. Supp. 2d at 200–01 (citing H.R. Rep. 101–\n485(II), at 108 (1990), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 303, 391 (“The Committee intends that the types \nof accommodation and services provided to individuals with disabilities, under all of the \ntitles of this bill, should keep pace with the rapidly changing technology of the times.”)). \nThe court also observed that “Congress did not intend to limit the ADA to the specific \nexamples listed in each category of public accommodations,” and that the plaintiffs needed \nonly to show that the defendant’s “web site falls within a general category listed under the \nADA.” Id. (citing S. Rep. No. 116, at 59 (1990) (“Within each of these categories, the \nlegislation only lists a few examples and then, in most cases, adds the phrase ‘other similar’ \nentities. The Committee intends that the ‘other similar’ terminology should be construed \nliberally consistent with the intent of the legislation. . . .”); H.R. Rep. No. 485 (III), at 54 \n13 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 14 of 22\n(1990), 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 445, 477 (“A person alleging discrimination does not have to \nprove that the entity being charged with discrimination is similar to the examples listed in \nthe  definition.  Rather,  the  person  must  show  that  the  entity  falls  within  the  overall \ncategory.”)). The NATD court said that Netflix’s “watch instantly” streaming platform \nwould qualify either as a “‘service establishment’ in that it provides customers with the \nability  to  stream  video  programming  through  the  internet;  a  ‘place  of  exhibition  or \nentertainment’ in that it displays movies, television programming, and other content; and \na  ‘rental  establishment’  in  that  it  engages  customers  to  pay  for  the  rental  of  video \nprogramming.” Id. at 201.3 See also Chalas v. Barlean’s Organic Oils, LLC, No. 22 Civ \n04178 (CM), 2022 WL 17156838, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2022) (“I confess to being of \ntwo minds on this issue. The reasoning of the Circuit Courts of Appeal that have concluded \nthat Title III requires a nexus between the provision of services and some ‘place’ is \npersuasive, given that the statute requires a ‘place of public accommodation’ and the \nregulations promulgated thereunder refer only to physical locations. On the other hand, a \nwebsite is not inconsistent with the noun ‘place;’ a website is a location in the space known \nas the internet, and the word ‘place’ can be defined as a particular position or point (i.e., a \nlocation).”); Panarra v. HTC Corp., 598 F. Supp. 3d 73 (W.D.N.Y. 2022) (holding that a \ndeaf plaintiff adequately alleged that defendant’s online subscription services fell within \ncategories of public accommodations listed in Title III of the ADA and that defendant \nviolated the ADA by failing to offer closed captioning in its virtual reality programming). \n \n3 The NATD court is within the First Circuit and was therefore following the Carparts decision. \n14 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 15 of 22\nThe district court decisions are, however, not uniform, and other courts have held \nthat websites are not places of public accommodation covered by Title III of the ADA. \nE.g., Ariza v. Coffee Beanery, Ltd., 643 F. Supp. 3d 1334 (S.D. Fla. 2022); Cullen v. Netflix, \nInc., 880 F. Supp. 2d 1017 (N.D. Cal. 2012). The Ariza court observed the somewhat \nidiosyncratic development of this area of the law within the Eleventh Circuit, and found \nthat while the plaintiff’s complaint did not attempt to assert a claim that the defendant’s \nwebsite was itself a place of public accommodation, it did adequately allege that the \nwebsite acted as a nexus to the brick-and-mortar stores owned, operated, or controlled by \nthe defendants. 643 F. Supp. 3d at 1339. Meanwhile, the Cullen court applied the Ninth \nCircuit’s decision in  Weyer  and held that  Netflix’s website is not a place  of public \naccommodation because it is not an actual physical place. 880 F. Supp. 2d at 1023–24 \n(discussing similar decisions from other district courts within the Ninth Circuit). \nIII.  Analysis \nThe parties’ arguments understandably track the two distinct trends in the case \nlaw—Lion Brand prefers the cases requiring a physical location and the Frosts rely on those \nthat do not. Having considered the parties’ arguments, reviewed the relevant caselaw, and \nconsulted the rules of statutory interpretation, the Court holds that a website is a place of \npublic accommodation for purposes of Title III of the ADA. This question is not resolved \nby the plain language of the statute, and the Court recognizes that there are reasonable \n15 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 16 of 22\narguments supporting the interpretation advocated by both sides in this case.4 Nevertheless, \nthe Court rejects Lion Brand’s proposed construction and sides with the growing number \nof district courts that have found websites fall within the protection of Title III for the \nfollowing reasons. \nFirst, the Court is not persuaded that the outcome here is dictated by cases like \nParker, Ford, and Weyer. Aside from the fact that they are non-binding, none of those \ncases considered the issue before this Court—whether businesses are free to operate \nwebsites that deny disabled internet users equal access to the goods and services they offer \nbecause of the users’ disabilities. Indeed, Parker, Ford, and Weyer each involved the same \ndiscrete  issue—whether  Title  III’s  prohibition  on  discrimination  in  places  of  public \naccommodation  requires  a  long-term  disability  insurer  to  treat  mental  and  physical \ndisabilities the same in the terms of the insurance policy itself. True, in reaching the \nconclusion that Title III did not apply in that context, each of those decisions reasoned that \na public accommodation must be a place that has a “physical structure.” However, to \nconclude that Title III of the ADA does not apply to the content of insurance policies did \nnot require the sweeping conclusion that only physical structures are places of public \naccommodation. In other words, Parker, Ford, and Weyer would have come out the same \n \n4 E.g., Chalas v. Barlean’s Organic Oils, LLC, No. 22 Civ. 04178 (CM), 2022 WL 17156838, at \n*5 (S.D.N.Y. Nov. 22, 2022) (“I confess to being of two minds on this issue. The reasoning of the \nCircuit Courts of Appeal that have concluded that Title III requires a nexus between the provision \nof services and some ‘place’ is persuasive, given that the statute requires a ‘place of public \naccommodation’ and the regulations promulgated thereunder refer only to physical locations. On \nthe other hand, a website is not inconsistent with the noun ‘place;’ a website is a location in the \nspace known as the internet, and the word ‘place’ can be defined as a particular position or point \n(i.e., a location).”). \n16 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 17 of 22\nregardless of whether a Title III place of public accommodation is or is not limited to places \nthat have a “physical structure.” Cf. Sanzone v. Mercy Health, 954 F.3d 1031, 1039 \n(explaining that discussion “that is unnecessary to the decision in the case” is dicta). \nMoreover, even if the “physical structure”  conclusion from Parker, Ford, and \nWeyer were central to those cases’ holdings, this Court respectfully disagrees with such an \ninterpretation of the ADA. The Court finds they allowed the canon of noscitur a sociis to \nplay too great a role in their analysis. As the Supreme Court has observed, “[c]anons of \nconstruction need not be conclusive and are often countered . . . by some maxim pointing \nin a different direction.” Circuit City Stores, Inc. v. Adams, 532 U.S. 105, 115 (2001). They \nare “no more than a rule of thumb that can tip the scales when a statute could be read in \nmultiple ways.” Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Med. Ctr., 568 U.S. 145, 825–26 (2013) \n(cleaned up). Application of the noscitur a sociis canon alone would result in too narrow a \nreading  of  “public  accommodation,”  in  part,  because  the  physical-structures-only \nconstruction ignores the maxim that a remedial statute should be read broadly. See Craig \nv. Dep’t of Health, Ed. and Welfare, 581 F.2d 189, 193 (8th Cir. 1978) (stating that statutes \nhaving a remedial purpose should be construed liberally); Dolan v. U.S. Postal Serv., 546 \nU.S. 481, 486 (2006) (explaining that “a word in a statute may or may not extend to the \nlimits of its definitional possibilities” and that courts interpreting the term must consider \nits  surrounding  text  and  “the  purpose  and  context  of  the  statute”).  Further,  their \nconstruction also runs counter to ADA’s intent, which Congress enacted “to eliminate \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals, and to integrate them into the economic and \nsocial mainstream of American life” through a comprehensive law targeting widespread \n17 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 18 of 22\ndiscrimination. PGA Tour, 532 U.S. at 674–75; see also Carparts, 37 F.3d at 20 (discussing \nthe tension between a physical-structures limitation on Title III and the statute’s purpose \nand congressional intent). \nSecond, the relevant statutory language does not reflect congressional intent to limit \n“places of public accommodation” to locations with a “physical structure,” excluding \nplaces like websites from Title III’s coverage. The operative language of Title III prohibits \ndiscrimination that prevents a disabled individual from the “full and equal enjoyment of \nthe goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of \npublic accommodation. . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (emphasis added). Neither that text, nor \nthe  twelve  broad  categories  included  in  the  definition  of  public  accommodation  in \n§ 12181(7),  expressly  states  limits  on  the  places  where  disability  discrimination  is \nprohibited to those that are “physical structures.” Carparts, 37 F.3d at 20 (“Neither Title \nIII nor its implementing regulations make any mention of physical boundaries or physical \nentry.”). As the First Circuit recognized, the examples of “service establishments” in \n§ 12181(7)(F) often conduct their business in ways that do not “require[e] their customers \nto enter an office in order to obtain their services.” Id. at 19. \nThird, contrary to Lion Brand’s position, reference to dictionary definitions of the \nterm “place” does not resolve the question. Although contemporary dictionary definitions \ncan be useful in understanding the meaning of an undefined term in a statute, see, e.g., \nRiegelsberger v. Air Evac EMS, Inc., 970 F.3d 1061, 1064 (8th Cir. 2020), “[t]he definition \nof words in isolation . . . is not necessarily controlling in statutory construction,” Dolan, \n546 U.S. at 486. Here, the definitions of “place” found in dictionaries around the time of \n18 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 19 of 22\nthe ADA’s passage refer to buildings and other physical locations, but they do not suggest \nthat all places are necessarily physical structures. Indeed, during the years just before the \npassage of the ADA, “place” meant “a portion of space; an area with definite or indefinite \nboundaries,” “an area occupied by or set aside for a specific person or persons,” and a \n“business establishment or office.” The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Ed. \n946 (1985). Other dictionaries compiled similar ranges of definitions of which an office or \nbuilding was but one example. Webster’s Dictionary of the English Language, The New \nLexicon 767 (1987) (including “a particular part of space,” “position in space, or in some \nhierarchy,  scale, orderly arrangement,” “a building or area  appointed for a specified \npurpose”); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1478 (1987) (including \n“a particular portion of space, whether of definite or indefinite extent,” “space in general,” \nand “a building location, etc., set aside for a specific purpose”). Neither these dictionary \ndefinitions,  nor  the  list  of  examples  within  the  statutory  definition  of  “public \naccommodation”  resolves  conclusively  the  question  whether  a  “place  of  public \naccommodation” is limited to physical structures. Barlean’s Organic Oils, 2022 WL \n1716838, at *5 (“[A] website is not inconsistent with the noun ‘place;’ a website is a \nlocation in the space known as the internet, and the word ‘place’ can be defined as a \nparticular position or point (i.e., a location).”); see also Mejico v. Alba Web Designs, LLC, \n515 F. Supp. 3d 424, 435 (W.D. Va. 2021) (noting that in Packingham v. North Carolina, \n582 U.S. 98, 104 (2017), the Supreme Court “characterized ‘cyberspace’ as ‘the most \nimportant place[] for the exchange of views’”). \n19 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 20 of 22\nThis  reading  of  “place”  is  consistent  with  Congress’s  decision  to  prevent \ndiscrimination in “any place of public accommodation.” 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a) (emphasis \nadded); Andrews v. Blick Art Materials, LLC, 268 F. Supp. 3d 381, 393–94 (E.D.N.Y. \n2017) (reasoning that “the word ‘place’ was not intended to limit the statute’s reach, but \n‘that Congress likely used the word ‘place’ because there was no other less cumbersome \nway to describe businesses that offer those particular goods or services to the public’”) \n(quoting Nat’l Fed. of the Blind v. Scribd Inc., 97 F. Supp. 3d 565, 572 (D. Vt. 2015)). \nPreventing  discrimination  in  any  place  does  not  reflect  an  unstated  intent  to  allow \nbusinesses  to  deprive  disabled  individuals  equal  access  to  their  goods  and  services \nwhenever those businesses lack a brick-and-mortar store. \nIn addition, the Court finds that Title III’s legislative history supports the conclusion \nthat a stand-alone website like Lion Brand’s is a place of public accommodation. This is \ntrue even though the ADA was passed prior to the advent of the internet. See NATD, 869 \nF. Supp. 2d at 200–01. In fact, the legislative history reflects that: “Congress intended the \nADA to adapt to changes in technology”; and that the specific examples in § 12181(7) were \nintended  only  to  require  a  plaintiff  to  show  that  the  defendant’s  place  of  public \naccommodation “falls within a general category listed under the ADA.” Id.; see also \nCarparts,  37  F.3d  at  19–20  (explaining  that  the  Committee  Report  supported  an \ninterpretation that Congress was “concerned with access in the sense of either physical \naccess  to a place of  public accommodation or  something analogous, such as access \nprovided through telephone lines, messengers or some other medium”) (emphasis added). \n20 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 21 of 22\nIndeed, the stand-alone websites of today, where customers engage in an enormous \namount of interstate commerce,5 reasonably fall into one or more of the categories of public \naccommodations reflected in the statutory definition. This is especially true when one reads \nthose categories in the context of the injustice Title III of the ADA is meant to remedy. For \nexample, a website operating a store like Lion Brand’s is not meaningfully different from \na physical “shopping center,” and is functionally a “sales or rental establishment”6 when it \ncomes to the need for disabled persons to have equal access. A brick-and-mortar sales \nestablishment can discriminatorily prevent  disabled persons from gaining meaningful \naccess to its goods and services by failing to install ramps for wheelchair access or omitting \nbraille signage to allow vision-impaired customers to find public restrooms. In similar \nways, online sales establishments that fail to maintain websites that can be navigated by \nthose who are blind or visually impaired prohibit these customers from gaining equal \naccess to their goods and services because they cannot navigate those websites even when \nusing screen-reader technology. Morgan v. Joint Admin. Bd., Ret. Plan of the Pillsbury Co. \nand Am. Fed’n of Grain Millers, AFL-CIO-CLC, 268 F.3d 456, 459 (7th Cir. 2001) (“The \nsite of the sale is irrelevant to Congress’s goal of granting the disabled equal access to \nsellers of goods and services. What matters is that the good or service be offered to the \npublic.”). \n \n5 Mejico v. Alba Web Designs, LLC, 515 F. Supp. 3d 424, 434 (W.D. Va. 2021) (“‘[W]e shop in \nvirtual marketplaces for everything from luxuries to necessities,’ and ‘we now rely even more on \nonline shopping in the recent pandemic.’”) (quoting Lebamoff Enters. Inc. v. Whitmer, 956 F.3d \n863, 875, 878 (6th Cir. 2020) (McKeague, J., concurring)). \n \n6 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7)(E). \n21 \n \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 36     Filed 02/06/25     Page 22 of 22\nThe Court is also not convinced by Lion Brand’s suggestion that the absence of any \namendment  of  the  ADA  since  the  advent  of  web-based  commerce  is  indicative  of \nCongressional intent to exclude websites from Title III’s coverage. Construing a statute by \nreference to post-enactment legislative silence is a fraught enterprise that rarely yields clear \nanswers.  2B  Sutherland  Statutory  Construction,  Legislative  inaction  following \ncontemporaneous and practical interpretation § 49:9 (7th ed.) (describing “legislative \ninaction” as “a weak reed upon which to lean and a poor beacon to follow to construe a \nstatute”). Here, in the years since the internet has become a place where customers engage \nin significant commerce, the fact that the ADA has not been amended to expressly include \nwebsites  in  the  list  of  places  of  public  accommodation  could  just  as  easily  reflect \nCongress’s understanding that no amendment was necessary. \nFor these reasons, the Court finds that Lion Brand’s stand-alone website falls within \nthe meaning of a “place of public accommodation” as defined in Title III of the ADA. \nORDER \nFor the reasons set forth above, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT Defendant’s \nMotion to Dismiss is DENIED. \n \nDate: February 6, 2025  s/Katherine Menendez \n  Katherine Menendez \nUnited States District Judge \n \n22 \n ",

This case arises because Defendant’s Website (www.lionbrand.com) (the \n“Website” or “Defendant’s Website”) is not fully and equally accessible to people who are \nblind or who have low vision in violation of both the general non-discriminatory mandate \nand the effective communication and auxiliary aids and services requirements of the \nAmericans  with  Disabilities  Act  42  U.S.C.  §  12181,  et  seq.  (the  “ADA”)  and  its \nimplementing regulations. In addition to the claim under the ADA, Plaintiffs also assert a \ncompanion cause of action under the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA). Plaintiffs \nseek a permanent injunction requiring a change in Defendant’s corporate policies to cause \nits online store to become, and remain, accessible to individuals with visual disabilities; a \ncivil penalty payable to the state of Minnesota pursuant to Minn. Stat. 363A.33, Subd. 6 \nand Minn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023); damages, and a damage multiplier pursuant to \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and Minn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023). \n2.  As the National Federation of the Blind has explained: \n   \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 2 of 26\nIn many ways, individuals with disabilities rely on Web content more so than their \nnondisabled peers because of inherent transportation, communication, and other \nbarriers. A blind person does not have the same autonomy to drive to a covered \nentity’s office as a sighted person. A deaf or hard-of-hearing person does not have \nthe same opportunity to call a covered entity’s office. A person with an intellectual \ndisability does not have the same ability to interact independently with the staff at a \ncovered  entity’s  office.  The  24-hour-a-day  availability  of  information  and \ntransactions  on  covered  entity  Websites  and  mobile  apps  provides  a  level  of \nindependence and convenience that cannot be replicated through any other means. \nThat is why the number of Americans who rely on the Internet has increased year \nafter year and why entities offer information and transactions through that unique \nmedium. \n \nSee Comment from disability rights organizations to DOJ Supplemental Advance Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability; Accessibility of \nWeb Information and Services of State and Local Government Entities,” C RT Docket No \n128, RIN 119 -AA65, Answer 57 (October 7, 2016) (citations omitted). \n \n3.  Plaintiffs, on behalf of themselves and others who are similarly situated, seek \nrelief  including an injunction requiring  Defendant to  make its  Website accessible to \nPlaintiffs and the putative class; and requiring Defendant to adopt sufficient policies, \npractices, and procedures, the details of which are more fully described below, to ensure \nthat Defendant’s Website remains accessible in the future. Plaintiffs also seek an award of \nstatutory attorney’s fees and costs, damages, a damages multiplier, a civil penalty, and such \nother relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \n4.  The injunctive relief  that Plaintiffs seek will inure to the benefit of an \nestimated 2.3 percent of the United States population who reports having a visual disability. \nSee Erickson, W., Lee, C., von Schrader, S., Disability Statistics from the American \nCommunity  Survey  (ACS),  Cornell  University  Yang-Tan  Institute  (YTI), \nwww.disabilitystatistics.org (last accessed Apr. 12, 2022). \n  2 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 3 of 26\n5.  It will also benefit Defendant, who will extend its market reach to this \npopulation. See Sharron Rush, The Business Case for Digital Accessibility, W3C Web \nAccessibility  Initiative  (Nov.  9,  2018),  https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/  (last \naccessed Apr. 12, 2022) (“The global market of people with disabilities is over 1 billion \npeople with a spending power of more than $6 trillion. Accessibility often improves the \nonline experience for all users.”). \nPRELIMINARY FACTS \n6.  In a September 25, 2018, letter to U.S. House of Representative Ted Budd, \nU.S. Department of Justice Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd confirmed that \npublic accommodations must make the Website they own, operate, or control equally \naccessible  to  individuals  with  disabilities.  Assistant  Attorney  General  Boyd’s  letter \nprovides: \nThe Department [of Justice] first articulated its interpretation that the ADA \napplies  to  public  accommodations’  Website  over  20  years  ago.  This \ninterpretation is consistent with the ADA’s title III requirement that the \ngoods,  services,  privileges,  or  activities  provided  by  places  of  public \naccommodation be equally accessible to people with disabilities. \nSee Letter from Assistant Attorney General Stephen E. Boyd, U.S. Department of Justice, \nto Congressman Ted Budd, U.S. House of Representatives (Sept. 25, 2018). \n \n7.  Plaintiffs and the members of the putative class are blind and low-vision \nindividuals and are reliant upon screen reader technology to navigate the Internet. \n8.  Screen  reader  “software  translates  the  visual  internet  into  an  auditory \nequivalent. At a rapid pace, the software reads the content of a webpage to the user.” \n  3 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 4 of 26\nAndrews  v.  Blick  Art  Materials,  LLC,  286  F.Supp.3d  365,  374  (E.D.N.Y.  2017)  (J. \nWeinstein). \nThe screen reading software uses auditory cues to allow a visually impaired \nuser to effectively use Websites. For example, when using the visual internet, \na seeing user learns that a link may be “clicked,” which will bring her to \nanother webpage, through visual cues, such as a change in the color of the \ntext (often text is turned from black to blue). When the sighted user's cursor \nhovers over the link, it changes from an arrow symbol to a hand. \nThe screen reading software uses auditory—rather than visual—cues to relay \nthis same information. When a sight-impaired individual reaches a link that \nmay be “clicked on,” the software reads the link to the user, and after reading \nthe text of the link says the word “clickable.” … Through a series of auditory \ncues read aloud by the screen reader, the visually impaired user can navigate \na Website by listening and responding with her keyboard. \n9.  Web-based technologies have features and content that are modified on a \ndaily, and in some instances on an hourly basis. As a result, a one-time “fix” to an \ninaccessible  Website  will  not  cause  the  Website  to  remain  accessible  without  a \ncorresponding  change  in  corporate  policies  related  to  those  web-based  technologies. \nJonathan Lazur et al., Ensuring Digital Accessibility Through Process and Policy 140 \n(2015).  \n10.  As one leading commentator notes, \nThe most significant problem is maintaining the accessibility of a large \ncommercial site. Without policies, procedures, and metrics—such as testing \na release for accessibility before posting to the Website and training in \naccessible design (so that accessibility is part of the design process the way, \nsay, cybersecurity is)—the site’s status as accessible will be temporary at \nbest.  \n \n  4 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 5 of 26\nSee Fighting for Accessible Website under the ADA: Daniel Goldstein, Brown \nGoldstein  Levy,  Baltimore,  Bloomberg  BNA,  Jan.  13,  2016,  ISSN  1098-5190 \n(reproduced with permission from Electronic Commerce & Law Report, 21 ECLR, \n2, 1/13/16)  \n11.  To evaluate whether an inaccessible Website has been rendered accessible \nand whether corporate policies related to web-based technologies have been changed in a \nmeaningful manner that will cause the Website to remain accessible, the Website must be \nreviewed on a periodic basis using both automated accessibility screening tools, manual \nand end-user testing by disabled individuals. \n[I]f you have planned to redesign or add a certain segment to your site, then \nmake it accessible from the start. It’s far cheaper to plan for an elevator than \nto decide to add one once your 30-story building is complete. Or if you are \nre-branding, consider using templates that will ensure accessibility. Make \nsure you have policies, procedures, and metrics in place so that you know if \nyou are maintaining accessibility and can identify why, if you are not. Most \nof  all,  consult  disabled  consumers  or  a  consumer  organization  before \ndeciding what you are going to do and have consumers actually test the \nchanges.  \nSomething you imagine you may need to do, you may not need to do at all, \nor may be able to do much cheaper. Something you hadn’t thought to do may \nbe critical to accessibility. And, of course, if you work with the disability \ncommunity, they will spread the word that this is no longer a site to be \navoided, but to be used. \nId. at 3. \n12.  “As technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, it is important to consider \nfactors  that  can  facilitate  or  impede  technology  adoption  and  use  by  people  with \ndisabilities.” National Disability Policy: A Progress Report, Nat’l Council on Disability \n(Oct. 7, 2016), https://ncd.gov/sites/default/files/NCD_ProgressReport_ES_508.pdf. \n  5 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 6 of 26\n13.  This is especially true with respect to accessing goods and services over the \ninternet, where people with disabilities stand to benefit immensely if online services are \nfully and equally accessible to them.  \n14.  When digital content is properly formatted, it is universally accessible to \neveryone. When it’s not, the content provider fails to communicate with individuals with a \nvisual disability effectively. In turn, these individuals must expend additional time and \neffort to overcome communication barriers not applicable to sighted users, which may \nrequire the assistance of third parties or, in some instances, deny outright access to the \nonline service.  \n15.  Such difficulties often lead disabled individuals to abandon the process of \npurchasing items online after they begin. See Kasey Wehrum, Your Website is Scaring \nCustomers  Away.  5  Easy  Ways  to  Fix  It.,  Inc.  Mag.  (Jan.  2014), \nhttps://www.inc.com/magazine/201312/kasey-wehrum/how-to-getonline-customers-to-\ncomplete-purchase.html  (documenting  the  most  common  causes  of  shopping  cart \nabandonment, including: “Your Checkout button is hard to find[,]” “Shoppers question the \nsafety of their personal info[,]” and “Getting through the checkout process takes multiple \nclicks.”). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  The claims alleged arise under Title III such that this Court’s jurisdiction is \ninvoked pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 42 U.S.C. § 12188.  \n17.   Defendant  purposefully  avails  itself  of  the  benefits  and  advantages  of \noperating an interactive, online business open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a \n  6 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 7 of 26\nyear which, through its Website, enters into contracts for the sale of its products with \nresidents of Minnesota and participates in the State of Minnesota’s economy by offering \nand providing services over the internet to Minnesota residents, including Plaintiffs.   \n18.  Venue in this District is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) because this is \nthe judicial district in which a substantial part of the acts and omissions giving rise to \nPlaintiff’s claims occurred. As described in additional detail below, Plaintiffs were injured \nwhen they attempted to access Defendant’s Website from Minnesota but encountered \nbarriers that denied them full and equal access to Defendant’s online goods, content, and \nservices. \nPARTIES \n19.  Plaintiffs  are  and,  at  all  times  relevant  hereto,  have  been  residents  of \nMinnesota. \n20.  Plaintiffs are and, at all times relevant hereto, have been legally blind and are \ntherefore disabled under the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2), and the regulations implementing \nthe ADA set forth at 28 CFR §§ 36.101 et seq.   \n21.  Defendant Lion Brand Yarn Company is a New Jersey-based Company and \nis headquartered at 135 Kero Road, Carlstadt, NJ 07072.  \n22.  Upon information and belief, Defendant is the oldest producer of knitting and \ncraft yarn in the United States. \n23.  Upon information and belief, Defendant's website was first launched in 1996 \nand most recently had 1.13 million United States visitors to its website in the month of \n  7 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 8 of 26\nFebruary  2024.  Semrush,  https://www.semrush.com/website/lionbrand.com/overview/ \n(last visited March 14, 2024). \nADDITIONAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS  \n24.  Defendant’s mission is “To spread warmth comfort, and inspiration to the \nworld by providing products and social engagement that promote the joy of knitting, \ncrocheting, and weaving.” Defendant claims to be “one of the leading distributors of \nknitting and craft yarn in the United States and other countries.” In order to browse, \nresearch, or shop online and purchase the products and services that Defendant offers, \nindividuals may visit Defendant’s Website, where Defendant makes its products available \nfor  sale  to  the  public.  Defendant  and/or  Defendant’s  Website  is  a  place  of  public \naccommodation. \n25.  Defendant owns, operates, and/or controls its Website and is responsible for \nthe  policies,  practices,  and  procedures  concerning  the  Website’s  development  and \nmaintenance. Defendant and/or Defendant’s Website is a place of public accommodation. \n26.  Plaintiff Tammy Frost has, for thirty or so years, been a knitter. Over the \ncourse of the years, she has knitted a variety of things such as scarves, blankets, and baby \nblankets, etc.  \n27.  On occasion, Plaintiff Tammy Frost has come across a particular knitting \nproject that either calls for or suggests obtaining the yarn from Defendant or that Defendant \nhas the necessary yarn available. \n28.  On many occasions, Plaintiff Tammy Frost has purchased Defendant’s yarn \nfrom certain stores such as Joann Fabrics. \n  8 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 9 of 26\n29.  Plaintiff Tammy Frost has also visited Defendant’s Website on a number of \noccasions in connection with her interest in knitting, to browse and determine if Defendant \nhad  yarn  for  purchase  that  would  suit  her  needs  and  for  the  purpose  of  purchasing \nDefendant’s yarn. \n30.  Plaintiff Tammy Frost recalls at least three separate occasions when she \nvisited Defendant’s Website, encountered difficulties, and was unable to complete her \nintended  purchase  independently  because  Defendant’s  Website  conveyed  confusing, \ndisorienting and non-sensical information to her screen-reader.  \n31.  Plaintiff Tammy Frost does not have eyes and is completely blind. Her \nhusband, Plaintiff Clarence Frost, has severe low vision. They are both dependent on the \nuse of screen reader technology to navigate the internet. Neither of them, independently or \ntogether, could or has ever been able to navigate and understand Defendant’s Website or \ncomplete an online purchase of yarn from it without assistance. \n32.  As  a  consequence  of  their  experience  visiting  Defendant’s  Website, \nincluding in the past year, the Plaintiffs’ brought the Website to the attention of the \nundersigned counsel. Counsel completed both automated and manual audits of the Website, \nall of which confirmed Plaintiffs’ description of their user experience and that the Website \ndid not afford individuals who are dependent upon screen-reader technology a full, equal, \nand  independent  opportunity  to  enjoy  a  user  experience  equal  to  that  available  to \nDefendant’s sighted customers, and failed to ensure effective communication with screen-\nreader-dependent users through the provision of accessible electronic and information \ntechnology.   For example: \n  9 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 10 of 26\na.  Defendant’s Website fails to alert screen readers to pop-up window content \nsuch as a “Subscribe and Save $15% on Your Next Order” opportunity and \ninstead  conveys  non-sensical,  confusing,  and  disorienting  information. \nInstead,  screen  reader  technology  narrates  the  content  of  the  Website’s \nunderlying page. As a result, pop-up content Defendant deems sufficiently \nimportant to convey to its sighted Website visitors is completely unavailable \nto screen reader users; \n \nb.  The  Website  does  not  provide  sufficient  screen  reader-accessible  text \nequivalent for important non-text image(s) such as various color swatch \nchoices of yarn for sale. People who are blind will not be able to understand \nthe content and purpose of images, such as pictures, illustrations, and charts \nwhen no text alternative is provided. Text alternatives convey the purpose of \nan image, including pictures, illustrations, charts, etc.;  \n \nc.  Defendant’s  Website  has  inaccessible  unordered  drop-down  menu  lists \nwhich are unrecognized by screen reader technology. Users who depend on \nscreen  reader  technology  should  know  if  and  when  unordered  lists  are \npresented and available for viewing; and \n \nd.  Defendant’s Website conveys information visually and via color as the only \nmeans of conveying information and without audible narration, including \nsales  prices  that  have  been  reduced  from  $5.99  to  $4.19”  making  the \ninformation unavailable to screen reader users. \n \n33.   Still,  Plaintiffs  would  like  to,  intend  to,  and  will  attempt  to  access \nDefendant’s Website in the future to browse, research, or shop online and fully intends to \ncontinue their practice of purchasing the products and services that Defendant offers from \ntime to time. Plaintiffs, and other knitters who purchase yarn, typically do not know or \nhave a plan in place to purchase yarn on a specific date in the future. Instead, they purchase \nyarn on an as needed basis, depending on the nature of the particular knitting project that \nis going to be undertaken.  \n  10 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 11 of 26\n34.  Defendant’s policies regarding the maintenance and operation of its Website \nfail to ensure its Website is fully accessible to, and independently usable by, individuals \nwith vision-related disabilities.  \n35.  Plaintiffs and the putative class have been, and in the absence of injunctive \nrelief will continue to be, injured, and discriminated against by Defendant’s failure to \nprovide its online Website content and services in a manner that is compatible with screen \nreader technology. \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n36.  Plaintiffs bring this action pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) and 23(b)(2), \nindividually and on behalf of the following class:  \nAll blind or have a low vision disability within the meaning of the ADA who use \nscreen  reader  auxiliary  aids  to  navigate  digital  online  content  and  who  have \naccessed, attempted to access, or who may access or attempt to access Defendant’s \nWebsite. \n \n37.  This  action  is  a  prototypical  civil-rights  action  of  the  kind  expressly \ncontemplated for class-certification by the draftsman of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The note \nto the 1966 amendment to Rule 23 states: “Subdivision (b)(2). This subdivision is intended \nto reach situations where a party has taken action or refused to take action with respect to \na class, and final relief of an injunctive nature or a corresponding declaratory nature, \nsettling the legality of the behavior with respect to the class as a whole, is appropriate. . . \nIllustrative are various actions in the civil rights filed where a party is charged with \ndiscriminating unlawfully against a class, usually one whose members are incapable of \nspecific enumeration.” See also, Newberg on Class Actions § 4:40 (5th ed. 2014) (“The \n  11 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 12 of 26\ntypes of civil rights cases that have often been certified as (b)(2) class actions include . . . \ndisability discrimination actions under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).”). \nNUMEROSITY \n38.  The class described above is so numerous that joinder of all individual \nmembers in one action would be impracticable.  \n39.  According to the United States Department of Justice: “The U.S. Census \nBureau’s 2002 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) found that there are \n51.2 million people with disabilities in the United States . . . Millions of people with \ndisabilities  regularly  travel,  shop,  and  eat  out  with  family  and  friends  .  .  .  The \nAdministration on Aging projects that by 2030 there will be more than 69 million people \nage 65 and older, making up approximately 20% of the total U.S. population. The large \nand growing market of people with disabilities has $175 billion in discretionary spending, \nAARP says that four million Americans turn 50 each year and that people age 50 and older \nspent nearly $400 billion in 2003. At age 50, adults are likely to experience age-related \nphysical changes that may affect hearing, vision, cognition, and mobility.” \n40.  According to the American Foundation for the Blind, an estimated 32.2 \nmillion adult Americans (or about 13% of all adult Americans) reported they either \"have \ntrouble\" seeing, even when wearing glasses or contact lenses, or that they are blind or \nunable to see at all. \n41.  According to The National Federation of the Blind, the number of non-\ninstitutionalized individuals reported to have a visual disability in the United States in 2016 \nis 7,675,600 -- 86,500 of whom reside in Minnesota. \n  12 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 13 of 26\n42.  According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the number of people \nwith visual impairment or blindness in the United States is expected to double to more than \n8 million by 2050, according to projections based on the most recent census data and from \nstudies funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. \nAnother 16.4 million Americans are expected to have difficulty seeing due to correctable \nrefractive errors such as myopia (nearsightedness) or hyperopia (farsightedness) that can \nbe fixed with glasses, contacts, or surgery. \n43.  According to the United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention \n(CDC), Vision disability is one of the top 10 disabilities among adults 18 years and older. \n  44.  An estimated 2.3 percent of the United States population reports having a \nvisual disability. See Erickson, W., Lee, C., von Schrader, S., Disability Statistics from the \nAmerican  Community  Survey  (ACS),  Cornell  University  Yang-Tan  Institute  (YTI), \nwww.disabilitystatistics.org (last accessed Apr. 12, 2022). \n45.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has documented consumers’ increasing \nreliance on the Internet to shop online: \nThe average consumer spends more than $1,700 per year on online shopping, a \nnumber that’s continuing to rise. The convenience, affordability, and ability to \ncompare prices with ease has led more and more customers to visit e-commerce \nsites before heading to a brick-and-mortar location.  \n \nSee Emily Heaslip, A Guide to Building an Online Store, U.S. Chamber of Commerce \n(Sept. 20, 2019), https://www.uschamber.com/co/start/startup/how-to-build-online-stores. \n \n46.  Researchers have determined that: 95% of consumers will buy at least half \nof their gifts online. The Leanplum survey found that 80% of respondents shop on their \nmobile devices.  See Emily Heaslip, Ways to Optimize Your E-Commerce Site for Mobile \n  13 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 14 of 26\nShopping,  U.S.  Chamber  of  Commerce  (Jan.  6,  2020), \nhttps://www.uschamber.com/co/run/technology/building-mobilefriendly-commerce-\nWebsites. \n47.

See Sharron Rush, The Business Case for Digital Accessibility, W3C Web \nAccessibility Initiative (Nov. 9, 2018), https://www.w3.org/WAI/business-case/  \n49.  These facts easily permit a common-sense inference that the numerosity \nrequirement has been met in this matter. \n50.  In addition, Plaintiffs anticipate that the record evidence gathered during \ndiscovery will further demonstrate that Rule 23(a)(1) has been satisfied in this matter.  \nTYPICALITY \n51.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of the members of the classes. The \nclaims of Plaintiffs and members of the classes are all based on the same legal theory and \nall arise from the same unlawful conduct. Plaintiffs and the class members all have the \nsame grievance and are all entitled to the same relief. \n52.  Plaintiffs’ interests align with the interests of the putative classes because \nthey and each class member seek injunctive relief requiring Defendant to make changes to \n  14 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 15 of 26\nits existing Website and related policies, practices, and procedures in order to ensure \nDefendant’s Website becomes and remain ADA compliant, relief that would benefit all \nmembers of the proposed classes. \nCOMMON QUESTIONS OF FACT AND LAW \n53.  There  are  factual  and  legal  issues  common  to  Plaintiffs  and  all  class \nmembers. As explained herein, Defendant’s Website violates the ADA, and Defendant's \npolicies, practices, and procedures fail to ensure that its Website does not discriminate \nagainst people who are blind or have low vision within the meaning of the ADA. And this \nCourt can remedy Defendant’s violation of the ADA by issuing an injunction requiring \nchanges to Defendant’s Website and to its related policies, practices, and procedures. \nAccordingly, “there are questions of law or fact common to the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a)(2), including: \na.  Whether Defendant’s Website fails to provide individuals who are blind or \nhave low vision with the appropriate auxiliary aids and services necessary to \nensure effective communication with individuals with disabilities who rely \non scree-reader technology in violation of Title III of the ADA and its \nimplementing regulations and the MHRA; \n \nb.  Whether Defendant’s Website-related policies, practices, and procedures \ndiscriminate against Plaintiffs and putative class members in violation of \nTitle III of the ADA and its implementing regulations and the MHRA; and \n \nc.  What measures are available to remedy the concerns of Plaintiffs and the \nputative class. \n \n54.  Whether  and  to  what  extent  Defendant’s  Website  and  related  policies, \npractices, and procedures are unlawful presents a common question with only one answer: \nDefendant’s Website and related policies, procedures, and practices either violate the ADA \n  15 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 16 of 26\nand the MHRA or they do not. If Defendant’s Website and related policies, procedures, \nand practices are discriminatory, then each class member is entitled to injunctive relief. On \nthe other hand, if the Website and related policies, procedures, and practices do not violate \nthe ADA and the MHRA, then no class member is entitled to injunctive relief. Either way, \nthis proceeding will generate a common answer, the determination of which “will resolve \nan issue… central to the validity of each one [of the class members’] claims in one stroke.” \nWal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011). \nADEQUACY OF REPRESENTATION \n55.  Plaintiffs will fairly, adequately, and vigorously represent and protect the \ninterests of the members of the class and have no interests antagonistic to the members of \nthe  class.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  counsel  who  is  competent  and  experienced  in  the \nprosecution of class action litigation and who possesses substantial ADA expertise. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nVIOLATION OF TITLE III OF THE ADA \n56.  In the broadest terms, the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of a \ndisability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods and services of any place of public \naccommodation. 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). Thus, to the extent Defendant does not provide \nPlaintiffs with full and equal access to its Website, it has violated the ADA’s general non-\ndiscriminatory mandate.  \n57.  Specific provisions within the ADA require,  inter alia, that “[a]  public \naccommodation shall furnish appropriate auxiliary aids and services where necessary to \n  16 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 17 of 26\nensure  effective  communication  with  individuals  with  disabilities.”  28  C.F.R.  § \n36.303(c)(1).  \n58.  The regulations set forth numerous examples of “auxiliary aids and services,” \nincluding “… accessible electronic and information technology; or other effective methods \nof making visually delivered materials available to individuals who are blind or have low \nvision.” 28 C.F.R. § 36.303(b).  \n59.   Auxiliary aids and services include but are not limited to, audio recordings, \nscreen  reader  software,  magnification  software,  optical  readers,  secondary  auditory \nprograms, large print materials, accessible electronic and information technology, and \nother effective methods of making visually delivered materials available to individuals who \nare  blind  or  have  low  vision,  and  other  similar  services  and  actions.  28  C.F.R.  §§ \n36.303(b)(2), (4).  \n60.  The term “auxiliary aids and services” also includes the “[a]cquisition or \nmodification of equipment or devices; and [o]ther similar services and actions.” Id. \n61.  The ADA Title III regulations further require that “[i]n order to be effective, \nauxiliary aids and services must be provided in accessible formats, in a timely manner, and \nin  such  a  way  as  to  protect  the  privacy  and  independence  of  the  individual  with  a \ndisability.” Id. (emphasis added).  \n62.  The House Committee on Education and Labor stated that it intended “that \nthe types of accommodation and services provided to individuals with disabilities, under \nall of the titles of this bill, should keep pace with the rapidly changing technology of the \ntimes,” and that technological advances “may require public accommodations to provide \n  17 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 18 of 26\nauxiliary aids and services in the future which today would not be required because they \nwould be held to impose undue burdens on such entities.” H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at \n108 (1990).   \n63.  Similarly, the United States Department of Justice, in promulgating the rules \nimplementing Title III in 1991, explained that it was “not possible to provide an exhaustive \nlist [of auxiliary aids and services], and such an attempt would omit new devices that will \nbecome available with emerging technology.” 28 C.F.R. pt. 36, App. C, p. 912 (discussion \nof § 36.303). \n64.  As the Ninth Circuit has explained, “assistive technology is not frozen in \ntime: as technology advances, [ ] accommodations should advance as well.” Enyart v. Nat'l \nConference of Bar Examiners, Inc., 630 F.3d 1153, 1163 (9th Cir. 2011). \n65.   By failing to provide its Website’s content and services in a manner that is \ncompatible with auxiliary aids, Defendant has engaged, directly, or through contractual, \nlicensing, or other arrangements, in illegal disability discrimination, as defined by Title III, \nincluding without limitation:  \na.  denying individuals with visual disabilities opportunities to participate in and \nbenefit from the goods, content, and services available on its Website;  \n \nb.  affording individuals with visual disabilities access to its Website that is not \nequal to, or effective as, that afforded others;  \n \nc.  utilizing methods of administration that (i) have the effect of discriminating \non the basis of disability; or (ii) perpetuate the discrimination of others who \nare subject to common administrative control; \n \nd.  denying individuals with visual disabilities effective communication, thereby \nexcluding or otherwise treating them differently than others; and/or  \n \n  18 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 19 of 26\ne.  failing to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures \nwhere  necessary  to  afford  its  services,  privileges,  advantages,  or \naccommodations to individuals with visual disabilities. \n \n66.   Defendant has violated Title III by, without limitation, failing to make its \nWebsite’s services accessible by screen reader programs, thereby denying individuals with \nvisual disabilities the benefits of the Website, providing them with benefits that are not \nequal to those it provides others, and denying them effective communication.  \n67.   Defendant has further violated Title III by, without limitation, utilizing \nadministrative methods, practices, and policies that allow its Website to be made available \nwithout consideration of consumers who can only access the company’s online goods, \ncontent, and services with screen reader programs.  \n68.   Defendant’s ongoing violations of Title III have caused, and in the absence \nof an injunction will continue to cause, harm to Plaintiffs and other individuals with visual \ndisabilities.   \n69.   Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12188 and the remedies, procedures, and rights set \nforth and incorporated therein, Plaintiffs request relief as set forth below. \nVIOLATION OF THE MHRA \n70.  Minn. Stat. § 363A.11 provides: It is an unfair discriminatory practice: (1) to \ndeny any person the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \nadvantages, and accommodations of a place of public accommodation because of […] \ndisability  […];  or  (2)  for  a  place  of  public  accommodation  not  to  make  reasonable \naccommodation to the known physical, sensory, or mental disability of a disabled person. \n  19 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 20 of 26\n71.  Under the general prohibitions established by the MHRA, Minn. Stat. § \n363A.11, subd. 2 (2023), it is unlawful discrimination to deny individuals with disabilities \nan opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, privileges, \nadvantages,  or  accommodations  that  is  equal  to  the  opportunities  afforded  to  other \nindividuals. \n72.  Defendant has engaged in unfair discriminatory practices against Plaintiffs \nand others in that it has failed to ensure that Defendant’s Website and online content is \nfully accessible to persons with disabilities on an independent and equal basis in violation \nof the MHRA, and Minn. Stat. § 363A.11 (2023). \n73.  Plaintiffs have been denied full and equal access to the Website and have \nbeen denied the opportunity to participate in or benefit from the goods, services, facilities, \nprivileges, advantages, or accommodations offered therein on a full, independent, and \nequal basis. \n74.  Plaintiffs are without adequate remedy at law, have suffered and are suffering \nirreparable harm. \n75.  This Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 3-4 (2023), to issue an order directing Defendant to cease and \ndesist from their unfair discriminatory practices and to take affirmative action to make its \nWebsite readily accessible to and independently usable by individuals with disabilities.  \n76.  The Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023), to order Defendant to pay a civil penalty to the state \nof Minnesota.  \n  20 \n\nCASE 0:24-cv-00950-KMM-LIB     Doc. 23     Filed 07/12/24     Page 21 of 26\n77.  The Court has authority under Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd. 6 (2023), and \nMinn. Stat. § 363A.29, subd. 4 (2023), to award damages, and a damage multiplier \npursuant. \n78.  Plaintiffs  have  retained  the  undersigned  counsel  for  the  filing  and \nprosecution of this action and are entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees from \nDefendant as part of the costs, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 363A.33, subd.7 (2023). \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request judgment as follows: \n(A)  An  order  certifying  the  proposed  Class,  appointing  Plaintiffs  as \nrepresentatives of the proposed Class, and appointing undersigned counsel \nas counsel for the proposed Class; \n(B)  A Declaratory Judgment that at the commencement of this action Defendant \nwas  in  violation  of  the  specific  requirements  of  Title  III  of  the  ADA \ndescribed above, and the relevant implementing regulations of the ADA, and \nthe MHRA, in that Defendant took no action that was reasonably calculated \nto ensure Defendant communicated the digital content of its Digital Platform \nto individuals with disabilities effectively such that Plaintiffs could fully, \nequally, and independently access Defendant’s products and services; \n(C)   A permanent injunction pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(2) and 28 CFR § \n36.504(a) and Minn.
