Defendants' unlawful acts include violent attacks on Energy Transfer \nemployees and property, soliciting money for and providing funding to support these illegal \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 5 of 78\nattacks, inciting protests to disrupt construction, and a vast, malicious publicity campaign against \nEnergy Transfer.  All the while, Defendants utilized the anti-DAPL platform to raise tens of \nmillions of dollars in donations from the public under the guise of concern over indigenous \npeoples' rights. \n[113]  The conduct and harm alleged here has been described by the U.S. District Court \nfor  the District of North  Dakota as \"mindless and senseless criminal  mayhem\" that is not \nprotected by the rights of free speech and assembly: \nWith respect to the assertion the movement has been a peaceful protest, one need \nonly turn on a television set or read any newspaper in North Dakota.  There the \nviewer will find countless videos and photographs of the \"peaceful\" protestors \nattaching  themselves  to  construction  equipment  operated  by  Dakota  Access; \nvandalizing and defacing construction equipment; trespassing on privately-owned \nproperty; obstructing work on the pipeline; and verbally taunting, harassing, and \nshowing disrespect to members of the law enforcement community. . . . The \nestimated damage to construction equipment and loss of work on the project is far \nin excess of several million dollars. . . . To suggest that all of the protest activities \nto date have been \"peaceful\" and law-abiding defies commonsense and reality. \nDakota Access,  LLC v.  Archambault, No. 1:16-cv-296,  2016  WL  5107005, at  *2  (D.N.D. \nSept. 16, 2016). \n[¶4]  Defendants thus advanced their extremist agenda -- to attack and disrupt Energy \nTransfer's business and its construction of DAPL -- through means far outside the bounds of \ndemocratic  political  action,  protest,  and  peaceful,  legally  protected  expression  of  dissent. \nInstead, Defendants pursued \"militant direct action\" -- in the words of Defendant Two Bulls --\nincluding trespass onto Energy Transfer's private property; violent and destructive attacks on \nEnergy Transfer construction equipment and other private property; arson; and intimidation, \nharassment, and assault of Energy Transfer employees. \n[¶5]  Defendants  also  engaged  in  large-scale,  intentional  dissemination  of \nmisinformation  and  outright  falsehoods  regarding  Energy  Transfer,  DAPL's  environmental \n2 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 6 of 78\nimpact, and Energy Transfer's extensive efforts to address the concerns of local North Dakota \ncommunities about the pipeline, including spreading defamatory falsehoods regarding DAPL's \nsupposed, but actually nonexistent, intrusion on local indigenous peoples' -- the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe's -- historically important burial sites and water supplies; as well as a defamatory \ncampaign  to  interfere  with  and,  indeed,  destroy  Energy  Transfer's  relationships  with  its \ninvestors, financiers, and other constituents. \n[¶6]  In fact, prior to starting construction on the pipeline, Energy Transfer spent more \nthan two years working closely with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\"), \nand North Dakota officials, to identify a route for the pipeline that would have the least impact \non local stakeholders and resources.  Energy Transfer went to great lengths to engage with all \ninterested stakeholders potentially affected by the pipeline's construction, including the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe (\"SRST\").  As a result, DAPL almost exclusively tracks private land, does not \nencroach on SRST  land, and  entirely avoids disturbance to historic and cultural  resources. \nAccordingly, USACE determined -- with the concurrence of the North Dakota State Historic \nPreservation Officer -- that the Project affected no historic properties.  USACE also determined \nthat because Energy Transfer used the latest safety and protective technologies to construct \nDAPL, the risk of spill was extremely low. \n[p]  Notwithstanding Defendants' specific knowledge of the foregoing, Defendants' \nactions and words made clear that their purpose was to inflict as much financial harm as possible \non Energy Transfer, whether or not they could actually prevent construction of the pipeline.  In \nfact, when court decisions and other events confirmed the lawfulness and propriety of DAPL, \nDefendants  stated  openly  that  their  efforts  were  nonetheless  justified  by  the  tremendous \nadditional expense and delay they caused to Energy Transfer. \n[118]  Defendants' malicious intent -- and their stunning hypocrisy -- were evidenced \nby, among other things, the fact that the call for \"direct action\" incited, led, and financially \n3 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 7 of 78\nsupported by Defendants left tribal and other lands in an utterly degraded condition -- strewn \nwith rotting garbage, pest-infested firewood, human waste, orphaned animals, abandoned tents \nand other structures, and over 830 dumpster loads of trash.  The Greenpeace Defendants --\nwhose pockets were lined with tens of millions of dollars in anti-DAPL contributions they raised \nfrom around the globe -- disappeared, and contributed not a cent to restore North Dakota to the \ncondition in which they found it.  Instead, the bill for the multi-million dollar cleanup of the \n\"environmental disaster\" left by protestors fell largely upon the citizens of North Dakota and \nAmerican taxpayers, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. \n[119]  As  the  citizens  of  North  Dakota  experienced  firsthand,  the  Defendants, \npurportedly protesting Energy Transfer and DAPL, inflicted other significant harm upon the \nState of North Dakota and its citizens in addition to the environmental mess they left behind. \nNorth Dakota citizens suffered months of harassment, intimidation, and threats from protestors; \ntheir property was destroyed; ranchers' cattle and bison were butchered or maimed; graves were \nvandalized; and local residents' private property was vandalized, leaving people feeling unsafe \nand  under  siege  in  their  own  homes.  The  State  of  North  Dakota  publicly  condemned \nDefendants' conduct: \"[t]he real brutality [was] committed by violent protesters who use[d] \nimprovised explosive devices to attack police, use[d] hacked information to threaten officers and \ntheir families, and use[d] weapons to kill livestock, harming farmers and ranchers.\" \n[1110]  By  this  action,  Energy  Transfer  seeks  to  recover  the  millions  of dollars  of \ndamages caused by Defendants' unlawful, malicious, and coordinated attack on Energy Transfer \nand DAPL.  Energy Transfer in no way seeks to limit or threaten anyone's lawful exercise of \ntheir rights to free expression of their political and other beliefs and opinions, or in any way \nsuppress political debate over important environmental issues.  Defendants' actions, however, \nwere not protected free speech or expression.  Instead, they were designed to inflict damage, \n4 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 8 of 78\ncause delay, defame Energy Transfer, and disrupt Energy Transfer as much as possible; and it is \nfor all of this that  Energy Transfer seeks  to  vindicate  its own legal  rights in the  face of \nDefendants'  extensive,  unjustified, and  unlawful  conduct  that  is  set  forth  in  detail  in this \ncomplaint. \nPARTIES AND RELEVANT NON-PARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n[If 1 1 ]  Plaintiff Energy Transfer LP is a master limited partnership organized under the \nlaws of Delaware and headquartered in Dallas, Texas.

In 2018, Greenpeace USA \nrecruited and hired Brown as a \"pipeline campaigner\" focused on \"Greenpeace's priority project \nof 2018\" -- stopping pipelines and interfering with Energy Transfer's infrastructure projects. \nBrown  has trained,  supported,  and directed  ongoing obstruction  against  Energy Transfer's \ninfrastructure projects, including the Bayou Bridge Pipeline in Louisiana. \nDefendants Red Warrior Society aka Red Warrior Camp, Cody Hall, and Krystal \nTwo Bulls \n6 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 10 of 78\n[¶2O]  Defendant Cody Hall is a resident of South Dakota.  Defendant Hall is a leader, \norganizer, spokesperson, and fundraiser for Red Warrior Society. \nr12.11  Defendant Krystal Two Bulls is a resident of Montana.  Defendant Two Bulls \nserves as a leader, organizer, media coordinator, and fundraiser for Red Warrior Society. \n[1[22]  Red Warrior Society is an informal organization of the most violent, most radical \nanti-DAPL activists in North Dakota and across the country.  Red Warrior Society is a front \norganization for Greenpeace USA intended to provide cover for Greenpeace USA's support of \nand  engagement  in  illegal,  violent  \"direct  action\"  against  Energy  Transfer  and  DAPL. \nDefendant Hall formed Red Warrior Camp, the physical incarnation of Red Warrior Society, \nnear the DAPL crossing at Lake Oahe in the fall of 2016 with the financial support and direction \nof Greenpeace USA and Earth First! in connection with anti-DAPL protests in North Dakota. \n[¶23]  Red  Warrior  Society,  and  its members at  Red  Warrior  Camp,  distinguished \nthemselves from other activists by their express rejection of non-violent protest, and embrace of \nviolence and \"militant direct action\" tactics against Energy Transfer and DAPL. \"Militant direct \naction,\" as the term is used by Red Warrior Society, means the destruction of Energy Transfer \nconstruction  equipment and other property, attacks on and  intimidation of Energy Transfer \nemployees, and operations specifically designed to damage or destroy DAPL.  In the words of \nDefendant Two Bulls, \"Militant direct action is a strategy we use to build real movements, \nchange power dynamics, shift societies and even remove governments.\" \nNon-Party Banktrack \n[1124]  Banktrack,  aka  Stichting  Banktrack,  is  a  not-for-profit  foundation  based  in \nNimegen, the Netherlands.  Banktrack coordinated with Greenpeace Defendants to publish and \ndisseminate false statements about Energy Transfer and DAPL.  Banktrack also coordinated with \nGreenpeace Defendants to disseminate false statements about Energy Transfer and DAPL to \nEnergy Transfer's lenders to induce the termination or impairment of these relationships. \nNon-Party Earth First! \n7 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 11 of 78\n[¶25]  Earth First!, an unincorporated association, is a radical environmentalist activist \ngroup.  In  connection  with  DAPL  protests,  Earth  First!  provided  $500,000  to  extremist \nprotestors, including Cody Hall and Krystal Two Bulls, to form and fund the violent Red Warrior \nCamp at DAPL crossing near Lake Oahe; coordinated with Greenpeace USA to provide training \nin \"direct action\" and criminal sabotage to Red Warrior Camp; and distributed copies of its \nDirect Action Manual and Ecodefense Guide -- which provide instruction on \"direct action\" \ntechniques -- at protest camps in North Dakota and other sites along DAPL's route. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n[¶26]  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to N.D. R. Civ. P. 4(b)(2) because each \ndefendant directly and through agents transacts business within the state; committed tortious acts \nwithin or outside the state causing injury to another person or property within the state; and/or \nhave committed a tort within the state causing injury to another person or property within or \noutside the state. \n[¶27]  Venue is proper in Morton County pursuant to N.D.C.C. § 28-04-05 because a \nsubstantial number of the events and conduct giving rise to this action occurred in this county. \nFACTS \nA.  Energy Transfer carefully and extensively plans and designs DAPL to track \nprivately owned land and minimize environmental impact. \n[¶28]  On June 25, 2014, Energy Transfer announced the development and construction \nof DAPL -- a 1,172 mile underground oil pipeline -- to transport nearly a half-million barrels of \ndomestically produced crude oil across four states on a daily basis.  Via the pipeline, oil is \ntransported  from  the  Bakken  region  in  North  Dakota,  across  South  Dakota  and  Iowa,  to \nPatoka, Illinois, where it connects to the national and international oil refining and distribution \nnetworks. \n8 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 12 of 78\n[1129]  For the next 25 months, the Company -- working closely with USACE and North \nDakota state officials -- conducted extensive planning to identify a route for the pipeline that \nwould have the least impact on community stakeholders, the environment, and other natural and \ncultural resources. \n[1130]  As a result of Energy Transfer's careful planning, DAPL traverses private land for \n99% of its route. One exception is where DAPL crosses federally-owned and regulated waters at \nthe Missouri River under the man-made Lake Oahe -- a reservoir that begins just north of Pierre, \nSouth Dakota and extends nearly to Bismarck, North Dakota.  Lake Oahe is federally owned and \nregulated, as is the land surrounding it.  The Lake Oahe crossing is located a half mile above the \nnorthern boundary of the SRST reservation.  As shown in the image below, DAPL does not \ncross any SRST-owned land or water. \nMorton County  Emmons County \nPrivately-Owned Land \nPrivately-Owned Land \nDakota Access \nPipeline Path \n1.094 Feet of Path \nExisting Non-DAPL \nOwned by the  (UNDERGROUND) \nDual 42-inch Pipelines  Federal Government \n(UNDERGROUND) \nPrivately-Owned Land \nSTANDING ROCK  Privately-Owned Land \nRESERVATION \n[¶31]  As depicted in the image below, the pipeline \"crosses\" 90 to 115 feet beneath \nLake Oahe along the route of an existing pipeline -- the Northern Border Pipeline.

Defendants execute an unlawful and violent campaign to cause financial and \nreputational harm to Energy Transfer and to obstruct construction of DAPL. \n[1133]  No later than July 2016, as DAPL neared completion, the Greenpeace Defendants \nconspired and agreed with Banktrack, Earth First!, Cody Hall, and Krystal Two Bulls to engage \nin a coordinated campaign to obstruct Energy Transfer's construction of DAPL and its business \noperations and to inflict the maximum amount of financial and reputational harm possible upon \nEnergy Transfer. \n[¶34]  Defendants' operations against Energy Transfer consisted of three components. \nFirst, the Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack disseminated  false statements about Energy \nTransfer and DAPL to the public for the purpose of raising funds to further their anti-DAPL \nagenda, inciting thousands of protestors to descend on Lake Oahe to halt construction of DAPL, \n10 \n\nCCaassee  11::1199--ccvv--0000004499--CCRRHH    DDooccuummeenntt  11--22    FFiilleedd  0033//1188//1199    PPaaggee  1144  ooff  7788 \nand  damaging  Energy  Transfer's  reputation.  Second,  Greenpeace  USA  and  Earth  First! \norganized, funded, and supported unlawful acts of trespass, property destruction, and violence by \nprotestors (including Hall and Two Bulls) to obstruct construction and operation of DAPL. \nThird, the Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack disseminated false statements about Energy \nTransfer and DAPL directly to Energy Transfer's lenders and investors to induce the termination \nor impairment of these relationships and/or contracts and damage Energy Transfer's reputation. \n1.  Defendants disseminate malicious false statements about Energy Transfer \nand DAPL in a misinformation campaign. \n[95]  Beginning in (at the latest) August 2016 and continuing through the months of \nprotests at  Lake  Oahe,  the  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  commenced  large-scale \ndissemination of false claims about the impacts of the development, construction, and operation \nof DAPL.  These misrepresentations were disseminated via, inter alia, mass entails sent by these \nDefendants  to their membership,  donor,  and  other email  lists, websites operated  by  these \nDefendants, press releases, social media accounts and other means. \n['1136] \nThe Greenpeace Defendants' and Banktrack's specific misrepresentations are set \nforth in detail in Appendix A to this Complaint.  These Defendants' misrepresentations regarding \nDAPL and Energy Transfer fall into six broad categories: (a) false statements regarding DAPL's \npath, (b) false statements alleging Energy Transfer \"desecrated\" cultural resources, (c) false \nstatements regarding the environmental impact of DAPL on water supplies, (d) false statements \nregarding  the  impact  of DAPL  on  climate  change, (e)  false  statements  regarding  Energy \nTransfer's pre-construction environmental assessments of DAPL project, and (f) false statements \nregarding Energy Transfer's treatment of anti-DAPL protestors.  As will be shown at trial, each \nof these misrepresentations, individually and collectively, caused substantial damage to Energy \nTransfer. \n11 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 15 of 78\na.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL traverses SRST lands. \n[¶37]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack made, and repeated countless times, \nbaseless claims regarding DAPL's route.  Specifically, they falsely represented that the pipeline \nwould traverse under and/or across sovereign SRST land.  This is false.  In fact, the pipeline \ndoes not traverse SRST property, at all.  The Lake Oahe crossing is located a half-mile north of \nthe legal boundary of the SRST reservation.  Its waters are federally owned and regulated, as is \nthe 1.4 miles of land beneath Lake Oahe where DAPL passes under the waterway.  The land \nadjacent to Lake Oahe, through which the pipeline traverses is likewise federally owned.  The \nfacts regarding DAPL's specific path have been publicly known since before construction on the \npipeline  ever  commenced.  Yet  the  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  repeatedly \ndisseminated this false claim to thousands upon thousands, if not millions, of people, including \ntheir constituents and the general public, as part of their effort to  raise funds and to incite \nanti-DAPL protests. \nb.  Defendants misrepresented that Energy Transfer desecrated \ncultural resources. \n[¶38]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  also  falsely  claimed  that  Energy \nTransfer \"deliberately  desecrated  documented  burial grounds and  other  culturally important \nsites\" and \"destroyed sacred Native Lands\" and \"religious and other historical sites.\"  Contrary \nto these claims,  DAPL  route  was meticulously  planned  to, and  does,  avoid historically or \nculturally important sites.  In fact, as the Defendants were well aware, Energy Transfer went to \nextraordinary lengths to ensure cultural resources were not disturbed or destroyed, including by \nconsulting with SRST prior to construction.  Indeed, in April 2016, USACE determined -- with \nthe concurrence of the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer -- that the pipeline \naffected no historic properties. \n12 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 16 of 78\n[¶39]  Moreover, findings of the North Dakota State Historical  Society, released on \nSeptember 22, 2016, gave lie to any claim that Energy Transfer desecrated historical resources \nnear Lake Oahe.  In fact, after conducting its own, independent cultural resource survey of the \nLake Oahe corridor and DAPL's impact on the cultural and historical resources, the North \nDakota State Historical Society concluded that there was \"no evidence of infractions [by Energy \nTransfer] . . . with respect to disturbance of human remains or significant sites.\" \nc.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL would \"poison\" SRST \nwater supplies. \n[1140]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack falsely alleged DAPL would result in \n\"[m]illions of people los[ing] access to a clean water supply, including the Standing Rock Sioux \nTribe.\"  This  is  not  only  false,  but  impossible.  There  is  consensus  among the  scientific \ncommunity that pipelines are the safest method to transport energy products and the risks of any \npipeline rupture are minimal.  Moreover,  regardless of false assessment of the risks to the \nSRST's water supply in the future, these Defendants asserted that, as a matter of current fact, \nresidents of North Dakota including the  SRST would  lose access to  clean water upon the \nconstruction of DAPL. \n[T41]  Again, it is beyond cavil that these assertions are false.  DAPL was designed and \nconstructed in strict compliance with federal safety requirements and industry best practices, and \nutilized the latest safety and protective technologies.  Safety features of the pipeline include a \ntechnologically  advanced  corrosion-resistant,  external  coating  over  the  pipeline;  advanced, \nautomated leak detection; and remote-controlled isolation valves to allow rapid sealing in the \nevent of a leak in the pipeline.  Energy Transfer employed advanced, low-impact horizontal \ndirectional drilling techniques for installation of the pipeline below bodies of water and other \nsensitive sites.  Moreover, DAPL's construction did not result in any North Dakota resident \nlosing access to clean water, as was asserted. \n13 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 17 of 78\nd.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL would catastrophically \nalter climate. \n[¶42]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  falsely  claimed  that  DAPL  is a \n\"climate destroying project\" as a result of increased greenhouse emissions purportedly caused by \nthe pipeline.  In fact, DAPL has a net positive climate impact because it provides infrastructure \nto transport oil  that would otherwise be carried by fossil fuel-intensive railroads, trucks, or \nbarges, all of which have a higher likelihood of causing environmental damage from spills or \nleaks.  Since DAPL became operational, oil-carrying train traffic  within North Dakota has \ndecreased from 12 daily trains, or 1,200 cars, at similar oil production volumes, to 2 trains, or \n200 cars, and has thus lowered net fossil-fuel consumption and carbon emissions.  As a result, \nDAPL has had an undeniably positive impact on each of the environmental concerns cited by \nDefendants. \ne.  Defendants  misrepresented  that  DAPL  was  routed  and \napproved  without  adequate  environmental  review  or \nconsultation. \n[¶43]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  further  misrepresented  that  DAPL's  approval \n\"was rushed,  lacked  proper  government-to-government  consultation  with  [SRST],\"  was \n\"rubber-stamp[ed],\" and \"approved without adequate environmental reviews.\"  This too is false, \nand, in fact, has been rejected twice by the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia \n(the \"DC  Court\")  in Standing Rock Sioux  Tribe,  et al.  v.  U.S.  Army  Corps of Engineers, \n16-cv-1534, a lawsuit challenging the adequacy of the consultation and environmental review \nprocess for DAPL. \n[¶44]  On September 9, 2016, the D.C. Court found that Energy Transfer \"prominently \nconsidered\" the \"potential presence of historic properties\" in choosing a route for the pipeline: \nUsing past cultural surveys, the company devised DAPL's route to account for \nand avoid sites that had already been identified as potentially eligible for or listed \non the National Register of Historic places.  With that path in hand, in July 2014, \nthe company purchased rights to a 400-foot corridor along its preliminary route to \n14 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 18 of 78\nconduct extensive new cultural surveys of its own.  These surveys eventually \ncovered the entire length of the pipeline in North and South Dakota, and much of \nIowa  and  Illinois.  Professionally  licensed  archaeologists  conducted  Class  II \ncultural surveys, . . . [and] [i]n some places, . . . intensive Class III cultural \nsurveys. . . . \nWhere  this  surveying  revealed  previously  unidentified  historic  or  cultural \nresources that might be affected, the company mostly chose to reroute.  In North \nDakota, for example, the cultural surveys found  149 potentially eligible sites, \n91 of which had stone features.  The pipeline workspace and route was modified \nto avoid all 91 of these stone features and all but 9 of the other potentially eligible \nsites.  By the time the company finally settled on a construction path, then, the \npipeline route had been modified 140 times in North  Dakota alone to avoid \npotential cultural resources.  Plans had also been put in place to mitigate any \neffects on the other 9 sites through coordination with the North Dakota SHPO. \nAll told, the company surveyed nearly twice as many miles in North Dakota as \nthe 357 miles that would eventually be used for the pipeline. \n[¶45]  The D.C. Court also detailed Energy Transfer's efforts to consult with the SRST, \nnoting that, despite \"dozens of attempts to engage Standing Rock,\" the \"Tribe largely refused to \nengage in consultations.\"  Nonetheless, the D.C. Court also concluded that the USACE -- who \nprovided  critical  oversight  of  DAPL  planning  --  independently  consulted  with  the  SRST \nregarding DAPL's proposed path.  In fact, the D.C. Court found that the USACE \"exceeded its \nNHPA obligations\" in considering the SRST's concerns: \nFor  example,  in  response  to  the  Tribe's concerns  about  burial  sites  at  the \nJames River crossing, the  Corps  verified  that  cultural  resources  indeed  were \npresent and instructed Dakota Access to move the site to avoid them.  Dakota \nAccess did so.  Furthermore, the Corps took numerous trips to Lake Oahe with \nmembers of the Tribe to identify sites of cultural significance.  [The USACE \ncommander] also met with the Tribe no fewer than four times in the spring of \n2016 to discuss their concerns with the pipeline.  Ultimately, the Corps concluded \nthat no sites would be affected by the DAPL construction at Lake Oahe, and the \nState Historic Preservation  Officer who had  visited that  site concurred.  The \nCorps'  effort  to consult  the Tribe on this site —  the  place that most clearly \nimplicated the [SRST' s] cultural interests — sufficed under the NHPA. . . . [T]his \nis not a case about empty gestures. . . . [T]he Corps and the Tribe engaged in \nmeaningful exchanges that in some cases resulted  in concrete changes to the \npipeline's route. \n15 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 19 of 78\n[¶46]  In addition, on June 14, 2017, the D.C. Court rejected the SRST's claim that the \nUSACE's review process was inadequate; finding instead that the USACE amply considered \nviable alternatives to the final route, the risks of spill, and the environmental impact of any \npotential spill.  The D.C. Court found that the environmental analysis extensively \"discuss[ed] \nDAPL's 'reliability and safety,'\" providing \"the necessary content\" to support its conclusion that \nthe risk of a spill is very low. \n[¶47]  Further, the D.C. Court held that Energy Transfer's choice of the approved route, \nrather than an alternative route that traversed closer to Bismarck, North Dakota was not only \nlegal, but prudent because, among other reasons, the proposed Bismarck route would have been \nco-located with existing utility or pipeline routes for only 3 percent of the total route, and thus \nposed a substantially greater risk of negative impact to cultural resources and the environment \nthan the selected route. \nf.  Defendants  misrepresented  that  Energy  Transfer  used \nexcessive force against peaceful protests. \n[¶48]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  also  repeatedly  published  false \nstatements  that  Energy  Transfer  \"commit[ted]  grievous  human  rights  violations\"  against \n\"peaceful\" and \"non-violent\" anti-DAPL protestors.  This too is false.  Energy Transfer did not \nutilize \"excessive  force\" --  let  alone  commit \"human  rights  violations\" -- against  anyone. \nConstruction  workers  and  private  security  officers  exercised  restraint,  and  proportionately \nresponded to extreme violence and intentional sabotage directed at Energy Transfer employees \nand property by protestors.  In fact, the protests incited and funded by Defendants at Lake Oahe \nwere not remotely peaceful.  The State of North Dakota publicly concluded that it was not \nEnergy Transfer that was violent, but the protestors:  \"[t]he real brutality [was] committed by \nviolent  protesters who use[d]  improvised  explosive devices  to  attack police, use[d]  hacked \ninformation to threaten officers and their families, and use[d] weapons to kill livestock, harming \nfarmers and ranchers.\" \n16 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 20 of 78\n[1149]  The U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota likewise described the \nprotests as \"mindless and senseless criminal mayhem,\" with \"protestors attaching themselves to \nconstruction  equipment  operated  by  Dakota  Access;  vandalizing  and  defacing  construction \nequipment;  trespassing  on  privately  owned  property;  obstructing  work  on  the  pipeline.\" \nDakota Access, LLC v. Archambault, 2016 WL 5107005, at *2 (D.N.D. Sept. 16, 2016). \n2.  Defendants  organize,  fund,  and  support  unlawful  acts  of  trespass, \nproperty destruction, and violence. \n1.  Defendants obstruct construction of the pipeline in North \nDakota. \n[11150]  In  or  around  August  2016,  in  response  to  the  Defendants'  misinformation \ncampaign, thousands of protestors from around the country and the world traveled to North \nDakota to join what to date had been small, local protests against DAPL.  As more and more \nout-of-state protestors descended on the Lake Oahe crossing, they formed massive encampments \non surrounding land.  Greenpeace USA sent its \"direct action trainers\" to the camps to lead \n\"daily  direct  action  trainings,\"  including  instruction  in  \"hard  lockdown  blockades\"  and \n\"technical blockades.\"  Among other things, Greenpeace USA taught protestors how to use \nU-locks,  steel  cables,  chains,  and  heavy  metal  pipes  to  attach  themselves  to  construction \nequipment.  Protestors proceeded to employ these tactics at  DAPL construction sites on an \nalmost daily basis between August and November 2016, causing a total shutdown of pipeline \nconstruction. \n[¶51]  In  or  around  August  2016,  Earth  First!,  in  concert  with  the  Greenpeace \nDefendants, gave $500,000 in seed money to the most extreme anti-DAPL protestors to form and \nsupport \"Red Warrior Camp.\"  Red Warrior Camp was formed to organize the protestors most \nwilling to engage in violence against Energy Transfer employees and DAPL.  Greenpeace USA \nsupported Red Warrior Camp by providing direct action training to its members and excusing its \nown employees from their jobs at Greenpeace to join Red Warrior Camp (while being paid by \nGreenpeace USA) to protest DAPL as members of Red Warrior Camp.  Greenpeace USA also \nheld a donation drive in ten or more cities across North America to raise money and supplies to \n17 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 21 of 78\nsupport  Red  Warrior  Camp,  whose  advocacy  of violent  protest  against  the  pipeline,  and \ndemonstrated willingness to engage in violence against Energy Transfer employees, was well \nknown. \n[1152]  Red Warrior Camp openly announced its violent intentions and spread its violent \nmessage  on  social  media  via  a series of recruitment  videos  posted  by  a  purported  parent \norganization styled the \"Red Warrior Society.\"  One video, called an \"Official  Red  Warrior \nSociety Communique,\" uses stylized footage of Red Warrior Camp members wearing hoods and \nmasks standing in front of a camera as the sun rises behind them.  One masked member holds a \nlarge bolt cutter over his shoulder.  The video claims to bring a \"message from the active front \nline resistance\" and issues a call for \"skilled and trained warriors who are prepared to evict the \nDakota Access Pipeline.\" \noF,5,190kr\nNoi \nWARRIOR CA \nCOMMUNIQUE \nWe write you this message from \nthe active frontline resistance \nt.  4 \nour War Cry and loin us here in  Let us kill this Black Snake once \nStanding Rock immediately.  and for all. \nand trained Warriors prepared to \nevict the Dakota Access \nPipeline \n18 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 22 of 78\n[¶53]  Another video, entitled an \"Official Warrior Communique From the Front Lines\" \nand produced with digital effects imitating a coded military transmission, features a masked Red \nWarrior Camp member issuing a call to action.  The video repeatedly cuts to footage of violent \nanarchic riots across the world and urges the viewer to \"take railroads.  Take bridges.  Do it! \nThey cannot stop us all!\" \n19 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 23 of 78\n[¶54]  Another video documents Red Warrior Society's \"Mask Up and Donate\" tour of \nthe United States to seek financial support.  The video states that the Red Warrior Society is \n\"looking for likeminded warriors\" who will \"join [them] in [their] fight for water by any means \nnecessary.\"  The video refers to Red Warrior Society members as \"Black Snake Killaz\" who eat \n\"rubber bullets for breakfast.\" \n[¶55]  Red  Warrior  Society  also  produced  documentary-style  recruitment  and \nfundraising videos that glorified and celebrated its members' unlawful acts.  One video, titled \n\"The Water Wars Have Begun #NODAPL,\" focused on conflicts between members of Red \nWarrior Camp and law enforcement in North Dakota on October 27, 2016.  The video displays \nimages of burning barricades, burning cars, and violent confrontations between masked Red \nWarrior Camp members law enforcement.  A masked and hooded member of Red Warrior Camp \nstates, \"This is on the frontlines, right now.  This is War.\"  As Red Warrior Camp burns roads \nand barricades, a masked member of Red Warrior Camp threatens, \"This is nothing compared to \nwhat the corporate greed does.\" \n20 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 24 of 78\nF561  Another video shows an  event  held  at 8th  Street and  Memorial  Highway  in \nMandan, North Dakota in which members clad in military-style camouflage jackets, black hoods, \nski goggles, and bandanas chant \"black snake killas\" and \"no pipeline pigs.\"  The video also \ncontains images of a mock Thanksgiving feast with a severed pig's head covered in blood as law \nenforcement personnel stand nearby. \n21 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 25 of 78\n[1[57]  Red  Warrior Society's violent anti-DAPL propaganda was also spread to the \npublic through social media posts, primarily via Facebook.  These posts often featured images of \nmasked Red Warrior Society members, calls to arms, and other violent, anti-DAPL imagery. \n[1158]  One image stated, \"No Compromise, Stand For Water\" and depicted masked Red \nWarrior Society members pointing drawn bows at a Native American wearing a shirt inscribed \n\"DAPL\" sitting in front of stacks of money: \nNQ CEIMPREIllirE \nItANd FOR WAtER \nRed Warrior Society posted the image above with text that read: \"By Any Means Necessary \nstand where ever [sic] you are the waters connect us all #EARTHSARMY.\" \n[159]  In  another  Facebook  post,  Red  Warrior  Society  provided  \"instructions\"  for \ndisabling security guards or other law enforcement that stated: \"Step I.

Movements  around  the  world  use  confrontational  action  as a \nstrategy, not just as a tactic. Militant movements in Serbia ousted Milosevic . . . . \nMilitant direct action is a strategy we use to build real movements, change power \ndynamics, shift societies and even remove governments. \nA copy of Two Bulls article is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. \n24 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 28 of 78\n[¶66]  As set forth below, Two Bulls and her Red Warrior Society cohorts made good on \ntheir advocacy for \"militant direct action\" against Energy Transfer and DAPL and carried out a \nstring of militant attacks on Energy Transfer operations in North Dakota. \n2.  Hall leads Red Warrior Camp's violent attacks on DAPL \nand Enemy Transfer. \n[1167]  On August 10, 2016, roughly 100 protestors led by Red Warrior Camp and Hall \nentered DAPL property near Lake Oahe.  Upon entering, Red Warrior Camp members sought to \nobstruct Energy Transfer employees from gaining access to the property.  One member -- who \nopenly carried a 12-inch knife on his hip -- threatened Energy Transfer personnel on their way to \nwork that if they tried to enter the site they would get \"hurt.\"  Another member chained himself \nto a DAPL fence. \n[1168]  The following day, August 11, 2016, approximately 200 protestors led by Red \nWarrior  Camp  and  Hall  again  raided  DAPL  property  near  Lake  Oahe,  jumping  fences, \nthreatening Energy Transfer employees by brandishing knives and other weapons, and further \nthreatening to attack them.  Upon entering the property, Red Warrior Camp members destroyed \nbarricades constructed by Energy Transfer to prevent trespassers from entering the construction \nsite.  Local police were called to provide protection to Energy Transfer employees. \n[1169]  Attacks continued on August 12, 2016 when Red Warrior Camp members again \nraided Energy Transfer property and threatened violence against Energy Transfer employees on \nthe property and prevented others from entering to perform their jobs.  As a result ❑f the \npersistent and escalating threats of violence against Energy Transfer employees, local police --\nwho had been called on each of the previous days -- were again called in to provide protection to \nEnergy Transfer employees attempting to evacuate the property.  As the police escorted the \nemployees out, Red Warrior Camp members attacked departing cars with rocks and bottles. \n25 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 29 of 78\n[¶70]  On September 3, 2016, Red Warrior Camp and Hall led hundreds of protestors in \nan attack on Energy Transfer's construction crews working on DAPL.  Members of Red Warrior \nCamp stampeded  horses,  loosed dogs, and  drove  cars  onto  federal and  private  land where \nconstruction was occurring.  Red  Warrior Camp  members attacked  security personnel with \nknives, fence posts, flagpoles, and other improvised weapons. \n[¶71]  Red  Warrior  Camp  members again  attacked  Energy Transfer  employees and \nproperty on September 6, 2016. \n[1172]  Days later, Defendant Hall was arrested by local police and charged with criminal \ntrespass for his role in the multiple attacks on Energy Transfer and DAPL. \n[173]  Red  Warrior Camp attacked again on September 9, 2016.  Masked members, \narmed with knives and hatchets, swarmed a DAPL construction site two miles east of Highway \n1806, leaving a wake of destruction in their path. \n[¶74]  On September 13, 2016, members of Red Warrior Camp again illegally entered a \nDAPL  construction  site  and  used  steel  pipes  to  lock  themselves  to  DAPL  construction \nequipment.  The next day, September 14, 2016, Red Warrior Camp members trespassed at a \nDAPL construction site and attached themselves to a DAPL excavator, preventing its use. \n3.  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  raise funds  to  support  Red \nWarrior Camp's violent mission. \n[1175]  Simultaneous  with  and  after  the  attacks  described  above,  the  Greenpeace \nDefendants mounted a nationwide campaign to raise money and supplies to support and further \nRed Warrior Camp's attacks on DAPL and Energy Transfer.  During this time, Greenpeace USA \norganized donation drives in ten cities across the United States to collect supplies to fund, feed, \nand house Red Warrior Camp members at Lake Oahe.  Greenpeace USA directed funds be sent \ndirectly to Red Warrior Camp, or were delivered by Greenpeace, notwithstanding Hall's recent \n26 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 30 of 78\narrest.  At this time, Red Warrior Camp's record of violence against Energy Transfer personnel \nwas well known, including within Greenpeace USA, and yet, with full knowledge that their aid \nto Red Warrior Camp would sustain it and allow its members to perpetrate violence, Greenpeace \nUSA continued its fundraising activities on Red Warrior Camp's behalf.  The supplies and funds \nGreenpeace USA raised directly enabled Red Warrior Camp's violent attacks on DAPL through \nOctober and November 2016. \n[1176]  Greenpeace USA published an advertisement of its donation drives on its website, \nhttps://www.greenpeace.org/usakampaign-updates/supply-drive-for-dakota-red-warrior-camp/: \nWIZEIREACC  f  O  Donate \nWhat Were Doing  Sabtoonuets  R Victones  RReios,t art n  Q \nHow It Works  flews & Media  Contact \n...se > Soppy Clews for the Red Warrior and Sacred Stone Camps \nc \"act to My., 4 Medi.,\nSupply Drives for the Red Warrior and \nSacred Stone Camps \nr  • \nWe're hosting a supply drives at Greenpeace offices across the country on Monday, Sept 12 and \nMonday.

This communique \nurged the public to \"take escalated action to stop the pipeline.\" A copy of the communique is \nattached hereto as Exhibit 2. \n[¶78]  Red Warrior Camp continued violent attacks on Energy Transfer and DAPL over \nthe following months.  On September 25, 2016, Red Warrior Camp led hundreds of protestors \nwho trespassed on Energy Transfer property west of Highway 6, damaging equipment on site. \nWhen security personnel informed Red Warrior Camp members they were trespassing, members \nbrandished  knives  and  assaulted  a security  guard,  dragging  the  security  guard  100  yards. \nParamedics were called to treat the security guard for injuries. \n[¶79]  On October 27, 2016, Red Warrior Camp led protestors who again trespassed on \nEnergy Transfer property near Highway 1806, set up roadblocks to prevent access to the area, \nand erected an encampment on Energy Transfer property.  When law enforcement requested that \nRed Warrior Camp members remove the barricade and leave Energy Transfer's property, Red \nWarrior Camp members responded with violence.  On this night, Red Warrior Camp members \nbuilt makeshift barriers between themselves and the police and lit them on fire to prevent law \nenforcement from evicting them from the site.  Red Warrior Camp members threw Molotov \ncocktails at law enforcement, setting fire to DAPL land and appurtenant structures.  Red Warrior \nCamp members also deliberately set fire to numerous Energy Transfer vehicles and its heavy \nconstruction equipment, destroying the property in the process. \n29 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 33 of 78\n30 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 34 of 78\n31 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 35 of 78\n32 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 36 of 78\n33 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 37 of 78\n34 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 38 of 78\n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 39 of 78\n[¶80]  On  November 20, 2016,  Red  Warrior Camp members gathered at a  location \nknown as Backwater Bridge.

SRST votes to evict  Red  Warrior Camp, condemning its \nviolence against Energy Transfer and DAPL. \n[¶81]  As a result of Red Warrior Camp's violent tactics, on November 1, 2016, the \nSRST Tribal Council unanimously voted to ask Red Warrior Camp to decamp from the Lake \nOahe area out of concern for the safety of non-violent protestors opposing DAPL and because \nSRST rejected Red Warrior Camp's violent tactics.  Red Warrior Camp ignored SRST's request, \nand not only did not leave the area, but continued to perpetrate violent operations against Energy \nTransfer and DAPL, rather than adopt the non-violent means of protest that SRST preferred and \nsupported. \n36 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 40 of 78\n3.  Defendants target Energy Transfer's business constituents. \n[¶82]  In addition to the misrepresentations regarding DAPL and Energy Transfer that \nthe Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack disseminated to the general public and their followers \nin the anti-fossil fuel and environmental activist communities, these Defendants also mounted a \nmisinformation campaign directly targeted at Energy Transfer's business constituents in an effort \nto  induce  the  termination of existing contracts or relationships or the  impairment of these \nrelationships.  In particular, the Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack focused their efforts on \nbanks  financing DAPL and Energy Transfer's other ongoing and  prospective  infrastructure \nprojects.  The specific misrepresentations directed by the Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack \nare set forth in detail in Appendix A to the Complaint.  These actions, together with those \ndetailed  below,  were  designed to  inflict  maximum  financial  harm  to  Energy Transfer, and \nsucceeded in doing significant damage to the company and its relationship with the financial \nmarketplace. \n[¶83]  For example, on November 8, 2016, Banktrack and Greenpeace USA sent a joint \nletter to the Equator Principles Association, a consortium of global banks that includes Energy \nTransfer lenders DNB, ING, Nordea, and BNP Paribas.  The letter falsely alleged that Energy \nTransfer committed \"gross violations of Native land titles,\" \"deliberately desecrated documented \nburial grounds and other culturally important sites,\" and violated human rights. \n[1184]  In reliance on these misrepresentations, DNB, one of the banks funding DAPL, \nsold  its  equity  interest  in  Energy Transfer,  totaling  approximately $3  million.  DNB also \npromised to reconsider its participation in the lending facility to DAPL.  Greenpeace USA took \ncredit for DNB's divestment of shares in Energy Transfer, but continued to call on DNB to exit \nits loan to Energy Transfer. \n37 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 41 of 78\n[¶85]  Days later, Greenpeace  USA published a communique on its website entitled \n\"Another Major Norwegian Investor Divests From Companies Behind Dakota Access Pipeline.\" \nThe article stated, falsely, that Energy Transfer was \"disregard[ing] Indigenous sovereignty to \ndestroy Native lands and water supply.\" The article reiterated calls on DNB and Citibank to halt \nfunding for DAPL, and called on Norwegian funds, such as KLP and Storebrand, to divest its \nshares in Energy Transfer. \n[1[86]  Between November 28-30, 2016, Banktrack, GPI, and Greenpeace USA sent joint \nletters to 17 banks involved  in the  $2.5 billion lending facility to  DAPL, including DNB, \nCitigroup, and NO, urging these banks to exit DAPL loan facility based on false claims about \nthe impact of DAPL on the environment and cultural and historical resources. \n[1187]  In  response  to  Greenpeace  Defendants'  and  Banktrack's  misrepresentations, \nCitibank announced the retention of Foley Hoag LLP, a law firm with human rights expertise, on \nbehalf of the consortium of banks financing DAPL.  The consortium retained Foley Hoag to \nreview various matters relating to the permitting process.  Over the course of the following \nfour months, Energy Transfer incurred fees and diverted resources to respond to requests for \ninformation in connection with Foley Hoag's investigation. \n[¶88]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  continued  to  disseminate \nmisrepresentations to the banks throughout 2017.  In reliance on these misrepresentations, banks \nterminated their relationships with Energy Transfer.  In January 2017, NG divested its shares in \nthe Company. \n[¶89]  On February 2, 2017, after meeting with Greenpeace Netherlands and Banktrack, \nwho misrepresented that Energy Transfer violated the SRST's rights, ABN AMRO announced \nthat it would not pursue new business with Energy Transfer.  On February 8, 2017, following \nin-person meetings where Greenpeace USA falsely represented that DAPL \"go[es] through the \n[SRST]'s reservation  land,\" Nordea announced  it would  exclude Energy Transfer  from  all \ninvestments. \n38 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 42 of 78\n[¶90]  In March 2017, after representatives of Greenpeace Netherlands dug room for and \nplanted 15 meters of super heavy pipe at ING headquarters in protest against DAPL, ING sold its \nshare  of  the  $2.5  billion  credit  facility,  totaling  $120  million.  DNB  sold  its  estimated \n$340 million  share  of  DAPL  loan,  after  numerous  calls  by  Greenpeace  Defendants  and \nBanktrack to end its participation.  Norwegian funds KLP and Storebrand sold their shares in \nEnergy Transfer. \n[11191]  On April 5, 2017, BNP Paribas sold its $120 million share of the loan. \nC.  Defendants' criminal scheme caused substantial harm in North Dakota. \n[¶92]  Defendants' campaign against Energy Transfer has had significant contact with, \nand effects in, North Dakota where Energy Transfer was actively involved in the construction of \n357 miles of DAPL. \n[¶93]  Defendants' unlawful scheme was intended to -- and did -- cause harm to Energy \nTransfer in North Dakota.  First, Greenpeace Defendants'  campaign of misinformation was \ndirected at disrupting lawful construction activity near the Lake Oahe crossing in North Dakota. \nSecond,  Greenpeace  Defendants,  Red  Warrior  Camp,  Cody  Hall,  and  Krystal  Two  Bulls \norganized,  funded,  and  directed  violent  activities  against  Energy  Transfer  and  DAPL  at \nconstruction sites in North Dakota.  Third, Greenpeace Defendants targeted Energy Transfer's \nbusiness  constituents,  intending  to  interfere  with  Energy  Transfer's  financing  and  stop \nconstruction in North Dakota. \n[1[94]  As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts, Energy Transfer suffered substantial \ndamage  in  North  Dakota,  including  costs  of delayed  construction,  unanticipated  costs  of \nprofessional security services to ward off violent protesters, and costs associated with mitigating \nDefendants' misinformation campaign in North Dakota. \n39 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 43 of 78\n[¶95]  Defendants' wrongful conduct also caused immense harm to the state of North \nDakota and its citizens.  North Dakota taxpayers were damaged in an amount of more than \n$38 million to pay for state and local responses to the protests and related illegal activities.  The \nSRST -- on whose behalf Defendants purported to act -- incurred significant damages to begin \nmajor  cleanup and  restoration  in January 2017 to prevent  snowmelt  from  washing tens of \nthousands of pounds of garbage into the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers and contaminating the \nvery waters the Defendants were purporting to protect.  On federal land alone, it took USACE \napproximately three weeks in March and April 2017, and $1.1 million of taxpayers' money to \nclean up after the protesters left 835 dumpsters worth of trash and debris in their wake. \nD.  Defendants continue organize, fund, and  direct  unlawful and destructive \nattacks on Energy Transfer's infrastructure projects. \n[1f96]  Greenpeace and Earth First! members continue to jointly target Energy Transfer's \ninfrastructure projects.  Greenpeace USA and Earth First! members have funded and directed \nprotestors to establish encampments to protest the Mariner East 2 pipeline in Pennsylvania and \nthe Bayou Bridge Pipeline in Louisiana.  In 2018, Greenpeace USA hired defendant Charles \nBrown as a pipeline organizer solely to interfere with Energy Transfer's projects.  Greenpeace \nUSA sent Brown and other employees to train hundreds of protestors at both campsites.  Using \nGreenpeace/Earth First! blockade techniques, protestors have stopped construction on an almost \ndaily basis for both projects.  Additionally, unknown individuals have used Ecodefense Guide \ntechniques to vandalize bulldozers and other construction equipment at both sites.  Earth First! \nmembers, through Earth First! Journal, have called for \"further sabotage\" and a \"proliferation of \nmore actions like these.\" \n40 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 44 of 78\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I \nTRESPASS TO LAND AND CHATTEL \n(AGAINST THE GREENPEACE DEFENDANTS, \nRED WARRIOR SOCIETY, HALL, TWO BULLS) \n[¶97]  Energy Transfer re-alleges and  incorporates every allegation in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth in full. \n[¶98]  As  set  forth  above,  the  above-named  Defendants  willfully  entered  Energy \nTransfer's property without consent or other privilege. \n[¶99]  The above-named  Defendants funded, trained, directed, and caused others to \nwillfully enter Energy Transfer's property without consent or other privilege. \n[¶100] Upon willfully entering  Energy  Transfer's  property without  consent or  other \nprivilege, the above-named defendants and individuals funded and trained by the above-named \nDefendants  maliciously  and  wantonly  damaged  and  destroyed  Energy  Transfer's  property, \nprevented Energy Transfer from using its land and construction equipment, and disrupted Energy \nTransfer's operations and caused financial harm to Energy Transfer. \n[¶101] As a result of the above-named defendants' intentional trespass, Energy Transfer \nsuffered harm and damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including damages for damaged or \ndestroyed construction equipment, fencing and other barrier systems, and land;

DAPL traverses SRST lands; \nb.  DAPL will poison SRST's water supply; \nc.  DAPL will catastrophically alter the climate; \nd.  DAPL  was  routed  and  approved  without  adequate  environmental  review  or \nconsultation with SRST; \ne.  Energy Transfer used excessive and illegal force against peaceful protestors; and \nf.  Energy Transfer intentionally desecrated SRST's cultural resources. \n[¶118] Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  published  these  false  and  misleading \nstatements in numerous publications on the interne, social media platforms, and in direct emails, \nletters,  telephone  communications,  and  in-person  meetings  to  Energy  Transfer's  creditors, \ninvestors, and other critical market constituents, as well as to the public at large. \n[¶119] Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  made  and  published  the  false  and \ndefamatory statements set forth herein with actual malice, as such statements were made by \nGreenpeace Defendants and Banktrack with knowledge of their falsity or reckless disregard for \ntheir truth. \n[¶120] Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack published these falsehoods to third-parties \nand understood and intended that these false statements would have the effect of injuring Energy \nTransfer's  reputation,  preventing  others  from  doing  business  with  Energy  Transfer,  and \ninterfering with Energy Transfer's existing business relationships. \n[¶121] Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack's false statements directly harmed Energy \nTransfer's business, property, and reputation in an amount to be determined at trial.  Energy \nTransfer's harm includes lost financing; lost profits; increased expenses; legal fees; and monies \nexpended  to  mitigate  the  impact  of  Greenpeace  Defendants'  and  Banktrack's  defamation \ncampaign. \n44 \n\nCase 1:19-cv-00049-CRH   Document 1-2   Filed 03/18/19   Page 48 of 78\nCOUNT VI \nTORTIOUS INTERFERENCE \n(AGAINST THE GREENPEACE DEFENDANTS) \n[11122] Energy Transfer re-alleges and  incorporates every allegation  in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth in full. \n[¶123] Energy Transfer had many existing and prospective valid business relationships \nwith  third-parties,  including  with:  (i)  existing  and  prospective  creditors;  (ii)  existing  and \nprospective  investors;  and  (iii)  existing  and  prospective  long-term  capacity  transportation \nshippers. \n[11124] The Greenpeace Defendants knew of Energy Transfer's existing and prospective \nbusiness relationships with these third-parties. \n[11125] The  Greenpeace  Defendants  intentionally  interfered  with  Energy  Transfer's \nexisting and prospective business relationships with these third-parties by disseminating false, \nmisleading, and defamatory statements concerning Energy Transfer's business and DAPL and \nsupporting,  funding,  and  executing  trespass  and  violence  on  Energy  Transfer's  land  and \nproperty. This interference was committed intentionally and without justification or excuse. \n[11126] Energy Transfer had a reasonable expectation of obtaining the benefits of these \nexisting and prospective business relationships.  Each of the Defendants was aware of, and \nintended  to  cause,  this  detrimental  impact  on  Energy  Transfer's  existing  and  prospective \nbusiness relationships. \n[¶127] The  Greenpeace  Defendants'  tortious  interference  directly  and  proximately \nharmed  Energy  Transfer's business  relationships.

Defendants' unlawful acts include violent \nattacks against Plaintiffs' employees and property, soliciting money for and providing funding to \nsupport these illegal attacks, inciting protests to disrupt construction, and a vast, malicious \npublicity campaign against Energy Transfer and Dakota Access.  All the while, Defendants \nutilized the anti-DAPL platform to raise tens of millions of dollars in donations from the public \nunder the guise of concern over indigenous peoples' rights. \n[3]  The conduct and harm alleged here has been described by the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of North Dakota as \"mindless and senseless criminal mayhem\" that is not \nprotected by the rights of free speech and assembly: \nWith respect to the assertion the movement has been a peaceful protest, one need \nonly turn on a television set or read any newspaper in North Dakota.  There the \nviewer will find countless videos and photographs of the \"peaceful\" protestors \nattaching themselves to construction equipment operated by Dakota Access; \nvandalizing and defacing construction equipment; trespassing on privately-owned \nproperty; obstructing work on the pipeline; and verbally taunting, harassing, and \nshowing disrespect to members of the law enforcement community .... The \nestimated damage to construction equipment and loss of work on the project is far \nin excess of several million dollars .... To suggest that all of the protest activities \nto date have been \"peaceful\" and law-abiding defies commonsense and reality. \nDakota Access,  LLC v.  Archambault, No.  l:16-cv-296, 2016 WL 5107005, at *2 (D.N.D. \nSept. 16, 2016). \n[{4]  Defendants advanced their extremist agenda -- to attack and disrupt Energy \nTransfer and Dakota Access's business and their construction of DAPL -- through means far \noutside the bounds of democratic political action,  protest,  and peaceful, legally protected \nexpression of dissent.  Instead, Defendants pursued \"militant direct action\" -- in the words of \nDefendant Two Bulls -- including trespass onto Dakota Access's private property; unlawful \ninvasion of Dakota Access's easements; violent and destructive attacks on Dakota Access's \n2 \n\nconstruction equipment and other private property; arson; and intimidation, harassment, and \nassault of Plaintiffs' employees. \n[[5]  Defendants  also  engaged  in  large-scale,  intentional  dissemination  of \nmisinformation and outright falsehoods regarding both Energy Transfer and Dakota Access, \nDAPL's environmental impact, and the companies' extensive efforts to address the concerns of \nlocal North Dakota communities about the pipeline, including spreading defamatory falsehoods \nregarding DAPL's supposed, but actually nonexistent, intrusion on local indigenous peoples° -  \nthe Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's -- historically important burial sites and water supplies; as well \nas a defamatory campaign to interfere with and, indeed, destroy Energy Transfer and Dakota \nAccess's relationships with investors, financiers, and other constituents. \n[[6]  In fact, prior to starting construction on the pipeline, Plaintiffs spent more than \ntwo years working closely with the United States Army Corps of Engineers (\"USACE\"), and \nNorth Dakota officials, to identify a route for the pipeline that would have the least impact on \nlocal stakeholders and resources.  Plaintiffs went to great lengths to engage with all interested \nstakeholders potentially affected by the pipeline's construction, including the Standing Rock \nSioux Tribe (\"SRST\").  As a result, DAPL almost exclusively tracks private land, does not \nencroach on SRST land, and entirely avoids disturbance to historic and cultural resources. \nAccordingly, USACE determined -- with the concurrence of the North Dakota State Historic \nPreservation Officer -- that the Project affected no historic properties.  USACE also determined \nthat because DAPL was constructed with the latest safety and protective technologies, the risk of \nspill was extremely low. \n[{7]  Notwithstanding Defendants' specific knowledge of the foregoing, Defendants° \nactions and words made clear that their purpose was to inflict as much financial harm as possible \n3 \n\non Energy Transfer and Dakota Access, whether or not they could actually prevent construction \nof the pipeline.  In fact, when court decisions and other events confirmed the lawfulness and \npropriety of DAPL, Defendants stated openly that their efforts were nonetheless justified by the \ntremendous additional expense and delay they caused to Energy Transfer and Dakota Access. \n[8]  Defendants' malicious intent -- and their stunning hypocrisy -- were evidenced \nby, among other things, the fact that their calls for \"direct action\" incited, led, and financially \nsupported by Defendants left tribal and other lands in an utterly degraded condition -- strewn \nwith rotting garbage, pest-infested firewood, human waste, orphaned animals, abandoned tents \nand other structures, and over 830 dumpster loads of trash.  The Greenpeace Defendants -  \nwhose pockets were lined with tens of millions of dollars in anti-DAPL contributions they raised \nfrom around the globe -- disappeared, and contributed not a cent to restore North Dakota to the \ncondition in which they found it.  Instead, the bill for the multi-million dollar cleanup of the \n\"environmental disaster\" left by protestors fell largely upon the citizens of North Dakota, \nAmerican taxpayers, and the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. \n[f9]  As  the  citizens  of North  Dakota  experienced  firsthand,  the  Defendants, \npurportedly protesting Energy Transfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL, inflicted other significant \nharm upon the State of North Dakota and its citizens in addition to the environmental mess they \nleft behind. North Dakota citizens suffered months of harassment, intimidation, and threats from \nprotestors; their property was destroyed; ranchers' cattle and bison were butchered or maimed; \ngraves were vandalized; and local residents' private property was vandalized, leaving people \nfeeling unsafe and under siege in their own homes.  The State of North Dakota publicly \ncondemned Defendants' conduct: \"[t]he real brutality [was] committed by violent protesters who \n4 \n\nuse[ d] improvised explosive devices to attack police, use[ d] hacked information to threaten \nofficers and their families, and use(d] weapons to kill livestock, harming farmers and ranchers.\" \n(11 O]  By this action, Energy Transfer and Dakota Access seek to recover the millions of \ndollars of damages caused by Defendants' unlawful, malicious, and coordinated attack on \nEnergy Transfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL.  Energy Transfer and Dakota Access in no way \nseeks to limit or threaten anyone's lawful exercise of their rights to free expression of their \npolitical and other beliefs and opinions, or in any way suppress political debate over important \nenvironmental  issues.  Defendants' actions,  however,  were not protected free speech or \nexpression.  Instead, they were designed to inflict damage, cause delay, defame Energy Transfer \nand Dakota Access, and disrupt their operations as much as possible.

Energy Transfer and Dakota Access carefully and extensively plan and \ndesign DAPL to track privately owned land and minimize environmental \nimpact. \n[{[29]  On June 25, 2014, Plaintiffs announced the development and construction of \nDAPL -- a 1,172 mile underground oil pipeline -- to transport nearly a half-million barrels of \ndomestically produced crude oil across four states on a daily basis.  Via the pipeline, oil is \ntransported from the Bakken region in North Dakota,  across South Dakota and Iowa, to \nPatoka, Illinois, where it connects to the national and international oil refining and distribution \nnetworks. \n9 \n\n[i!30]  For the next 25 months, Plaintiffs -- working closely with USACE and North \nDakota state officials -- conducted extensive planning to identify a route for the pipeline that \nwould have the least impact on community stakeholders, the environment, and other natural and \ncultural resources. \n[i!31]  As a result of Plaintiffs' careful planning, DAPL traverses private land for 99% of \nits route.  One exception is where DAPL crosses federally-owned and regulated waters at the \nMissouri River under the man-made Lake Oahe -- a reservoir that begins just north of Pierre, \nSouth Dakota and extends nearly to Bismarck, North Dakota.  Lake Oahe is federally owned and \nregulated, as is the land surrounding it. The Lake Oahe crossing is located a half mile above the \nnorthern boundary of the SRST reservation.  As shown in the image below, DAPL does not \ncross any SRST-owned land or water. \nEiimiions County \n- . .  ''· ..

Defendants execute an unlawful and violent campaign to cause financial and \nreputational harm to Energy Transfer and Dakota Access and to obstruct \nconstruction of DAPL. \n[134]  No later than July 2016, as DAPL neared completion, the Greenpeace Defendants \nconspired and agreed with Banktrack, Earth First!, Cody Hall, and Krystal Two Bulls to engage \nin a coordinated campaign to obstruct Energy Transfer and Dakota Access's construction of \nDAPL and their business operations and to inflict the maximum amount of financial and \nreputational harm possible upon Energy Transfer and Dakota Access. \n[{[35]  Defendants\" operations against Energy Transfer and Dakota Access consisted of \nthree components.  First,  the Greenpeace Defendants  and Banktrack disseminated false \nstatements about Energy Transfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL to the public for the purpose of \n11 \n\nraising funds to further their anti-DAPL agenda, inciting thousands of protestors to descend on \nLake Oahe to halt construction of DAPL, and damaging Energy Transfer and Dakota Access's \nreputation.  Second,  Greenpeace USA and Earth First!  organized, funded,  and supported \nunlawful acts of trespass, property destruction, and violence by protestors (including Hall and \nTwo Bulls) to obstruct construction and operation of DAPL. Third, the Greenpeace Defendants \nand Bank.track disseminated false statements about Energy Transfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL \ndirectly to Energy Transfer and Dakota Access's respective lenders and investors to induce the \ntermination or impairment of these relationships and/or contracts and damage both Energy \nTransfer's and Dakota Access's reputations.  Defendants' defamatory attacks on DAPL,\" the \n\"pipeline,\" Dakota Access,\" and \"Energy Transfer\" were intended to harm both Dakota Access \nand Energy Transfer.  While Dakota Access and Energy Transfer are separate corporate entities, \nDefendants made no distinctions between Plaintiffs in their defamatory attacks, and used these \nnames and phrases interchangeably to attack all Plaintiffs. \n1.  Defendants  disseminate  malicious  false  statements  about  Energy \nTransfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL in a misinformation campaign. \n[{[36]  Beginning in (at the latest) August 2016 and continuing through the months of \nprotests at Lake Oahe, the Greenpeace Defendants and Bank.track commenced large-scale \ndissemination of false claims about the impacts of the development, construction, and operation \nof DAPL. These misrepresentations were disseminated via, inter alia, mass emails sent by these \nDefendants to their membership, donor, and other email lists, websites operated by these \nDefendants, press releases, social media accounts, and other means. \n[{37]  The Greenpeace Defendants\" and Banktrack's specific misrepresentations are set \nforth in detail in Appendix A to this Complaint.  Defendants' misrepresentations regarding \nEnergy Transfer, Dakota Access, and DAPL fall into six broad categories:  (a) false statements \n12 \n\nregarding DAPL's path, (b) false statements alleging Energy Transfer \"desecrated\" cultural \nresources, (c) false statements regarding the environmental impact of DAPL on water supplies, \n( d) false statements regarding the impact of DAPL on climate change, ( e) false statements \nregarding Energy Transfer's pre-construction environmental assessments of the DAPL project, \nand (f) false statements regarding Energy Transfer's treatment of anti-DAPL protestors.  A \nnumber of Defendants' false publications specifically identify Energy Transfer as DAPL's \n\"project lead\" and \"primary builder,\" and describe DAPL as \"a project of Energy Transfer,\" \nthereby defaming Energy Transfer by false statements about the planning, approval, and \nconstruction of DAPL. \n[{[38]  As will be shown at trial, each of Defendants' misrepresentations, individually \nand collectively, caused substantial harm and damage to both Dakota Access and Energy \nTransfer. \na.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL traverses SRST lands. \n[{[39]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack made, and repeated countless times, \nbaseless claims regarding DAPL's route.  Specifically, they falsely represented that the pipeline \nwould traverse under and/or across sovereign SRST land.  This is false.  In fact, the pipeline \ndoes not traverse SRST property, at all The Lake Oahe crossing is located a half-mile north of \nthe legal boundary of the SRST reservation.  Its waters are federally owned and regulated, as is \nthe 1.4 miles of land beneath Lake Oahe where DAPL passes under the waterway.  The land \nadjacent to Lake Oahe, through which the pipeline traverses, is likewise federally owned.  The \nfacts regarding DAPL's specific path have been publicly known since before construction on the \npipeline  ever commenced.  Yet the  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack repeatedly \ndisseminated this false claim to thousands upon thousands, if not millions, of people, including \n13 \n\ntheir constituents and the general public, as part of their effort to raise funds and to incite \nanti-DAPL protests. \nb.  Defendants misrepresented that Energy Transfer and Dakota \nAccess desecrated cultural resources. \n['i[40]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack also falsely claimed that Energy \nTransfer \"deliberately desecrated documented burial grounds and other culturally important \nsites\" and \"destroyed sacred Native Lands\" and \"religious and other historical sites.\" Contrary \nto these claims, the DAPL route was meticulously planned to, and does, avoid historically or \nculturally important sites.  In fact, as the Defendants were well aware, Plaintiffs went to \nextraordinary lengths to ensure cultural resources were not disturbed or destroyed, including by \nconsulting with SRST prior to construction.  Indeed, in April 2016, USACE determined -- with \nthe concurrence of the North Dakota State Historic Preservation Officer -- that the pipeline \naffected no historic properties. \n[41]  Moreover, findings of the North Dakota State Historical Society, released on \nSeptember 22, 2016, refute any claim that Energy Transfer or Dakota Access desecrated \nhistorical resources near Lake Oahe.  In fact, after conducting its own, independent cultural \nresource survey of the Lake Oahe corridor and DAPL's impact on the cultural and historical \nresources, the North Dakota State Historical Society concluded that there was \"no evidence of \ninfractions . . . with respect to disturbance of human remains or significant sites\" as a result of \nthe DAPL project. \nc.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL would \"poison\" SRST \nwater supplies. \n['i[42]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack falsely alleged that DAPL would \nresult in \"[m]illions of people los[ing] access to a clean water supply, including the Standing \nRock Sioux Tribe.\"  This is not only false, but impossible.  There is consensus among the \n14 \n\nscientific community that pipelines are the safest method to transport energy products and the \nrisks of any pipeline rupture are minimal.  Moreover, regardless of false assessment of the risks \nto the SRST's water supply in the future, these Defendants asserted that, as a matter of current \nfact, residents of North Dakota including the SRST would lose access to clean water upon the \nconstruction of DAPL. \n[{f43]  Again, it is beyond cavil that these assertions are false.  Plaintiffs designed and \nconstructed DAPL in strict compliance with federal safety requirements and industry best \npractices, and utilized the latest safety and protective technologies.  Safety features of the \npipeline include a technologically advanced corrosion-resistant,  external  coating over the \npipeline; advanced, automated leak detection; and remote-controlled isolation valves to allow \nrapid sealing in the event of a leak in the pipeline.  DAPL employed advanced, low-impact \nhorizontal directional drilling techniques for installation of the pipeline below bodies of water \nand other sensitive sites.  Plaintiffs were, or should have been, aware of all of these facts as they \nwere publicly available.  Moreover, DAPL's construction did not result in any North Dakota \nresident losing access to clean water, as was asserted. \nd.  Defendants misrepresented that DAPL would catastrophically \nalter climate. \n[i!44]  The Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack falsely claimed that DAPL is a \n\"climate destroying project\" as a result of increased greenhouse emissions purportedly caused by \nthe pipeline.  In fact, DAPL has a net positive climate impact because it provides infrastructure \nto transport oil that would otherwise be carried by fossil fuel-intensive railroads, trucks, or \nbarges, all of which have a higher likelihood of causing environmental damage from spills or \nleaks.  Since DAPL became operational, oil-carrying train traffic within North Dakota has \ndecreased from 12 daily trains, or 1,200 cars, at similar oil production volumes, to 2 trains, or \n15 \n\n200 cars, and has thus lowered net fossil-fuel consumption and carbon emissions.  Again, these \nfacts were publicly available and were, or should have been, known by Defendants. \ne.  Defendants  misrepresented  that  DAPL  was  routed  and \napproved  without  adequate  environmental  review  or \nconsultation. \n[{4.5]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  further misrepresented  that DAPL's  approval \n\"was rushed,  lacked  proper  government-to-government  consultation  with  [SRST],\"  was \nrubber-stamp[ed],\" and \"approved without adequate environmental reviews.\" This too is false, \nand, in fact, has been rejected twice by the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia \n(the \"DC Court\") in Standing Rock Sioux Tribe,  et al.  v.  US.  Army Corps of Engineers, \n16-cv-1534, a lawsuit challenging the adequacy of the consultation and environmental review \nprocess for DAPL. \n[146]  On September 9, 2016, the D.C. Court found that Dakota Access \"prominently \nconsidered\" the \"potential presence of historic properties\" in choosing a route for the pipeline: \nUsing past cultural surveys, the company devised DAPL's route to account for \nand avoid sites that had already been identified as potentially eligible for or listed \non the National Register of Historic places.  With that path in hand, in July 2014, \nthe company purchased rights to a 400-foot corridor along its preliminary route to \nconduct extensive new cultural surveys of its own.  These surveys eventually \ncovered the entire length of the pipeline in North and South Dakota, and much of \nIowa and Illinois.  Professionally licensed archaeologists conducted Class II \ncultural surveys, .  .  .  [ and] [i]n some places, .  .  .  intensive Class III cultural \nsurveys .... \nWhere  this  surveying revealed previously unidentified historic  or cultural \nresources that might be affected, the company mostly chose to reroute.  In North \nDakota, for example, the cultural surveys found 149 potentially eligible sites, \n91 of which had stone features.  The pipeline workspace and route was modified \nto avoid all 91 of these stone features and all but 9 of the other potentially eligible \nsites.  By the time the company finally settled on a construction path, then, the \npipeline route had been modified 140 times in North Dakota alone to avoid \npotential cultural resources.  Plans had also been put in place to mitigate any \neffects on the other 9 sites through coordination with the North Dakota SHPO. \nAll told, the company surveyed nearly twice as many miles in North Dakota as \nthe 357 miles that would eventually be used for the pipeline. \n16 \n\n[47]  The D.C. Court also detailed Dakota Access's efforts to consult with the SRST, \nnoting that, despite \"dozens of attempts to engage Standing Rock,\" the \"Tribe largely refused to \nengage in consultations.\" Nonetheless, the D.C. Court also concluded that the USACE -- who \nprovided critical oversight of DAPL planning -- independently consulted with the SRST \nregarding DAPL's proposed path.  In fact, the D.C. Court found that the USACE \"exceeded its \nNHPA obligations\" in considering the SRST's concerns: \nFor example, in response to the Tribe's concerns about burial sites at the \nJames River crossing, the Corps verified that cultural resources indeed were \npresent and instructed Dakota Access to move the site to avoid them.  Dakota \nAccess did so.  Furthermore, the Corps took numerous trips to Lake Oahe with \nmembers of the Tribe to identify sites of cultural significance.  [The USACE \ncommander] also met with the Tribe no fewer than four times in the spring of \n2016 to discuss their concerns with the pipeline.  Ultimately, the Corps concluded \nthat no sites would be affected by the DAPL construction at Lake Oahe, and the \nState Historic Preservation Officer who had visited that site concurred.  The \nCorps' effort to consult the Tribe on this site - the place that most clearly \nimplicated the [SRST's] cultural interests - sufficed under the NHPA .... [T]his \nis not a case about empty gestures. .  . .  [T]he Corps and the Tribe engaged in \nmeaningful exchanges that in some cases resulted in concrete changes to the \npipeline's route. \n[{48]  In addition, on June 14, 2017, the D.C. Court rejected the SRST's claim that the \nUSACE's review process was inadequate; finding instead that the USACE amply considered \nviable alternatives to the final route, the risks of spill, and the environmental impact of any \npotential spill.  The D.C. Court found that the environmental analysis extensively discuss[ed] \nDAPL's 'reliability and safety,\"' providing \"the necessary content\" to support its conclusion that \nthe risk of a spill is very low. \n[{49]  Further, the D.C. Court held that Dakota Access's choice of the approved route, \nrather than an alternative route that traversed closer to Bismarck, North Dakota, was not only \nlegal, but prudent because, among other reasons, the proposed Bismarck route would have been \nco-located with existing utility or pipeline routes for only 3 percent of the total route, and thus \n17 \n\nposed a substantially greater risk of negative impact to cultural resources and the environment \nthan the selected route. \nf.  Defendants misrepresented that Plaintiffs used excessive force \nagainst peaceful protests. \n[{[50]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and Banktrack also repeatedly published false \nstatements that Energy Transfer and/or Dakota Access commit[ted] grievous human rights \nviolations\" against \"peaceful\" and \"non-violent\" anti-DAPL protestors.  This too is false. \nNeither Energy Transfer nor Dakota Access utilized \"excessive force\" -- let alone committed \n\"human rights violations\" -- against anyone.  Construction workers and private security officers \nexercised restraint, and proportionately responded to extreme violence and intentional sabotage \ndirected at Plaintiffs' employees and property by protestors.  In fact, the protests incited and \nfunded by Defendants at Lake Oahe were not remotely peaceful.  The State of North Dakota \npublicly concluded that it was not Energy Transfer or Dakota Access that was violent, but the \nprotestors:  \"[t]he real brutality [was] committed by violent protesters who use[d] improvised \nexplosive devices to attack police, use[ d] hacked information to threaten officers and their \nfamilies, and use[d] weapons to kill livestock, harming farmers and ranchers.\" \n[{51]  The U.S. District Court for the District of North Dakota likewise described the \nprotests as \"mindless and senseless criminal mayhem,\" with \"protestors attaching themselves to \nconstruction equipment operated by Dakota Access; vandalizing and defacing construction \nequipment;  trespassing on privately owned property;  obstructing work on the pipeline.\" \nDakota Access, LLC v. Archambault, 2016 WL 5107005, at *2 (D.N.D. Sept. 16, 2016). \n2.  Defendants  organize,  fund,  and  support unlawful acts  of trespass, \nproperty damage and destruction, and violence. \n1.  Defendants obstruct construction of the pipeline in North \nDakota. \n[{[52]  In or around August 2016,  in response  to the  Defendants' misinformation \ncampaign, thousands of protestors from around the country and the world traveled to North \n18 \n\nDakota to join what to date had been small, local protests against DAPL.  As more and more \nout-of-state protestors descended on the Lake Oahe crossing, they formed massive encampments \non surrounding land.  Greenpeace USA sent its \"direct action trainers,\" including direct action \ntrainer Harmony Lambert, to the camps to lead \"daily direct action trainings,\" including \ninstruction in \"hard lockdown blockades\" and \"technical blockades.\"  Among other things, \nGreenpeace USA taught protestors how to use U-locks, steel cables, chains, and heavy metal \npipes to attach themselves to construction equipment.  Protestors proceeded to employ these \ntactics at DAPL construction sites on an almost daily basis between August and November 2016, \ncausing a total shutdown of pipeline construction. \n[{53]  In or around August 2016,  Earth First!,  in concert with the  Greenpeace \nDefendants, gave $500,000 in seed money to the most extreme anti-DAPL protestors to form and \nsupport \"Red Warrior Camp.\" Red Warrior Camp was formed to organize the protestors most \nwilling to engage in violence against DAPL and Plaintiffs' employees.  Greenpeace USA \nsupported Red Warrior Camp by providing direct action training to its members and excusing its \nown employees from their jobs at Greenpeace to join Red Warrior Camp (while being paid by \nGreenpeace USA) to protest DAPL as members of Red Warrior Camp.  Greenpeace USA also \nheld a donation drive in ten or more cities across North America to raise money and supplies to \nsupport Red Warrior Camp, whose advocacy of violent protest against the pipeline, and \ndemonstrated willingness to engage in violence against Plaintiffs' employees, was well known. \n[{[54]  Red Warrior Camp openly announced its violent intentions and spread its violent \nmessage on social media via a series of recruitment videos posted by a purported parent \norganization styled the \"Red Warrior Society.\"  One video, called an \"Official Red Warrior \nSociety Communique,\" uses stylized footage of Red Warrior Camp members wearing hoods and \nmasks standing in front of a camera as the sun rises behind them.  One masked member holds a \nlarge bolt cutter over his shoulder.

The video states that the Red Warrior Society is \n\"looking for likeminded warriors\" who will ''join [them] in [their] fight for water by any means \n21 \n\nnecessary.\" The video refers to Red Warrior Society members as \"Black Snake Killaz\" who eat \n\"rubber bullets for breakfast.\" \n[i-157]  Red  Warrior  Society  also  produced  documentary-style  recruitment  and \nfundraising videos that glorified and celebrated its members' unlawful acts.  One video, titled \n\"The Water Wars Have Begun #NODAPL,\" focused on conflicts between members of Red \nWarrior Camp and law enforcement in North Dakota on October 27, 2016.  The video displays \nimages of burning barricades, burning cars, and violent confrontations between masked Red \nWarrior Camp members and law enforcement.  A masked and hooded member of Red Warrior \nCamp states, \"This is on the frontlines, right now.  This is War.\" As Red Warrior Camp burns \nroads and barricades, a masked member of Red Warrior Camp threatens, \"This is nothing \ncompared to what the corporate greed does.\" \n22 \n\n[i-158]  Another video shows an event held at 8th Street and Memorial Highway in \nMandan, North Dakota, in which members clad in military-style camouflage jackets, black \nhoods, ski goggles, and bandanas chant \"black snake killas\" and \"no pipeline pigs.\" The video \nalso contains images of a mock Thanksgiving feast with a severed pig's head covered in blood as \nlaw enforcement personnel stand nearby. \n23 \n\n[159]  Red Warrior Society's violent anti-DAPL propaganda was also spread to the \npublic through social media posts, primarily via Facebook.  These posts often featured images of \nmasked Red Warrior Society members, calls to arms, and other violent, anti-DAPL imagery. \n[{60]  One image stated, No Compromise, Stand For Water\" and depicted masked Red \nWarrior Society members pointing drawn bows at a Native American wearing a shirt inscribed \n\"DAPL\" sitting in front of stacks of money: \nNL LLIPPRDIPiI'E \nFtANJ FDIR WAtER \nRed Warrior Society posted the image above with text that read: \"By Any Means Necessary \nstand where ever [sic] you are the waters connect us all #EARTHSARMY.\" \n[{61]  In another Facebook post,  Red Warrior Society provided \"instructions\"  for \ndisabling security guards or other law enforcement that stated: \"Step 1.

Moreover, \nthe posts served to incite mayhem and violence against DAPL. \n[{66]  Throughout this period, Defendant Two Bulls served as, in her own words, Red \nWarrior Society's \"media coordinator,\" and would have been responsible for publication of the \nimages above. \n[{67]  In addition, on October 12, 2016, in the midst of the violence inflicted on DAPL \nby Red Warrior Society, Two Bulls published an editorial article entitled \"The Financial Powers \nBehind  the  Dakota  Access  Pipeline  Must  Be  Confronted\"  on  the  website \nwww.commondreams.org that called for \"militant direct action\" in the \"fight against the Dakota \nAccess Pipeline.\"  In the article, Two Bulls set forth \"lessons moving forward\" to guide \nopponents ofDAPL, including to: \nMake militant direct action the organizing strategy, not just a tool in the \ntoolbox.  .  .  .  Movements around the world use confrontational action as a \nstrategy, not just as a tactic. Militant movements in Serbia ousted Milosevic .... \nMilitant direct action is a strategy we use to build real movements, change power \ndynamics, shift societies and even remove governments. \nA copy of Two Bulls article is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. \n26 \n\n[{f68]  As set forth below, Two Bulls and her Red Warrior Society cohorts heeded their \nown calls for \"militant direct action\" against DAPL and carried out a string of militant attacks on \nDAPL operations in North Dakota. \n2.  Hall leads Red Warrior Camp's violent attacks on Plaintiffs \nandDAPL. \n[,I69]  On August 10, 2016, roughly 100 protestors led by Red Warrior Camp and Hall \nentered Dakota Access property near Lake Oahe.  Upon entering, Red Warrior Camp members \nsought to obstruct Plaintiffs' employees from gaining access to the property.  One member -  \nwho openly carried a 12-inch knife on his hip -- threatened DAPL personnel on their way to \nwork that if they tried to enter the site they would get \"hurt.\" Another member chained himself \nto a DAPL fence. \n[$70]  The following day, August 11, 2016, approximately 200 protestors led by Red \nWarrior Camp and Hall again raided Dakota Access property near Lake Oahe, jumping fences, \nthreatening Plaintiffs' employees by brandishing knives and other weapons,  and further \nthreatening to attack them.  Upon entering the property, Red Warrior Camp members destroyed \nbarricades constructed by Dakota Access to prevent trespassers from entering the construction \nsite. Local police were called to provide protection to Plaintiffs' employees. \n[{71]  Attacks continued on August 12, 2016, when Red Warrior Camp members again \nraided Dakota Access property and threatened violence against Plaintiffs' employees on the \nproperty and prevented others from entering to perform their jobs.  As a result of the persistent \nand escalating threats of violence against Plaintiffs' employees, local police -- who had been \ncalled on each of the previous days -- were again called in to provide protection to employees \nattempting to evacuate the property.  As the police escorted the employees out, Red Warrior \nCamp members attacked departing cars with rocks and bottles. \n27 \n\n[f72]  On September 3, 2016, Red Warrior Camp and Hall led hundreds of protestors in \nan attack on construction crews working on DAPL. Members of Red Warrior Camp stampeded \nhorses, loosed dogs, and drove cars onto federal and private land where construction was \noccurring.  Red Warrior Camp members attacked security personnel with knives, fence posts, \nflagpoles, and other improvised weapons. \n[173]  Red Warrior Camp members again attacked Plaintiffs' employees and Dakota \nAccess property on September 6, 2016. \n[{74]  Days later, Defendant Hall was arrested by local police and charged with criminal \ntrespass for his role in the multiple attacks on DAPL. \n[175]  Red Warrior Camp attacked again on September 9, 2016.  Masked members, \narmed with knives and hatchets, swarmed a DAPL construction site two miles east of Highway \n1806, leaving a wake of destruction in their path. \n[176]  On September 13, 2016, members of Red Warrior Camp again illegally entered a \nDAPL construction site and used steel pipes to lock themselves to DAPL construction \nequipment.  The next day, September 14, 2016, Red Warrior Camp members trespassed at a \nDAPL construction site and attached themselves to a DAPL excavator, preventing its use. \n3.  The Greenpeace Defendants raise funds to support Red \nWarrior Camp's violent mission. \n[177]  Simultaneous  with and after the  attacks  described above,  the  Greenpeace \nDefendants mounted a nationwide campaign to raise money and supplies to support and further \nRed Warrior Camp's attacks on DAPL. During this time, Greenpeace USA organized donation \ndrives in ten cities across the United States to collect supplies to fund, feed, and house Red \nWarrior Camp members at Lake Oahe.  Greenpeace USA directed funds be sent directly to Red \nWarrior Camp, notwithstanding Hall's recent arrest, and Greenpeace USA also delivered funds \n28 \n\nthat it collected to Red Warrior Camp.  At this time, Red Warrior Camp's record of violence \nagainst DAPL personnel was well known, including within Greenpeace USA, and yet, with full \nknowledge that their aid to Red Warrior Camp would sustain it and allow its members to \nperpetrate violence,  Greenpeace USA continued its fundraising activities on Red Warrior \nCamp's behalf.  The supplies and funds Greenpeace USA raised directly enabled Red Warrior \nCamp's violent attacks on DAPL through October and November 2016. \n[[78]  Greenpeace USA published an advertisement of its donation drives on its website, \nhttps://www.greenpeace.org/usa/campaign-updates/supply-drive-for-dakota-red-warrior-camp/: \n29 \n\n30 \n\n[{79]  During this same time period, Greenpeace USA published Red Warrior Camp's \npublic \"call to action\" -- authored by defendant Two Bulls -- on its website.  This communique \nurged the public to \"take escalated action to stop the pipeline.\" A copy of the communique is \nattached hereto as Exhibit 2. \n[{80]  Red Warrior Camp continued violent attacks  on DAPL over the  following \nmonths.  On September 25, 2016, Red Warrior Camp led hundreds of protestors who trespassed \non Dakota Access property west of Highway 6, damaging equipment on site.  When security \npersonnel informed Red Warrior Camp members they were trespassing, members brandished \nknives and assaulted a security guard, dragging the security guard 100 yards.  Paramedics were \ncalled to treat the security guard for injuries. \n[{[81]  On October 27, 2016, Red Warrior Camp led protestors who again trespassed on \nDakota Access property near Highway 1806, set up roadblocks to prevent access to the area, and \nerected an encampment on Dakota Access property.  When law enforcement requested that Red \nWarrior Camp members remove the barricade and leave Dakota Access's property, Red Warrior \nCamp members responded with violence.  On this night, Red Warrior Camp members built \nmakeshift barriers between themselves and the police and lit them on fire to prevent law \nenforcement from evicting them from the site.  Red Warrior Camp members threw Molotov \ncocktails at law enforcement, setting fire to Dakota Access land and appurtenant structures.  Red \nWarrior Camp members also deliberately set fire to numerous DAPL vehicles and its heavy \nconstruction equipment, destroying the property in the process. \n31 \n\n32 \n\n33 \n\n34 \n\n35 \n\n36 \n\n37 \n\n[{82]  On November 20, 2016, Red Warrior Camp members gathered at a location \nknown as Backwater Bridge.  Red Warrior Camp members tore down barbed wire fencing and \nillegally entered Dakota Access property.  Armed Red Warrior Camp members attacked police, \nignited fires on and near the bridge, and threw grenades and flares at law enforcement officers. \n4.  SRST votes to evict Red Warrior Camp, condemning its \nviolence against DAPL. \n[i!83]  As a result of Red Warrior Camp's violent tactics, on November 1, 2016, the \nSRST Tribal Council unanimously voted to ask Red Warrior Camp to decamp from the Lake \nOahe area out of concern for the safety of non-violent protestors opposing DAPL and because \nSRST rejected Red Warrior Camp's violent tactics.  Red Warrior Camp ignored SRST's request, \nand not only did not leave the area, but continued to perpetrate violent operations against DAPL, \nrather than adopt the non-violent means of protest that SRST preferred and supported. \n38 \n\n3.  Defendants target Energy Transfer and Dakota Access's respective \nbusiness constituents. \n[i!84]  In addition to the misrepresentations regarding Energy Transfer, Dakota Access, \nand DAPL that the Greenpeace Defendants and Banktrack disseminated to the general public and \ntheir followers in the anti-fossil fuel and environmental activist communities, these Defendants \nalso mounted a misinformation campaign directly targeted at both Energy Transfer and Dakota \nAccess's business constituents in an effort to induce the termination of existing contracts or \nrelationships or the impairment of these relationships.  In particular, the Greenpeace Defendants \nand Banktrack focused their efforts on banks financing DAPL and \"any other credit facilities to \nthe Energy Transfer Family of Partnerships,\" as wells as Energy Transfer's other ongoing and \nprospective infrastructure projects.  The specific misrepresentations directed by the Greenpeace \nDefendants and Banktrack are set forth in detail in Appendix A to the Complaint. These actions, \ntogether with those detailed below, were designed to inflict maximum financial harm to Energy \nTransfer and Dakota Access, and succeeded in doing significant damage to the companies and \ntheir relationship with the financial marketplace. \n[{85]  For example, on November 8, 2016, Banktrack and Greenpeace USA sent a joint \nletter to the Equator Principles Association, a consortium of global banks that includes Energy \nTransfer and Dakota Access lenders DNB, ING, Nordea, and BNP Paribas.  The letter falsely \nalleged that Energy Transfer and Dakota Access committed \"gross violations of Native land \ntitles,\" \"deliberately desecrated documented burial grounds and other culturally important sites,\" \nand violated human rights. \n[186]  In reliance on these misrepresentations, DNB, one of the banks funding DAPL, \nsold its equity interest in Energy Transfer, totaling approximately $3 million.  DNB also \n39 \n\npromised to reconsider its participation in the lending facility to DAPL.  Greenpeace USA took \ncredit for DNB's divestment of shares in Energy Transfer, but continued to call on DNB to exit \nits loan to Energy Transfer. \n[{87]  Days later, Greenpeace USA published a communique on its website entitled \n\"Another Major Norwegian Investor Divests From Companies Behind Dakota Access Pipeline.\" \nThe article stated, falsely, that Energy Transfer was \"disregard[ing] Indigenous sovereignty to \ndestroy Native lands and water supply.\" The article reiterated calls on DNB and Citibank to halt \nfunding for DAPL, and called on Norwegian funds, such as KLP and Storebrand, to divest its \nshares in Energy Transfer. \n[{88]  Between November 28-30, 2016, Banktrack, GPI, and Greenpeace USA sent joint \nletters to 17 banks involved in the $2.5 billion lending facility to DAPL, including DNB, \nCitigroup, and ING, urging these banks to exit DAPL loan facility based on false claims about \nthe impact ofDAPL on the environment and cultural and historical resources.  Immediately after, \nGreenpeace USA delivered a separate letter to Citibank reiterating the same false statements \ndemanding that Citibank \"withdraw from the [DAPL] loan agreement and any other credit \nfacilities to the Energy Transfer Family of Partnerships.\" \n[i!89]  In response to Greenpeace Defendants' and Banktrack's misrepresentations, \nCitibank announced the retention of Foley Hoag LLP, a law firm with human rights expertise, on \nbehalf of the consortium of banks financing DAPL.  The consortium retained Foley Hoag to \nreview various matters relating to the permitting process.  Over the course of the following \nfour months, Energy Transfer incurred fees and diverted resources to respond to requests for \ninformation in connection with Foley Hoag's investigation. \n[i!90]  The  Greenpeace  Defendants  and  Banktrack  continued  to  disseminate \nmisrepresentations to the banks throughout 201 7.  In reliance on these misrepresentations, banks \nterminated their relationships with Energy Transfer and Dakota Access.  In January 2017, ING \ndivested its shares in Energy Transfer. \n40 \n\n[{[91]  Misrepresentations continued in February 2017, when Greenpeace Defendants \ndemanded that Credit Suisse terminate its $850 million loan to DAPL \"project lead Energy \nTransfer Partners,\" falsely stating that Energy Transfer was responsible for \"fast-tracking \nprojects without regard for local communities\" and DAPL \"violates Indigenous rights and \nthreatens our climate,\" forcing Energy Transfer to expend resources to correct these false \nrepresentations. \n[i!92]  On February 2, 2017, after meeting with Greenpeace Netherlands and Banktrack, \nwho misrepresented that Energy Transfer violated the SRST's rights, ABN AMRO announced \nthat it would not pursue new business with Energy Transfer.  On February 8, 2017, following \nin-person meetings where Greenpeace USA falsely represented that DAPL \"go[es] through the \n[SRST]'s reservation land,\" Nordea announced it would exclude Energy Transfer from all \ninvestments. \n[{93]  In March 2017, after representatives of Greenpeace Netherlands dug room for and \nplanted 15 meters of super heavy pipe at ING headquarters in protest against DAPL, ING sold its \nshare of the $2.5 billion DAPL credit facility, totaling $120 million.  DNB sold its estimated \n$340 million share of DAPL loan,  after numerous calls by Greenpeace Defendants and \nBanktrack to end its participation.  Norwegian funds KLP and Storebrand sold their shares in \nEnergy Transfer. \n[{94]  Or April 5, 2017, BNP Paribas sold its $120 million share of the DAPL loan. \n[i!95]  Even after DAPL's completion, Greenpeace Defendants continue to interfere with \nEnergy Transfer's business relationships through their dissemination of false statements about \nEnergy Transfer and DAPL.  Beginning around March 2018 and continuing to this day, \nGreenpeace Defendants have demanded banks that have \"provided and/or arranged loans to ETP \nand related companies\" -- labeled the \"dirty dozen banks\" -- \"to end their financial relationship \nwith ETP and relevant subsidiaries,\" based on representations already proven demonstrably \n41 \n\nfalse, including the false allegations that Energy Transfer damag[ed] at least 380 sacred and \ncultural sites along the DAPL pipeline route\" and bulldoz[ed] an area of the pipeline corridor \nfilled with Tribal sacred sites and burials.\" \nC.  Defendants' criminal scheme caused substantial harm in North Dakota. \n[®96]  Defendants' campaign against Energy Transfer and Dakota Access has  had \nsignificant contact with, and effects in, North Dakota where Energy Transfer and Dakota Access \nwere actively involved in the construction of 357 miles ofDAPL. \n[{[97]  Defendants' unlawful scheme was intended to -- and did -- cause harm to Energy \nTransfer and Dakota Access in North Dakota.  First, Greenpeace Defendants' campaign of \nmisinformation was directed at disrupting lawful construction activity near the Lake Oahe \ncrossing in North Dakota.  Second, Greenpeace Defendants, Red Warrior Camp, Cody Hall, and \nKrystal Two Bulls organized, funded, and directed violent activities against DAPL construction \nsites in North Dakota.  Third, Greenpeace Defendants targeted Energy Transfer and Dakota \nAccess's business constituents, intending to interfere with Energy Transfer and Dakota Access's \nfinancing and stop construction in North Dakota. \n[{98]  As a result of Defendants' wrongful acts, Energy Transfer and Dakota Access \neach suffered substantial damage in North Dakota, including costs of delayed construction, \nunanticipated costs of professional security services to ward off violent protesters, and costs \nassociated with mitigating Defendants' misinformation campaign in North Dakota. \n[{99]  Defendants' wrongful conduct also caused immense harm to the state of North \nDakota and its citizens.  North Dakota taxpayers were damaged in an amount of more than \n$38 million to pay for state and local responses to the protests and related illegal activities.  The \nSRST -- on whose behalf Defendants purported to act -- incurred significant damages to begin \n42 \n\nmajor cleanup and restoration in January 2017 to prevent snowmelt from washing tens of \nthousands of pounds of garbage into the Cannonball and Missouri Rivers and contaminating the \nvery waters the Defendants were purporting to protect.  On federal land alone, it took USACE \napproximately three weeks in March and April 2017, and $ 1. 1 million of taxpayers' money, to \nclean up after the protesters left 835 dumpsters worth of trash and debris in their wake. \nD.  Defendants continue to organize, fund, and direct unlawful and destructive \nattacks on Energy Transfer's infrastructure projects. \n[{100] Greenpeace and Earth First! members continue to jointly target Energy Transfer's \ninfrastructure projects.  Greenpeace USA and Earth First!  members have funded and directed \nprotestors to establish encampments to protest the Mariner East 2 pipeline in Pennsylvania and \nthe Bayou Bridge Pipeline in Louisiana.  In 2018, Greenpeace USA hired defendant Charles \nBrown as a pipeline organizer solely to interfere with Energy Transfer's projects.  Greenpeace \nUSA sent Brown and other employees to train hundreds of protestors at both campsites.  Using \nGreenpeace/Earth First! blockade techniques, protestors have stopped construction on an almost \ndaily basis for both projects.  Additionally, unknown individuals have used Ecodefense Guide \ntechniques to vandalize bulldozers and other construction equipment at both sites.  Earth First! \nmembers, through Earth First! Journal, have called for \"further sabotage\" and a \"proliferation of \nmore actions like these.\" \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNTI \nTRESPASS TO LAND AND CHATTEL \n(DAKOTA ACCESS AGAINST THE GREENPEACE DEFENDANTS, \nRED WARRIOR SOCIETY, HALL, AND TWO BULLS) \n[{[101] Dakota Access re-alleges and incorporates every allegation in the foregoing \nparagraphs as if set forth in full. \n43 \n\n[ill 02] As set forth above, the above-named Defendants willfully entered Dakota \nAccess's property without consent or other privilege. \n[i1103] The above-named Defendants funded, trained, directed, and caused others to \nwillfully enter Dakota Access's property without consent or other privilege. \n[{104] Upon willfully entering Dakota Access's property without consent or other \nprivilege, the above-named defendants and individuals funded and trained by the above-named \nDefendants maliciously and wantonly damaged and destroyed DAPL property, prevented Dakota \nAccess from using its land and construction equipment, disrupted Dakota Access's operations, \nand caused financial harm to Dakota Access. \n[i1105] As a result of the above-named defendants' intentional trespass, Dakota Access \nsuffered harm and damages in an amount to be proven at trial, including damages for damaged or \ndestroyed construction equipment, fencing and other barrier systems, and land;

      "text": "STATE OF NORTH DAKOTA  IN DISTRICT COURT \nCOUNTY OF MORTON  SOUTH CENTRAL JUDICIAL DISTRICT \nEnergy Transfer LP (formerly known as Energy \nTransfer Equity, L.P.) and Energy Transfer  File No.  30-2019-CV-00180 \nOperating, L.P. (formerly known as Energy \nTransfer Partners, L.P.), \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nPlaintiffs,  AND ORDER \nvs. \nGreenpeace International ( also known as \n\"Stichting Greenpeace Council\"); Greenpeace, \nInc.; Greenpeace Fund, Inc.; Red Warrior Society \n( also known as \"Red Warrior Camp\"); Cody Hall; \nKrystal Two Bulls; and Charles Brown, \nDefendants. \n[if I]  The  above-entitled  matter  comes  before  the  Court  on  Greenpeace  International' s  (\"GPI\"), \nGreenpeace, Inc's. (\"GI\"), Greenpeace Fund (\"GPF\"), and Charles Brown's (\"Brown\") Motion to Dismiss \nPlaintiffs Complaint against him. \n[if2]  GPI, GI and Brown, for their motion, allege that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a claim under \nN.D. R. Civ. P.  12(b )(2)(ii).  GPI and Brown additionally assert the Complaint against them should be \ndismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.  GPI and GI also assert that Plaintiffs have no standing to bring \nthe action.  GPF also asserts that Plaintiffs' Complaint fails to state a claim against it. \nSTANDING \n[if3]  Dakota Access LLC is now a Plaintiff in the case.  Dakota Access is either a lessee or an owner of \nthe property at issue in this case.  It, therefore, has standing to bring this lawsuit. \nPERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER GPI AND BROWN \n[if4]  Personal jurisdiction, based on contacts, is governed by N.D.R.Civ.P. 4(b )(2), which states, in part, \nas follows: \nA court of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person who \nacts directly or by an agent as to any claim for relief arising from the person's \nI \n\nhaving such contact with this state that the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nover the person does not offend against traditional notions of justice or fair \nplay  or  the  due  process  of law,  under  one  or  more  of the  following \ncircumstances: \n(C) committing a tort within or outside this state causing injury to \nanother person or property within this state; \n[if5]  GPI appeared in the federal case, which was remanded.  A party's right to object to personal \njurisdiction can be waived.  Larson v. Dunn, 474 N.W.2d 34, 36 (N.D. 1991).  The Court, however, need \nnot decide this because there is personal jurisdiction of GPI by contact.  It committed tortuous acts outside \nthe state causing injury to persons or property in the state.  Here, Plaintiffs have made out a prima facie \ncause of action for defamation. \n[if6]  There's also personal jurisdiction over Brown.  There's a prima facie case of conspiracy against \nBrown, even though he joined GPI in 2018.  One who joins a conspiracy after its inception, knowing its \nimproper purpose is responsible.  United States v. Heater, 689 F.2d 783, 788 (8th Cir. 1982).  Brown is \nalleged to have committed a tort outside the state causing damage to a person or property within the state. \n[if7]  Concerning GPF, it and GPI also hold themselves out as Greenpeace USA.  They share a common \ndirector.  In published reports, Greenpeace USA, GPF and GPI have admitted, in public filings, that they \ncontrol  all  Greenpeace's operation in the United  States.  The  Court concludes these  entities are  so \ninterrelated that GPF knew or should have known about libelous statements made by GPI. \nFAILURE TO STATE A CLAIM \n[if8]  Plaintiffs' Complaint must be construed in the light most favorable to the Plaintiffs and the well \npleaded allegations in the Complaint are seen as true.  Livingood v. Meece, 477 N.W.2d 183, 188 (N.D. \n1991). \n[if9]  GPI claims that either California or the District of Columbia law applies to Plaintiffs' defamation \nclaim. The Court is not convinced. Some of the alleged defamatory statements were made in North Dakota. \nFurthermore, North Dakota has the most significant interest in this case, property damage in the state, so \nthat its law should apply.  It was also foreseeable to GPI that if it defamed parties and/or property in North \n2 \n\nDakota, North Dakota law would apply.  See Kenna v. So-Fro Fabrics, Inc., 18 F.3d 623, 627 (8th Cir. \n1994). \n[iflO]  Slander actions in North Dakota have a two-year statute of limitations.  N.D.C.C.  § 28-01-18. \nPlaintiffs' Complaint is timely under North Dakota law. \n[ifl l]  Civil libel is defined in N.D.C.C. § 14-02-03, which reads as follows: \nLibel is a false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, \neffigy, or other fixed representation to the eye, which exposes any person \nto hatred, contempt, ridicule, or obloquy, or which causes the person to be \nshunned or avoided, or which has a tendency to injure the person in the \nperson's occupation. \n[ifl2]  GPI is correct in asserting it is afforded first amendment rights and that certain opinions are \nprotected.  The Amended Complaint sets forth several alleged defamatory statements.  They allege that \nthey asserted falsely that the pipeline traverse tribal land. They also allege that the Defendants falsely stated \nthat the pipeline damaged burial grounds. \n[ifl3]  The North Dakota Historical Association had already determined that this was not true.  The fact \nthat the tribe may have made this assertion is no defense.  A repeater of a libelous statement is just as \nresponsible.  96 A.L.R.2d 373 (1964). \n[if l 4]  GPI and GPF argue the statements were not made with malice.  Malice, however, is a question of \n,r \nfact for the jury.  Riemers v. Mahar, 2008 ND 95,  12, 748 N.W.2d 714. \n[ifl5]  Therefore, Plaintiffs' Complaint states a valid claim of defamation. \nTRESPASS TO  LAND IN CHATTEL;  AIDING AND ABETTING TRESPASS; \nCONVERSION; AIDING AND ABETTING CONVERSION; NUISANCE; AIDING \nAND ABETTING NUISANCE; TORTUOUS INTERFERENCE WITH BUSINESS \nRELATIONS; CIVIL CONSPIRACY \n[ifl6]  Trespass is a common law theory accepted in North Dakota.  N.D.C.C. § 28-01-16.  Nuisance is a \ncause of action authorized by N.D.C.C. § 42-01-06. \n[ifl 7]  Tortuous interference with business relations is a tort recognized in North Dakota.  Trade'N Post \n,r \nv. World Duty Free Americas, 2001 ND 116,  36,628 N.W.2d 707. \n3 \n\n[ifl8]  Civil conspiracy is recognized in North Dakota.  See Burris Carpet Plus, Inc. v. Burris, 2010 ND \n,r \n118,  43, 785 N.W.2d 164. \n[ifl9]  Aiding and abetting is recognized as a basis for joint and several liability. \nWhen two or more parties are found to have contributed to the injury, the \nliability of each party is several only, and is not joint, and each party is \nliable only for the amount of damages attributable to the percentage of \nfault  of that person,  except  that  any  persons  who  act  in  concert  in \ncommitting a tortuous act or aid or encourage the act, or ratifies or adopts \nthe act for their benefit, are jointly liable for all damages attributable to \ntheir combined percentage of fault. ... \nN.D.C.C. § 32-03.2-02 (emphasis added). \n[if20]  On the basis of the foregoing,  IT  IS  HEREBY ORDERED that Greenpeace Intemational's, \nGreenpeace, Inc.'s, Greenpeace Fund's, and Charles Brown's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint \nagainst them is DENIED. \nDated this 13th day of February, 2020. \nBY THE COURT: \nistrict Cou \n4 ",
