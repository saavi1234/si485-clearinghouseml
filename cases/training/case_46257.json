Citibank</a> (No. 1:25-cv-698) was designated the lead case. For updates after March 20, 2025, please follow the link to the lead case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case challenged the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) immediate termination of a $2 billion federal clean energy grant and Citibank&rsquo;s refusal to release the associated funds. On March 14, 2025, Power Forward Communities, Inc. (PFC) filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Citibank, EPA, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and Acting Deputy Administrator William Charles McIntosh. PFC was represented by Foley Hoag LLP.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.</p>\r\n<p>PFC was one of three nonprofit entities selected in April 2024 to receive awards under the EPA&rsquo;s $14 billion National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), a program authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act to support financing of clean energy projects. PFC received a $2 billion grant to fund affordable housing decarbonization in underserved communities. The grant agreement required funds to be deposited at Citibank, which served as financial agent under a tripartite Account Control Agreement (ACA) executed among PFC, the EPA, and Citibank.</p>\r\n<p>PFC alleged that beginning February 13, 2025, Citibank began freezing access to PFC&rsquo;s grant accounts without legal justification. On March 11, 2025, EPA issued a two-page letter purporting to immediately terminate PFC&rsquo;s award based on vague concerns about fraud, abuse, and programmatic misalignment. PFC asserted that the termination violated federal grant regulations, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and constitutional safeguards. It further alleged that Citibank breached the ACA by refusing to release funds in the absence of a formal Notice of Exclusive Control from EPA.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day the complaint was filed, PFC moved for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to prevent Citibank from continuing to freeze the accounts and to block EPA from implementing the termination. In support, PFC argued that the EPA&rsquo;s March 11 letter failed to comply with APA procedures and cited no substantiated misconduct. It further alleged that Citibank was unlawfully withholding funds despite lacking any formal or judicial instruction to do so.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2025, Judge Chutkan granted the TRO in part. 775 F.Supp.3d 335. The court enjoined both EPA and Citibank from giving effect to the termination letter or transferring the funds to any party other than the account holders. The court found that PFC was likely to prevail on its APA and due process claims, that the freeze posed irreparable harm to its operations, and that the government had failed to identify any credible evidence of wrongdoing. The court ordered the parties to meet and confer regarding further proceedings.</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2025, the court issued a minute order consolidating all three cases&mdash;Climate United Fund, Coalition for Green Capital, and Power Forward Communities&mdash;under Rule 42(a). <em><a href=\"../../../../case/46274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Climate United Fund v. Citibank</a></em>&nbsp;(No. 1:25-cv-698) was designated the lead case. All filings were thereafter directed to be submitted under that docket.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about a group called Power Forward Communities (PFC) suing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Citibank after their $2 billion clean energy grant was suddenly frozen and then terminated. PFC was one of three nonprofits chosen in April 2024 to receive big grants from the EPA’s National Clean Investment Fund to support clean energy projects, especially for affordable housing in underserved areas. The grant money was kept in an account at Citibank, which was supposed to release funds as needed.\r\n\r\nIn February 2025, Citibank started blocking PFC from accessing the funds, even though there wasn’t any official order saying they had to do this. Then, in March 2025, the EPA sent PFC a short letter canceling the grant, claiming vague worries about fraud and “program misalignment” but not giving solid reasons. PFC argued these actions broke federal laws and violated their rights because proper procedures weren’t followed.\r\n\r\nPFC asked the court for emergency help to stop Citibank from freezing their account and to block EPA from making the termination final. The judge agreed in part, saying that PFC was likely right and would be harmed if they couldn’t access the funds. The court ordered that neither EPA nor Citibank could touch or move the money until more court hearings could take place.\r\n\r\nAll similar cases were combined under one main case, Climate United Fund v. Citibank, which is still ongoing as of now.",

(“PFC”), on behalf of itself and certain of its \naward subrecipients, files this Complaint against Defendants Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), the \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 2 of 42\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Lee Zeldin, in his official capacity as \nAdministrator of EPA, and William Charles (W.C.) McIntosh, in his official capacity as Acting \nDeputy Administrator of EPA (together with EPA and Mr. Zeldin, “EPA Defendants”), and alleges \nas follows:  \nINTRODUCTION\n1. This action challenges EPA’s lawless attempt to terminate Plaintiff PFC’s award \nunder the National Clean Investment Fund and Citibank’s wrongful suspension of accounts \ncontaining federal grant funds to which Plaintiff PFC is legally entitled.  \n2. In 2022, Congress enacted and President Biden signed into law the Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”).  Pub. L. No. 117-169.  The IRA amended the Clean Air Act to \nauthorize EPA to establish the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”), a “historic $27 billion \ninvestment to combat the climate crisis by mobilizing financing and private capital for greenhouse \ngas-  and  air  pollution-reducing  projects  in  communities  across  the  country.”    About  the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund,  Environmental  Protection  Agency, \nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/about-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund;  see \nalso 42 U.S.C. § 7434.  Pursuant to this mandate, EPA created and funded three GGRF programs: \nThe National Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator \n(“CCIA”), and Solar for All (“SFA”).  EPA funded each program from appropriations made in the \nIRA: $14 billion for NCIF, $6 billion for CCIA, and $7 billion for SFA.   \n3. PFC, a coalition of leading non-profit organizations, is the prime recipient of a $2 \nbillion award under the NCIF program.  Announced in April 2024, PFC’s award will finance clean, \naffordable family housing in cities, towns, rural areas, and Tribal communities across the country.  \nThese efforts—to provide families with affordable housing and lower families’ utility bills, create \n-2- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 3 of 42\njobs, and improve community health and safety—have already begun, with PFC announcing an \ninvestment of more than $500 million to expand and preserve affordable housing, improve air \nquality, and create well-paying jobs in rural areas and communities across the nation. \n4. Under the terms of PFC’s Award Agreement with EPA, the grant funds of PFC and \nits award subrecipients (PFC’s coalition members and their affiliates) are held at Citibank, the \n“financial agent” selected by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to administer NCIF awards. \n5. An Account Control Agreement among Citibank, PFC, and EPA, and second-tier \nAccount Control Agreements among Citibank, PFC, and each subrecipient (together, “the ACAs” \nor “the contracts”) recognize that PFC and its subrecipients are the beneficial owners of the \nCitibank  accounts  at  issue.    Pursuant  to  the  ACAs,  Citibank  is  obligated  to  perform  the \n“administrative or ministerial” task of releasing funds upon receipt of a transfer instruction from \nPFC or a subrecipient. \n6. Citibank did so until February 13, 2025, roughly three weeks after President Trump \ntook office for the second time and—just hours into his second term—issued Executive Order \n14154, Unleashing American Energy (“the Energy EO”).  Section 7 of the Energy EO, titled \n“Terminating the Green New Deal,” states that “[a]ll agencies shall immediately pause the \ndisbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.”  The following \nday, January 21, 2025, the White House Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) issued \nmemorandum M-25-11, which repeats the Energy EO’s “directive” to executive agencies to \n“immediately  pause  disbursements  of  [IRA]  funds,”  including  “funds  supporting  programs, \nprojects or activities … supporting the ‘Green New Deal.’”  On January 27, 2025, OMB issued \nmemorandum M-25-13, instructing federal agencies to pause “all activities related to obligation or \ndisbursement of all Federal financial assistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be \n-3- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 4 of 42\nimplicated by the executive orders, including, but not limited to, financial assistance for … the \ngreen new deal.”  Although OMB promptly rescinded memorandum M-25-13, the funding freeze \ndirective remained in place.  See @PressSec, Karoline Leavitt, Twitter (Jan. 29, 2025, 1:40 PM) \n(“This is NOT a rescission of the federal funding freeze.  It is simply a rescission of the OMB \nmemo.”).  \n7. Multiple federal district courts have since enjoined the funding freeze ordered by \nthe  Energy  EO,  OMB  memorandum  M-25-11,  and  OMB  memorandum  M-25-13.    See \nMemorandum Opinion (ECF No. 51), Order (ECF No. 52), Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-cv-00239 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025); Memorandum and Order (ECF No. 161), State of New \nYork v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025). \n8. On February 12, 2025, the newly confirmed EPA Administrator, Lee Zeldin, \npublicly criticized the NCIF program and its award recipients.  Mr.  Zeldin demanded that NCIF \ngrant  funds—despite  having  been  contractually  obligated  and  disbursed—be  “immediately \nreturn[ed]” to the government.  He also vowed, without any specific basis for adverse action, that \nhe would “refer[] this matter to the Inspector General’s Office and [] work with the Justice \nDepartment.”  Mr. Zeldin subsequently acted on those promises and continued to disparage the \nNCIF program and its award recipients. \n9. The next day, on February 13, 2025, Citibank froze PFC’s and its subrecipients’ \nfunds.  The bank briefly lifted that freeze to process payments on February 14, 2025, but Citibank \nhas refused PFC’s and its subrecipients’ disbursement instructions ever since. \n10. Citibank has not received a court order or other legal process authorizing it to \nsuspend the accounts at issue.  Indeed, PFC understands from public media reports that, despite \nmultiple attempts by political appointees at EPA and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) to obtain \n-4- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 5 of 42\nsuch authority, the federal government has been unable to do so, owing, apparently, to the absence \nof any indicia of impropriety.  An EPA spokesperson thus stated on March 4, 2025, that “[a]ny \nfreeze on [NCIF] funds is at the discretion of Citibank.”  In a court filing on March 12, 2025, \nCitibank represented that its freeze of NCIF funds was in response to “recommendation[s]” and \ninstructions from several federal agencies. \n11. On March 11, 2025, EPA sent all NCIF and CCIA award recipients—including \nPFC—an asserted “Notice of Grant Termination” (“the Notice”).  The Notice, which states that it \nis “effective immediately,” relies on purported “concerns regarding program integrity, the award \nprocess, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities.”  \nThe Notice does not identify a single example of any such misconduct on the part of any NCIF or \nCCIA grantee—let alone PFC.   \n12. NCIF awards, including PFC’s, may be unilaterally terminated by the government \nonly in limited circumstances, and the Notice satisfies none of them.  It cites no violation of any \napplicable law, regulation, or award term; it alleges no misrepresentation by PFC (or any other \nawardee); and it identifies no “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse” as defined in EPA’s General Terms and \nConditions.  EPA’s purported termination of PFC’s NCIF award—indeed, of the entirety of the \nNCIF and CCIA programs—is thus “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not \nin accordance with law,” in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n13. EPA’s conduct also contravenes the United States Constitution.  By terminating \nPFC’s award without lawful basis and in disregard of Congress’s legislative enactments, the \nagency has violated the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause and the Constitution’s Separation \nof Powers. \n-5- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 6 of 42\n14. Citibank’s conduct is likewise unlawful.  Citibank has received no legal process \nthat justifies the freeze of PFC’s and its subrecipients’ funds.  And by the plain terms of the ACAs, \nCitibank lacks any discretion to freeze the accounts of PFC or its subrecipients.  Citibank has \ntherefore  breached  the  ACA  and  wrongfully  withheld  the  grant  funds  that  PFC  and  its \nsubrecipients have an immediate legal right to possess.   \n15. Defendants’ actions have caused and continue to cause real and immediate harm.  \nEPA’s unlawful purported termination of the NCIF program and Citibank’s freezing of PFC’s and \nits subrecipients’ accounts threaten PFC’s very existence.  PFC has no committed source of \nfunding to replace the grant funds, without which it cannot pay its existing employees (let alone \nhire the additional staff necessary to implement its workplan), pay its critical service providers and \ncontractors, or keep pace with the requirements of its NCIF workplan.  Without access to their \ngrant funds, PFC and its subrecipients will be unable to meet their obligations under the NCIF \nprogram or their commitments to American families to lower energy costs and improve the health, \nsafety, and affordability of housing across the nation.  Without access to the NCIF funds, the \nsubrecipients are not able to move forward with the projects they committed to undertake.  This \nwill have an immediate, direct, and devastating impact on the organizations’ constituents, who will \nbe unable to access affordable housing, affordable heating and cooling systems, and other essential \nservices.   \n16. PFC therefore brings this lawsuit on behalf of itself and certain of its subrecipients \nto obtain declarations that EPA has violated the Constitution and the APA, and that Citibank is in \nbreach of the ACA and subrecipient ACAs; and to enjoin Defendants’ illegal conduct and promptly \nrestore PFC’s and its subrecipients’ NCIF funds.   \n-6- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 7 of 42\nPARTIES \n17. Defendant EPA is the agency of the federal government of the United States \ncharged with administering the GGRF and NCIF program.  EPA is an agency within the meaning \nof the APA. \n18. Defendant Lee Zeldin is the Administrator of EPA and the agency’s highest-\nranking official.  PFC sues Mr. Zeldin in his official capacity. \n19. Defendant William Charles McIntosh is the Acting Deputy Administrator of EPA \nand the agency’s second highest-ranking official.  PFC sues Mr. McIntosh in his official capacity.  \n20. Defendant Citibank is a national banking association organized and existing under \nthe laws of the United States of America, with headquarters in South Dakota.  It is the wholly \nowned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc., headquartered in New York. \n21. Plaintiff PFC is a Delaware non-stock, not-for-profit corporation with its principal \nplace of business in Columbia, Maryland.  PFC, as described by EPA, is a nonprofit coalition of \n“the country’s most trusted housing, climate, and community investment groups that is dedicated \nto decarbonizing and transforming American housing to save homeowners and renters money, \nreinvest in communities, and tackle the climate crisis.”  PFC aims to expand and preserve \naffordable housing, improve air quality, and create well-paying jobs by ramping up simple energy-\nefficiency and other improvements in single-family and multifamily homes nationwide.  PFC’s \ncoalition  members  and/or  their  affiliates,  including  Enterprise  Community  Partners,  Inc. \n(Enterprise Green Accelerator, Inc.), Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC Green LLC), \nand  Rewiring  America,  Inc.  (Rewiring  Community  Investment  Fund,  Inc.),  are  designated \nsubrecipients of the grant funds awarded to PFC, and in this role are obligated to implement certain \nobjectives of the grant (collectively, the “Subrecipients”).   \n-7- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 8 of 42\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n22. PFC  brings  this  action  for  declaratory  and  injunctive  relief  based  on  EPA \nDefendants’ violation of the APA and United States Constitution, and Citibank’s breach of \ncontract and conversion. \n23. This Court has jurisdiction over PFC’s claims against EPA Defendants under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n24. This Court has jurisdiction over PFC’s claims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367, because those claims are so related to PFC’s claims against EPA Defendants that they \nform part of the same case or controversy.1\n25. Venue in this District is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because EPA \nDefendants are located in this District and a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this District. \nSTANDING \n26. Plaintiff  PFC  has  standing  to  bring  this  action  on  behalf  of  itself  and  the \nSubrecipients, including Enterprise Community Partners, Inc. (Enterprise Green Accelerator, \nInc.), Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC Green LLC), and Rewiring America, Inc. \n(Rewiring Community Investment Fund, Inc.).   \n27. As detailed in paragraphs 61-72, each of the Subrecipients is a party to an ACA \nwith Citibank and PFC, and each Subrecipient has been harmed by Citibank’s refusal to disburse \n1 Even if EPA were not named as a defendant, the Court would have jurisdiction over PFC’s \nclaims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the parties are of diverse citizenship and \nthe amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n-8- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 9 of 42\nfunds.  Each Subrecipient therefore has standing to challenge Citibank’s breach of its contractual \nobligations and refusal to release funds. \n28. As detailed in paragraphs 31-49, each of the Subrecipients is a subrecipient of funds \nunder PFC’s NCIF award, and each Subrecipient has been harmed by EPA’s purported termination \nof PFC’s NCIF Award Agreement.  Each Subrecipient therefore has standing to challenge EPA’s \npurported termination of the Award Agreement. \n29. Citibank’s violations of PFC’s and the Subrecipients’ contractual and property \nrights, and EPA Defendants’ unlawful purported termination of the Award Agreement, prevent \nPFC and its Subrecipients from decarbonizing and transforming American housing, reinvesting in \ncommunities, and tackling the climate crisis—efforts that go to the very core of PFC’s mission.  \nAccordingly, the interests PFC seeks to protect through this lawsuit are germane to PFC’s purpose. \n30. Because this Complaint seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief based on \nconstitutional, statutory, contractual, and property rights that are substantively identical as to PFC \nand all Subrecipients, adjudicating this lawsuit does not require the participation of the individual \nSubrecipients. \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nI. PFC’s Award Agreement under the National Clean Investment Fund  \n31. In 2022, Congress enacted and President Biden signed into law the IRA.  Among \nother components, the IRA amended the Clean Air Act to authorize EPA to make competitive \ngrants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”) to provide financial assistance for \n“the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(c)(1).  \n-9- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 10 of 42\n32. To implement the IRA’s requirements, EPA created the National Clean Investment \nFund (“NCIF”), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (“CCIA”), and Solar for All \n(“SFA”).    EPA  funded  the  NCIF  program  with  approximately  $14  billion  appropriated  by \nCongress—$11,970,000,000.00 under 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2) (for grants “providing financial \nassistance and technical assistance” for projects, activities, and technologies that reduce or avoid \ngreenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution) and another $2,000,000,000.00 under \n42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(3) (out of $8,000,000,000.00 for grants “providing financial assistance and \ntechnical assistance in low-income and disadvantaged communities” for the same purposes).  \nCongress instructed that these funds remain available to be awarded until September 30, 2024. \n33. On July 14, 2023, EPA released the Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) No. \nEPA-R-HQ-NCIF-23 announcing a public competition for the NCIF grant funds.  The NOFO was \nupdated on August 11, 2023 to list additional categories of projects deemed qualified to receive an \naward.  See Exhibit A. \n34. Among other things, the NOFO explained that the “competition will provide grants \nto 2–3 national nonprofit financing entities to create national clean financing institutions capable \nof partnering with the private sector to provide accessible, affordable financing for tens of \nthousands of clean technology projects nationwide.”  Exhibit A at 4.  Both individual and coalition \napplicants were eligible to receive an award.  Id. at 21.  The NOFO described coalition applicants \nas “composed of one lead applicant, which partners with one or more non-lead coalition members \nthat are named in the application and would receive subawards (in the form of subgrants) to carry \nout a portion of the grant’s activities if the application is selected.”  Id. at 6.  If a coalition is \nselected  for  an  award,  the  NOFO  explained,  “the  lead  applicant  will  become  the  grantee, \nadminister the grant as a pass-through entity for the purposes of 2 CFR Part 200 and the EPA \n-10- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 11 of 42\nSubaward Policy, and be accountable to EPA for effectively carrying out the full scope of work \nand the proper financial management of the grant (including subawards to non-lead coalition \nmembers).”  Id. at 7. \n35. The NOFO “included a robust set of application requirements and corresponding \nevaluation  criteria  that  were  used  to  assess  materials  submitted  to  meet  those  application \nrequirements.”  In addition, “[a]pplication requirements covered a diverse set of topics and \nincluded not just a detailed project narrative but also a robust set of application attachments.”  See \nEPA, Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Review and Selection Process (last updated Aug. 16, \n2024)2; see also generally Exhibit A. \n36. The NOFO also contemplated “financial agent arrangements with U.S. Department \nof  Treasury”  to  “ensure  that  EPA’s  interests  are  protected”  with  respect  to  drawdown \nrequirements.  Exhibit A at 56. \n37. In response to the NOFO, PFC submitted its application on or about October 12, \n2023.  So did dozens of other applicants.  EPA then engaged in a rigorous, multi-stage review and \nselection process involving nearly 50 federal employees across multiple agencies.  \n38. On April 4, 2024, EPA announced that it had selected three awardees for the NCIF \nprogram:  PFC, which would receive a $2 billion award; Climate United Fund (“CU”), which \nwould receive a $6.97 billion award; and Coalition for Green Capital (“CGC”), which would \nreceive a $5 billion award.  Per the EPA’s press release, with these funds, each awardee would \nhelp “deliver accessible, affordable financing for clean technology projects nationwide, partnering \nwith private-sector investors, developers, community organizations, and others to deploy projects, \n2 Available at:  https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/review-and-selection-\nprocess. \n-11- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 12 of 42\nmobilize private capital at scale, and enable millions of Americans to benefit from the program \nthrough energy bill savings, cleaner air, job creation, and more.”  Press Release, EPA, Biden-\nHarris Administration Announces $20 Billion in Grants to Mobilize Private Capital and Deliver \nClean Energy and Climate Solutions to Communities Across America (Apr. 4, 2024).3\n39. PFC developed, and EPA approved, a workplan consistent with the aims of the \nInflation Reduction Act, under which Congress appropriated the NCIF funds.  As described in \nPFC’s workplan, the initial version of which is publicly available on EPA’s website,4 the PFC \ncoalition will commit approximately 62% of its investments, or $777 million of the award, to net-\nzero emissions buildings projects.  Approximately 8% of PFC investments, or $106 million of the \naward, will focus solely on distributed energy generation and storage (though many of PFC’s net-\nzero emissions buildings projects will also involve distributed energy components).  The remaining \napproximately 30% of PFC investments, or roughly $376 million of the award, will be used to \nfinance rehabilitation and new construction of single-family and multifamily qualified projects in \nlow-income and disadvantaged communities.  Consistent with the terms of its Award Agreement, \nPFC  will  deploy  approximately  86%  of  its  investments  ($1.09  billion)  in  low-income  and \ndisadvantaged  communities,  approximately  15%  ($185  million)  in  rural  communities,  and \napproximately 2% ($24 million) in Tribal communities. \n40. On August 8, 2024, PFC and EPA entered into an Award Agreement with respect \nto PFC’s $2 billion NCIF award, Exhibit B, which was subsequently amended on December 20, \n3 Available at:  https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-\nbillion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and. \n4 NCIF Workplan – Power Forward Communities, Inc., available at \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-08/ncif-workplan-pfc.pdf (last visited March \n11, 2025).   \n-12- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 13 of 42\n2024 (as amended, the “Award Agreement”), Exhibit C.  The Award Agreement recognizes PFC’s \n$2 billion award and sets forth the terms and conditions of the grant.   \n41. The  Award  Agreement,  both  as  originally  executed  in  August  2024  and  as \namended, expressly contemplates that the award would be administered by a “Financial Agent.”  \nExhibit C, Sections III.AG, V.  A Financial Agent is defined to mean a “depository institution [] \ndesignated as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id.  PFC was required to “set up and utilize \nan Account or Accounts at the Financial Agent.”  Id. at Section III.AG. \n42. Once the “Deposit Account” was established at the Financial Agent, EPA and PFC \nagreed that PFC was to drawdown the entire award ($2 billion) from the Treasury’s Automated \nStandard Application Payments (“ASAP”) system.  Exhibit C, Section V.A.3.  The Deposit \nAccount, not the ASAP system, would then be used as PFC’s “operating account for the award.”  \nId.\n43. EPA  has  complete,  real-time  view  access  into  all  of  the  Citibank  accounts \nestablished for PFC and its Subrecipients—meaning that the financial agent arrangement provides \nsignificantly greater transparency than the ASAP system.  ASAP permits EPA to see only a \nrunning total of grant funds disbursed to a grant recipient, and not the activities of award \nsubrecipients.  \n44. Pursuant to the Award Agreement, the Deposit Account was to “consist of three \ndistinct account types (‘Budget,’ ‘Reserve’, and ‘Program Income from Operations’).”  Exhibit C, \nSection V.A.3. \na. The Budget Account would hold the initial funds drawn from the ASAP \naccount, and PFC would “direct the Financial Agent to allocate funds across \n-13- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 14 of 42\nthe various sub-accounts in the Budget Account in accordance with its \nworkplan.”  Id. at Section V.A.3.1. \nb. The Reserve Account was “intended to enable funds to be set-aside within \nthe Financial Agent for use for any form of Financial Assistance that \nrequires the Recipient to pledge or legally commit.”  Id. at Section V.A.3.2. \nc. The Program Income from Operations Account would “enable Program \nIncome from Operations … to be held, tracked, and segregated.”  Id. at \nSection V.A.3.3. \n45. The Department of the Treasury ultimately selected Citibank as the Financial Agent \nto administer NCIF grant funds, including those awarded to PFC.     \n46. The federal government has long used financial agent arrangements to administer \nand disburse federal grant monies.  Such agreements were first authorized in the 1860s and have \nbeen used regularly for decades.5  As relevant here, the use of a financial agent was referenced in \nthe EPA’s NOFO released in July 2023 and described in the Award Agreement’s terms and \nconditions.  Exhibit A at 56; Exhibit C, Sections III.AG, V.  PFC had no role in EPA’s decision to \ninclude the Financial Agent concept in the NOFO.  PFC also had no role in the selection of \nCitibank as the Financial Agent, which, on information and belief, was coordinated by EPA and \nthe Treasury Department as part of a competitive process. \n47. The  Award  Agreement  requires  PFC  to  comply  with  rigorous  reporting \nrequirements, including that PFC shall submit quarterly, semi-annual, annual, and final reports to \n5 See U.S. Government Accountability Office, Revenue Collections And Payments: Treasury \nHas Used Financial Agents in Evolving Ways but Could Improve Transparency, GAO-17-176 \n(Jan. 2017), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using \nfinancial agents to support its core functions of disbursing payments and collecting revenue.”). \n-14- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 15 of 42\nEPA  “that  contain  detailed  narratives  describing  program  performance  …  supported  with \nqualitative discussions and quantitative metrics.”  Exhibit C, Section II.A.1.  In addition, PFC must \nsatisfy financial audit requirements, which include the requirement that EPA shall “disclose \ndirectly to the EPA Project Officer audited financial statements from any for-profit Subrecipient \nthat expends $1,000,000 or more of EPA funds from [PFC’s] grant program in the Subrecipient's \nfiscal year.”  Id. at Section III.Z. \n48. Federal regulations providing general terms and conditions for award agreements \nprovide limited bases for the agency’s termination or suspension of award funds.  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.339 provides “remedies for noncompliance,” including suspension or termination, only \nwhere “the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, \nregulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award,” and even then, only if the agency \n“determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions.”  Similarly, \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340 provides that an award may be terminated “[b]y the Federal agency” only if \nthe recipient “fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award,” § 200.340(a)(1), \nor otherwise “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award,” § 200.340(a)(4).  The \nregulatory bases for termination thus incorporate by reference the bases for termination set forth \nin the Award Agreement.   \n49. Those terms and conditions of the Award Agreement provide “only” three narrow \ncircumstances in which EPA may terminate PFC’s NCIF award.  Exhibit C, Section III.T.4. \na. First, EPA may terminate the Award Agreement if PFC engages in “substantial” \nnoncompliance  with  the  award’s  terms  and  conditions  “such  that  effective \nperformance of the [Award Agreement] is Materially Impaired.”  Id.  Effective \nperformance is “Materially Impaired” if: (1) EPA issues “a written determination \n-15- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 16 of 42\nand finding … that [PFC] has failed to achieve sufficient progress in accordance \nwith the Sufficient Progress clause” of the Award Agreement; and (2) “if EPA in \nits sole discretion determines that a corrective action plan” would remedy the issue, \nEPA must issue “a separate written determination and finding … that [PFC] has not \nmaterially addressed its failure.”  Id. at Section I. \nb. Second, EPA may terminate the Award Agreement if “there is adequate evidence \nof Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined in reference to EPA’s General Terms \nand Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § 200.113.6 Id. at Sections I, III.T.4.  Under those \nauthorities, a finding of “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse” requires “credible evidence of \nthe commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of \ninterest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code \nor a violation of the civil False Claims Act 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733.”  Id.\nc. Third, EPA may terminate the Award Agreement if PFC engages in “material \nmisrepresentation of eligibility status.”  Award Agreement, Section III.T.4. \nII. PFC’s Account Control Agreement \n50. On November 1, 2024, PFC, Citibank, and EPA executed the Account Control \nAgreement, which the parties amended on January 13, 2025 (as amended, the “ACA”).  A copy of \nthe ACA is attached hereto as Exhibit D. \n51. Pursuant to the ACA, Citibank “maintains the Accounts for [PFC].”  Exhibit D, \nSection 1(a).  Section 1(a) of the ACA provides that “all property (including, without limitation, \n6 EPA’s General Terms and Conditions are available at:  \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-\n10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.pdf.  \n-16- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 17 of 42\nall funds and financial assets) held by [Citibank] for the accounts of [PFC] are, and will continue \nto be, credited to the Accounts in accordance with instructions given by [PFC].”  Id.\n52. Citibank agreed in the ACA to “comply with all instructions, notifications, and \nentitlement orders [it] receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or \nredemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts … originated by [PFC].”  \nExhibit D, Section 2. \n53. According to Section 6(a) of the ACA, Citibank’s duties, responsibilities, and \nobligations under the ACA are “administrative or ministerial.”  Exhibit D, Section 6(a). \n54. The ACA recognizes one exception to the requirement that Citibank comply with \nPFC’s disbursement instructions:  If Citibank “receives a notice, substantially in the form attached \n[to the ACA] as Exhibit A (a ‘Notice of Exclusive Control’) from [EPA] that [EPA] is exercising \nits right to exclusive control over an Account,” Citibank may refuse to comply with PFC’s \ninstructions.  Exhibit D, Section 2.  In such a scenario, Citibank must “comply with all instructions, \nnotifications, and entitlement orders [it] receives directing the disposition of funds and financial \nassets in the Accounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such \ntransfer or redemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts … originated by \n… [EPA], without further consent by [PFC].”  Id.\n55. Pursuant to the ACA, “the terms and conditions entitled ‘Deposit Account at \nFinancial Agent’ in the [Award Agreement] indicate the conditions under which [EPA] may \nexercise its right of control.”  Exhibit D, Recitals. \n56. The  Award  Agreement’s  terms  and  conditions  entitled  “Deposit  Account  at \nFinancial Agent” state:  \n-17- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 18 of 42\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this [Award] Agreement, EPA will only furnish \nthe Financial Agent with a Notice of Exclusive Control under an ACA when EPA issues a \nwritten determination and finding that [PFC] has failed to comply with the terms and \nconditions of this [Award] Agreement, and that noncompliance is substantial such \nthat effective performance of the [Award] Agreement is Materially Impaired or there \nis adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse or material misrepresentation of \neligibility status, and that EPA has initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or \npartly suspend or terminate the Federal award, as authorized in the terms of the [Award] \nAgreement. The written determination and finding and a copy of the Notice of Exclusive \nControl shall be sent to [PFC] when the Notice of Exclusive Control is furnished to the \nFinancial Agent. EPA and [PFC] have mutually agreed only to the specific process outlined \nin this term for furnishing a Notice of Exclusive Control instruction to the Financial Agent. \nExhibit C, Section V.A.3 (emphasis added).   \n57. Thus, beyond having to initiate an award suspension or termination under 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.339, the standard for EPA to issue a Notice of Exclusive Control under the ACA mirrors \nprecisely the termination standard set forth in the Award Agreement and incorporated into 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340, see supra ¶¶ 48-49.     \n58. EPA has not sent Citibank a Notice of Exclusive Control in connection with PFC’s \naccounts.  Indeed, at the March 12, 2025 hearing on CU’s motion for a temporary restraining order \nagainst Citibank, EPA, and Administrator Zeldin before a court in this district, Civil Action No. \n1:25-cv-00698-TSC, counsel for EPA represented that EPA has not, and does not intend to, issue \na Notice of Exclusive Control to Citibank in connection with any NCIF account. \n59. Nevertheless, the Department of the Treasury emailed Citibank on March 4, 2025, \nstating that EPA had “informed [Treasury] of their concerns regarding potential fraud and/or \nconflicts of interest related to [GGRF].”  Defendant Citibank, N.A.’s Opposition to Plaintiff \nClimate United Fund’s Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Ex. 7 (ECF No. 14), Climate \nUnited  Fund  v.  Citibank,  N.A.,  No.  1:25-cv-00698  (D.D.C.  Mar.  12,  2025)  (hereinafter, \n“Citibank’s Opposition to CU’s Motion for TRO”).  Treasury instructed Citibank “to work directly \nwith the EPA to establish and implement reasonable account controls to serve the purposes and \n-18- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 19 of 42\ninterests of the United States.”  Id.  It further “instruct[ed] Citibank not to disburse funds from any \nof the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, March 9, 2025” to “provide the EPA \nwith the necessary time to develop reasonable account controls.”  Id.\n60. EPA emailed Citibank on March 10, 2025, instructing it to “pause the processing \nof payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice.”  Citibank’s Opposition to \nCU’s Motion for TRO, Ex. 2.   \nIII. The Subrecipients’ Account Control Agreements\n61. Consistent  with  the  NOFO,  the  Award  Agreement  authorized  PFC  to  issue \nsubawards to carry out parts of its NCIF workplan and required PFC to enter into separate \nagreements with each Subrecipient, pursuant to which PFC would distribute funds received from \nits NCIF award.   \n62. On or about December 23, 2024, PFC entered into subaward agreements with each \nof the Subrecipients (collectively, the “Subaward Agreements”).  Each Subaward Agreement \nincorporates  by reference the Award Agreement (between PFC and EPA) and requires  the \nSubrecipient to comply with all applicable terms and conditions under the Award Agreement, \nincluding  specifically  any  applicable  “Financial  Agent  Terms  and  Conditions.”    Subaward \nAgreements, Sections 1.3, 8.1, 9.1. \n63. Pursuant to the Award Agreement, it is EPA’s right to require PFC to “maintain[] \na security interest on all award funds held by its Financial Assistance Subrecipients at the Financial \nAgent.”  Exhibit C, Section V, “Flow-Down Requirements of Deposit Account at Financial \nAgent.”    To  secure  this  interest,  on  or  about  January  10,  2025,  PFC,  Citibank,  and  each \nSubrecipient entered into a separate, second-tier Account Control Agreement (a “Subrecipient \nACA”).   \n-19- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 20 of 42\n64. These  agreements  are  substantively  identical  to  one  another.    Copies  of  the \nSubrecipient ACAs are attached hereto as Exhibits E-G. \n65. Each Subrecipient ACA notes that the Subrecipient granted PFC a security interest \nin its accounts.  Exhibits E-G at Recitals. \n66. Pursuant to the Subrecipient ACAs, Citibank “maintains the Accounts for the \n[Subrecipients],”  and,  generally,  “all  property  (including,  without  limitation,  all  funds  and \nfinancial assets) held by [Citibank] for the accounts of the [Subrecipients] are, and will continue \nto be, credited to the Accounts in accordance with instructions given by the [Subrecipients].”  \nExhibits E-G at Section 1(a). \n67. Moreover, Citibank agreed to “comply with all instructions, notifications, and \nentitlement orders [it] receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or \nredemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts … originated by the \n[Subrecipients].”  Exhibits E-G at Section 2. \n68. As  with  the  ACA  among  Citibank,  PFC,  and  EPA,  Citibank’s  duties, \nresponsibilities and obligations under the Subrecipient ACAs are “administrative or ministerial.”  \nExhibits E-G at Section 6(a). \n69. The Subrecipient ACAs recognize one exception to the requirement that Citibank \ncomply  with  the  Subrecipients’  disbursement  instructions:    If  Citibank  “receives  a  notice, \nsubstantially in the form attached [to the Subrecipient ACAs] as Exhibit A (a ‘Notice of Exclusive \nControl’) from [PFC] that [PFC] is exercising its right to exclusive control over an Account,” \nCitibank may refuse to comply with the Subrecipients’ instructions.  Exhibits E-G at Section 2.  In \nsuch a circumstance, Citibank must “comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement \n-20- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 21 of 42\norders [it] receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the Accounts including, \nwithout limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or redemption of interest \nor dividends on financial assets in the Accounts … originated by … [PFC], without further consent \nby the [Subrecipients].”  Id.\n70. Pursuant to the Subrecipient ACAs, “the terms and conditions in the Subaward \nAgreement indicate the conditions under which [PFC] may exercise its right of control.”  Exhibits \nE-G at Recitals. \n71. Any Notice of Exclusive Control, or  any other notice to Citibank under the \nSubrecipient ACAs, is to be sent to Citibank’s office in New York City, New York.  Exhibits E-G \nat Section 13. \n72. PFC has not sent Citibank a Notice of Exclusive Control in connection with any \nSubrecipient account. \nIV. The New Administration’s Attempts to Freeze NCIF Funds \n73. On January 20, 2025, within hours of his inauguration, President Trump issued the \nEnergy EO.  Section 7 of the Energy EO, titled “Terminating the Green New Deal,” states that \n“[a]ll agencies shall immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022.”   \n74. The following day, January 21, 2025, OMB issued memorandum M-25-11.  That \nmemorandum repeated the Energy EO’s “directive” to executive agencies to “immediately pause \ndisbursements of [IRA] funds,” including “funds supporting programs, projects or activities … \nsupporting the ‘Green New Deal.’”   \n75. OMB then issued, on January 27, 2025, memorandum M-25-13, directing federal \nagencies to pause “all activities related to obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \n-21- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 22 of 42\nassistance, and other relevant agency activities that may be implicated by the executive orders, \nincluding, but not limited to … the green new deal.”   \n76. Two lawsuits were filed the next  day, on January 28, 2025, challenging the \nAdministration’s funding freeze.  Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia brought suit in \nthe U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island, and a set of nonprofit plaintiffs brought \nsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.   The same day, the district court in the \nnonprofits’ case ordered an administrative stay of OMB memorandum M-25-13, pending a hearing \non a motion for a temporary restraining order.  See Order of Administrative Stay (ECF No. 13), \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00239 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025).  \n77. After the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued the administrative \nstay, OMB rescinded memorandum M-25-13.  The White House Press Secretary, however, \nannounced that the action was “simply a rescission of the OMB memo” and “NOT a rescission of \nthe federal funding freeze.”  See @PressSec, Karoline Leavitt, Twitter (Jan. 29, 2025, 1:40 PM).  \n78. On January 31, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island issued \na temporary restraining order enjoining the funding freeze.  Temporary Restraining Order (ECF \nNo. 50), State of New York v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I. Jan. 31, 2025).  Subsequently, \nthe court issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the Administration from implementing the \nfunding freeze as directed in the Energy EO, OMB memorandum M-25-11, OMB memorandum \nM-25-13, “or any other materially similar order, memorandum, directive, policy, or practice under \nwhich the federal government imposes  or applies a categorical pause  or freeze of funding \nappropriated by Congress.”  Memorandum and Order (ECF No. 161), State of New York v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-cv-00039 (D.R.I. Mar. 6, 2025).  \n-22- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 23 of 42\n79. Additionally, on February 3, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia issued a temporary restraining order enjoining the funding freeze.  Memorandum \nOpinion and Order (ECF No. 30), Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00239 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025).   On February 25, 2025, the court then issued a preliminary injunction to \nenjoin OMB memorandum M-25-13.  Memorandum Opinion (ECF No. 51), Order (ECF No. 52), \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-00239 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025). \nV. Citibank Freeze of PFC’s and the Subrecipients’ Accounts \n80. Prior to February 12, 2025, PFC and its coalition members routinely submitted \ninstructions to Citibank to disburse funds pursuant to each entity’s respective ACA.  Citibank \npromptly complied with each of those instructions. \n81. On February 12 and/or 13, 2025, PFC submitted instructions to Citibank to disburse \nfunds in accordance with the terms of the ACAs.   \n82. Unlike instructions submitted prior to that date, Citibank did not timely disburse \nfunds or otherwise respond to PFC’s February 12 and 13, 2025 transfer instructions. \n83. On February 14, 2025, having not received a response from Citibank, PFC—\ntogether with the other NCIF awardees—sent a letter to Citibank.  PFC, CU, and CGC stated that \nit was their “understanding … that [EPA] ha[d] not provided a Notice of Exclusive Control as \nprovided for under the ACA, nor [was] there any basis to do so, and the respective ACAs remain \nin full force and effect and binding upon all parties thereto.”   \n84. PFC, CU, and CGC continued:  \nUnder these circumstances, [Citibank’s] apparent and ongoing refusal to comply with valid \ndisbursement instructions is an active and continuing breach of its obligations under the \nACA. This breach has caused and continues to cause significant harm to [PFC, CU, and \nCGC] that will be difficult to remedy. [PFC, CU, and CGC] cannot pay due invoices, close \ncommitted  transactions,  or  fulfill  other  obligations  under  their  respective  Grant \nAgreements (as defined and identified in the ACAs) with [EPA]. \n-23- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 24 of 42\n85. Lastly, PFC, CU, and CGC “demand[ed] that [Citibank] comply with its obligations \nunder the ACAs and immediately disburse [PFC’s, CU’s, and CGC’s] funds in accordance with \ntheir instructions to date, and continue to do so as instructed pursuant to the terms of the ACAs.”  \nPFC, CU, and CGC further requested that, in the event Citibank were to refuse to comply, it \nprovide “immediate notice and information in writing regarding the basis for such declination.”   \n86. Citibank did not respond to the February 14, 2025 letter.  \n87. Also on February 14, 2025, PFC submitted two transfer instructions to Citibank:  \none at 10:29 AM and a second at 4:14 PM.   \n88. Citibank disbursed funds in response to the 10:29 AM instruction that same day, as \nwell as in response to the then-pending February 12 and/or February 13 instructions.  To date, \nhowever, Citibank has not disbursed funds in response to the 4:14 PM instruction. \n89. Since February 14, 2025, PFC and certain Subrecipients have submitted additional \ninstructions to Citibank to disburse funds in accordance with the ACAs, including on February 14, \nMarch 9, and March 10.   \n90. Citibank has failed to disburse funds in response to these instructions and has \notherwise ignored the transfer instructions. \n91. On February 19, 2025, PFC, CU, and CGC again contacted Citibank regarding its \nrefusal to honor the entities’ disbursement instructions.  The correspondence “not[ed] that each of \nthe prime NCIF recipients ha[d] funding requests from Friday 2/14 and Tuesday 2/18, which \n[were] pending [and] which ha[d] not been disbursed by Citi” and that “[c]ertain subgrantees also \nha[d] requested funds which ha[d] not been disbursed.”  PFC, CU, and CGC again requested that \nCitibank “provide the legal basis for [its conduct] or confirm whether it received … a request \nor … updated guidance from the EPA … or any other governmental agency.” \n-24- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 25 of 42\n92. Citibank did not respond to the February 19, 2025 email.  \n93. On March 1, 2025, PFC sent another letter to Citibank “to request that Citibank \ncomply with PFC’s transfer instructions with respect to its accounts … so that PFC can continue \nwith its important mission” and “[to] request a meeting as soon as possible to discuss [the] urgent \nmatters.”   \n94. PFC explained in its letter that Citibank was contractually obligated to carry out \nPFC’s transfer instructions.  PFC noted that “[t]he ACA contemplates only one scenario under \nwhich Citibank may be authorized to deviate from those obligations,” i.e., “when it receives a \n‘Notice of Exclusive Control’ from EPA,” and “[t]o PFC’s knowledge, EPA has not issued such a \nnotice[,] [n]or could EPA do so.” \n95. PFC reiterated that “[b]ecause of Citibank’s failure to adhere to its obligations \nunder the ACA, PFC and its subgrantees face financial shortfalls that imperil their ability to retain \nemployees, deliver on the projects for which the funds are allocated and which they are legally \nobligated to perform, and meet their other legal obligations.”  \n96. As of the date of this Complaint, Citibank has not responded to PFC’s March 1, \n2025 letter.  Nor has Citibank complied with the disbursement instructions of PFC or any \nSubrecipient since February 14, 2025. \n97. In response to a lawsuit filed by another NCIF award recipient, Citibank stated:  \n“Citi has been working with the federal government in its efforts to address government officials’ \nconcerns regarding this federal grant program.  Our role as financial agent does not involve any \n-25- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 26 of 42\ndiscretion over which organizations receive grant funds.  Citi will of course comply with any \njudicial decision.”7\nVI. Citibank Has No Lawful Justification for Freezing the Accounts \n98. As noted in paragraphs 50-72, the ACAs prohibit Citibank from refusing to fulfill \na transfer instruction unless and until it receives a “Notice of Exclusive Control.”  \n99. Citibank has not received a Notice of Exclusive Control. \n100. Based on public news reports, as well as Citibank’s Opposition to CU’s Motion for \na Temporary Restraining Order, filed in Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00698, it appears that Citibank \nhas instead frozen PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ accounts at the arbitrary urging of the new political \nadministration.  But although the new administration has repeatedly disparaged the NCIF program \nand PFC in recent weeks, it has not obtained a court order or any other legal process that would \njustify Citibank’s freeze. \n101. Two weeks into his tenure as EPA Administrator, Lee Zeldin took to the online \nplatform X to announce EPA’s intent to claw back the NCIF grant funds.  Mr. Zeldin demanded \nthat “the Bank must immediately return” the funds.  He also vowed, without any specific basis for \nadverse action, that he would “refer[] this matter to the Inspector General’s Office and [] work \nwith the Justice Department.”  EPA is “not going to rest,” he pledged, until it has “recovered” the \ngrant funds. \n102. On February 23, 2025, Mr. Zeldin appeared on a national Fox News morning show \nto discuss the NCIF program.  Mr. Zeldin claimed, without basis, that the program is tainted by \nconflicts of interest and disparaged PFC based on alleged ties to a former democratic politician.   \n7 Claire Brown, Climate Nonprofit Sues E.P.A. Over Billions in Frozen Funds, N.Y. Times, \nMarch 10, 2025, available at https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/08/climate/epa-climate-funds-\nlawsuit.html. \n-26- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 27 of 42\n103. Mr. Zeldin made attacks on another national Fox News program on March 6, 2025, \ncalling the NCIF program a “green slush fund” and criticizing the existence of the Account Control \nAgreements with Citibank. \n104. Despite Mr. Zeldin’s public statements, EPA has not obtained a court order or other \nlegal process that authorizes Citibank to freeze the funds.  To the contrary, an EPA spokesperson \nstated on March 4, 2025 that “[a]ny freeze on [NCIF] funds is at the discretion of Citibank.”  \n105. The new political administration has also turned to the criminal justice system in \nits attempt to find a basis to withhold PFC’s funding.  As with EPA’s criticisms, however, none of \nthese efforts justifies Citibank’s failure to comply with the ACAs.  \n106. As detailed in her February 18, 2025 resignation letter (attached hereto as Exhibit \nH), on February 17, 2025, Denise Cheung, the head of the criminal division in the U.S. Attorney’s \nOffice in Washington D.C., was asked by the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”) \nto review documentation “to open a criminal investigation into whether a contract had been \nunlawfully awarded by an executive agency before the change in Administration and to issue grand \njury subpoenas pursuant to this investigation.”  On information and belief, this request related to \nthe NCIF awardees, including PFC.   \n107. Upon reviewing the documentation provided by ODAG, Ms. Cheung and other \nattorneys in the USAO determined that “the predicate for opening such a grand jury investigation” \ndid not exist.  Exhibit H.  ODAG nonetheless asked “that a type of ‘freeze letter’ requesting that \nthe bank freeze assets” be sent.  Id.  On information and belief, the bank to which this letter was \nto be sent was Citibank.   \n108. Ms. Cheung expressed “some concern about the current lack of evidence of any \napparent crime and the need to send out any such freeze letter.”  Exhibit H.  She also conveyed her \n-27- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 28 of 42\nview that language proposed by the ODAG—which stated that “the government ha[d] probable \ncause to believe that the funds on deposit … [were] subject to seizure and forfeiture to the United \nStates based upon violations”—was “not appropriate to the matter at hand.”  Id.\n109. Ms. Cheung nonetheless emailed the Washington Field Office of the Federal \nBureau  of  Investigations,  which  in  turn  issued  a  letter  to  Citibank  on  February  17,  2025, \n“recommend[ing]” that Citibank “place an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with” \ncertain account control agreements—including the ACA among Citibank, PFC, and EPA—“for \n30 days.”  Exhibit H.  This was a recommendation only; Citibank was not ordered to freeze any \nassets.  After the FBI sent this recommendation letter, ODAG instructed Ms. Cheung to send a \nsecond letter to Citibank “ordering the bank not to release any funds in the subject accounts.”  Id.\nMs. Cheung refused because, in her view, there was not “sufficient evidence to issue the letter” \nrequested, “including sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the \nparticular accounts identified.”  Id.  The Interim U.S. Attorney in Washington D.C., Edward \nMartin, thereafter demanded Ms. Cheung’s resignation.  Id.\n110. According to reporting by the Washington Post (attached hereto as Exhibit I), Mr. \nMartin then personally submitted to a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the District of Columbia a seizure \nwarrant application to freeze PFC’s Citibank accounts.  But, according to the Washington Post, \nthe Judge rejected the warrant application, finding that the request and the affidavit submitted \ntherewith failed to establish probable cause that could justify a seizure order.  Id.\n111. According to the same Washington Post report, ODAG then asked another U.S. \nAttorney’s Office (USAO) to launch a grand jury investigation and submit a seizure warrant \napplication to the court.  Exhibit I.  This USAO, too, refused to do so on the ground that the request \nwas not supported by probable cause.  Id.\n-28- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 29 of 42\n112. On March 2, 2025, EPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator, W.C. McIntosh, formally \nrequested that the EPA Office of the Inspector General review the NCIF program.  In this request, \nMr. McIntosh wrote that Citibank “voluntarily paused further disbursements, aligning with the \nongoing investigation by DOJ and FBI’s publicly reported recommendation to freeze the funds.”    \n113. None of the foregoing justifies Citibank’s actions.  It has received no Notice of \nExclusive Control or other legal process authorizing it to suspend the accounts of PFC or the \nSubrecipients.   Citibank is therefore in breach of the ACAs and is unlawfully withholding funds \nto which PFC and the Subrecipients are immediately entitled. \nVII. EPA’s Unlawful  Termination of the NCIF Program, Including  PFC’s Award  \n114. On March 11, 2025, Mr. McIntosh, on behalf of EPA, sent PFC—and every other \nrecipient of an NCIF or CCIA award—a purported “Notice of Termination.”  See Exhibit J.  \n115. In its two-page notice, EPA stated that it was terminating PFC’s Award Agreement \npursuant to “2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40, the General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award \nagreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and the Agency’s inherent authority \nto reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.”  Exhibit J at 1.  \n116. Apart from the address line, the Notice does not mention PFC because the generic \nNotice amounted to an across-the-board cancelation of the NCIF and CCIA programs.\n117. EPA referenced vague “concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, \nprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities.”  Exhibit \nJ.  \n118. The agency, however, offered no evidence or allegations to substantiate its stated \nconcerns.    The  Notice  of  Termination  contained  no  individualized  allegations  whatsoever \nregarding the conduct of PFC or its Subrecipients:  It contained no allegation that PFC violated \nany constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or term or condition of the Award Agreement, see \n-29- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 30 of 42\n2 C.F.R. § 200.339; supra ¶ 48; it included no allegation that PFC engaged in any misconduct, see \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340; supra ¶ 48; and it contained no allegation, let alone “credible evidence,” that \nPFC violated any criminal law, including any law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, \ngratuity violations, or the False Claims Act.  See supra ¶¶ 48-49. Moreover, the notice contained \nno allegation that PFC engaged in the material misrepresentation of eligibility status. See supra \n¶ 49.\n119. The Notice of Termination also alleged “material deficiencies,” including “the \nabsence  of  adequate  oversight  and  account  controls  to  prevent  financial  mismanagement,” \n“allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s oversight and fiscal responsibilities,” and “the \ncircumvention and defeat of key oversight mechanisms in the disbursement of federal funds.”  \nExhibit J at 1.  EPA made no attempt to support these claimed deficiencies in the Notice of \nTermination.  Nor do the applicable regulations, EPA General Terms and Conditions, or Award \nAgreement  terms  and  conditions  authorize  EPA  to  terminate  PFC’s  award  based  on  such \nallegations.   \n120. The Notice of Termination did not identify the source of “inherent authority” \nasserted by EPA, nor any “new information” to support EPA’s change in position.  See Exhibit J \nat 1. \n121. On  March  11,  2025,  Climate  United  also  received  from  EPA  a  Notice  of \nTermination for its NCIF award that is substantially identical to the termination notice PFC \nreceived.  At the March 12, 2025 hearing on CU’s motion for a temporary restraining order in \nCivil Action No. 1:25-cv-00698-TSC, the court asked counsel for EPA to identify the factual basis \nfor the agency’s allegations of waste, fraud, and abuse in that Notice of Termination.  Counsel for \nEPA could not do so. \n-30- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 31 of 42\nVIII. Citibank’s and EPA Defendants’ Actions Have Harmed PFC and the Subrecipients \n122. Citibank has prevented PFC and the Subrecipients from accessing their funds for \nfour weeks.  That freeze jeopardizes the ability of PFC and its Subrecipients to carry on day-to-\nday operations, comply with their legal obligations, and fulfill their respective missions.   \n123. By freezing the accounts, Citibank has impaired PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ \nability to pay employees and contractors who perform necessary services.  Numerous PFC and \nSubrecipient employees’ salaries are funded exclusively through the award.  These organizations \nhave also been forced to pause hiring for essential positions, and one organization was forced to \nretract an offer of employment.   \n124. PFC has been unable to pay outstanding invoices from its contractors, including \nconsultants that assist PFC in administering the grant in compliance with the terms of the Award \nAgreement.  As a result, PFC is at urgent risk of losing these important services due to default.  \n125. The budget uncertainty has imperiled PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ ability to fulfill \ntheir missions and meet their obligations under the NCIF workplan.  Ongoing projects are \nvulnerable to collapse and future projects are stalled.  PFC and its Subrecipients cannot enter into \ncontractual arrangements necessary to advance the NCIF workplan without knowing whether they \ncan meet their financial obligations.  Nor can they issue RFPs or fund projects without knowing \nthat they have financing to do so.  As a result, PFC is at risk of failing to meet milestones set in \nthe NCIF workplan and its obligations under the Award Agreement.  This causes immediate harm \nnot only to PFC and its Subrecipients, but also to the many families and communities that will \nbenefit from these projects to obtain affordable housing, lower utility bills, create jobs, and \nimprove health and safety.  \n-31- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 32 of 42\nCAUSES OF ACTION \nCOUNT I – VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator McIntosh) \n126. PFC repeats and incorporates herein by reference every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n127. The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n128. By the express terms of its “Notice of Termination,” EPA has purported to \neffectuate a termination of PFC’s grant. \n129. The EPA Defendants’ asserted termination of PFC’s grant constitutes final agency \naction under the APA. \n130. Defendants’ purported termination of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law because, among other things: \na. EPA has not provided an adequate, reasoned basis for its termination of the grant.  \nNor could it, as there is no factual basis that could justify the termination.   \nb. EPA cited five bases for its termination authority: “[1-2] 2 C.F.R. § 200.339-40, \n[3] the General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements, \n[4] the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and [5] the Agency’s \ninherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.”  \nNone is applicable here.   \ni. 2 C.F.R. § 200.339 applies only when “the recipient . . . fails to \ncomply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or \nterms and conditions of the Federal award.”  The Notice does not \n-32- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 33 of 42\nallege that PFC failed to comply with any constitutional, statutory, \nregulatory, or contractual provision.   \nii. 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 permits termination “[b]y the Federal agency . . . if \nthe recipient . . . fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award” or “[b]y the Federal agency . . . pursuant to the terms \nand conditions of the Federal award. . . .”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) \nand (4).  The Notice does not allege that PFC failed to comply with \nany terms or conditions of the Award Agreement.  \niii. “The General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award \nagreements” include only one authority for termination: 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340.  As noted above, the Notice does not allege any \nnoncompliance or misconduct by PFC, as required to invoke \n§ 200.340. \niv.  “The terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement” include only \nthree grounds for termination, none of which applies here: \n(1) noncompliance with the grant’s Terms and Conditions; (2) \n“adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse” by the recipient, which \nis a defined term with reference to Federal criminal or False Claims \nAct violations; and (3) “material misrepresentation of eligibility \nstatus.”  The Notice does not allege that PFC failed to comply with any \nTerms or Conditions, violated any criminal statute or the False Claims \nAct, or misrepresented any eligibility status.  \n-33- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 34 of 42\nv. The agency’s asserted “inherent authority to reconsider prior \ndeterminations in light of new information” is not tethered to any \nidentified source of authority, and in any event, the Notice fails to \nidentify “new information” that could support a change in position. \nc. EPA’s purported termination of the grant has resulted in improperly withholding \npayment without first making a “determin[ation] that noncompliance cannot be \nremedied by imposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.339. \nd. EPA’s purported termination of the grant violates the statute establishing the grant \nfund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434. \ne. EPA’s purported termination of the grant violates federal appropriations law, \nwhich legally requires EPA to spend the funds appropriated for distribution under \nthe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434, because EPA has not \nsatisfied the stringent requirements for rescinding an appropriation under 2 U.S.C. \n§ 683. \nf. EPA’s purported termination of the grant violates EPA regulations and Uniform \nGrant Guidance regulations codified at 2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq., which do not allow \nEPA to terminate PFC’s grant under these circumstances. \ng. EPA’s purported termination of the grant has not complied with EPA’s regulatory \nobligation to take certain procedural steps to terminate the grant agreement, such \nas providing written notice of termination that includes “the reasons for \ntermination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be \nterminated, if applicable.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.341.  While EPA has sent a purported \n“Notice of Termination,” it failed to provide adequate notice of the reasons for \n-34- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 35 of 42\ntermination by failing to articulate any substantiated findings of fact with respect \nto PFC’s execution of its obligations, or how any lawful basis for termination has \nbeen met.  Indeed, apart from the address line, the Notice nowhere even mentions \nPFC.  \nh. EPA’s purported termination of the grant, in conjunction with its earlier conduct \nto cause Citibank to suspend payments under the grant, has resulted in—and will \ncontinue to cause—improper withholding of payment for allowable costs without \nestablishing that PFC has either “failed to comply with the terms and conditions \nof the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United States.”  2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(6).  Nor is there a factual basis for EPA to make such a showing.  \n131. As a result of Defendants’ conduct, PFC and its award Subrecipients has suffered \nand will continue to suffer irreparable injury. \n132. PFC is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n133. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), PFC is entitled to a \ndeclaration that Defendants’ purported termination of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law. \nCOUNT II – VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator McIntosh) \n134.

PFC and its Subrecipients have a protected property interest in the grant funds \nthey were awarded under the NCIF and which were disbursed into their accounts at Citibank. \n138. Defendants purported to terminate PFC’s grant without adequate basis. \n139. PFC is entitled to an injunction against the EPA Defendants’ wrongful actions. \n140. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, PFC is entitled to a declaration that Defendants’ \nsuspension and termination of the grant violated due process of law. \nCOUNT III – VIOLATION OF SEPARATION OF POWERS  \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin, Acting Deputy Administrator McIntosh) \n141. PFC repeats and incorporates herein by reference every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs. \n142. The Executive branch, including the EPA, has only those powers conferred on it \nby Article II of the Constitution and federal statutes.  Article II entrusts the President with the \nresponsibility to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.”  U.S. Const. art. II, § 3. \n143. Under Article I’s Presentment Clause, Federal legislation must be passed by both \nchambers of Congress before it may be presented to the President and, if signed, become law.  \nU.S. Const., art. I, § 7, cl. 2.  No provision of the Constitution authorizes the Executive Branch to \nenact, amend, or repeal statutes, including appropriations approved and signed into law. \n144. Article I’s Appropriations Clause provides that no “[m]oney shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 7, and \nthe Spending Clause vests Congress with the power to expend Treasury funds for the “general \nWelfare of the United States.”  U.S. Const. art.

In purporting to terminate all NCIF and CCIA awards—including PFC’s award—\nEPA seeks to cancel the NCIF and CCIA programs, representing $20 billion of the $27 billion \nCongress appropriated to provide financial assistance for “the rapid deployment of low- and zero-\nemission products, technologies, and services.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434.   \n147. By unilaterally terminating all NCIF and CCIA grant agreements, the EPA \nDefendants have terminated programs established and funded through lawfully enacted \ncongressional appropriations, without any basis in constitutional or statutory authority.  The EPA \nDefendants have disregarded Congress’s legislative enactments and have exceeded the bounds of \nExecutive authority conferred on that branch by the Constitution, in violation of the \nConstitution’s structural separation of powers, including as manifested in the Take Care Clause, \nthe Bicameralism and Presentment Clauses, the Appropriations Clause, and the Spending Clause.  \n148. PFC is entitled to an injunction against the EPA Defendants’ wrongful actions. \n149. Plaintiff will suffer irreparable injury if the funding freeze is not reversed and \nEPA’s Notice of Termination of PFC’s NCIF award is not deemed invalid and without effect.  \nThe public interest favors entry of a declaration that the Notice of Termination is unlawful, in \nviolation of separation of powers, because the public has an interest in vindicating the will of its \nduly elected representatives, and it has no interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action. \nCOUNT IV – BREACH OF CONTRACT \n150. PFC repeats and incorporates herein by reference every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs.  \n-37- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 38 of 42\n151. The ACAs are a binding and enforceable agreement between PFC, Citibank, and \nEPA (as to the primary ACA) and between PFC, Citibank, and the Subrecipients (as to the \nSubrecipient ACAs). \n152. PFC and the Subrecipients have performed each and every obligation and condition \nrequired of them pursuant to the ACA.   \n153. PFC provided transfer instructions to Citibank, including on February 14, 2025, \nand March 10, 2025.  Citibank has not complied with those transfer instructions.   \n154. The ACAs require Citibank to “comply with all instructions, notifications, and \nentitlement orders [it] receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or \nredemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts . . . originated by [PFC].”  \nSee Exhibits D-G at Section 2. \n155. By failing to distribute the funds as directed by PFC and its Subrecipients, including \non February 14, March 9, and March 10, Citibank breached the ACAs.  \n156. As a direct and proximate result of Citibank’s breach of contract, PFC and its \nSubrecipients have suffered, and will continue to suffer harm.  This harm has resulted solely from \nCitibank’s own gross negligence or willful misconduct. \n157. Citibank’s actions are causing and/or threaten to cause irreparable harm to PFC and \nits Subrecipients that is not compensable through money damages.  \n158. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, PFC is entitled to a declaration that Citibank’s failure \nto disburse funds from PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ accounts is a breach of the ACAs. \n159. PFC and the Subrecipients are entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful \nrefusal to comply with their disbursement instructions. \n-38- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 39 of 42\nCOUNT V – CONVERSION  \n160. PFC repeats and incorporates herein by reference every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs.  \n161. PFC and its Subrecipients have a legal right to possess and control the grant funds \nheld in their accounts at Citibank, pursuant to the ACAs. \n162. Citibank has wrongfully exercised dominion and a right of ownership over PFC’s \nand its Subrecipients’ property by freezing PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ funds without any \nauthority to do so.  \n163. PFC demanded Citibank relinquish its wrongful dominion and control over PFC’s \nand its Subrecipients’ property and comply with its obligations under the ACAs through its \nFebruary 14, 2025 and March 1, 2025 letters to Citibank.   \n164. As of the date of this Complaint, Citibank has refused to relinquish its wrongful \ndominion and control over PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ property.  \n165. As  a  direct  and  proximate  result  of  Citibank’s  conversion  of  PFC’s  and  its \nSubrecipients’ property, PFC and its Subrecipients have suffered, and will continue to suffer harm.   \n166. Citibank’s actions are causing and/or threaten to cause irreparable harm to PFC and \nits Subrecipients that is not compensable through money damages.  \n167. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, PFC is entitled to a declaration that Citibank’s refusal \nto disburse funds from PFC’s and the Subrecipients’ accounts constitutes a conversion of those \nentities’ funds. \n168. PFC and the Subrecipients are entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful \nretention of PFC’s and the Subrecipients’ funds. \n-39- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 40 of 42\nCOUNT VI – REPLEVIN  \n169. PFC repeats and incorporates herein by reference every allegation contained in the \npreceding paragraphs.  \n170. PFC and its Subrecipients have a property interest in the NCIF funds in the Citibank \naccounts.  \n171. Upon  providing  transfer  instructions  to  Citibank,  PFC  and  its  Subrecipients \nobtained exclusive right to possession of the funds.  \n172. Upon receiving transfer instructions from PFC and its Subrecipients, Citibank had \nno right to possess the funds.   \n173. Citibank has no lawful authority to freeze PFC’s and its Subrecipients’ accounts, \nand PFC and its Subrecipients are thus entitled to immediate possession of the funds they have \ninstructed Citibank to transfer to date, including on February 14, March 9, and March 10, 2025. \n174. As a direct and proximate result of Citibank’s wrongful retention of PFC’s and its \nSubrecipients’ property, PFC and its Subrecipients have suffered, and will continue to suffer harm.   \n175. Citibank’s actions are causing and/or threaten to cause irreparable harm to PFC and \nits Subrecipients that is not compensable through money damages.    \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff Power Forward Communities, Inc. respectfully requests that this \nCourt grant the following relief: \ni. Declare that the EPA Defendants’ purported termination of the grant violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act; \nii. Declare that the EPA Defendants’ actions violate the Due Process Clause; \n-40- \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/14/25     Page 41 of 42\niii. Enjoin the EPA Defendants from unlawfully suspending or terminating PFC’s grant \naward except as permitted by the terms of the ACA, the grant award, and applicable \nlaw; \niv.

Compel Citibank to disburse all funds PFC and its Subrecipients have requested \nsince February 14, 2025;  \nvi.

As  detailed  in  the \naccompanying declarations, the Defendants’ conduct is now causing and will continue to cause \nirreparable injury to PFC and certain of its award subrecipients, as well as to other stakeholders.  \nThis injury outweighs any interest claimed by the Defendants.  Requiring Citibank and the EPA \ndefendants to comply with the statutes and regulations governing federal grant awards and, in \nparticular, PFC’s award under the National Clean Investment Fund, is squarely in the public \ninterest.

(“PFC”) for a temporary restraining order against Defendants Citibank, N.A.’s (“Citibank”), \nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Lee Zeldin, in his official capacity \nas Administrator of EPA, and William Charles (W.C.) McIntosh, in his official capacity as \nActing Deputy Administrator of EPA (together with EPA and Mr. Zeldin, “EPA Defendants”).  \nHaving considered the motion, the memorandum in support, and the record in this case, and \nhaving otherwise been fully advised, the Court finds there is good cause to GRANT the motion \nand hereby ORDERS as follows: \nThe Court may issue a temporary restraining order when a plaintiff establishes that “he is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the \npublic interest.”  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  The Court finds \nthat Plaintiff has carried its burden to satisfy each of those factors and that immediate relief is \nappropriate. \nTherefore, it is hereby ORDERED that PFC’s Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder is GRANTED. It is further  \nORDERED that Citibank, and its officers, agents, successors, servants, employees, and \nattorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with them, are \nRESTRAINED from refusing to disburse funds to PFC and its Subrecipients immediately upon \nPFC’s or its Subrecipient’s transfer instruction, except as expressly authorized by the Account \nControl Agreement (“ACA”) and Subrecipient ACAs; it is further \nORDERED that Citibank, and its officers, agents, successors, servants, employees, and \nattorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with them are \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 4     Filed 03/14/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nCOMPELLED to comply with the ongoing obligation to disburse funds to PFC and its \nSubrecipients immediately upon receiving PFC’s or its Subrecipient’s transfer instruction, \nincluding all funds PFC and its Subrecipients have requested since February 14, 2025, except as \nexpressly authorized by the ACA and Subrecipient ACAs; it is further \nORDERED that EPA Defendants, and EPA’s officers, agents, successors, servants, \nemployees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nEPA Defendants, are RESTRAINED from impeding Citibank from complying with its \ncontractual obligations, or otherwise causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise \nprevent PFC or its Subrecipients from accessing award funds as provided for under the terms of \nthe ACA and the Award Agreement; it is further \nORDERED that EPA Defendants, and EPA’s officers, agents, successors, servants, \nemployees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nEPA Defendants, are RESTRAINED from enforcing or otherwise implementing the Notice of \nTermination issued by Defendant McIntosh on behalf of EPA on March 11, 2025; it is further \nORDERED that EPA Defendants, and EPA’s officers, agents, successors, servants, \nemployees, and attorneys, and any other persons who are in active concert or participation with \nEPA Defendants, are RESTRAINED from otherwise unlawfully suspending or terminating \nPFC’s grant award except as permitted by the terms of the ACA, the Award Agreement, and \napplicable law; it is further \nORDERED that Defendants’ counsel shall provide written notice of this Order to all \nofficers, agents, successors, servants, employees, and attorneys of Defendants, and any other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with them, by [DATE AND TIME], and shall \nfile a copy of the notice on the docket at the same time; it is further \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 4     Filed 03/14/25     Page 8 of 8\n \nORDERED that Defendants shall file a status report on or before [DATE AND TIME], \napprising the Court of the status of its compliance with this Order; it is further \nORDERED that the security requirement is hereby waived because Citibank and EPA \nDefendants will not suffer any harm from the temporary restraining order and imposing a \nsecurity requirement would pose a hardship for PFC.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c); Fed. \nPrescription Serv., Inc. v. Am. Pharm.

(“PFC”) are nonprofit financial institutions who, in April \n2024, were awarded grant funding by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to \nfinance  clean  technology  projects  nationwide.    Under  the  National  Clean  Investment  Fund \n(“NCIF”), Climate United was awarded $6.97 billion, CGC was awarded $5 billion, and PFC was \nawarded $2 billion.  The grant requires that Plaintiffs’ funds be held at Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) \nunder the parties’ respective agreements. \nOn March 8, March 12, and March 14, 2025, Climate United, CGC, and PFC, respectively, \nsued Citibank, and EPA, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and EPA Acting Deputy Administrator \nWilliam Charles McIntosh (collectively, “EPA Defendants”), seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief after EPA Defendants unilaterally terminated Plaintiffs’ grant awards.1  Plaintiffs bring a \nvariety of claims, including breach of contract, conversion, and replevin against Citibank, claims \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and the Due Process Clause, \nagainst  EPA  Defendants,  claiming  its  actions  violated  multiple  regulations,  statutes,  and \nconstitutional provisions. \nIn  mid-February  2025,  Plaintiffs  attempted  to  draw  on  funds  from  their  respective \naccounts,  to  no  avail.    They  received  little  to  no  communication  from  Citibank  and  EPA \nDefendants regarding their inability to access their funds.  On March 11, 2025, EPA Defendants \ntransmitted nearly identical “Notice of Termination” letters to Plaintiffs, indicating that EPA was \n \n1 On March 17, 2025, Plaintiff Climate United filed an Amended Complaint.  See Climate United, \nECF No. 24.  Plaintiff Climate United sues Citibank, EPA, and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin \nonly.  Id.  Plaintiff PFC sues on behalf of itself and certain of its award subrecipients.  See Power \nForward, Compl. ECF No 1. \nPage 2 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 3 of 23\nterminating their grants effectively immediately.  Climate United, Notice of Grant Termination \nLetter (“Termination Letter”), ECF No. 13-1; Power Forward, Notice of Grant Termination Letter, \nECF No. 1-10; Coalition Green Capital, Compl. ¶ 13. \nThat  same  week,  Plaintiffs  individually  moved  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order \n(“TRO”), seeking to enjoin Citibank from violating its legal and contractual obligations to disburse \ngrant money owed to Plaintiffs, to enjoin Citibank from transferring Plaintiffs’ grant funds out of \ntheir accounts, to enjoin Defendants from giving effect to EPA Defendants’ Termination Letter, \nand  to  enjoin  EPA  Defendants  from  taking  action  to,  among  other  things,  implement  the \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ grant awards.  On March 12, and March 17, 2025, the court held hearings \non the motions.  See March 12, 2025 Min. Order; see March 16, 2025 Min. Order. \nBased on the parties’ briefing, oral argument, and the record, the court finds that Plaintiffs \nhave carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a \ntemporary restraining order.  It will therefore GRANT Plaintiffs’ motions and enters a temporary \nrestraining order, though more limited in scope than Plaintiffs’ proposed orders. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  EPA Grant Funding – Statutory Background \nIn 2022, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction \nAct (“Act”).  Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818.  The Act authorized the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction  Fund  (“GGFR”),  which  appropriated  approximately  $27  billion  to  the  EPA \nAdministrator to make grants available to eligible recipients for various climate projects.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)–(3). \nIn 2023, EPA launched three grant competitions under the GGRF, including the $14 billion \nNational Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”) competition, geared at “financ[ing] clean technology \nPage 3 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 4 of 23\ndeployment nationally.”  Climate United Am. Compl. ¶ 80; see Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 1, \nECF No. 2-3.  The purpose of the NCIF was to “provide grants to 2-3 national nonprofit financing \nentities to create national clean financing institutions capable of partnering with the private sector \nto provide accessible, affordable financing for tens of thousands of clean technology projects \nnationwide.”  Climate United, ECF No. 2-3 at 4. \nB.  Climate United, CGC, and PFC Apply for and Win EPA Grants \nIn October 2023, Plaintiffs applied for grant funding through the NCIF, and in April 2024, \nEPA awarded Climate United $6.97 billion, CGC $5 billion, and PFC $2 billion in grant funding.  \nClimate United, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 48; Power Forward, Compl.  ¶¶ 37–38; Coalition Green Capital, \nCompl. ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs developed, and EPA approved, their respective workplans.  Plaintiffs have \nbegun implementing these workplans—some have committed funds to projects, see Climate \nUnited, Compl. ¶ 37 (noting that Climate United has committed $392 million to qualified projects), \nor entered into contracts with third parties, subrecipients, or subgrantees.  See Power Forward, \nCompl. ¶¶ 18–23. \na.  Award Agreements and Relevant Regulations \nPlaintiffs’ grant awards were memorialized in grant agreements between Plaintiffs and \nEPA, which include ‘Terms and Conditions’ governing, among other things, EPA’s termination \nof the award.  Climate United, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50–59.  The Terms and Conditions specify that EPA \nmay only terminate an award under three circumstances: \n(1) If a grant recipient engages in “substantial” noncompliance such that “effective \nperformance” is “Materially Impaired.”  Performance is deemed “Materially \nImpaired” if: (1) EPA issues a “written determination and finding . . . that the \nRecipient has failed to achieve sufficient progress in accordance with the \nSufficient Progress clause;” and (2) if EPA determines in its sole discretion that \na “corrective action plan” would remedy the issue and EPA issues a “separate \nPage 4 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 5 of 23\nwritten  determination  and  finding”  that  the  Recipient  “has  not  materially \naddressed its failure.” \n(2) If a Recipient engages in “material misrepresentation of eligibility status;” and \n(3) For “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined with reference to EPA General \nTerms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § 200.113.  Termination on these grounds \nrequire “credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal \nlaw involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in \nTitle 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act \n(31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).” \nSee, e.g., Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 2, ECF No. 2-4 at 42. \nGrant award recipients also agree to comply with EPA’s general terms and conditions, “in \naddition to the assurances and certifications made as part of the award” and which provide for \nsituations where EPA may unliterally terminate an award, which shall be “consistent with 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340.”  Id. at 8. \nUnder the relevant regulations, a federal award may be terminated by the agency “if the \nrecipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award,” or \n“pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by \nlaw,  if  an  award  no  longer  effectuates  the  program  goals  or  agency  priorities.”    2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(1), (4). \nEPA must also take certain procedural steps before it can terminate federal awards.  For \nexample, under 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, EPA must provide written notice of termination that includes \n“the reasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be \nterminated[.]”  Under 2 C.F.R. § 200.342, titled, ‘Opportunities to object, hearings, and appeals,’ \n“[u]pon initiating a remedy for noncompliance”—such as termination—“the Federal agency must \nprovide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the \naction.”    The  agency  must  “comply  with  any  requirements  for  hearings,  appeals,  or  other \nPage 5 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 6 of 23\nadministrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or \nregulation applicable to the action involved.”  Id. \nC.  Agreements Between Citibank, EPA, and Plaintiffs  \nUnder the grant agreements, Plaintiffs’ grant funds must be held at Citibank under their \nrespective  Financial  Agency  Agreement  (“FAA”)  between  Citibank  and  the  U.S.  Treasury \nDepartment, and respective Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between Citibank, EPA, and \nPlaintiffs.  See Climate United, TRO Mot. at 11–12; Coalition Green Capital, Compl. ¶¶ 4–6. \nUnder the ACA, Citibank is “designated and authorized to act as a financial agent of the \nUnited States” under the authority of the Treasury Department, and it administers and disburses \nthe funds provided under the NCIF.  Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 8 at 3, ECF No. 2-10, Account \nControl Agreement.  Citibank must “comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement \norders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets” and must release \nPlaintiffs’ funds at their request, unless EPA—considered a “Secured Party” to the agreement—\nissues a “Notice of Exclusive Control stating that it is exercising its right to exclusive control over \nan Account.”  Id. at 4; see also Citibank Opp’n in Climate United, Ex. 1 at 25, ECF No. 14-4.  \nSimilarly, under the FAA, Citibank acts as a financial agent of the United States and provides \nbanking and financial services related to EPA’s grant programs, including the one here.  Id. Ex. 1, \nECF No. 14-1, Financial Agency Agreement (SEALED). \nD.  EPA Administrator and Funds Pause \nOn January 30, 2025, the Senate confirmed Lee Zeldin as EPA Administrator.  See Climate \nUnited, Am. Compl. ¶ 89.  On February 12, 2025, Administrator Zeldin publicly announced that \nEPA intended to take control of grant funds disbursed under the Inflation Reduction Act.  Id. ¶ 90.  \nIn public statements, Administrator Zeldin declared that “the financial agent agreement with the \nPage 6 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 7 of 23\nBank needs to be instantly terminated,” “the Bank must immediately return” the funding, and EPA \nis “not going to rest” until it has “recovered” the grant funds.  Id. \nOn February 23, 2025, Administrator Zeldin discussed the GGRF program on a television \nprogram, stating that “the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.”  Id. ¶ 91(f).  One week later, \non March 2, 2025, EPA issued a letter to its Office of the Inspector General requesting an \ninvestigation into GGRF.  Id. ¶ 91(g). \nPursuant  to  the  agreements  discussed  above,  Plaintiffs  would  periodically  request \ndisbursement of their funds through Citibank.  See, e.g., Climate United, TRO Mot. at 14 \n(requested funds every two weeks); Decl. of Elizabeth Brafford (“Brafford Decl.”) ¶ 21, ECF No. \n2-2.  But in-mid February 2025, when Plaintiffs placed their usual request, Citibank did not release \nthe funds.  Climate United, TRO Mot. at 18–19.  Though Plaintiffs requested access to their funds \nthroughout February and March 2025, Citibank did not release the funds, and did not respond to \nPlaintiffs’ inquiries.  Around March 3, 2025, Citibank informed at least one Plaintiff, Climate \nUnited, that it had forwarded its communications to EPA and was “awaiting further guidance.”  \nSee Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 6, ECF No. 2-8 (email correspondence between Citibank and \nClimate United). \nDuring this time, EPA also did not respond to Plaintiffs’ inquiries.  See Brafford Decl. ¶ 10.   \nIt offered to meet with Climate United during the week of February 24, and Climate United agreed.  \nClimate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 7 at 7, ECF No. 2-9.  EPA rescheduled the meeting three times and \nthen canceled it without explanation.  Brafford Decl. ¶ 34.  Climate United requested a smaller \nmeeting, in case scheduling for multiple people was the challenge, and received no response.  \nClimate United, TRO Mot. at 1.  Climate United claims it did not receive any “substantive \ncommunication from the EPA” or notice as to why it could not access its funds.  Id.   \nPage 7 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 8 of 23\nOn March 4, 2025, the Treasury Department instructed Citibank not to disburse any GGRF \nfunds through March 9, 2025, and on March 10, 2025, EPA directed Citibank to continue to refrain \nfrom processing payments.  Citibank Opp’n Ex. 7, ECF No. 14-7; id., Ex. 2, ECF No. 14-2. \nE.  Grant Termination Letter \nOn March 8, 2025, Climate United filed suit and moved for a TRO.  Climate United, ECF \nNo. 2.  In support of their motion, they attached several exhibits, including (1) a declaration from \nElizabeth Bafford, Climate United’s CEO; (2) the Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between \nClimate United, Citibank, and EPA; and (3) the grant award agreement.  Id. \nThe court informed the parties that it was inclined to set a hearing for March 11, 2025, and \nhave opposition briefs  due that same day.    EPA Defendants  “asked  for an extension as a \nprofessional courtesy,” which Climate United agreed to.  TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. 10:06–12 (March 12, \n2025), ECF No. 22.  The court scheduled a hearing on the motion for March 12, 2025.  March 12, \n2025 Min. Order. \n  A day before the scheduled hearing, on March 11, EPA Defendants sent Plaintiffs \nidentical  letters  informing  them  that  EPA  was  terminating  Plaintiffs’  “grant  effective \nimmediately.”  See Termination Letter at 1–2.  EPA Defendants stated that they terminated the \ngrants  “based  on  substantial  concerns  regarding  program  integrity,  the  award  process, \nprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which \ncollectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”  Id. at 1.  The \nletters stated that “following a comprehensive review and consistent with multiple ongoing \nindependent federal investigations into programmatic fraud, waste, abuse and conflicts of interest \nEPA has identified material deficiencies,” including “absence of adequate oversight and account \ncontrols,” “improper or speculative allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s oversight and \nPage 8 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 9 of 23\nfiscal  responsibilities,”  and  “circumvention  and  defeat  of  key  oversight  mechanisms  in  the \ndisbursement of federal funds.”  Id.  The letter instructed Plaintiffs to cease all further program \nexpenditures immediately. \nOn March 12, 2025, EPA Defendants filed an opposition to Climate United’s TRO, \nattaching nine exhibits, including communications between EPA Defendants and Plaintiff Climate \nUnited and between EPA Defendants and Citibank.  Defs.’ Opp’n to Mot. (“Defs.’ Opp’n”), ECF \nNo.  16.    Citibank  also  filed  its  opposition,  attaching  seven  exhibits,  including  various \ncommunications between Citibank and Treasury and Citibank and EPA Defendants, and the FAA \nbetween Citibank and Treasury.  Citibank Opp’n, ECF No. 14. \nOn March 12, and March 14, 2025, CGC and PFC filed a similar suit against Citibank and \nEPA Defendants, and both subsequently moved for a TRO.  Coalition Green Capital, Compl.; \nPower Forward, Compl. \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nA temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Hulli v. \nMayorkas, 549 F. Supp. 3d 95, 99 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Postal Police Off. Ass’n v. U.S. Postal \nServ., 502 F. Supp. 3d 411, 418 (D.D.C. 2020)).  As with a preliminary injunction, a party seeking \na TRO must establish “(1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (quoting Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011)).  \nA court also considers the “underlying purpose” of a TRO—“preserving the status quo and \npreventing irreparable harm” until it has an opportunity to rule on the merits.  See Granny Goose \nPage 9 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 10 of 23\nFoods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc. No. 70 of Alameda Cnty., 415 U.S. \n423, 439 (1974); Shelley v. Am. Postal Workers Union, 775 F. Supp. 2d 197, 202 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(“The court may issue a temporary restraining order (‘TRO’) when a movant is faced with the \npossibility that irreparable injury will occur even before the hearing for a preliminary injunction \nrequired by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a) can be held.”); Elec. Data Sys. Fed. Corp. v. \nGen. Servs. Admin., 629 F. Supp. 350, 352 (D.D.C. 1986) (“In the context of the limited purpose \nof a temporary restraining order, the Court's analysis of these factors seeks principally to ensure \npreservation of the status quo.”). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nThe court finds that, on the record currently before it, Plaintiffs are entitled to a temporary \nrestraining order. \nA.  Jurisdiction \nFirst, EPA Defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case because “the \nrelief Plaintiff seeks is entirely contractual in nature” and “really amounts to a breach-of-contract \nclaim.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  According to EPA Defendants, jurisdiction therefore lies in the Court \nof Federal Claims.  At the March 17 hearing, EPA Defendants re-iterated this position for all \nPlaintiffs.  This argument is unavailing. \nUnder the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive \njurisdiction over certain contract and monetary claims against the government.  But the D.C. \nCircuit has “explicitly rejected the ‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring some reference to or \nincorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly within the Tucker \nAct’ because to do so would ‘deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on \ngrounds other than a contractual relationship with the government.’”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. \nPage 10 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 11 of 23\nv. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, \n672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \nIn determining whether a claim falls under the Tucker Act the court must decide if the \naction “is at its essence a contract claim.”  Id. at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967).  The \nD.C. Circuit has instructed that “whether a claim is ‘at its essence’ contractual” depends “both on \nthe source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought \n(or appropriate).”  Id. (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not at their “essence contractual.”  Plaintiffs sued Citibank and EPA \nDefendants  after  Citibank  refused  to  release  their  grant  funds  and  after  EPA  Defendants \nunilaterally terminated these grants, without giving Plaintiffs any meaningful opportunity to be \nheard.    They  challenge  the  unlawful  terminations  and  EPA’s  failure  to  take  the  necessary \nprocedural steps before terminating the grant awards.  Plaintiffs do not challenge a contract \nbetween the parties—they challenge an action.  And “exclusive jurisdiction in Claims Court under \nthe Tucker Act does not lie ‘merely because [a plaintiff] hints at some interest in a monetary reward \nfrom the federal government or because success on the merits may obligate the United States to \npay the complainant.’”  Id. at 1108 (quoting Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. \n1995)).  This court has jurisdiction over the alleged due process and “arbitrary and capricious” \nagency actions under the U.S. Constitution and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs were awarded this grant pursuant to a statute authorized by Congress.  \nAs  the  Supreme  Court  has  noted,  “[u]nlike  normal  contractual  undertakings,  federal  grant \nprograms originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of \nCongress concerning desirable public policy.”  Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, \n669 (1985).  Plaintiffs’ “claims arise under a federal grant program and turn on the interpretation \nPage 11 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 12 of 23\nof statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the \nparties.”  Maryland Dep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1449 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (citation omitted).  EPA Defendants’ termination of these grants appears to \ncontravene a duly enacted statute and interferes with Plaintiffs’ statutory rights to these funds. \nAt bottom, Plaintiffs do not bring simple breach of contract claims—they challenge adverse \nagency action.  Plaintiffs neither seek money damages nor ask the court to interpret the terms of \nany contract.  They instead ask the court to determine whether EPA Defendants’ actions in \nterminating the grant were, as EPA Defendants contend, “reasonable and in compliance with \nEPA’s rights under the Grant Agreement.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  A decision on that issue would \nenable Plaintiffs to avail themselves “of statutory and regulatory provisions and procedures that \nmay, or may not, entitle [it] to a monetary recovery.”  Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 175 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (collecting authorities). \nFinally, cases “have long recognized” that “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require \none party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money \ndamages.’”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988).   Indeed, “a claim is not for money \nmerely because its success may lead to pecuniary costs for the government or benefits for the \nplaintiff.”  Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 285; see Vietnam Veterans v. Sec’y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 534 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988).  And as is true here, any monetary benefit that might flow to Plaintiffs “would \nnot come from this court’s exercise of jurisdiction, but from the structure of statutory and \nregulatory requirements governing compensation” in this action.  Tootle, 446 F.3d 167 at 174 \n(citation omitted). \nPage 12 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 13 of 23\nB.  Mootness \nSecond, EPA Defendants argue that the request for a temporary restraining order is now \nmoot because “EPA terminated the Grant, [] ending Plaintiff’s performance and its right to request \ndisbursement of funds.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13.  The court disagrees. 2 \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution requires a case or controversy to remain live “at all \nstages of review.”  Decker v. Nw. Env’t Def. Ctr., 568 U.S. 597 (2013) (quoting United States v. \nJuv. Male, 564 U.S. 932, 963 (2011)).  “[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \n‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Powell v. McCormack, 395 \nU.S. 486, 496 (1969).  A case is also moot “if the dispute ‘is no longer embedded in any actual \ncontroversy about the plaintiffs’ particular legal rights.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, \n91 (2013) (quoting Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. 87, 93 (2009)). \nBased on the parties’ arguments and the record, the court finds that there is a live \ncontroversy, and Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot.  The fact that EPA Defendants have done one of \nthe things that Plaintiffs sought to enjoin—unilaterally terminated their grants—does not mean the \ncontroversy no longer exists.  In fact, there is perhaps even more of a controversy over Plaintiffs’ \nparticular legal rights here.  As discussed above, and at the very least, there are serious due process \nconcerns and questions of whether EPA Defendants’ actions were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, [] otherwise not in accordance with law,” contrary to statute, or unsupported by \nsubstantial evidence in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n \n2 While EPA Defendants did not address mootness at the March 17 hearing, the court addresses \nthe argument and addresses it as to all Plaintiffs. \nPage 13 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 14 of 23\nC.  Temporary Restraining Order \na.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs  challenge,  among  other  things,  EPA  Defendants’  actions  as  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA, and \nviolation of their due process rights.  In its Climate United opposition, EPA Defendants counter \nthat its termination of the grant was “eminently reasonable—not arbitrary and capricious,” and \n“the only responsible course in the interim [] to suspend further grant disbursements that might \notherwise be unrecoverable.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 21.  But based on the record before the court, and \nunder the relevant statutes and various agreements, it does not appear that EPA Defendants took \nthe legally required steps necessary to terminate these grants, such that its actions were arbitrary \nand capricious.  And when questioned at the March 12 hearing, and as discussed further below, \nEPA Defendants proffered no evidence to support their basis for the sudden terminations, or that \nthey  followed  the  proper  procedures.3    Consequently,  Plaintiffs  have  shown  a  substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their APA and due process claims.   \nThe Terms and Conditions governing the grant award expressly limit EPA to three possible \ngrounds for termination: “when [1] the noncompliance with the terms and conditions is substantial \nsuch that effective performance of the Assistance Agreement is Materially Impaired or [2] there is \nadequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse or [3] material misrepresentation of eligibility \n \n3 TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. 21:06–22 (March 12, 2025), ECF No. 22 (cleaned up): MR. SACKS: And, \nagain, the termination, to my knowledge, is based on what’s set forth in the [] letter.  THE COURT: \nTell me, can you proffer to me the evidence of commission of a violation of federal criminal law \ninvolving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations? Any one of those things? MR. \nSACKS: I cannot, Your Honor. And I think the reason I cannot is because this Court is not in a \nposition to rule upon whether or not this termination was consistent with the contracts. THE \nCOURT: That’s why you can’t provide it to me or you don’t have it? MR. SACKS: No, I don’t \nhave it. Yeah, I don’t have it.” \nPage 14 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 15 of 23\nstatus[.]”  Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 3 at 41, ECF No. 2-5.  The termination letter states that \nthe termination was pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.339 and § 200.340 and “based on substantial \nconcerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \nand misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental \ngoals and statutory objectives of the award.”  Termination Letter at 1.   \nEPA’s General Terms and Conditions allow for unilateral termination of an award, which \nshall be “consistent with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.”  See Amidon Decl. ¶ 27.  Under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, \na grant may be terminated if a recipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, \nid. § 200.340(a)(1), or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the award, including to the extent \nauthorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities, id. \n§ 200.340(a)(4) (emphasis added). \nBut as explained, see supra Section I(B)(a), EPA must take certain procedural steps before \nit can terminate a federal award.  It must provide written notice of a grant termination, 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.341, and it must “provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information \nchallenging  the action” and comply  “with  any requirements for hearings, appeals,  or other \nadministrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or \nregulation applicable to the action involved,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.342. \nThough EPA Defendants provided written notice, they did not comply with 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.342 and allow Plaintiffs “an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the \naction” when it unilaterally terminated their grants.  Moreover, as to all Plaintiffs, EPA Defendants \ndid not and have not identified a violation of any applicable regulation or any of the grant’s terms—\nonly that there are concerns about potential conflicts of interest and their grant agreements.  If \nthese concerns are valid, there are, again, procedures that must be followed. \nPage 15 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 16 of 23\nIn  the  termination  letters,  EPA  Defendants  vaguely  reference  “multiple  ongoing \ninvestigations” into “programmatic waste, fraud, and abuse and conflicts of interest” but offer no \nspecific  information  about  such  investigations,  factual  support  for  the  decision,  or  an \nindividualized explanation for each Plaintiff.  This is insufficient.  EPA may terminate the \nagreements for “waste, fraud, or abuse,” but this requires “credible evidence of the commission of \na violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity \nviolations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act \n(31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).”  At this stage, EPA Defendants have not provided the “credible \nevidence” required.  \nAt the court’s request, on March 17, 2025, EPA Defendants submitted a declaration from \nEric Amidon, EPA’s Chief of Staff.  Amidon Decl.; see March 14, 2025 Min. Order (“Federal \nDefendants shall file a declaration addressing the basis for the grant termination, [] including the \nproffer of evidence discussed at the hearing.”).  In his declaration, Amidon details the agency’s \ngeneral concerns with management of the GGRF program, including concerns with lack of \nadequate oversight and transparency into use of grant funding and in the grant agreements, and \npotential conflicts of interest among the grant recipients.  See Amidon Decl. ¶¶ 31–39.   \nAs to individual Plaintiffs, Amidon cites to potential conflicts of interest and concerns \nabout the structure of their grant agreements.  Id. ¶¶ 34–37.  These concerns stemmed, in part, \nfrom public media reporting.  Id. ¶ 33–35.  Amidon also states that there are ongoing criminal and \ncivil investigations and that the EPA Office of Inspector General has initiated an investigation into \nthe GGRF program.  Id. ¶¶ 43.  At this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained \nPage 16 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 17 of 23\nwhy unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs’ grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing the \nGGRF program.4 \n  At the March 12 hearing, when asked why the grant was terminated, EPA Defendants \nstated that “the termination is based on the information contained in the termination letter.”  TRO \nMot. Hr’g Tr. 18:04–5 (March 12).  When pressed to, at a minimum, even proffer such evidence, \ncounsel for EPA Defendants was unable to, stating that he was only aware of media reports \ndiscussing the termination.  This circular argument and unhelpful response was of no assistance to \nthe court in discerning whether EPA Defendants followed the necessary steps to terminate the \ngrant, or whether EPA Defendants had offered a reasoned explanation for the termination. \nTo be sure, agencies can decide to re-evaluate their programs, or they may decide to end \nagreements or federal awards.  But those decisions must be made lawfully and in accordance with \nestablished  procedures  and  relevant  rules  and  regulations,  including  the  ‘Remedies  for \n \n4 EPA Defendants state that DOJ and FBI have initiated a criminal investigation into the GGRF \nprogram, though they offer not much else on the matter.  See Amidon Decl. ¶¶ 42–43.  Plaintiff \nClimate United proffers news reports of the government’s thus far unsuccessful attempts to open \na criminal investigation into Climate United’s grant award.  Climate United, Compl. ¶ 65.  For \nexample,  according  to  public  reporting,  the  Office  of  the  Deputy  Attorney  General  at  the \nDepartment of Justice (“ODAG”) instructed the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office (“USAO-DC”) to \nopen a criminal investigation into the grant award.  Id.  Denise Cheung—Chief of the Criminal \nDivision at USAO-DC at the time—advised that there was no adequate factual basis for a grand \njury investigation.  Id.  When ODAG instructed that a letter be sent directing Citibank to refrain \nfrom releasing funds pursuant to a criminal investigation, senior officials at the USAO-DC again \nasserted there was insufficient evidence to justify issuing that letter.  Denise Cheung refused to \nsend the letter and resigned.  Id.  Other news reports indicate that the Interim D.C. U.S. Attorney \nsubmitted a seizure warrant application, which a magistrate judge rejected.  There are also reports \nthat ODAG sought a different U.S. attorney’s office to carry out the warrant request for a grand \njury investigation and to obtain a court-ordered bank freeze, but prosecutors in that office refused \nto do so.  The court may take judicial notice of news articles for their existence, but not for the \ntruth of the statements asserted therein.  See, e.g., Hourani v. Psybersolutions, 164 F. Supp. 3d \n128, 132 n.1 (D.D.C. 2016); cf. Banks v. Booth, 459 F. Supp. 3d 143, 149, 154 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(refusing to consider counsel’s assertions during preliminary injunction oral argument absent \ncorroborating record evidence). \nPage 17 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 18 of 23\nNoncompliance’ under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–200.343, and in accordance with the APA.  The court \ncannot find that EPA complied with these procedures and regulations based on the current record.  \nConsequently, the court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits on their APA claims.5 \nb.  Irreparable Injury \nPlaintiffs have also made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm.  To show irreparable \nharm, the “injury alleged must be ‘both certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond \nremediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  \nChurch v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Mexichem Specialty Resins, \nInc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The “‘possibility of irreparable harm’ is not \nenough.”  Id. (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  A plaintiff \nmust demonstrate “a clear and present need for extraordinary equitable relief to prevent harm.”  Id. \n(citation omitted).  “If a party fails to make a sufficient showing of irreparable injury, a court may \ndeny a motion for injunctive relief.”  Beattie v. Barnhart, 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2009) \n(citing CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. Of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 742 (D.C. Cir. 1995)); Hulli \nv. Mayorkas, 549 F. Supp. 3d 95, 99 (D.D.C. 2021) (“[M]ovants are barred from receiving such \nrelief should they fail to establish irreparable injury.”) (collecting authorities). \nThe Supreme Court has held that “[i]ssuing a preliminary injunction based only on a \npossibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an \nextraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled \n \n5 Although the parties brief multiple issues, the court need only find that Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on one of their claims for this factor to weigh in their favor, the court does not address \nthese arguments.  See Media Matters for Am. v. Paxton, 732 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C.), appeal \ndismissed, No. 24-7059, 2025 WL 492257 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 13, 2025). \nPage 18 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 19 of 23\nto such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis added) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. \n968, 972 (1997) (per curiam)).  Based on the current record, the court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy \nthe “high standard for irreparable injury.”  Church, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 138 (quoting Chaplaincy of \nFull Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nHere, the harm is not a possibility—as Plaintiffs have shown, without release of the grant \nfunds, imminent harm is unavoidable.  Plaintiffs’ financing for their operations and projects all \nderive from the grant money, which is used to pay employees, pay rent, and fund projects.  \nMoreover, preserving the status quo here is particularly important.  If Citibank transfers money \nout  of  these  accounts,  the  funds  will  not  be  recoverable.    In  cases  involving  government \nexpenditures, “once the relevant funds have been obligated, a court cannot reach them in order to \naward relief.”  City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426–27 (D.C. Cir. \n1994).  Any transfer, re-allocation, or re-obligation of these funds would be an irreparable loss.   \nWhile ordinary economic injuries are usually insufficient to require injunctive relief, \nfinancial harm can “constitute irreparable harm . . . where the loss threatens the very existence of \nthe movant’s business.”  Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Without \naccess to the grant funds, Plaintiffs have no cash or reserves available to pay their operating \nexpenses, and they have no other committed sources of funding that could replace the grant award.  \nSee Brafford Decl. ¶¶ 40, 43; Timothy Mayopoulos Decl. (“Mayopoulos Decl.”) ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs \nwill be unable to finance programs they have launched, and they will have to cease operations. \nFor example, to date, Plaintiff Climate United has committed $392 million to qualified \nprojects and has launched three financing projects.  Brafford Decl. ¶ 44.  It has: \n•  Committed a $31.8 million pre-construction loan to finance 18 solar projects \nbenefiting rural communities in Arkansas.  This is the largest commercial solar \ndeployment in Arkansas history and is projected to save over $120 million in \nenergy costs over the project’s life and create hundreds of jobs. \nPage 19 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 20 of 23\n•  Launched a program to establish affordable leasing options for battery electric \nheavy-duty trucks to small fleets and independent contractors, which will \nsupport an affordable leasing program at the ports of Long Beach and Los \nAngeles before expanding across the country.  \n•  Committed  $63  million  in  pre-construction  financing  for  the  design  and \ndevelopment of solar power plants in partnership with Tribal governments and \ncommunities in Eastern Oregon and Idaho, bringing access to affordable energy \nto rural communities and Indigenous people, creating 1,200 jobs, and spurring \nlocal economic development. \n \nId. ¶¶ 24–26.  \n \nIn her declaration, Bafford includes concrete examples of both monetary and non-monetary \nimminent harms.  Specifically: \n•  Climate United cannot currently access funds to pay its payroll and other \nexpenses related to immediate implementation of its grant workplan.  Id. ¶ 39. \n•  Climate United has had to defer compensation for certain employees to preserve \nits limited cash.  Id. \n•  Without a stable source of funding, Climate United will no longer be able to \npay its employees and will face having to cut hours and furlough staff.  Id.  \n•  Climate United imminently risks not being able to pay payroll or health, vision, \nand dental benefits, life insurance, and disability insurance for its employees.  \nId. ¶ 43. \n•  Furloughing or laying off staff will eliminate positions that perform critical \nfunctions for Climate United, including monitoring the loans that Climate \nUnited has already disbursed to funding recipients and the $392 million that it \nhas committed to date.  Id. ¶ 44. \n•  Climate United imminently risks not being able to pay rent or insurance for \ncertain offices or to pay third-party contractors who perform necessary tasks \nsuch  as  auditing  its  financial  statements,  maintaining  its  IT  security  and \ninfrastructure, and providing legal services.  Id. ¶ 45. \n•  Continued failure to access the funds would prevent Climate United from \nmeeting its commitments under the loans and awards it has approved and plans \nto approve, potentially forcing it into breach of its existing agreements.  Id. \n¶¶ 46–48, 50. \n \nAs to PFC, the freeze has impacted the organization’s ability to carry on day-to-day \noperations and fulfill its legal obligations.  Power Forward, TRO Mot. at 28.  For example, “the \ninability of PFC and its Subrecipients to access their NCIF funds impedes their ability to pay their \nPage 20 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 21 of 23\npeople.”  Id. at 29.  PFC’s staff are either employees whose positions are funded by the NCIF \naward or secondees on loan to PFC under secondment and services agreements.  Id.

Mayopoulos Decl. ¶ 18. \n•  These include contracts for legal and management consultant services that are \nnecessary for PFC to administer the grant in compliance with the terms of the \nAward Agreement and contracts for essential financial management and IT \nservices.  Id. \n•  If PFC is not able to make payment on these outstanding invoices, which it \ncannot do without access to its funds, PFC is at imminent risk of losing these \nservices due to default.  Id. \n•  PFC’s key contractor, for example, has advised that PFC has until March 17, \n2025, to make payment or it may cease providing services.  Id. \n•  PFC is also unable to pay contractors to complete, or in some cases to begin, \ncritical work for PFC.  This includes the completion of a financial reporting \naudit  and  work  improve  PFC’s  website  that  is  necessary  to  help  make \ninformation available to the public.

Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nThe final two factors—balancing the equities and the public interest—further support \ngranting a TRO.  When assessing the equities and public interest, courts “balance the competing \nPage 21 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 22 of 23\nclaims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the \nrequested relief.”  Ramirez v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enft., 310 F. Supp. 3d 7, 32 (D.D.C. 2018).  \nIf  the  movant  seeks  to  enjoin  the  government,  the  final  two  factors  merge  “because  the \ngovernment’s interest is the public interest.”  Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. Fed. Election Comm., \n831 F.3d 500, 511–512 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  Although Plaintiffs seek to enjoin both Citibank and the \ngovernment, the parties acknowledge that Citibank is caught in the middle of the dispute between \nPlaintiffs and EPA Defendants.  Nonetheless, the court will address both factors.  \nBecause neither Citibank nor EPA will suffer significant harm from a temporary injunction \npreserving the status quo, the balance of equities support granting a TRO.  Citibank previously \nanticipated disbursing the funds to Plaintiffs.  The court merely orders the parties to preserve the \nstatus quo—that is, for Citibank to maintain the grant funds in Plaintiffs’ respective accounts.  As \nto EPA Defendants, the government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an \nunlawful practice.”  TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 507 F. Supp. 3d 92, 115 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting R.I.L-\nR v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015)).  \nWhen the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of \nthe agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal \njustification for the termination.  TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. (March 12) 18:04–5.  While EPA Defendants \nvoice concerns regarding “program integrity,” “programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse,” and “the \nabsence  of  adequate  oversight  and  account  controls  to  prevent  financial  mismanagement, \nTermination Letter at 1–2, vague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.  See Am. \nForeign Serv. Assoc. v. Trump, No. 2025 WL 434415, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2025) (finding “no \ndifficulty concluding that the balance of the hardships favors the plaintiffs” when government “had \nno response—beyond asserting without any record support that USAID writ large was possibly \nPage 22 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00762-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/18/25     Page 23 of 23\nengaging in ‘corruption and fraud’”).  On the other side, Plaintiffs face irreparable harm absent a \nTRO.  By preserving the status quo, the court is not “forcing  the government to undo its \ntermination” or allowing “grantees to access billions of dollars in grant funds,” as EPA Defendants \nargue.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 25–26.  Preserving the status quo does not make these funds unrecoverable. \nThe public interest also favors a TRO.  “There is generally no public interest in the \nperpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, \n12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing Pursuing Am.’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 511–512).  In contrast, “there \nis a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  Here, temporary relief ensures that \nthe government abides by the statutes and regulations governing the NCIF, which serves the public \ninterest.

An Order will accompany this \nMemorandum Opinion.  \nDate: March 18, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan \nTANYA S. CHUTKAN \nUnited States District Judge \nPage 23 of 23 \n ",
