    "summary": "<p>This case challenges national nursing home staffing and reporting requirements. Twenty states and several organizational plaintiffs collectively filed suit on October 8, 2024, in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Secretary of DHHS, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Administrator of CMS. Plaintiffs set forth the following facts in their complaint: In February 2022, seeking to establish minimum nursing home staffing requirements, the White House directed CMS to conduct a research study, which was completed and published in June 2023. While the survey did not recommend a minimum staffing level for nursing homes, it concluded that 43-90% of nursing homes would have to add staff, at considerable expense, to comply with any minimum set by the federal government. Under the guidance of the White House, CMS then issued a proposed rule in September 2023, creating new minimum staffing standards for nursing homes and, despite numerous public comments, published the Final Rule in May 2024, entitled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, which imposed two mandatory minimum-staffing requirements.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs alleged that CMS had no authority to promulgate this Final Rule, observing that both the lack of a Congressional statutory mandate and the Major Questions Doctrine precluded CMS&rsquo; authority to promulgate a rule in this area. Plaintiffs argued that the Final Rule represented arbitrary and capricious rulemaking, and that defendants&rsquo; actions caused irreparable harm and imposed significant costs to all plaintiffs.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, in laying out its claims for relief, plaintiffs alleged the following: (1) The Final Rule exceeded CMS&rsquo; authority, violating the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(C). Plaintiffs alleged that CMS had no statutory authority, as is clear from the fact that Congress had not granted statutory authority, the Major Questions Doctrine, and the canon of constitutional doubt, to enact a Final Rule as to either of the two requirements that it set forth. (2) The Final Rule violated the APA, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(A), and therefore was contrary to law and must be set aside. (3) The Final Rule was arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. &sect; 706(2)(C), for a myriad of reasons, including that it departed sharply from previous CMS practice and failed to consider reliance interests. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to vacate and set aside both of the minimum staffing requirements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 22, 2024, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction and oral argument, to essentially vacate the entire Final Rule nationwide, arguing that such injunctive relief was necessary to avoid destabilizing further effects on nursing homes.</p>\r\n<p>The matter was assigned to U.S. District Judge Leonard T. Strand.</p>\r\n<p>On October 23, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added specificity on the potential and actual harm suffered by plaintiffs as a consequence of the Final Rule to highlight its administrative burdens. The complaint otherwise however largely re-alleged the original claims in substance and form.</p>\r\n<p>On January 16, 2025, the court denied the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. The court noted that to succeed on a preliminary injunction motion, there must be a showing of irreparable harm. The court conceded that the two staffing requirements created in the Final Rule would impose tremendous costs, but noted that dispositively, the requirements would not take effect until May 2026 at the earliest. Holding that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims on facing insurmountable financial and compliance burdens were too speculative to constitute irreparable harm, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs then filed to appeal the court&rsquo;s decision to the Eighth Circuit (docket no. 25-1097).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 17, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for preliminary injunction, pending appeal of the court&rsquo;s order, arguing that they were likelihood to succeed on the merits and would suffer irreparable harm absent injunctive relief. In that motion, plaintiffs requested an expedited ruling by January 21, so that they could seek timely appellate relief if needed. On January 21, the court denied the motion for a preliminary injunction, noting concisely that its reasons for denial were the same as in its prior opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the interim, on March 3, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment, holding that &ndash; for all the reasons set forth in their complaint &ndash; the Final Rule was unlawful, and the court therefore should issue final judgment for plaintiffs. On the same day, defendants filed a motion for judgment on the administrative record.</p>\r\n<p>As of March 31, 2025, no decision has been handed down from the court yet, and the case is pending further development and updates.</p>",

Although the nursing \nhome industry certainly has had its share of challenges, it fills a vital need in our communities \nthat cannot be replaced.  Instead of addressing the legitimate challenges nursing homes face, \nthe Defendants put forward a heavy-handed mandate through its Final Rule entitled, \n“Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care \nFacilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting” (“the Final Rule”). \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024).  This Final Rule poses an existential threat to the \nnursing home industry as many nursing homes that are already struggling will have no choice \nbut to go out of business.  And the main victims will be the patients who will have nowhere \nelse to go.  Plaintiffs represent a diverse group of States and industry organizations who aim \nto prevent this from happening. \nThis Final Rule represents not only another attempt from the Biden-Harris \nadministration to impose its policy preferences on the rest of the country but is also \nmonumentally costly and nearly impossible to comply with. During the public comment \nperiod, an outside study found that: (1) nursing homes will need to hire more than 100,000 \nadditional full-time employees; (2) the Final Rule will cost nursing homes approximately $6.8 \nbillion per year (higher than CMS’s own estimate of $4 billion per year); (3) 94 percent of \ncurrent skilled nursing facilities will be out of compliance with at least one of the three \nstaffing requirements; and (4) more than 285,000 nursing home beneficiaries (or one-fourth of \ntotal nursing home residents) will be at risk of losing necessary care if nursing homes are \nunable to increase their workforce to meet these new standards. See CliftonLarson Allen LLP, \n2 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 2 of 66\n\nCMS Proposed Staffing Mandate, 6 (“CLA Study”), available at https://tinyurl.com/yc2v4t3h \n(July 8, 2024).   \nBeyond the costs, the latest Rule from the Biden-Harris Centers for Medicare & \nMedicaid Services (CMS) is not even close to lawful. Over forty years ago, Congress \nestablished two basic staffing requirements for nursing homes participating in both Medicare \nand Medicaid. First, nursing homes participating in these programs “must use the services of \na registered professional nurse [(“RN”)] for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a \nweek.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). Second, Congress \nestablished the flexible staffing standard that requires a nursing home “[to] provide 24-hour \nlicensed nursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents.” Id. § \n1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  For decades, Congress, CMS, and its \npredecessors have considered—and rejected—proposals to replace the flexible staffing \nstandards with a one-size-fits-all requirement. See e.g., 39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, \n1974); 45 Fed. Reg. 47368, 47371 (July 14, 1980); 52 Fed. Reg. 38583, 38586 (Oct. 16, \n1987); 80 Fed. Reg. 42168, 42201 (July 16, 2015); 81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68755 (Oct. 4, 2016).  \nNevertheless, CMS proposed and promulgated the Final Rule that is unlawful and \nthreatens the health, safety, and well-being of millions of nursing home patients across the \ncountry. The Final Rule departs from the longstanding staffing requirement in two ways. \nFirst, the Final Rule conspicuously triples the statutory nursing home staff requirement. It \nreplaces Congress’s directive for an RN to be present for 8 hours per day, 7 days a week, with \na new mandate to have an RN “onsite [for] 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week” (“24/7 \nrequirement”). 89 Fed. Reg. 40876, 40898. Second, the Final Rule abandons the flexible \nstatutory staffing standard that is “Sufficient to meet the nursing needs” of each facility’s \n3 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 3 of 66\n\nresidents, 42 U.S.C. 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i), in favor of a three \npart national requirement—irrespective of facility needs, current staffing capacity, or State \nlaw minimum staffing standards. The Final Rule requires (1) total nurse staffing of at least \n3.48 hours per resident day (“HPRD”); (2) a mandate for RN staffing of at least 0.55 HPRD; \nand (3) nurse aid (“NA”) staffing of at least 2.45 HPRD. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877. HPRD is \ndefined as the “total number of hours worked by each type of staff divided by the total \nnumber of residents as calculated by CMS.” Id. Essentially, the Final Rule abandons \nCongress’s qualitative and flexible staffing standard for CMS’s quantitative requirement that \ndoes not account for resident acuity nor individual nursing home staff capacity.  \nInstead of pointing out where in the applicable Congressional statute they have the \nauthority to promulgate this Final Rule, CMS takes the audacious approach of ignoring the \nstatute altogether. CMS points to broadly worded provisions and a “miscellaneous” \nrulemaking provision that allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to impose \n“such other requirements relating to the health and safety of residents or relating to the \nphysical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B); \naccord id. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4)(B) as justification for the Final Rule.   \nThe wafer-thin reliance on a vague statutory provision does not allow CMS to \npromulgate a Final Rule that conflicts with a separate Congressional statute. But CMS’s \nillegality is more apparent because this is a Major Questions Doctrine case.  Implementing \nsuch a broad mandate that would result in at least $43 billion of compliance costs for nursing \nhomes nationwide over the next ten years, without Congress “speak[ing] clearly” to the issue, \nis a flagrant violation of the Major Questions Doctrine. See Nat'l Fed'n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep't \nof Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). And surely \n4 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 4 of 66\n\nCongress did not intend CMS to pull such an “elephant” of a mandate out of the \n“mouseholes” of either the Medicare or Medicaid Acts. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAssociations, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). This is especially true given both Congress’s and \nCMS’s longstanding policy positions for maintaining a flexible staffing standard for nursing \nhomes. \nBeyond the statutory problems with the Final Rule, it is also the very definition of \narbitrary and capricious rulemaking because (1) it represents a sharp departure from past CMS \npolicy without reasoned explanation, (2) CMS did not consider reliance interests when \npromulgating the Final Rule and (3) CMS did not consider important aspects of the problem \nsuch as the cost of, and impossibility of complying with, the Final Rule.  In short, there is no \nuniverse in which this Final Rule is lawful. \nThe Final Rule also causes harm to both organizational and State plaintiffs in this case, \nand much of that harm is irreparable.  As noted above, the costs are impossible for many \nnursing homes to comply with. And although the Final Rule claims to have an extended \nimplementation period, many nursing homes bear those costs now. This is because CMS \nrequires nursing homes to conduct unreasonable enhanced facility assessments (EFA) within \n60 days of publication of the Final Rule.  These assessments are costing each nursing \nsignificant amounts of money and labor in order to comply.  And even though the staffing \nrequirements have a 2-3-year implementation period depending on the region, the reality of a \ntight labor market requires nursing homes to hire immediately because the available supply of \nnurses will dwindle as the implementation date approaches. Some nursing homes have had to \nimmediately increasing their staffing and incurred significant costs. Similarly, states have \ntheir own enhanced reporting requirements for their Medicaid programs. Although CMS \n5 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 5 of 66\n\nclaims to have a delayed implementation period for this portion of the Final Rule, states have \nalso had to start immediately implementing these requirements.  The Final Rule acknowledges \nas much by pointing to costs states will incur in year one.   \nPlaintiffs have no option but to seek relief through this Court and request this Court to \nvacate, set aside, and permanently enjoin the Final Rule.  In the interim, the Plaintiffs will \nseek to preliminary enjoin the Final Rule to spare them the irreparable harm they are already \nfacing and will continue to face in the future. \nTHE PARTIES \n1.

Plaintiffs are challenging a final agency action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(13) \nand 704 (2018).  \nBACKGROUND \nA.   Medicare and Medicaid Statutes \n49.  In 1965, Congress established the Medicare and Medicaid programs by amending \nthe Social Security Act. See Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (July 30, 1965).  \n16 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 16 of 66\n\n50.  Medicare is a federal program that provides healthcare coverage to individuals 65 \nor older, as well as those with certain disabilities or conditions. See 42 U.S.C. § 1395c.  \n51.  Medicaid, on the other hand, is a joint federal-state program offering healthcare \ncoverage to low-income individuals. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1, 1396a.  \n52.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicare must comply with the \nstatutory requirements for “skilled nursing facilities” (“SNFs”) provided for at 42 U.S.C. § \n1395i-3.  \n53.  Those participating in Medicaid must meet similar requirements for “nursing \nfacilities” (“NFs”) set forth at 42 U.S.C. § 1396r.  \n54.  Together, “skilled nursing facilities” covered under Medicare, and “nursing \nfacilities” covered under Medicaid are often collectively referred to as “long-term care” \n(“LTC”) facilities. See, e.g. 87 Fed. Reg. 22720, 22790 (Apr. 15, 2022). Referring to both \ntypes of facilities as LTCs is convenient because the statutory language for both Medicare and \nMedicaid requirements are largely parallel.  \n55.  CMS has issued consolidated regulations applicable to all LTC facilities \nparticipating in either or both Medicare and Medicaid. See e.g. 42 C.F.R. § 483.1.  \n56.  Under the Medicaid statute, a state may waive the staffing requirements for an \nLTC facility if it cannot meet them, provided certain conditions are met: (1) the LTC facility \nmust demonstrate to the state that, despite diligent efforts, it was unable to recruit suitable \npersonnel; (2) granting a waiver will not compromise the health or safety of the LTC facility’s \nresidents; (3) during times when an RN is unavailable, an RN must be able to respond to calls \nfrom the LTC facility; (4) the state agency must notify the state long term care ombudsman \n17 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 17 of 66\n\nabout the waiver; and (5) the LTC facility must inform its residents and family about the \nwaiver. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(ii)(I)-(V).  \n57.  Similarly, under the Medicaid statute, LTC facilities are addressed in 42 U.S.C. § \n1396r(b)(4)(C), also entitled “Required nursing care.” This section mandates that LTC \nfacilities provide necessary services and activities to achieve or maintain the highest practical \nwell-being of each resident. Both the Medicare and the Medicaid emphasize the importance of \nquality care.  \n58.  LTC facilities participating in either Medicare or Medicaid are required to utilize \nthe services of a registered professional nurse for “at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a \nweek.” See 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) (Medicare); accord id. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(II) \n(Medicaid). \n59.  They are required to provide 24-hour licensed nursing services that are “sufficient \nto meet the nursing needs of their residents.” See 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) (Medicare); \naccord id. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I) (Medicaid).  \n60.  Under the Medicare statute, the Secretary of HHS is authorized to waive the \nrequirement for LTC facilities to employ an RN for more than 40 hours per week if: (1) the \nfacility is “located in a rural area where the supply of skilled nursing services is insufficient to \nmeet the needs” of local residents; (2) “the facility has one full-time RN who is regularly on \nduty at the [LTC] for 40 hours [per] week”; (3) the LTC facility has patients whose physicians \nhave indicated that they do not require an RN or physician for 48 hours, or it has arranged for \nan RN or physician to provide necessary services when the full-time nurse is unavailable; (4) \n“the Secretary provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term care ombudsman …”; and \n18 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 18 of 66\n\n(5) the facility that is granted the waiver notifies residents of the LTC facility and their \nfamilies of the waiver. See generally 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(ii)(I)-(V). \n61.  Waivers of staffing requirements under the Medicaid statute are subject to annual \nreview by the State and Secretary of HHS. Id. If a state is found to regularly grant waivers \nwithout facilities making diligent efforts to meet staffing requirements, the Secretary “shall \nassume and exercise the authority of the State to grant waivers.” Id. \n62.  Neither the Medicare nor Medicaid statutes grant the Secretary the authority to \nestablish a uniform HPRD requirement across all LTC facilities, irrespective of the actual \nneeds of their residents or the idiosyncrasies of each facility. Rather, these statutes require \nnursing services that “are sufficient to meet the nursing needs” of each facility’s residents. See \n42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I).  \n63.  Neither statute authorizes the Secretary to impose standardized HPRD \nrequirements for RN staffing at every LTC facility across the country, regardless of their \nresidents’ specific needs or the idiosyncrasies of each LTC facility. Id.  \n64.  Neither statute authorizes the Secretary to impose standardized HPRD \nrequirements for NA staffing at every LTC facility across the country, regardless of their \nresidents’ specific needs or the idiosyncrasies of each LTC facility. Id.  \n65.  Neither statute authorizes the Secretary to alter or increase the hour requirement \nfor LTC facilities to employ the services of a registered professional nurse beyond “at least 8 \nconsecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” Id.  \nB.   Statutory and Regulatory History of Nursing Staff Requirements   \n66.  For over fifty years, Congress has been at the helm of deciding the requisite \nstaffing requirements for nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid. In 1972, \n19 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 19 of 66\n\nCongress amended the Social Security Act to declare that all LTC facilities participating in \nMedicare or Medicaid provide “24-hour nurse service[s] which is sufficient” to meet patient \nneeds, including employing at least one registered professional nurse full-time. Pub. L. No. \n92-603, § 278, 86 Stat. 1329, 1424-27 (1972). \n67.  The amendments also introduced nurse-staffing waiver provisions for rural \nfacilities under specific conditions. See id. § 267, 86 Stat. at 1450. \n68.  The Department of Health, Education and Welfare (predecessor of HHS), through \nits Social Security Administration (“SSA”), proposed regulations in 1973 that aligned with \nthese statutory requirements. See 38 Fed. Reg. 18620 (July 12, 1973).  \n69.  At the same time, during the notice-and-comment period, the SSA received public \ninput urging it to deviate from Congress’s flexible (qualitative) approach for a staffing \nrequirement that all nursing homes implement a rigid (quantitative) nurse-to-patient ratio. See \n39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, 1974).  \n70.  Despite calls for these specific nurse-to-patient ratios, the SSA rejected such a \nuniform approach, citing the variability in facility needs and the potential negative impacts of \narbitrary staffing quotas. Id.  \n71.  SSA reasoned that “the variation from facility to facility in the composition of its \nnursing staff, physical layout, patient needs and the services necessary to meet those needs \nprecludes setting [a specific ratio].” Id.  Moreover, “[a] minimum ratio could result in all \nfacilities striving only to reach that minimum and could result in other facilities hiring \nunneeded staff to satisfy an arbitrary ratio figure.” Id. \n20 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 20 of 66\n\n72.  Later, in 1980, HHS took over the administration of Medicare and Medicaid \nservices. It proposed a “general revision” of the regulation governing the participation of LTC \nfacilities in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. See 45 Fed. Reg. 47368 (July 14, 1980).  \n73.  However, HHS declined to implement any specific staffing ratios, but rather \n“retain[ed] the language in the existing regulations” that mirrored those statutes which called \nfor “adequate staff to meet patient needs” Id. at 47371; see also id. at 47387 (requiring “24-\nhour nursing service with a sufficient number of qualified nursing personnel to meet the total \nnursing needs of the patient,” and a registered nurse working full time for 7 days a week). \n74.  In 1987, Congress—and not HHS—redefined nursing home categories and \nimposed uniform staffing requirements on LTC facilities under Medicare and Medicaid by \nrequiring a registered nurse on duty for at least eight hours per day, seven days a week. See \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, § 4201(a), 101 Stat. 1330-\n161; accord id. § 4211(a), 101 Stat. 1330-186 (Dec. 22, 1987). \n75.  Congress further refined nursing home legislation by introducing waiver \nprovisions and commissioning studies to analyze staffing requirements. These studies aimed \nto “determine the appropriateness of establishing minimum caregiver to resident ratios” for \nLTC facilities. See Pub. L. No. 101-508, §§ 4008(h), 4801(a), 104 Stat. 1338 (1990)).  \n76.  Yet no mandatory ratios or staffing requirements were implemented, and CMS \ncontinuously administered the staffing standards established by Congress without incident. \nSee 42 C.F.R. § 483.35(a)-(b) (2016).  \n77.  In 2016, CMS once again dismissed the push for mandatory staffing ratios in LTC \nfacilities and for the 24/7 RN requirement. See 81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68754-56 (Oct. 4, 2016).  \n21 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 21 of 66\n\n78.  It concluded that a “one-size-fits-all approach” to staffing was not only \n“inappropriate[,]” but also that “mandatory ratios” and a “24/7 RN presence” were \nconcerning. Id. at 68754-56, 68758; see also 80 Fed. Reg. 42168, 42201 (July 16, 2015) \n(emphasizing the importance of taking resident acuity levels into account”).  \n79.  Specifically, CMS expressed concerns about mandatory ratios and the 24/7 \nrequirement because “LTC facilities [vary] in their structure and in their resident \npopulations.” Id.  \n80.  CMS determined that the “focus” of its regulations “should be on the skill sets \nand specific competencies of assigned staff to provide the nursing care a resident needs rather \nthan a static number of staff or hours of nursing care.” 80 Fed. Reg. at 42201. And \n“establishing a specific number of staff or hours of nursing care could result in staffing to that \nnumber rather than to the needs of the resident population.” Id. \n81.  CMS also found that having a 24/7 RN requirement “could negatively impact the \ndevelopment of innovative care options, particular[ly] in smaller, more home-like settings,” \nand that “geographic disparity in supply could make such a mandate particularly challenging \nin some rural and underserved areas.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 68755. \n82.  Indeed, LTC facilities differ and vary across the country. CMS found that obvious \nwhen it succinctly explained its rejection of the one-size-fits-all staffing requirement: “The \ncare needs of each of these populations are different. Facilities range in size from the very \nsmall to the very large. The capabilities of these facilities are [] different.”  Id. at 68755.   \n83.  Because of the variation in LTC facility needs across the country, LTC facility \nminimum staffing requirements are handled differently across states. As CMS acknowledged, \n22 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 22 of 66\n\nthere is “widespread variability in existing minimum staffing standards” adopted by 38 States \nand the District of Columbia. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40880.  \nTHE FINAL RULE \n84.  In February 2022, the Biden-Harris Administration departed from these decades \nof practice to establish a “reform” that would “establish a minimum nursing home staffing \nrequirement.” White House, FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and \nQuality of Care in the Nation’s Nursing Homes (Feb. 28, 2022) (“White House Fact Sheet”).1  \n85.  In doing so, the administration directed CMS to conduct a research study to \ndetermine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care. Id.    \nA. The Abt Study \n86.  In response to this directive, CMS contracted with a private firm, Abt Associates, \nto perform a “mixed-methods Nursing Home Staffing Study” as a party of CMS’s goal of \nidentifying a minimum staffing requirement.2 The goal was to issue proposed rules by \nFebruary 2023 and establish minimum standards for staffing adequacy. See Supra, White \nHouse Fact Sheet.  \n87.  However, the truncated Abt Study was “conducted on a compressed timeframe” \nwith data collected between June of 2022 through December of 2022. Abt Study at xix. \nStrikingly, “the short duration reflect[ed] the time-sensitive nature of the study and CMS’s \ntimeline for proposing a minimum staffing requirement in support of the Presidential \ninitiative.” Id.  \n \n1 The White House, FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality of Care in \nthe Nation’s Nursing Homes (Feb. 28, 2022), available at https://tinyurl.com/3626wt8k \n2 Abt Associates, Nursing Home Staffing Study: Comprehensive Report (June 2023) (“Abt Study”) \nat viii, available https://tinyurl.com/b2ehy528 \n23 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 23 of 66\n\n88.  The study was completed and published in June of 2023. Consistent with the \ndecades of prior practice and contrary to the directive of the Biden-Harris Administration, the \nAbt Study did “not identif[y] a minimum staffing level to ensure safe and quality care.” Abt \nStudy at 115.  \n89.  According to the study, if a minimum staffing level was to be implemented, \n“[n]ursing homes [would] face barriers to hiring, primarily [with] workforce shortages and \ncompetition from staffing agencies.” Id. at xi; see also, e.g., id. at xii, xiv, 19, 31-32, 115.  \n90.  Furthermore, it concluded that between 43 and 90 percent of nursing homes \nwould have to add more staff to comply with a federal minimum staffing requirement. Id. at \n113. It also predicted that a federal minimum staffing requirement could cost the nursing \nhome industry up to $6.8 billion in compliance costs each year. Id. And that annual total \nsalaries per nursing home would have to increase from as low as $316,000 to $693,000 in \norder to comply. Id. at 113-14.  \n91.  Nowhere in the study did Abt Associates conclude that a minimum staffing \nrequirement would result in definitive benefits. The Abt Study provides data for only \n“potential minimum staffing requirement benefits” and for “potential barriers to and \nunintended consequences of [an] implementation.” Abt Study at 121 (emphasis added). \n92.  Nowhere in the study did Abt Associates conclude that a federally mandated \nminimum staffing requirement would actually provide better healthcare outcomes for nursing \nhome residents. Rather, the reviewed literature “underscored” that there was no “clear \neviden[tiary] basis for setting a minimum staffing level.” Abt Study at xi.  \n93.  Moreover, the staffing study did not find the implementation of a federally \nmandated minimum staffing requirement to be feasible without considering factors such as \n24 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 24 of 66\n\nvariations in resident acuity, ongoing staffing shortages, compliance costs, and the diverse \ncircumstances affecting quality patient care. Id. at 32.  \n94.  That is not surprising given CMS’s past positions that rejected calls to impose a \none-size-fits-all approach. See e.g. 39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, 1974) (explaining that \nthe variation in patients’ needs is a valid basis to reject setting a specific staff-to-patient ratio); \n45 Fed. Reg. 47368, 47371 (July 14, 1980) (rejecting nursing staff ratios or minimum number \nof nursing hours per patient day because of the lack of conclusive evidence supporting the \nimplementation of a minimum staffing requirement); 52 Fed. Reg. 38583, 38586 (Oct. 16, \n1987) (explaining that a 24-hour nursing requirement would be impractical and that a nurse \nstaffing requirement should be sensitive to the “patient mix”) ; 80 Fed. Reg. 42168, 42201 \n(July 16, 2015) (“We believe that the focus should be on the skill sets and specific \ncompetencies of assigned staff to provide the nursing care a resident needs rather than a static \nnumber of staff or hours of nursing care that does not consider resident characteristics such as \nstability, intensity and acuity and staffing abilities including professional characteristics, skill \nsets and staff mix.”); 81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68755 (Oct. 4, 2016) (“[w]e do not agree that we \nshould establish minimum staffing ratios at this time . . . [t]his is a complex issue and we do \nnot agree that a ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach is best . . . [o]ur approach would require that \nfacilities take into account the number of residents in the facility, those residents’ acuity and \ndiagnosis.”). \n95.  As a result, the Abt Study never came to a definitive conclusion that supported a \nnational, one-size-fits-all approach to minimum staffing requirements that the Biden-Harris \nAdministration was hoping to achieve.  \n25 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 25 of 66\n\n96.  Rather, there was no “specific evidence” that a minimum nursing staff level could \nbe feasibly implemented. Id. at 111. Troublingly, the study disregarded the ongoing “national \nhealth care staff shortages” and “current hiring challenges” that present barriers to nursing \nhomes—which would make compliance with a new federal staffing requirement impractical. \nId. at xxi.  \n97.  The study acknowledged but ultimately ignored several potential unintended \nconsequences of implementing a national minimum staffing requirement. These include: (1) \nthe possibility that nursing homes might be unable to achieve the one-size-fits-all staffing \nlevels; (2) LTC facilities could be limited in resident admissions because of staff-to-patient \nratios; or (3) nursing homes might even close down entirely, thereby potentially reducing \naccess to care.  Id.  \nB. Promulgation of the Final Rule \n98.  In lockstep with marching orders from the Biden-Harris Administration, CMS \nissued a proposed rule in September of 2023 that introduced new minimum staffing standards \nfor LTC facilities. See 88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (Sept. 6, 2023). \n99.  Despite the 46,000 public comments—some of which informing CMS that the \nproposed rule exceeded CMS’s statutory authority, contravened Congress’s considered \ndecision to keep flexible staffing standards, and failed to consider the barriers nursing homes \nwould face with compliance—CMS published the Final Rule in May of 2024. See Medicare \nand Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and \nMedicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024).  \n26 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 26 of 66\n\n100.  CMS claims that the minimum staffing standard is supported by “literature \nevidence, analysis of staffing data and health outcomes, discussions with residents, staff, and \nindustry.” See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877.  \n101.  Citing the inconclusive and truncated six-month Abt Study, CMS claims that this \nwas enough to conclude that an overly-broad and onerous staffing requirement was necessary. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. at 40881, 40877.  \n102.  Yet, CMS acknowledges that “[t]here is no clear, consistent, and universal \nmethodology for setting specific minimum staffing standards” as evidenced by the 38 states \nand the District of Columbia that have adopted their own nurse-to-patient ratios. Id. at 40881.  \n103.  Notwithstanding the variability across the minimum staffing requirements \ndifferent states employ, the inconclusive determination of the Abt Study, or the consistent \nrejection of a one-size-fits-all staffing requirement for over fifty years, CMS published the \nFinal Rule. \n104.  CMS asserts that “various provisions” across 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3 and 1396r \ncontain “separate authority” to impose the Final Rule. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40879, 40890-9. \n1. The Secretary may impose “such other requirements relating to the health and \nsafety of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B); accord id. § 1396r(d)(4)(B).  \n \n2. An LTC facility “must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the \nhighest practicable physical, mental, and psychological well-being of each resident in \naccordance with a written plan of care.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(2); accord id. § 1396r(b)(2).  \n \n3. An LTC facility “must care for its residents in such a manner and in such an \nenvironment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each \nresident.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(1)(A); accord id. § 1396r(b)(1)(A).  \n \n \n \n27 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 27 of 66\n\nC. The Final Rule’s Provisions \n105. The Final Rule imposes two mandatory minimum-staffing requirements on LTC \nfacilities. \n106.  First, the Final Rule triples the required hours per day of RN services. Both the \nMedicare and Medicaid statutes require that LTC facilities “[u]se the services of [an RN] for \nat least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. \n§ 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i). But the Final Rule requires LTC facilities to have an RN “onsite 24 hours \nper day, for 7 days a week that is available to provide direct resident care” (“24/7 \nrequirement”). 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997. \n107.  Second, the Final Rule abandons the flexible, qualitative statutory requirement \nthat LTC facilities “provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to meet the \nnursing needs of its residents.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. § \n1396r(b)(4)(C)(i). Instead, the Final Rule now requires that “[t]he facility must meet or \nexceed a minimum of 3.48 hours per resident day (‘HPRD’) for total nurse staffing,” which \nmust include a “minimum of 0.55 [HPRD] for registered nurses,” and a “minimum of 2.45 \n[HPRD] for nurse aides.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40996. \n108.  Before publication of the Final Rule, federal regulations mirrored Congress’s \nqualitative statutory requirements to keep nursing staff available 24-hours per day. See 42 \nC.F.R. § 483.30.  \n109.  Those regulations never specified a quantitative staffing requirement. Id.; Cf. 89 \nFed. Reg. 40876, 40996-97. But by departing from the flexibility of both the Medicare and \nMedicaid statutes, the Final Rule now requires national compliance from LTC facilities \n“regardless of the individual facility’s resident case-mix.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877.  \n28 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 28 of 66\n\n110.  Regarding the statutory waivers, the Final Rule permits Medicare participants to \nqualify for a statutory waiver of the 24/7 RN requirement, but not the HPRD requirements. Id. \nat 40997-98.  \n111.  The Final Rule also permits Medicaid participants to qualify for the statutory \nwaiver concerning the new 24/7 RN requirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement, but not for \nthe 3.48 total nurse HPRD nor 2.45 NA HPRD requirements. Id. at 40997.  \n112.  The Final Rule proposes a “hardship exemption,” ostensibly allowing partial \nrelief from the 24/7 requirement and minimum HPRD requirements. Id. at 40998. However, \nthis exemption is riddled with stringent criteria that make it virtually unattainable for most \nfacilities to achieve.  \n113.  To qualify for a “hardship exemption,” the facility must establish that it meets all \nfour regulatory requirements: (1) proving a significant local shortage of health care staff; (2) \ndemonstrating unsuccessful recruitment efforts despite offering competitive wages; (3) \ndocumenting financial expenditures on staffing relative to revenue; and (4) qualified facilities \nmust publicly disclose their exemption status. Id. at 40998.  \n114.  This façade of an exemption is not only limited in scope, but explicitly departs \nfrom the statutory waiver criteria already laid out by Congress. Even if granted on the case-\nby-case determination, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 40886, the exemption only provides an 8-hour \nreprieve from the 24/7 RN requirement, leaving facilities with the requirement to staff for a \nminimum of 16 hours per day, 7 days per week. Id. at 40998. \n115.  Even the narrow allowance of a “hardship exemption” can still be denied if a \nfacility is designated as a “Special Focus Facility,” or those with recent staffing-related \n29 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 29 of 66\n\ncitations. Id. Ultimately, LTC facilities currently struggling with staffing recruitment or \nretention will be incapable of qualifying for even a “hardship exemption.”  \nD. CMS Fails to Explain the Final Rule \n116.  In the Final Rule, CMS fails to explain why it implemented the 24/7 requirement \nand departed from the statutory requirements of both the Medicare and Medicaid Acts that \nonly require onsite RN services for only 8 hours per day, 7 days a week (hereinafter “8/7 \nrequirement”). \n117.  Nowhere in the Abt Study does it suggest that LTC facilities across the country \nshould require an on-site RN 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  \n118.  CMS fails to explain how it determined its 3.48, 0.55, or 2.45 HPRD \nrequirements. It claims that the 3.48, 0.55, and 2.45 HPRD levels “were developed using \ncase-mix adjusted data sources.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877.  \n119.  CMS claims that the 0.55 and 2.45 levels, but not the 3.48 level, were discussed \nduring the notice of proposed rulemaking. See 88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (Sept. 6, 2023); 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40891. \n120.  In the notice of proposed rulemaking, CMS indicated that based on findings from \nthe Abt Study, additional data sources, “two listening sessions,” and literature reviews, they \nproposed minimum staffing levels of 0.55 HPRD for RNs and 2.45 HPRD for NAs. 88 Fed. \nReg. at 61369.  \n121.  However, the Abt Study does not substantiate these specific levels. Moreover, a \n“review of existing literature” does not provide a valid evidentiary basis for establishing these \nrequirements.  \n30 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 30 of 66\n\n122.  CMS also fails to establish how other data assessments support the published \nstaffing levels.  \n123.  CMS provides no rationale for the 3.48 HPRD requirement in either the notice of \nproposed rulemaking or the Final Rule, aside from vaguely stating it was developed using \n“case-mix adjusted data sources.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877. This explanation departs from those \nused to establish other staffing levels in the notice of proposed rulemaking.  \n124.  Moreover, CMS’s minimum staffing ratios require LTC facilities to ignore the \nvariability in resident acuity and needs across different facilities. Some facilities with higher \nacuity residents may need increased staffing, while others with lower acuity residents may not \nrequire an RN present 24/7. CMS fails to explain why requiring facilities with lower acuity \nresidents to maintain higher staffing than needed is necessary for increasing quality of care.  \n125.  CMS’s rationale for the Final Rule is premised on truncated data that does not \naccurately capture the staffing realities in nursing homes. The Final Rule requires the use of \nPayroll Based Journaling (“PBJ”) data to monitor and enforce the HPRD and 24/7 \nrequirements. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40882-83.  \n126.  However, PBJ data fails to accurately account for the specific periods when LTC \nstaff are working and need to comply with the Final Rule. For instance, if an LTC facility \nemploys three RN’s who each work 8-hour dayshifts but no overnight shifts, it would appear \non paper that they meet the 24/7 requirement. But in reality, they are not. CMS thus fails to \nexplain how PBJ data is an accurate metric of tracking compliance.  \n127.  CMS fails to account for the ongoing shortage of nursing staff across the \ncountry—one that will surely be exacerbated by CMS’s mandate that will make compliance \nvirtually impossible in rural areas.  \n31 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 31 of 66\n\n128.  Instead of addressing the reality of the nationwide workforce shortage, CMS \nwould rather throw $75 million to help “increase the [LTC] workforce” that it “expects” will \nbe used for “tuition reimbursement.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40885-86. This $75 million is only a \nminiscule fraction of what is needed to comply or alleviate many of the affected LTC \nfacilities. Moreover, $75 million does not address the foundational problem.  \n129.  Ultimately, CMS’s explanation for the determination of these levels lacks \ntransparency and does not adequately explain how such arbitrary figures and standards were \ndetermined.   \nHARM TO THE PLAINTIFFS \nA.  Financial Burden \n130. The Final Rule imposes a monumental financial burden on LTC facilities, with \ncosts (conservatively) projected to exceed $5 billion per year after the Final Rule is fully \nimplemented. 89 Fed. Red. at 40970, tbl. 22; see id. at 40949. Outside studies point that \nnumber even higher—upwards of $7 billion per year by some estimates. Id. at 40950.  \n131.  All of Plaintiff States’ LTC facilities that receive Medicare and Medicaid will \nincur financial costs with the implementation of this Final Rule.  \n132.  LTC facilities in Kansas are a prime example of how the Final Rule creates a \ndaunting financial burden.  \n133.  The total cost for Kansas nursing facilities to comply with the Final Rule’s \nminimum staffing requirement—in the first year alone—ranges between $64 million and \n$92.7 million, with an average cost of $211,905 per facility.  \n134.  In Indiana, the Indiana Health Coverage Program and Indiana PathWays for \nAging provide coverage for long-term care services provided to eligible members with an \n32 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 32 of 66\n\napplicable level-of-care determination. CMS estimates that complying with the 24/7 RN \nRequirement will cost over $10.9 million annually in Indiana. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40962, tbl. 18. \nStatewide, CMS estimates that complying with this rule will cost Indiana long-term care \nfacilities $151.2 million. Id. at 40984, tbl. 28.  Much of this cost will be passed on to health \nplans, like Indiana Health Coverage Program and Indiana PathWays for Aging. So Indiana \nwill face increased costs to cover long-term care services. \n135.  Plaintiff LeadingAge Kansas represents a significant number of small, rural, and \nstand-alone nursing homes who will be unable to absorb the incessant compliance costs.  \n136.  LTC facilities operated by LeadingAge Kansas have historically relied on \nunderfunded Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement while serving senior citizens in their \ncommunities who can already ill afford escalating costs of healthcare.  \n137.  The estimated financial burden caused by the Final Rule will also include costs \nfor both employing new staff and the use of contracted nursing agency workers—which is \nsignificantly more expensive.  \n138.  For example, the average contracted RN rate is estimated at $72 per hour, while \nthe average W2 RN employee rate is around $40 per hour. The averaged contracted NA rate is \n$38 per hour, while the average W2 NA employee rate is around $19 per hour.  \n139.  For LeadingAge South Carolina, each LTC facility is estimated to have to pay \n$550,818 in compliance costs, which will potentially close most facilities.  \n140.  Wesley Commons, one of LeadingAge South Carolina’s LTC facilities, had to \nhire two additional RNs to comply with the Final Rule—incurring costs of $14,650, excluding \nnight and weekend shifts.  \n33 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 33 of 66\n\n141.  Additionally, for compliance with the Final Rule, it reinstated two full-time \nnursing assistants to meet the HPRD requirement—adding an additional $66,560 per year.  \n142.  These changes were necessary to comply with the Final Rule, despite previously \nmeeting both state and federal requirements. Moreover, to retain and recruit more staff due to \nthe new requirements, Wesley Commons increased pay, costing an additional $164,428 per \nyear.  \n143.  Facilities in rural areas that are operated by LeadingAge South Carolina will \nstruggle to compete with urban LTC facilities.  \n144.  For example, South Carolina Baptist Ministries of Aging paid over $1.25 million \nin 2022 to staffing agencies. In 2024 alone, and in order to come into compliance with the \nFinal Rule, it paid an additional $500,000 to staffing agencies ahead of time to come into \ncompliance.  \n145.  Another LTC operated by LeadingAge South Carolina—The Woodlands at \nFurman—had to raise its pay rates by over 20% in the past year.  \n146.  It is now forced to compete with private hospital systems that are continuously \nraising their RN and NA pay rates. Thus, the Final Rule’s staffing mandate has had the \ndownstream effect of creating a market where LTC facilities will have to limit their offerings \nor even shut their doors to elderly patients who need care.  \n147.  The financial strain, along with inadequate Medicaid reimbursement rates, \nthreatens many LTC facilities with closure, especially in rural communities with thin \noperating margins.  \n34 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 34 of 66\n\n148.  CMS has allocated only $75 million for nursing program tuition \nreimbursement—far less than what is needed. The Final Rule’s cost burden will affect \nproviders, private facilities, and Plaintiff States’ taxpayers.  \n149.  For example, 60 percent of nursing home residents in Kansas are on Medicaid. \nSince the COVID-19 Pandemic, Kansas lost 1,273 nursing home beds and 47 facilities closed \nor reduced services. Thus, the Final Rule will place a crippled LTC industry in dire straits.  \nB.  Administrative Burdens  \ni. Staffing Issues  \n150.  Not only is the Final Rule costly, but compliance will impact an overwhelming \nmajority of LTC facilities across the country. Indeed, even by CMS’s own estimate, more than \n79 percent of LTC facilities in the United States will have to find additional staff just to \ncomply with the new minimum-staffing requirements. 89 Fed. Reg.at 40877. This “exceed[s] \nthe existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all states.” Id.  \n151.  By CMS’s estimates, LTC facilities across the country will have to hire almost \n15,906 additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN requirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement. 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40958, 40977-80.  \n152.  Additionally, LTC facilities will have to hire 77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 NA \nHPRD requirement and the 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirement. Id. Hiring 90,000 new staff to \nfall in compliance with the Final Rule is practically impossible when LTC facilities are \nalready experiencing staffing shortages, recruitment issues, and employment retention.  \n153.  Kansas is a prime example of how the Final Rule’s adverse effects will \nirreparably harm Plaintiffs. According to CMS data, the state of Kansas will need an \n35 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 35 of 66\n\nadditional 230 RNs to comply with both the 24/7 Requirement and 0.55 RN HPRD \nrequirement for LTC facilities. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40059, 40077-79.  \n154.  CMS has already indicated that 109 LTC facilities are out of compliance with the \n24/7 RN requirement. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40062. Furthermore, Kansas will have to hire an \nadditional 523 NAs to comply with the Final Rule’s HPRD ratios. See id. at 40077-79.  \n155.  Nearly 85,000 Kansans live in areas with only one LTC facility within a 30-\nminute drive, and the closure of such facilities would significantly increase travel time, \ncreating a lack of access to care and essential services.  \n156.  Additionally, with the aging population in Kansas projected to grow by 208,000 \nby 2036, the capacity to provide adequate care will be severely strained if more facilities are \nforced to reduce capacity or close entirely.  \n157.  LTC facilities in Kentucky, according to the CMS data, will need to hire an \nadditional 185 RNs and to comply with both the 24/7 requirement and the 0.55 RN HPRD \nrequirement. See 89 Fed. Reg. 40965, 40977-80. \n158.  Furthermore, CMS estimates that Kentucky facilities will need to hire an \nadditional 1336 NA staff just to comply with the Final Rule’s HPRD ratios. See id. at 40977-\n80.  \n159.  CMS data estimates that 211 LTC facilities in Kentucky do not currently meet the \nFinal Rule’s staffing requirements.  \n160.  The Kentucky Association of Health Care Facilities, which represents skilled \nnursing facilities and personal care homes in Kentucky, estimates that only 6% of nursing \nhomes currently have sufficient nursing staff to comply with all the Final Rule’s requirements. \nYet, a workforce survey report by the Kentucky Hospital Association predicted a worsening \n36 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 36 of 66\n\nshortage of nursing staff available in Kentucky for LTCs to hire. See Morgan Watkins, New \nstudies show scope of Kentucky’s health care worker shortage, as a coalition promotes \nsolutions, available at https://perma.cc/XLT5-TMR9.  \n161.  Most of Montana consists of health professional shortage areas (HPSAs). Many \nof these LTC facilities are located in small towns or remote areas of Montana and likely have \ndifficulty hiring RNs or contracting for visiting nursing staff to meet the minimum staffing \nrequirements in the Final Rule.  \n162.  LTC facilities in South Carolina, according to CMS data, will need to hire an \nadditional 159 RNs to comply with both the 24/7 requirement and the 0.55 RN HPRD \nrequirement. See 89 Fed. Reg. 40958, 40978-80.  \n163.  Furthermore, South Carolina facilities will need to hire an additional 1,045 NA \nstaff just to comply with the Final Rule’s HPRD ratios. See id. at 40978-80. However, these \nnumbers are low.  \n164.  Based on LeadingAge South Carolina’s data, facilities in South Carolina will \nneed to hire 411 additional RNs and over 1170 NAs to meet the minimum staffing ratio \nprovision in the Final Rule.  \n165.  South Carolina is also projected to have the 4th largest nurse shortage by 2030. \nThe additional hiring necessitated by the Final Rule will thus make compliance virtually \nimpossible for LTC facilities.  \n166.  According to the South Carolina Workforce Publication on Nursing, 53% of RNs \nwork in hospital settings, whereas only 4.4% of RNs work in LTC settings.  \n167. Virginia’s HPRD requirement, which goes into effect on July 1, 2025, is more \nthan ten percent less than the Final Rule’s requirement. Senate Bill No. 1339, 2023 Gen \n37 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 37 of 66\n\nAssemb., Reg. Sess. (Va.), https://tinyurl.com/c3f58meh (to be codified at Va. Code § 32.1-\n127(B)(32)) (requiring nursing homes “to provide at least 3.08 hours of case mix-adjusted \ntotal nursing staffing hours per resident per day on average”). \n168.  Accordingly, any kind of required increase in staffing will have to account for (1) \nthe national shortage in the healthcare labor force, and (2) the detraction of nurses from \nhospital settings. Ultimately, detrimental negative externalities cascade from the Final Rule \nand jeopardize the health care system, state agencies, and state hospitals. \nii.   Enhanced Facility Assessment (“EFA”) \n169.  The Final Rule’s EFA implemented on August 8, 2024, requires providers to \nconduct a comprehensive evaluation of their facility, residents, staff, and resident families to \ndetermine staffing and other needs. 89 Fed. Reg. 40881, 40906.  \n170.  Specifically, the Final Rule mandates LTC facilities to ensure the “active \ninvolvement” of direct care staff and their representatives, and to “solicit and consider input” \nfrom residents, their representatives, and family members. Id. at 40908. LeadingAge Kansas \nhas requested guidance from the state survey agency contracted by CMS to carry out \nhealthcare surveys of nursing home providers in Kansas on this provision but did not receive \nadequate guidance.  \n171.  The Final Rule requires facilities to “review and update” the EFA at least \nannually, without clear guidance on when updates are “necessary”—thus, leading to potential \ncivil penalties. Id. at 40999.  \n172.  LTC facilities must also create “contingency planning,” despite already having \nemergency plans in place. Id. at 41000. Overall, the EFA imposes significant administrative \nburdens and vague requirements that could result in fiscal penalties.  \n38 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 38 of 66\n\n173.  Furthermore, staff hours and costs for the EFA vary facility-to-facility. For \nLeadingAge Kansas members like Wesley Towers and the Dooley Center, the initial EFA \nranged from 16 hours to 89 hours.  \n174.  The estimated cost for each update to comply with the assessment ranges from \n$400 to $600. The Final Rule’s vague language requiring continual updates means that costs \ncan quickly escalate.  \n175.  Most importantly, the significant amount of time needed for the EFA detracts \nfrom the essential administration and direct resident care necessary for quality and safety. The \nEFA is a significant burden on staff because it diverts time away from direct resident care to \nmaintain overburdensome compliance updates.  \n176.  CMS estimates the cost at $4,955 per facility, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 40939, but that \nnumber is woefully low. The Final Rule requires EFAs conducted on all LTC facilities without \nconsidering the acuity and needs of the residents to determine staffing levels or evaluate \nunique circumstances. These factors, coupled with the lack of clear guidance and the risk of \ncivil penalties, significantly contribute to the administrative burden imposed by the Final \nRule.   \nC.  Harm to Plaintiff States \n177.  Many Plaintiff States have their own state-run nursing homes. \n178.  For example, Arkansas has a state-operated 310-bed psychiatric nursing home, \nthe Arkansas Health Center, which would be required to comply with these new minimum \nstaffing quotas. See Ark. Code Ann. § 25-10-401. \n39 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 39 of 66\n\n179.  Idaho has at least five state-run nursing homes, all which receive Medicaid \npayments.  Four of the nursing homes are run by the Idaho Division of Veterans Services, and \none is run by the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare. \n180.  Montana operates several LTC facilities that receive CMS fund and that would be \nsubject to CMS regulations. \n181.  West Virginia’s Department of Health Facilities operates four nursing homes: \nHopemont Hospital, John Manchin, Sr. Health Care Center, Lakin Hospital, and Welch \nCommunity Hospital.  See West Virginia Department of Health Facilities, \nhttps://tinyurl.com/3ykbt2tw (last visited Oct. 4, 2024).   Altogether, West Virginia’s state-run \nnursing homes have 312 beds.  See id. \n182.  Those States facilities would incur the same harm as any LTC as noted above. \n183.  Non-State-run nursing homes would incur the same harm as any LTC as noted \nabove.  The resulting burdens may result in nursing homes closing, causing harm to state \ncitizens.  \n184.  Alaska is largely a frontier and rural state, with uniquely difficult workforce \nshortage challenges.  According to a recent report, “hospital-based registered nurses had a \nvacancy rate of 21%, and it took an average of 118 days to fill a vacant position. Alaska is \ncompeting with the rest of the country for a limited number of healthcare workers. Projections \nindicate Alaska is expected to have the most significant shortages moving forward of any \nstate. In 2022, Alaska programs graduated fewer than 900 healthcare workers in key positions, \nwhile the number of healthcare workers needed for those positions was 3,232. Travel nurses \ncan be used to meet short-term staffing needs; however, this solution comes at a higher cost. \nIn 2023, traveling registered nurses in Alaska earned 57% more pay on average than non-\n40 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 40 of 66\n\ntraveling RNs.” Alaska Hospital & Healthcare Association, 2023 Alaska Healthcare \nWorkforce Analysis, 1 (Dec. 2023), \nhttps://www.alaskahha.org/_files/ugd/ab2522_bde54b435a474ca48101c58d9239da21.pdf.   \n185.  The Final Rule’s 24/7 RN requirement will exacerbate the nursing workforce \nshortage. \n186.  The Final Rule’s requirements disincentivize nursing homes from accepting \nMedicaid and Medicare, placing vulnerable Alaskans at risk of losing access to needed care. \n187.  The State of Alaska provides licensing oversight for LTCs.  The Final Rule would \nimpose additional financial costs and resource burdens on state agencies monitoring \ncompliance and reviewing waivers under section 483.35(f). \n188.  The Final Rule also requires states, through their Medicaid agencies, to provide \n“institutional payment transparency reporting” which means they must provide to the \nDefendants a yearly report on the percentage of Medicaid payments that are spent on direct \ncompensation services versus administrative overhead costs.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40,995. The \nFinal Rule also requires that this information be posted on state websites.  89 Fed. Reg. \n40,990. \n189.  Although this requirement does not take effect until four years after the Final \nRule is published, it will impose costs on States well before that.  The Final Rule \nacknowledges as much by estimating the cost to the States in year one to be $183,851.  Id.     \n \n \n \n \n41 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 41 of 66\n\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \n(APA – Lack of Statutory Authority) \n190.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n191.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or \nlimitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n192.  CMS, like all administrative agencies, is a “creature[] of statute,” and \naccordingly “possess[es] only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n of \nIndep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022); see also, e.g., La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n \nv. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (“[A]n agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and \nuntil Congress confers power upon it.”).  \n193.  The Final Rule exceeds CMS’s statutory authority in violation of the APA, 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C) in multiple ways. \nA.   The 24/7 RN Requirement \n194.  Congress has already established the minimum amount of RN staffing necessary \nto participate in Medicaid or Medicare: LTC facilities “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” 42 U.S.C. § \n1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n195.  The Final Rule ignores this by stating an LTC “must have a registered nurse (RN) \nonsite 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997.  \n42 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 42 of 66\n\n196.  CMS acknowledges that the statutory provisions establishing the 8/7 requirement \nfor RN staffing do not authorize it to adopt the 24/7 RN requirement. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40891.  \n197.  CMS nevertheless asserts that “various provisions” elsewhere in §§ 1395i-3 and \n1396r contain “separate authority” for this novel requirement, id. at 40879, 40890-91, \npointing to provisions stating that: (1) The Secretary may impose “such other requirements \nrelating to the health and safety of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the \nSecretary may find necessary,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4)(B), accord 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-\n3(d)(4)(B); (2) An LTC facility “must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the \nhighest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident in \naccordance with a written plan of care,” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(2), accord 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-\n3(b)(2); and (3) An LTC facility “must care for its residents in such a manner and in such an \nenvironment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each \nresident.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(1)(A); accord 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(1)(A). \n198.  The only provision that arguably allows authority for CMS to engage in \nrulemaking is 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4)(B), accord 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), that requires \nLTCs to “meet such other requirements relating to the health, safety, and well-being of \nresidents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.” \n(emphasis added). \n199.  That statutory provision is in a broader subsection that refers to “[r]equirements \nrelating to administration and other matters.” See 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d), accord 42 U.S.C. § \n1395i-3(d) (emphasis added).   \n43 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 43 of 66\n\n200.  Drilling down further the subsection right above this rulemaking authority CMS \nlatches onto is entitled “Miscellaneous.”  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4), accord 42 U.S.C. § \n1395i-3(d)(4). \n201.  Finally, the specific statutory subsection relied on for authority is entitled “other” \nand refers to “other requirements relating to the health and safety…as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(d)(4)(B), accord 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(d)(4)(B). \n202.  The best reading of the only statutory authority CMS relies on for rulemaking is \nthat it is related to administrivia for the health and safety of LTC patients that the rest of the \nMedicare and Medicaid statute does not already cover. \n203.  Congress covered the mandatory hours for nurse staffing for LTCs in a separate \nstatutory provision and as such, there is no universe where they gave authority to CMS to alter \nthat through rulemaking in a “miscellaneous” statutory provision. \n204.  None of the other general provisions CMS relies on allows it to impose a 24/7 \nstatutory requirement either when a more specific statute only requires 8/7 nursing services. \nThat’s because “[g]eneral language” in one part of a statute “will not be held to apply to a \nmatter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.” E.g., RadLAX Gateway \nHotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645-46 (2012) (quoting D. Ginsberg & Sons, \nInc. v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204, 208 (1932)).  \n205.  Yet that is what the Final Rule does. Even CMS recognizes that the Final Rule \n“revises” the statutory 8/7 RN requirement codified at 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and \n1396r(b)(4)(C)(i) by replacing it with CMS’s 24/7 RN requirement. See 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40898.  \n44 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 44 of 66\n\n206.  Congress did not leave that decision open for CMS to make.  CMS lacks \nstatutory authority to impose the 24/7 RN requirement, and the Final Rule must be set aside. \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \nB.   The HPRD Requirements \n207.  The same is true for the Final Rule’s HPRD requirements. Congress carefully \nconsidered whether to enact quantitative staff-to-patient ratios for LTC facilities, and it chose \nnot to do so.  \n208.  Instead, Congress opted for a qualitative standard, leaving quantitative staff-to-\npatient ratios to the states: LTC facilities must provide nursing services “sufficient to meet the \nnursing needs of its residents.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n209.  The Final Rule unlawfully substitutes CMS’s current policy views for Congress’ \nconsidered judgment. Instead of accommodating the wide variation of resident needs in \ndifferent states, the Final Rule inflexibly mandates that each facility in each state meet an \narbitrary numerical staffing threshold: “[a] minimum of 3.48 hours per resident day for total \nnurse staffing[,] including but not limited to—(i) [a] minimum of 0.55 hours per resident day \nfor registered nurses; and (ii) [a] minimum of 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40996.  \n210.  Once again, CMS does not rely on § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C) or § 1396r(b)(4)(C) as \nauthority for these new requirements.  \n211.  And once again, CMS invokes the Secretary’s “miscellaneous” authority to make \n“other” rules that Congress did not already cover for the health and safety of residents, as well \nas provisions requiring LTC facilities to “provide services to attain or maintain the highest \npracticable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident,” and “promote \n45 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 45 of 66\n\nmaintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each resident.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40879, \n40890-91; see 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), (d)(4)(B); 1396r(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), \n(d)(4)(B).  \n212.  But none of those general provisions authorizes CMS to impose nationwide \nHPRD requirements for RNs, NAs, and total nursing staff. CMS’s general authority over \nMedicare and Medicaid does not permit it to modify “matter[s] specifically dealt with in \nanother part of the same enactment.” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, 566 U.S. at 646; see also 42 \nU.S.C. § 1302(a) (the Secretary may not promulgate regulations that are “inconsistent with” \nstatutory requirements).  \n213.  Congress carefully considered what staffing levels to require from LTC facilities, \nand it decided to require that each facility maintain staffing levels “sufficient to meet the \nnursing needs of its residents.” 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(4)(C), 1395i-3(b)(4)(C).  \n214.  CMS cannot utilize general authority to supersede Congress’ judgment with its \nown arbitrary numerical requirements. Simply put, CMS does not have the authority to \noverride Congress’ judgment. \nC.   Major Questions Doctrine \n215.  The Final Rule also flunks the Major Questions Doctrine. The history of \nCongress’ actions in this area, the “breadth of the authority” CMS now asserts, and “the \neconomic and political significance” of that asserted authority confirm that CMS does not \nhave the power to impose these new staffing mandates. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n721 (2022). \n216.  CMS proposes to revamp the entire nursing home industry to the tune of at least \n$43 billion dollars in compliance costs.  The actual cost is likely much higher.  The Supreme \n46 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 46 of 66\n\nCourt has held that $50 billion qualifies as a Rule of vast economic significance.  Alabama \nAssociation of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services, 594 U.S. 758, 764 \n(2021).   \n217.  Beyond the costs, the breath of authority CMS now asserts is monumental.  The \nFinal Rule would fundamentally alter the landscape of the nursing home industry in a manner \nthat impacts 97% of all nursing homes and will put many of them out of business.  \nFurthermore, it would exceed the minimum staffing requirements for nursing homes in \n“nearly all states.” 89 Fed. Reg. 40,877. \n218.  Finally, because Congress only required 8/7 staffing requirements and allowed \nflexibility for LTCs based on the needs of their facilities, states have moved to fill that void.  \nThe Final Rule acknowledges that 38 states and the District of Columbia have adopted their \nown staffing standards that vary between them.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40,881. \n219.  “When an agency claims the power to regulate vast swaths of American life, it \nnot only risks intruding on Congress's power, it also risks intruding on powers reserved to the \nStates.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 744. (Gorsuch, J. concurring). CMS has “intruded” on \npowers traditionally reserved to the States by forcing this staffing rule on them. \n220.  When the major questions doctrine is triggered, as it is in this case, “clear \nauthorization” and not some “vague statutory grant” is required in order for a court to find it \nlawful. Id. at 732.   \n221.  CMS fails this test because they rely exclusively on a vague statutory grant and \ndo not come close to clear authorization as the Final Rule conflicts with a separate \nCongressional statute. \n222.  The Final Rule flunks the Major Questions Doctrine and should be set aside.   \n47 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 47 of 66\n\nD.  Constitutional Doubt \n223.  If Congress truly gave CMS the authority to implement a regulation that costs at \nleast $43 billion to comply with and overrides another one of its provisions, then it supplies \nno intelligible principle to guide how that power should be exercised.\\ \n224.  If CMS’ interpretation was accepted as the one Congress intended it would \npresent serious nondelegation concerns.  See Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 607, n.14 (6th \nCir. 2022). (“If the government's interpretation were correct—that the President can do \nessentially whatever he wants so long as he determines it necessary to make federal \ncontractors more ‘economical and efficient’—then that certainly would present non-\ndelegation concerns.”) \n225.  The constitutional-doubt canon requires this Court to interpret the Rule to avoid \nthese severe constitutional problems. \n226.  As the Supreme Court has explained, its “application of the nondelegation \ndoctrine principally has been limited to the interpretation of statutory texts, and, more \nparticularly, to giving narrow constructions to statutory delegations that might otherwise be \nthought to be unconstitutional.” Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 373, n.7 (198 \n227.  The Supreme Court thus reads statutes with this principle in mind, see, e.g., \nGundy v. United States, 139 S.Ct. 2116 (2019), and this Court should do the same. \nCOUNT TWO \n(APA – Contrary to Law) \n228.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein. \n48 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 48 of 66\n\n229.  The Final Rule is not in accordance with law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A).  Even if CMS had some authority to set staffing requirements through vague \nstatutory provisions, it could not utilize that limited authority to contradict what Congress had \nalready put into place. \n230.  “Agencies may play the sorcerer’s apprentice but not the sorcerer himself.”  \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 291 (2001).  The Final Rule is a crude attempt by CMS \nto play sorcerer. \nA.   The 24/7 RN Requirement \n231.  Congress has already established the minimum amount of RN staffing necessary \nto participate in Medicaid or Medicare: LTC facilities “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” 42 U.S.C. \n§1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). The Final Rule rewrites this statutory \nrequirement in two ways.  \n232.  First, it triples the hours of mandatory RN staffing. It does this by replacing the \n8/7 RN requirement enacted by Congress with a mandate that all LTC facilities “must have a \nregistered nurse (RN) onsite 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997.  \n233.  As noted above, Congress only requires 24-hour nursing staff sufficient to meet \nthe needs of nursing home patients.  42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I) \n234.  This indicates that there are at least some situations where Congress did not \nexpect nursing homes to require 24-hour nursing staff without seeking a waiver. \n235.  By requiring 24-hour nurse staffing for all nursing homes, CMS has directly \ncontradicted the statute it claims to interpret.  This they cannot do. \n49 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 49 of 66\n\n236.  Second, the Final Rule replaces the statutorily set scope of services to be \nrendered by RNs. It does so by changing the requirement to “use the services of” an RN, \nincluding in administrative or supervisory roles, with a new requirement to have an RN \n“available to provide direct resident care.” Id. \n237.  The Final Rule effectively rewrites this statutory provision to fit the views of \nCMS.  This is an attempt to play sorcerer which the agency cannot do. \nB.  The HPRD Requirements \n238.  Under existing law, each LTC facility must provide nursing services “sufficient to \nmeet the nursing needs of its residents.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord § 1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i). The States are then free to set their own HPRD requirements. As CMS \nacknowledges, “38 States and the District of Columbia have minimum nursing staffing \nstandards” for nursing homes. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40880. \n239.  But instead of accommodating the wide variation of resident needs in different \nstates, the Final Rule inflexibly mandates that each LTC facility nationwide must meet an \narbitrary numerical staffing threshold: “[a] minimum of 3.48 hours per resident day for total \nnurse staffing[,] including but not limited to—(i) [a] minimum of 0.55 hours per resident day \nfor registered nurses; and (ii) [a] minimum of 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40996.  \n240.  Because the Final Rule’s nationwide one-size-fits-all HPRD requirements \ncontradicts Congress’s intended flexibility for LTC facility nursing services, the Final Rule is \nnot in accordance with law and must be set aside. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n \n \n50 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 50 of 66\n\nCOUNT THREE \n(APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n241.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding allegations as \nthough fully set forth herein.  \n242.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n243.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(A). \n244.  The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious standard requires agency action to be \n“reasonable and reasonably explained.” E.g., Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 226 (5th \nCir. 2022) (quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)). This \nstandard “is not toothless”; instead, “it has serious bite.” Id.  \n245.  The court “must set aside any action premised on reasoning that fails to account \nfor relevant factors or evinces a clear error of judgment.” Id. Failing to account for costs is \nfailure to consider an important part of the problem. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 752-53 \n(2015). (“Agencies have long treated cost as a centrally relevant factor when deciding \nwhether to regulate. Consideration of cost reflects the understanding that reasonable \nregulation ordinarily requires paying attention to the advantages and the disadvantages of \nagency decisions.”) \n246.  And when an agency changes a longstanding policy, it must “show that there are \ngood reasons for the new policy” and “be cognizant that longstanding policies may have \n‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be taken into account.’” Encino Motorcars, \n51 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 51 of 66\n\nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 (2016) (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., \n556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).  \n247.  By promulgating the Final Rule, CMS violated these requirements. \nA.   Sharp Departure from Past Practice \n248.  Over the past half century, CMS and its predecessors have consistently declined \nto deviate from the plain text of the Social Security Act by requiring nursing homes to provide \n“a specific ratio of nursing staff to patients.” 39 Fed. Reg. at 2239 (In 1974, the Social \nSecurity Administration declined to adopt such a nationwide ratio requirement); see also e.g., \n45 Fed. Reg. at 47371 (In 1980, HHS expressly declined to propose “any nursing staff ratios \nor minimum number of nursing hours per patient per day.”). \n249.  In 1986, an HHS-commissioned study concluded that “prescribing simple \nstaffing ratios clearly is inappropriate.”3 \n250.  In 2002, the Secretary of HHS informed Congress that, after studying the issue \nfor several years, it was not recommending the imposition of minimum-staffing ratios on LTC \nfacilities.4 \n251.  Most recently, in 2016, CMS again rejected requests to adopt minimum-staffing \nrules, reiterating that it is not reasonable to adopt “a ‘one size fits all’ approach” toward LTC \nfacilities. 81 Fed. Reg. at 68755; see id. at 68754-56, 68758. \n \n3 See Inst. of Med., Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes 102-03 (Mar. 1986), \nhttps://archive.ph/KFNCi. \n4 Letter from Tommy G. Thompson, Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., to J. Dennis Hastert, \nSpeaker of House of Representatives 1 (Mar. 19, 2002) (“Thompson Letter”), reprinted in Office \nof Asst. Sec’y for Planning & Evaluation, Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., State Experiences with \nMinimum Nursing Staff Ratios for Nursing Facilities: Findings from Case Studies of Eight States \napp. 1 (Nov. 2003), https://archive.ph/wip/KQWPt. \n52 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 52 of 66\n\n252.  With that longstanding position in view, CMS failed to provide a reasoned \nexplanation for departing from it, especially when the study they utilized to justify the \nmandates did not provide sufficient evidence for it.  This is arbitrary and capricious. \nB.   Failure to Consider Reliance Interests \n253.  In addition to failing to reasonably explain its sharp departure from prior practice, \nCMS also failed to consider reliance interests in its decision-making. \n254.  Longstanding policy has left decisions on staffing primarily up to the states.  And \nStates responded by crafting their own staffing requirements.  Both States and LTCs have \nrelied on this flexibility for decades. \n255.  State Medicaid rates for nursing home services vary from $170 per day to over \n$400 per day. AHCA Cmt.6. Some States have a relatively steady supply of RNs and NAs, \nwhile other States are facing a massive shortage. See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at 40957, 40976; 81 \nFed. Reg. at 6755 (noting “geographic disparity in supply” of nursing staff).  \n256.  Rather than “highlight[ing] the need for national minimum-staffing standards,” \nthe “widespread variability in existing minimum staffing standards” adopted by 38 States and \nthe District of Columbia underscores that “different local circumstances . . . make different \nstaffing levels appropriate (and higher levels impracticable) in different areas of the country.” \nCompare 89 Fed. Reg. at 40880, with AHCA Cmt.6.  \n257.  By imposing rigid nationwide requirements that “exceed the existing minimum \nstaffing requirements in nearly all States,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877, CMS not only ignored \nCongress but also state governments whose state-law minimum staffing requirements reflect \nlocal conditions. \n53 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 53 of 66\n\n258.  Arkansas sets a general HPRD monthly standard lower than the Final Rule and \ndoes not establish specific quotas for RNs and NAs.  See Ark. Code Ann. § 20-10-1402(a)(2) \n(requiring \"direct care services by direct care staff equivalent to at least three and thirty-six \nhundredths (3.36) Average Direct Care Hours Per Resident Day\"). \n259.  Kentucky does not set a numerical staffing requirement for nursing homes. \nRather, Kentucky adopts a flexible approach requiring “twenty-four (24) hour nursing \nservices with a sufficient number of nursing personnel on duty at all times to meet the total \nneeds of residents.” 902 Ky. Admin. Reg. 20:048, § 3(2)(a). Although Kentucky requires a \ncharge nurse to be always on duty, a licensed practical nurse may serve in that role if a \nregistered nurse is on call.  Id. at § 2(10)(l). \n260.  Missouri’s minimum staffing requirements for skilled nursing facilities and \nresidential care facilities are set by the Missouri Code of State Regulations. 19 C.S.R. § 20-\n85.042; id.§ 30-86.042 & .043. Skilled nursing facilities must have an RN on duty in the \nfacility for the day shift, and either an LPN or RN for both evening and night shifts. An RN \nalso must be on call any time only an LPN is on duty. And all residential care facilities must \nhave at least one employee for every forty residents. In addition, Missouri residential care \nfacilities must employ a licensed nurse for eight hours per week per thirty residents to monitor \neach resident’s condition and medication.  \n261.  North Dakota has, for decades, set a minimum staffing requirement obligating \nfacilities to have an RN on duty for eight hours per day.  See N.D. Admin. Code § 33-07-03.2-\n14 (effective July 1, 1996).  And as of the first quarter of 2023, only one of North Dakota’s 76 \nnursing facilities would comply with the Rule’s new HPRD standards. \n54 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 54 of 66\n\n262.  South Carolina requires each nursing home to have one RN on call, but not on \nsite, whenever residents are present in the facility. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-17.  \n263.  And South Carolina’s HPRD requirement for FY 2024-2025 is less than half of \nthat required by the Final Rule. S.C. Gen. Approp. Bill § 31.18 (requiring South Carolina \nnursing homes to provide “one and sixty-three hundredths (1.63) hours of direct care per \nresident per day from the non-licensed nursing staff” and requiring nursing homes to \n“maintain at least one licensed nurse per shift for each staff work area.”) \n(https://tinyurl.com/3kjw4mtv). \n264.  West Virginia requires each nursing home in the State to have an RN on duty in \nthe facility for at least eight consecutive hours, seven days a week.  W. Va. Code R. § 64-13-\n8.14.4.  If there is not an RN on duty, West Virginia law requires an RN to be on call.  Id. § \n64-13-8.14.5.  West Virginia also requires nursing homes to provide at least “2.25 hours of \nnursing personnel time per resident per day.”  Id. § 64-13-8.14.1.  \n265.  CMS concedes that its 24/7 RN requirement imposes a one-size-fits-all \nrequirement, 89 Fed. Reg. at 40908.  And CMS acknowledges that “more than 79 percent of \nnursing facilities nationwide” cannot meet the new requirements with their current staff, but \nits own findings belie the notion that anywhere close to 79 percent of U.S. nursing homes are \nfailing to meet “minimum baseline standards for safety and quality.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40887.  \n266.  Yet CMS’s own survey process indicates that “roughly 95 percent of facilities” \nare already “providing ‘sufficient nursing staff’” without the new requirements. AHCA \nCmt.25.  \n267.  CMS’s explanation for abandoning its decades-old rejection of one-size-fits-all \nstaffing requirements boils down to this: Some LTC facilities are chronically understaffed, \n55 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 55 of 66\n\nand “evidence demonstrates the benefits of increased nurse staffing in these facilities.” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40881; see id. at 40893-94.   \n268.  The general proposition that increased staffing in understaffed facilities can lead \nto better outcomes is not a reasonable consideration of the reliance interests of both states and \nLTCs who have had flexibility for decades.  Such a failure is arbitrary and capricious.  \nC.  Failure to Consider Important Aspects of the Problem \n269.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious for another reason as well:  It fails to \nconsider important aspects of the problems, and it does so in two ways. \n270.  First, it fails to consider the possibility that it is virtually impossible for LTCs to \ncomply with the Final Rule. \n271.  As detailed in various comments on the proposed rule, it will be nearly \nimpossible for many LTC facilities to implement CMS’s new minimum-staffing requirements \nbecause of the inadequate supply of RNs and NAs. See AHCA Cmt.1-2, 5, 11-13, 18; \nLeadingAge Cmt.1-2, 4; THCA Cmt.1-2.  \n272.  Even CMS acknowledges the new requirements “exceed the existing minimum \nstaffing requirements in nearly all States” and will require increased staffing “in more than 79 \npercent of nursing facilities nationwide.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877.  \n273.  And CMS estimates that LTC facilities will need to hire an additional 15,906 \nadditional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN requirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement (an \nincrease of about 11.8%), plus an additional 77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD \nrequirement and 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirement (an increase of about 17.2%). See id. at \n40958, 40977-80.  \n56 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 56 of 66\n\n274.  Those increases are unattainable at a time when many LTC facilities are already \nexperiencing extreme difficulty finding qualified RNs and NAs to fill vacant positions, and \nwhen staffing shortages are expected only to worsen. See, e.g., AHCA Cmt.5; LeadingAge \nCmt.1. Put simply, “staffing mandates do not create more caregivers, nor do they drive \ncaregivers to work in long term care.” AHCA Cmt.1. \n275.  The Final Rule also irrationally discounts the vital role of LPNs/LVNs, who hold \nnearly 230,000 jobs in LTC facilities across the country and undisputedly “provide important \nservices to [their] residents.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40881; see AHCA Cmt.6; LeadingAge Cmt.2.  \n276.  As commenters pointed out, the Final Rule creates an incentive for LTC facilities \n“to terminate LPN/LVNs and replace them with . . . [less qualified] nurse aides” in order to \nmeet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement.  \n277.  CMS recognized this problem in both the proposed rule and the Final Rule, but \nconcluded that “[a] total nurse staffing standard will guard[] against” it. 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40893; see 88 Fed. Reg. at 61366, 61369.  \n278.  But that’s wrong. For example, a facility that already provides high-quality care \nthrough average staffing of 0.55 RN HPRD, 1.25 LVN/LPN HPRD, and 1.7 NA HPRD would \nsatisfy the 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirement but would need an additional 0.75 NA HPRD \nto satisfy the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement.  \n279.  The Final Rule thus pressures LTC facilities to replace experienced LPNs/LVNs \nwith less-qualified new hires to meet CMS’s arbitrary quota of 2.45 NA HPRD. \n280.  The Final Rule does not deny that there are not nearly enough RNs and NAs \navailable to enable the 79 percent of LTC facilities that are not presently in compliance with \nthe agency’s new mandates.  \n57 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 57 of 66\n\n281.  CMS asserts that the Final Rule’s phase-in period will “allow all facilities the \ntime needed to prepare and comply with the new requirements specifically to recruit, retain, \nand hire nurse staff as needed.” 89 Fed. Reg. 40894.  \n282.  But delaying the deadline for compliance does nothing to fix the underlying \nproblems. Regardless of whether it goes into effect tomorrow or two or three years from now, \nthe Final Rule is a multi-billion-dollar unfunded mandate that many LTC facilities will have \nno realistic way to meet. And there is no reason to think that the shortage of RNs and NAs \nwill ease over the next two to three years.  \n283.  In fact, it is projected to become even worse, as “hundreds of thousands are \nexpected to retire or leave the health care profession entirely in the coming years.” AHCA \nCmt.5; see id. at 2 (“The phase-in provisions are frankly meaningless considering the growing \ncaregiver shortage.”); LeadingAge Cmt.7 (similar).  \n284.  CMS says that it “fully expect[s] that LTC facilities will be able to meet [the \nFinal Rule’s] requirements,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40894, but it fails to cite any evidence to support \nthis wishful thinking.  \n285.  Moreover, the staggered implementation timeframe risks “pit[ting] urban and \nrural areas against each other as staff are first recruited away from rural areas to fulfill the \nneeds of urban nursing homes, then 1-2 years later rural areas are scrapping to bring staff \nback.” LeadingAge Cmt.7. \n286.  Finally, CMS’s “hardship exemption” process is a wholly inadequate response to \nthe staffing shortage and economic constraints facing LTC facilities.  \n287.  For one thing, such exemptions are available only to facilities that have been \nsurveyed and cited for failure to meet the new staffing standards—and “facilities cannot \n58 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 58 of 66\n\nrequest” (or receive) “a survey specifically for the purpose of granting an exemption.” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40902.  \n288.  Thus, instead of being able to proactively explain why it should be entitled to an \nexemption, facilities that cannot meet CMS’s arbitrary requirements will face a perpetual risk \nof being sanctioned for non-compliance. See AHCA Cmt.6, 33-34; LeadingAge Cmt.6 \n(criticizing CMS’s approach as “unnecessarily punitive”).  \n289.  In all events, the waivers are “no solution for the ongoing nationwide shortage in \nnursing staff” or the lack of funds available to implement the new requirements. AHCA \nCmt.7.  \n290.  CMS repeatedly emphasizes that the hardship exemption is meant for “limited \ncircumstances,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40894, and that many facilities in areas of the country with \nsevere shortages of available RNs and NAs would not qualify for an exemption because there \nare so many “other requirements” that must be met “to obtain an exemption.” Id. at 40953. \n291.  Second, the Final Rule fails to reasonably consider the staggering costs, which \nunderscores its arbitrary and capricious nature.  \n292.  According to CMS, the Final Rule will cost over $5 billion per year to implement \nonce fully phased in, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 40949, 40970. Other estimates place the costs as \nhigh as $7 billion per year, see id. at 40950.  \n293.  The Final Rule does not provide any additional funding for Medicare or \nMedicaid, so CMS “assume[s] that LTC facilities . . . will bear the[se] costs.” Id. at 40949.  \n294.  And LTC facilities are in no position to take on this huge financial burden. AHCA \nCmt.5; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2; THCA Cmt.3. Almost 60 percent of LTC facilities already have \nnegative operating margins; more than 500 LTC facilities closed over the course of the \n59 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 59 of 66\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic; and the costs associated with these new staffing mandates would likely \nforce many more facilities to close. AHCA Cmt.5; see LeadingAge Cmt.1-2. \n295.  CMS’s imposition of this massive, unfunded staffing mandate, despite the \nongoing workforce crisis and economic realities, is neither “reasonable” nor “reasonably \nexplained.” Cf. Texas, 40 F.4th at 226.  \n296.  It instead simply touts a new initiative that seeks to encourage people to pursue \ncareers in nursing by “investing over $75 million in financial incentives such as tuition \nreimbursement.” 89 Fed. Reg. 40894.  \n297.  But this “one-time workforce effort” is “a drop in the bucket compared to the \nfunding that will be needed to train [the] additional nursing staff” necessary to meet the new \nmandates. AHCA Cmt. 23; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2. It “is not going to fix the workforce crisis,” \nand it does practically nothing to offset the $5 billion to $7 billion per year in costs that the \nFinal Rule imposes on LTC facilities. AHCA Cmt.23; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2. \n298.  Additionally, LTC facilities are experiencing financial harms now. The Final \nRule’s EFA, implemented on August 8, 2024, requires providers to conduct a comprehensive \nevaluation of their facility, residents, staff, and resident families to determine staffing and \nother needs.  \n299.  This assessment imposes a significant burden on LTC facilities. CMS estimates \nthe cost of the EFA to be around $4,955 per facility, but that number is likely low. \n300.  The Final Rule also requires each facility to “review and update that assessment, \nas necessary, and at least annually.” The facilities lack further guidance as to when such \nupdates are “necessary,” imposing a further burden of continuously updating a plan or being \nsubject to potential civil penalties.  \n60 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM   Document 1   Filed 10/08/24   Page 60 of 66\n\n301.  The EFA also requires facilities to create “contingency planning,” even though \nthe facilities already are required to have emergency plans for, among other things, staffing \nissues.  \n302.  In total, the EFA imposes hours upon hours of additional work and significant \nadministrative burdens on the facilities and subjects them to vague requirements that could \nresult in steep civil penalties. \n303.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious agency action and must be set aside. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n1.  Plaintiffs pray for the following relief from the Court: \n2.

INTRODUCTION \n  This  case  is  before  me  on  the  plaintiffs’1  motion  (Doc.  30)  for  preliminary \ninjunction.  The defendants2 filed a resistance (Doc. 72) and the plaintiffs filed a reply \n(Doc. 78).  On December 5, 2024, I heard oral arguments by teleconference.   \n \nII.  PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL HISTORY \n  On October 8, 2024, the plaintiffs filed a complaint (Doc. 1) alleging that the \nBiden-Harris  administration’s  Final  Rule  –  “Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs; \nMinimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care Facilities and Medicaid Institutional \n \n1 The plaintiffs include 20 states, 17 affiliates of LeadingAge (a trade association of non-profit \nnursing facilities) and two Kansas nursing home facilities.  I will refer to all of the plaintiffs \ncollectively as “the plaintiffs,” the state plaintiffs as “the States” and the non-state plaintiffs as \n“the Organizations.”    \n2 The named defendants are Xavier Becerra, in his official capacity as Secretary of the United \nStates Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Chiquita Brooks-Lasure, \nin her official capacity as Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.  I \nwill refer to all of the defendants collectively as “the Government.”   \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 1 of 21\n\nPayment Transparency Reporting” (Final Rule) – violates various provisions of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (APA).  89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024).  Specifically, \nthe plaintiffs argue that the Final Rule (1) lacks statutory authority, (2) is contrary to law \nand (3) is arbitrary and capricious.  Doc. 1 at 42-61.  The plaintiffs filed their motion for \na preliminary injunction on October 22, 2024.   \n \nA.   Medicaid and Medicare Statutes \nIn 1965, Congress established the Medicaid and Medicare programs by amending \nthe Social Security Act.  Pub. L. No. 89-97, 79 Stat. 286 (July 30, 1965).  Medicare \nprovides health insurance to “nearly 60 million aged or disabled Americans.”  Northport \nHealth Servs. of Ark., LLC v. U.S. Dep't of Health & Hum. Servs., 14 F.4th 856, 863 \n(8th Cir. 2021) (quoting Azar v. Allina Health Servs., 587 U.S. 566, 569 (2019)); see \nalso 42 U.S.C. § 1395 et seq.  Medicaid is a joint federal-state program in which the \nfederal government provides approximately $600 billion in financial assistance to states \nto offer healthcare coverage to low-income individuals.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1396 et seq.; \nsee also Northport, 14 F.4th at 863.  The Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) administers both programs through the Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services (CMS), a sub-agency of HHS.  See CENTERS FOR MEDICARE & \nMEDICAID SERVICES, CMS.gov (last visited Jan. 5, 2025). \n  Nursing homes that participate in Medicare and Medicaid must comply with \ncertain statutory requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 (Medicare); see 42 U.S.C. § \n1396r (Medicaid).  As these statutory requirements under Medicare and Medicaid are \nlargely the same, these nursing homes are often collectively known as “long-term care” \n(LTC) facilities.  In addition, LTC facilities must comply with CMS’s regulations, as \nthey are applicable to all LTC facilities that participate in Medicare and/or Medicaid.  \nSee 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.1-.95; see also Northport, 14 F.4th at 863.  \n  \n \n2 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 2 of 21\n\nB.   CMS Rulemaking Process and the Final Rule  \nOn February 22, 2022, the Biden-Harris administration announced its intent to \nimplement several reforms to “improve the safety and quality of nursing home care, hold \nnursing homes accountable for the care they provide, and make the quality of care and \nfacility ownership more transparent so that potential residents and their loved ones can \nmake informed decisions about care.”  FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving \nSafety and Quality of Care in the Nation’s NursingHomes, THE WHITE HOUSE (Feb. 28, \n2022), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-\nsheet-protecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-\nof-care-in-the-nations-nursing-homes/.  To this end, the administration directed CMS to \n“conduct a new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure \nsafe  and  quality  care  and  []  issue  proposed  rules  within  one  year.”    Id.    CMS \ncommissioned Abt Associates to complete this research study.  See ABT ASSOCIATES, \nNursing  Home  Staffing  Study  Comprehensive  Report  (June  2023), \nhttps://edit.cms.gov/files/document/nursing-home-staffing-study-final-report-appendix-\njune-2023.pdf.   \nAbt Associates’ study (the study) found that increased staffing improves patient \nwelfare in LTC facilities but also recognized the pervasive staffing challenges in the \nindustry.  Specifically, the study found that nursing homes with higher staff-to-resident \nratios provide better care and addressed the COVID-19 pandemic more successfully.  Id. \nat 1; Doc. 72 at 17.  However, the study noted that existing literature “does not provide \na clear evidence basis for setting a minimum staffing level.”  ABT ASSOCIATES, Nursing \nHome Staffing Study Comprehensive Report at xi.  The study also found that increases \nin the nurse hours per resident per day result in a “corresponding increase in potential \nquality and safety improvements, and a decrease in expected delayed and omitted care.”  \nId. at xiii; Doc. 72 at 17.  Although Abt Associates found that increased staffing will \nlead to better care, the study recounted that nursing homes are struggling to hire and \nretain workers.  Additionally, stakeholders expressed a variety of concerns, including \n3 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 3 of 21\n\nlack of adequate staffing as well as workforce and cost constraints.  ABT ASSOCIATES, \nNursing  Home  Staffing  Study  Comprehensive  Report  at  xii.    Moreover,  some \nstakeholders suggested that resident acuity should be considered when setting a minimum \nstaffing requirement.  Id. \n  Upon  completion  of  the  study,  CMS  issued  a  notice  of  a  proposed  rule  in \nSeptember 2023.  The proposed rule contained four main proposals: (1) a requirement \nthat a registered nurse (RN) must be on site 24 hours per day, 7 days a week, (2) minimum \nnurse staffing standards of 0.55 hours per resident day (HPRD) for RNs and 2.45 HPRD \nfor Nurse Aids (NAs), (3) enhanced facility assessment (EFA) requirements and (4) \nMedicaid reporting requirements.  Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing \nStandards  for  Long-Term  Care  Facilities  and  Medicaid  Institutional  Payment \nTransparency Reporting, 88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (proposed Sept. 6, 2023).  CMS received \n46,520  comments  in  response  to  the  proposed  rule.    See  Medicare  and  Medicaid \nPrograms;  Minimum  Staffing  Standards  for  Long-Term  Facilities  and  Medicaid \nInstitutional Payment Transparency Reporting, 89 Fed. Reg. 40883 (May 10, 2024).   \nCMS’s Final Rule, promulgated on May 10, 2024, largely mirrors the proposed \nrule.  89 Fed. Reg. 40876.  The Final Rule includes: (1) a requirement that a RN be on \nsite 24 hours per day, 7 days per week, (2) a minimum nursing staffing standard of 3.48 \nHPRD of nursing care, with at least 0.55 RN HPRD and at least 2.45 NA HRPD, (3) \nrevision of the existing facility assessment requirements and (4) Medicaid institutional \npayment transparency reporting requirements.  89 Fed. Reg. 40877.  To ease some of \nthe Final Rule’s financial burden, CMS has dedicated over $75 million “to launch an \ninitiative  to  help  increase  the  long-term  care  workforce.”    89  Fed.  Reg.  40885.  \nMoreover, the Final Rule provides additional time and flexibility for LTC facilities to \nimplement the changes, including staggered implementation dates over a five-year period \nand providing for some exemptions from the minimum staffing standards.  89 Fed. Reg. \n40886. \n4 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 4 of 21\n\nIn its Final Rule, CMS asserts that various provisions in Sections 1819 and 1919 \nof the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3 and 1396r] grant it authority for the \nissuance of the HPRD and 24/7 RN requirements.3  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40890-91.  First, \nCMS states that §§ 1819(d)(4)(B) and 1919(d)(4)(B) of the Social Security Act support \nits authority to establish these requirements, as these sections “instruct the Secretary to \nissue such regulations relating to the health, safety, and well-being of residents as the \nSecretary may find necessary.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40890.  Moreover, CMS contends that §§ \n1819(b)(2) and 1919(b)(2) provide additional support for CMS’s authority to establish \nthese requirements, as those sections “require facilities to provide services to attain or \nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each \nresident.”  Id.   \nFinally, CMS states that §§ 1819(b)(1)(A) and 1919(b)(1)(A) “require that a SNF \n[skilled nursing facility] or NF [nursing facility] must care for its residents in such a \nmanner and in such an environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the \nsafety and quality of life of each resident,” which it asserts provides further support for \nthe Final Rule’s staffing requirements.  89 Fed. Reg. 40891.  However, as the plaintiffs \nassert and the Government concedes in its brief, the only provisions of the Social Security \nAct that expressly permit the promulgation of additional requirements by the Secretary \nare §§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(b) and 1396r(d)(4)(B), which state that LTC facilities must “meet \nsuch other requirements relating to the health, safety, and well-being of residents or \nrelating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.”  See Doc. \n30-1 at 23; see also Doc. 72 at 21-22.  \n \n3 The Medicare and Medicaid statutes speak directly to staffing requirements as well.  They \nrequire LTC facilities to “provide 24-hour licensed nursing service which is sufficient to meet \nthe nursing needs of its residents” and “use the services of a registered professional nurse at \nleast  8  consecutive  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week.”    See  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) \n(Medicare); see also 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i) (Medicaid) (same).  Both statutes permit \nwaivers for these requirements.  See 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(ii) (Medicare) and 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396r(b)(3)(C)(ii) (Medicaid).   \n5 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 5 of 21\n\nAlthough the statutory basis for CMS’s promulgation of new Medicaid reporting \nrequirements do not appear to be contested by the plaintiffs (see Doc. 30-1 at 6), CMS \nasserts that it relied on two main provisions of the Social Security Act to issue these \nrequirements – §§ 1902(a)(30)(A) and 1902(a)(6).  89 Fed. Reg. 40914 (noting that § \n1902(a)(30)(A) “requires State Medicaid programs to ensure that payments to providers \nare consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care. . .” and § 1902(a)(6) \n“requires State Medicaid agencies to make such reports. . . as the Secretary may from \ntime to time require, and to comply with such provisions as the Secretary may find \nnecessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports.”).  \nThe statutory basis for the EFA requirement appears similarly uncontested by the \nplaintiffs.  See Doc. 30-1 at 6.  Prior to the promulgation of the Final Rule, LTC facilities \nwere already required to complete facility assessments.  The Final Rule relocated the \nfacility assessment requirement from a subpart to a stand-alone provision and added new \nsubstantive  requirements.    CMS  did  not  articulate  the  statutory  basis  for  the  new \nsubstantive requirements in the Final Rule.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40905.   \nEach requirement of the Final Rule has a different implementation timeline.  The \n24/7 RN requirement must be implemented by May 11, 2026, for non-rural facilities and \nby May 10, 2027, for rural facilities as defined by the Office of Management and Budget.  \nThe HRPD requirements must be implemented by May 10, 2027, for non-rural facilities \nand by May 10, 2029, for rural facilities.  The EFA requirement took effect on August \n8, 2024, for all facilities.  The Medicaid transparency reporting requirements must be \nimplemented by all States and territories with Medicaid-certified facilities by May 10, \n2028.  89 Fed. Reg. 40876. \nDespite these different implementation timelines, the Final Rule acknowledges that \ncosts  will  be  incurred  before  the  respective  effective  implementation  dates.    CMS \nestimated that the staffing requirements will result in an estimated cost of approximately \n$53 million in year one, $1.43 billion in year two and $4.38 billion in year three.  89 \n6 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 6 of 21\n\nFed. Reg. 40949.  Additionally, CMS estimates that the Medicaid reporting provision \nwill cost states $183,851 for the first four years.   89 Fed. Reg. 40991. \n \nIII.  ANALYSIS \n  The plaintiffs seek entry of a preliminary injunction as to the entire Final Rule.  \nThey assert that the Final Rule exceeds CMS’s statutory authority, violates the major \nquestions doctrine and is arbitrary and capricious.  See Doc. 30-1 at 20-35.  Additionally, \nthe plaintiffs assert that they are suffering irreparable harm from the financial burdens of \nthe Final Rule and contend that the balance of equities and the public interest favor \ninjunctive relief.  Id. at 35-38.  Finally, they request that the injunction apply nationwide \nto “preserve[] the national status quo and protect[] Plaintiffs from the Final Rule’s \ndestabilizing effects on nursing homes across the country.”  Doc. 30-1 at 39.   \n \nA.  Preliminary Injunction Standard \nThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is to “preserve the relative positions of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 \nU.S. 390, 395 (1981).  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated: \nWhen evaluating whether to issue a preliminary injunction, a district court \nshould consider four factors: (1) the threat of irreparable harm to the \nmovant; (2) the state of the balance between this harm and the injury that \ngranting the injunction will inflict on other parties; (3) the probability that \nthe movant will succeed on the merits; and (4) the public interest. \n  \nRoudachevski v. All–American Care Centers, Inc., 648 F.3d 701, 705 (8th Cir. 2011) \n(citing Dataphase Sys., Inc. v. C L Sys., Inc., 640 F.2d 109, 114 (8th Cir. 1981) (en \nbanc)).  In this circuit, these are often referred to as the “Dataphase” factors.  While no \nsingle factor is dispositive, the Eighth Circuit has stated that “likelihood of success on \nthe merits is most significant.”  Laclede Gas Co. v. St. Charles Cnty., Mo., 713 F.3d \n413, 419 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Minn. Ass’n of Nurse Anesthetists v. Unity Hosp., 59 \nF.3d 80, 83 (8th Cir. 1995)).   \n7 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 7 of 21\n\nIn applying these factors, the court must keep in mind that a preliminary injunction \nis “an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Morehouse Enters., LLC v. \nBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 78 F.4th 1011, 1016 (8th Cir. 2023) \n(citation omitted).  As such, the party seeking injunctive relief bears the burden of proving \nthat it is appropriate.  Roudachevski, 648 F.3d at 705.  “When there is an adequate \nremedy at law, a preliminary injunction is not appropriate.”  Watkins Inc. v. Lewis, 346 \nF.3d 841, 844 (8th Cir. 2003) (citing Modern Computer Sys., Inc. v. Modern Banking \nSys., Inc., 871 F.2d 734, 738 (8th Cir. 1989)). \n \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nAlthough  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  often  described  as  the  most \nsignificant factor in a preliminary injunction analysis, a failure to show irreparable harm \nmay be dispositive.  Adventist Health Sys./SunBelt, Inc. v. United States Dep't of Health \n& Hum. Servs., 17 F.4th 793, 806 (8th Cir. 2021) (“The failure to show irreparable harm \nis an ‘independently sufficient basis upon which to deny a preliminary injunction.’”) \n(citation omitted); see also Glenwood Bridge, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 940 F.2d 367, \n371 (8th Cir. 1991) (irreparable harm is a “threshold inquiry” in granting or denying \npreliminary injunction).  I will begin my analysis with this factor because, for the reasons \ndiscussed in detail below, it largely dictates the outcome of the plaintiffs’ motion for a \npreliminary injunction. \nTo demonstrate irreparable harm, “a party must show that the harm is certain and \ngreat and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.”  \nMorehouse Enters., LLC v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 78 \nF.4th 1011, 1017 (8th Cir. 2023) (quoting Dakotans for Health v. Noem, 52 F.4th 381, \n392 (8th Cir. 2022); see also Tumey v. Mycroft AI, Inc., 27 F.4th 657, 665 (8th Cir. \n2022) (“The movant must show that ‘irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction,’ not merely a ‘possibility’ of irreparable harm before a decision on the merits \ncan be rendered.”) (emphasis in original) (quoting Winter v. Natural Resources Defense \n8 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 8 of 21\n\nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  The irreparable harm requirement is demanding.  \nSee Am. Meat Inst. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 968 F. Supp. 2d 38, 75 (D.D.C. 2013) \n(“There is no doubt that ‘[t]he irreparable injury requirement erects a very high bar for \na movant.’”)  (quoting Coalition for Common Sense in Gov't Procurement v. United \nStates, 576 F. Supp. 2d 162, 168 (D.D.C. 2008)). \n \n1.   The Parties’ Arguments  \nThe Organizations argue that they will suffer irreparable harm from the Final Rule \nbecause of the financial strain that it imposes, workforce shortages, current compliance \ncosts and the burdensome EFA requirements.  Doc. 30-1 at 35-36.  First, they argue that \nthe Final Rule will cost each LTC facility hundreds of thousands of dollars to implement.4   \nId. at 35.  Further, they contend that the additional hiring required by the Final Rule is \nnearly  impossible  considering  the  healthcare  workforce  shortages,  which  are  more \nexacerbated in the long-term care setting.  Id. at 35-36.  Because of these workforce \nchallenges, the Organizations assert that many LTC facilities must start complying with \nthe staffing mandates now to ensure that they will meet the requirements by the designated \nimplementation  dates.    Id.  at  36.  Finally,  they  argue  that  the  Final  Rule’s  EFA \nrequirement, which is already in effect, imposes significant costs and administrative \nburdens.  Id.    \nThe States contend that they will experience many of the same harms as the \nOrganizations.  First, they argue that state-run LTC facilities will experience the similar \nfinancial  hardships  as  the  organizational  LTC  facilities  with  the  increased  staffing \nrequirements, workforce shortages and the EFA requirements.  Id. at 36-37.  The States \nassert that they will incur additional Medicaid and Medicare expenses and costs due to \n \n4 For example, the plaintiffs assert that in South Carolina the estimated implementation cost is \nover $550,000 per nursing home.  This cost is even higher in Pennsylvania, with an estimated \ncost of $689,000 per provider.  Doc. 30-1 at 35.  \n9 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 9 of 21\n\nthe Medicaid reporting requirement and the increased staffing costs at LTC facilities.  Id. \nat 37.  Finally, the States argue that they will incur additional administrative costs with \ncomplaints and waiver requests as they predict that LTC facilities will be unable to \ncomply with the Final Rule.  Id.  \nThe  Government  asserts  that  because  the  24/7  RN  requirement  and  HPRD \nrequirements will not be implemented for several years, the plaintiffs will not experience \nirreparable harm without an injunction.  Doc. 72 at 60.  The Government does not address \nirreparable harm regarding the EFA and Medicaid reporting requirements, as it contends \nthat the plaintiffs do not substantively challenge those provisions.5  Id.  The Government \nasserts  that  the  Final  Rule  has  a  staggered  implementation  for  both  the  24/7  RN \nrequirement and the HPRD requirements.  Id.; see 89 Fed. Reg. 40894 (discussing \n“phased implementation up to 5 years for rural facilities and up to 3 years for non-rural \nfacilities”).  The Government further notes that the earliest any facility could be harmed \nby the Final Rule is in two years—when the 24/7 RN rule will take effect in urban areas.  \nDoc.  72  at  60;  see  89  Fed.  Reg.  40910.    It  asserts  that  this  multi-year  delay  in \nimplementation does not create irreparable harm, as the merits of the plaintiffs’ challenge \ncan be resolved in less than two years.  Doc. 72 at 60.  Moreover, the Government \ncontends that the harms alleged by the plaintiffs are “purely economic,” “self-inflicted” \nand, as to the plaintiffs’ argument regarding workforce shortages—not caused by the \nFinal Rule.  Id. at 61.  Finally, the Government argues that the plaintiffs’ delay in filing \n \n5 In their reply brief and during oral argument, the plaintiffs maintained that they are challenging \nthe entirety of the rule – not just the 24/7 RN requirement and the HPRD requirements.  See \nDoc. 78 at 20-21; see also Doc. 94 at 26.  However, the plaintiffs did not address either the \nEFA requirement or the Medicaid reporting requirement in their discussion of likelihood of \nsuccess in their briefs. See Doc. 30-1 at 20-35; see also Doc. 78 at 4-17.  Nonetheless, the \nplaintiffs assert that they made sufficient arguments as to likelihood of success as they contended \nthat the EFA provision was “vague” and “unreasonable.”  Doc. 78 at 21.  The Government \nmaintains that the plaintiffs did not address likelihood of success on the merits with respect to \nthe EFA requirement, but it asserts that in any case, the deadline for compliance with this \nrequirement has already passed so irreparable harm cannot be alleged.  Doc. 72 at 62.   \n10 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 10 of 21\n\nthe present motion for a preliminary injunction also undercuts their assertion that they \nare suffering irreparable harm.  Id. at 62. \n  In response, the plaintiffs first contend that the economic nature of the harm is not \na barrier to the court’s entry of a preliminary injunction, as monetary damages cannot be \nrecovered from the federal government due to sovereign immunity.  Doc. 78 at 19.  \nAdditionally, they assert that the harms from the EFA requirement are continuous and \nongoing.  Id.  Moreover, they dispute that they are engaged in “self-harm” by beginning \nto hire staff to meet the Final Rule’s requirements, as they contend that the delayed \nimplementation period was specifically designed for this purpose.  Id. at 20.  Finally, \nthey assert that their delay in seeking injunctive relief was not unreasonable.  Id. at 22.  \n   \n2.  Substantive Provisions of the Final Rule \nBecause  the  plaintiffs’  allegations  of  irreparable  harm  primarily  concern \ncompliance costs associated with the Final Rule, I will first address that matter.  There \nappears to be a circuit split as to whether compliance costs constitute irreparable harm.  \nSome circuits have held that “compliance costs do not qualify as irreparable harm because \nthey commonly result from new government regulation.”  See Commonwealth v. Biden, \n57 F.4th 545, 556 (6th Cir. 2023) (recognizing that many of their “sister circuits” have \nheld that compliance costs are not irreparable harm but holding that “the peculiarity and \nsize of a harm affects its weight in the equitable balance”) (citing Freedom Holdings, Inc. \nv. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 115 (2d Cir. 2005), Am. Hosp. Ass'n v. Harris, 625 F.2d 1328, \n1331 (7th Cir. 1980), and A.O. Smith Corp. v. FTC, 530 F.2d 515, 527 (3d Cir. 1976)).  \nOther circuits have found that complying with a regulation later held invalid almost \nalways produces irreparable harm from nonrecoverable costs.  See Texas v. EPA, 829 \nF.3d 405, 433 (5th Cir. 2016); see also Crowe & Dunlevy, P.C. v. Stidham, 640 F.3d \n1140, 1157 (10th Cir. 2011).   \nAlthough this issue has never been squarely addressed by the Eighth Circuit, the \ncourt has stated that “[t]he importance of preliminary injunctive relief is heightened” \n11 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 11 of 21\n\nwhen monetary damages are unavailable because of sovereign immunity.  Entergy, \nArkansas,  Inc.  v.  Nebraska,  210  F.3d  887,  899  (8th  Cir.  2000).    I  hold  that  the \ncompliance costs incurred to comply with a potentially invalid regulation, such as the \nFinal Rule, may constitute irreparable harm.  I will address each aspect of the Final Rule \nin turn. \n \n  a.   24/7 RN Requirement and HPRD Requirements \nAt this stage of the case, I will assume that the Final Rule’s 24/7 RN requirement \nand HPRD requirements will impose tremendous costs on LTC facilities that could result \nin closures if compliance is not economically feasible.  Additionally, the economic nature \nof the plaintiffs’ alleged harms does not preclude relief.  Although economic loss is not \nirreparable harm if damages are available, losses will not be recoverable from the \nGovernment due to sovereign immunity.  See Gen. Motors Corp. v. Harry Brown’s LLC, \n563 F.3d 312, 319 (8th Cir. 2009) (“economic loss is not irreparable harm so long as \nlosses are recoverable”); see also Entergy, Arkansas, Inc., 210 F.3d at 899 (“[t]he \nimportance of preliminary injunctive relief is heightened” when monetary damages are \nunavailable because of sovereign immunity).   \nHowever, because the 24/7 RN requirement and the HPRD requirements do not \ntake effect until May 2026, at the earliest, I find that the plaintiffs’ challenges to the \nfinancial and compliance burdens presented by those requirements are too speculative to \nconstitute irreparable harm for purpose of a preliminary injunction.6  In seeking injunctive \nrelief, a party must show that the injury alleged is “of such imminence that there is a \n \n6 Additionally, the plaintiffs’ argument that workforce shortages in the healthcare industry \nconstitute irreparable harm is misplaced.  The Final Rule did not create the workforce shortage \nin the healthcare industry.  Such an argument is proper in challenging CMS’s action as arbitrary \nand capricious—not in alleging that the Final Rule causes irreparable harm.  See McClung v. \nPaul, 788 F.3d 822, 828 (8th Cir. 2015) (finding an agency decision arbitrary and capricious if \nan agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem”).   \n \n12 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 12 of 21\n\nclear and present need for equitable relief.”  Morehouse Enters., LLC v. Bureau of \nAlcohol,  Tobacco,  Firearms  &  Explosives,  78  F.4th  1011,  1018  (8th  Cir.  2023) \n(emphasis in original) (quotations omitted) (citations omitted).  The plaintiffs allege that \nLTC  facilities  are  bearing  the  costs  of  the  24/7  RN  requirement  and  the  HPRD \nrequirements now because of the workforce shortages in the healthcare industry.  Doc. \n30-1 at 36.  However, the extent to which LTC facilities are incurring hiring costs now \nto ensure compliance with the Final Rule is unclear.  Indeed, while 26 plaintiffs submitted \ndeclarations, only a few state that they are currently engaged in hiring and incurring costs \nto ensure compliance with the minimum staffing requirements.7  See Doc 30-22 at 9, ¶ \n11  (“At  least  several  of  our  nursing  homes  are  already  making  staffing  changes, \nattempting to hire additional RNs rather than LPNs, and increasing hiring efforts in \npreparation for the Final Rule’s staffing mandates going into effect.”); Doc. 30-10 at 8, \n¶ 9 (LTC facilities in Iowa “are attempting to hire RNs over LPNs whenever possible. . \n. and engaging in aggressive recruitment strategies such as sign-on and recruitment \nbonuses. . .”); Doc. 30-12 at 3-4, ¶ 6 (“our members have already begun to plan for the \nelimination of LPN positions”).  While these declarations suggest that planning and \nattempts for hiring are currently taking place, the financial burden of these undertakings \nis unclear.  None of the plaintiffs submitted data or cost breakdowns as to their current \nhiring efforts.   \n  Instead, most of the declarations detail costs that the various plaintiffs will incur \nin the future.  Indeed, many plaintiffs provided a wide range of potential costs.  See, \ne.g., Doc. 30-2 at 3, ¶ 9 (estimating that the total average costs for Idaho-operated LTC \nfacilities to comply with the Final Rule’s minimum staffing requirements to be $800,000 \n \n7 The plaintiffs assert that a declaration from LeadingAge South Carolina provides additional \nsupport for their assertion that many providers are already expending resources towards hiring.  \nDoc. 30-1 at 36 (citing Doc. 30-20 at 3, ¶ 4).  However, LeadingAge South Carolina’s \ndeclaration merely asserts that it is currently experiencing staffing shortages and that one facility \nhas had an open RN position for over a year.  Doc. 30-20 at 3, ¶ 4.   \n13 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 13 of 21\n\nper facility); see also Doc. 30-8 at 5, ¶ 7 (asserting that the South Dakota Association of \nHealth Care Organizations estimated that costs associated with temporary/travel nurses \nto be between $300,000 and $1,600,000 per year and estimates that this cost will increase \n“exponentially if the Final Rule’s staffing mandate goes into effect”); see Doc. 30-22 at \n2, ¶ 5 (stating that the “significant and irreparable harm that the Final Rule imposes on \nVirginia nursing home providers will be especially severe in rural and underserved \nareas”).  These wide ranges demonstrate that while the staffing requirements of the Final \nRule will certainly impose financial burdens, the extent of the harm is simply too \nuncertain at this point, as the earliest any facility could be subject to the Final Rule is \nMay 11, 2026.  This weighs against a finding of irreparable harm.  See S.J.W. ex rel. \nWilson v. Lee's Summit R-7 Sch. Dist., 696 F.3d 771, 779 (8th Cir. 2012) (“Speculative \nharm does not support a preliminary injunction.”); see also Mock v. Garland, 697 F. \nSupp. 3d 564, 577 (N.D. Tex. 2023) (“Irreparable harm must also be concrete, non-\nspeculative, and more than merely de minimis.”) (emphasis omitted).   \nFurther,  many  of  the  plaintiffs’  declarations  note  that  the  compliance  costs \nassociated with the Final Rule’s staffing mandate could greatly vary depending on their \nuse of contracting agencies to recruit staff.  See Doc. 30-2 at 3, ¶ 10 (noting that hiring \ncosts  could  be  “higher  or  lower”  depending  on  the  state’s  reliance  on  contractor \nagencies); see also Doc. 30-8 at 6, ¶ 8 (“The cost for facilities will be even greater if \ncontract staff are needed to meet the standards of the mandate.”); Doc. 30-11 at 9, ¶ 12 \n(“Nursing  homes  will  incur  substantial  costs,  potentially  requiring  them  to  rely  on \ncontracted nursing agencies, which are significantly more expensive.”).  This also weighs \nagainst a finding of irreparable harm.  See, e.g., Cayuga Nation v. Zinke, 302 F. Supp. \n3d 362, 373 (D.D.C. 2018) (finding that where “injuries depend on actions that may or \nmay not be taken by. . . non-parties over which this Court does not have control, they \nare not certain[]” which “counsel[s] against granting preliminary injunctive relief.”). \nNonetheless, some of the plaintiff declarations provided more precise estimates of \nfuture costs.  See, e.g., Doc. 30-9 at 3, ¶ 6 (Final Rule’s requirements “will cost each \n14 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 14 of 21\n\nColorado provider. . . an average of $399,123 per year”); see also Doc. 30-11 at 3, ¶ 6 \n(staffing mandate will cost each Kansas provider an average of $211,905 per year); see \nalso Doc. 30-12 at 2, ¶ 5 (staffing mandate will cost each nursing home in Maryland an \nadditional $642,000 per year); see Doc. 30-3 at 3, ¶ 10 (noting that over 70 percent of \nfacilities in Iowa will be affected by the increased staffing requirements, which will cause \nan estimated state financial impact of over $25 million); see Doc. 30-10 at 3-4, ¶ 4a \n(noting that staffing requirements would result in $2.16 million annual costs on their \nmembers).    While  I  appreciate  the  detailed  assessments  provided  by  many  of  the \nplaintiffs, I again find that because of the delayed implementation of the Final Rule, the \nplaintiffs have not adequately shown irreparable harm as to the staffing requirements.  \nSee Wyoming v. United States Dep't of the Interior, No. C16- 0280–SWS, 2017 WL \n161428, at *11 (D. Wyo. Jan. 16, 2017) (holding that even though the Regulatory Impact \nAnalysis stated that the Rule’s requirements “would necessitate immediate expenditures,” \nbecause many of the Rule’s requirements “do not take effect for a year[,] . . . any alleged \nexpenses associated with ‘immediate action to begin Rule implementation and compliance \nplanning’  are  simply  too  uncertain  and  speculative  to  constitute  irreparable  harm”) \n(emphasis in original) (citation omitted); cf. Chlorine Inst., Inc. v. Soo Line R.R., 792 \nF.3d 903, 915 (8th Cir. 2015) (noting that “[a]ppellants’ assertion” that a harm would \n“inevitably result” was “too speculative” and thus insufficient to show irreparable harm).   \nThe merits of the plaintiffs’ challenges to the 24/7 RN requirement and the HPRD \nrequirements can be addressed before May 2026, when the first staffing requirements of \nthe Final Rule are to take effect.  See Am. Meat Inst. v. U.S. Dep't of Agric., 968 F. \nSupp. 2d 38, 75 (D.D.C. 2013) (“Perhaps the single most important prerequisite for the \nissuance of a preliminary injunction is a demonstration that if it is not granted the \napplicant is likely to suffer irreparable harm before a decision on the merits can be \nrendered.”).  The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that injunctive relief is necessary to \nprevent irreparable harm as to those aspects of the Final Rule.   \n \n15 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 15 of 21\n\n  b.   EFA Requirement \nThe EFA requirement took effect on August 8, 2024.  89 Fed. Reg. 40876.  As \nthe initial compliance date for the EFA requirement has already passed, the Government \nasserts that the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate irreparable harm with respect to this aspect \nof the Final Rule.  Doc. 72 at 62.  \nThe Eighth Circuit has found that prior harm weighs against entering injunctive \nrelief when a plaintiff can recover damages.  See CDI Energy Servs. v. West River Pumps, \nInc., 567 F.3d 398, 403 (8th Cir. 2009) (“[I]t was appropriate for the district court to \nview the irreparable-harm factor as weighing against the issuance of a preliminary \ninjunction.  The harm that had already occurred could be remedied through damages.”); \nsee  also Adam–Mellang  v.  Apartment  Search,  Inc., 96  F.3d  297,  300  (8th  Cir. \n1996) (declining to enter a preliminary injunction when a plaintiff had “an adequate \nremedy at law, namely, the damages and other relief to which she will be entitled if she \nprevails”).  Here, of course, the plaintiffs cannot recover damages from the Government \ndue to sovereign immunity.  Moreover, the Final Rule requires facilities to “review and \nupdate that assessment, as necessary, and at least annually.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40999.  Thus, \nthe costs of compliance with the EFA requirement will recur on an ongoing basis.  These \nfactors tend to add some support for a finding that the EFA requirement will cause \nirreparable harm absent injunctive relief.     \nBecause the plaintiffs have made a more feasible showing of irreparable harm with \nregard to the EFA requirement, I will consider their likelihood of success on their \nchallenge to this provision.  Ultimately, I agree with the Government that because the \nplaintiffs addressed the likelihood of success element only with respect to the 24/7 RN \nrequirement and the HPRD requirements, they have not demonstrated that a preliminary \ninjunction is appropriate with respect to the EFA requirement.   \nThe plaintiffs raise only a few conclusory arguments regarding likelihood of \nsuccess  as  to  that  requirement.    First,  they  claim  that  they  asserted  that  the  EFA \nrequirement is “vague” and “unreasonable.”  Doc. 78 at 21.  During oral argument, the \n16 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 16 of 21\n\nplaintiffs asserted that the Final Rule is not severable and their arguments regarding the \n“arbitrary and capricious” nature of the Final Rule apply to the EFA requirement.  Doc. \n94 at 26-27.  Moreover, the plaintiffs assert that Missouri v. Biden, 112 F.4th 531 (8th \nCir. 2024), stands for the proposition that “irreparable harm does not need to be tied to \nany particular aspect of the rule that’s being challenged.”  Doc. 94 at 26-27, 59.  \nThese arguments are not compelling.  The plaintiffs’ conclusory argument that the \nEFA requirement is “vague” and “unreasonable” is insufficient to support a finding of \nlikelihood of success on the merits.8  Additionally, I do not find Missouri v. Biden to be \nparticularly helpful.  In that case, the Eighth Circuit stated the “district court only \nenjoined the ultimate forgiveness of loans, finding that States had not shown irreparable \nharm” with respect to two other provisions of the rule.  Biden, 112 F.4th at 535.  \nNotwithstanding the district court’s injunction, the Government continued to forgive \nloans through a new “hybrid rule,” which combined parts of the non-enjoined rule as \nwell as provisions in another regulation.  The Eighth Circuit noted that this hybrid rule \n“effectively rendered that injunction a nullity.”  Id. at 535.   \nAlthough the Eighth Circuit ultimately enjoined the entire rule, it did so only \nbecause the Government created a hybrid rule that made the district court’s injunction \nuseless.  Missouri v. Biden does not stand for the proposition that a plaintiff may cherry-\npick portions of a final rule, arguing likelihood of success as to some and irreparable \nharm as to others.  Given plaintiffs’ failure to make any serious argument that they are \nlikely to succeed on their challenge to the EFA requirement, I find that they have failed \nto demonstrate that a preliminary injunction as to that requirement is appropriate. \n \n \n8 Indeed, “[w]hen a party seeks to enjoin a government regulation that is ‘based on presumptively \nreasoned democratic processes,’. . . we apply a ‘more rigorous threshold showing’ than just a \n‘fair chance’ of success on the merits.  Firearms Regul. Accountability Coal., Inc. v. Garland, \n112 F.4th 507, 517 (8th Cir. 2024) (quoting Planned Parenthood Minn., N.D., S.D. v. Rounds, \n530 F.3d 724, 730, 732 (8th Cir. 2008) (en banc).  Therefore, such conclusory arguments do \nnot come close to meeting the required showing. \n17 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 17 of 21\n\nc.  Medicaid Transparency Reporting Requirements   \nThe Medicaid institutional transparency reporting requirement does not take effect \nuntil May 10, 2028.  89 Fed. Reg. 40876.  As with the 24/7 RN and the HPRD \nrequirements, I find that this long-delayed effective date renders the alleged expenses \nassociated with immediate action too uncertain and speculative to qualify as irreparable \nharm.  Indeed, many of the plaintiffs’ declarations make conclusory statements about the \nfuture economic harm they will incur.  See, e.g., Doc. 30-4 at 3, ¶ 8 (“Although this \nrequirement does not take effect until four years after the Final Rule is published, it will \nimpose costs on Nebraska well before that.”); Doc. 30-3 at 3, ¶ 8 (same); Doc. 30-27 at \n3, ¶ 8 (same); Doc. 30-7 at 3, ¶ 7 (same).  Moreover, the merits of the plaintiffs’ \nchallenge to this provision can be resolved before this requirement takes effect.  See infra \nSection III.B.2.a.9  \n \nd.   Plaintiffs’ Delay \nFinally, the Government argues that the plaintiffs’ delay in bringing a motion for \na preliminary injunction of the Final Rule weighs against a finding of irreparable harm.  \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is largely unnecessary to address the “delay” argument.  \nIn short, the Government argues that the five-month delay between publication of the \nFinal Rule and the request for a preliminary injunction was excessive and weighs against \na finding of irreparable harm.  The Government notes the Texas Health Care Association \nand several Texas-based LTC facilities filed suit challenging the Final Rule on the same \ngrounds as the plaintiffs “less than two weeks after the promulgation of the Final Rule.”  \nDoc. 72 at 62; see Am. Health 52 Care Ass’n v. Becerra, 24C-114-Z-BR (N.D. Tex.) \n(filed May 23, 2024).  Further, it asserts that the Eighth Circuit has held that a delay of \n \n9 Additionally, as with the EFA requirement, the plaintiffs did not make any arguments regarding \nthe likelihood of success on the merits with respect to the Medicaid reporting requirement.  See \ngenerally Doc. 30-1 and Doc. 78.  Therefore, even if I found that the plaintiffs made a showing \nof irreparable harm, injunctive relief would not be appropriate.  See infra Section III.B.2.b. \n18 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 18 of 21\n\nfive months in seeking a preliminary injunction was sufficient to affirm the denial of a \npreliminary injunction.  Doc. 72 at 63; see Phyllis Schlafly Revocable Trust v. Cori, 924 \nF.3d 1004, 1010, n.4 (8th Cir. 2019). \nThe plaintiffs contend that their delay was less than two months, as the EFA \nrequirement did not take effect until August and they sought injunctive relief in October.  \nDoc. 94 at 58.  Additionally, they assert that the length of the delay is not outcome-\ndeterminative but, instead, turns on the facts of the case.  Doc. 78 at 22.  They argue \nthat they were “forced to walk a tightrope,” as if they challenged the rule earlier, the \nGovernment would have argued that their harms were speculative and uncertain.  Id.  By \nwaiting, they contend that their harms are concrete because the EFA requirement took \neffect and many LTC facilities are beginning to take measures to ensure they can meet \nthe staffing requirements.  Id.   \nThe “mere length of the delay is not determinative of whether the delay was \nreasonable.”  Ng v. Board of Regents of University of Minnesota, 64 F.4th 992, 998 (8th \nCir. 2023) (noting that the Eighth Circuit has found delays of seven and eight months to \nbe reasonable but has found delays of five and seventeen months to be unreasonable).  \nAnd there can be little doubt that a comprehensive challenge to an agency final rule \nrequires time and significant resources to litigate.  See McKinney ex rel. N.L.R.B. v. S. \nBakeries, LLC, 786 F.3d 1119, 1125 (8th Cir. 2015) (noting that “[c]omplicated labor \ndisputes like this one require time to investigate and litigate”).   Nonetheless, many of \nthe  plaintiffs  participated  in  the  rulemaking  process  and  submitted  analyses  of  the \nexpected costs and hardships of the rule.  This participation suggests that waiting five \n19 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 19 of 21\n\nmonths to challenge the rule was unnecessary, as many had already conducted research \nto assess the costs and harms that they would face.10   \nOn the other hand, the delay in this case was not as egregious as delays seen in \nother cases.  See, e.g., Adventist Health Sys., 17 F.4th at 805 (holding that the district \ncourt did not abuse its discretion in finding no irreparable harm where the plaintiffs did \nnot challenge the Final Rule for a year after its adoption and fewer than five days before \nits scheduled implementation); see also Novus Franchising, Inc. v. Dawson, 725 F.3d \n885, 894 (8th Cir. 2013) (finding that a delay of 17 months “rebuts any inference of \nirreparable harm”).  Indeed, it appears that five months is the shortest time period that \nthe Eighth Circuit has found to be unreasonable.   \nUltimately, I find the plaintiffs’ delay seeking a preliminary injunction is largely \na non-factor that, at most, adds some additional, marginal support for the conclusion that \nthe plaintiffs failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.   \n \nC.  Summary \n  As noted above, a preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy never \nawarded as of right.”  Morehouse Enterprises, LLC, 78 F.4th at 1016.  With regard to \nnearly every aspect of the Final Rule, the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that a \npreliminary injunction is necessary in order to preserve the status quo and prevent \nirreparable harm during the pendency of these proceedings.  The only potential exception \ninvolves the Final Rule’s EFA requirement.  However, the plaintiffs advanced no viable \n \n10 See generally “Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-\nTerm  Care  Facilities  and  Medicaid  Institutional  Payment  Transparency  Reporting,” \nRegulations.gov,  https://www.regulations.gov/document/CMS-2023-0144-0001/comment \n(Sept. 6, 2023); see, e.g., Leading Age Nebraska, CMS-2023-0144-25564 (Nov. 3, 2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-25564  and  Leading  Age  PA,  CMS-\n2023-0144-25410  (Nov.  3,  2023),  https://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-\n25410. \n20 \n \nCase 1:24-cv-00110-LTS-KEM     Document 95     Filed 01/16/25     Page 20 of 21\n\nargument  that  they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of  their  challenge  to  that \nrequirement.   \n  Under these circumstances, I conclude that the issuance of a preliminary injunction \nis not appropriate.11  I do find, however, that the interests of justice will be best served \nby proceeding quickly to the dispositive motions stage of this case, thus allowing the \nparties to address the merits directly, rather than through the lens of a motion for a \npreliminary injunction.  In particular, the plaintiffs have raised substantial issues and \nconcerns about Final Rule’s 24/7 RN requirement and HPRD requirements.  A schedule \nfor dispositive motion briefing will be set forth below.   \n   \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth herein, the plaintiffs’ motion (Doc. 30) for a preliminary \ninjunction as to the Final Rule is denied.  The following schedule is hereby established \nwith regard to dispositive motions: \n1.  Any dispositive motions must be filed on or before March 3, 2025. \n2.  Resistances must be filed on or before April 3, 2025. \n3.  Reply materials must be filed on or before April 24, 2025.   \n \nIT IS SO ORDERED this 16th day of January, 2025. \n \n \n \n            __________________________ \n            Leonard T. Strand \n            United States District Judge \n \n11 I will therefore not address the remaining Dataphase factors.  I find it equally unnecessary to \naddress the parties’ arguments regarding severability at this time, as I have found that the \nplaintiffs are not entitled to injunctive relief as to any aspect of the Final Rule.  Similarly, it is \nnot necessary for me to address the plaintiffs’ contention that any preliminary injunction should \napply on a nationwide basis.
