Movant seeks to intervene to \"eliminat[e] his payments to enforce the Hoax that fossil fuel could cause harmful global warning\" and \"to stop the fraud.\" See Am. Mot. 85 at 14. Movant has not made a showing that he satisfies the requirements to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a) because he (1) is not given an unconditional right to intervene by any federal statute, nor does he identify one, and (2) does not claim an interest relating to any property of transaction that is the subject of the action and is not so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest. The Court will not exercise its discretion to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1) because movant does not have a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact. Permissive intervention is an inherently discretionary enterprise. EEOC v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C. Cir. 1998).

The Court will not exercise its discretion to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1) because movant does not have a claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact. The Clerk of the Court shall send a copy of this Minute Order to pro se Movant. Signed by Judge Tanya S. Chutkan on 4/15/2025. (lcer)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the freezing of federal grant funds meant for green infrastructure projects. The dispute stemmed from the National Clean Investment Fund, a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which Congress established through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. Climate United was selected as a grantee in April 2024, receiving $6.97 billion in funding to support clean energy projects across the United States, particularly in low-income, rural, and tribal communities. Under the terms of the grant, Climate United&rsquo;s funds were held at Citibank, which served as a financial agent under an Account Control Agreement executed with the EPA.</p>\r\n<p>On March 8, 2025, the Climate United Fund filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against Citibank, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the EPA Administrator. Climate United sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that the defendants unlawfully blocked access to grant funds that had already been awarded and disbursed. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint filed on March 8, 2025 (and a subsequent amended complaint filed March 17), Climate United claimed that Citibank breached its contractual obligations under the ACA by refusing to disburse funds. The lawsuit further accused Citibank of conversion and wrongful withholding of funds. Climate United also claimed the EPA violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending the grant without following legal procedures, violated the Inflation Reduction Act, and that its actions were arbitrary and capricious. The complaint also included a constitutional claim under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, asserting that the EPA had deprived Climate United of a protected property interest without legal justification or process. Further, Climate United argued defendants violated the Appropriations Clause by de-obligating funds appropriated by Congress. Climate United sought a court order requiring Citibank to release the frozen funds, an injunction preventing the EPA from interfering with grant disbursements, and declaratory relief confirming that the EPA&rsquo;s actions were unlawful.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 10, Climate United sought a temporary restraining order requiring Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations under the ACA and requiring EPA to stop impeding Citibank from complying with its contractual obligations. Citibank and the EPA opposed the TRO motion on merits and mootness grounds, arguing Citibank lawfully followed instructions received from the United States Government and, further, that the Grant was terminated on March 11, 2025, ending Climate United' performance and right to request disbursement of funds.</p>\r\n<p>On March 18, 2025, Judge Chutkan granted in part and denied in part the TRO. The order enjoined the EPA and Citibank from giving effect to the EPA termination letter, from transmitting or taking action to implement the termination of Climate United's grants, and from moving or transferring the grant funds to any party other than the account holders. 775 F.Supp.3d 335.</p>\r\n<p>On March 25, Judge Chutkan ordered that this case be consolidated with California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank v. Citibank (<a href=\"../../../../case/46247/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:25-cv-00820</a>); Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, N.A. (<a href=\"../../../../case/46215/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:25-cv-00735</a>); and Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank (<a href=\"../../../../case/46257/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">1:25-cv-00762</a>). This case was designated as the lead case, and all further filings in this case were directed to be filed here.</p>\r\n<p>On March 21, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the EPA from (1) &ldquo;effectuating EPA&rsquo;s March 11, 2025 'Notice of Termination' as to each Plaintiff&rdquo;; (2) &ldquo;unlawfully suspending or terminating Plaintiff's grant awards, including by issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control, effectuating the Notice of Termination, or limiting access to funds in accounts established in connection with plaintiffs&rsquo; grants, including funds in accounts established by plaintiff's subgrantees, except as permitted in accordance with the applicable Account Control Agreement (&ldquo;ACA&rdquo;) with Citibank, the grant awards, and applicable law&rdquo;; or (3) &ldquo;directly or indirectly impeding Citibank or causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts established in connection with plaintiffs&rsquo; grants.&rdquo; The motion further requested the Court to enjoin Citibank from (1) violating its obligations under the ACA, or (2) transferring or moving funds out of accounts established in connection with plaintiffs&rsquo; grants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Chutken granted the preliminary injunction on April 15, enjoining defendants from effectuating the termination letter, terminating grant funds, transferring funds out of accounts, and ordering them to disburse all funds to the plaintiffs. 2025 WL 1118430.</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction pending an appeal \"[b]ecause the government would face immediate irreparable injury through the disbursement of approximately $625 million, and potentially up to $14 billion, in taxpayer funds to external accounts that would be unrecoverable if this court granted the injunctive relief Plaintiffs have requested.\" Plaintiffs' opposition, filed the same day, argued, \"EPA&rsquo;s contingent emergency motion does not add anything of substance to the briefing already before this Court. EPA offers no new arguments on the merits, nor any justification that would entitle it to the &ldquo;extraordinary remedy&rdquo; of a stay pending appeal. If the court issues a preliminary injunction, EPA may appeal that order in the ordinary course, as is its right, but there is no reason for this court to stay its own order pending the appeal. The district court denied the motion to stay on April 15.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, this case was consolidated with Climate Justice Fund v. Environmental Protection Agency (<a href=\"../../../../case/46320/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25-cv-00938-TSC</a>) and Inclusiv, INC, v. Environmental Protection Agency (<a href=\"../../../../case/46324/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">25-cv-00948-TSC</a>).</p>\r\n<p>In the district court, plaintiffs' filed a motion to clarify the preliminary injunction order on April 17, which the court granted April 19. The court again clarified that defendant Citibank must disburse any funds properly incurred since the mid-February suspension of plaintiffs' funds. 2025 WL 1569275.</p>\r\n<p>Both the federal defendants and Citibank appealed the preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Court of Appeals administratively stayed the preliminary injunction order on April 16 to allow itself time to review the case and instructed the parties to file briefings on whether a longer stay pending the resolution of the appeal was necessary. A couple days later, the Court of Appeals froze the status quo by staying the portion of the preliminary injunction order requiring disbursement, while denying a stay with respect to the part of the order that required Citibank to hold the money and not return it to the government.</p>\r\n<p>Oral argument was held on May 19, 2025. On June 6, 2025, EPA filed a letter with the court expressing concern that plaintiffs interpreted the stay as set to dissolve automatically upon the appellate decision. EPA requested clarification or extension of the stay to avoid irreversible disbursement of funds pending further proceedings. (On June 9, the court denied a pro se motion to intervene. On July 8, the rejected movant filed a pro se petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court.)</p>\r\n<p>On September 2, 2025, in an opinion by Judge Rao, a divided court of appeals found that the district court abused its discretion in issuing a preliminary injunction. The court of appeals determined that plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits because the constitutional claim was meritless, and the regulatory and arbitrary-and-capricious claims were essentially contractual and therefore fell within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. Moreover, the court of appeals found that the balance of the equities strongly favored the government given its oversight of billions of dollars. Accordingly, the court of appeals vacated the injunction, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. 2025 WL 2502881.</p>",

The dispute was about the National Clean Investment Fund, set up by the Inflation Reduction Act’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. In April 2024, Climate United received $6.97 billion to fund clean energy projects, especially in low-income, rural, and tribal areas. The money was kept at Citibank under an Account Control Agreement with the EPA.\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 2025, Climate United Fund sued Citibank, the EPA, and the EPA Administrator in federal court. Climate United sought injunctive and declaratory relief, claiming that defendants unlawfully blocked access to grant funds already awarded and given out. It alleged Citibank breached its contract by refusing to disburse funds and that the EPA suspended the grant without proper legal process, violating federal law and the U.S. Constitution. Climate United sought a court order to unfreeze the funds. The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. \r\n\r\nOn March 10, Climate United sought a temporary restraining order (TRO) to require Citibank to fulfill its contract and prevent EPA interference. Citibank and EPA opposed, stating Citibank followed government instructions and that the grant was terminated March 11, 2025, ending plaintiffs' right to disbursements. \r\n\r\nOn March 18, Judge Chutkan granted in part and denied in part the TRO, enjoining defendants from effectuating the termination letter or transferring funds to anyone but account holders. On March 25, Judge Chutkan consolidated this case with related cases, designating it as the lead.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 2025, Climate United then moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent EPA from enforcing grant terminations or restricting access to funds and to block Citibank from moving funds. On April 15, Judge Chutkan granted this, ordering defendants not to effectuate the termination letter and to disburse funds. The government moved for a stay, arguing disbursement of taxpayer funds would be unrecoverable if reversed. The district court denied the stay.\r\n\r\nDefendants appealed, and the Court of Appeals stayed the portion of the injunction requiring disbursement but upheld provisions requiring Citibank to hold funds. \r\n\r\nOn September 2, 2025, a divided court of appeals found the district court abused its discretion by issuing the preliminary injunction, concluding Climate United was unlikely to succeed on the merits and vacated the injunction. The case was remanded to the district court for further proceedings. 2025 WL 2502881.",

Like the grant recipients (Grantees),1 Subgrantees attempt to shoehorn contract \nclaims into the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  But Subgrantees have an even worse case \nfor jurisdiction given that Congress has never waived sovereign immunity for contract claims by \nsubgrantees lacking any legal relationship with the government.  Subgrantees’ motion should \ntherefore be denied.   \nAlthough Subgrantees seek to rely upon the APA as a source for this Court’s jurisdiction, \nthey lack standing to sue under that statute.  In fact, the regulations they seek to rely upon \nexpressly provide that subrecipients have no legal relationship with the Environmental Protection \nAgency (EPA). 2 C.F.R. § 200.331; EPA Amended Grants Policy Issuance (GPI) 16-01 EPA \nSubaward Policy, October 1, 2024, (EPA Subaward Policy) at § 5.0(a).2   \nMoreover, sovereign immunity precludes this Court’s jurisdiction over Subgrantees’ \nclaims.  Subgrantees’ only source of rights are the rights in their agreements with their prime \ngrantee, Coalition for Green Capital (CGC).  Neither the APA nor the Tucker Act waive \nsovereign immunity for claims brought by subrecipients to enforce government awards to which \nthey are not a party.  This Court thus lacks jurisdiction to grant preliminary relief with respect to \nSubgrantees’ claims.   \n \n1 Grantees are Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, Inc., and Climate \nUnited Fund.  They each filed separate lawsuits, which the Court consolidated with the instant \nsuit. \n \n2 https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2020-11/documents/gpi-16-01-subaward-\npolicy_attachments.pdf.  \n \n  Page 1 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 10 of 31\n     \n \nDistinct from the jurisdictional flaws, Subgrantees also cannot show that they are likely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims.  EPA’s termination of the CGC grant agreement did not \nviolate the Inflation Reduction Act or the Constitution, nor did that termination violate any \nfederal grant regulation.  Subgrantees also cannot demonstrate that the EPA acted arbitrarily or \ncapriciously in terminating CGC’s grant agreement. \nFinally, the Subgrantees’ alleged harm is neither imminent nor irreparable.  Their alleged \nlosses are all speculative, economic, or both.  And any access to funding—which only became \navailable to them two months ago—depends on the actions of CGC, which, by statute, must have \nother sources of funds that it may use to pay subgrantees.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(1)(C).  Even \nif CGC halts funding, the grant funding can be restored if CGC or Subgrantees ultimately prevail \non the merits of their claims.  The public interest will not be served by forcing EPA to continue \nperformance under agreements that EPA has determined are not in the best of EPA’s \nimplementation of and oversight over the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, and do not advance \nagency policies and priorities. \nBACKGROUND \nEPA incorporates the background of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) \nprogram described in detail in its opposition to the Grantee’s motion, Climate United Fund, ECF \nNo. 49, USA Opp.,3 and adds the following:  \nIn August 2024, EPA awarded a $5 billion National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) grant \nto Coalition for Green Capital (CGC grant agreement).  The CGC grant agreement included \nspecific terms and conditions, incorporated various provisions of the Uniform Grant Guidance, 2 \n \n3 References to documents filed under the lead case will refer to Climate United Fund followed \nby their ECF numbers; references to documents filed under the Subgrantees’ case will refer to \nCIEDB followed by their ECF numbers.   \n  Page 2 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 11 of 31\n     \n \nC.F.R. §§ 200.339, 340 and 341, and was subject to EPA’s General Terms and Conditions.  See \nCIEDB, ECF No. 17-3, CGC grant agreement, Ex. A.  \nThe CGC grant agreement allowed CGC, as the “Recipient” of the $5 billion award, to \nmake subawards to state and local banks, among other organizations.  See generally id.  The \n“terms and conditions of Federal awards flow[ed] down to Subawards unless a particular section \nof 2 CFR § 200.101 or the terms and conditions of the Federal award specifically indicate[d] \notherwise.”  Id. at 50.  As provided in the CGC grant agreement, “Subrecipients” were “distinct” \nfrom “Program Beneficiar[ies]” and “accountable to the Recipient for proper use of EPA \nfunding.”  Id. at 11, 13.  The EPA’s Subaward Policy, referenced in the CGC grant agreement, \nmade clear that “EPA does not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients.”4   \nThe CGC grant agreement authorized the employment of a designated financial agent to \nhold the entire $5 billion award and to administer program distributions.  See CIEDB, ECF No. \n17-3, Ex. A, CGC grant agreement, at 50-51.  In September 2024, defendant Citibank was \nselected to that role under a Financial Agent Agreement with the U.S. Treasury.  See Climate \nUnited Fund, ECF No. 14, Ex. 1 (filed under seal) (FAA).  Although EPA was not a party to the \nFAA, the agency had authority to issue account controls with respect to the prime grantees in \naddition to the rights retained by Treasury to issue instructions to Citibank.  Climate United \nFund, ECF No. 25-1, Declaration of Eric Amidon, ¶ 23.  The FAA was binding only on “the \nparties to th[e] FAA,” and “[n]o other person or entity [had] any right or obligation hereunder, \n \n4 EPA Subaward Policy at § 5.0(a), see supra note 2.  This language mirrors the regulation \nspecific to subrecipient awards in the Uniform Guidance.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.331 (effective Oct. \n1, 2025). \n \n  Page 3 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 12 of 31\n     \n \nexcept for successor financial agents accepted by Treasury.”  Climate United Fund, ECF No. 14, \nFAA, at 15 (§ 30.E).  \nSubgrantees are four subrecipients selected by CGC under the terms of the CGC grant \nagreement.  See CIEDB, ECF No. 1 (Complaint), ¶ 4.  They do not have agreements with EPA.  \nSee CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 17 (“Indeed, Plaintiffs as subgrantees are not even party to \nany contract to which EPA is also a party.”).  Rather, they have Subaward Agreements with prime \ngrant recipient CGC, see id. ¶ 4, and Account Control Agreements with defendant Citibank \n(ACAs), see id. ¶ 33.  All Subgrantee ACAs were executed on or after January 20, 2025.  See \nCIEDB ECF Nos. 17-1, Ex. A (Illinois Finance Authority ACA), 17-2, Ex. A (Efficiency Maine \nTrust ACA), 17-4, Ex. A (Minnesota Climate Innovation Finance Authority ACA), and 17-5, Ex. \n1 (California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank ACA).   \nSubgrantees allege that, following EPA’s termination of the CGC grant agreement, they \ncould no longer access NCIF funding in their accounts.  See CIEDB, ECF 1, Compl. ¶¶ 43-46 \n(alleging that IBank’s request for $415,314 in NCIF funding was not fulfilled); id. ¶¶ 50-51 \n(alleging that Efficiency Maine’s requests for a transfer of $10 million and a transfer of $17,807 \nwere not fulfilled, and that it “continues to be unable to access the more than $25 million in \nfunds held in its Citibank account”); see CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 24 (describing “the \ndelay” on MnCIFA’s “ability to draw on the NCIF funds”); id., ECF No. 17-1, ¶ 13 (describing \nIFA’s inability to draw down on the $108 million subaward from CGC).  To remedy these alleged \nharms, Subgrantees seek to compel EPA’s performance under the CGC grant agreement and its \nadherence to the FAA.  See CIEDB, ECF No. 1, Compl. at 53-54. \n \n \n  Page 4 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 13 of 31\n     \n \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nSubgrantees filed suit on March 19, 2025.  See Cal. Infra. and Econ. Devel. Bank, et al. \nvs. Citibank, N.A., et al., Case. No. 25-cv-820 (D.D.C.), ECF No. 1.  The Court consolidated the \nsuit with those of the Grantees and set the deadlines for briefing on the Subgrantees’ motion for \npreliminary injunction, with argument scheduled for April 2, 2025.  The Court further instructed \nthe parties to file all papers in the lead case, Climate United Fund, Case No. 1:25-cv-698.  \nSubgrantees filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on March 24, 2024.  See CIEDB, PI \nMot., ECF No. 17.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“The standard for issuance of the ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ of a temporary \nrestraining order or a preliminary injunction is very high, and by now very well established.”  \nC.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 197 (D.D.C. 2020).  A movant seeking such an \nextraordinary remedy “bears the burden of making a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such \nrelief.”  Id.  To make such a showing, Subgrantees bear the burden of establishing (1) they are \nlikely to “succeed on the merits,” (2) they are “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief,” (3) “the balance of the equities tips in [their] favor,” and (4) “an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Id.   \nARGUMENT5 \nI.  This Court Lacks Jurisdiction to Hear Subgrantees’ Claims. \nSubgrantees lack standing to challenge the termination of a government agreement to \nwhich they are not parties.  Their motion for preliminary relief should be denied, and their \n \n5 As set out in the parties’ Joint Status Report, CIEDB, ECF No. 10, and approved by the Court’s \nMarch 25, 2025 Minute Order, Subgrantees agreed in their motion for a preliminary injunction to \n“make best efforts to avoid briefing issues that are duplicative of the [Grantee] Plaintiffs’ \n \n  Page 5 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 14 of 31\n     \n \ncomplaint against EPA should be dismissed, on that ground alone.  Moreover, this Court lacks \njurisdiction to adjudicate Subgrantees’ claims under the APA because the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity does not allow suits for “monetary damages” or for relief expressly or \nimpliedly forbidden by another statute.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  And the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § \n1491(a), forbids subrecipients from suing the United States for specific performance of prime \ngrants. \nA.  Subgrantees Lack Standing to Bring Their Claims. \n The subgrantees lack standing because they have no legally protected right to grant \nfunding that can be enforced against EPA.  “The Constitution limits the exercise of judicial \npower to ‘cases’ and ‘controversies.’” Aetna Life Ins. Co. of Hartford, Conn., v. Haworth, 300 \nU.S. 227, 239 (1937) (citing U.S. Const. art. III, § 2).  For a “case or controversy” to exist, a \nlitigant must have standing to bring the claim.  Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n(1992).  To prevail on the threshold issue of standing, the plaintiff must show (1) an injury-in-\nfact, (2) traceability, and (3) a likelihood that the injury is redressable by the court.  Id. at 560-\n561. “The party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these elements.”  \nId. at 561.   \nSubgrantees cannot meet this burden.  To satisfy the first element of Article III standing, \nSubgrantees must show an invasion of a legally protected interest.  Lujan, 504 U.S at 560 \n(internal quotations and citations removed).  And Subgrantees, as subrecipients of a Federal \n \nsubmissions of March 21, 2025” and the government agreed that its “response will be limited to \nthe arguments raised in the [Subgrantees’] submissions, and [the government] will not use this \nopposition to the [Subgrantees’] motion to respond to or otherwise sur-reply to arguments made \nin the [Grantee] Plaintiffs’ reply.”  Therefore, this opposition incorporates all relevant portions of \nthe government’s opposition to the Grantees’ motion, Climate United, ECF No. 49.    \n  Page 6 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 15 of 31\n     \n \naward, cannot demonstrate “a legally protected interest.”  Sardarian v. Fed. Emergency Mgmt. \nAgency, No. 3:19-CV-00910 (OAW), 2022 WL 4080325, at *1–2 (D. Conn. Apr. 1, 2022). \nIn Sardarian, the plaintiff filed suit against FEMA and local and state agencies, alleging \nthat “his grant” under FEMA’s Hazard Mitigation Program “was unjustifiably terminated,” and \nFEMA “misled him about his grant award limit,” and his home “[was] under threat of constant \nflooding.” Id. at *2 (emphasis in original).  The court dismissed the suit for lack of standing, \nholding that the plaintiff did not have a “legally protected interest” under Lujan, because FEMA \nawarded “the grant in question” to the State of Connecticut and to the Town of Westport, and \nplaintiff was not the recipient of the Federal grant “for purposes of establishing jurisdiction.”  Id. \n  Here, Subgrantees are not parties to the grant that was terminated.  Rather, they are \n“subrecipients,” who “receive[d] a subaward from a pass-through entity, to carry out part of a \nFederal award.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  Subgrantees’ status is undisputed.  Compl. ¶ 33; see PI Mot. \nat 9 (“Plaintiffs are subrecipients under CGC’s NCIF grant.”).  EPA’s Subaward Policy and the \nrevised Uniform Guidance, effective October 1, 2024, clarified that Federal awarding agencies \n“do[] not have a direct legal relationship with subrecipients or contractors of any tier.”  See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.331.   Because Subgrantees cannot show that they were “recipient[s] of a [Federal] \naward,” see Sardarian, 2022 WL 4080325, at *1, and do not have any direct legal relationship \nwith the EPA, they do not have a “legally protected interest.”  Id.  Rather than recognize the \nlimitations inherent in their status, Subgrantees brazenly attempt to couch their lack of rights as \nsome separate positive source of rights.  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 17.  (“Indeed, Plaintiffs \nas subgrantees are not even party to any contract to which EPA is also a party.”).  That contention \nsubverts the limitations Congress defined when it enacted the APA, and it is a clear attempt to \ncircumvent Article III’s standing requirements.  See TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, \n  Page 7 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 16 of 31\n     \n \n424-30 (2021) (recognizing that an alleged statutory violation does not automatically confer \nArticle III standing). \nThe Subgrantees also lack prudential standing as subrecipients to Federal agreements \nbecause any rights against the government belong to the grantees.  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, \n499–500 (1975) (“[E]ven when the plaintiff has alleged injury sufficient to meet the ‘case or \ncontroversy’ requirement, . . . the plaintiff generally must assert his own legal rights and \ninterests, and cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights or interests of third parties.”) \n(citing cases).  The lack of prudential standing here is consistent with the Tucker Act’s denial of \nstanding to a subrecipient, or any other party not in privity with the government.  “A plaintiff \nmust be in privity with the United States to have standing to sue the sovereign on a contract \nclaim.” Sullivan v. United States, 625 F.3d 1378, 1379–80 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (citing Anderson v. \nUnited States, 344 F.3d 1343, 1351 (Fed.Cir.2003)).  “Not only is privity a fundamental \nrequirement of contract law, but it is particularly important in cases involving government \ncontracts because the ‘government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of \ncontract.’” Id. (quoting Erickson Air Crane Co. of Wash. v. United States, 731 F.2d 810, 813 \n(Fed.Cir.1984)).   \nB.  Sovereign Immunity Bars this Court from Adjudicating Subgrantees’ Claims.    \nThe federal government is generally “immune from suit in federal court absent a clear \nand unequivocal waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th \n1099, 1105 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  And although the APA provides “a limited waiver of sovereign \nimmunity for claims against the United States” seeking non-monetary relief, id., that waiver does \nnot apply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief \nwhich is sought,” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. \n209, 215 (2012). \n  Page 8 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 17 of 31\n     \n \nHere, neither the APA nor the Tucker Act waive the federal government’s sovereign \nimmunity with respect to the Subgrantees’ claims.  With respect to the APA, a claimant must seek \n“relief other than money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The Supreme Court long ago recognized \nthat subcontractors cannot turn to the APA for jurisdiction in an effort to recover funds owed \nunder a prime agreement.  Dep’t of Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 263 (1999).  In Blue \nFox, a prime contractor failed to pay a subcontractor (Blue Fox) for a construction project \ncompleted for the Department of the Army.  Id. at 256-57.  Predicating jurisdiction on 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331 and the APA—as Subgrantees do here—Blue Fox sought an “equitable lien” on any \nArmy funds not yet paid under the prime contract, or any funds available or appropriated for \ncompletion of the construction project, and an order directing the Army to pay those funds.  Id. at \n258.  The Supreme Court rejected Blue Fox’s arguments for APA jurisdiction, reasoning: \n[T]he sort of equitable lien sought by respondent here constitutes a claim for \n“money damages”; its goal is to seize or attach money in the hands of the \nGovernment as compensation for the loss resulting from the default of the prime \ncontractor. As a form of substitute and not specific relief, respondent’s action to \nenforce an equitable lien falls outside of § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity. \nId. at 263.  The Supreme Court emphasized that “unless waived by Congress, sovereign \nimmunity bars subcontractors and other creditors from enforcing liens on Government property \nor funds to recoup their losses.”  Id. at 265.  Blue Fox thus demonstrates that subrecipients, like \nSubgrantees, are bound by the limitations that the Tucker Act imposes upon the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity.  Like Blue Fox, Subgrantees have no privity with EPA, as they themselves \nacknowledge.  And Subgrantees seek to retain funds from a terminated grant—opportunistic \nlabels aside, that is a demand for money damages.  The relief Subgrantees demand thus “falls \noutside of § 702’s waiver of sovereign immunity.”  Blue Fox, 525 U.S. at 263.  And Subgrantees \nhave no right to enforce CGC’s contract against the United States.  See Erickson Air Crane, 731 \n  Page 9 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 18 of 31\n     \n \nF.2d at 813 (“The government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of \ncontract, which it does not have with subcontractors.”).    \nAdditionally, Subgrantees seek relief that both the APA and Tucker Act forbid.  The APA \nprovides, again, that “[n]othing herein . . . confers authority to grant relief if any other statute that \ngrants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  Id.  The Tucker \nAct “forbids the relief” that Subgrantees seek, that is, specific performance of the CGC grant \nagreement and continued access to the funding the prime agreement provides.  See Sharp v. \nWeinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523-24 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“The waiver of sovereign immunity in the \n[APA] does not run to actions seeking . . . specific performance in contract cases, because . . . the \nTucker Act and Little Tucker Act impliedly forbid such relief.”) (citations omitted).  The Tucker \nAct also forbids the court “to hear a claim brought directly against the federal government by a \nsubcontractor.”  G4S Tech. LLC v. United States, 114 Fed. Cl. 662, 669 (2014), aff'd, 779 F.3d \n1337 (Fed. Cir. 2015) (citing United States v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 713 F.2d 1541, 1550 (Fed. \nCir. 1983)). \nEven if this Court were to find that Subgrantees have a legal right to enforce CGC’s \ncontract, it would still lack jurisdiction to grant Subgrantees relief.  Like the Grantees’ claims, \nSubgrantees’ claims are founded upon a contract, as they seek to undo termination of the CGC \nprime agreement, alleging EPA’s termination was improper.  See, e.g., CIEDB, ECF No. 1, \nCompl. ¶¶ 95, 105 (alleging, in support of Counts 1 and 2, “[d]efendants have taken official \naction purporting to terminate the [GGRF] grants to the prime recipients, which were intended \nto implement the NCIF”); CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Motion at 21 (“The terms and conditions for \nthe NCIF award to CGC (the award for which [Subgrantees] are subawardees) contain no \nprovision for termination based on agency priorities . . . .) (emphasis added); id. at 53-54 \n  Page 10 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 19 of 31\n     \n \n(seeking to “vacate the purported termination” of the CGC grant agreement and to require EPA’s \nadherence to “the terms of the Financial Agency Agreement”).  Under the Tucker Act, only the \nCourt of Federal Claims has jurisdiction “to render judgment upon any claim against the United \nStates founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States . . . .”  Thus, any \nlegal right Subgrantees may have with respect to their contract claims must be litigated in the \nCourt of Federal Claims.   \nThe D.C. Circuit just denied injunctive relief pending appeal on nearly identical facts in \nUnited States Conference of Catholic Bishops v. U.S. Department of State, App. No. 25-5066 \n(D.C. Cir.  Mar. 28, 2025).  Like this case, the plaintiff in Catholic Bishops initially sought an \ninjunction in district court to prevent the United States Department of State from “pausing or \ncanceling contracts.” Catholic Bishops, No. 25-cv-465, 2025 WL 763738, at *1 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, \n2025).  Also like this case, the grant funding at issue was terminated before the preliminary \ninjunction hearing.  Id. at *2.  The government argued that the district court lacked jurisdiction \nunder the APA—just as EPA argues here.  And crucially, the plaintiff in Catholic Bishops argued \nthat the government violated the very same termination regulation that this lawsuit is built on, 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340.  Id. at *3; see also Appellee’s Mot. for Injunction at pp. 23, App. No. 25-5066 \n(Mar 14, 2025) (Doc. No. 2105901).  Despite this termination regulation, the district court \nrefused to consider the merits of termination.  Id. at *7, 8.  As the district court explained, “the \nagency action that [plaintiff] ask[ed] the Court to reverse [wa]s the Government’s decision to \ncease a financial relationship with the [plaintiff].”  Id. at *7.  Despite plaintiff’s “creative \ndrafting,” the district court concluded that relief must be pursued under the Tucker Act, not the \nAPA.  Id.  The plaintiff then moved the D.C. Circuit for an injunction pending appeal, raising the \nsame arguments Grantees and Subgrantees advance here.  In a per curium order, the D.C. Circuit \n  Page 11 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 20 of 31\n     \n \ndenied relief.  See Catholic Bishops, App. No. 25-5066 (D.C. Cir.  Mar. 28, 2025).  The same \nresult should apply here, on nearly identical facts.  \nC.  Subgrantees, Like Grantees, Cannot Challenge Funding Decisions Committed \nto Agency Discretion.  \nSubgrantees also improperly challenge funding decisions that are committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  When “a statute is drawn so that a court would have no \nmeaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion,” Heckler v. \nChaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985), review under the APA is unavailable because there is no \nwaiver of sovereign immunity where agency action requires “complicated balancing of a number \nof factors which are peculiarly within [agency’s] expertise.”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 \n(1993) (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831-32); see also Climate United Fund, ECF No. 49, USA \nOpp. at 16-17.   \nHere, Congress entrusted EPA “to make grants, on a competitive basis” for distinct \npurposes, 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a), and left it to EPA to design its programs, provide appropriate \noversight and control, and “carry out other greenhouse gas emission reduction activities, as \ndetermined appropriate by the Administrator.”  See id. § 7434(a)(1) (emphasis added).  EPA’s \ndetermination that the current structure of Grantees’ agreements does not afford the agency \nnecessary oversight and account controls is a matter uniquely within EPA’s expertise and a \nmatter committed to its discretion.  See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192.  Because Congress gave EPA \n“the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it \nsees as the most effective or desirable way,” id. at 192, Subgrantees are unlikely to succeed on \ntheir effort to intrude upon the agency’s exercise of discretion.  \n  Page 12 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 21 of 31\n     \n \nII.  Subgrantees are Unlikely to Succeed on the Merits of their APA Claims. \nAs explained, Subgrantees’ claims are nearly identical to those of Grantees.  Compare \nCIDEB, ECF No. 17, at 18-21 (Subgrantees’ PI Motion) with Climate United Fund, ECF No. 33-\n1, at 27-41 (Grantees’ PI Motion).  In accord with the parties’ representations to the Court that \nthey would minimize duplicative briefing, EPA incorporates the arguments in its opposition to \nGrantees’ motion, see Climate United Fund, ECF No. 49, USA Opp. at 21-26, and further \nemphasizes the following: \n1.  The Court should reject Subgrantees’ broad arguments invoking “separation of \npowers,” which are unmoored to any right of action.  First, the Subgrantees have no standing and \nidentify no waiver of sovereign immunity that would allow them to assert any stand-alone \nseparation of powers claim.  And EPA’s termination of the CGC grant agreement did not violate \nany provision of the Inflation Reduction Act, nor did it usurp Congress’s “power of the purse” or \n“violate the separation of powers.”  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 18-19.   \nAs relevant here, “when the President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization \nof Congress, his authority is at its maximum, for it includes all that he possesses in his own right \nplus all that Congress can delegate.”  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, 576 U.S. 1, 10 \n(2015).  In the instant case, Congress authorized EPA to make grant awards and left the design, \nimplementation, and administration of those grants to EPA’s discretion, see 42 U.S.C. § \n7434(a)(1)-(2).   \nPlainly, Congress knows how to write laws that constrain Executive Branch discretion, \nand it did not do so here.  “Congress knows how to impose mandatory provisions in contracts.”  \nAm. Tel. and Tel. Co. v. United States, 124 F.3d 1471, 1478 (Fed. Cir. 1997), aff’d, 307 F.3d 1374 \n(Fed. Cir. 2002).  And“[w]here Congress knows how to say something but chooses not to, its \nsilence is controlling.”  Brendsel v. Off. of Fed. Hous. Enter. Oversight, 339 F. Supp. 2d 52, 65 \n  Page 13 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 22 of 31\n     \n \n(D.D.C. 2004) (quoting In re Griffith, 206 F.3d 1389, 1394 (11th Cir. 2000)).  Moreover, the \njudiciary will “assume that Congress is aware of existing law when it passes legislation.”  Miles \nv. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990).  Congress passed, and the President signed, the \nInflation Reduction Act on August 16, 2022.  In doing so, it directed EPA to make use of GGRF’s \nfunding by using the contractual vehicle of a grant process.  That congressional direction has \nconsequences for the parties that Subgrantees simply wish to ignore. \nThe Executive Branch, just like any other party to a contract, maintains an unqualified \nright to breach that contract for any reason.  See Climate United Fund, ECF No. 49, USA Opp. at \n13-14.  Congress is charged to know this law.  Miles, 498 U.S. at 32; Mobil Oil Expl. and \nProducing Se. v. United States, 530 U.S. 604, 607 (2000).  Here, Congress empowered EPA with \nthe discretion to manage the grant program, defining only the amount of money appropriated, a \ndeadline for award of the appropriation, and broad policy objectives.  42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)-(2).  \nNothing in the statute suggests that Congress denied EPA the standard contract right to cease \nperforming an initially awarded agreement and potentially face contract remedies if a \ncounterparty can demonstrate EPA’s administration of the program breached the grant \nagreements.  There is simply no cogent separation of powers argument in Subgrantees’ favor.  \nIndeed, the opposite is true—by asking this Court to hold the EPA to specific performance, the \nSubgrantees invite intrusion into the constitutional discretion vested in the Executive Branch and \nthe power of the purse vested in the House of Representatives by the Appropriations Clause. \n2.  EPA’s termination was also not contrary to the Uniform Grant Guidance in 2 C.F.R. \nPart 200.  Although § 200.340 provides bases for termination and obligates an agency to include \nthose bases in grant agreements, the regulation does not mandate what grant termination \n  Page 14 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 23 of 31\n     \n \nprovisions must or must not say, or limit an agency’s ability to terminate a grant to those bases \nlisted in the grant agreement.  See Climate United Fund, ECF No. 49, USA Opp. at 25-26.   \nIII.  Subgrantees’ Alleged Economic Harms Are Neither Imminent Nor Irreparable. \nSubgrantees alleged two categories of harm—lost business and reputational harm—and \nboth fail to support the extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction in this case.  The first \ncategory, “imminent loss of business,” fails because the alleged harm is financial, not irreparable, \nand because the alleged potential loss of qualified projects is not certain.  Subgrantees recognize \nthat they will continue to operate while they await a ruling on the merits, and that both they and \nCGC have access to other sources of funding, as required for each “eligible recipient” for an \naward.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(1)(C).  At any rate, any “loss” of potentially qualified projects is \npurely speculative because Subgrantees admit that they have not yet vetted identified projects. \nSimilarly, the alleged risk that EPA will “claw back” Subgrantees’ subaward funds is equally \nspeculative. \nThe second category, reputational harms, fails because the alleged harms are financial, \nare not certain, and would not be remedied by an injunction.  Subgrantees acknowledge that \nEPA’s termination letter did not mention any wrongdoing by subgrantees.  And even if \nSubgrantees could demonstrate some reputational harm, they offer no reason that a preliminary \ninjunction would remedy it.  \nA.  Subgrantees’ Alleged Imminent Loss is Financial and Uncertain. \nThe D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  “Where the injuries alleged \nare purely financial or economic, the barrier to proving irreparable injury is higher still, for it is \n‘well settled that economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.’”  \nMexichem Spec. Resins, Inc. v. E.P.A., 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Wisc. Gas \n  Page 15 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 24 of 31\n     \n \nCo. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  “The Supreme Court has echoed this \nmessage, finding that ‘the temporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually \nconstitute irreparable injury.’”  Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1295 (D.C. \nCir. 2009) (citing Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974)). \nSubgrantees may continue to operate during the pendency of this lawsuit.  In terminating \nCGC’s grants, EPA has not prohibited or made it unlawful for Subgrantees to carry out their \nwork.  Nor has any other government action.  The government is not preventing Subgrantees \nfrom providing services; EPA has just terminated the grant agreements under which the \ngovernment would provide reimbursement for services to prime grantee CGC, which, in turn, \nwill make its own decision about whether and how to reimburse Subgrantees.  See, e.g., Faculty \nSenate of Fla. Int’l Univ. v. Winn, 477 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1208 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (“There is no \nirreparable harm here because the plaintiffs can fund the desired travel themselves and then, if \nthey prevail in this suit, obtain reimbursement. In other words, the harm is financial.”).  The only \nharm to Subgrantees is financial, based on a lack of funding for CGC as the prime grantee, which \nis insufficient for injunctive relief. \nSubgrantees’ alleged harm—delayed disbursement of funds—would be remedied at the \nconclusion of a lawsuit, if their claims are meritorious.  And the inability to collect money unless \nand until a plaintiff prevails on the merits is a standard part of litigation that does not justify a \npreliminary injunction.  “The rule that equitable remedies cannot issue when the damages are \nmonetary in nature has been ingrained in law for ‘half a millennium or so,’ and no judge within \nthe English common law tradition has the luxury of ignoring it.”  United States v. Michigan, 230 \nF.R.D. 492, 495 n.1 (E.D. Mich. 2005); see also Dennis Melancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, \n703 F.3d 262, 279 (5th Cir. 2012) (the “possibility that adequate compensatory or other \n  Page 16 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 25 of 31\n     \n \ncorrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation, [weighs] \nheavily against a claim of irreparable harm”) (citation omitted). \nAlthough harms from waiting for money are insufficient to justify a preliminary \ninjunction, Subgrantees cannot even claim those insufficient harms.  See Michigan, 230 F.R.D. at \n495 (movant failed to show irreparable harm beyond monetary damages even though “[movant] \nargue[d] that its ratepayers are low-income and do not have the luxury of saying, ‘It’s only \nmoney.’”).  Efficiency Maine Trust recognizes that it has significant other capital available even \naside from that available through CGC, claiming only that capital available for revolving loan \nfunds would be exhausted in the next 12 months.  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 25.  MnCIFA \nrecognizes that its operating expenses are covered by State grants and that its lending will \ncontinue, albeit at a “slow[er]” pace. Id. \nAnd Subgrantees’ alleged “risks” of losing business from qualified projects fail to justify \na preliminary injunction because they are not “certain.”  An irreparable harm “must be ‘both \ncertain and great, actual and not theoretical.’” Church v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. \n2021) (quoting Mexichem, 787 F.3d at 555).  Subgrantees’ brief and declarations are full of \nspeculative language, pointing the Court to harms that “may”—but have not and might not—\noccur.  Subgrantees admit that they have not committed to fund the identified projects and have \nnot even completed any due diligence or obtained credit approvals.  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot \nat 23.  The potential loss of a potential opportunity is insufficient.  See Save Jobs USA v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 105 F. Supp. 3d 108, 113 (D.D.C. 2015) (denying preliminary \ninjunction of rule that would allow H-4 visa holders to apply for jobs because plaintiff did not \nprovide evidence the visa holders would compete with plaintiff’s members).  Subgrantees have \nnot provided evidence that they would have extended loans to identified potential recipients.  \n  Page 17 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 26 of 31\n     \n \nNor have they demonstrated that they cannot secure similar business opportunities after a ruling \non the merits. \nAnd the risk that EPA might “claw back” and re-obligate funds, thus making them un-\navailable to the current grantees is also not imminent harm.  See CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at \n28.  In issuing a TRO in favor of Grantees, this Court stated that funds transferred out of \nCitibank would not be recoverable because “[i]n cases involving government expenditures, ‘once \nthe relevant funds have been obligated, a court cannot reach them in order to award relief.’” \nClimate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-CV-698, 2025 WL 842360, at *9 (D.D.C. Mar. \n18, 2025) (quoting City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426–27 (D.C. \nCir. 1994)).  But an irreparable harm must be “‘of such imminence that there is a clear and \npresent need for equitable relief.’” Church, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 138 (quoting Mexichem, 787 F.3d \nat 555).  “Speculative injury does not constitute irreparable injury sufficient to warrant granting a \npreliminary injunction.  A plaintiff must do more than merely allege imminent harm sufficient to \nestablish standing; a plaintiff must demonstrate immediate threatened injury as a prerequisite to \npreliminary injunctive relief.”  Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th \nCir. 1988) (citations omitted).  Subgrantees cannot meet this standard because any assertions \nabout the alleged imminence of EPA’s alleged claw back and re-obligation are purely \nspeculative.  Cf. Wise v. United States, 128 F. Supp. 3d 311, 320 (D.D.C. 2015) (denying \npreliminary injunction against foreclosure sale because plaintiffs did not face “immediate” sale \nof their property where foreclosure process was ongoing).  \nB.  Subgrantees’ Alleged Reputational Harms Are Financial, Uncertain, and \nWould Not be Remedied by an Injunction. \nFaced with the reality that their tenuous claims of economic harm cannot justify the \nextraordinary remedy of preliminary injunction, Subgrantees turn to manufacturing reputational \n  Page 18 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 27 of 31\n     \n \nharms, which “can be used to establish irreparable harm in certain circumstances.”  Trudeau v. \nFed. Trade Com’n, 384 F. Supp. 2d 281, 297 (D.D.C. 2005) (citation omitted).  Those \ncircumstances are not present here.  Indeed, harms that “can be redressed through monetary \ncompensation” are “by definition not irreparable.”  Guttenberg v. Emery, 26 F. Supp. 3d 88, 103 \n(D.D.C. 2014).  Subgrantees point to the following as “just a few examples of the specific \nreputational harms” they will “suffer”: limitation on their ability to apply or receive federal or \nstate grant funds, decrease in the amount of bonds they can issue, or increase on their borrowers’ \ninterest rates.  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. 27-28.  These harms are “‘strictly economic’ and \ntherefore not irreparable . . . [and] the discontinuance of funds did not injure [Plaintiffs’] \nreputation because it reflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy.”  Planned \nParenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Schweiker, 700 F.2d 710, 718 n.16 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (noting the \ndiscontinuance of title X funding was not sufficient to justify preliminary injunction).  Loss of \ngrant funding or increased interest rates, if any, resulting from changed circumstances, are all \neconomic losses and do not constitute irreparable harm that would warrant preliminary \ninjunction.  Ahuruonye v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 312 F. Supp. 3d 1, 24 (D.D.C. 2018), see also \nInt’l Ass’n of Machinists and Aerospace Workers v. Nat’l Mediation Bd., 374 F. Supp. 2d 135, \n142 (D.D.C. 2005) (holding that “financial loss can be remedied with money damages” and does \nnot constitute irreparable injury).  Subgrantees also fail to show that an increase in their interest \nrate is “certain.” \nSubgrantees’ alleged reputation harms also fail because they are speculative.  The D.C. \nCircuit rejected entry of a preliminary injunction “when [the alleged injuries are] nothing more \nthan speculation about how third parties might respond” to an agency’s statements and actions.  \nJohn Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  “As with \n  Page 19 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 28 of 31\n     \n \nall other forms of irreparable harm, the showing of reputational harm must be concrete and \ncorroborated, not merely speculative.”  Trudeau, 384 F. Supp. 2d at 297; see also Ahuruonye, \n312 F. Supp. 3d at 24 (quoting Trudeau).  On the one hand, Subgrantees argue that the \nTermination Letter “threatens additional severe reputational harms to [them] if given effect” \nbecause EPA “insinuated without outright stating in its letter that CGC—and by extension . . . \nsubawardees—have committed fraud, waste, and abuse and otherwise acted in a deficient \nmanner.”  Id. at 26-27.  But, on the other hand, Subgrantees acknowledge that EPA’s termination \nis fundamentally concerned with EPA’s ability to exercise oversight and control.  See CIEDB, \nECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 14-15.  Subgrantees do not explain how statements about “EPA’s past \nconduct, not CGC’s or its subgrantees’ actions” (see id. at 15) implicate the Subgrantees’ \nreputations, because they do not.   \nSubgrantees’ citation to Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 963 F. Supp. 1, \n5 (D.D.C. 1997) only undermines their argument.  In Patriot, the court found reputational harm \nbecause HUD promulgated a letter specifically addressing the plaintiff’s business practices.  Id.  \nThe Termination Letter [and other statements by EPA] did not address the Subgrantees, and \nfocused instead on “EPA’s past conduct.”  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. at 15.  Any effect on the \nSubgrantees’ reputation is speculative at best. \nFinally, Subgrantees cannot explain how a preliminary injunction would remedy the \n“cloud of uncertainty” surrounding future funding of the program.  CIEDB, ECF No. 17, PI Mot. \nat 23.  A plaintiff must prove “not just that [it] faces an irreparable harm, but that the injunction \nwould clearly avoid this injury.” Santini v. Farris, No. 2:21-cv-13045, 2022 WL 831420, at *3 \n(E.D. Mich. Feb. 15, 2022), report and recommendation adopted, No. 21-13045, 2022 WL \n831224 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 18, 2022) (citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n  Page 20 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 29 of 31\n     \n \n(2008)).  Even if the Court enters preliminary relief, that preliminary relief does not guarantee \nfinal relief, nor could it curtail EPA’s clearly stated intent to cancel these grant agreements.  Any \nentity that considers seeking NCIF funds from Subgrantees will know that that Subgrantees’ \naccess to grant funds is not guaranteed.  Because a preliminary injunction cannot remedy \nSubgrantees’ claimed harms, a preliminary injunction should not issue. \nIV.  An Injunction Would be Contrary to the Public Interest. \nThe balance of equities and public interest weigh against granting Subgrantees’ \npreliminary injunction.  See Climate United Fund, ECF No. 49, USA Opp. at 29-30.  The \ngovernment has a strong interest in safeguarding the public fisc.  See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 \nU.S. 319, 348 (1976).  And the government is unlikely to recover funds after Subgrantees spend \nthem.  The loss of likely unrecoverable funds is a classic injury to the government that should \npreclude preliminary relief. See Heckler v. Turner, 468 U.S. 1305, 1307-1308 (1984) (Rehnquist, \nJ., in chambers) (prospect of the government being forced to make $1.3 million in improper \npayments per month supported a stay of injunction).  For this reason, a preliminary injunction \nshould be denied.   \nV.  Any Injunction Should be Narrowly Tailored \nFor the reasons explained above, Subgrantees are not entitled to any preliminary injunctive \nrelief.  But in the event the Court concludes otherwise, injunctive relief “must be narrowly \ntailored to remedy the specific harm shown,” Neb. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., 435 F.3d 326, 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted), and “should be no \nmore burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” \nMadsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted).  The scope of \nany relief granted here should not extend beyond the Court’s TRO, see Climate United Fund, \nECF No. 28, which essentially “freezes” NCIF grant funds at Citibank, preventing EPA from \n  Page 21 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 30 of 31\n     \n \nasking Citibank to return the money to the government and preventing the three NCIF grantees \nfrom obtaining disbursement.  See Climate United Fund, ECF No. 31 at 2 (“In complying with \nthe Court’s directives that it ‘preserve the status quo,’ . . . Citibank will—absent further order \nfrom the Court—not give effect to EPA’s Termination Letter but will continue to comply with \nEPA’s and Treasury’s directives from March 10, 2025, that it ‘pause the processing of payment \ninstructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice.’”). \nThat the Court should limit any relief to continuing that freeze is especially warranted \nconsidering the significant risk that any monies disbursed to Subgrantees may not be \nrecoverable.  Any granted relief should also be (1) limited to the specific agency action \nSubgrantees’ challenge—the Termination Letter—not any other conduct whose lawfulness is not \nbefore this Court, see Nat’l Ass’n of Chain Drug Stores v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n631 F. Supp. 2d 17, 21 (D.D.C. 2009); and (2) limited to the specific Subgrantees who have \nshown imminent and irreparable harm, and to the specific extent of the demonstrated harm. \nVI.  Bond is Required if the Court Issues a Preliminary Injunction.  \nIf the Court decides to grant any preliminary injunctive relief, the Court should order \nsecurity with any preliminary injunction.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), the Court \nmay issue a preliminary injunction “only if the movant gives security” for “costs and damages \nsustained” by defendants if they are later found to “have been wrongfully enjoined.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(c).  Although this Rule provides “broad discretion in the district court to determine the \nappropriate amount of an injunction bond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. \n1999), when setting security, courts “should err on the high side” because setting a bond amount \ntoo low might produce injury since “the damages for an erroneous preliminary injunction cannot \nexceed the amount of the bond.”  Mead Johnson & Co. v. Abbott Labs., 201 F.3d 883, 888 (7th \nCir. 2000).  Should the Court issue an injunction at this preliminary stage that exceeds the scope \n  Page 22 of 23   \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 56     Filed 03/31/25     Page 31 of 31\n     \n \nof the temporary restraining order and allows Subgrantees to draw down on the Citibank \naccounts, the Court must require Subgrantees to post a bond.   \nCONCLUSION \nEPA respectfully requests that the Court deny Subgrantees’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. \nDated: March 31, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nYAAKOV ROTH  \nActing Assistant Attorney General  \n \nKIRK T.

A stay pending appeal would be necessary to preserve the \nstatus quo in this case.   \nBACKGROUND \nLess than two weeks ago, the Supreme Court considered the very questions at issue in \nthis case in U.S. Department of Education v. California, S. Ct. No. 24A910 (April 4, 2025).  Like \nthis case, the respondents in Dept. of Ed. contend that the government’s termination of their grant \nagreements did not comply with statutes and regulations, including the same termination \nregulation at issue here, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.  The district court also entered the same basic relief \nrequested here: an order enjoining the government from “terminating various education related \n \n1 This number reflects the amount of funding requested by grantees and subgrantees in both the \nNCIF and CCIA programs.  The NCIF program alone constitutes $447 million of that total.  \n2 Grantees are Coalition for Green Capital (CGC), Power Forward Communities, Inc. (PFC), and \nClimate United Fund.  CGC subgrantees also filed suit, California Infrastructure and Economic \nDevelopment Bank, et al., v. Citibank, N.A., et al., Case No. 1:25-cv-00820 (TSC). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 5 of 12\ngrants” and “to pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they \naccrue.”  Dept. of Ed., Order at 1.   \nThe Supreme Court stayed injunctive relief, concluding that “the Government is likely to \nsucceed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order payment of money under the \nAPA.”  Id. at 1–2.  The Supreme Court explained, “as we have recognized, the APA’s limited \nwaiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ \nalong the lines of what the District Court ordered here.’” Id. at 2 (quoting Great-West Life & \nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. 204, 212 (2002)).  The Supreme Court also recognized \nthere, as here, that the government is unlikely to recover grant funds once they are disbursed.  \nCourts have begun applying the Supreme Court’s direction in grant termination cases filed \nimprovidently in district court.  See Mass. Fair Hous. Ctr et. al. v. Dept. of Hous. and Urban \nDev., et. al., 3:25-cv-30041 (D. Mass.) (April 14, 2025 Minute Order).  \nAlthough Plaintiffs attempted to distinguish their case from Dept. of Ed. based on the use \nof a financial agent in the EPA grants, EPA has demonstrated that the use of a financial agent to \nadminister the funds in Treasury’s shoes is not any distinction at all because Plaintiffs’ rights to \nfederal funds, like the rights at issue in Dept. of Ed., are defined by their grant agreements.   \nAny preliminary injunction that alters the status quo and directs disbursement of funds \nfrom the accounts maintained by the federal financial agent, defendant Citibank, N.A. (Citibank), \nwould cause immediate irreparable injury to the United States, specifically, the potentially \npermanent loss of up to $14 billion in taxpayer funds.  \nLEGAL STANDARD  \n“The factors the Court considers in determining whether a stay pending appeal is \nwarranted are: (1) the likelihood that the party seeking the stay will prevail on the merits of the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 6 of 12\nappeal; (2) the likelihood that the moving party will be irreparably harmed absent a stay; (3) the \nprospect that others will be harmed if the Court grants the stay; and (4) the public interest in \ngranting the stay.  To justify the granting of a stay, a movant need not always establish a high \nprobability of success on the merits.” Citizens For Resp. and Ethics in Washington v. Off. of \nAdmin., 593 F. Supp. 2d 156, 159 (D.D.C. 2009) (quoting Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory \nComm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  \nThe “court is not required to find that ultimate success by the movant is a mathematical \nprobability, and indeed, [ ] may grant a stay even though its own approach may be contrary to the \nmovant’s view of the merits.”  Citizens, 593 F. Supp. 2d at 160.  “In particular, ‘[a]n order \nmaintaining the status quo is appropriate when a serious legal question is presented, when little if \nany harm will befall other interested persons or the public, and when denial of the order would \ninflict irreparable injury on the movant.” Id. (quoting Wash. Metro Area Transit Comm’n v \nHoliday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C.Cir.1977)).  In such a situation, “[t]here is \nsubstantial equity, and need for judicial protection, whether or not movant has shown a \nmathematical probability of success.” Id. (quoting Holiday Tours, 559 F.2d at 844).   \n  “Under this Circuit’s precedent, the harms to each party are tested for ‘substantiality, \nlikelihood of occurrence, and adequacy of proof.’” Id. at 161 (quoting Judicial Watch v. Nat’l \nEnergy Policy Dev. Group, 230 F. Supp. 2d 12, 15 (D.D.C. 2002)).  “The Court must consider the \nsignificance of the change from the status quo which would arise in the absence of a stay, as well \nas likelihood of occurrence of the claimed injury, when determining whether [parties] have truly \nmet their burden of demonstrating irreparable harm justifying imposition of a stay.”  Id.  “A party \nmoving for a stay is required to demonstrate that the injury claimed is ‘both certain and great.’” \nId. (quoting Cuomo, 772 F.2d at 976).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 7 of 12\nARGUMENT \nAs demonstrated in the briefing on Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction, EPA is \nlikely to succeed on an appeal it may be obliged to take, and the government will incur \nirreparable harm absent a stay.  By contrast, extending a moderate delay in accessing grant funds \nwill not substantially harm Grantees or Subgrantees.  And Plaintiffs’ harm under a stay, if any, \ndoes not outweigh the government’s interest in reobligating the funds under a reformed grant \nprogram or duty to act in the public interest to protect the public fisc. \nA.  EPA’s Appeal Presents Serious Legal Questions  \nEPA has presented serious legal questions that warrant a stay pending appeal.  First, as \nhas been briefed, this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiffs’ claims. ECF No. 49 (EPA \nOpp. to PI) at 8–16.  The Court’s exercise of jurisdiction pursuant to the APA’s waiver of the \nfederal government’s sovereign immunity would be in error because that waiver does not apply \n“if any other any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief \nwhich is sought.” Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 \nU.S. 209, 215 (2012) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  And the waiver is limited to claims “seeking \nrelief other than monetary damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702.   \nHere, both Grantees and Subgrantees seek one thing—the payment of money they claim \nis being denied to them under their grant agreements.  Such claims, though dressed as statutory \nand constitutional challenges, are “contract actions” that “the Tucker Act impliedly forbids” \nplaintiffs to bring against “the government in a federal district court.”  Albrecht v. Comm. on \nEmp. Benefits of the Fed. Rsrv. Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  As a \nresult, EPA is likely to prevail in an appeal challenging this Court’s jurisdiction to grant \nPlaintiffs’ injunctive relief.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 8 of 12\nTo reiterate, the Supreme Court’s recent order in U.S. Departmen. of Education v. \nCalifornia, No. 24A910 (Apr. 4, 2025) establishes the government’s likelihood of success in this \ncase.  Like Plaintiffs here, the respondents in Dept. of Ed. contend that the government’s \ntermination of their grants, which relied upon the same termination regulation EPA relies on here \n(2 C.F.R. § 200.340), violated the APA.  See id., Opp. to App. at 22–23 (Mar. 28, 2025).  The \ndistrict court in Dept. of Ed. also entered the same basic relief provided in this Court’s order: \nenjoining the government from “terminating various education related grants” and “to continue \npaying obligations as they accrue.” Id. at 1.3  The Supreme Court recognized in Dept. of Ed. that \nwhile “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an \nagency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds,” Dept. of Ed. Order at 2 (quoting Bowen \nv. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879, 910 (1988)), the “APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not \nextend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ along the lines of what the \nDistrict Court ordered.”  Id. (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. \n204, 212 (2002)).  Here, the result should be same.  See also EPA Opp. to PI at 9-17.  \n  Second, if this Court grants Plaintiffs their requested relief, the Court will have \nerroneously taken control of funding decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law. \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  Review under the APA is unavailable “if a statute is drawn so that a \ncourt would have no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of \ndiscretion.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).  See also, EPA Opp. to PI at 16-17.  In \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), the Supreme Court recognized that an agency decision to \nchange prior funding decisions presented a matter committed to agency discretion by law.  Id. at \n \n3 The district court in Dept. of Ed. also compelled the government “to pay out past-due grant \nobligations.”  Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 9 of 12\n185-88.  Here, Congress entrusted EPA “to make grants, on a competitive basis” for distinct \npurposes, 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a), and left the program’s design and implementation to EPA’s \ndiscretion.  This Court would err if it intruded upon the agency’s entitlement to the same \nprerogatives. See id. at 193 (APA “gives the court no leave to intrude” on agency decisions \ncommitted to agency discretion).  \nIf an appeal is necessary, EPA is likely to succeed in showing that this Court lacks \njurisdiction to order EPA to specifically perform any contractual obligation to provide funding to \nthe Grantees or Subgrantees, for the same reasons recognized in Dept. of Ed. and because the \nagency’s decisions, committed to agency discretion by law, are not subject to judicial review.  At \na minimum, there is substantial equity, and need for judicial protection” here, “whether or not \n[the government] has shown a mathematical probability of success.”  Citizens, 593 F. Supp. 2d at \n160.  District courts have already reached the same conclusion on the jurisdictional issues the \nSupreme Court reached in Dept. of Ed.  See U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops v. United States \nDepartment of State, No. 25-cv-465, 2025 WL 763738 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025); see also Mass. \nFair Hous. Ctr et. al. v. Dept. of Hous. and Urban Dev., et. al., 3:25-cv-30041 (D. Mass.) (April \n14, 2015 Minute Order)4 , A stay here would be warranted to allow for meaningful appellate \nreview “even though [the Court’s] own approach may be contrary to the movant’s view of the \nmerits.”  Citizens, 593 F. Supp. 2d at 160.  \n \n \n \n4  Applying Dept. of Ed., the district court dissolved a TRO for lack of jurisdiction because since \nplaintiffs, like the Dept. of Ed respondents, claim “the agency did not terminate the grant in \naccordance with statutory or regulatory authority—it follows that plaintiffs are likewise likely \nseeking to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money.” \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 10 of 12\nB. Without A Stay The Government Faces Irreparable Injury   \nThe government will suffer irreparable injury absent a stay pending EPA’s appeal.  If this \nCourt allows disbursements from the Citibank accounts, Plaintiffs may immediately attempt to \nmove approximately $625 million and all $14 billion could be equally subject to loss.  See \nHeckler v. Turner, 468 U.S. 1305, 1307-1308 (1984) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (prospect of \nthe government being forced to make $1.3 million in improper payments per month supported a \nstay of injunction).  And that injury would be “both certain and great.” Citizens 593 F. Supp. 2d \nat 161 (quoting Cuomo, 772 F.2d. at 976).  Plaintiffs have already requested approximately $625 \nmillion in external transfers from Citibank, see April 15, 2025 Declaration of Gregg Treml, EPA \nActing Chief Financial Officer, (Treml Decl.) ¶¶ 6-23 and have sent letters purporting to instruct \nCitibank to “take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that, following the Court’s decision, \nCitibank can immediately process all pending transactions. . .”  Id. at Exhibit A (Climate United \nletter) and Exhibit B (CGC letter); see also id. at Exhibit C (PFC letter)(“a single day’s delay is \nunacceptable…”).  Plaintiffs’ grant awards total $14 billion, ECF No. 71 at 4, and there are few \nlimits to what they can expend in short order under the injunction requested from this Court.  The \ngovernment’s harm would be particularly acute in the absence of a bond equal in amount to \nPlaintiffs’ ongoing withdrawals, see Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 65(c), and no grantee promised “to return \nwithdrawn funds should its grant termination be reinstated,” Dept. of Ed. at 2.  Like the Dept. of \nEd. respondents, Plaintiffs here “have not refuted the Government’s representation that it is \nunlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.” Id. \nMoreover, EPA would be irreparably harmed by a continuation of the TRO’s bar on \neffectuating grant termination.  Treml Decl. ¶¶ 4-5.  EPA cannot complete the closeout process, \nreform the program, and reobligate the funds as stated in its termination letters until this cloud on \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 11 of 12\nthe funding is removed.  The government, and potential future grantees, cannot be made whole \nfor this delay, unlike the Grantees and Subgrantees that may seek compensation in the Court of \nFederal Claims.  And every day that goes by is another day EPA is deprived of substantial \ninterest and income on the funds that could otherwise be rolled back into the reformed program. \nC. Equities Favor a Stay Pending Appeal  \nThe balance of the final equitable factors for issuance of a stay, i.e., “…the prospect that \nothers will be harmed if the Court grants the stay; and [] the public interest in granting the stay,” \nCitizens, 593 F. Supp. 2d at 159, tips decisively in government’s favor, for one simple reason:  \nThis case is about money.  If Plaintiffs are ultimately successful in their claims against EPA in \nthe Court of Federal Claims, they may seek to recover loss resulting from EPA’s alleged breach \nof the grant agreements.  If Plaintiffs can be made whole by recovery on a claim for damages, \nthey cannot be substantially harmed by a stay. \nHowever, EPA, for the reasons explained above, cannot be made whole without a stay of \nthese proceedings (or bond, which has not been issued) if later successful on appeal.  The \ngovernment also has a strong interest in safeguarding the public fisc.  See Mathews v. Eldridge, \n424 U.S. 319, 348 (1976).  In fact, “the protection of the public fisc is a matter that is of interest \nto every citizen,” Brock v. Pierce Cnty., 476 U.S. 253, 262 (1986).  Yet, a preliminary injunction \norder that bars the Executive Branch from exercising its authorities to ensure the GGRF is \noperated with the level of oversight and control it prefers threatens the agency’s ability to ensure \nfederal dollars remain protected.  This separation of powers concern cannot be taken lightly, and \ncaution is warranted before ordering immediate preliminary relief that impacts the ability of the \nExecutive Branch to administer a program in a form no longer deems appropriate in the exercise \nof its constitutional functions. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 75     Filed 04/15/25     Page 12 of 12\n*  *  *  *  *  * \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant a stay of any order allowing disbursements \nfrom the Citibank accounts pending resolution of the issues to be presented to the D.C.

The  EPA  says  that  it  has  not  impounded  the  money  Congress \nappropriated to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund because, once the \nagency  succeeds  in  taking  back  the  plaintiffs’  grants,  it  intends  to \nreobligate the money to new grantees.   \n  But whether or not the EPA truly intends to reobligate the money \nto new grantees, it cannot lawfully do so.  Congress specifically made the \nGGRF appropriations available for obligation only until September 30, \n2024.    It  is  an  “elementary  principle”  of  appropriations  law  that  an \nagency may not make new obligations of funds from an appropriation \nafter its expiration date.  West Virginia Ass’n of Cmty. Health Centers, \n \n2 Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 29(a)(4)(E), Amicus states:  No party’s \ncounsel authored this brief in whole or in part.  No party or party’s \ncounsel  contributed  money  that  was  intended  to  fund  preparing  or \nsubmitting this brief.  And no person, other than the Amicus (who is filing \nthe brief pro se) contributed money that was intended to fund preparing \nor submitting the brief. \n  2 \n(Page 8 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 9 of 22\nInc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. Cir. 1984).  That is true even if \nthe agency deobligates funds after the end of its period of availability. \nThe  Government  hints  that  an  injunction  could  require  it  to \nreobligate GGRF money to new grantees.  But this Court has specifically \nheld that an injunction in a suit brought after an appropriation expires \ncannot  revive  that  appropriation.    National  Association  of  Regional \nCouncils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 588–89 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  And no party \nbefore this Court would have standing to seek such an injunction in any \nevent. \nARGUMENT \n \nTHE GOVERNMENT’S DEFENSE AGAINST THE IMPOUNDMENT \nCLAIM RESTS ON A FUNDAMENTAL MISUNDERSTANDING OF \nAPPROPRIATIONS LAW \n \nA. Because the GGRF Appropriation Has Expired, EPA Cannot \nReobligate the Funds at Issue in This Litigation \n \n  The  Government  contends  that  it  has  not  unconstitutionally \nimpounded  money  Congress  appropriated  to  the  Greenhouse  Gas \nReduction  Fund.    Once  EPA  succeeds  in  taking  back  the  money  it \npreviously granted, the Government asserts, the agency “intends to act \nexpeditiously  to  re-obligate  the  grant  funds  under  new  agreements.”  \nGov’t Opening Br. 2. \n  3 \n(Page 9 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 10 of 22\nEPA’s expressed intention to reobligate the grant funds forms the \ncenterpiece of its argument that it has complied with the Constitution.  \nThe  Government’s  brief  sneaks  the  point  into  its  formulation  of  the \nquestion  presented.    See  id.  at  4  (third  Question  Presented  asking \nwhether  “EPA’s  decision  to  terminate  the  grant  agreements  and  re-\nobligate  the  funds  violates  the  Constitution”).    And  it  refers  to  this \nexpressed intention no less than 11 times.  See id. at 2, 4, 12, 16, 36, 37 \n(three times), 38, 39, 41.  It is fair to say that the expressed intention to \nreobligate  the  money  constitutes  the  Government’s  only  substantive \nargument against the claim that it has unconstitutionally impounded \nfunds appropriated to the GGRF.   \nBut  that  argument  contravenes  what  this  Court  has  called  an \n“elementary principle” of appropriations law—that “a federal agency’s \nbudget authority lapses on the last day of the period” for which Congress \nmade an appropriation available.

Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426 (D.C. \nCir. 1994).  “If an agency fails to obligate its annual funds by the end of \nthe  fiscal  year  for  which  they  were  appropriated,  they  cease  to  be \n  4 \n(Page 10 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 11 of 22\navailable for incurring and recording new obligations and are said \nto have ‘expired.’”  1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW \nat 5-6 (3d ed. 2004) (emphasis added).  See also Off. of Nat. Res. Revenue-\nCoop. Agreements, B-321297 at 3 (GAO, Aug. 2, 2011) (noting that “an \nappropriation available for a fixed period of time … expires at midnight \non the last day of its period of availability and is no longer available for \nincurring  new  obligations”);  1  GAO,  PRINCIPLES  OF  FEDERAL \nAPPROPRIATIONS  LAW,  supra,  at  5-71  (A  “1-year  or  multiple  year \nappropriation expires on the last day of its period of availability and is \nno longer available to incur and record new obligations.”). \nThat rule is hardly obscure.  To the contrary, it directly flows from \nthe Constitution’s command that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. \nConst., Art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  As the Supreme Court has explained, that text \nprohibits  the  Executive  Branch  from  spending  money  in  a  way  that \nconflicts with the terms of a statute adopted by Congress.  See Office of \nPers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 424 (1990). \nIn  making  its  appropriations  to  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Reduction \nFund, Congress stated that the money would “remain available until \n  5 \n(Page 11 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 12 of 22\nSeptember 30, 2024.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), (2), (3).  The appropriation \nthus expired on September 30 of last year.  That was the last date on \nwhich EPA could make new obligations from the GGRF.  EPA is thus now \nlegally barred from making new obligations from the account. \nAfter an appropriation expires, the account remains open for five \nyears.  31 U.S.C. § 1552(a).  At that point, however, the appropriation can \nno longer be used to make new obligations; it can be used only “to adjust \nand make payments to liquidate liabilities arising from obligations made \nwithin the fiscal year for which the funds were appropriated.”  1 \nGAO,  PRINCIPLES  OF  FEDERAL  APPROPRIATIONS  LAW,  supra,  at  5-6 \n(emphasis added).  See 31 U.S.C. § 1553(a) (allowing an open but expired \nappropriations account to be used only “for recording, adjusting, and \nliquidating obligations properly chargeable to that account”).   \nSo, if an agency has made an obligation before the appropriation \nexpires,  it  has  five  years  to  actually  disburse  the  money  that  would \nsatisfy (“liquidate”) the obligation.  See 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL \nAPPROPRIATIONS LAW, supra, at 5-72.  An obligation need not be paid out \nimmediately.  Rather, the obligation is simply “a ‘definite commitment \nthat creates a legal liability of the government for the payment of goods \n  6 \n(Page 12 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 13 of 22\nand services ordered or received, or a legal duty … that could mature into \na legal liability by virtue of actions on the part of the other party beyond \nthe control of the United States.’”  Maine Cmty.

See also \nNat’l Mediation Bd. Compensating Neutral Arbs. Appointed to Grievance \nAdjustment Boards Under the Ry. Lab.

Health Options, 590 U.S. at 308. \nDuring the five-year period, the agency may also use the expired \naccount “to make legitimate obligation adjustments, that is, to record \n \n3 The Executive Branch itself has endorsed this formulation of the “well-\nunderstood meaning” of an obligation “in fiscal law.”  The Anti-Deficiency \nAct Implications of Consent by Gov’t Emps. to Online Terms of Serv. \nAgreements Containing Open-Ended Indemnification Clauses, 2012 WL \n5885535, at *5 (O.L.C.

What it may not do, however, is \nmake new obligations from the account.  That is because “[o]bligated \nbudget authority is available only to liquidate liabilities (i.e., obligations) \nlegally  incurred  during  the  period  for  which  the  appropriation  is \navailable.”    Continued  Availability  of  Expired  Appropriation  for \nAdditional Project Phases, B-286929 at 3 (GAO, Apr. 25, 2001).  “Unless \notherwise provided, an agency may not use an appropriation to pay for \nobligations that are properly incurred after the appropriation expires.”  \nU.S. Dep’t of Agric.—Application of Recording Statute, Bona Fide Needs \nStatute,  &  Antideficiency  Act  to  Supplemental  Nutrition  Assistance \nProgram Benefits, B-336036 at 8 (GAO, Feb. 12, 2025). \nIf an agency deobligates funds after the period of availability ends, \nthe same rules apply:  The money goes into the expired account and may \nbe  used  to  satisfy  or  adjust  obligations  that  were  made  before  the \nappropriation expired.  But it may not be used to make new obligations.  \nSee 1 GAO, PRINCIPLES OF FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW, supra, at 5-80 \n(“If an agency deobligates the appropriation after the expiration of the \n  8 \n(Page 14 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 15 of 22\nperiod of availability, the deobligated amount is not available to incur a \nnew  obligation,  but  is  available  to  cover  appropriate  adjustments  to \nobligations in the expired account.”). \nThe Government Accountability Office has enforced this rule on \nnumerous occasions.  In Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation \nfor  Additional  Project  Phases,  supra,  for  example,  a  unit  of  the \nDepartment of the Army obligated $17.5 million of its Fiscal Year 1997 \nappropriation for the first phase of a three-phase project to create a \nclassified information management system.  See id. at 2.  In the event, \nhowever, the first phase cost only $8.5 million.  See id.  During the next \nfiscal year, the Department sought to deobligate the $9 million unspent \nbalance from Fiscal Year 1997 and reobligate it to the second and third \nphases of the project.  See id. \nGAO concluded that the Department “cannot charge payments for \nadditional  phases  of  the  project  to  the  balance  of  the  expired, \nunliquidated  fiscal  year  1997  appropriation.”    Id.  at  4.    GAO \nacknowledged  that  the  Department  could  have  used  its  1997 \nappropriation to pay for all three phases of the project if it had obligated \nthe money for those phases during the fiscal year.  But the Department \n  9 \n(Page 15 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 16 of 22\n“did not take appropriate action to satisfy that need during the fiscal year \nby  contracting  (i.e.,  incurring  valid  obligations)  for  additional  phases \nduring the period of availability of the appropriation.”  Id.  Even though \nthe five-year period for liquidating obligations on the Fiscal Year 1997 \naccount had not yet elapsed, the Department could not make a new \nobligation on that account after the end of that fiscal year.  See id.4 \nIf the EPA were to deobligate money from the GGRF and then seek \nto reobligate it, the agency would stand in exactly the same position as \nthe  Department  of  the  Army  did  in  the  Continued  Availability  case:  \nHaving deobligated funds after their appropriation expired, it could not \nuse those funds for new obligations (which is what a “reobligation” is, see \nGAO, GLOSSARY, supra at 85).  It could use those deobligated funds only \nto  liquidate  and  adjust  existing  obligations  entered  into  before  the \n \n4 See also Expired Funds & Interagency Agreements Between GovWorks \n&  the  Dep’t  of  Def.,  B-308944  at  8  (GAO,  July  17,  2007)  (agency \n“improperly  used  the  expired  funds  to  enter  into”  contracts  when  it \nincurred obligations for those contracts in Fiscal Year 2006 but used \nfunds appropriated for previous fiscal years to pay for the obligations); \nMagnavox—Use of Contract Underrun Funds, B-207433 at 3 (GAO, Sept. \n16, 1983) (noting that “[c]ertainly the Army could have used underrun \nfunds to procure additional viewers at any time during the period those \nfunds remained available for obligation” but concluding that it could not \nuse “expired appropriations” for “an item for which a valid obligation was \nnot incurred” during the period of availability). \n  10 \n(Page 16 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 17 of 22\nappropriations  expired.    Thus,  even  if  EPA  wanted  to  reobligate  the \nGGRF money should it prevail in this litigation, the agency would not be \nlegally able to take that step. \nB. The Courts Cannot Issue an Injunction Requiring EPA to Reobligate \nthe GGRF Funds \n \nAlthough EPA does not acknowledge the basic legal flaw in its \nposition, it does half-heartedly suggest (at 39) that the district court could \nissue “an injunction requiring EPA to re-obligate the grant funds and \nthereby continue the grantmaking process.”  But EPA does not cite any \nauthority allowing such an injunction.  And there are two basic errors in \nthe  suggestion  that  an  injunction  allowing  reobligation  would  be \navailable here. \nFirst, this Court has long held to the contrary.  The decision in \nNational Association of Regional Councils v. Costle, 564 F.2d 583, 588–\n89 (D.C. Cir. 1977), held that a court has the power to issue an injunction \npermitting  new  obligations  only  if  the  suit  was  brought  before  the \nrelevant appropriation expired.  If a court could not enjoin the expiration \nof  the  appropriation  in  such  a  case,  Costle  explained,  the  Executive \nBranch could unlawfully impound funds and then avoid any effective \njudicial review simply by running out the clock until the end of the fiscal \n  11 \n(Page 17 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 18 of 22\nyear: The proposition “that a court may act to prevent the expiration of \nbudget authority which has not terminated at the time suit is filed,” \nCostle said, is “completely consistent with the accepted principle that the \nequity powers of the courts allow them to take action to preserve the \nstatus  quo  of  a  dispute  and  to  protect  their  ability  to  decide  a  case \nproperly before them.”  Id. at 588.   \nBut things are very different when litigation is not filed until after \nan  appropriation  expires.    In  such  circumstances—which  is  the  case \nhere—“there is no underlying congressional authorization for the court \nto preserve.  It has vanished, and any order of the court to obligate public \nmoney conflicts with the constitutional provision vesting sole power to \nmake such authorizations in the Congress.”  Id. at 589.  The Supreme \nCourt has specifically held that “[a]ny exercise of a power granted by the \nConstitution to one of the other branches of Government is limited by a \nvalid reservation of congressional control over funds in the Treasury.”  \nRichmond, 496 U.S. at 425.  See also Stitzel-Weller Distillery v. Wickard, \n118 F.2d 19, 24 (D.C. Cir. 1941) (Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 overrides \nany right to “judicial enforcement of whatever equities may exist”). \n  12 \n(Page 18 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 19 of 22\nAs  GAO  notes,  “[t]he  principles  set  forth  in  Costle  have  been \nfollowed  and  applied  in  several  later  cases.”    1  GAO, PRINCIPLES OF \nFEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS LAW,  supra,  at  5-85  (collecting  cases).    For \nexample,  this  Court’s  decisions  in  West  Virginia  Community  Health \nCenters, 734 F.2d at 1576–77, and City of Houston, 24 F.3d at 1426, \nspecifically reaffirmed Costle.  Because this lawsuit was not filed until \nafter the relevant appropriation expired, the court lacks power to issue \nan injunction allowing new obligations. \nSecond, there is no party before the Court who would have standing \nto seek such an injunction even if the Court had the power to issue it.  \nThe plaintiffs brought this suit to redress the injury that occurred when \nthe EPA sought to pull back grant funds that had already been obligated \nto  them.    An  order  “requiring  EPA  to  re-obligate  the  grant  funds,” \nOpening Br. 39, would exacerbate rather than redress their injury.5  And \nthe defendants obviously lack standing to seek an injunction against \nthemselves.  If it were otherwise, agencies could evade the fundamental \nrule against new obligations after the expiration of an appropriation by \n \n5  By  contrast,  the  relief  the  plaintiffs  actually  requested  poses  no \nredressability problem.  That relief would prevent EPA from interfering \nwith plaintiffs’ receipt of the money that EPA already obligated to them. \n  13 \n(Page 19 of Total)\n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2115401            Filed: 05/12/2025      Page 20 of 22\nsimply going into court and seeking permission to ignore that rule.  That \nis not how our federal court system—which can issue relief against a \nparty only if doing so will redress an injury of an adverse party—works. \n*** \n  In short, if it succeeds in taking back the GGRF grant funds it has \nalready obligated to plaintiffs, EPA cannot legally reobligate those funds.  \nIts efforts to block the GGRF grants thus constitute a refusal to spend \ncongressionally appropriated funds. \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe judgment of the district court should be affirmed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/ Samuel R.

This case seeks to vindicate the right of Plaintiff Climate United Fund (“Climate \nUnited”) to access grant funds to which it is legally entitled and to enjoin EPA’s illegal termination \nof its grant. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 2 of 62\n \n2.  On October 12, 2023, Climate United applied for grant funding from EPA through \nthe National Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund (“GGRF”). Climate United sought this grant funding to support Climate United’s efforts to \noffer financing for critical clean energy projects that accelerate local economic development, save \nmoney for American families and small businesses, spur demand for domestic manufacturing, \ncreate jobs, and reduce air pollution.  \n3.  In April 2024, Climate United was awarded a grant after a rigorous and competitive \napplication process. Climate United brought together three well-established nonprofits with a \ncombined 120 years of experience managing more than $30 billion in private and institutional \ncapital. Climate United did not have any relationship with anyone inside EPA or, to its knowledge, \nwith any reviewers across the agencies during the application and selection process. Since being \nannounced as a grantee, Climate United has funded projects across the United States that support \ndomestic clean energy development, build healthy and affordable housing, accelerate American-\nmade electric vehicle manufacturing, and save hard-working Americans money on their bills. \n4.  The grant requires Climate United’s award funds to be held at Citibank, N.A. \n(“Citibank”) under a Financial Agency Agreement (“FAA”) between Citibank and the U.S. \nTreasury Department, and an Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between Citibank, Climate \nUnited, and EPA. Arrangements like the FAA have been used by the Federal Government since \nthe 1860s to allow the federal government to contract for financial services that the government \ncannot provide itself—in this case, to create accounts in the name of a recipient. EPA contemplated \nthis arrangement from the program’s inception, and described it in the original Notice of Funding \nOpportunity (“NOFO”) in July 2023 as critical both to allow recipients to leverage private capital \nand to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.”  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 3 of 62\n \n5.  EPA  designed, structured, and negotiated the FAA and the ACA to provide \ntransparency and accountability and to protect EPA’s interests. The FAA requires that Citibank \nprovide online access to EPA personnel “to allow full account visibility” into each account.1 The \nACA includes provisions that allow EPA to take “exclusive control” of the funds at Citibank under \ncertain specified conditions: if Climate United engages in “substantial” noncompliance with the \nTerms and Conditions of the grant; if EPA finds “adequate evidence” of “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” \ndefined as “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal law or the False Claims Act; or if \nClimate United made a “material misrepresentation of eligibility status.” The ACA also specifies \nthe procedure that EPA must follow to take exclusive control of the funds—namely, delivering a \n“Notice of Exclusive Control,” with a “written determination and finding” that Climate United has \ntriggered one of the three grounds for terminating the grant. If EPA does not deliver a Notice of \nExclusive Control with that written determination and finding, then Citibank must disburse funds \nat Climate United’s request. \n6.  Although no Notice of Exclusive Control had been delivered, Citibank began \nrefusing to process Climate United’s disbursement requests, despite Citibank’s unambiguous \ncontractual obligation to do so under the ACA. This left Climate United unable to access the grant \nfunds to which it is entitled.  \n7.  Prior to Climate United’s filing of this lawsuit on March 8, 2025, Citibank provided \nno explanation for its refusals. Nor did EPA. Although EPA’s Administrator made numerous \npublic statements expressing hostility to the GGRF program, he provided no legal justification for \nCitibank’s withholding of funds, despite Climate United’s many inquiries.  \n \n1 Pursuant to the Court’s March 12, 2025 sealing order, Climate United has quoted only portions \nof the FAA that were quoted in Citibank’s TRO opposition, Dkt. 14. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 4 of 62\n \n8.  On March 8, 2025, Climate United filed this lawsuit. It moved for a temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”) on March 10, 2025. When EPA and Citibank filed their response briefs \non March 12, 2025, they revealed for the first time what was happening behind the scenes. Among \nother things: \na.  On February 17, FBI, at EPA’s behest, sent a letter to Citibank “recommending” \nthat Citibank freeze GGRF funds for 30 days. The letter did not cite any facts \nindicating Climate United had engaged in any misconduct. Still, Citibank construed \nthat letter as imposing a legal obligation under the FAA to cooperate with FBI’s \nrequest. EPA’s actions were unconstitutional. The government lacked probable \ncause (indeed, had no evidence) that this freeze was justified; did not obtain a \nwarrant after submitting a sworn affidavit to a neutral magistrate; gave Climate \nUnited no notice of the freeze; affirmatively misled Climate United by publicly \ndeclaring that Citibank was acting “voluntarily”; and afforded Climate United no \nprocess. Citibank’s actions also were beyond Citibank’s authority under the ACA \nand FAA,  which do  not permit  Citibank to  freeze funds based on an  FBI \n“recommendation.” And Citibank had no other legal basis for freezing Climate \nUnited’s funds based on this illegal “recommendation” from FBI. \nb.  On March 4 and March 10, the Department of the Treasury, at EPA’s behest, \ndirected Citibank not to disburse funds from Climate United’s accounts for a \nspecified period. Climate United received no notice of these actions, even though \nit  had specifically asked Citibank if the funds had been frozen because of a \ngovernmental directive. These actions were unconstitutional and were beyond \nCitibank’s authority under the FAA and ACA.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 5 of 62\n \n9.  Climate United’s March 10, 2025 motion for TRO requested, among other things, \nthat EPA be enjoined from unlawfully suspending or terminating the grant. This Court tentatively \nscheduled a hearing for the afternoon of March 11, 2025. After the parties received notice of the \ntentative hearing time, EPA’s counsel requested a 24-hour extension of time, purportedly as a \nmatter of “courtesy.” Climate United consented to that extension. \n10.  EPA took advantage of that courtesy. After business hours on March 11, 2025—\nafter the originally scheduled time for the TRO hearing—EPA purported to accomplish precisely \nwhat Climate United was seeking to enjoin at the TRO hearing: the unlawful termination of the \ngrant. Specifically, EPA served Climate United with a purported “Notice of Termination.” The \nnext day, EPA filed a brief stating that because it had served this “Notice” prior to the TRO hearing, \nthe case was now moot. EPA has stated that it terminated not just Climate United’s grant, but all \neight grants under NCIF and a related program. \n11.  The “Notice of Termination” claimed that EPA was terminating the grant based on \nEPA’s “authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40, the General Terms and Conditions of EPA \nassistance award agreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and the Agency’s \ninherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.” Dkt. 13-1 at 1. \nThe “Notice” also mentioned EPA’s interest in transparency and oversight. Tellingly, however, \nthe “Notice” did not say anything about Climate United, and did not provide any legal or factual \nbasis to believe that any of the ACA’s or the grant’s termination conditions had been satisfied. \n12.  EPA’s “Notice of Termination” was illegal for numerous reasons. It violated EPA’s \nown regulations, which did not permit EPA to terminate the grant based on generic assertions \nregarding transparency and oversight. It violated the Inflation Reduction Act, the Appropriations \nClause, and bedrock separation-of-powers principles by nullifying a duly enacted statute purely \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 6 of 62\n \nbecause the Administrator disagreed with it. Finally, it was arbitrary and capricious. It made vague \naccusations of waste, fraud, and abuse, with nothing to back up those accusations. In point of fact, \nnot one of EPA’s documents, public statements, or investigations has identified anything Climate \nUnited has done improperly, much less something that would rise to the level that permits \ntermination of the grant.  \n13.  Citibank’s refusals to  honor Climate United’s requests are also illegal.  Until \nCitibank receives a Notice of Exclusive Control, it must honor Climate United’s requests. The \npurported “Notice of Termination” is no basis for Citibank to disregard Climate United’s requests \nbecause that Notice is itself illegal and must be enjoined. Nor is the FAA, which allows Citibank \nto freeze assets only “in accordance with” the ACA, and only in response to “lawful instructions” \nfrom EPA. FAA § 5.B.iv; FAA Ex. A § I.B.4. But here, the freeze was not “in accordance with” \nthe ACA and there were no “lawful instructions” from EPA or any other agency. The freeze was \nbased on statements by EPA, the unlawful FBI “recommendation”—which provided no evidence, \nmuch less probable cause, of any criminal activity—and unsupported and unlawful statements by \nTreasury. \n14.  EPA’s unlawful actions are causing Climate United to suffer real and immediate \nharm. Aside from stopgap charitable grants covering solely essential operating expenses, which \nClimate United will need to pay back if its funding is restored, Climate United does not have other \ncommitted sources of funding to replace the NCIF grant funds. As a result of Defendants’ actions, \nto preserve its available cash, Climate United has already been compelled to defer compensation \nfor certain employees, slash staff salaries, terminate multiple vendors, cancel travel, and instruct \nnon-essential lawyers, accountants, and consultants to cease work. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 7 of 62\n \n15.  Climate United’s reliability as a source of capital is fundamental to its ability to \ncarry out its mission and workplan. As a lender, and in particular as a lender to infrastructure and \nconstruction projects which are funded over a period of months or years, developers require \nconfidence that Climate United is able to fulfill its all of its funding commitments for the life of \ntheir projects. But without a stable source of funding, Climate United’s reputation will  be \nirreparably and irreversibly harmed, and Climate United will be unable to attract the high-quality \npartners and co-investors, and secure the attractive deal terms, necessary to develop and carry out \nclean energy projects. Indeed, as a result of its funds being frozen, Climate United has confronted \nincreasingly unfavorable terms from essential vendors and prospective transaction partners, many \nof whom have explicitly said they are unwilling to do deals with Climate United while its funding \nis uncertain.  \n16.  If Climate United does not obtain a preliminary injunction, and is forced to wait to \nhave access to its grant funding restored, Climate United would not survive as it exists today and \nwould need to wind-down as a going concern. Climate United likely would be forced to lay off \nsubstantially all staff and may not be able to reopen for business again, given the lost staff, deals, \nand reputational harm. Without additional funding, Climate United would not be able to litigate \nthis case to judgment. \n17.  Climate United’s access to its grant funding should be restored and its rights should \nbe vindicated. The Court should enjoin EPA’s illegal “Notice of Termination” and enjoin EPA \nfrom taking actions premised on that illegal termination, including directing Citibank to withhold \nfunds and sending Citibank a Notice of Exclusive Control. The Court should also enjoin Citibank \nfrom violating the unambiguous terms of the ACA. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 8 of 62\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n18.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on EPA’s violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act,  federal regulations and statutes, and the Constitution’s \nAppropriations Clause and Due Process Clause. This action also seeks declaratory and injunctive \nrelief and replevin based on Citibank’s breach of contract and conversion. \n19.  The Court has jurisdiction over Climate United’s claims against Defendants EPA \nand Administrator Zeldin under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n20.  The Court has jurisdiction over Climate United’s claims against Citibank under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367, because those claims are so related to Climate United’s claims against EPA that \nthey are part of the same case or controversy.2  \n21.  Venue is proper in this district because EPA  is located in this district and a \nsubstantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e). \n22.  This case presents a live controversy about whether EPA lawfully terminated \nClimate United’s grant, or instead whether EPA’s termination is unlawful because it is arbitrary \nand capricious and violates multiple regulations, statutes, and constitutional provisions. This case \nalso presents a live controversy about whether Citibank breached and is continuing to breach the \nACA.  \nPARTIES \n23.  Climate United, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \nMaryland, is a nonprofit financial institution whose mission is to leverage public and private \n \n2 Even if EPA was not named as a defendant, the Court would have jurisdiction over Climate \nUnited’s claims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the parties are of diverse \ncitizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 9 of 62\n \nfinancing to remove financial barriers to deploying clean energy. Climate United’s work aims to \nunleash American clean energy and build a stronger, more efficient, and more resilient economy \nthat lowers energy costs, creates jobs, improves public health, and benefits every American, while \nmaking the United States more competitive, secure, and energy independent.  \n24.  The Climate United coalition brings together three established nonprofits—Calvert \nImpact, Inc. and its affiliates (“Calvert Impact”), Community Preservation Corporation, and Center \nfor Community Self-Help and its affiliates (“Self-Help”)—that have a combined 120 years of \nexperience managing more than $30 billion in private and institutional capital that has unlocked \neconomic opportunity for communities in all 50 states and territories.  \n25.  Climate United helps fill market gaps where private capital is missing, bringing the \neconomic benefits of clean energy, electric mobility, and building efficiency projects to overlooked \nmarkets. From Arkansas to Alaska, these projects will deliver direct benefits to hard-working \nAmericans and communities in the form of lower energy bills, quality jobs, cleaner air and water, \nand more secure and reliable energy. Climate United focuses its loans and investments in rural, \nlow-income, and Tribal communities across the country, building demand for clean energy and \nproviding markets for  domestic manufacturing. Climate United’s investments also mobilize \nprivate capital, stretching public dollars to go further: for every dollar invested in a program or \nproject, Climate United estimates up to four dollars of private capital flow into communities.  \n26.  Defendant Citibank, N.A. is a national banking association organized and existing \nunder the laws of the United States of America, with headquarters in South Dakota. Citibank is the \nwholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc., headquartered in New York. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 10 of 62\n \n27.  Defendant EPA is the agency of the federal government of the United States \nresponsible for administering the GGRF and its constituent NCIF program. EPA is an agency \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  \n28.  Defendant Lee Zeldin is the EPA Administrator and the agency’s highest ranking \nofficial. Climate United sues Administrator Zeldin in his official capacity.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Congress Establishes the NCIF Program. \n \n29.  In 2022, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the Inflation \nReduction Act. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818. The Act amended the Clean Air Act to \nauthorize the GGRF, which appropriated $27 billion to invest in clean energy in communities \nacross the county. See 42 U.S.C. § 7434; About the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, EPA, \nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/about-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund  (last \nupdated Feb. 13, 2025).  \n30.  The statute created this new program to leverage public funds with private capital \nand catalyze investment into places and projects that support local economic development, much \nlike other government programs such as Small Business Administration loan guarantees, New \nMarket Tax Credits, and Opportunity Zones. \n31.  The GGRF essentially establishes “[g]reen banks,” which are “financial institutions \naimed at overcoming market barriers and scaling up investment in low-carbon technologies and \nclimate-resilient infrastructure.” Cong. Rsch. Serv. IN12090, EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund (updated Feb. 14, 2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12090. Green \nbanks are generally used “to deliver projects that are not sufficiently met by other financial \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 11 of 62\n \nmarkets.” Green Banks, EPA, https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/green-banks (last updated \nJan. 24, 2025).  \n32.  Specifically, Section 134(a)(2) of the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated to the \nEPA Administrator $11.97 billion “to make grants, on a competitive basis … , to eligible recipients \nfor the purposes of providing financial assistance and technical assistance in accordance with \nsubsection (b).” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2).  \n33.  Section 134(a)(3) of the Act appropriated to the EPA Administrator $8 billion to \n“make grants, on a competitive basis … , to eligible recipients for the purposes of providing \nfinancial assistance and technical assistance in low-income and disadvantaged communities in \naccordance with subsection (b).” Id. § 7434(a)(3). \n34.  In turn, Section 134(b) of the Act, entitled “Use of funds,” provides that an eligible \nrecipient shall use the grant as follows: (1) to “provide financial assistance to qualified projects at \nthe national, regional, State, and local levels”; (2) to “prioritize investment in qualified projects \nthat would otherwise lack access to financing”; (3) to “retain, manage, recycle, and monetize all \nrepayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid loans, and all other types of \nfinancial assistance provided using grant funds under this section to ensure continued operability”; \nand (4) to “provide funding and technical assistance to establish new or support existing public, \nquasi-public, not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial assistance to qualified \nprojects.” Id. § 7434(b).  \n35.  An “eligible recipient” is defined to include a nonprofit organization that “is \ndesigned to  provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial \nassistance for the rapid deployment of low-  and zero-emission products, technologies, and \nservices,” that “does not take deposits other than deposits from repayments and other revenue \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 12 of 62\n \nreceived from financial assistance provided using grant funds under this section,” that “is funded \nby public or charitable contributions,” and that “invests in or finances projects alone or in \nconjunction with other investors.” Id. § 7434(c)(1).  \n36.  Qualified projects are defined to include any “project, activity, or technology” that \neither “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership \nwith, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector,” or “assists communities in the efforts \nof those communities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air \npollution.” Id. § 7434(c)(3).  \n37.  Congress imposed a statutory deadline that required the EPA Administrator to use \nthe appropriated funds “to make grants, on a competitive basis,” between February 12, 2023 and \nSeptember 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2), (3). \n38.  In July 2023, EPA launched three grant competitions, including the approximately \n$14 billion National Clean Investment Fund competition geared at “financ[ing] clean technology \ndeployment nationally.” NOFO at 3. The NCIF program was “funded with $11.97 billion from \nSection 134(a)(2) and $2.00 billion from Section 134(a)(3).” Frequent Questions About the Fund, \nEPA,  https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/frequent-questions-about-fund  (last \nupdated Oct. 17, 2024).  \n39.  The purpose of the NCIF  competition was to “provide grants to 2-3 national \nnonprofit financing entities to create national clean financing institutions capable of partnering \nwith the private sector to provide accessible, affordable financing for tens of thousands of clean \ntechnology projects nationwide.” NOFO at 4. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 13 of 62\n \nB.  Climate United Is Awarded NCIF Grant Funding. \n \n40.  Following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Calvert Impact, Community \nPreservation Corporation, and Self-Help joined together to form a coalition to apply for the GGRF \ncompetition.  \n41.  Calvert Impact has been in operation for 30 years in the private markets, investing \nin job creation, affordable housing, clean energy, and local economic development. The other \nClimate United coalition members have been in operation for 50 years and 40 years respectively, \nexecuting investment portfolios and strategies that directly relate to Climate United’s workplan. \nCombined, the members of the Climate United coalition have more than 120 years’ experience \nmanaging more than $30 billion in private and institutional capital.  \n42.  In 2022, Climate United was created as a separate legal entity, and structured as a \nsubsidiary of Calvert Impact, Inc., to apply for GGRF funding. It  is  common practice for \nestablished organizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and programs. \n43.  While each of the coalition partners would have been eligible recipients for GGRF \nfunds,  each  deliberately formed  bespoke subsidiaries to  act  as  the  grant  recipients  and \nsubrecipients. As Climate United explained to EPA, this structure allowed them “to adopt custom \npolicies, procedures, and governance specifically crafted to most efficiently deploy NCIF funds \nwhile mitigating deployment risk.” See CUF Narrative Proposal at 4, EPA (Apr. 4, 2024), https://\nwww.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-04/cuf_narrative_proposal1.pdf.  The  subsidiaries \nbenefit from the organizational infrastructure and experience of their parent organizations while \nallowing them to leverage grant funds with private capital more effectively as stand-alone entities.  \n44.  On July 14, 2023, EPA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for the NCIF. The \nNOFO “included a robust set of application requirements and corresponding evaluation criteria \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 14 of 62\n \nthat were used to assess materials submitted to meet those application requirements.3 “Application \nrequirements covered a diverse set of topics and included not just a detailed project narrative but \nalso a robust set of application attachments,” such as “organizational and governing documents; \nresumes of board members and senior management; legal and compliance risk management \npolicies  and  procedures;  financial  statements;  workplans  for  the  first  year  of  program \nimplementations, and budget narratives.”4  \n45.  The NOFO provided that the NCIF competition was open for applications until \nOctober 12, 2023. NOFO at 1. The NOFO further provided that the “Anticipated Notification of \nSelections” would occur by March 2024, and that the “Anticipated Start of Period of Performance” \nwould be July 2024. Id. The NOFO also mentioned that the “EPA General Terms and Conditions \nmay be subject to measures or other arrangements,” such as “financial agent arrangements with \nthe U.S. Department of Treasury,” to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” Id. at 56. \n46.  EPA established a rigorous process to review and select applications. That process \nincluded an evaluation of each applicant’s program plan, organizational capacity, previous \nexperience managing third-party capital, and experience managing financial, credit, compliance, \nand other risks. The review was conducted by expert panels with broad and deep qualifications \nwho would then present rankings and recommendations to a Selection Official authorized to make \nthe final selection for awards. Id. at 54.  \n47.  Climate United entered the NCIF grant competition with a $13.97 billion proposal \nto accelerate clean energy adoption across the U.S. economy, including by offering affordable \nfinancing for clean technology programs. As part of the application process, Climate United was \n \n3 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Review and Selection Process, EPA (last updated Aug. 16, \n2024), https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/review-and-selection-process.  \n4 Id. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 15 of 62\n \nrequired to submit a detailed budget to EPA, along with proposed policies and organizational \ndocuments. Climate  United’s  application also  included  letters  of  support from  financial \ninstitutions, developers, labor organizations, affordable housing organizations, and state and local \ngovernment—a testament to the coalition’s deep and extensive experience backing up its proposed \nprogram plan. Additionally, prior to receiving the Notice of Award, Climate United was required \nto attach a negotiated, thoroughly reviewed, and approved budget to its grant agreement.  \n48.  Following the agency’s lengthy and rigorous review process, Climate United was \nawarded $6.97 billion. The award was publicly announced by the White House in April 2024, in a \npress release touting Climate United’s credentials and vision.5  \n49.  Consistent with the purpose of the Inflation Reduction Act under which the NCIF \nfunds were appropriated, Climate United developed and EPA approved a workplan that was \nfinalized with the award and posted publicly for full transparency. As enumerated in the workplan, \nthe Climate United coalition plans to commit at least $580 million toward qualified projects in the \nfirst year of funding (i.e., before July 2025), and to draw the full $6.97 billion over the first five \nyears of the program. To date, the Climate United coalition has committed $392 million to \nqualified projects. Approximately 45% of Climate United investments (the portion of the funds \nprovided through financial assistance), or approximately $2.8 billion of the NCIF Award, will \nfocus on investing in energy-efficient buildings and homes. Approximately 20% of Climate United \ninvestments, or approximately $1.2 billion of the NCIF Award, will focus on electric transportation \nand charging infrastructure. Another approximately 25% of Climate United investments, or \n \n5 Biden-Harris Administration Announces $20 Billion in Grants to Mobilize Private Capital and \nDeliver Clean Energy and Climate Solutions to Communities Across America, EPA (last updated \nAug.  16,  2024), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-\nbillion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 16 of 62\n \napproximately $1.5 billion of the NCIF  Award, will  focus on producing affordable, clean \nelectricity and heat through renewable energy generation and battery storage, including through \nsolar, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. The remaining 10% of investments will focus on other \nsectors that cut costs, reduce pollution, and provide direct benefits to American families, including \nin agriculture. Further, consistent with the terms of the grant award, Climate United will deploy \n60% of its investments in low- and moderate- income communities, 20% of its investments in rural \ncommunities and 10% of its investments in Tribal communities. \nC.  The Terms and Conditions of the Grant, Including Suspending or \nTerminating the Grant.  \n \n50.  On April 11, 2024, shortly after the award was publicly announced, EPA held a \n“terms and conditions briefing” for awardees. Among other things, EPA explained the process for \nagreeing upon the terms and conditions that would govern the grant. EPA explained that it expected \nto share draft terms in mid-to-late April, and that EPA expected the terms to change based on \nawardee feedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for awardee workplans. While \nnoting the “dates are tentative,” EPA expected a “final” set of terms to be included in a final grant \nagreement known as a Notice of Award (“NOA”) in late June, modified terms to be agreed upon \nin  September/October, additional modifications to  occur in  October/November, and further \nmodifications “over the remainder of the performance period.”  \n51.  Climate United’s award was memorialized in the NOA dated August 8, 2024 \n[hereinafter “August NOA”]. The August NOA appended Terms and Conditions governing the \ngrant. The Terms and Conditions in the August NOA included several requirements regarding the \nuse of GGRF funding, including labor and workforce requirements, id. at 34, “Buy America” \nrequirements, id. at 28, consumer protection requirements, id. at 36, and training requirements, id. \nat 33-34.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 17 of 62\n \n52.  The Terms and Conditions in the August NOA required Climate United to adhere \nto a rigorous set of reporting requirements. These include requirements to produce quarterly, semi-\nannual,  annual,  and  final  reports  to  EPA  with  “detailed  narratives  describing  program \nperformance … supported with qualitative discussions and quantitative metrics,” id. at 16, submit \nquarterly transaction-level and project-level data reports, id. at 17-18, and provide ongoing \ndisclosures to EPA, id. at 18-19.  \n53.  The Terms and Conditions in the August NOA provided that Climate United “must \nobtain prior written approval from the EPA Project Officer (who will in turn notify the EPA Award \nOfficial) for any transfers that will not be disbursed for an Allowable Activity within 15 business \ndays.” Id. at 61. \n54.  In addition, the Terms and Conditions required Climate United (as well as other \nGGRF recipients) to complete standard EPA grants training within 90 days of receipt of the grant, \nincluding the “EPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and Recipients” and “How to \nDevelop a Budget.” Id. at 8. Climate United complied with this requirement, even though Climate \nUnited had already submitted a detailed budget to EPA in connection with the grant competition \nselection process, and had already attached a negotiated, reviewed, and approved budget to its \ngrant agreement before receiving the Notice of Award. \n55.  As EPA had initially envisioned, the August NOA was amended on December 20, \n2024 [hereinafter “December NOA”] to update the Terms and Conditions which apply to all NCIF \nrecipients. The December NOA was substantially similar to the August NOA, and notably did not \nsubstantively change the  overall  grant  award or  provisions regarding  EPA’s  oversight  or \nunderlying reporting and transparency requirements. The changes primarily reflected the insights \ngained from months of feedback from going to market with the program, in particular clarifying \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 18 of 62\n \nthe applicability of “Build America, Buy America” requirements and the applicability of Davis \nBacon and Related Acts to projects. The December NOA also updated the Terms and Conditions \nto account for Citigroup being selected by the Treasury Department to serve as its financial agent \nunder the Financial Agency Agreement entered into on September 19, 2024, see infra ¶¶ 60-70; \nclarified the definitions of “Waste, Fraud, and Abuse” and “Materially Impaired”; clarified which \nversions of the applicable regulations govern termination of the grant; and specified certain \nprocedures involved in issuing notices about the grant funds to financial institutions. December \nNOA at 12, 41, 56. The changes in the December NOA were unrelated to any changes in \nAdministration.  \n56.  The Terms and Conditions in the December NOA describe the three specific \nrequirements with which EPA must comply to suspend or terminate Climate United’s award. \nDecember NOA at 41. The Terms and Conditions do not allow EPA to unilaterally suspend the \ngrant or remove Climate United’s ability to access funding. The Terms and Conditions state that \n“EPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only” in the following situations. \nDecember NOA at 41 (emphasis added): \na.  First, EPA may terminate the Agreement if Climate United engages in “substantial” \nnoncompliance such that “effective performance” is “Materially Impaired.” Id. \nEffective performance is “Materially Impaired” if (1)  EPA  issues a  “written \ndetermination and finding … that the Recipient has failed to achieve sufficient \nprogress in accordance with the Sufficient Progress  clause” and, (2) if EPA \ndetermines in its sole discretion that a “corrective action plan” would remedy the \nissue, EPA must issue a “separate written determination and finding” that the \nRecipient “has not materially addressed its failure.” Id. at 8-9.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 19 of 62\n \nb.  Second, EPA may terminate the Agreement if Climate United engages in “material \nmisrepresentation of eligibility status.” Id. at 41.  \nc.  Third, EPA  may terminate the Agreement if there is “adequate evidence” of \n“Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” id., which is defined with reference to EPA’s General \nTerms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § 200.113. Those sources require “credible \nevidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, \nconflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United \nStates Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. [§§] 3729-\n3733).” See EPA, General Terms and Conditions (effective Oct. 1, 2024), https://\nwww.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_\nconditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.pdf; 2 C.F.R. § 200.113. \n57.  In addition, EPA is obligated by regulation to take certain procedural steps if it \nwishes to terminate the grant agreement. Among other things, EPA must comply with 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.341, which requires EPA to provide written notice of termination to the recipient that \nincludes “the reasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to \nbe terminated, if applicable.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.341; December NOA at 41 (incorporating this \nregulatory requirement into the Terms and Conditions).  \n58.  The Terms and Conditions of the award set forth the EPA requirements, including \nall relevant oversight, reporting, termination and programmatic requirements, and apply to all \nNCIF recipients. The workplan and budget reflect Climate United’s proposed investment and \ndeployment strategy. There are two different workstreams within EPA, with different approval \nprocesses and different personnel, that address the grant’s Terms and Conditions and the grant’s \nbudget and workplan. This led to separate NOA amendments in December and January. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 20 of 62\n \n59.  As EPA envisioned from the outset, there was a further amendment to the NOA on \nJanuary 16, 2025. This amendment modified Climate United’s workplan and budget—to tweak \nthe allocation of grant funds within specified budget categories, to align with updates to the Code \nof Federal Regulations, and to update the workplan to reflect market feedback. Compare December \nNOA at 3, with January NOA at 3. The January NOA did not change the operative Terms and \nConditions attached to the December NOA or alter the overall grant award. January NOA at 1, 4-\n5. The Terms and Conditions in the December NOA are thus the operative Terms and Conditions \nthat remain binding on Climate United and EPA. The changes in the January NOA were unrelated \nto any changes in Administration. \nD.  The Financial Agency Agreement Between Citibank and the Treasury \nDepartment. \n \n60.  The July 2023 NOFO envisioned entering into “financial agent arrangements with \nthe U.S. Department of Treasury” to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” NOFO at 56. \nClimate United had no role in EPA’s decision to include the financial agent concept in the July \n2023 NOFO.  \n61.  The financial agent concept is an established mechanism for disbursing government \nfunding that was first authorized in the 1860s and has been used for decades.6  \n62.  After a selection process run by the Treasury Department, Citibank was selected as \nthe Financial Agent. Citibank and Treasury entered into the FAA on September 19, 2024. \n63.   Climate United is not a party to the FAA. Citibank’s selection as the Financial \nAgent was announced to Climate United on September 26, 2024. Climate United had no role in \n \n6 Revenue Collections and Payments: Treasury Has Used Financial Agents in Evolving Ways but \nCould Improve Transparency, GAO-17-176 (Jan. 2017), https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-\n176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions of \ndisbursing payments and collecting revenue.”). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 21 of 62\n \nthe selection of the financial agent, which was coordinated by EPA and the Treasury Department \nas part of a competitive process.  \n64.  The FAA provides that Citibank will provide “commercial banking and finance \nservices” “related to programs under the Inflation Reduction Act … including grant programs” \nsuch as the NCIF. FAA at 1, A-1. The FAA is not specific to Climate United’s grant and Climate \nUnited is not mentioned in the FAA. \n65.  The FAA provides that Citibank “acknowledges and agrees that it owes a fiduciary \nduty of loyalty and fair dealing to the United States when acting as a financial agent of the United \nStates.” Id. § 5.A. The FAA further provides that as a financial agent, Citibank will “act at all times \nin the best interests of the United States when carrying out its responsibilities under this FAA and \nin all matters connected with this agency relationship.” Id. The FAA further states that Citibank’s \nfiduciary obligations include the duty to  “construe the terms of this FAA  and any related \ninstructions from Treasury in a reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of the United \nStates” and “to act only within the scope of its actual authority and to comply with all lawful \ninstructions or directions received from Treasury.” Id. \n66.  The FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts, and transfer funds in frozen \naccounts, at the direction of the relevant secured party [i.e., EPA], in accordance with the account \ncontrol agreements.” Id. at Ex. A § I.B.4. \n67.  The FAA provides EPA with “full account visibility,” id. at Ex. A § I.D.1. The \nFAA thus gives EPA full, real time view access into all accounts of Climate United and its \nsubrecipients, and full transparency into how grant funds are being spent. Climate United and its \nsubrecipients each have seven distinct accounts, for twenty-one accounts in total. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 22 of 62\n \n68.  EPA has traditionally used the Automated Standard Application for Payments \n(“ASAP”) system to disburse award funds. The ASAP system allows recipients to draw funds as \nneeded—for example, for funding a project or paying for administrative costs. While the entire \naward amount would be obligated to the recipient, the recipient’s balance sheet would only reflect \nthose award funds drawn down. One of the primary objectives of the NCIF program is to use \ngovernment funds to spur private capital. The traditional ASAP mechanism would not allow for a \nrecipient to raise private capital on its own balance sheet. EPA understood the need to solve for \nthis technical accounting problem, and EPA’s original design of the program, described in the July \n2023 NOFO, proposed a financial agent mechanism. NOFO at 56. The ability of the recipient to \ndraw down award funds would remain unchanged, but the balance sheet of the recipients would \nreflect the entire award amount rather than only the funds already expended.  \n69.  The  oversight  and  accountability provisions of Climate  United’s award  are \ncontained within its agreement with EPA, specifically within the NCIF Terms and Conditions. The \nTreasury Department under the ASAP system does not conduct oversight—it simply reports to \nEPA the amounts which have been drawn by the recipient and what amounts remain. Under the \nFAA  between Citibank and  Treasury, Citibank  agreed to  assume this  ministerial funding \nresponsibility. See FAA at Ex. A § I. EPA’s oversight functions remain identical under the FAA \nand under ASAP. This is why the FAA agreement is between Treasury and Citibank, not between \nEPA and Citibank—Citibank is taking over Treasury’s functions, not EPA’s. \n70.  Climate United used the ASAP system to access funds between August 2024 (when \nthe initial NOA was finalized) and November 2024, while the ACA was being finalized. But ASAP \nis far less transparent than the FAA by comparison. ASAP provides only a running total of grant \nfunds disbursed to a  grant recipient—it does not allow  for visibility into the activities of \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 23 of 62\n \nsubrecipients. Therefore, the financial agent arrangement increases EPA’s oversight of funds by \nrequiring Climate United and its subrecipients to disclose expenditures by budget category in real \ntime. The financial agent arrangement also provides EPA with full visibility into any program \nincome generated by Climate United or any subrecipient, which is typically opaque to EPA under \nthe ASAP system.  \nE.  The Account Control Agreement Between Climate United, EPA, and \nCitibank. \n \n71.  The grant agreement required Climate United to enter into an Account Control \nAgreement. Climate United entered into the ACA with EPA and Citibank on November 1, 2024. \nClimate United, EPA, and Citibank executed an amendment on January 13, 2025, to clarify the \nparties’ intent regarding the treatment of certain obligations that were “properly incurred,” if EPA \nissued a Notice of Exclusive Control [hereinafter “Amended ACA”]. This was only a clarification \nand did not alter the substance of the ACA.  \n72.  Under the ACA, Citibank administers the funds provided under the NCIF, in its \nrole “as a  financial agent of the United States  pursuant to  the authority” of the Treasury \nDepartment, and EPA serves as the “Secured Party.” ACA at 1. \n73.  The ACA specifies that Citibank’s duties with respect to the funding are exclusively \n“administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary in nature).” ACA at 3. \nThe ACA further specifies that Citibank “shall not be responsible for any of the agreements \nreferred to or described herein (including, without limitation, the Grant Agreement …), or for \ndetermining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby.” Id.  \n74.  Under the ACA, Citibank is required to disburse funds to Climate United upon \nClimate United’s request. ACA § 2 provides that Citibank “shall comply with all instructions, \nnotifications, and entitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 24 of 62\n \nfinancial assets in the Accounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of \nany such transfer or redemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts.” \n75.  Citibank is not required to disburse funds to Climate United if EPA exercises its \n“right to exclusive control” under the ACA. ACA § 2; see also Amended ACA § 1 (amending \nACA § 2 to clarify that “after the delivery of a Notice of Exclusive Control, Bank shall continue \nto disburse funds and financial assets associated with financial obligations ‘properly incurred’ by \nthe Pledgor prior to the issuance of, but not in anticipation of, a delivery of a Notice of Exclusive \nControl … except for any specific funds or financial assets, identified by Secured Party in the \napplicable Notice of Exclusive Control as not being ‘properly incurred’ by the Pledgor in \naccordance with 2 [C.F.R. §] 200.343.”). \n76.  To exercise its right of control, EPA must notify Citibank of its intention to exercise \nexclusive control over the accounts, in a form substantially similar to a sample Notice of Exclusive \nControl contained in the ACA. Id.; Amended ACA at 10 (Exhibit A: Sample NOEC); see also \nACA at 1 (stating that Climate United and EPA “have agreed that the terms and conditions entitled \n‘Deposit Account at Financial Agent’ in the Grant Agreement indicate the conditions under which \nthe [EPA] may exercise its right of control”). \n77.  The operative form Notice of Exclusive Control states: “As required by the Grant \nAgreement, the Secured Party [i.e., EPA] has issued a written determination and finding that \nPledgor [i.e., Climate United] has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement, and that noncompliance is substantial such that effective performance of the Grant \nAgreement is Materially Impaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse (as \ndefined in the Grant Agreement) or material misrepresentation of eligibility status, and that the \nSecured Party has initiated action under 2 [C.F.R. §] 200.339 to wholly or partly suspend or \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 25 of 62\n \nterminate the Grant Agreement, as authorized in the terms of the Grant Agreement.” Amended \nACA at 10.  \n78.  The form NOEC thus incorporates the standard for termination of the award \nspecified under the Terms and Conditions. Compare id., with December NOA at 41 (discussing \ntermination  under programmatic  conditions) and  January NOA  at  5  (“All  Programmatic \nConditions Remain the Same”). \n79.  The ACA does not refer to the FAA or purport to incorporate by reference any of \nthe FAA’s terms.  \n80.  The ACA does not provide that Citibank may decline to disburse funds to Climate \nUnited under the ACA if such disbursement is not in accordance with the FAA. To the contrary, \nthe ACA states that “[e]ach of the Pledgor [i.e., Climate United] and the Secured Party [i.e., EPA] \nacknowledges and agrees that … the duties, responsibilities and obligations of the Bank shall be \nlimited  to  those expressly set  forth in  this  Agreement [i.e., the  ACA],  each of which is \nadministrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed to be fiduciary in nature).” ACA § 6(a). \nThe ACA further states: “The Bank shall be entitled to rely upon any instruction, notice, request \nor other instrument delivered to it without being required to determine the authenticity or validity \nthereof, or the truth or accuracy of any information stated therein.” ACA § 6(b). In addition, the \nACA states that it “constitutes the entire agreement between the parties and sets forth in its entirety \nthe obligations and duties of the Bank with respect to the assets in the Accounts.” ACA § 9. \nF.  Climate United Uses Grant Funds Provided By Citibank In The Normal \nCourse. \n \n81.  Climate United’s funds were fully obligated by EPA on August 8, 2024. Climate \nUnited initially accessed funds through Treasury’s ASAP system as Treasury worked to implement \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 26 of 62\n \nthe financial agent arrangement. The remainder of Climate United’s undrawn funding was \ndisbursed to accounts held at Citibank, after those accounts were established, subject to the ACA.  \n82.  Thereafter, Climate United drew money from its Citibank accounts approximately \nonce every two weeks to pay operating expenses, as permitted by the governing Terms and \nConditions, which requires prior approval for drawing of transfers that will not be disbursed in the \nfollowing fourteen business days. See December NOA at 57-58.  \n83.  Climate United has used grant funds for salaries and benefits for 37 employees on \nits payroll. These staff members collectively operate all aspects of Climate United’s operations, \nincluding establishing financing programs, underwriting potential financial transactions, ensuring \ncompliance with the Terms and Conditions of the NCIF Award, soliciting and selecting partners, \nconducting community engagement, and structuring and servicing a portfolio of loans.  \n84.  Climate United has used grant funds to launch three financing programs to date. \nThe first is a $31.8 million pre-construction loan to support solar power projects across rural \ncommunities in Arkansas, which was announced in October 2024. Through this project, Climate \nUnited is financing pre-construction costs for 18 solar projects comprising the largest commercial \nand industrial solar deployment in Arkansas history, which is projected to save more than $120 \nmillion in energy costs over the project’s life and create hundreds of jobs.  \n85.  The second is a program to offer affordable leasing options for battery electric \nheavy-duty trucks to small fleets and independent operators. Climate United issued a request for \nproposals in October 2024 from qualified U.S. auto manufacturers to deliver up to 500 electric \ndrayage trucks, which Climate United intends to begin leasing at the ports of Long Beach and Los \nAngeles. When completed, these orders will represent some of the largest-ever purchases of \ndomestically manufactured battery electric trucks in U.S. history. Climate United intends to \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 27 of 62\n \nexpand this program nationally. This program will not only reduce the cost per mile of operating \ndrayage trucks for small businesses, but it will also reduce air pollution in port communities and \ncreate demand for U.S. manufacturing in factories across the country.  \n86.  The third is $63 million in committed pre-construction financing for projects to \ndesign and develop solar power plants in partnership with Tribal governments and communities. \nThese projects bring access to affordable energy to rural communities and Indigenous people in \naddition to quality jobs and local economic development. Initial projects will be located in Eastern \nOregon and Idaho.  \n87.  In addition, Climate United has used grant funds to design, develop and launch the \nClimate United NEXT program. This is a pre-development grant program intended to provide up \nto $30 million in technical assistance and planning support for community-led projects that \nincrease energy independence and resiliency, reduce pollution, and save money for families, small \nbusinesses, and communities. The first round of grants  focused on projects serving Tribal \ncommunities. Climate United publicly committed to announcing pre-development grants through \nthe NEXT program across the United States by the end of February 2025. After reviewing 104 \napplications for the program in the first round of submissions, Climate United approved 22 awards \nacross 18 states, and anticipates issuing $6.345 million in initial subawards.  \n88.  Throughout this period, EPA has exercised its oversight and supervisory authority \nin the following ways: \na.  The terms of the grant agreement require quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports \nto be submitted to EPA, detailing Climate United’s transactions, activities, progress \nagainst its workplan, and expenditures by budget category, including mandatory \nquarterly conflict-of-interest reporting by each of the Climate United coalition \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 28 of 62\n \npartners and Climate United’s subgrantees. Climate United’s inaugural semi-\nannual report covering the period from the start of the grant to December 31, 2024 \nis publicly available; \nb.  EPA has held meetings at least weekly, and frequently two to three times a week, \nto discuss Climate United’s program plans, reporting, oversight, and application of \nthe EPA Terms and Conditions; \nc.  EPA has view access to each of Climate United’s seven Citibank accounts and each \nof the fourteen accounts of Climate United’s subrecipients, allowing EPA to see \nfunds being spent and what budget category that spending relates to, as well as \nallowing EPA to see program income in the form of portfolio earnings or repayment \nof loans; \nd.  Climate United is required to provide a certification each time it submits a draw \nrequest to Citibank for a financial assistance transaction establishing that the draw \nis necessary to execute against its EPA-approved workplan. The certification states: \n“The amount of the transfer is necessary to execute against the EPA-approved \nworkplan,  and  the  financing  agreements  for  identified  qualified  projects \nnecessitating the transfer have been reviewed by Climate United’s counsel for legal \nsufficiency. This certification is a material representation for the purposes of an \nEPA financial Assistance Agreement and knowing and willful false statements may \nbe subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil \nand administrative sanctions.”; \ne.  Climate United was required to obtain EPA approval for a detailed budget for the \nterm of its award, and EPA must approve any material changes; \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 29 of 62\n \nf.  Climate United has adopted detailed policies as  required by EPA,  including \ninvestment policies and procedures to approve projects, many of which require \nfurther reporting from project borrowers; \ng.  Climate United is subject to standard audit requirements by a third-party auditor, \nincluding both financial audits and a Single Audit for federal grant compliance; and \nh.  In  November,  EPA  conducted  transaction  testing,  which  is  a  systematic \nexamination and verification of financial transactions to ensure they comply with \nthe grant's terms, conditions, and applicable regulations. EPA  recently issued \nadditional oversight requests. \nG.  EPA Takes Actions to Attempt to Suspend or Terminate Climate United’s \nGrant, and to Cause Citibank to Not Disburse Climate United’s Funds, \nWhile Ignoring Climate United’s Requests for Information. \n \n89.  On January 30, 2025, Administrator Zeldin was sworn in as the EPA Administrator.  \n90.  On February 12, 2025, Administrator Zeldin made a public statement announcing \nEPA’s goal of taking possession of grant funds disbursed pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act, \nreferring to Climate United by name.7 Without mentioning any specific basis for adverse action \nunder the terms of Climate United’s award—or that of any other recipient—Administrator Zeldin \nstated that “the financial agent agreement with the Bank needs to be instantly terminated,” and \nstated that “the Bank must immediately return” the grant funds.8 To ensure EPA “reassume[s] \nresponsibility for all of these funds,” Administrator Zeldin then stated that he would “refer[] this \n \n7 Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X, at 1:40 (Feb. 12, 2025, 7:52 PM), https://x.com/epaleezeldin/\nstatus/1889840040622321778. \n8 Id. at 2:15. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 30 of 62\n \nmatter to the Inspector General’s Office and will work with the Justice Department,” and that EPA \nis “not going to rest” until it has “recover[ed]” the grant funds.9 \n91.  EPA,  acting  directly and through other government officials, thereafter took \nmultiple actions designed to cause Citibank to withhold grant funds from Climate United. Those \nactions include, but are not limited to: \na.  On February 17, 2025, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”) at the \nDepartment of Justice communicated with the United States Attorney’s Office in \nWashington, D.C. (“USAO-DC”), seeking to open a grand jury investigation into \ngrants awarded by EPA under the GGRF, including to Climate United.10 Denise \nCheung, the Chief of the Criminal Division at USAO-DC, after reviewing the \ndocumentation provided by ODAG, advised that there was not an adequate factual \nbasis to open that grand jury investigation.11  \nb.  On February 17, 2025, FBI “recommended” that Citibank freeze assets in the \naccounts of Climate United and every other prime recipient of a GGRF grant.12 FBI \ndid not refer to the FAA between Citibank and Treasury, or any obligations under \nthe FAA.

FBI  did  not  identify any  substantive factual basis  for this \n“recommendation.” FBI took this action even though Ms. Cheung had advised that \nthere was not “sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to \nseize the particular accounts identified.”13  \nc.  That same day, the ODAG instructed that a second letter be sent to Citibank \ndirecting that Citibank implement an asset freeze and refrain from releasing funds \nin accounts of 28 other GGRF awardees and subawardees pursuant to a criminal \ninvestigation.14 In response, senior officials at the DC-USAO again asserted there \nwas not sufficient evidence to justify issuing that letter.15 Consistent with her oath \nof office, Ms. Cheung refused to send the letter and was forced to resign on \nFebruary 18, 2025.16  \nd.  Apparently without signoff from other prosecutors at the DC-USAO, Interim U.S. \nAttorney Ed Martin submitted a seizure warrant application with a magistrate \njudge, which was rejected.17 After that, ODAG reportedly sought a different U.S. \nattorney’s office to carry out the warrant request in order to launch a grand jury \ninvestigation and obtain a court-ordered bank freeze, but prosecutors in that office \nlikewise refused to do so.18 \n \n13 Resignation Letter, supra note 10. \n14 Id.; see Dkt. 14-5 at 5-6. \n15 Resignation Letter, supra note 10.  \n16 Id. \n17 Spencer Hsu, Maxine Joselow & Nicolas Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe Amid Pushback \nfrom Judge, Prosecutors, Wash.

On February 19, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated on X that he had “just read” a \n“grant agreement” related to the GGRF, characterizing it as “wild.”19  \nf.  On February 23, 2025, Administrator Zeldin discussed the GGRF program on \nnational television and stated, without basis, that “the entire scheme, in my opinion, \nis criminal.”20 \ng.  On March 2, 2025, EPA Deputy Administrator McIntosh sent a letter to EPA’s \nOffice of the Inspector General asking for an OIG investigation into GGRF \nfunding.21 That letter, which was public, states that Citibank was withholding the \nfunds “voluntarily.” The letter did not disclose FBI’s “recommendation” to freeze \nthe funds or EPA’s role in procuring that “recommendation.”   \nh.  EPA then sent a copy of that letter to Citibank by email, asserting that the letter \n“highlights several of the egregious instances of misconduct regarding $20 billion \nGGRF distributions that have been improperly funneled through your financial \ninstitution,” and  stating  that  “EPA  will  continue our  efforts to  re-establish \naccountability and oversight over the GGRF, which is riddled with self-dealing, \nconflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients, improperly reduced \ngovernment oversight, and much more.”22 Beyond these generalized statements, \n \n19 Lee Zeldin (@EPALeeZeldin), X (Feb. 19, 2025, 4:01 PM), https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/\n1892318587961930086. \n20  Sunday  Morning  Futures  (@SundayMorningFutures), X  (Feb.  23,  2025,  11:21  AM), \nhttps://x.com/SundayFutures/status/1893697750937505807; see  also Zack Colman, Recipient \nIsn’t Giving in as Trump’s EPA  Tries to Revoke Climate Grants, Politico (Feb. 24, 2025), \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/climate-grant-recipient-spending-trumps-epa-tries-\nclaw-back-00205814 (collecting quotes). \n21 EPA Formally Refers Financial Mismanagement of $20B “Gold Bars” to Inspector General, \nEPA (last updated Mar. 3, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-formally-refers-financial\n-mismanagement-20b-gold-bars-inspector-general. \n22 Dkt. 14-6. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 33 of 62\n \nthe communication to Citibank offers no basis for its assertions of “conflicts of \ninterest,  extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients,”  or  “improperly  reduced \ngovernment oversight” with respect to Climate United.  \ni.  On March 4, 2025, after EPA received a letter from Climate United outlining the \nlegal and factual basis for  why access to  its  funding must be restored, the \nDepartment of Treasury directed Citibank not to disburse funds from any of the \nGGRF accounts for a specified period.” Dkt. 14 at 7. In an email to Citibank at \n10:02 PM, Treasury stated that “Treasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as \nfiduciary, to work directly with the EPA to establish and implement reasonable \naccount controls to serve the purposes and interests of the United States, in \naccordance with Section 5 of the FAA. Further, in order to provide the EPA with \nthe  necessary time  to  develop reasonable account controls,  we  are  further \ninstructing Citibank not to disburse funds from any of the GGRF accounts prior to \nthe end of the day Sunday, March 9, 2025.” Dkt. 14-7. Neither the ACA nor the \nFAA permit such a direction based on vague and unfounded suspicions. The FAA \nonly permits Citibank to freeze funds “in accordance with the account control \nagreements,” but the ACA did not permit this freeze. The FAA requires Citibank \nto comply with “all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury,” but \nthe instructions on March 4 and 10 were not lawful. Citibank’s role as a fiduciary \nof the United States does not extend to suborning unlawful conduct by EPA or \nTreasury.  \nj.  On March 8, 2025, EPA sent Citibank a letter regarding GGRF grant recipients. \nSee Dkt. 14-2. On information and belief, that communication directed Citibank to \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 34 of 62\n \n“not resume processing payment instructions for GGRF accounts,” Dkt. 14-2, or \nlanguage to that effect.  \nk.  On March 10, 2025, in an email to Citibank with the timestamp of 12:28 AM \neastern time,  EPA  directed Citibank to  continue to  refrain from processing \npayments. Dkt. 14 at 7. The message stated: “In its communication to the Bank this \nweek, the U.S.  Department of the Treasury (Treasury) directed the Bank to \ncooperate with EPA on account controls. To prevent the misuse of funds in the \ninterim, EPA instructs the Bank, pursuant to this Treasury directive, the grant \nagreements, and Section I.B of Exhibit A to the [FAA], to pause the processing of \npayment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice.” Dkt. 14-2. This \ndirection was also illegal: Section I.B of Exhibit A to the FAA did not permit \nTreasury to take this step unless the grant was lawfully terminated. As of March \n10, the grant had not been terminated and no termination would have been lawful.  \n92.  Amid these events, Citibank failed to comply with Climate United’s normal-course \nrequests for disbursements, as required by the ACA. When Climate United inquired, Citibank did \nnot respond and did not provide Climate United with any legal or factual basis for its failure to act.  \na.  On February 14, 2025, Climate United requested an inter-account transfer, to move \nfunds related to the purchase of electric trucks from Climate United’s budget \naccount to Climate United’s reserve account. The transfer did not occur. \nb.   On February 18, 2025, Climate United placed a request to Citibank to draw funds \nfrom Climate United’s account. In the normal course, Citibank would have sold \nshares in Climate United’s money market account, and then distributed the resulting \nfunds to Climate United later that same day. But Climate United’s accounts with \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 35 of 62\n \nCitibank do not reflect that the typical money market transaction or disbursement \noccurred, and Climate United did not receive any funds from its account.  \nc.  On the morning of February 19, 2025, Climate United submitted an email message \nto Citibank noting that its funding requests remained pending and had not been \ndisbursed. That letter requested that Citibank provide the legal bases for those \nactions, advise whether those actions were taken pursuant to a directive by a \ngovernment agency, and provide a reasonable opportunity to respond to any \ninstruction or request that impacts Climate United’s accounts before that instruction \nor request may be acted upon by Citibank. Citibank did not respond.  \nd.  On February 21, 2025, Climate United placed a request to Citibank to draw funds \nfrom Climate United’s account. But Climate United’s accounts with Citibank do \nnot reflect that the typical money market transaction or disbursement occurred, and \nClimate United did not receive any funds from its account.  \ne.  On the evening of February 25, 2025, counsel for Climate United submitted another \nemail message to Citibank requesting release of the funds within 24 hours or, in the \nalternative, to provide the legal bases for its actions. Citibank again did not respond.  \nf.  On February 26, 2025, counsel left voicemail messages for Citibank. Citibank again \ndid not respond.  \ng.  On March 1, 2025, counsel submitted a letter in hard copy and by email to the Chief \nExecutive and Chief Legal Officers of Citibank. The letter explained that Citibank \nis illegally withholding Climate United’s funds in breach of the ACA; has ignored \nClimate United’s repeated requests for information by phone, voicemail, and email; \nand has failed to provide any colorable legal basis for Citibank’s actions. The letter \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 36 of 62\n \ndemanded a response by no later than close of business on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. \nCitibank did not respond.  \n93.  When Citibank finally responded to Climate United, Citibank stated that it was not \ndisbursing funds because it was waiting for direction from EPA. Citibank did not disclose that it \nhad frozen Climate United’s funds based on FBI’s “recommendation” or based on direction from \nEPA and Treasury. \na.  On  March 3,  2025, Climate  United contacted Citibank by  email  requesting \ninformation about the status  of Climate  United’s funds and the process for \ndisbursing  those  funds.  Citibank  responded:  “We  have  received  your \ncorrespondence and  have forwarded it  to  the  United  States  Environmental \nProtection Agency and other federal officials for an appropriate response. … Once \nwe have further information available regarding the program we can provide at that \ntime.”  In  response  to  a  follow-up  email  from  Climate  United  requesting \nclarification, Citibank stated: “We are awaiting further guidance.”  \nb.  On March 4, 2025, in “a statement emailed to Newsweek … , a spokesperson for \nCitibank said Citi has been working with federal officials to ‘address government \nofficials’ concerns’ regarding the GGRF. ‘Our role as financial agent does not \ninvolve any discretion over which organizations receive grant funds,’ the bank said \nin its statement. ‘Citi will of course comply with any binding instructions from the \nfederal government.’”23  \n \n23 Jeff Young, Green Group Wants EPA to Explain Why $20 Billion Accounts Are Frozen, \nNewsweek (Mar.  4, 2025), https://www.newsweek.com/climate-united-fund-epa-letter-frozen-\nbank-accounts-2039608. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 37 of 62\n \n94.  Citibank’s communications with Climate United and its public statements were \nmisleading. Citibank did not assert that it was obligated under the FAA to freeze Climate United’s \nfunds. Citibank did not mention that EPA and Treasury had illegally caused Citibank to freeze \nClimate United’s funds. Citibank did not state or suggest that it was withholding funds from \nClimate United based on a “recommendation” from FBI that cited no evidence and was not \naccompanied by a court order supported by probable cause and a sworn affidavit.  \n95.  Citibank also never described EPA’s and Treasury’s stated bases for withholding \nClimate  United’s  funds. For  example, Citibank  never  informed Climate  United  that  the \ncommunications recommending or directing Citibank not to disburse funds to Climate United \nsolely cited the FAA (to which Climate United is not a party), did not cite the ACA, did not assert \nthat termination was warranted under the ACA, and did not suggest that a Notice of Exclusive \nControl had been issued or would be forthcoming. Citibank also never informed Climate United \nthat the communications recommending or directing Citibank not to disburse Climate United’s \nfunds did not proffer adequate, let alone credible, evidence that any of the ACA’s three bases for \nterminating Climate United’s grant had been satisfied. And Citibank never gave Climate United \nan opportunity to respond. So Climate United never had an opportunity to explain that the FAA \nonly permits accounts to be frozen “in accordance with the account control agreements,” and that \nthe ACA did not permit Climate United’s assets to be frozen under these circumstances. Climate \nUnited also never had an opportunity to point out that the FAA requires Citibank to comply with \n“lawful instructions or directions” and act as a fiduciary, which did not require complying with the \nunlawful instructions and direction given by FBI, EPA, and Treasury. Instead, Citibank waited to \nreveal the truth until March 12—nearly a month after it began withholding Climate United’s grant \nfunds, and with Climate United on the brink of suffering irreparable harm. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 38 of 62\n \n96.  For its part, EPA never informed Climate United that EPA had been trying to \nfreeze, suspend, or terminate Climate United’s grant or its access to grant funds, or that EPA had \ndirected Citibank to stop disbursing funds to Climate United. EPA never provided Climate United \nwith a reasoned explanation, or any explanation, for its actions. EPA never even responded to \nClimate United’s communications—even while EPA was simultaneously pressing Citibank to \ncontinue to prevent Climate United from accessing its funds, and directing Treasury to order \nCitibank to withhold Climate United’s funds. Indeed, Climate United was not notified of these \nevents until March 12, 2025, when it was served with briefs responding to its motion for a TRO. \na.  On February 20, 2025, Climate United sent an email message to officials at EPA \nnotifying EPA that it was being denied access to its funds and requesting additional \ninformation and guidance. The EPA team replied on February 21, providing no \nadditional information but offering to discuss the following week. The following \nweek, however, EPA rescheduled the meeting three times. After being informed \nthat Climate United’s outside counsel would be present at the meeting, an EPA \nofficial cancelled the meeting without rescheduling.  \nb.  Climate United subsequently called the EPA official on February 27. The official’s \nadministrative assistant responded that the official was in possession of Climate \nUnited’s e-mails and would reach out. As of the date of this filing, Climate United \nis still awaiting a response.  \nc.  On March 4, 2025, Climate United submitted a letter to EPA by email, notifying \nEPA that Climate United has been unable to access its funding and requesting \ninformation regarding the nature of and legal justification for EPA’s actions. The \nletter requested that EPA immediately reverse its actions and reinstate Climate \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 39 of 62\n \nUnited’s access to its NCIF funding. In the alternative, the letter requested that EPA \nrescind or stay any suspension of termination of Climate United’s grant pending \njudicial review. EPA did not respond. \nd.  On March 8, 2025, Climate United sued EPA after EPA had failed to respond to \nearlier communications. Counsel for Climate United served Citibank and EPA by \nemail with a copy of the complaint and informed them that Climate United intended \nto file a motion for a Temporary Restraining Order at the opening of business on \nMonday, March 10, 2025. EPA did not respond.  \nH.  EPA Files A Purported “Notice of Termination” \n \n97.  On March 10, 2025, Climate United moved for a TRO that would have, among \nother things, enjoined EPA from “unlawfully suspending or terminated Climate United’s grant \naward except as is permitted in accordance with the Account Control Agreement, the grant award, \nand applicable law.” Dkt. 2 at 2. The Court tentatively scheduled a hearing for March 11, 2025, at \n4:00 PM. The government’s attorney requested a 24-hour extension as a purported “courtesy.” \nClimate United consented. \n98.  On March 11, 2025, at approximately 6:22 PM—after the originally scheduled time \nfor the TRO hearing—EPA did precisely what Climate United was seeking to restrain EPA from \ndoing at the TRO hearing: it terminated Climate United’s grant award in a manner that violated \nthe ACA, the grant award, and applicable law. At the TRO hearing, EPA then used the purported \ntermination as a basis for arguing that the case was moot. \n99.  Specifically, after business hours on March 11, 2025, EPA served what it described \nas a “Notice of Termination” (“Notice”). Dkt. 13-1. The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating \nClimate United’s grant “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] authority under 2 C.F.R. §[ ] 200.339.” 2 C.F.R. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 40 of 62\n \n§ 200.339 applies only when “the recipient … fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal \nstatutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award.” EPA’s “Notice” does not offer \nany evidence that Climate United violated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, term, \nor condition of the grant.  \n100.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s]  authority under … 2 C.F.R.  §§ 200.340.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, which is  the only \ntermination authority mentioned in EPA’s General Terms and Conditions for grants, permits \ntermination “[b]y the Federal agency … if the recipient … fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award” or “[b]y the Federal agency … pursuant to the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award ….” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA’s “Notice” does not \noffer any evidence that Climate United has failed to comply with any Terms and Conditions of its \ngrant.  \n101.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s]  authority under …  the  General Terms  and Conditions of EPA  assistance award \nagreements.” EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any evidence that Climate United has failed to comply \nwith any General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements. \n102.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s]  authority under … the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement.” The Grant \nAgreement specifies that termination may occur only in three situations: (1) noncompliance with \nthe grant’s Terms and Conditions; (2) “adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which in \nturn requires “credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving \nfraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 41 of 62\n \nor a violation of the civil False Claims Act”; and (3) “material misrepresentation of eligibility \nstatus.” EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any evidence that any of these three situations has occurred.  \n103.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant “[p]ursuant \nto …  the  Agency’s  inherent authority to  reconsider prior  determinations in  light  of new \ninformation.” EPA’s “Notice” does not identify the source of such inherent authority or any new \ninformation to support reconsidering the prior determination to award the grant to Climate United \nless than one year ago. \n104.  The “Notice” states that the “termination is based on substantial concerns regarding \nprogram integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment \nwith the Agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory \nobjectives of the award.” EPA’s  “Notice” does not identify any legal  or factual basis for \nterminating the grant on these grounds. \n105.  The “Notice” states that EPA has identified certain deficiencies, such as “the \nabsence of adequate oversight and account controls,” “allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s \noversight and fiscal responsibilities,” and the  “circumvention and defeat of key oversight \nmechanisms.” EPA’s “Notice” does not substantiate these concerns or identify any legal or factual \nbasis for terminating the grant on these grounds. \n106.  The “Notice” asserts that  EPA  has “determined that its  existing  process for \nawarding and overseeing execution of the Grant Agreement” may violate the “Appointments \nClause and private nondelegation doctrine.” EPA’s “Notice” does not explain any legal or factual \nbasis for terminating the grant on these grounds. Indeed, neither the Appointments Clause nor the \nprivate nondelegation doctrine is implicated by this grant agreement. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 42 of 62\n \n107.  By press release dated March 11, 2025, EPA confirmed that it had “notified \nNational Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the \ntermination of their grant agreements.”24   \nI.  Citibank and EPA’s Actions Have Harmed Climate United. \n \n108.  The NCIF award is currently the basis of funding for all of Climate United’s \noperations and for all financing projects that Climate United either has launched or is planning to \nlaunch, aside from emergency charitable grants (which Climate United must pay back if funding \nis restored) to support operations while NCIF funds are unavailable. Even temporary inability to \naccess its funding immediately threatens Climate United’s operations, its ongoing and future \nprojects, and its long-term reputation. \n109.  Other than stopgap emergency charitable grants, which Climate United will need \nto repay if its access to funding is restored, Climate United does not have other committed sources \nof funding to replace the NCIF award. Nor is private investment a viable replacement. In fact, \nClimate United was specifically awarded NCIF funding to “prioritize investment in qualified \nprojects that would otherwise lack access to financing.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(b)(1)(B). \n110.  Without another source of funding aside from stopgap emergency charitable grants, \nClimate United does not have funds to pay operating expenses. Without that funding, Climate \nUnited also will not be able to pay its employees, pay rent, pay critical service providers and \ncontractors, or meet its commitments under the loans and awards it has already approved. As a \nresult of Defendants’ actions, to preserve its available cash Climate United has already been \ncompelled to defer compensation for certain employees, slash staff salaries, terminate multiple \n \n24 See Press Release, EPA, Administrator Zeldin Terminates Biden-Harris $20B ‘Gold Bar’ Grants \n(Mar. 11, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-terminates-biden-harris-\n20b-gold-bar-grants. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 43 of 62\n \nvendors, cancel travel, and instruct non-essential lawyers, accountants, and consultants to cease \nwork.  \n111.  The  work  of  Climate  United  is  highly  specialized.  It  structures  financial \ntransactions in hard-to-finance markets, which requires a deep understanding of various capital \nsources, including government programs (e.g., low-income housing tax credits, solar investment \ntax credits, etc.) and private investors (e.g., banks and insurance companies). Structuring and \nunderwriting these transactions requires experience in the private credit markets to assess expected \nand unexpected risks based on prior knowledge of similar transactions, market data, and industry \ndynamics. To  execute on  this  program,  Climate  United  has  hired  a  team  of investment \nprofessionals with  expertise  in  credit  underwriting,  structuring,  and  asset  management—\nfrequently from other financial institutions where they had higher compensation, on the promise \nof being able to serve Climate United’s mission and the impact on the communities that benefit \nfrom Climate United’s projects. If Climate United is unable to pay its staff, they are likely to leave \nand find other employment. Climate United has spent over two years cultivating relationships to \ndevelop its pipeline of bespoke transactions specifically tailored for this award; the departure of \nexisting Climate United staff would irreparably harm Climate United’s ability to fulfill its mission \nand workplan. \n112.  Continuing uncertainty around Climate United’s funding has caused Climate \nUnited to confront increasingly unfavorable terms from essential vendors and prospective deal \npartners, some of whom have explicitly said they are unwilling to do deals with Climate United \nwhile its funds are frozen. Climate United also imminently risks not being able to pay rent and \ninsurance for select offices or to pay critical third-party contractors who perform necessary \nservices such as managing accounts payable, auditing financial statements, maintaining IT security \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 44 of 62\n \nand infrastructure, advising on compliance, supporting communications, and providing legal \nservices.  \n113.  Continued uncertainty over Climate United’s funding and inability to meet its \nexisting commitments will have a devastating effect on Climate United’s reputation. Climate \nUnited is primarily a lender, and borrowers who are uncertain about Climate United’s sustained \nability to deliver on funding commitments would not be willing to partner with Climate United to \nfinance infrastructure projects. Climate United’s loans typically disburse over a series of months \nor years and security of funding is paramount, in particular because many of the Climate United \ncoalition’s projects are construction projects. \n114.  Climate United has already heard from both borrowers and prospective financing \npartners about the impact Defendants’ actions are having on their decision-making. One existing \npartner responded to Climate United’s latest Request for Proposals to support community lenders \nwith asset purchases by saying it was “not allocating resources to this RFP at the present moment \nas [it] monitor[s] the NCIF situation and look[s] for resolution of some of the uncertainty.” A \nmanufacturer informed Climate United: “given the status of the current environment, we are going \nto pause any engagement with Climate United until the relationship between Climate United and \nthe EPA is stable and we can be more confident that funds will not be clawed back.” \n115.  Further, without a source of funding, Climate United would not be able to meet its \ncommitments under the loans and awards it has already approved. This could render Climate \nUnited in  breach of its  existing  agreements and would cause profound harm to the  local \norganizations who rely on these funds to develop critical energy projects that reduce costs and \ncreate jobs. As examples, Climate United will be unable to support the worthwhile projects \ndescribed above—including the solar projects in Arkansas, the project to develop and lease electric \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 45 of 62\n \nheavy-duty drayage trucks in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the projects to design and \ndevelop solar power plants in partnership with Tribal governments and communities in Eastern \nOregon and Idaho, and the 22 Tribal projects across 18 states as part of the NEXT program.  \n116.  If Climate United is unable to carry out its projects, it will harm the communities \nacross the country that it was awarded the NCIF grant to serve. The following are examples of \nsome of the negative impacts on U.S. businesses and consumers, as estimated in Climate United’s \nEPA-approved workplan:  \na.  10,000 households would not get solar systems on their roofs, of which 60% \nare families living in low-to-moderate-income communities. This would result \nin a total annual loss to low-to-moderate-income consumers of $8.8 million \nannually. The total lifetime loss to consumers is estimated at nearly $100 \nmillion. \nb.  11 solar power plants in  Arkansas would not be  built, which would be \nequivalent to  $120 million  in  energy  savings not  realized for  Arkansas \ntaxpayers. In addition, 1,500 jobs, primarily in skilled trades, would not be \ncreated or preserved. \nc.

In addition, if Climate United’s investment portfolio stalls, it will not be able to \ninvest in programs and technologies that will reduce or avoid 11 million MT CO2e, bring economic \nbenefits to millions of Americans, and mobilize at least $21 billion in private capital, benefiting \nconsumers and businesses in the areas of housing, passenger and heavy-duty vehicles, and \ncommercial and community buildings. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS  \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n   \n118.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n119.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary” or “capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n120.  On March 11, 2025, EPA  purported to terminate Climate United’s grant  by \ndelivering a “Notice of Termination.”  \n121.  EPA’s termination of Climate United’s grant constitutes final agency action under \nthe APA. \n122.  EPA’s termination of Climate United’s grant is arbitrary and capricious because \nEPA had no legal or factual basis for the termination and EPA did not provide an adequate or \nreasoned basis for the termination.  \na.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s] authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40, the General Terms and Conditions \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 47 of 62\n \nof EPA  assistance award agreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement, and the Agency's inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations \nin light of new information.” But EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any evidence or \nexplanation to support termination on those grounds. Indeed, there is no legal or \nfactual basis for termination on any of those grounds. Climate United has not \nviolated any constitutional provision, statute, or regulation; has not failed to comply \nwith any Terms or Conditions of its grant; has not failed to comply with any General \nTerms and Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements; has not engaged in \n“Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined as “the commission of a violation of \nFederal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity \nviolations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil \nFalse Claims Act”; and has not triggered any of the grounds for termination under \nthe Terms and Conditions of its grant.  \nb.  EPA’s “Notice” does not identify the source of any inherent authority to terminate \nthe grant; does not identify any new information to support reconsidering the prior \ndetermination to award the grant to Climate United less than one year ago; does not \nidentify any basis to terminate the grant based on concerns about program integrity, \nthe award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, misalignment with the \nAgency’s priorities, or sufficiency of oversight mechanisms or account controls; \nand does not explain any legal or factual basis for terminating the grant based on \nthe Appointments Clause or the private nondelegation doctrine. \nc.  EPA’s termination reflects an arbitrary and capricious change in position. EPA has \nprovided no reasoned explanation for its decision to terminate Climate United’s \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 48 of 62\n \ngrant on March 11, 2025, when the grant was awarded in April 2024, following \nmonths of rigorous review as part of a competitive application process.  \nd.  EPA’s “Notice” provides no explanation for its abrupt change of position that \naccounts for upsetting the reliance interests of Climate United and its subgrantees. \n123.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n124.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s \ntermination of the grant is arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. \nCOUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT -  \nNOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS  \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n   \n125.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n126.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n127.  On March 11, 2025, EPA  purported to terminate Climate United’s grant  by \ndelivering a “Notice of Termination.”  \n128.  EPA’s termination of Climate United’s grant constitutes final agency action under \nthe APA. \n129.  EPA’s termination of Climate United’s grant is not in accordance with law because \nit violates multiple federal regulations. For example: \na.  EPA’s  termination of the grant violates EPA  regulations and Uniform Grant \nGuidance regulations codified at 2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq., which do not allow EPA to \nterminate Climate United’s grant under these circumstances. \nb.  EPA’s termination of the grant has not complied with EPA’s regulatory obligation \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 49 of 62\n \nto take certain procedural steps to terminate the grant agreement, such as providing \nwritten  notice of termination that  includes “the reasons for termination, the \neffective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a). The Notice only provides vague references to “waste” and \n“accountability,” among other things, with no supporting evidence or facts as to \nwhat Climate United is alleged to have done wrong. \nc.  EPA’s termination of the grant has resulted in improperly withholding payment for \nallowable costs without establishing that Climate United has either “failed to \ncomply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a \ndebt to the United States.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  \nd.  EPA’s termination of the grant has resulted in improperly withholding payment \nwithout first making a “determin[ation] that noncompliance cannot be remedied by \nimposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.339. Although the Notice includes a \nvague reference to “material deficiencies” and asserts that “these deficiencies … \ncannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions,” EPA does not explain these \nstatements or offer facts to support them.  \ne.  EPA’s termination of the grant does not comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b), which \nstates: “The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously \nspecify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.” \nEPA’s termination decision is not grounded in the “terms and conditions of the \nFederal award.” Instead, the termination is based on EPA’s disagreement with the \nGGRF program. \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 50 of 62\n \n130.  Although EPA’s “Notice” states that EPA is terminating Climate United’s grant \n“[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40,” those regulations do not provide \nEPA with grounds to terminate the grant.  \na.  2 C.F.R. § 200.339 applies only when “the recipient … fails to comply with the \nU.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the \nFederal award.” EPA has not provided any reasoned legal or factual basis to \nconclude that Climate United has violated any constitutional provision, statute, \nregulation, or term or condition of the grant. Indeed, Climate United has not \nviolated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or term or condition of the \ngrant.  \nb.  2  C.F.R. §  200.340 permits termination “[b]y the  Federal agency …  if  the \nrecipient … fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or \n“[b]y the Federal agency … pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward ….” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA has not provided any reasoned \nlegal or factual basis to conclude that Climate United has failed to comply with any \nTerms and Conditions of its grant.  \n131.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n132.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s \ntermination of the grant is not in accordance with federal regulations, in violation of the APA. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—\nNOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH INFLATION REDUCTION ACT  \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n   \n133.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 51 of 62\n \n134.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n135.  On March 11, 2025, EPA  purported to terminate Climate United’s grant  by \ndelivering a “Notice of Termination.”  \n136.  EPA’s termination of Climate United’s grant constitutes final agency action under \nthe APA. \n137.  EPA’s termination of the grant violates the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act \nrequires EPA to spend the funds appropriated for grants to be awarded under the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434. EPA violated the Act because it has not satisfied the stringent \nrequirements for rescinding an appropriation under 2 U.S.C. § 683.  \n138.  Even  if  EPA  “re-obligate[s]  lawfully appropriated funds within  the  GGRF \nprogram,” Dkt. 13-1, as EPA claims it will do, EPA’s action would still be illegal. The Inflation \nReduction Act sets a September 30, 2024 deadline for all grants to be awarded. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(a)(1), (2).  Illegally  terminating the  entire program, and then re-awarding grants  to \nunspecified new recipients, is inconsistent with that September 30, 2024 deadline. \n139.  As a result of EPA’s conduct, Climate United has suffered and will continue to \nsuffer irreparable injury.  \n140.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n141.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s \ntermination of the grant is not in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, in violation of the \nAPA. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 52 of 62\n \nCOUNT FOUR: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n(CHALLENGE TO SUSPENSION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n142.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n143.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, … or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n144.  Prior to March 11, 2025, EPA effectuated a suspension of Climate United’s grant \nby causing Citibank to withhold Climate United’s grant funds. \n145.  EPA’s suspension of Climate United’s grant constitutes final agency action under \nthe APA.  \n146.  EPA’s suspension of Climate United’s grant is not in accordance with federal \nregulations, as described above. For example, EPA’s actions resulted in improperly withholding \npayment for allowable costs without establishing that Climate United has either “failed to comply \nwith the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United \nStates.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  \n147.  EPA’s suspension of Climate United’s grant is arbitrary and capricious.  \na.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to open a grand jury investigation into Climate \nUnited’s grant. Indeed, EPA’s efforts to do so caused the Chief of the Criminal \nDivision of the United States Attorneys’ Office in Washington, D.C. to resign from \nthat office after 24 years of service. \nb.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to cause a Freeze Letter to be issued to Citibank, \nor to cause Citibank or Treasury to freeze Climate United’s grant funds, particularly \nwhen the freeze “recommendation” was not supported by an order issued by a judge \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 53 of 62\n \nbased on probable cause and cited no evidence in support of freezing Climate \nUnited’s grant funds.  \nc.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to direct Treasury to demand that Citibank stop \ndisbursing funds. Further, Treasury’s action did not comply with the FAA, which \nstates that any freeze of Climate United’s accounts must occur in accordance with \nthe ACA and must be lawful. \nd.  EPA refused to meet with Climate United, and never responded to Climate United’s \ncommunications about its inability to access its  funds—even while EPA  was \nsimultaneously acting to prevent Climate United from accessing its grant funds.  \n148.  Climate  United continues to experience ongoing injury from the suspension \nbecause during the suspension period it has not received funds to which it is lawfully entitled. \nFurther, even if the termination is enjoined, any suspension that remains in effect would cause \nharm to Climate United. \n149.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n150.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s \nsuspension of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in violation of the \nAPA. \nCOUNT FIVE: VIOLATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n151.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n152.  The Appropriations Clause provides: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, \nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I,§ 9, cl. 7.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 54 of 62\n \n153.  The  provision of the  Inflation Reduction Act  authorizing  the  GGRF  is  an \n“appropriation” because it authorizes EPA to expend $27 billion for purposes of carrying out the \nGGRF program. \n154.  In the Inflation Reduction Act, Congress “appropriated to the [EPA] Administrator \n… $[19],970,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2024, to make grants, on a \ncompetitive basis.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2), (3). The Appropriations Clause therefore forbids EPA \nfrom using appropriated funds to award grants after the statutory deadline.  \n155.  In the “Notice of Termination,” EPA states: “EPA will work to re-obligate lawfully \nappropriated funds within the GGRF program …” Dkt. 13-1. In doing so, EPA seeks to spend \nmoney in a manner Congress has not permitted, in violation of the Appropriations Clause.  \n156.  If EPA re-obligates GGRF’s grant funds to its preferred recipients, EPA would be \nviolating Congress’s intention for the funds to be obligated to clean-energy grants that were \ncompleted prior to September 30, 2024.  \n157.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 327 (2015).25 \n158.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n159.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s \nsuspension and termination of the grant violates the Appropriations Clause. \n \n25 The APA independently authorizes Climate United to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 55 of 62\n \nCOUNT SIX: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n160.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n161.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government may \nnot deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest without due process of law. \n162.  Climate United has a protected property interest in the grant funds it was awarded \nunder the NCIF and in the accounts at Citibank to which those funds were disbursed. \n163.  The government’s actions preceding the termination, up to and including the \ntermination, violated the Due Process Clause. For example:  \na.  EPA caused Citibank to freeze Climate United’s assets without first obtaining a \ncourt order based on probable cause and supported by a sworn affidavit. Indeed, \nEPA initiated the freeze despite a judge having expressly rejected an application \nfor a seizure warrant on the basis that no probable cause existed. \nb.  EPA never informed Climate United that EPA was trying to freeze, suspend, or \nterminate Climate United’s grant or its access to grant funds, or that EPA was \ncoordinating in secret with Treasury and FBI to direct Citibank to stop disbursing \nfunds to Climate United. EPA thus deprived Climate United of its property in the \ngrant funds without providing Climate United notice or an opportunity to be heard \nprior to the initiation of the freeze. \nc.  EPA also failed to provide Climate United notice or an opportunity to challenge the \nfreeze once it had been implemented. After Climate United deduced that its funds \nhad been frozen, EPA refused to respond to Climate United’s multiple requests for \ninformation or to meet with Climate United, and never notified Climate United that \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 56 of 62\n \nits funds had been frozen at EPA’s direction. At the same time—and again without \nproviding Climate United notice of its actions—EPA was continuing to pressure \nCitibank to  keep Climate United from accessing funds in  its  accounts, and \nultimately directed Treasury to order Citibank to withhold Climate United’s funds. \nd.  In an attempt to extend the unlawful freeze of Climate United’s assets in the wake \nof the filing of this litigation, EPA issued the “Notice of Termination” without any \nlegal or factual basis. It offered no notice or process to Climate United before doing \nso; and the “Notice” provides no opportunity for Climate United to challenge the \npurported “termination” of its grant funds after the fact. EPA issued the “Notice” \nhours before a court hearing, which had been extended as a professional courtesy, \ndespite being notified by Climate United days earlier that Climate United had filed \na lawsuit and intended to seek temporary emergency relief.  \n164.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 327 (2015).26 \n165.  EPA’s weekslong effort to deprive Climate United of its property in the grant funds \nviolates the Due Process Clause. Climate United is entitled to an injunction preventing EPA from \ncontinuing to deprive Climate United of access to the funds in its accounts without due process.  \nCOUNT SEVEN: BREACH OF CONTRACT \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n166.  Climate United repeats and incorporates herein by reference each and every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n \n26 The APA independently authorizes Climate United to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 57 of 62\n \n167.  Citibank has a duty under the ACA to disburse Climate United’s grant funds to \nClimate United, as Climate United requests. Under the ACA, Citibank “shall comply with all \ninstructions, notifications, and entitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of \nfunds and financial assets in the Accounts.” ACA at 2. \n168.  When Climate United requested that Citibank disburse grant funds held in Climate \nUnited’s accounts, as required by the ACA, Citibank failed to disburse such funds. \n169.  Citibank has no legal or factual basis for failing to disburse grant funds from \nClimate United’s accounts, as required by the ACA. \n170.  Under the ACA, Citibank’s duties with respect to Climate United’s grant funding \nare exclusively “administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature),” \nand Citibank “shall not be responsible” for determining whether Climate United’s requests for the \ndisbursement of grant funds comply with any applicable contracts or laws. ACA at 3. \n171.  EPA (as the Secured Party under the ACA) has not delivered to Citibank a Notice \nof Exclusive Control and has stated that it has no intention of delivering such a notice to Citibank. \nIndeed, there is no factual basis to support such a notice.  \n172.  EPA has not “issued a written determination and finding that [Climate United] has \nfailed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and that noncompliance \nis substantial such that effective performance of the Grant Agreement is materially impaired or \nthere is adequate evidence of waste, fraud, material misrepresentation of eligibility status, or \nabuse.” ACA Exhibit A. Indeed, there is no factual basis to support such a written determination \nor finding. \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 58 of 62\n \n173.  EPA has not “initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or partly suspend or \nterminate the Grant Agreement, as authorized in the terms of the Grant Agreement.” Indeed, there \nis no factual basis to support such an action.  \n174.  The FAA between Citibank and Treasury, to which Climate United is not a party, \ndoes not provide Citibank with a legal basis to fail to disburse Climate United’s grant funds as \nrequired by the ACA. The FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts … in accordance with” \nthe ACA, and in compliance with “lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.” But \nCitibank froze Climate United’s funds without following the ACA’s termination provisions and \nbased on instructions that were not lawful. And Citibank was not obligated to withhold funds based \non FBI’s “recommendation,” which did not provide any factual or legal basis for freezing the funds \nin Climate United’s accounts. No such basis exists.  \n175.  By failing to disburse grant funds held in Climate United’s accounts, Citibank has \nbreached the ACA. \n176.  Citibank’s failure to disburse funds, as required under the ACA, has caused damage \nto Climate United. Such damage has resulted solely from Citibank’s own gross negligence or \nwillful misconduct. \n177.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that \nCitibank’s failure to disburse funds from Climate United’s accounts is a breach of the ACA. \n178.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful refusal to \nhonor Climate United’s disbursement requests. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 59 of 62\n \nCOUNT EIGHT: REPLEVIN \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n179.

Climate United has an immediate legal right to possess the grant funds that Climate \nUnited lawfully requested that Citibank disburse from Climate United’s accounts, pursuant to the \nACA. \n181.

Climate United has a legal right to possess and control the grant funds held in its \naccounts at Citibank, pursuant to the ACA. \n185.  Citibank has wrongfully and intentionally exercised dominion or control over the \ngrant funds in Climate United’s accounts, including by failing to disburse grant funds to Climate \nUnited from Climate United’s accounts in response to Climate United’s valid and proper requests. \n186.  Citibank has intentionally permanently or substantially interfered with Climate \nUnited’s property rights, including by failing to disburse grant funds to Climate United from \nClimate United’s accounts in response to Climate United’s valid and proper requests. \n187.  Citibank has acted without Climate United’s consent and has no legal basis or valid \njustification for its actions. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 24     Filed 03/17/25     Page 60 of 62\n \n188.

This case seeks to vindicate the right of Plaintiff Climate United Fund (“Climate \nUnited”) to access grant funds to which it is legally entitled. \n2.  On October 12, 2023, Climate United applied for grant funding from EPA through \nthe National Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”), a program under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 2 of 35\n \nFund (“GGRF”). The grant is intended to support Climate United’s efforts to offer financing for \ncritical  clean  energy  projects  that  accelerate  local  economic  development,  save  money  for \nAmerican families and small businesses, spur demand for domestic manufacturing, create jobs, \nand reduce air pollution. After being announced as a grantee in April 2024, Climate United has \nfunded projects across the United States that support domestic clean energy development, build \nhealthy and affordable housing, accelerate American-made electric vehicle manufacturing, and \nsave hard-working Americans money on their bills. \n3.  The grant requires Climate United’s grant funds to be held at Citibank, N.A. \n(“Citibank”),  under  a  Financial  Agent  Agreement  (“FAA”)  between  Citibank  and  the  U.S. \nTreasury Department, and an Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between Citibank, Climate \nUnited, and EPA that sets forth the specific details for EPA to exercise “control” as a secured \nparty. EPA contemplated this arrangement from the program’s inception—and described it in the \noriginal Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) in July 2023 as critical both to allow recipients \nto leverage private capital and to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” EPA designed, \nstructured, and negotiated the FAA and the ACA to provide transparency and accountability. The \nACA includes provisions that allow EPA to take exclusive control of the funds at Citibank under \ncertain specified conditions. Unless EPA takes exclusive control of the funds, Citibank must \ndisburse funds to Climate United at Climate United’s request. \n4.  EPA has never attempted to exercise its right to take exclusive control of the funds \nthrough legal means—nor could it, because the preconditions for exercising that right have not \noccurred.  \n5.  Nonetheless, EPA’s Administrator has made several public statements expressing \nhostility to the GGRF program. For instance, he stated on national television, without basis, that \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 3 of 35\n \n“the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.” He has also publicly stated that EPA is “not going \nto rest” until it has “recovered” those funds. On March 4, 2025, he publicly stated that the “money \nis now FROZEN.” EPA has also undertaken behind-the-scenes efforts to cause Citibank to \nwithhold Climate United’s funds. These efforts resulted in the public resignation of the Chief of \nthe Criminal Division of the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office, after more than 24 years in that office, \nfollowing her refusal to carry out an illegal directive to send a letter to Citibank demanding that it \nfreeze GGRF funds. \n6.  These efforts have apparently worked, as Citibank is now refusing to honor Climate \nUnited’s disbursement requests, despite Citibank’s unambiguous contractual obligation to do so. \nOn February 18, 2025, Climate United requested a disbursement of funds in the normal course, as \nit had done multiple times before. But Citibank did not follow Climate United’s instructions, and \nClimate United has since been unable to access the grant funds to which it is entitled.  \n7.  Citibank has never articulated any legal justification for its refusal to honor the \nACA. None exists. Instead, Citibank says it is waiting for direction from EPA before disbursing \nany grant funds. But the ACA does not allow Citibank to withhold Climate United’s grant funds \nunless EPA has given notice that it intends to exercise exclusive control over the accounts. EPA \nhas not done so and cannot possibly do so because there is no legal justification for such an action.  \n8.  EPA has no legal basis for causing Citibank to deny Climate United’s disbursement \nrequests.  Under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”),  EPA’s  de  facto  suspension  or \ntermination of Climate United’s grant is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law. \nIndeed, EPA has offered no reasoned explanation for its action, which violates multiple statutes \nand regulations. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 4 of 35\n \n9.  To the extent EPA pins the blame on Citibank, Citibank likewise has no legal basis \nfor its actions. By failing to disburse Climate United’s grant funds, Citibank is in breach of the \nACA and has wrongfully withheld the grant funds that Climate United has an immediate legal \nright to possess. \n10.  Defendants’  unlawful  actions  are  causing  Climate  United  to  suffer  real  and \nimmediate harm. Climate United does not have other committed sources of funding to replace the \ngrant funds. Without those grant funds, Climate United will shortly run out of cash to pay operating \nexpenses—it will no longer be able to pay its employees, pay rent, pay critical service providers \nand contractors, or meet its commitments under the loans and awards it has already approved. In \nfact, as a result of Defendants’ actions, Climate United has already been compelled to defer \ncompensation for certain staff to preserve its available cash, while also confronting increasingly \nunfavorable  terms  from  essential  vendors  and  prospective  deal  partners.  Failure  to  honor \ncommitments will erode trust in Climate United as an institution, damage its reputation, and cause \nprofound harm to the local organizations that rely on Climate United funds to develop critical \nenergy projects that reduce energy costs and create jobs.  \n11.  Climate United’s access to its grant funding should be restored. The Court should \ndirect Citibank to adhere to its contractual obligations, and bar EPA from interfering with \nCitibank’s disbursements.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n12.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief and replevin based on \nCitibank’s  breach  of  contract  and  conversion  and  EPA’s  violation  of  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act and the Due Process Clause.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 5 of 35\n \n13.  The Court has jurisdiction over Climate United’s claims against Defendants EPA \nand Zeldin under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n14.  The Court has jurisdiction over Climate United’s claims against Citibank under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1367, because those claims are so related to Climate United’s claims against EPA that \nthey are part of the same case or controversy.1  \n15.  Venue is proper in this district because EPA is located in this district and a \nsubstantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n16.  Climate United, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in \nMaryland, is a nonprofit financial institution whose mission is to leverage public and private \nfinancing to remove financial barriers to deploying clean energy. Climate United’s work aims to \nunleash American clean energy and build a stronger, more efficient, and more resilient economy \nthat lowers energy costs, creates jobs, improves public health, and benefits every American, while \nmaking the United States more competitive, secure, and energy independent.  \n17.  The Climate United coalition brings together three established nonprofits—Calvert \nImpact, Community Preservation Corporation, and Center for Community Self-Help (“Self-\nHelp”)—that have a combined 120 years of experience managing more than $30 billion in private \nand institutional capital that has unlocked economic opportunity for communities in all 50 states \nand territories.  \n \n1 Even if EPA was not named as a defendant, the Court would have jurisdiction over Climate \nUnited’s claims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the parties are of diverse \ncitizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 6 of 35\n \n18.  Climate United helps fill market gaps where private capital is missing, bringing the \neconomic benefits of clean energy, electric mobility, and building efficiency projects to overlooked \nmarkets. From Arkansas to Alaska, these projects will deliver direct benefits to hard-working \nAmericans and communities in the form of lower energy bills, quality jobs, cleaner air and water, \nand more secure and reliable energy. Climate United focuses its loans and investments in rural, \nlow-income, and Tribal communities across the country, building demand for clean energy and \nproviding  markets  for  domestic  manufacturing.  Climate  United’s  investments  also  mobilize \nprivate capital, stretching public dollars to go further: for every dollar invested in a program or \nproject, Climate United estimates up to four dollars of private capital flow into communities.  \n19.  Defendant Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) is a national banking association organized \nand existing under the laws of the United States of America, with headquarters in South Dakota. \nCitibank is the wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc., headquartered in New York. \n20.  Defendant EPA is the agency of the federal government of the United States \nresponsible for administering the GGRF and its constituent NCIF program. EPA is an agency \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  \n21.  Defendant Lee Zeldin is the EPA Administrator and the agency’s highest ranking \nofficial. Climate United sues Administrator Zeldin in his official capacity.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Congress Establishes the NCIF Program. \n \n22.  In  2022,  Congress  passed  and  President  Biden  signed  into  law  the  Inflation \nReduction Act. Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818. The Act amended the Clean Air Act to \nauthorize the GGRF, which appropriated $27 billion to invest in clean energy in communities \nacross the county. See 42 U.S.C. § 7434; About the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, EPA, \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 7 of 35\n \nhttps://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/about-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund  (last \nupdated Feb. 13, 2025).  \n23.  The statute created this new program to leverage public funds with private capital \nand catalyze investment into places and projects that support local economic development, much \nlike other government programs such as Small Business Administration loan guarantees, New \nMarket Tax Credits, and Opportunity Zones. \n24.  The GGRF essentially establishes “[g]reen banks,” which are “financial institutions \naimed at overcoming market barriers and scaling up investment in low-carbon technologies and \nclimate-resilient infrastructure.” Cong. Rsch. Serv. IN12090, EPA’s Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund (updated Feb. 14, 2023), https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12090. Green \nbanks are generally used “to deliver projects that are not sufficiently met by other financial \nmarkets.” Green Banks, EPA, https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/green-banks (last updated \nJan. 24, 2025).  \n25.  Specifically, Section 134(a)(2) of the Inflation Reduction Act appropriated to the \nEPA Administrator $11.97 billion “to make grants, on a competitive basis …, to eligible recipients \nfor the purposes of providing financial assistance and technical assistance in accordance with \nsubsection (b).” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2).  \n26.  Section 134(a)(3) of the Act appropriated to the EPA Administrator $8 billion to \n“make grants, on a competitive basis …, to eligible recipients for the purposes of providing \nfinancial assistance and technical assistance in low-income and disadvantaged communities in \naccordance with subsection (b).” Id. § 7434(a)(3). \n27.  In turn, subsection (b) provides that an eligible recipient shall use the grant in \naccordance with the following: (1) facilitating “financial assistance to qualified projects at the \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 8 of 35\n \nnational, regional, State, and local levels”; (2) prioritizing “investment in qualified projects that \nwould  otherwise  lack  access  to  financing”;  (3)  “retain[ing],  manag[ing],  recycl[ing],  and \nmonetiz[ing] all repayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid loans, and all \nother  types  of  financial  assistance  provided  using  grant  funds  under  this  section  to  ensure \ncontinued operability”; and (4) providing “funding and technical assistance to establish new or \nsupport existing public, quasi-public, not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial \nassistance to qualified projects.” Id. § 7434(b).  \n28.  Eligible recipients are defined to include nonprofit organizations that are “designed \nto provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the \nrapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services,” that do not \n“take deposits other than deposits from repayments and other revenue received from financial \nassistance provided using grant funds under this section,” that are “funded by public or charitable \ncontributions,” and that “invest[ ] in or finance[ ] projects alone or in conjunction with other \ninvestors.” Id. § 7434(c)(1).  \n29.  Qualified projects are defined to include any “project, activity, or technology” that \neither “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership \nwith, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector,” or “assists communities in the efforts \nof those communities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air \npollution.” Id. § 7434(c)(3).  \n30.  In 2023, EPA launched three grant competitions, including the approximately $14 \nbillion National Clean Investment Fund competition geared at “financ[ing] clean technology \ndeployment nationally.” NOFO at 3. The NCIF program was “funded with $11.97 billion from \nSection 134(a)(2) and $2.00 billion from Section 134(a)(3).” Frequent Questions About the Fund, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 9 of 35\n \nEPA,  https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/frequent-questions-about-fund  (last \nupdated Oct. 17, 2024).  \n31.  The purpose of the NCIF competition was to “provide grants to 2-3 national \nnonprofit financing entities to create national clean financing institutions capable of partnering \nwith the private sector to provide accessible, affordable financing for tens of thousands of clean \ntechnology projects nationwide.” NOFO at 4. \n32.  Sections 134(a)(1) and 134(a)(2) provided that the EPA Administrator could award \ngrants “on a competitive basis” until September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), (2).  \nB.  Climate United Is Awarded NCIF Grant Funding. \n \n33.  Following passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, Calvert Impact, Community \nPreservation Corporation, and Self-Help joined together to form a coalition to apply for the GGRF \ncompetition. The three coalition members have been in operation for 30 years, 50 years, and 40 \nyears respectively. Together, they have more than 120 years’ experience managing more than $30 \nbillion in private and institutional capital. While each of the coalition partners would have been \neligible recipients, each formed bespoke subsidiaries to act as the grant recipients and subrecipients \nto allow them to adopt custom policies, procedures, and governance specifically crafted to more \nefficiently deploy grant funds while mitigating deployment risk. The subsidiaries benefit from the \norganizational infrastructure and experience of their parent organizations while allowing them to \nleverage grant funds with private capital more effectively as stand-alone entities.  \n34.  In July 2023, EPA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for the NCIF. The \nNOFO “included a robust set of application requirements and corresponding evaluation criteria \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 10 of 35\n \nthat were used to assess materials submitted to meet those application requirements.2 “Application \nrequirements covered a diverse set of topics and included not just a detailed project narrative but \nalso a robust set of application attachments,” such as “organizational and governing documents; \nresumes of board members and senior management; legal and compliance risk management \npolicies  and  procedures;  financial  statements;  workplans  for  the  first  year  of  program \nimplementations, and budget narratives.”3 \n35.  EPA established a rigorous process to review and select applications. That process \nincluded  an  evaluation  of  each  applicant’s  program  plan,  organizational  capacity,  previous \nexperience managing third-party capital, and experience managing financial, credit, compliance, \nand other risks. The review was conducted by expert panels with broad and deep qualifications \nwho would then present rankings and recommendations to a Selection Official authorized to make \nthe final selection for awards. NOFO at 54.  \n36.  Climate United entered the NCIF grant competition with a $13.97 billion proposal \nto accelerate clean energy adoption across the U.S. economy, including by offering affordable \nfinancing for clean technology programs. As part of the application process, Climate United was \nrequired to submit a detailed budget to EPA. Additionally, prior to receiving the Notice of Award, \nClimate United was required to attach a negotiated, thoroughly reviewed, and approved budget to \nits grant agreement.  \n \n2 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Review and Selection Process, EPA (last updated Aug. 16, \n2024), https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/review-and-selection-process.  \n3 Id. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 11 of 35\n \n37.  Following the agency’s lengthy and rigorous review process, Climate United was \nawarded $6.97 billion. The award was publicly announced by the White House in April 2024, in a \npress release touting Climate United’s credentials and vision.4  \n38.  Consistent with the purpose of the Inflation Reduction Act under which the NCIF \nfunds were appropriated, Climate United developed and EPA approved a workplan that was \nfinalized with the award and posted publicly for full transparency. As enumerated in the workplan, \nthe Climate United coalition plans to commit at least $580 million toward qualified projects in the \nfirst year of funding (i.e., before July 2025), and to draw the full $6.97 billion over the first five \nyears of the program. To date, the Climate United coalition has committed $392 million to \nqualified projects. Approximately 45% of Climate United investments (the portion of the funds \nprovided through financial assistance), or approximately $2.8 billion of the Initial Award, will \nfocus on investing in energy-efficient buildings and homes. Approximately 20% of Climate United \ninvestments, or approximately $1.2 billion of the NCIF Award, will focus on electric transportation \nand charging infrastructure. Another approximately 25% of Climate United investments, or \napproximately  $1.5  billion  of  the  NCIF  Award,  will  focus  on  producing  affordable,  clean \nelectricity and heat through renewable energy generation and battery storage, including through \nsolar, hydroelectric, and geothermal power. The remaining 10% of investments will focus on other \nsectors that cut costs, reduce pollution, and provide direct benefits to American families, including \nin agriculture. Further, consistent with the terms of the grant award, Climate United will deploy \n \n4 Biden-Harris Administration Announces $20 Billion in Grants to Mobilize Private Capital and \nDeliver Clean Energy and Climate Solutions to Communities Across America, EPA (last updated \nAug.  16,  2024),  https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-\nbillion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 12 of 35\n \n60% of its investments in low- and moderate- income communities, 20% of its investments in rural \ncommunities and 10% of its investments in Tribal communities. \nC.  The Terms and Conditions of the Grant, Including Suspending or \nTerminating the Grant.  \n \n39.  The award was memorialized in a final grant agreement, known formally as a \nNotice of Award (“NOA”), dated August 8, 2024 [hereinafter “August NOA”]. The August NOA \nappended Terms and Conditions governing the grant. The Terms and Conditions in the August \nNOA included several requirements regarding the use of GGRF funding, including labor and \nworkforce requirements, id. at 34, “Buy America” requirements, id. at 28, consumer protection \nrequirements, id. at 36, and training requirements, id. at 33-34.  \n40.  The Terms and Conditions in the August NOA required Climate United to adhere \nto a rigorous set of reporting requirements. These include requirements to produce quarterly, semi-\nannual, annual, and final reports to EPA with “detailed narratives describing program performance \n… supported with qualitative discussions and quantitative metrics,” id. at 16, submit quarterly \ntransaction-level and project-level data reports, id. at 17-18, and provide ongoing disclosures to \nEPA, id. at 18-19.  \n41.  The Terms and Conditions in the August NOA provided that Climate United “must \nobtain prior written approval from the EPA Project Officer (who will in turn notify the EPA Award \nOfficial) for any transfers that will not be disbursed for an Allowable Activity within 15 business \ndays.” Id. at 61. \n42.  In addition, the Terms and Conditions required Climate United (as well as other \nGGRF recipients) to complete standard EPA grants training within 90 days of receipt of the grant, \nincluding the “EPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and Recipients” and “How to \nDevelop a Budget.” Id. at 8. Climate United complied with this requirement, even though Climate \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 13 of 35\n \nUnited had already submitted a detailed budget to EPA in connection with the grant competition \nselection process, and had already attached a negotiated, reviewed, and approved budget to its \ngrant agreement before receiving the Notice of Award. \n43.  The August NOA was amended on December 20, 2024 [hereinafter “December \nNOA”]. The December NOA was substantially similar to the August NOA. The changes primarily \nreflected the insights gained from six months of feedback from going to market with the program, \nin particular clarifying the applicability of “Build America, Buy America” requirements and the \napplicability of Davis Bacon and Related Acts to projects. The December NOA did not alter the \noverall grant award or the underlying reporting and transparency requirements. However, the \nDecember NOA updated certain Terms and Conditions governing the grant. December NOA at 1. \nAs relevant here, the December NOA updated the terms and conditions to account for Citigroup \nbeing selected by the Treasury Department to serve as its financial agent; clarified the definitions \nof  “Waste,  Fraud,  and  Abuse”  and  “Materially  Impaired”;  clarified  which  versions  of  the \napplicable regulations govern termination of the grant; and specified certain procedures involved \nin issuing notices about the grant funds to financial institutions. December NOA at 12, 41, 56.   \n44.  Among other things, the Terms and Conditions in the December NOA described \nthe three specific requirements with which EPA must comply to suspend or terminate Climate \nUnited’s award. December NOA at 41. The Terms and Conditions do not allow for EPA to \nunilaterally suspend the grant or remove Climate United’s ability to access funding. \na.  First, EPA may terminate the Agreement if Climate United engages in “substantial” \nnoncompliance such that “effective performance” is “Materially Impaired.” Id. \nEffective  performance  is  “Materially  Impaired”  if  (1)  EPA  issues  a  “written \ndetermination and finding … that the Recipient has failed to achieve sufficient \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 14 of 35\n \nprogress  in  accordance  with  the  Sufficient  Progress  clause”  and,  (2)  if  EPA \ndetermines in its sole discretion that a “corrective action plan” would remedy the \nissue, EPA must issue a “separate written determination and finding” that the \nRecipient “has not materially addressed its failure.” Id. at 8–9.  \nb.  Second, EPA may terminate the Agreement if Climate United engages in “material \nmisrepresentation of eligibility status.” Id. at 41.  \nc.  Third, EPA may terminate the Agreement for “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” id., which \nis defined with reference to the EPA General Terms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § \n200.113, id. at 12. Those sources require “credible evidence of the commission of \na violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or \ngratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the \ncivil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).” See EPA, General Terms and \nConditions  (effective  Oct.  1,  2024), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-10/fy_2025_\nepa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.pdf;  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.113. \n45.  In addition, EPA is obligated by regulation to take certain procedural steps to \nterminate the grant agreement. Among other things, EPA must comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, \nwhich requires EPA to provide written notice of termination to the recipient that includes “the \nreasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, \nif  applicable.”  2  C.F.R.  § 200.341;  December  NOA  at  41  (incorporating  this  regulatory \nrequirement into the Terms and Conditions).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 15 of 35\n \n46.  The  December  NOA  was  further  amended  on  January  16,  2025  [hereinafter \n“January NOA”] to tweak the allocation of grant funds within specified budget categories, to align \nwith updates to the Code of Federal Regulations, and to update the workplan. Compare December \nNOA at 3 and January NOA at 3. The January NOA did not change the operative Terms and \nConditions attached to the December NOA (including any terms related to termination) nor alter \nthe overall grant award. January NOA at 1, 4–5. The Terms and Conditions in the December NOA \nare thus the operative Terms and Conditions that remain binding on Climate United and EPA.  \nD.  The Account Control Agreement Between Climate United, EPA, and \nCitibank. \n \n47.  The grant agreement required Climate United to enter into an Account Control \nAgreement. Under the ACA, Citibank administers the funds provided under the NCIF. To do so, \nCitibank is “designated and authorized to act as a financial agent of the United States” pursuant to \nthe authority of the Treasury Department, and EPA is serving as the “Secured Party.” ACA at 1. \nAfter a thorough selection process run by the Treasury Department, Climate United entered into \nthe ACA with EPA and Citibank on November 1, 2024. Climate United, EPA, and Citibank \nexecuted an amendment on January 13, 2025, to clarify the parties’ intent regarding the treatment \nof certain obligations that were “properly incurred,” if EPA issued a Notice of Exclusive Control \n[hereinafter “Amended ACA”].  \n48.  The  Financial  Agent  concept  is  an  established  mechanism  for  disbursing \ngovernment funding that was first authorized in the 1860s and has been used for decades.5 As \nrelevant here, the use of a financial agent was referenced in the EPA’s Notice of Funding \n \n5 Revenue Collections And Payments: Treasury Has Used Financial Agents in Evolving Ways but \nCould  Improve  Transparency,  GAO-17-176  (Jan.  2017),  https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-\n176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions of \ndisbursing payments and collecting revenue.”). \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 16 of 35\n \nOpportunity released in July 2023, and the ACA was described in the Terms and Conditions of the \nAugust NOA. August NOA at 58; NOFO at 56. Climate United had no role in EPA’s decision to \ninclude the financial agent concept in the Notice of Funding Opportunity in July 2023. Climate \nUnited also had no role in the selection of the financial agent, which was coordinated by EPA and \nthe Treasury Department as part of a competitive process.  \n49.  The financial agent arrangement provides EPA with full transparency into how \ngrant funds are being spent. EPA has full, real time view access into all accounts of Climate United \nand its subrecipients. The alternative mechanism used to disburse funds under EPA grants is the \nAutomated Standard Application for Payments (“ASAP”) system, which Climate United used to \naccess funds between August 2024 (when the initial NOA was finalized) and November 2024, \nwhile the ACA was being finalized. But ASAP is far less transparent by comparison. ASAP \nprovides only a running total of grant funds disbursed to a grant recipient—it does not allow for \nvisibility into the activities of subrecipients. Therefore, the financial agent arrangement increases \nEPA’s  oversight  of  funds  by  requiring  Climate  United  and  its  subrecipients  to  disclose \nexpenditures by budget category in real time. The financial agent arrangement also provides EPA \nwith full visibility into any program income generated by Climate United or any subrecipient, \nwhich is typically opaque to EPA under the ASAP system.  \n50.  The ACA specifies that Citibank’s duties with respect to the funding are exclusively \n“administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature).” ACA at 3. The \nACA further specifies that Citibank “shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred to \nor described herein (including, without limitation, the Grant Agreement …), or for determining or \ncompelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby.” Id.  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 17 of 35\n \n51.  Citibank is required to disburse funds to Climate United upon Climate United’s \nrequest. ACA § 2 provides that Citibank “shall comply with all instructions, notifications, and \nentitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts including, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or \nredemption of interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts.” \n52.  Citibank is not required to disburse funds to Climate United if EPA exercises its \n“right of control” under the ACA. ACA § 2; see also Amended ACA § 1 (amending ACA § 2 to \nclarify that “after the delivery of a Notice of Exclusive Control, Bank shall continue to disburse \nfunds and financial assets associated with financial obligations ‘properly incurred’ by the Pledgor \nprior to the issuance of, but not in anticipation of, a delivery of a Notice of Exclusive Control … \nexcept for any specific funds or financial assets, identified by Secured Party in the applicable \nNotice of Exclusive Control as not being ‘properly incurred’ by the Pledgor in accordance with 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.343.”). \n53.  To exercise its right of control, EPA must notify Citibank of its intention to exercise \nexclusive control over the accounts, in a form substantially similar to a sample Notice of Exclusive \nControl contained in the ACA. Id.; Amended ACA at 10 (Exhibit A: Sample NOEC); see also \nACA at 3 (stating that Climate United and EPA “have agreed that the terms and conditions entitled \n‘Deposit Account at Financial Agent’ in the Grant Agreement indicate the conditions under which \nthe [EPA] may exercise its right of control”). \n54.  The operative form Notice of Exclusive Control states: “As required by the Grant \nAgreement, the Secured Party [i.e., EPA] has issued a written determination and finding that \nPledgor [i.e., Climate United] has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement, and that noncompliance is substantial such that effective performance of the Grant \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 18 of 35\n \nAgreement is Materially Impaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse (as \ndefined in the Grant Agreement) or material misrepresentation of eligibility status, and that the \nSecured Party has initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or partly suspend or terminate \nthe Grant Agreement, as authorized in the terms of the Grant Agreement.” Amended ACA at 10.  \n55.  The form NOEC thus incorporates the standard for termination of the award \nspecified under the Terms and Conditions. Compare id., with December NOA at 41 (discussing \ntermination  under  “programmatic  conditions”)  and  January  NOA  at  5  (“All  Programmatic \nConditions Remain the Same”). \nE.  Climate United Uses Grant Funds Provided By Citibank In The Normal \nCourse. \n \n56.  Climate United’s funds were fully obligated by EPA on August 8, 2024. While the \nNOA contemplated the financial agent arrangement, Climate United initially accessed funds \nthrough the Treasury’s ASAP system as Treasury worked to set up the financial agent arrangement. \nThe remainder of Climate United’s undrawn funding was disbursed to accounts held at Citibank, \nafter those accounts were established, and subject to the ACA.  \n57.  Thereafter, Climate United drew money from its Citibank accounts approximately \nonce every two weeks to pay operating expenses, as permitted by the governing Terms and \nConditions, which requires prior approval for drawing of transfers that will not be disbursed in the \nfollowing fourteen business days. See December NOA at 57–58.  \n58.  Climate United has used grant funds for salaries and benefits for 37 employees on \nits payroll. These staff members collectively operate all aspects of Climate United’s operations, \nincluding establishing financing programs, underwriting potential financial transactions, ensuring \ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the NCIF Award, soliciting and selecting partners, \nconducting community engagement, and structuring and servicing a portfolio of loans.  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 19 of 35\n \n59.  Climate United has used grant funds to launch three financing programs to date. \nThe first is a $31.8 million pre-construction loan to support solar power projects across rural \ncommunities in Arkansas, which was announced in October 2024. Through this project, Climate \nUnited is financing pre-construction costs for 18 solar projects comprising the largest commercial \nand industrial solar deployment in Arkansas history, which is projected to save more than $120 \nmillion in energy costs over the project’s life and create hundreds of jobs.  \n60.  The second is a program to offer affordable leasing options for battery electric \nheavy-duty trucks to small fleets and independent operators. Climate United issued a request for \nproposals in October 2024 from qualified U.S. auto manufacturers to deliver up to 500 electric \ndrayage trucks, which Climate United intends to begin leasing at the ports of Long Beach and Los \nAngeles. When completed, these orders will represent some of the largest-ever purchases of \ndomestically manufactured battery electric trucks in U.S. history. Climate United intends to \nexpand this program nationally. This program will not only reduce the cost per mile of operating \ndrayage trucks for small businesses, but it will also reduce air pollution in port communities and \ncreate demand for U.S. manufacturing in factories across the country.  \n61.  The third is $63 million in committed pre-construction financing for projects to \ndesign and develop solar power plants in partnership with Tribal governments and communities. \nThese projects bring access to affordable energy to rural communities and Indigenous people in \naddition to quality jobs and local economic development. Initial projects will be located in Eastern \nOregon and Idaho.  \n62.  In addition, Climate United has used grant funds to design, develop and launch the \nClimate United NEXT program. This is a pre-development grant program intended to provide up \nto $30 million in technical assistance and planning support for community-led projects that \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 20 of 35\n \nincrease energy independence and resiliency, reduce pollution, and save money for families, small \nbusinesses,  and  communities.  The  first  round  of  grants  focused  on  projects  serving  Tribal \ncommunities. Climate United publicly committed to announcing pre-development grants through \nthe NEXT program across the United States by the end of February 2025. After reviewing 104 \napplications for the program in the first round of submissions, Climate United approved 22 awards \nacross 18 states, and anticipates issuing $6.35 million in initial subawards.  \nF.  EPA Takes Actions to Suspend or Terminate Climate United’s Grant, And to \nCause Citibank to Not Disburse Climate United’s Funds. \n \n63.  On January 30, 2025, Administrator Zeldin was sworn in as the EPA Administrator.  \n64.  On February 12, 2025, Administrator Zeldin made a public statement announcing \nEPA’s goal of taking possession of grant funds disbursed pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act, \nreferring to Climate United by name.6 Without mentioning any specific basis for adverse action \nunder the terms of Climate United’s award—or that of any other recipient—Administrator Zeldin \nstated that “the financial agent agreement with the Bank needs to be instantly terminated,” and \nstated that “the Bank must immediately return” the grant funds.7 To ensure EPA “reassume[s] \nresponsibility for all of these funds,” Administrator Zeldin then stated that he would “refer[] this \nmatter to the Inspector General’s Office and will work with the Justice Department,” and that EPA \nis “not going to rest” until it has “recover[ed]” the grant funds.8 \n \n6  Lee  Zeldin  (@EPALeeZeldin),  X,  at  1:40  (Feb.  12,  2025,  7:52  PM), \nhttps://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778. \n7 Id. at 2:15. \n8  Rapid  Response  47  (@RapidResponse47),  X  (Feb.  25,  2025,  10:16  AM), \nhttps://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894406216052289869. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 21 of 35\n \n65.  According to public news reporting, EPA thereafter took multiple actions designed \nto suspend or terminate Climate United’s grant, and cause Citibank to withhold grant funds from \nClimate United. Those actions include, but are not limited to: \na.  The Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”) at the Department of Justice \ncommunicated with the United States Attorney’s Office in Washington, D.C. \n(“USAO-DC”), seeking to open a grand jury investigation into Climate United’s \ncontract awarded by EPA.9 Denise Cheung, the Chief of the Criminal Division at \nUSAO-DC, advised that there was not an adequate factual basis to open that grand \njury investigation.10 At some point thereafter, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s \nWashington  Field  Office  issued  a  “Freeze  Letter”  to  Citibank  containing  a \nrecommendation that Citibank freeze Climate United’s assets.11  \nb.  The ODAG instructed that a second letter be sent to Citibank directing that Citibank \nimplement an asset freeze and refrain from releasing funds pursuant to a criminal \ninvestigation.12 In response, senior officials at the DC-USAO again asserted there \nwas not sufficient evidence to justify issuing that letter.13 Consistent with her oath \n \n9 Read the Resignation Letter by Denise Cheung, a Veteran D.C.

On February 19, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated on X that he had “just read” a \n“grant agreement” related to the GGRF, characterizing it as “wild.”17  \ne.  On February 22, 2025, and at other times thereafter, Administrator Zeldin has stated \nthat he has cancelled several grant agreements, apparently unilaterally, regarding \nclimate and the environment.18  \n \n14 Id. \n15 Spencer Hsu, Maxine Joselow & Nicolas Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe Amid Pushback \nfrom Judge, Prosecutors, Wash.

On March 2, 2025, EPA Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh sent a letter to \nEPA’s Office of the Inspector General asking for an OIG investigation into GGRF \nfunding.20  \nh.  On March 4, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated: “The money is now FROZEN and \nDOJ/FBI is investigating.”21 Notwithstanding the Administrator’s statements, EPA \non other occasions has stated that Citibank is acting voluntarily.22 \n66.  EPA has not issued the Notice of Exclusive Control—which is the legal tool \ndescribed in the ACA for restricting Climate United’s access to these funds.  \n67.  Citibank has failed to comply with Climate United’s normal-course requests for \ndisbursements, as required by the ACA, and has failed to provide Climate United with any legal \nbasis for its failure to act other than vague references to awaiting EPA’s guidance.  \na.

On February 19, 2025, at 9:43 am EST, Climate United submitted an email message \nto Citibank noting that its funding requests remain pending and have not been \ndisbursed. That letter requested that Citibank provide the legal bases for those \nactions, advise whether those actions were taken pursuant to a directive by a \ngovernment  agency,  and  provide  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  respond  to  any \ninstruction or request that impacts Climate United’s accounts before that instruction \nor request may be acted upon by Citibank.

On March 1, 2025, counsel submitted a letter in hard copy and by email to the Chief \nExecutive and Chief Legal Officers of Citibank. The letter explained that Citibank \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 25 of 35\n \nis illegally withholding Climate United’s funds in breach of the ACA; has ignored \nClimate United’s repeated requests for information by phone, voicemail, and email; \nand has failed to provide any colorable legal basis for Citibank’s actions. The letter \ndemanded a response by no later than close of business on Tuesday, March 4, 2025. \nCitibank failed to respond.  \ng.  On  March  3,  2025,  Climate  United  contacted  Citibank  by  email  requesting \ninformation  about  the  status  of  Climate  United’s  funds  and  the  process  for \ndisbursing those funds. For the first time, Citibank responded, stating: “We have \nreceived  your  correspondence  and  have  forwarded  it  to  the  United  States \nEnvironmental Protection Agency and other federal officials for an appropriate \nresponse. … Once we have further information available regarding the program we \ncan provide at that time.” In response to a follow-up email from Climate United \nrequesting clarification, Citibank stated: “We are awaiting further guidance.”  \nh.  On March 4, 2025, Climate United submitted a letter to EPA by email, notifying \nEPA that Climate United has been unable to access its funding and to request \ninformation regarding the nature of and legal justification for EPA’s actions. The \nletter requested that EPA immediately reverse its actions and reinstate Climate \nUnited’s access to its NCIF funding. In the alternative, the letter requested that EPA \nrescind or stay any suspension of termination of Climate United’s grant pending \njudicial review. EPA did not respond. \ni.  On March 4, 2025, in “a statement emailed to Newsweek…, a spokesperson for \nCitibank said Citi has been working with federal officials to ‘address government \nofficials’ concerns’ regarding the GGRF. ‘Our role as financial agent does not \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 26 of 35\n \ninvolve any discretion over which organizations receive grant funds,’ the bank said \nin its statement. ‘Citi will of course comply with any binding instructions from the \nfederal government.’”23  \n68.  EPA has failed to provide Climate United with a reasoned explanation for its \nactions or a meaningful opportunity to object or to be heard. \na.  On February 20, 2025, Climate United sent an email message to officials at EPA \nnotifying EPA that it was being denied access to its funds and to request additional \ninformation and guidance by 10 am on February 21, 2025. The EPA team replied \non February 21, providing no additional information but offering to discuss the \nfollowing week. The following week, however, EPA rescheduled the meeting three \ntimes. After being informed that Climate United’s outside counsel would be present \nat the meeting, an EPA official cancelled the meeting without rescheduling.  \nb.  Climate United subsequently called the EPA official on February 27. The official’s \nadministrative assistant responded that the official was in possession of Climate \nUnited’s e-mails and would reach out. As of the date of this filing, Climate United \nis still awaiting a response.  \nc.  As of the date of this filing, Climate United is also still waiting for a response from \nEPA to Climate United’s letter to EPA dated March 4, 2025, which is described \nabove. \n \n23 Jeff Young, Green Group Wants EPA to Explain Why $20 Billion Accounts Are Frozen, \nNewsweek  (Mar.  4,  2025),  https://www.newsweek.com/climate-united-fund-epa-letter-frozen-\nbank-accounts-2039608. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 27 of 35\n \nG.  Citibank and EPA’s Actions Have Harmed Climate United. \n \n69.  The NCIF award is currently the basis of funding for all of Climate United’s \noperations and for all financing projects that Climate United either has launched or is planning to \nlaunch. Even temporary inability to access its funding immediately threatens Climate United’s \noperations, its ongoing and future projects, and its long-term reputation. \n70.  Climate United does not have other committed sources of funding to replace the \nNCIF  award.  Nor  is  private  investment  a  viable  replacement.  In  fact,  Climate  United  was \nspecifically awarded NCIF funding to “prioritize investment in qualified projects that would \notherwise lack access to financing.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(b)(1)(B). \n71.  Climate  United  has  already  been  forced  to  defer  compensation  for  certain \nemployees to preserve cash. Without another source of funding, Climate United will shortly run \nout of funds to pay operating expenses. At that point, it will no longer be able to pay its employees \nand will face the risk of cutting hours and/or furloughing staff, beyond the compensation it has \nalready deferred. Climate United also imminently risks not being able to pay rent for select offices \nor to pay critical third-party contractors who perform necessary services such as auditing financial \nstatements, maintaining IT security and infrastructure, and providing legal services. In addition, as \nClimate United has explained to EPA, continuing uncertainty around Climate United’s funding \nhas caused Climate United to confront increasingly unfavorable terms from essential third-party \ncontractors as well as prospective deal partners.    \n72.  Further, without a source of funding, Climate United would not be able to meet its \ncommitments under the loans and awards it has already approved. This could render Climate \nUnited in breach of its existing agreements, would erode trust in Climate United as an institution \nand damage its reputation, and would cause profound harm to the local organizations who rely on \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 28 of 35\n \nthese funds to develop critical energy projects that reduce costs and create jobs. As examples, \nClimate United will be unable to support the worthwhile projects described above—including the \nsolar projects in Arkansas, the project to develop and lease electric heavy-duty drayage trucks in \nthe ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles, the projects to design and develop solar power plants \nin partnership with Tribal governments and communities in Eastern Oregon and Idaho, and the 22 \nTribal projects across 18 states as part of the NEXT program.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT ONE: BREACH OF CONTRACT \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n73.  Climate  United  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n74.  Citibank has a duty under the ACA to disburse Climate United’s grant funds to \nClimate United, as Climate United requests. Under the ACA, Citibank “shall comply with all \ninstructions, notifications, and entitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of \nfunds and financial assets in the Accounts.” ACA at 2. \n75.  Prior to February 18, 2025, when Climate United requested that Citibank disburse \ngrant funds held in Climate United’s accounts, Citibank complied with those requests as required \nby the ACA.  \n76.  On February 18, 2025 and February 21, 2025, when Climate United requested that \nCitibank disburse grant funds held in Climate United’s accounts, as required by the ACA, Citibank \nfailed to disburse such funds. \n77.  Thereafter, on subsequent occasions when Climate United requested that Citibank \ndisburse grant funds held in Climate United’s account, as required by the ACA, Citibank has failed \nto disburse such funds. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 29 of 35\n \n78.  Citibank has not offered any legal or factual basis for failing to disburse grant funds \nfrom Climate United’s accounts, as required by the ACA. \n79.  Under the ACA, Citibank’s duties with respect to Climate United’s grant funding \nare exclusively “administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature),” \nand Citibank “shall not be responsible” for determining whether Climate United’s requests for the \ndisbursement of grant funds comply with any applicable contracts or laws. ACA at 3. \n80.  EPA (as Secured Party under the ACA), has not notified Citibank of any intention \nto exercise exclusive control over Climate United’s accounts or provided Citibank with a Notice \nof Exclusive Control. Indeed, there is no factual basis to support such a notice.  \n81.  EPA has not “issued a written determination and finding that [Climate United] has \nfailed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and that noncompliance \nis substantial such that effective performance of the Grant Agreement is materially impaired or \nthere is adequate evidence of waste, fraud, material misrepresentation of eligibility status, or \nabuse.” ACA Exhibit A. Indeed, there is no factual basis to support such a written determination \nor finding. \n82.  EPA has not “initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or partly suspend or \nterminate the Grant Agreement, as authorized in the terms of the Grant Agreement.” Indeed, there \nis no factual basis to support such an action.  \n83.  By failing to disburse grant funds held in Climate United’s accounts, Citibank has \nbreached the ACA. \n84.  Citibank’s failure to disburse funds, as required under the ACA, has caused damage \nto Climate United. Such damage has resulted solely from Citibank’s own gross negligence or \nwillful misconduct. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 30 of 35\n \n85.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that \nCitibank’s failure to disburse funds from Climate United’s accounts is a breach of the ACA. \n86.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful refusal to \nhonor Climate United’s disbursement requests. \nCOUNT TWO: REPLEVIN \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n87.  Climate  United  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n88.  Climate United has an immediate legal right to possess the grant funds that Climate \nUnited lawfully requested that Citibank disburse from Climate United’s accounts, pursuant to the \nACA, on February 18, February 21, and thereafter. \n89.  Citibank has wrongfully detained the grant funds by unlawfully failing to disburse \nthe grant funds that Climate United lawfully requested on February 18, February 21, and thereafter. \n90.  Citibank’s intentional actions have caused damage to Climate United. \nCOUNT THREE: CONVERSION \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n91.  Climate  United  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n92.  Climate United has a legal right to possess and control the grant funds held in its \naccounts at Citibank, pursuant to the ACA. \n93.  Citibank has wrongfully and intentionally exercised dominion or control over the \ngrant funds in Climate United’s accounts, including by failing to disburse grant funds to Climate \nUnited from Climate United’s accounts in response to Climate United’s valid and proper requests. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 31 of 35\n \n94.  Citibank has intentionally permanently or substantially interfered with Climate \nUnited’s property rights, including by failing to disburse grant funds to Climate United from \nClimate United’s accounts in response to Climate United’s valid and proper requests. \n95.  Citibank has acted without Climate United’s consent and has no legal basis or valid \njustification for its actions. \n96.  Citibank’s intentional actions have caused damage to Climate United. \n97.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful retention of \nCitibank’s funds. \n98.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that \nCitibank’s failure to disburse funds from Climate United’s accounts constitutes a conversion of \nClimate United’s funds.  \nCOUNT FOUR: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n   \n99.  Climate  United  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n100.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n101.  By causing Citibank to withhold Climate United’s grant funds, EPA has effectuated \na suspension or termination of Climate United’s grant. \n102.  Defendants’ suspension or termination of Climate United’s grant constitutes final \nagency action under the APA. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 32 of 35\n \n103.  Defendants’ suspension or termination of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law because, among other things: \na.  EPA  has  not  provided  an  adequate  or  reasoned  basis  for  its  suspension  or \ntermination of the grant. Nor could it, as there is no factual basis for the suspension \nor termination of the grant. \nb.  EPA’s suspension or termination of the grant violates the statute establishing the \ngrant fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434.  \nc.  EPA’s suspension or termination of the grant violates federal appropriations law, \nwhich legally requires EPA to spend the funds appropriated for distribution under \nthe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434, because EPA has not \nsatisfied the stringent requirements for rescinding an appropriation under 2 U.S.C. \n§ 683. \nd.  EPA’s suspension or termination of the grant violates EPA regulations and Uniform \nGrant Guidance regulations codified at 2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq., which do not allow \nEPA  to  suspend  funding  or  to  terminate  Climate  United’s  grant  under  these \ncircumstances. \ne.  EPA’s  suspension  or  termination  of  the  grant  has  not  complied  with  EPA’s \nregulatory  obligation  to  take  certain  procedural  steps  to  terminate  the  grant \nagreement, such as providing written notice of termination that includes “the \nreasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to \nbe terminated, if applicable.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.341.  \nf.  EPA’s  suspension  or  termination  of  the  grant  has  resulted  in  improperly \nwithholding payment for allowable costs without establishing that Climate United \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 33 of 35\n \nhas either “failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or \nis “delinquent in a debt to the United States.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6). Indeed, \nthere is no factual basis for EPA to make such a showing. \ng.  EPA’s  suspension  or  termination  of  the  grant  has  resulted  in  improperly \nwithholding payment without first making a “determin[ation] that noncompliance \ncannot be remedied by imposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.339.  \n104.  As a result of Defendants’ conduct, Climate United has suffered and will continue \nto suffer irreparable injury.  \n105.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n106.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that \nDefendants’ suspension and termination of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nand otherwise not in accordance with law. \nCOUNT FIVE: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n107.  Climate  United  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every \nallegation contained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n108.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government may \nnot deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest without due process of law. \n109.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326–27 (2015). \n110.  Climate United has a protected property interest in the grant funds it was awarded \nunder the NCIF and which were disbursed into its accounts at Citibank. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 34 of 35\n \n111.  Defendants suspended or terminated Climate United’s grant without providing \nnotice or an opportunity to be heard.  \n112.  Climate United is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n113.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Climate United is entitled to a declaration that \nDefendants’ suspension and termination of the grant violated due process of law. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Climate United respectfully asks this Court: \n1.  Declare that Citibank’s failure to disburse grant funds from Climate United’s \naccounts is a breach of the ACA; \n2.  Order Citibank to comply with its contractual obligations under the ACA, including \nby disbursing grant funds to which Climate United is entitled at Climate United’s \nrequest in accordance with the ACA, both with respect to requests Climate United \nhas already submitted and future requests; \n3.  Declare that EPA and Administrator Zeldin’s suspension or termination of the grant \nviolates the Administrative Procedure Act; \n4.  Declare that EPA and Administrator Zeldin’s actions violate the Due Process \nClause; \n5.  Enjoin EPA, Administrator Zeldin, and others in active concert or participation \ntherewith, from impeding Citibank from complying with its contractual obligations, \nor  otherwise  causing  Citibank  to  deny,  obstruct,  delay,  or  otherwise  prevent \nClimate United from accessing its funds as permitted under the terms of the ACA \nand the grant award;  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 1     Filed 03/08/25     Page 35 of 35\n \n6.  Enjoin EPA and Administrator Zeldin from unlawfully suspending or terminating \nClimate United’s grant award except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the \ngrant award, and applicable law; \n7.  Grant such other and further relief as may be just and proper.  \n \nDated: March 8, 2025  Respectfully submitted:  \n/s/  Adam G. Unikowsky     \nGabriel K.

At the threshold, Tarek Farag (hereinafter “Proposed \nIntervenor”) must establish Article III standing for intervention under either standard. Proposed \nIntervenor fails to do this. \nProposed Intervenor may not intervene as of right because he has not shown an interest \nrelating to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action. Instead, his most direct \ninterest is in not paying taxes or utility fees that he attributes to climate science broadly, which \nhe believes is a hoax. This lawsuit will not impede his ability to pursue claims related to this \ninterest elsewhere.   \nProposed Intervenor also fails to show that he qualifies for permissive intervention. The \nmotion reveals no independent subject matter jurisdiction for his claims. He also presents no \nquestion of fact or law in common with the claims already involved in the case. Accordingly, the \nmotion to intervene should be denied. \nARGUMENT \nIntervention as a matter of right should be granted when a federal statute gives the \nproposed intervenor an unconditional right to intervene by statute. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(1). \nAlternatively, a proposed intervenor must demonstrate:  \n(1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) that the applicant “claims an interest relating to \nthe property or transaction which is the subject of the action”; (3) that the applicant is \nso situated that the disposition of the action may as a practical matter impair or \nimpede the applicant’s ability to protect that interest”; and (4) that “the applicant’s \ninterest is [not] adequately represented by existing parties.”  \nFund for Animals, Inc. v. Norton, 322 F.3d 728, 731 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2).  \n5 \n \n\n  Rule 24(b) sets forth the standard for permissive intervention. “If a federal statute does not \nconfer a conditional right to intervene, Rule 24(b)(2) requires a would-be intervenor to present \n‘(1) an independent ground for subject matter jurisdiction; (2) a timely motion; and (3) a claim or \ndefense that has a question of law or fact in common with the main action.’” Envt’l Def. v. \nLeavitt, 329 F. Supp. 2d 55, 66 (D. D.C. 2004) (citing Equal Employment Opportunity Comm'n \nv. Nat'l Children's Ctr., Inc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C.Cir. 1998)). \n  Additionally, a proposed intervenor under Rule 24 must demonstrate Article III standing. \nYoha Dehe v. United States Dep’t of the Interior, 3 F.4th 427 (D.C. Cir. 2021); Roeder v. Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, 333 F.3d 228, 233-234 (D.C. Cir. 2003).   \nI.  THE PROPOSED INTERVENOR LACKS ARTICLE III STANDING. \n  The Proposed Intervenor’s motion should be denied because he lacks standing to intervene \nin this case. “[W]here a party tries to intervene as another defendant, [courts] have required it to \ndemonstrate Article III standing, reasoning that otherwise ‘any organization or individual with \nonly a philosophic identification with a defendant---or a concern with a possible unfavorable \nprecedent---could attempt to intervene and influence the course of litigation.” Crossroads \nGrassroots Policy Strategies v. Fed’l Elec. Comm’n, 788 F.3d 312, 316 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(internal quotations and citation omitted). As with other litigants, to meet Article III standing \nrequirements, a proposed intervenor must establish (1) injury-in-fact, (2) causation, and \n(3) redressability. Fund for Animals, 322 F.3d at 732-33; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, \n504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). Here, Proposed Intervenor has at best a philosophic identification \nwith the defendant and has shown no injury-in-fact related to the nucleus of facts in this case. \nAccordingly, he fails to meet Article III standing requirements. \n  Proposed Intervenor shows no injury. He states that he has an interest in this case because \nthe funds at stake are his money. Mot., ECF 72, at 3-4. This purported interest stems from being \na taxpayer and his desire to not pay additional fees or higher prices to fund clean energy, as \nillustrated by his electric bill. Mot., ECF 72, at 4. But taxpayer standing of the type that the \napplicant alleges does not establish a “concrete and particularized” injury sufficient to invoke \n6 \n \n\nfederal jurisdiction. DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.S. 332, 345 (2006) (citation \nomitted); see also Concerned Household Elec. Consumers Council v. EPA, No. 22-1139, 2023 \nWL 3643436, at *2 (D.C. Cir. May 25, 2023) (dismissing challenge to climate science for lack of \nstanding based on paying electricity bills). As the Supreme Court has noted, “‘interests of a \ntaxpayer in the moneys of the federal treasury are too indeterminable, remote, uncertain and \nindirect’ to support standing to challenge ‘their manner of expenditure.’” Id. Nor does Plaintiff \nidentify how the relief requested in this case could cause any future injury to Proposed \nIntervenor. Cf. Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, 788 F.3d at 317-18.   \n  Proposed Intervenor also fails to meet the “causation” prong of standing analysis. \nPlaintiffs’ win or loss in this case would not impact any of his stated interests. His asserted \ngeneral interest in proving that climate change is a “hoax” is also far too attenuated. Even if he \nwere to prove this (and this is not one of the legal issues currently before the Court), it would not \ndirectly affect any of his concrete interests. See Deutsche Bank Nat’l Trust Co. v. F.D.I.C., 717 \nF.3d 189, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (potential intervenor-defendant’s claim of injury too attenuated to \nconstitute injury because the intervenor’s interest would only be at stake if the court reached a \nparticular legal conclusion).  \n  Relatedly, the remedy Proposed Intervenor seeks would not redress his injuries. Proposed \nIntervenor claims that “[t]he impact of these cases, goes far beyond its parties, and could legalize \nthe illegal.” Mot., ECF 72, at 4 (emphasis in original). As an example, he points to the fees on \nhis utilities bill. Id. However, for the outcome of this case to have any impact on Proposed \nIntervenor’s interests, intervening actors would need to take several additional actions that would \nnot be controlled by this lawsuit. Accordingly, Proposed Intervenor has failed to show how this \nCourt could enter any relief to redress his articulated injuries. \nII.  INTERVENTION UNDER FEDERAL RULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 24(A). \nAlthough Proposed Intervenor claims to have an unconditional right to intervene under \nRule 24(a)(1), he does not cite any statute or other authority for this position. Accordingly, the \nCourt should analyze his motion to intervene using the factors set forth in Rule 24(a)(2). Fund \n7 \n \n\nfor Animals, 322 F.3d at 731. The Court should deny the motion to intervene because although \nthe application is timely, it fails to demonstrate any legally recognized interest in the property or \ntransactions that are the subject of his case, and as a practical matter, this case would not impede \nany of the Proposed Intervenor’s interests. Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a)(2). \nA.  Timeliness \nPlaintiff State Green Banks do not contest the timeliness of the motion to intervene.  \nB.  Proposed Intervenor does not claim an interest relating to the property or \ntransaction which is the subject of the action. \nTo intervene, an applicant must have an interest that relates to the subject of an action. An \nintervenor satisfies this prerequisite “not [by] any interest the applicant can put forward, but only \n[by] a legally protectable one.” Roane v. Gonzales, 269 F.R.D. 1, 3 (D.D.C. 2010) (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted). A legally protectable interest is “of such a direct and \nimmediate character that the intervenor will either gain or lose by the direct legal operation and \neffect of the judgment.” United States v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 642 F.2d 1285, 1291–92 (D.C. Cir. \n1980). Proposed Intervenor has no interest in the property or transaction that is the subject of the \naction: He has no property interest in the funds held in the Citibank accounts at issue, he has no \nprotectible interest in EPA’s actions against the program or funds at issue in this case, the \nprojects that will be funded by them, or the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.  \nProposed Intervenor quotes Nuesse v. Camp, 385 F.2d 694, 700 (D.C. Cir. 1967), for the \nproposition that courts should allow “as many apparently concerned persons [to intervene] as is \ncompatible with efficiency and due process.” Mot., ECF 72, at 3. The intervenor in Nuesse was a \nstate bank regulator who moved to intervene because he wanted to “appear as a party to urge the \nconstruction of the federal statute that he claims is necessary to secure the state’s interests.” Id. at \n701. Here, although the applicant claims scientific expertise in matters that be believes are \nrelated to this lawsuit, he asserts no interest in any legal matter that would actually be affected, \neven indirectly, by the legal claims likely to be addressed by this lawsuit. Accordingly, the \napplication fails to show a sufficient interest to intervene in this matter. \n8 \n \n\nC.  The disposition of the action does not, as a practical matter, impede \nProposed Intervenor’s ability to protect his interest. \nThe application also fails to show that the case will interfere with Proposed Intervenor’s \nability to protect his interests. In assessing whether an applicant’s interests may be impaired by \nthe outcome of a lawsuit, courts look to the “practical consequences of denying intervention, \neven where the possibility of future challenge to the regulation remain[s] available.” Fund for \nAnimals, 322 F.3d at 735 (cleaned up). Here, Proposed Intervenor does not have any specific \ninterest in defending Federal Defendants or Citibank against Plaintiffs’ challenge, nor will he be \nharmed by the Plaintiffs having access to their grant funds to complete their projects.  \nInstead, Proposed Intervenor’s specific interest is in demonstrating that climate change is a \nhoax, invalidating all orders and laws that rely on it, and “to stop paying money to enforce the \nHoax.” Mot., ECF 72, at 4. His requested relief is for this Court to “(1) Declare that the claims \nthat burning fossil fuel generating CO2 could cause global warming have no scientific basis” and \n“(2) Invalidate all administrative orders, laws, subsidiaries, etc. to combat Man-Made-Global-\nWarming, or promote Zero-Carbon emission that are not based on solid science.” Proposed \nPleadings, ECF 72, ¶ 15. The foundational science of climate change and all administrative \norders and laws related to it are not subjects of this litigation. As a result, the outcome of this \ncase will not impact Proposed Intervenor’s ability to pursue his claims in a different lawsuit. \nD.  Applicant’s interest is adequately represented by the existing parties. \nProposed Intervenor has no legally cognizable interest in the property or transaction that is \nthe subject of this litigation, and disposition of this action will not impede his ability to protect \nhis interests as a practical matter. Accordingly, he has no greater interest in this litigation than \nany other person, and his interests will be adequately represented by the existing parties.  \nIII.  PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION \nWhere an applicant fails to satisfy the conditions for intervention as of right, the Court may \ngrant a timely motion to an applicant intervenor who “has a claim or defense that shares with the \nmain action a common question of law or fact.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b)(1). The applicant must also \nshow an independent ground for subject matter jurisdiction. E.E.O.C. v. Nat'l Children's Ctr., \n9 \n \n\nInc., 146 F.3d 1042, 1046 (D.C.Cir.1998)). In exercising its discretion to determine whether to \nallow permissive intervention, the Court should consider whether the intervention will unduly \ndelay or prejudice the adjudication of the original parties’ rights.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b). \nUltimately, even if a would-be intervenor has established the factors to consider for permissive \nintervention, it is within the court’s discretion whether to grant permission to intervene. Nat’l \nChildren’s Ctr., 146 F.3d at 1048.  \nProposed Intervenor fails to point to any statute conferring upon him an individual right to \nintervene. Accordingly, for the Court to grant the applicant permissive intervention, he must first \nsatisfy the three-factor test set forth in Rule 24(b)(2). Although the motion to intervene is timely, \nProposed Intervenor fails to meet the necessary conditions in the other two factors.  \nAs to the first factor, Proposed Intervenor does not identify an independent basis for \nsubject matter jurisdiction. His pleadings ask this Court to “[i]nvalidate all administrative orders, \nlaws, subsidiaries, etc. to combat Man-Made-Global-Warming, or promote Zero-Carbon \nemission, that are not based on solid science.” Proposed Pleading, ECF 72, ¶ 15. But the \nproposed pleadings contain no citations to violations of federal law, or any law for that matter. \nInstead, the pleadings almost entirely contain a summary of the proposed presentation that he \nwould offer, ostensibly as an expert in the case. Proposed Pleadings, ECF 72, ¶¶ 3-13. As the \napplicant has not shown any independent basis for this Court’s subject matter jurisdiction over \nhis claims and he lacks Article III standing (supra, at pp. 6-7), the first factor for permissive \nintervention is not met. \nAs to the third factor, Proposed Intervenor does not present a claim that has a question of \nlaw or fact in common with the main action. Proposed Intervenor claims that he “shares a \ncommon question of fact ‘burning fossil fuel does not cause global warning,’ which is the basis \nfor the fraudulent allocation of [the grant awards in this case].” Mot., ECF 72, at 6. But this is not \none of the questions presented by this case. Neither Federal Defendants nor Citibank have \nindicated that they will defend this case by attempting to prove climate change a “hoax.” See \nFed. Def.’s Opp. to Mot. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF 49, at 8-20; Citibank’s Response to \n10 \n \n\nMot. for Preliminary Injunction, ECF 48, at 12-16. See also Deus v. Allstate Ins. Co., 15 F.3d \n506, 525 (5th Cir.1994) (“The intervention rule is . . . not intended to allow the creation of whole \nnew lawsuits by the intervenors.”). \nEven if the above factors for permissive intervention were met, the Court would be well \nwithin its discretion to deny intervention here. Nat’l Children’s Ctr., 146 F.3d 1046, 1048 \n(describing permissive intervention as an “inherently discretionary enterprise. As Proposed \nIntervenor’s proposed pleadings make clear, the actual role he seeks is not intervenor-defendant, \nbut instead expert witness. Intervention under Rule 24 is not the appropriate method for \nobtaining that role.

In the consolidated NCIF cases, the EPA Defendants (but not Citibank) have now \nmoved to stay any preliminary injunction this Court issues in favor of the NCIF grantees.  The \nEPA Defendants do not mention JCF in their stay motion.  But, to the extent the EPA Defendants \nintend that any preliminary relief favoring JCF also be stayed, the Court should deny that \nmotion.  The EPA Defendants misstate the harm to EPA.  They drastically understate the damage \nto JCF and its subgrantees from a stay of any preliminary relief, as is starkly illustrated by the \nattached declaration of Dr. Reginald Parker.  And they err in analogizing this case to the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decision in U.S. Department of Education v. California, S. Ct. No. 24A910 (April \n4, 2025).  Even if this Court were to issue a stay, it (1) should not apply to Citibank, which has \nnot moved for a stay; (2) should not apply to any order enjoining EPA Defendants or Citibank \nfrom seeking to move money from JCF’s Citibank account; and (3) should not apply to any order \nenjoining EPA Defendants or Citibank from denying JCF access to its Citibank account for \npurposes of paying its operational expenses.1 \nARGUMENT \nI.  EPA Defendants Overstate The Government’s Harm. \nContrary to their motion, EPA Defendants are not seeking to avoid disbursing \ngovernment funds; they are seeking to improperly claw back money that the government already \nawarded and distributed to JCF.  The government completely ignores this critical difference.  \n \n1 For purposes of the merits, JCF rests on the arguments in the preliminary injunction papers. \n1 \n \n\nThe funds at issue were appropriated by Congress through the Inflation Reduction Act.  \n42 U.S.C. § 7434.  They were then awarded to JCF through an extremely competitive and \ntransparent process.  And once EPA selected JCF as an awardee, EPA transferred the funds to \nJCF, where they were placed in a Citibank account in JCF’s name and with JCF as the Pledgor.  \nAs detailed in JCF’s memorandum in support of its preliminary injunction motion, that account \nis governed by an Account Control Agreement (ACA) between EPA, JCF, and Citibank that \ngives JCF control over the funds in the account.  The ACA gives EPA a security interest in the \nfunds, but gives EPA no other rights in the absence of a Notice of Exclusive Control, which EPA \nhas not issued (and lacks the basis to issue with respect to JCF).  Until EPA takes those steps, the \nfunds must be distributed in accordance with any JCF directions that comply with the law and \nthe governing contracts. Accordingly, the status quo is that JCF has access to those funds, and it \nis EPA who is trying to seize JCF’s money, not the other way around. \nEPA Defendants also dramatically overstate the extent to which this case is about \n“safeguarding the public fisc.”  Motion at 10.  For one thing, applicable federal regulations \nrequire that Citibank pledge collateral security for the ACA funds; this collateralization gives the \nU.S. government what the Treasury already has determined by regulation is adequate protection \nin case the money were to be misused.  See 31 C.F.R. § 202.6.   \nMaking matters worse for EPA Defendants, they have effectively abandoned any pretense \nthat their attempt to terminate JCF’s grant is based on any kind of misfeasance on JCF’s part.  \nInstead, at the preliminary injunction hearing, EPA Defendants justified their attempt to seize \nJCF’s money as being based entirely on a change in priorities from the prior Presidential \nAdministration.  Putting aside that such a change in priorities is not a valid basis for terminating \nJCF’s grant award, it also does not suggest any threat to “the public fisc.”   \n2 \n \n\nTo be sure, EPA’s change in priorities purports to focus, in part, on the relevant “level of \noversight and control” that EPA Defendants would like to have.  Motion at 10.  But EPA has \nidentified no evidence—none—that JCF has misused its funds in any way or that the current \nlevel of oversight and control creates any meaningful risk that JCF will misuse its funds in any \nway.  The only risk to the government is thus that some fraction of JCF’s funds might actually be \nused in the manner intended by EPA itself when EPA awarded JCF its grant after an extensive \nand transparent application process.  That is hardly the type of irreparable harm that justifies any \ndelay in enjoining EPA’s blatantly unlawful attempt to terminate JCF’s grant award and deprive \nJCF of its ability to access its funds and carry out its mission. \nRelatedly, the EPA made clear at the hearing that what it thinks it will lose if this Court \ngrants preliminary relief is its “right” to “breach” the contract governing JCF’s account.  But that \nis wrong:  What the EPA is ultimately trying to do here is control not its own behavior, but the \nbehavior of two other, private parties (JCF and Citibank), without seeking a court order of its \nown—or exercising any other lawful authority to which it can point.  Accordingly, the relief JCF \nrequests here amounts to nothing more than a confirmation of the status quo, and a direction to \nCitibank to discharge its preexisting contractual duties (which Citibank has not sought to stay).  \nHad the government done what this Court suggested at the hearing and sought its own court \norder directing the freezing or return of the funds, it could perhaps seek an injunction pending \nappeal upon failing to receive the intervention it wanted.  But it cannot claim irreparable harm \nfrom the fact that it could lose immediate access to money already held by another for the benefit \nof another without identifying any legal basis whatsoever on which it should be returned or \nJCF’s access to it should be curtailed. \n3 \n \n\nII.  Staying JCF's Ability To Carry Out Its Program Would Cause Irreparable Harm To \nJCF And Its Subgrantees. \nEPA Defendants argue that plaintiffs will not be harmed “for one simple reason: This case \nis about money.”  Motion at 10.  But at least JCF’s case is not actually about money.  JCF is a \nnonprofit that stands to make no money at all.  JCF was formed in 2023, after the passage of the \nIRA, by a coalition of organizations with extensive experience advancing community-\ndevelopment finance for unbanked American families, businesses, and communities. JCF’s \nfounding organizations sought to utilize CCIA funding to fill a critical gap for community \nlenders: Many community lenders were underrepresented in affordable clean energy and housing \nfinance that advances community health, security and prosperity. By forming JCF, coalition \nmembers aimed to centralize support and technical assistance, ensure that resources would flow \nto community lenders not served, and help lenders build capacity through experience with JCF’s \nsmall-scale funding. \nThis case is about whether JCF can carry out that mission.  And if JCF does not regain \naccess to its awarded funds in the very near future—both for operational and programmatic \ncosts—it will almost certainly fail.  That will lead to irreparable harm twice over.  First, JCF will \nbe forced to simply close, terminating its employees and abandoning all of its subgrantees.  EPA \nDefendants completely ignore this in their purported equitable balancing. \nSecond, in closing, JCF will lose the ability to carry out its mission, consistent with \ncongressional intent, to disburse obligated funds to community lenders pursuant to its closely \nvetted workplan.  JCF’s inability to carry out its mission would also irreparably harm its \nsubgrantee community lenders and, by extension, members of communities that would be served \nby projects those community lenders would finance. \n4 \n \n\nJCF relies on its awarded funds—held in Citibank accounts in JCF’s own name—for its \noperating expenses.  See Declaration of Amir Kirkwood (“Kirkwood Decl.”) ¶ 30, Justice \nClimate Fund v. EPA, No. 25-cv-938 (D.D.C. Apr. 2, 2025), ECF No. 7-2.  Without access to \nthose funds, JCF will run out of money to fund its operations in roughly 33 days.  Id. ¶¶ 30, 34.  \nThe financial harm that would result from a stay “threatens the very existence of [JCF’s] \nbusiness” and is irreparable.  Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985). \nJust as importantly, if JCF does not soon regain the ability to disburse obligated funds to \nits subgrantees, JCF’s ability to fulfill its mission will be harmed beyond repair.  Consistent with \nthe design of the CCIA program and the meticulous workplan on which EPA has signed off, JCF \nhas selected 35 community lenders to receive CCIA funds to support numerous projects.  \nKirkwood Decl. ¶¶ 8, 17.  The disbursement of funds to community lenders, who then finance \ngreen projects in low-income and disadvantaged communities, is the work EPA awarded JCF \ncongressionally appropriated funds to do, pursuant to a congressional mandate.  If JCF continues \nto be unable to disburse the funds it has obligated, it necessarily cannot do that work.  Moreover, \neven if funding were to be restored in the future, the reputational harms to JCF that are now \nresulting will soon become insurmountable.  Many community lenders were already hesitant to \nparticipate in the GGRF program due to fears of being targeted, but JCF built trust-based \nrelationships with community-lending partners, and together with them, created project \npipelines.  See Kirkwood Decl. ¶¶ 41-42.  The reputational damage of breaking that trust—as by \nnot disbursing obligated funds on promised timelines—will be exceedingly difficult to repair.  Id. \n¶ 42.  If the funds are not accessible soon, the damage will be irreparable.  Id.  \nIf funding is not restored soon, the harm to JCF’s subgrantees will be similarly \nirreparable.  JCF’s network of community lenders have acted in reliance on JCF’s ability to \n5 \n \n\ndisburse the promised funds, including by approving applications for low-cost financing of \nprojects that would result in monetary savings, energy independence, and job creation in low-\nincome communities.  See Kirkwood Decl. ¶ 37; Declaration of Dr. Reginald Parker (“Parker \nDecl.”) ¶¶ 11-16, 19-20, 23 (submitted herewith as Exhibit A).  For example, Freedmen Green \nBank & Trust (“Freedmen”), which serves communities in Georgia, Mississippi, and Alabama, \nParker Decl. ¶ 2, provides “affordable financing of residential, small-business, and community \nprojects, including weatherization, building-upgrade, and clean-energy projects,” id. ¶ 11.  \nFreedmen “approved the applications of numerous project sponsors for low-cost financing for \ntheir qualified projects,” id. ¶ 23, but has not received funds JCF obligated to it for technical \nassistance—essentially, operating capital.  Id. ¶ 17-18.  “Unless those funds are restored soon, \nFreedmen will be unable to continue in operation.”  Id. ¶ 18. \nMembers of the communities that would be served by community lenders like Freedmen \nwill be seriously and irreparably harmed if JCF’s access to its funding is not restored soon.  \nJCF’s network of community lenders finance projects that would reduce low-income families’ \nenergy expenditures and provide energy independence, ensuring that lights, heat, and air \nconditioning stay on during blackouts.  Parker Decl. ¶¶ 13-14, 35-37.  But funding delays, like \nthose that have resulted from the freezing of JCF’s funds, carry follow-on effects that make \nprojects substantially more difficult or even impossible to complete, even when funding is \nrestored.  See id. ¶¶ 29-33.  Unless JCF regains access to its awarded funds soon, projects that \nwould provide significant benefits to the communities who most need them will never be \ncompleted. \nIII.  The Supreme Court’s Order in DOE v. California Is Not Analogous. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent order in Department of Education v. California is not \nanalogous here for at least two reasons.  First, any injunction that gives JCF access to its \n6 \n \n\nCitibank funds would not be an order to “pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue \npaying obligations as they accrue.”  24A910 at 1.  Instead, any such injunction would simply \ngive JCF access to the funds that are already in its own bank account because EPA has not taken \nthe contractually required steps to exercise exclusive control over those funds, has not sought a \ncourt order freezing those funds in place, and has not identified any possible legal authority for \nseizing or freezing those funds.  Second, EPA Defendants have not “compellingly argue[d] that \nrespondents would not suffer irreparable harm while the TRO is stayed.”  24A910 at 2.  In DOE \nv. California, the state plaintiffs “represented in this litigation that they have the financial \nwherewithal to keep their programs running.”  Id.  That was a crucial reason why the Supreme \nCourt concluded that an injunction was unnecessary while the case proceeded.  Here, by contrast, \nJCF (and the other plaintiffs) have submitted compelling evidence that they would have to close \ntheir doors absent an injunction and would not be able to litigate the case to completion.  And \nthat is in addition to the significant reputational and other harm they would suffer.  In that way, \ntoo, this case is fundamentally different than DOE v. California. \nIV.  Any Stay Should Be Limited In Three Key Ways. \nTo the extent this Court issues a stay, it should be limited in three key ways. \nFirst, it should not apply to Citibank, which has not sought a stay of any injunction.  If \nCitibank moves to stay any preliminary injunction this Court issues, this Court can address that \nmotion when it is filed.  Notably, however, the government has identified no likelihood of \nsuccess apart from a jurisdictional argument that does not apply to Citibank.  So even assuming \nthat Citibank did seek a stay, it would almost certainly be impossible for it to establish a \nlikelihood of success. \nSecond, it should not apply to any order enjoining EPA Defendants or Citibank from \nseeking to move money from JCF’s Citibank account.  EPA Defendants identify no basis for \n7 \n \n\nallowing them to take money out of JCF’s account while this litigation is pending and no \npossible irreparable harm that might accrue to the government from leaving those funds where \nthey have been for many months. \nThird, it should not apply to any order enjoining EPA Defendants or Citibank from \ndenying JCF access to its Citibank account for purposes of paying its operational expenses.  EPA \nDefendants’ motion is based effectively entirely on the need to avoid the withdrawals it \nidentifies, which relate to program distributions not operational expenses. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, the Court should deny the Federal Defendants’ Contingent Emergency \nMotion for Stay Pending Appeal.  \n \nDated: April 15, 2025     Respectfully submitted, \n          /s/ Eric F.

Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009) (cleaned up).  EPA has not shown that \ndeviation from the ordinary process is warranted in this case. \nI.  The Government’s Motion Is Not Ripe \nThe Government’s motion should be denied on the basis that it is not ripe, without prejudice \nto refiling once the Court issues its order on Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion.  FRAP 8 \nrequires appellants to seek a stay from the District Court before requesting the same stay from the \nCourt of Appeals.  The Government may not circumvent that requirement by filing a supposed \ncontingent stay application before the Court has even entered an order that may be appealed.  See \nNat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, 2025 WL 597959, at *19 n.14 (D.D.C. Feb. \n25, 2025) (“The court also denies Defendants’ request for an administrative stay pending appeal \nas premature. If Defendants, after reviewing this opinion and its accompanying order, believe that \na stay pending appeal is warranted, they may make a request consistent with Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 8.” (cleaned up)). \nII.  EPA Is Not Entitled To A Stay \nA.  EPA Has Failed To Make a Strong Showing That They Are Likely to \nSucceed On Appeal \nFor the reasons already stated in Plaintiffs’ prior briefing, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non the merits of their claims against all Defendants.  See Dkt. 33-1 at 27-44, 56-59; Dkt. 53 at 11-\n22, 27-29.  And, for the reasons stated in Plaintiffs’ prior briefing on the preliminary injunction \nmotion and supplemental briefing on jurisdiction, this Court has jurisdiction over all of Plaintiffs’ \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 3 of 11\nclaims.  See Dkt. 64; Dkt. 33-1 at 22-26; Dkt. 53 at 3-11.  See also Memorandum Opinion and \nOrder at 28-35, Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council, C.A. No. 1:25-cv-00097-MSM-PAS \n(D.R.I.) (entered April 15, 2025) (“a single three-page per curiam order [in Department of \nEducation] granting a stay” cannot be construed as overruling Bowen and its progeny). \nB.  EPA Will Not Be Irreparably Harmed Absent a Stay \nBecause EPA has not shown a likelihood of success on any appeal, or even serious \nquestions as to whether it will prevail, a stay may not issue regardless of whether or not they have \nsubstantiated irreparable harm.  See Blankenship v. Boyle, 447 F.2d 1280, 1280 (D.C. Cir. 1971).   \nEPA also has not shown irreparable harm. To obtain a stay pending appeal, the mere \n“possibility of irreparable injury” to the moving party is not sufficient.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n418, 434-35 (2009).  If the movant fails to make the threshold showing of irreparable injury, a stay \nmay not issue.  KalshiEX LLC v. CFTC, 119 F.4th 58, 64 (D.C. Cir. 2024).   \nEPA claims that Plaintiffs “may immediately attempt to move approximately $625 million \nand all $14 billion could be equally subject to loss.”  But EPA provides no reason to conclude that \nthe $625 million in already-requested funds is going to be spent in a fraudulent or wasteful way.  \nTo the contrary, EPA disregards the multitude of safeguards EPA imposed on Appellees’ accounts \nto provide transparency and allow for oversight.  See, e.g., Dkt. 33-1 at 12.  Indeed, each and every \nexpense for which Plaintiffs and their subgrantees sought to draw funds was legitimate and \njustified.  See, e.g., Declaration of Elizabeth Bafford in Opposition to Motion for Stay ¶ 3 & Exhibit \nA; Dkt. 33-2 (Decl. of Elizabeth Bafford) ¶ 34; Dkt. 33-32 (Decl. of John Moon) ¶ 12; Dkt. 33-27 \n(Decl. of Eli Hopson) ¶ 13; Dkt. 33-26 (Decl. of Jessica Buendia) ¶ 13.  \nMoreover, EPA overlooks that even in its best-case scenario, it will be liable for a damages \njudgment anyway—that judgment will merely be issued by the Court of Federal Claims in a \nbreach-of-contract action.  Notably, EPA has never disputed that the grants were terminated \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 4 of 11\nillegally.  If Plaintiffs are forced to bring breach-of-contract claims in the Court of Federal Claims, \nPlaintiffs are virtually guaranteed to prevail.  EPA is not harmed by purported loss of funds when \nit will have to pay Plaintiffs money judgments anyway. \nIt is particularly clear that EPA will not be harmed with respect to the funds that Plaintiffs \nattempted to draw from their accounts before EPA sent each Plaintiff a Notice of Termination.  As \nreflected in an exhibit to Federal Defendants’ temporary restraining order opposition, Citibank \nreceived approximately $450 million in pending transfer instructions from the prime GGRF \nrecipients and subrecipients by March 6, 2025, before EPA issued its Notices of Termination on \nMarch 11, 2025.  See Dkt. 16-2 at 169 (Citibank stating that, as of March 6, “the Bank has \napproximately  $450  million  in  pending  transfer  instructions  from  the  prime  recipients  and \nsubrecipients.”).  But EPA has offered no justification for its actions withholding properly \nrequested funds from Plaintiffs prior to EPA’s purported termination of Plaintiffs’ grants.  EPA is \nnot “irreparably harmed” if Plaintiffs receive funds when EPA has never even tried to justify its \nactions preventing Plaintiffs from obtaining those funds.   \nEPA also claims that without a stay, it would not be able to “complete the closeout process, \nreform the program, and reobligate the funds … until this cloud on the funding is removed.”  Mot. \n9-10.  But a temporary “cloud” on funding is not an irreparable harm: if EPA ultimately prevails \nin this case, the “cloud” will go away.  Further, the government “cannot suffer harm from an \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 \n(D.D.C. 2015) (quoting Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013)); see also \nGordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (holding that plaintiff’s interest in enjoining \nunlawful action superseded governmental interest in continuing that action). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 5 of 11\nC.  The Equities Weigh Against A Stay \nIn contrast to the minimal—and certainly not irreparable—harm Federal Defendants would \nexperience if a stay were denied, the harm to Plaintiffs if a stay were granted would be catastrophic.  \nPlaintiffs have amply corroborated the severe threat continued lack of access to NCIF funds poses \nto their operations, programs, and reputations.   \nThis Court has already recognized that financial harm can “constitute irreparable harm … \nwhere the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s business.”  Dkt. 28 at 19 (quoting Wisc. \nGas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). Climate United and PFC have substantiated \nin detail the existential risks they face without access to funding in the near future.  See, e.g., Dkt. \n33-1 at 44-47, 51-52.  Climate United is also submitting a supplemental declaration with this \nresponse describing the ongoing harm to Climate United and explaining how it will suffer acute \nharm if a stay pending appeal is granted.   \nEach Plaintiff has also corroborated significant and ongoing harm to its operations, its \nprograms, and its reputation and goodwill.  See, e.g., Dkt. 33-1 at 44-54.  These include the \ninability to finance projects that have already been launched; being forced to reduce staff or defer \ncompensation; being unable to compensate essential contractors; and being told by current and \nprospective partners that they will not engage with a given Plaintiff while its access to funds is \nuncertain.  All of these harms are also more than sufficient not just to justify a preliminary \ninjunction, but to counterweight Federal Defendants’ questionable assertions of irreparable harm. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs have continued to suffer irreparable harm each day that their grant funds are \ninaccessible. See, e.g., Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 7-10, 16 (detailing additional irreparable harms suffered \nsince March 21).  \nPut simply, the equities weigh against a stay because this is a quintessential scenario where, \neven if Plaintiffs were to win on their claims, without access to funds during the pendency of this \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 6 of 11\nlitigation, they would still lose due to the dramatic impact that sustained loss of funding would \nhave on their operations.  That is precisely the type of harm that any preliminary injunction entered \nby this Court would be intended to remedy. \nD.  A Stay Is Contrary To The Public Interest \nFinally, for all the reasons a preliminary injunction allowing Plaintiffs to access funds \nwould further the public interest, a stay would be contrary to the public interest.  See Dkt. 33-1 at \n55-56; Dkt. 53 at 25.  The repercussions of Plaintiffs’ inability to access their funds reverberate \nwell beyond Plaintiffs and their subgrantees.  The public has an acute interest in the billions of \ndollars of investments that Congress authorized in the Inflation Reduction Act, which were \nawarded to Plaintiffs in line with that interest—for example, so they could advance projects related \nto solar power, electric vehicles, energy-efficient affordable housing, and low-emissions heating \nand cooling systems for families across the country. \nIII.  There Is No Basis To Stay Any Preliminary Injunction Against Citibank \nThe Court should also deny the stay because the Government’s sole argument supporting \nits stay motion—namely, that there is supposedly no federal jurisdiction over claims against the \nGovernment—cannot justify staying a preliminary injunction against Citibank, a private party that \nholds the funds subject to independent contractual obligations that Citibank violated. \nFirst, although Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction against Citibank as well as the \nGovernment, the Government has not—and may not—seek to stay any order entered against \nCitibank.  Citibank is a separate defendant in this lawsuit, and is fully able to move for a stay \nshould it believe one is warranted.  Citibank has not done so.  The Government’s sole interest is a \ncontingent security interest, and it has never sought to issue a Notice of Exclusive Control (nor \ncould it).  The Government should not be permitted to litigate the interests of a third party that can \nspeak for itself.  Cf. Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 700-01 (1979) (“[T]he usual rule [is] that \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 7 of 11\nlitigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.”). \nSecond, even if the Government’s stay motion could be deemed to seek a stay of any \ninjunction against Citibank, there is no justification for doing so.  Citibank is a private party subject \nto contractual obligations, and the Government’s jurisdictional objections do not deprive the Court \nof jurisdiction over Citibank.  To be sure, Citibank has claimed on the basis of derivative sovereign \nimmunity that this case should be stayed in the event this Court concludes that the claims against \nthe Government belong in the Court of Federal Claims.  Citibank is not likely to prevail on that \nargument on appeal for the reasons stated in briefing, and because there is no precedent supporting \nthis position.  \nThird, the Government’s stay motion is deficient because, as explained in preliminary \ninjunction briefing, Citibank executed account control agreements that require Citibank to abide \nby the instructions of accountholders (Plaintiffs and their subgrantees) regardless of the validity of \nEPA’s purported termination of the NCIF grant program, and regardless of whether Plaintiffs can \nsue the Government in this Court.  Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion seeks to require \nCitibank to comply with its contractual obligations under the account control agreements.  Citibank \nis not likely to prevail in any appeal from a preliminary injunction entered against it, given the \nplain terms of the account control agreements, which contain integration clauses.  Moreover, \nalthough Citibank has relied upon the FAA, the FAA simply points back to the ACAs. And \nCitibank has never sought to defend its conduct based on the four corners of those agreements.  \nMoreover, neither Citibank nor the Government has ever cited any contractual basis in the ACAs \npermitting the Government to claw back funds.  There is none.   \nFourth, although Plaintiffs’ briefing demonstrated irreparable injury and that the public \ninterest is in their favor (see also supra), neither Citibank nor the Government has ever explained \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 8 of 11\nwhy  an  injunction  mandating  that  Citibank  comply  with  its  contractual  obligations  to \naccountholders would cause Citibank irreparable injury, or why an injunction against Citibank is \nagainst the public interest.  Citibank’s opposition to the preliminary injunction motion uses the \nword “irreparable” just once, in articulating the standard, and never even discusses the equities.  \nDkt. 48 at 12.  It has therefore waived any argument that requiring it to abide by the contracts it \nsigned is against the public interest or would cause it irreparable harm.  For the same reasons, \nneither the Government nor Citibank can show that a stay of any injunction against Citibank \npending appeal is needed to avoid irreparable injury to Citibank. Nken, 556 U.S. at 433-34; \nCompare Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) (“Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on \na possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an \nextraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled \nto such relief.”). \nIV.  Alternatively, The Court Should Enter A Limited Stay Pending An Expedited \nAppeal \n \nFor the reasons above, no stay is warranted here.  If, however, the Court stays any part of \nits preliminary injunction order, the stay should not apply to any of the following—which would \nimpose no harm on Defendants but would inflict further irreparable injury on Plaintiffs. \nFirst, during the pendency of any appeal, the Plaintiffs’ NCIF funds (as well as those of \ntheir Subgrantees) should remain at Citibank.  If EPA and Citibank are permitted to seize, or \ntransfer funds out of, Plaintiffs’ accounts, this Court may well be powerless to restore the status \nquo ante and grant Plaintiffs complete relief.  This Court has already recognized this irreversible \nharm, noting that “[i]f Citibank transfers money out of these accounts, the funds will not be \nrecoverable.”  Dkt. 28 at 19.  “Any transfer, re-allocation, or re-obligation of these funds would,” \nthe Court held, thus “be an irreparable loss.”  Id.  By contrast, maintaining these funds at Citibank \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 9 of 11\nwould cause no harm to Defendants. \nSecond, any stay this Court might enter should not apply to the disbursement requests by \nPlaintiffs or their subgrantees corresponding to Plaintiffs’ operational expenses (as opposed to the \nloans they intend to offer).  Those disbursement requests are a tiny fraction of the total amount of \nmoney at issue: in Climate United’s case, it is approximately $25 million.  See Bafford Decl. ¶ \n18.     Those disbursements are essential to allowing Plaintiffs to maintain their operations.  As \nMs. Bafford explains on behalf of Climate United, to fully cover operational expenses for the next \nsix months—including payroll for employees, rent, insurance, payments to essential contractors, \nand other necessary expenses—Climate United would need access to at least $25 million in \nfunding for itself and its coalition partner subgrantees.  Id. This would save Climate United and its \npartners from being forced to wind down operations before this case can be litigated to final \njudgment.  Id. Although this amount would not permit Climate United to continue any of its active \nprojects and advance its mission—the very reason for Climate United’s existence and for the NCIF \nfunding—and thus would still force Climate United to suffer irreparable harm, it would at least \nallow Climate United to survive.  Id. \nAt  a  bare  minimum,  a  stay  should  be  denied  with  respect  to  draw  requests  and \ndisbursements related to Plaintiffs’ or their Subgrantees’ operational expenses that were pending \nor incurred as of March 11, 2025.   In Climate United’s case, for example, this amount is \n$6,347,303.87. See Bafford Decl. ¶ 19.  Although that amount would not be sufficient to cover \noperating expenses for the duration of this litigation, it would at least allow Climate United to keep \nthe lights on for approximately 2 months.  Id.  The public interest favors Plaintiffs on these funds \nbecause Plaintiffs are virtually certain to recover these funds anyway even if this case is sent to \nthe Court of Federal Claims.  Id. ¶ 20.  Moreover, whereas the inability to access these funds \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 79     Filed 04/15/25     Page 10 of 11\npending appeal would result in substantial and irreversible harm to Plaintiffs, any potential harm \nto the Government here is negligent or nonexistent. \nThird, any stay this Court might enter should not apply to any disbursement or transfer \ninstruction submitted by Plaintiffs or their Subgrantees prior to EPA’s purported termination of \nthe NCIF awards on March 11, 2025.  Those pre-termination instructions correspond to roughly \n$450 million in NCIF funds owed to Plaintiffs and their Subgrantees—and nearly 75 percent of \nthe $625 million in funds the Government claims it stands to lose if the Court refuses to stay its \nhypothetical order pending appeal.  See Dkt. 16-2; id. Ex. B.; Dkt 75 at 1.  But, as explained, there \nis no dispute that Plaintiffs would be entitled to such disbursements—requested before EPA issued \nthe  March  11  Notices  of  Termination—as  part  of  the  grant  closeout  process  even  if  the \nGovernment’s Tucker Act theory is correct (which it’s not).  Disbursement of these funds therefore \ndoes not harm the Government.  An order staying their disbursement would, however, result in \nfurther irreparable injury to Plaintiffs.

(“Citibank”)  respectfully  submits  this  opposition  to  plaintiff  Climate \nUnited Fund (“Climate United”)’s motion for a temporary restraining order.  Citibank has a \nnarrow and limited role in connection with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”).  \nCitibank  does  not  select  grant  recipients,  determine  compliance  with  grant  agreements,  or \notherwise determine whether funds should or should not be dispersed.  Rather, pursuant to a \nFinancial Agency Agreement (“FAA”) with the Department of the Treasury, Citibank has been \ndesignated as a Financial Agent of the United States to provide commercial banking and finance \nservices.  Ex. 1.  The FAA is the umbrella agreement for Citibank with regard to the GGRF, and \nit establishes an agent-principal relationship between the bank and the government.   \nIn its role as an agent for the United States, Citibank “owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty \nand fair dealing to the United States,” and is required to “act at all times in the best interests of \nthe United States.”  Id. § 5.A.  Citibank also must “comply with all lawful instructions or \ndirections received from Treasury,” id. § 5.B(iv), and it must implement account controls as \ninstructed by the Environmental Protection Agency, id. at Ex. A § I.B.  As required by the FAA, \nCitibank established accounts for, and entered into account control agreements with, the grant \nrecipients  (including  Climate  United).    But  Citibank’s  obligations  in  the  account  control \nagreements are subject to and governed by Citibank’s ongoing obligations to the United States, \nas set forth in the FAA with Treasury.     \nCitibank has been instructed by EPA and the Department of Treasury to pause all further \ndisbursements  from  GGRF  accounts,  including  those  held  by  Climate  United,  until  further \nnotice.  Most recently, EPA directed Citi to “pause the processing of payment instructions for the \nGGRF accounts until further notice,” and stated that it was “critical that the Bank not resume \nprocessing payment instructions for the GGRF accounts.”  Ex. 2 (3/10/2025 EPA Email).  The \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 4 of 16\n \nDepartment of Treasury similarly issued a directive “instructing Citibank, in its capacity as \nfiduciary, to comply with EPA’s instructions.”  Ex. 3 (3/10/2025 Treasury Email).  These \ndirectives followed similar instructions and correspondence from the federal government in \npreceding weeks, wherein (i) the government informed Citibank that the GGRF program was \nsubject  to  an  ongoing  criminal  investigation;  (ii)  the  FBI  recommended  placing  a  30-day \nadministrative freeze on the accounts in light of “credible information” of possible criminal \nviolations; (iii) the EPA Administrator called for the FAA to be terminated and the grant funds to \nimmediately  be  returned;  and  (iv)  the  EPA  Inspector  General  opened  an  investigation.  \nAdditionally, on the evening of March 11, 2025, Citibank learned that EPA was terminating \nClimate United’s grant agreement.  See ECF 13. \nAs the Financial Agent of the United States, Citibank is required to comply with the \ndirectives issued by the EPA and Treasury and pause the processing of payment instructions for \nthe GGRF accounts until further notice.  Because it owes fiduciary duties to the United States, \nCitibank also was and is required to cooperate with the United States as it investigates the \nconcerns  described  above.    Citibank  desires  nothing  more  than  to  fulfill  its  contractual \nobligations.  Citibank will continue those efforts and, of course, will follow any court order. \nThose orders should not, however, include the “extraordinary remedy” of a temporary \nrestraining order against Citibank.  State v. Musk, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 520583, at *2 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (Chutkan, J.).  Climate United is unlikely to succeed on the merits of its \nclaim  against  Citibank,  given  that  Citibank  complied  with  all  contractual  obligations  by \nfollowing lawful instructions from its principal, the United States.  And while the Court need not \naddress other equitable factors given Climate United’s failure to show a likelihood of success, \n   2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 5 of 16\n \nthose factors also favor denying emergency relief, where Citibank has not breached any contract \nand the public interest favors allowing Citibank to continue fulfilling its contractual obligations.     \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \nThis case arises in part out of the Inflation Reduction Act, a statute passed in 2022 that \nprovided “$27 billion to invest in clean energy in communities across the country.”  ECF 1 § 22.  \nCongress did not appropriate these funds in favor of any specific private recipient.  Congress \ninstead provided that the Administrator of the EPA would select “eligible recipients for the \npurposes of providing grants, loans, or other forms of financial assistance, as well as technical \nassistance,  to  enable”  various  communities  “to  deploy  or  benefit  from  zero-emission \ntechnologies,” including “distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and to carry out other \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction activities, as determined appropriate by the Administrator.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1).  Additional provisions provided that grantees should use the funds to \n“provide  financial  assistance  to  qualified  projects  at  the  national,  regional,  state,  and  local \nlevels,” and should “prioritize investment in qualified projects that would otherwise lack access \nto financing.”  Id. § 7434(b).   \nThe statute does not provide Citibank with any policymaking role with respect to the \nGGRF.  Citibank plays no role in deciding who receives GGRF funds, the amount of funds those \nentities  should  receive,  or  whether  grant  recipients  are  in  compliance  with  their  grant \nagreements.  Citibank also has no oversight responsibilities in connection with the GGRF, as \nthose responsibilities are exclusively handled by EPA.       \nB.  Citibank’s Financial Agency Agreement  \nCitibank is instead a financial agent of the United States, and so owes the United States \nfiduciary duties, including a fiduciary duty of loyalty.  On September 18, 2024, Citibank and the \n   3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 6 of 16\n \nDepartment of the Treasury entered into a Financial Agency Agreement (“FAA”), pursuant to \nwhich Citibank would “provide services related to programs under the Inflation Reduction Act of \n2022 . . . including grant programs.”  Ex. 1 (Recitals).  The FAA provides that Citibank \n“acknowledges and agrees that it owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty and fair dealing to the United \nStates when acting as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id. § 5.A.  The FAA further \nprovides that as a financial agent, Citibank will “act at all times in the best interests of the United \nStates when carrying out its responsibilities under this FAA and in all matters connected with \nthis agency relationship.”  Id.   \nThese fiduciary obligations include duties to “construe the terms of this FAA and any \nrelated instructions from Treasury in a reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of \nthe United States,” id. § 5.B.ii, as well as “to act only within the scope of its actual authority and \nto comply with all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury,” id. § 5.B.iv.  All of \nCitibank’s activities under the FAA are also subject to an additional provision providing that, \n“[n]otwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  FAA,  when  Treasury  in  its  sole  discretion \ndetermines that such actions are necessary to protect the interests of the United States, Treasury \nmay reduce the authorized scope of work under this FAA, terminate this FAA, or revoke the \nFinancial Agent’s status as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id. § 23.  The FAA also \nprovides that “Treasury may periodically issue instructions through bulletins, letters, or other \ncommunications, consistent with this FAA,” to “further . . . clarify the scope of the duties and \nservices of the Financial Agent under this FAA.”  Id. § 3.D.   \nThe FAA describes the work Citibank must perform in Exhibit A to the agreement.  See \nid. § 3.A.  That Exhibit provides that Citibank “shall provide commercial banking and finance \nservices”  in  support  of  EPA’s  grant  awards.    Id.  at  Ex.  A  § I.    These  services  include \n   4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 7 of 16\n \n“establish[ing] controlled accounts in the names of the . . . Prime Recipients” of GGRF grants, as \nwell as “establish[ing] controlled accounts in the names of” certain “subrecipients” of GGRF \ngrants.  Id. at Ex. A §§ I.A.1.i, ii.  The FAA specifies that “EPA will be party to account control \nagreements with each of the Prime Recipients and will be the secured party.”  Id. at Ex. A \n§ I.A.1.i.  “The Financial Agent” must also “implement account controls, including as instructed \nby EPA.”  Id. at Ex. A § I.B.  The FAA emphasizes EPA’s role in overseeing the accounts.  It \nprovides that “[t]he Financial Agent shall freeze accounts, and transfer funds in frozen accounts, \nat the direction of the relevant secured party [the EPA, with respect to Prime Recipients], in \naccordance with the account control agreements,” id. at Ex. A § I.B.4, that EPA shall be notified \nin advance of withdrawals above certain limits, see id. at Ex. A § I.B.1, and that EPA must be \npermitted “full account visibility” into each account via a secure online platform, id. at Ex. A \n§ I.D.1.  Other provisions provide that Citibank will perform additional banking services, such as \n“invest[ing] . . . liquidity . . . in [money market funds] backed entirely by U.S. Treasury \nsecurities,” and permitting “daily . . . investor redemptions and draws” from these accounts.  Id. \nat Ex. A § I.C.1.   \nC.  Citibank and Climate United’s Account Control Agreement \nThe FAA contemplates that Citibank will also be party to “account control agreements” \nwith recipients of GGRF grants.  Id. at Ex. A § I.A.1.i.  As relevant here, Citibank entered into \nan account control agreement with Climate United on November 1, 2024.  See Ex. 4.  The \naccount control agreement recognizes and incorporates the FAA, specifying that “the Bank has \nbeen designated and authorized to act as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id. at 1.  The \naccount  control  agreement  provides  that  “[t]he  Bank  shall  comply  with  all  instructions, \nnotifications, and entitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and \nfinancial assets in the Accounts . . . originated by [Climate United],” unless Citibank “receives a \n   5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 16\n \nnotice . . . from the Secured Party that the Secured Party is exercising its right to exclusive \ncontrol over an Account.”  Id. § 2 (discussing a “Notice of Exclusive Control”).  \nThe account control agreement, however, also contains additional provisions relevant to \nthis case.  The agreement provides that Citibank shall not have any duties “fiduciary in nature” \nwith respect to Climate United.  Id. § 6.a.  Citibank is required to take only “administrative or \nministerial” actions with respect to the account.  Id.  The agreement contemplates that the \n“Secured Party” (EPA, as relevant here) may also “submit instructions to the Bank.”  Id. § 13.b.  \nCitibank also shall not be liable for “indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive or special losses \n. . . whether or not any such losses or damages were foreseeable or contemplated.”  Id. § 6.b.  \nAnd the account control agreement also states that Citibank may not be held liable for following \nthe instructions of the United States government, specifying that “[t]he Bank shall not incur any \nliability for not performing any act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of any \noccurrence beyond its control,” “including, without limitation, any provision of any present or \nfuture law or regulation or any act of any governmental authority.”  Id.  \nD.  Citibank’s Compliance With Instructions From The United States \nGovernment. \nClimate United’s lawsuit arises out of Citibank’s compliance with instructions from \nagencies of the United States, including EPA and the Department of Treasury.  On February 17, \n2025,  Citibank  received  written  correspondence  from  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation, \nrequesting  that  Citibank  “[p]lease  accept  this  letter  as  a  recommendation  to  place  an \nadministrative freeze on the account(s) associated with” certain account control agreements, “for \n30 days.”  Ex. 5 (2/17/2025 FBI Ltrs.) at 1.  Climate United’s account was listed as one of the \nimpacted accounts.  See id. at 2.  FBI requested this action on account of “credible information \nreceived by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the above account(s) ha[d] been involved in \n   6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 16\n \npossible criminal violations, including 18 § U.S.C. 371 (Conspiracy to defraud the United States) \nand 18 § U.S.C. 1343 (Wire fraud).”  Id.  Citibank complied with the FBI’s requests, while also \nconferring with the DOJ and EPA regarding the basis for their concerns.1  As the Government’s \ninvestigations developed, Citibank continued to confer with DOJ, EPA, and Treasury regarding \nthe GGRF accounts. \nOn March 4, 2025, the Department of Treasury directed Citibank not to disburse funds \nfrom any of the GGRF accounts for a specified period.  Specifically, the Department of Treasury \nstated that it had been informed of EPA’s “concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of \ninterest related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” and that “EPA anticipates developing \nadditional account controls.”  Ex. 7 (3/4/2025 Treasury Email).  The email further provided: \nTreasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as fiduciary, to work directly with \nthe EPA to establish and implement reasonable account controls to serve the \npurposes and interests of the United States, in accordance with Section 5 of the \nFAA.  Further, in order to provide the EPA with the necessary time to develop \nreasonable account controls, we are further instructing Citibank not to disburse \nfunds from any of the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, March \n9, 2025.   \n \nId. (emphasis added).   \nEarly in the morning of March 10, 2025, EPA and the Department of Treasury directed \nCitibank to continue to refrain from processing payments.  EPA stated that “To prevent the \nmisuse of funds . . . EPA instructs the Bank, pursuant to this Treasury directive, the grant \n \n1 Citibank also learned that EPA’s Inspector General had begun an investigation into the GGRF \nprogram.  Specifically, on March 2, 2025, EPA provided Citibank with a written letter from \nEPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator to EPA’s Office of Inspector General.  The letter stated that \nthe Acting Deputy Administrator was “referring to your office urgent and deeply concerning \nmatters of financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF).”  Ex. 6 (3/2/2025 Inspector General Ltr.) at 2.  The \nletter stated that “[g]iven the severity of the alleged misconduct, waste, conflicts of interest, and \npotential fraud within the GGRF Program, the Administrator is conducting a comprehensive \nreview,” and requested the Inspector General’s “assistance with a comprehensive review of this \narrangement and the issues involved.”  Id. \n   7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 10 of 16\n \nagreements, and Section I.B of Exhibit A to the Financial Agency Agreement (FAA) between the \nBank and Treasury dated September 19, 2024, to pause the processing of payment instructions \nfor the GGRF accounts until further notice.”  Ex. 2 (emphasis added).  The Department of \nTreasury similarly stated that, “[i]n accordance with Treasury’s authorities under the FAA, \nTreasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as fiduciary, to comply with EPA’s instructions \nto Citibank pursuant to the FAA.”  Ex. 3 (emphasis added). \nE.  EPA’s Termination of Climate United’s Grant \nOn the evening of March 11, 2025, Citibank learned that the EPA had terminated Climate \nUnited’s GRRF grant.  See ECF 13.  The Notice and its attached exhibit (a letter from EPA to \nClimate  United)  explained  that  “[f]ollowing  a  comprehensive  review  and  consistent  with \nmultiple ongoing independent federal investigations into programmatic fraud, waste, abuse, and \nconflicts of interest . . . EPA has determined that these deficiencies pose an unacceptable risk to \nthe efficient and lawful execution of this grant,” and that EPA “is terminating Grant Agreement \nNo. 84094001 . . . effective immediately.”  ECF 13-1 at 1.   \nF.  Procedural History \nClimate United filed this suit on Saturday, March 8, naming not only EPA and the EPA \nAdministrator but also Citibank as defendants.  See ECF 1.  On March 9, 2025, Climate United \nfiled an emergency motion seeking a temporary restraining order, asking that Citibank “be \nrestrained  from  refusing  to  comply  with  Climate  United’s  disbursement  requests  under  the \n[account control agreement],” including with respect to both “already-submitted requests” and \n“future requests.”  ECF 2-1 at 35.  Climate United brings three claims against Citibank (breach \nof contract, replevin, and conversion), see ECF 1 ¶¶ 73–98, but does not rely on the replevin or \nconversion claim in support of its motion for a TRO, see ECF 2-1 at 22 & n.20 (disclaiming \n   8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 11 of 16\n \nrelying on these claims).  For purposes of this motion, Climate United instead relies only on its \nbreach of contract claim, alleging a breach of its account control agreement with Citibank.  Id.  \nAs to the EPA defendants, Climate United brings claims for purported “Violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act,” as well as “Violation of the Due Process Clause.”  ECF 1 ¶¶ 99–\n113.  Climate United seeks a temporary restraining order “restrain[ing] [EPA] from impeding \nCitibank from complying with its obligations under this TRO, and from unlawfully suspending \nor terminating Climate United’s grant.”  ECF 2-1 at 35.   \nARGUMENT \n“A temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Musk, 2025 \nWL 520583, at *2 (quotations omitted); D.A.M. v. Barr, 486 F. Supp. 3d 404, 411 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(temporary restraining orders are “extraordinary . . .  and should be granted sparingly”).  The \n“standard for issuance . . . is very high,” C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F.Supp.3d 174, 197 (D.D.C. 2020), \nand requires that the moving party “establish ‘(1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) \nthat he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest,’” Musk, \n2025 WL 520583, at *2 (quoting Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014)).   \nClimate United does not meet the high standard required to merit a temporary restraining \norder against Citibank.  Climate United is not likely to succeed on the merits against Citibank, \nbecause Citibank has lawfully followed instructions received from the United States Government \nunder its Financial Agency Agreement and therefore has fully complied with its contractual \nobligations to Treasury, EPA, and Climate United.  Nor do equitable factors favor an injunction, \nwhere there has been no contractual breach.   \n   9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 12 of 16\n \nI.  PLAINTIFF  IS  NOT  LIKELY  TO  SUCCEED  ON  THE  MERITS  AGAINST \nCITIBANK. \n“In order to receive a TRO or a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show . . . a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Church v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 133 \n(D.D.C. 2021) (quotations omitted), with the result that “failure to show a likelihood of success \non the merits alone is sufficient to defeat a motion for a TRO,” Petty v. Am. Fed. Of Gov’t \nEmployees, 2021 WL 5991734, at *8 (D.D.C. Dec. 17, 2021).  Climate United has not shown a \nlikelihood of success on its breach-of-contract claim:  Because Citibank faithfully followed \ninstructions from Treasury and EPA, as it was required to do under binding contracts, Climate \nUnited’s breach-of-contract claim necessarily will fail. \nClimate United focuses its motion on only its account control agreement with Citibank, \nsee  ECF  2-1  at  21–22,  but  ignores  the  terms  of  Citibank’s  FAA  with  Treasury,  which  is \nreferenced in that account control agreement and which governs Citibank’s duties as an agent of \nthe United States.  See Ex. 2 at 1.  Indeed, the entire premise of the account control agreement is \nCitibank’s role as a “financial agent of the United States” “[p]ursuant to the authority of the \nSecretary of the Treasury under 12 U.S.C. §§ 90 and 265.”  Ex. 1 at 1.  Those statutes require \nthat Citibank “perform all such reasonable duties, as depositaries of public money and financial \nagents of the Government as may be required of [Citibank].”  12 U.S.C. § 265.  And the FAA in \nturn requires that Citibank comply with EPA’s and the Department of the Treasury’s directives, \nincluding directives to pause distributions from GGRF accounts.  Citibank is required, among \nother things, to “comply with all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.”  Ex. 1 \n§ 5.B.iv.  Citibank is also required to “implement account controls, including as instructed by \nEPA,” id. at Ex. A § I.B, which, as relevant here, include EPA’s instructions to implement \ninterim controls pausing GGRF distributions.  More broadly, Citibank also owes fiduciary duties \n   10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 13 of 16\n \nto the United States, including duties to “act at all times in the best interests of the United States” \nand “in a reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of the United States.”  Id. §§ 5.A, \n5.B.ii.  And Treasury retains the right “in its sole discretion” to “reduce [Citibank’s] authorized \nscope of work” when doing so is “necessary to protect the interests of the United States.”  Id. § \n23.   \nThese duties and rights, together with EPA and the Department of Treasury’s express \ninstructions, have obligated Citibank to cooperate with these and other federal agencies in their \ninvestigations of the GGRF program, and have likewise required that Citibank comply with all \nlawful pause orders issued by EPA and the Department of Treasury.   \nClimate United errs to the extent it reads provisions in the account control agreement in \nisolation, without considering the account control agreement’s reference to Citibank’s role as a \nfinancial agent of the United States under the FAA.  Climate United argues that the account \ncontrol agreement requires Citibank to disburse funds “unless EPA has given notice that it \nintends to exercise exclusive control over the account.”  ECF 2-1 at 22.  But Section 2 of the \naccount control agreement (which references the Notice of Exclusive Control) does not address \nwhether  Citibank  should  disburse  funds  on  an  immediate  basis  even  where,  as  here,  the \ngovernment has required an interim pause in distributions in light of ongoing investigations and \nthe establishment of reasonable account controls.  Indeed, implementing such a pause is fully \nconsistent with Citibank’s obligation to comply with Treasury’s directives, implement account \ncontrols requested by the EPA, and otherwise act “in the best interests of the United States.”  Ex. \n1 § 5.A.  And in any event, the account control agreement makes clear in Section 6 that Citibank \ncannot be held liable for following the instructions of the government: “[t]he Bank shall not \nincur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of \n   11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 14 of 16\n \nany  occurrence  beyond  its  control  (including,  without  limitation  .  .  .  any  governmental \nauthority[)].”  Ex. 4 § 6.b.  These provisions weigh heavily against whatever likelihood of \nsuccess Climate United could otherwise show against Citibank, particularly where nothing in the \naccount control agreement otherwise contractually obligates Citibank to ignore its fiduciary \nduties to the United States under the FAA.   \nClimate United’s assertion that the account control agreement “does not provide Citibank \nwith . . . discretion” also does not support a TRO.  ECF 2-1 at 22.  True, the account control \nagreement characterizes Citibank’s role as “ministerial” and “administrative.”  Ex. 4 § 6.a.  But \nthat only underscores why liability against Citibank is unlikely:  the account control agreement \ndoes not envision thrusting Citibank into a discretionary or decision-making role with respect to \nwhat level of fraud is necessary to pause disbursements from GGRF accounts.  Citibank is not \nvested with discretion to second-guess the government’s concerns regarding the “misconduct, \nwaste, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud” that the government has stated is occurring.  Ex. \n6 at 4.    \nII.  EQUITABLE FACTORS DO NOT FAVOR EMERGENCY RELIEF AGAINST \nCITIBANK. \nEquitable concerns also disfavor emergency relief against Citibank.  The court “need not \nlinger” on the “the balance of the equities and public interest” where parties do not demonstrate a \nlikelihood of success.  George v. George Washington Univ., 2022 WL 1719002, at *8 (D.D.C. \nMay 27, 2022); Petty, 2021 WL 5991734, at *9.  There is also “a well-recognized public interest \nin enforcing contracts and upholding the rule of law,” with the result that temporary injunctions \nshould be denied where they would not “hold[] the parties to their contractual obligations.”  \nWickapogue 1 LLC v. Blue Castle (Cayman) Ltd., 657 F.Supp.3d 234, 243 (E.D.N.Y. 2023).   \n   12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 14     Filed 03/12/25     Page 15 of 16\n \nEquitable factors and the public interest do not favor emergency relief against Citibank \nhere,  where  Citibank  is  upholding  its  contractual  obligations  under  the  FAA  and  has  not \nbreached the account control agreement.  Citibank has, instead, only done its best to serve its \ncustomers while following instructions from the government of the United States, to whom \nCitibank owes a duty of loyalty and at whose direction Citibank is contractually obligated to act.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should deny Climate United’s motion for a temporary restraining order.   \n \nDated:  March 12, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nBy:   /s/ K.

Congress tasked EPA with standing up a program to award and distribute $27 billion \nin grants, by far the largest program EPA has ever administered, and indeed a multiple of EPA’s \nown annual budget.  Congress also gave EPA a hard deadline of September 30, 2024, to obligate \nthe entirety of those funds. 42 U.S.C. § 7434.  \nFollowing the presidential transition, EPA learned a series of troubling facts about how \ncertain large program grants had been allocated and structured.  Instead of holding the funds itself \nand disbursing reimbursements following review of invoices and evaluation of work performed, \nEPA chose to use an external financial agent, Citibank, to hold the $20 billion appropriated for the \nEPA’s Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) and National Clean Investment Fund \n(NICF) programs for distribution to grant recipients.  The selection of grant recipients also raised \na host of concerns.  The initial grant award terms were then modified in December 2024 and again \non January 13, 2025—i.e., after the presidential election but before the transition. \nAccordingly, the new Administration began to undertake a review the grants, and the post-\nelection amendments and actions on the grants, specifically investigating whether the program as \ncurrently  structured  provides  EPA  with  adequate  controls  to  ensure  grant  funds  are  used \nappropriately.  A criminal investigation was also launched to evaluate the process that led to these \ngrants and the grant modifications.  In view of these investigations, on March 4, EPA asked the \nDepartment of Treasury (as the contracting party with Citibank) to instruct Citibank to pause \ndistributions while it continued to evaluate the presence of adequate control mechanisms.  EPA \nlater extended the pause.  Ultimately, EPA concluded that Plaintiff’s grant should be terminated, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 8 of 27\n     \n \nalong with seven other grants like it, sending notices of termination on March 11.  Among the \nreasons described in the notice, EPA explained that the existing grants lacked adequate controls \nand should be re-awarded under new agreements that ensure the EPA retains adequate oversight.  \nEPA’s termination moots the claims in Plaintiff’s Complaint and its motion for temporary \nrestraining order (the TRO Motion).  The Complaint prays for relief that EPA be enjoined from \nsuspending or terminating the grant “except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant \naward and applicable law.”  And the TRO Motion asks the Court for an order forcing Citibank and \nEPA to disburse funds under the relevant contracts, on the theory that the grant remains live.  But \nthe temporary pause in distributions has been overtaken by the termination of the grant in accord \nwith its terms and the agency’s authority.  On termination, the grant agreement itself precludes \nClimate United from withdrawing additional money.  The grant agreement then describes the relief \nClimate United may seek upon termination.  As Judge Ali concluded in an opinion filed earlier this \nweek, AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. U.S. Dep’t of State, Civ. No. 25-00400 (AHA), 2025 U.S. \nDist. LEXIS 42875, at *42 (D.D.C. March 10, 2025), challenging a freeze on grant distributions \ndoes not give the Court authority to adjudicate termination of those grants.  Here, the agreement \nhas been terminated, and Plaintiff itself has acknowledged EPA’s right to do just that.  Plaintiff’s \nclaims are moot, and Plaintiff must now look to its grant agreement for available relief.  \nThat relief—and, for that matter, the now-moot relief Plaintiff seeks in its TRO Motion—\nmust be asserted under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. 1491(a)(1), which bars jurisdiction in this court. \nAlthough the intersection between the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tucker Act \ncan be hazy, this case lies squarely within the well-established confines of Tucker Act jurisdiction. \nTermination is explicitly governed by the grant agreement, and regulations are incorporated into \nthat agreement.  Plaintiff may pursue its remedies under the agreement and ultimately seek judicial \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 9 of 27\n     \n \nreview and damages in the Court of Federal Claims.  But Plaintiff may not ask this Court to force \nEPA to undo its termination.  Congress has not waived the United States’ sovereign immunity to \nallow courts to compel the government to specifically perform agreements.  \nSetting all of that aside, even under the APA’s standard of review, EPA’s decision to suspend \n(and then terminate) was anything but arbitrary and capricious.  It was instead a reasonable choice \nto ensure greater oversight over billions of dollars in taxpayer money.  And EPA has announced \nthat it intends to redeploy that money consistent with Congress’s authorization.  As to the due \nprocess claim, Plaintiff may utilize the process it bargained for—that is, judicial review of EPA’s \ntermination in the Court of Federal Claims.  The law requires no additional process. \nIn all events, temporary injunctive relief is unavailable because the harm Plaintiff alleges \nis classically monetary.  Nor would an injunction serve the public interest.  The relevant program \nis just beginning—the grant agreement was signed in August 2024, and its terms were modified as \nrecently as January 16, 2025.  The injunction Plaintiff seeks would harm the public interest by \nmaking billions of dollars immediately available to Climate United when the EPA has concluded \nthat the existing regime provides inadequate oversight and controls.   \nFor these reasons, and as further explained below, the TRO motion should be denied. \nFACTUAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nOn August 16, 2022, Congress amended the Clean Air Act to create the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction Fund (GGRF): a $27 billion infrastructure investment to establish “green banks.”  Green \nbanks are “relatively new types of financial institutions” designed to funnel funding to climate \nrelated infrastructure and technology investments.  Cong. Rsch. Serv. IN12090, EPA’s Greenhouse \nGas Reduction Fund at 2, https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12090.  The GGRF is \ncomprised of three grant programs—the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 10 of 27\n     \n \nCommunities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All (SFA).  The Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) oversees the program’s administration.   \nIn July 2023, EPA published Notices of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) and began accepting \nand reviewing applications soon thereafter.  EPA announced selectees and funding amounts on \nApril 2, 2024.  Climate United Fund (Climate United) was awarded a $6.97 billion dollar grant \nfrom the NCIF program, the largest grant amongst the selectees.  \nOn August 8, 2024, EPA and Climate United entered into a grant agreement (Grant \nAgreement), via a Notice of Award, which included the grant’s terms and conditions.  Declaration \nat Exhibit A (Grant Agreement).  The Grant Agreement was amended on December 20, 2024, and \nagain just days before the end of the prior administration, on January 16, 2025.  Declaration at \nExhibit A.   \nThe Grant Agreement incorporates various provisions of the Uniform Grant Guidance, \nincluding 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339, 340 and 341.  These regulations describe the procedures EPA must \nfollow if it terminates the Grant Agreement.  See 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339, 341.   \nRather than funding grant distributions directly through the United States Treasury, the \nGrant Agreement was unusual in that it allowed the government to use a designated financial agent \nas  the  depository  institution  to  administer  program  distributions.    Grant Agreement  at  51.  \nDefendant Citibank serves that role. Declaration at B (ACA).   \nTreasury, Climate United, and EPA then entered an Account Control Agreement (ACA) on \nNovember 1, 2024.  That agreement, too, was amended just days before the transition of leadership \nin the Executive Branch, on January 16, 2025.  The ACA provides, in relevant part, that EPA \npossesses a security interest in the Citibank accounts that contain the program funds.  ACA at 2.  \nThe amendments appear to reduce EPA’s oversight.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 11 of 27\n     \n \nUpon assuming office, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin began to learn more about this program \nand to express concerns with the GGRF program’s creation and implementation.  See Press \nRelease, EPA, Administrator Zeldin Announces that Billions of Dollars Worth of “Gold Bars” \nHave  Been  Located  at  Outside  Financial  Institution  (February  13,  2025), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-announces-billions-dollars-worth-gold-\nbars-have-been-located.  EPA sent its Office of Inspector General a letter on March 2, 2025, \ndetailing the concerns with the GGRF program, including allegations of “misconduct, waste, \nconflicts of interest, and potential fraud” and noting pending investigations by the FBI and DOJ.  \nSee Declaration at Exhibit C.   \nOn March 4, 2025, Treasury—understanding that EPA anticipated “developing additional \naccount controls, including issuing a series of oversight questions to recipients, consistent with \nprudent operational standards and EPA’s authority under grant agreement documents and Section \nI.B of Exhibit A to the Financial Agency Agreement (FAA)”—instructed Citibank “not to disburse \nfunds from any of the GGRF accounts” prior to the end of the day Sunday, March 9, 2025.  \nDeclaration at Exhibit D.  As part of its due diligence, EPA also sent a communication to the eight \nGGRF primary grant recipients requesting the awardees submit responses, along with documents, \nto various inquiries about the GGRF program.  Declaration at Exhibit D.   \nOn March 6, 2025, Citibank wrote to EPA noting that the bank “awaits further guidance … \non the additional account controls and direction” EPA intended to pursue.  Declaration at Exhibit \nE.  EPA responded on March 8 and informed Citibank that given “structural challenges, the current \nlack of critical information, ongoing investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and Federal \nBureau of Investigation, and ongoing reviews by other federal oversight entities, it is time-critical \nand essential that [the parties] work together to develop and implement necessary safeguards” to \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 12 of 27\n     \n \n“serve the purposes and interests of the United States.”  Declaration at Exhibit F.  On March 9, \nEPA instructed Citibank “to pause the processing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts \nuntil further notice.”  Declaration at Exhibit G.  Treasury also instructed Citibank to comply with \nEPA’s instructions to Citibank pursuant to the FAA.  Declaration at Exhibit H. \nOn March 11, EPA issued a notice terminating Climate United’s Grant Agreement under \nthe GGRF program.  Declaration at Exhibit I (Termination Letter).  In the letter, EPA explained \nthat “termination is based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, \nprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which \ncollectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”  Id.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY \nOn March 8, Plaintiff filed its Complaint, followed by a Motion for Temporary Restraining \nOrder (TRO) on March 10.  EPA now opposes the TRO motion pursuant to the deadlines set by \nthis Court’s March 10 order.  March 10 Minute Order, 1:25-cv-698-TSC.  \nSTANDARDS OF DECISION \nI.  The TRO Standard \n \n“The standard for issuance of the ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ of a temporary \nrestraining order or a preliminary injunction is very high, and by now very well established.”  \nC.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 197 (D.D.C. 2020).  A movant seeking such an extraordinary \nremedy “bears the burden of making a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such relief.”  Id.  To \nmake such a showing, Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing (1) it is likely to “succeed on the \nmerits,” (2) it is “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,” (3) “the \nbalance of the equities tips in [its] favor,” and (4) “an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id.   \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 13 of 27\n     \n \nII.  The APA Standard \nThe scope of review under the “arbitrary and capricious” standard, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), \nis “narrow and a court is not to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.”  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  This standard “deems the agency \naction presumptively valid provided the action meets a minimum rationality standard.”  Sierra \nClub v. EPA, 353 F.3d 976, 978 (D.C. Cir. 2004). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The TRO Motion is Moot \n \nPlaintiff’s request for TRO is now moot and must be denied.  EPA terminated the Grant on \nMarch 11, 2025, ending Plaintiff’s performance and its right to request disbursement of funds.  So \nthe TRO, which sought to lift a temporary suspension of those disbursements while the grant was \nstill live, has been overtaken by events.   \n“A case becomes moot―and therefore no longer a ‘Case’ or ‘Controversy’ for purposes of \nArticle III―when the issues presented are no longer live or the parties lack a legally cognizable \ninterest in the outcome.”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 (2013).  “No matter how \nvehemently the parties continue to dispute the lawfulness of the conduct that precipitated the \nlawsuit, the case is moot if the dispute is no longer embedded in any actual controversy about the \nplaintiffs’ particular legal rights.”  Id.  “The rule in federal cases is that an actual controversy must \nbe extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.”  Preiser v. Newkirk, \n422 U.S. 395, 401 (1975).  “An intervening event will render a claim moot if it becomes impossible \nfor the court to grant the prevailing party effective relief.”  Westberg v. F.D.I.C., 759 F. Supp. 2d \n38, 43-45 (D.D.C. 2011); see also People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v. Gittens, 396 \nF.3d 416, 421 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“An appeal from an order granting a preliminary injunction \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 14 of 27\n     \n \nbecomes  moot  when,  because  of  the  defendant’s  compliance  or  some  other  change  in \ncircumstances, nothing remains to be enjoined through a permanent injunction.”); Burlington N. \nR.R. Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 75 F.3d 685, 688 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (a case is moot when \n“intervening events make it impossible to grant the prevailing party effective relief” against the \noriginally challenged policy). \nPlaintiff brought this motion to challenge Citibank’s alleged noncompliance with the ACA \nand to “restrain EPA from impeding Citibank from complying with the ACA.”  Motion at 4, 35.  \nBut the landscape has changed.  Upon termination of the grant, Citibank is no longer bound by the \nACA to disburse grant funds to Plaintiff—indeed, it is no longer permitted to do so.  The TRO is \nthus moot: Plaintiff is no longer able to make disbursement requests, Citibank can no longer \ncomply with such requests, and, thus, there is no potential compliance that may be impeded. \nInstead, the Grant Agreement itself now prohibits the relief Climate United seeks. To withdraw \nfunds, Climate United must certify “that the amount of the payment is necessary to execute against \nthe workplan in effect . . .”  Grant Agreement at pp. 56.  With no workplan in place, Plaintiff cannot \nmake that certification.    \nJudge Ali’s recent decision, in AIDS Vaccine, which addressed a similar legal issue on \ndistinguishable facts, is instructive.  In that case, the Court had enjoined the agency’s freeze of \nthousands of USAID grants.  AIDS Vaccine, 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 42875 at *37.  The agency \nthereafter initiated large scale terminations of the grants.  Id.  The court concluded that the decision \nto freeze was a separate agency action from the later terminations and thus could not be challenged \nas part of the same case.  See id.  The same is true here. To the extent the motion (and complaint) \ndescribes “agency action,” it describes EPA’s pause on disbursements.  But now, any injury stems \nfrom EPA’s termination of the grant.  Even if EPA’s termination could be challenged as an agency \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 15 of 27\n     \n \naction (which, as explained below, it cannot, and has not been), it would be a “distinct ... agency \naction that must be challenged as such.”  Id. at *42.  \nII.  Plaintiffs Are Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n \nPutting aside that the present claims are now moot, Plaintiff cannot secure injunctive \nrelief because it cannot demonstrate that it is likely to succeed on the merits.  Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009).  Plaintiff’s claims have their source of right in a grant and seek to \naccess grant funds—and so this really amounts to a breach-of-contract suit that is not subject to \nreview in this Court.  And even if jurisdiction existed, EPA’s suspension (and now termination) \nof grant funding was not “arbitrary or capricious” but rather was reasonable and in compliance \nwith EPA’s rights under the Grant Agreement and its inherent authority to protect the public fisc. \nIt therefore violates neither the APA nor the Due Process Clause. \nA.   This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiff’s APA and Due Process Claims  \n \nEven if Plaintiff’s claims were still viable, the relief Plaintiff seeks is entirely contractual \nin nature and therefore not properly before the Court.  See Compl. at 34.  Though obscured by \nreferences to the APA, Plaintiff asks for monetary relief—disbursement of grant funds pursuant to \na grant agreement with EPA, and based on a supposed violation of the terms of that contractual \nagreement.  Jurisdiction over these contract-based claims cannot lie here.  \n1.  The Tucker Act provides in relevant part that “[t]he United States Court of Federal \nClaims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States \nfounded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  \nCourts routinely treat federal grants as contracts, when they have the classic elements of an offer, \nan acceptance, and consideration.  See Bennett v. New Jersey, 470 U.S. 632, 638 (1985) (“Title I, \nlike many other federal grant programs, was ‘much in the nature of a contract.’”) (quoting \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 16 of 27\n     \n \nPennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981)); Henke v. U.S. Dep’t of \nCommerce, 83 F.3d 1445, 1450 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“An NSF grant agreement includes the essential \nelements of a contract and establishes what would commonly be regarded as a contractual \nrelationship between the government and the grantee.”); Thermalon Indus., Ltd. v. United States, \n34 Fed. Cl. 411, 415 (1995) (“Viewing the grant terms and conditions in their entirety, the court \nconcludes that the parties intended to be bound contractually.”).  Indeed, Plaintiff itself repeatedly \nrefers to the “contract” throughout its Complaint.  See Compl. at 3, 4, 28, and 34. \nThe D.C. Circuit has “interpreted the Tucker Act as providing the exclusive remedy for \ncontract claims against the government, at least vis a vis the APA.”  Shaffer v. Veneman, 325 F.3d \n370, 373 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (emphasis added) (quoting Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Office of Thrift \nSupervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992)); see also Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 \nF.3d 591, 618-19 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (explaining that D.C. Circuit has “interpreted the Tucker Act … \nto ‘impliedly forbid[]’ contract claims against the Government from being brought in district court \nunder the [sovereign immunity] waiver in the APA”) \nRegardless of how a claim is styled, a district court lacks jurisdiction if the claim “is in ‘its \nessence’ contractual.”  Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 619 (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d \n959, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); see also Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits, 357 F.3d 62, 67 (D.C. \nCir. 2004) (“[T]he district court lacks jurisdiction if [plaintiff’s claim] is essentially a contract \naction.”). “[E]ven for claims that are not for money damages, the APA confers no ‘authority to \ngrant relief if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief \nwhich is sought.’” Albrecht 357 F.3d at 67  (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  Though the D.C. Circuit has \n“rejected the ‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring some reference to or incorporation of a \ncontract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly within the Tucker Act,’” it has also \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 17 of 27\n     \n \nwarned that plaintiffs cannot avoid the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional consequences by crafting a \ncomplaint to disguise what is essentially a contract claim as a claim for equitable relief under a \nseparate legal authority.  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 \n(D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, Bd. for Corr. of Mil. Recs., 56 F.3d 279, 284 \n(D.C. Cir. 1995); Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969-70 (“This court retains the power to make rational \ndistinctions between actions sounding genuinely in contract and those based on truly independent \nlegal grounds.”).  In determining whether a claim “is ‘at its essence’ contractual” the D.C. Circuit \nmakes determinations based on “both on the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its \nclaims, and upon the type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).   \nApplying the two-prong test described in Crowley here, Plaintiff’s arbitrary-and-capricious \nclaim is essentially a contract claim for monetary relief against EPA that this Court lacks subject-\nmatter jurisdiction to resolve.  See Albrecht, 357 F.3d at 68 (“[T]he district court lacks jurisdiction \nif [the plaintiff’s claim] is essentially a contract action.”). \nFirst, under Crowley’s “source of rights” prong, Plaintiff’s claims are clearly contractual.  \nIn examining the “source of the rights” prong, the D.C. Circuit considers whether “the plaintiff’s \nasserted  rights  and  the  government’s  purported  authority  arise  from  statute”;  whether  “the \nplaintiff’s rights ‘exist[] prior to and apart from rights created under the contract”; and whether \n“the plaintiff ‘seek[s] to enforce any duty imposed upon’ the government ‘by the … relevant \ncontracts to which’ the government ‘is a party.’”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.  Here, Plaintiff’s rights \nto GGRF funding arise solely from its contract with EPA—the Grant Agreement.  No statute or \nregulation entitles Plaintiff to participate or receive funding from the GGRF program, and Plaintiff \nseeks to enforce the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement against EPA.  Similarly, EPA’s \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 18 of 27\n     \n \nauthority to terminate the grant arises from the Grant Agreement and the regulations incorporated \ninto the contract’s terms and conditions.  \nSecond¸ under Crowley’s “type of relief sought” prong, Plaintiff’s requested relief also \npoints to the contractual nature of their claims.  Climate United seeks to withdraw money that it \ncontends it has a right to access under its grant with EPA.  That is an explicitly contractual remedy.  \nSee Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 619.  As the D.C. Circuit has recently explained, “the crux of” this \nrelief-focused inquiry “boils down to” whether the plaintiff, “in whole or in part, … explicitly or \n‘in essence’ seeks more than $10,000 in monetary relief from the federal government.”  Crowley, \n38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284).  Plaintiffs here seek payment of billions of \ndollars in grant funding.  While Plaintiff does not explicitly demand monetary relief from EPA in \nits Complaint or TRO Motion, “[t]he plain language of a complaint . . . does not necessarily settle \nthe question of Tucker Act jurisdiction.”  Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284.  In asking the Court to enjoin \nEPA “from impeding Citibank from complying with its contractual obligations” “or unlawfully \nsuspending or terminating Climate United’s grant award,” Compl. at 34-35, Plaintiff is effectively \nseeking “an order compelling the government to pay [it] money,” Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. U.S., \n764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985), pursuant to the only legal instrument that would entitle them \nto any program funding at all—i.e., the Grant Agreement.  Such relief is indistinguishable from \n“the classic contractual remedy of specific performance,” id., and, as a result, confirms that \nPlaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim “sound[s] in contract,” Perry Capital, 864 F.3d at 619.  \nSee id. (observing that “specific performance is an explicitly contractual remedy”); Albrecht, 357 \nF.3d at 69 (concluding that the plaintiff’s claim “sound[ed] in contract” in part because the terms \nof  the  contract  at  issue  “w[ould]  determine  whether  the  relief  sought—recovery  of  past \ncontributions and termination of future payments—[was] available”); Transohio Sav. Bank, 967 \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 19 of 27\n     \n \nF.2d at 613 (recognizing the D.C. Circuit’s “very specific holdings that the APA does not waive \nsovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific relief”). \nThis is not merely a technical distinction.  It bears directly on the remedies that Plaintiff \nmay seek.  In particular, specific performance does not lie against the government, United States \nv. Jones, 131 U.S. 1 (1889), and “[f]ederal courts do not have the power to order specific \nperformance by the United States of its alleged contractual obligations,” Coggeshall Dev. Corp. v. \nDiamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989) (citing Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 \nU.S. 670, 689 (1982); see also Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 701–02 \n(1949); Doe v. Civiletti, 635 F.2d 88, 89 (2d Cir. 1980); Chemung Cnty. v. Dole, 781 F.2d 963, 970 \n(2d Cir. 1986). The Court therefore cannot undo EPA’s termination of the grant or force it to \nreinstate the grant agreement and specifically perform the grant.  See Coggeshall, 884 F.2d at 3 \n(“We are unaware of any waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States as to specific \nperformance for breach of contract.”); Identification Devices, Inc. v. United States, 121 F.2d 895 \n(D.C. Cir. 1941) (denying injunctive relief); Clay v. United States, 210 F.2d 686 (D.C. Cir. 1953) \n(action to void assignment of patents to United States).  \nIn sum, “despite [Plaintiff’s] valiant effort to frame the suit as one for declaratory or \ninjunctive relief, this kind of litigation should be understood for what it is”—“a suit for money for \nwhich the Court of Federal Claims can provide an adequate remedy, and it therefore belongs in \nthat court.”  Suburban Mortg. Assocs. v. U.S. Dept. of Housing and Urban Dev. 480 F.3d 1116, \n1118 (Fed. Cir. 2007).  \n2.  Plaintiff’s due process claim is also contractual in nature and does not belong in \nthis court.  See Olympic Fed. Sav. And Loan Ass’n v. Dir., Office of Thrift Supervision., CIV. A. \nNo. 90-0482, 1990 WL 134841, at *8-9 (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 1990) (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 20 of 27\n     \n \n967).  The due process claim is nothing more than an attempt to enforce its rights under the Grant \n“through an alternative legal vehicle.”  Id. at *8.  “Where the focus of the complaint is on an \nalleged breach of contract ... a plaintiff cannot avoid the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional and remedial \nrestrictions by recasting its claim as a constitutional due process claim.”  Id. at *9.  Inclusion of an \nallegation that EPA deprived the Plaintiff of due process is not enough to establish jurisdiction.  \nSee Am. Sci. & Eng’g, Inc. v. Califano, 571 F.2d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 1978) (declining to exercise federal \nquestion jurisdiction where aim of suit was to enforce agreements or receive money damages).    \nThis dispute does not arise on “independent legal grounds” outside the grant.  See Ingersoll-\nRand Co. v. U.S., 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969-70).  \nDespite Plaintiff’s efforts to re-package its grant claim into due process claims against EPA, “this \ndispute [is] entirely contained with the terms of [the Grant].”  Id.  The claim that EPA violated due \nprocess “by refusing performance under [the Grant] is substantively indistinguishable from a \nbreach of contract claim.”  Suburban Mortg. Assocs., 480 F.3d at 1128.  Indeed, the TRO Motion \npoints to the Grant Agreement as governing, including “specific requirements with which EPA \nmust comply to terminate or suspend” the Grant.  TRO Motion at 9-11; see also id. at 11-14 \n(outlining the rights and obligations of the parties under ACA).  In fact, the TRO Motion’s \nconclusion demonstrates why this is  a contract case: Plaintiff seeks to enforce its rights to money \nunder the ACA and to prevent EPA from suspending the grant. \nB.   Even If Jurisdiction Were Proper Here, EPA’s Actions are Not Arbitrary or \nCapricious \nThe APA’s “arbitrary and capricious” standard, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), “is deferential and \nnarrow in scope.”  Husky Mktg. & Supply Co. v. FERC, 105 F.4th 418, 421 (D.C. Cir. 2024); see \nalso Sissel v. Wormuth, 77 F.4th 941, 947 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (“[O]rdinary arbitrary-and-capricious \nreview is highly deferential and presumes the validity of agency action.” (cleaned up)).  As a result, \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 21 of 27\n     \n \na court reviewing agency action under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard “may not substitute \nits own judgment for that of the agency.”  Columbia Gulf Transmission v. FERC, 106 F.4th 1220, \n1230 (D.C. Cir. 2024).  Instead, the court must “simply ensure[] that the agency has acted within \na zone of reasonableness,” and an agency decision must be upheld so long as it is “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  An agency \ndecision is set aside only if “there has been a clear error of judgement” “based on a consideration \nof the relevant factors.”  Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971). \nEPA’s suspension of Plaintiff’s grant (and, to the extent that it is before the Court, the \ntermination of that grant) was eminently reasonable—not arbitrary or capricious.  When an agency \nobserves highly unusual features and late-breaking modifications to a grant, and when its Office \nof Inspector General along with the FBI and DOJ are accordingly investigating and conducting \ndue diligence, it should be obvious that the only responsible course in the interim is to suspend \nfurther grant disbursements that might otherwise be unrecoverable.  Likewise, EPA’s decision to \nterminate the grant—based on “substantial concerns regarding program integrity, objections to the \naward process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s \npriorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the \naward,” Declaration at Exhibit I—plainly falls well within “a zone of reasonableness,” Prometheus \nRadio Project, 592 U.S. at 423.   \nIn short, EPA permissibly determined that various deficiencies in the GGRF program \n“pose[d] an unacceptable risk to the efficient and lawful execution of [the GGRF] grant that cannot \nbe remedied by imposing specific conditions, necessitating immediate termination to safeguard \ntaxpayer funds and ensure compliance with federal assistance regulations.”  Declaration at Exhibit \nI.   Insofar as any APA review applies, this Court should defer to EPA’s judgment.  And, again, \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 22 of 27\n     \n \ninsofar as Plaintiff wishes to pursue contract-based claims asserting breach of grant terms, it is free \nto do that—but not in this forum or through these causes of action.  \nC.   The Temporary Hold on the Citibank Accounts Was Not Final Agency Action \nWhile EPA’s termination of the grant moots any basis for seeking relief associated with \nEPA’s instructions to Citibank to pause payment of money to Climate United and other grantees, \nEPA’s directive to Citibank was not a final agency action, and therefore it is not reviewable under \nthe APA for this additional reason. \nThe APA  makes  reviewable  only  final  agency  action,  as  opposed  to  “preliminary, \nprocedural,  or  intermediate”  agency  actions.    5  U.S.C.  §  704.    “Often  the  agency’s  own \ncharacterization of a particular order provides some indication of the nature of the announcement,” \nPacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. FPC, 506 F.2d 33, 39 & n. 20, (D.C.Cir.1974), but the judiciary has \nalso developed a test for finality.  In part, an action is final only if it marks “the consummation of \nthe agency’s decisionmaking process.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997).  A decision \nreflects the “consummation” of the agency decisionmaking process when that decision is subject \nto no further agency review.  Sackett v. E.P.A., 566 U.S. 120, 127 (2012).  Here the temporary \npause placed on the Citibank accounts was a precautionary measure to ensure that funds were not \ntransferred or disbursed as EPA conducted a responsible and comprehensive review of the $20 \nbillion program.  Declaration at E.  EPA remained free to lift the pause at any time.  The temporary \nhold on the Citibank account was thus not reviewable under the APA.    \nIII.  Plaintiff’s Alleged Harm Cannot Justify a TRO  \nPlaintiff’s request for a temporary restraining order should be denied for the additional, \nindependent reason that its claimed harms are purely monetary and therefore are not irreparable.   \nAs Plaintiff acknowledges, Climate United is an entity created and operated solely for the \npurpose of applying for and spending the NCIF grant.  See ECF No. 2-2, Bafford Dec. ¶¶ 5, 40; \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 23 of 27\n     \n \nsee also id. ¶ 41 (acknowledging that its purpose is to fund projects that the market does not want \nto fund).  The D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). “Where the injuries alleged are \npurely financial or economic, the barrier to proving irreparable injury is higher still, for it is ‘well \nsettled that economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.’” Mexichem Spec. \nResins, Inc. v. E.P.A., 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 \nF.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). “The Supreme Court has echoed this message, finding that ‘the \ntemporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable \ninjury.’”  Id. (citing Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974)).  Important here, Plaintiff must \nprove “not just that [it] faces an irreparable harm, but that the injunction would clearly avoid this \ninjury.”  Santini v. Farris, No. 2:21-cv-13045, 2022 WL 831420, at *3 (E.D. Mich. Feb. 15, 2022), \nreport and recommendation adopted, No. 21-13045, 2022 WL 831224 (E.D. Mich. Mar. 18, 2022) \n(citing Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)). \nAs explained above, upon termination Climate United must look to the Grant Agreement \nfor relief.  Any judicial review is then limited to claims for monetary contract damages.  See supra, \nPart II.  The financial harms to Climate United caused by termination are therefore not irreparable. \n“The rule that equitable remedies cannot issue when the damages are monetary in nature has been \ningrained in law for ‘half a millennium or so,’ and no judge within the English common law \ntradition has the luxury of ignoring it.” United States v. Michigan, 230 F.R.D. 492, 495 n.1 (E.D. \nMich. 2005). This is true even where a movant claims that waiting for money is harmful because \nof a lack of other funds.  See id. (“[Movant] argues that its ratepayers are low-income and do not \nhave the luxury of saying, ‘It’s only money.’”). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 24 of 27\n     \n \nFurther, much of the harm alleged in the motion is out of date.  Plaintiff’s claimed need to \npay for committed sources of funding, programs it has launched, and programs it intends to launch, \nBafford Dec. ¶¶ 46-50, are superseded by termination.  So are Plaintiff’s concerns with the “impact \non internal operations,” Bafford Dec. ¶¶ 43-45, and its need to design, conduct outreach about, or \ndeploy additional programs that it would have funded with the now-terminated grant, Bafford Dec. \n¶ 49.  “Since injunctive relief is intended to prevent future irreparable harm, where, as here, the \nharm to the moving party has already occurred, such relief is inappropriate.”  T & L Redemption \nCtr. Corp. v. Phoenix Beverages, Inc., 752 F. Supp. 64, 67 (E.D.N.Y. 1989) (declining to enter \npreliminary injunction where harms could not be avoided because plaintiff was already effectively \nout of business); see also United States v. Bolton, 468 F. Supp. 3d 1, 6 (D.D.C. 2020) (ruling that \npreliminary injunction would not prevent irreparable harm from publication of classified materials \nwhere publication had already occurred).  Once again, Plaintiff’s remedy, if any, now lies in the \nCourt of Federal Claims under the terms of its contracts—not in this Court, and certainly not in \nthe extraordinary relief of a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order. \nIV.  An Injunction Would Be Contrary to the Public Interest.  \nLastly, the balance of equities and public interest weigh against the extraordinary remedy \nof a preliminary injunction. “Where the federal government is the opposing party, the balance of \nequities and public interest factors merge.” Harris v. Bessent, --- F. Supp. 3d ---- (D.D.C. 2025) \n(citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 435).   \nAs explained above, Plaintiff has failed to clearly show that it will face “great, certain, \n[and] imminent” harm absent such relief.  Navajo Nation v. Azar, 292 F. Supp. 3d 508, 513 \n(D.D.C. 2018).  Meanwhile, any injunction allowing immediate the grantees to access billions of \ndollars in grant funds would be contrary to the public interest.  In light of EPA’s “comprehensive \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 25 of 27\n     \n \nreview” of the grant and a determination that it has “substantial concerns regarding program \nintegrity,” “programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse,” and “the absence of adequate oversight and \naccount controls to prevent financial mismanagement,” any relief that would reopen Climate \nUnited’s access to grant funds would severely compromise EPA’s protection of the public fisc—\namong its most important duties to the public.  Moreover, any relief purporting to reverse grant \ntermination and force EPA to specifically perform, in addition to being legally unavailable, \nwould compromise EPA’s ability to ensure that the grant funds are eventually re-obligated to a \nqualified applicant after addressing the agency’s concerns with inadequate account controls.  The \nCourt should not interfere with that core exercise of Article II executive authority, consistent \nwith Congress’s delegation.  \nThere is significant risk that potentially billions in grant funds disbursed to Climate \nUnited based on a temporary injunction will not be recovered should Climate United later be \nrequired to repay them under the terms of the grant.  Climate United was formed specifically to \nseek an award under the GGRF and is not otherwise capitalized.  See Compl. at 9 ¶ 33.  At \nminimum, to ensure that the government’s interests are fully protected, any relief the Court \norders must be accompanied by a security sufficient to “pay the costs and damages sustained by \nany party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 65(c). \nAt bottom, “the protection of the public fisc is a matter that is of interest to every \ncitizen.”  Brock v. Pierce Cnty., 476 U.S. 253, 262 (1986).  “Numerous cases, accordingly, have \nrecognized a public interest in determining whether government programs dispensing taxpayer \nmoney involve fraud, waste, or abuse.”  WP Co. v. U.S. Small Bus. Admin., 502 F. Supp. 3d 1, 23 \n(D.D.C. 2020).  Here, EPA has significant concerns of inadequate control over Climate United’s \nuse of funds—and for good reason.  The public interest is not served by forcing the government \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 26 of 27\n     \n \nto undo its termination and allowing plaintiff free rein to continue disbursing funds despite the \nEPA’s termination of its grant—much less doing so in this extraordinarily expedited posture.  A \ndispute over $20 billion in grant funding should not be effectively adjudicated in three business \ndays. \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiff’s TRO motion as moot, or in \nthe alternative, for lack of subject matter jurisdiction to award injunctive relief, for lack of any \nlikelihood of success on the merits, for lack of any irreparable harm, or because the public interest \nfavors denying the TRO. \n   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 16     Filed 03/12/25     Page 27 of 27\n     \n \nDated: March 12, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nYAAKOV ROTH  \nActing Assistant Attorney General  \n \nKIRK T.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-00698     Document 2     Filed 03/10/25     Page 1 of 6\n \nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \nCLIMATE UNITED FUND   \n7550 Wisconsin Avenue 8th Floor   \nBethesda, Maryland 20814   \n  ECF CASE \nPlaintiff,   \n  No. 1:25-cv-00698 \nv.   \n   \nCITIBANK, N.A.,   \n5800 South Corporate Place \nSioux Falls, South Dakota 57108, \n \nand  \n \nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL \nPROTECTION AGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460, \n \nand  \n \nLEE ZELDIN, in his official capacity as \nADMINISTRATOR, UNITED STATES \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \nAGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460 \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nCLIMATE UNITED’S MOTION FOR TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n \n  Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), Plaintiff Climate United Fund (“Climate United”) \nhereby moves for a temporary restraining order requiring Defendant Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) \nto comply with its contractual obligations under the Account Control Agreement, including by \ndisbursing National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) grant funds to which Climate United is legally \nentitled, both with respect to requests that Climate United has already submitted and future \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698     Document 2     Filed 03/10/25     Page 2 of 6\n \nrequests, until the Court can further consider the merits.  Because statements by both Citibank and \nthe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Administrator strongly suggest that EPA is causing \nCitibank’s illegal actions, Climate United also seeks a temporary restraining order enjoining EPA \nand EPA Administrator Zeldin from impeding Citibank from complying with its contractual \nobligations, or otherwise causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise prevent Climate \nUnited from accessing its grant funds as provided for under the Account Control Agreement, the \ngrant award, and applicable law. Climate United also seeks a temporary restraining order enjoining \nEPA and EPA Administrator Zeldin from unlawfully suspending or terminating Climate United’s \ngrant award, except as is permitted in accordance with the Account Control Agreement, the grant \naward, and applicable law.   \n  As set forth in more detail in the accompanying Memorandum of Law, Climate United has \na strong likelihood of success on its claims against Citibank for breach of contract. Climate United \nalso has a strong likelihood of success on its claims that EPA’s actions are arbitrary and capricious, \nan abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure \nAct, and that EPA’s actions violate Climate United’s right to due process. Defendants’ conduct \nthreatens Climate United with imminent irreparable injury. That injury outweighs any benefit \ngained by Defendants. The public interest is best served by requiring Citibank and EPA to comply \nwith the Account Control Agreement, the grant award, and applicable law. \n  Pursuant to Local Civil Rule 65.1(a), on March 8, 2025, Counsel for Climate United \nemailed Defendants or their representatives to provide a copy of the complaint filed on March 8, \n2025, and to provide notice that they would be filing a motion for a temporary restraining order \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698     Document 2     Filed 03/10/25     Page 3 of 6\n \non March 10, 2025, with respect to Climate United’s NCIF grant.1  Contemporaneously with filing \nthis Motion for Temporary Restraining Order, Counsel for Climate United emailed Defendants or \ntheir representatives the motion and accompanying brief, declaration, exhibits and proposed order \nat the following email addresses: \nK.

(“Citibank”) respectfully submits this response to plaintiffs’ consolidated \nmotion for a preliminary injunction.  Citibank has a narrow and limited role in connection with the \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”) and the National Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”), \nthe programs through which plaintiffs received grants.  Citibank does not select grant recipients, \ndetermine compliance with grant agreements, or otherwise determine whether funds should or \nshould not be disbursed.  Rather, pursuant to a Financial Agency Agreement (“FAA”) with the \nDepartment of Treasury, Citibank has been designated as a Financial Agent of the United States \nto provide commercial banking and finance services.  CUF ECF 15-1.  The FAA serves as the \numbrella agreement guiding Citibank’s role with regard to the GGRF, and provides, among other \nthings, that Citibank “owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty and fair dealing to the United States,” must \n“act at all times in the best interests of the United States,” and must “comply with all lawful \ninstructions or directions received from Treasury.”  Id. §§ 5.A, 5.B.  \nCitibank submits this response to clarify Citibank’s role and actions and to make clear that \nCitibank has not breached any contract.  Citibank is, as the Court has acknowledged, “in the middle \nof all of this.”  3/12/2025 Hr’g Tr. at 28:14-15.  Citibank has at all times followed what it \nunderstands  as  its  contractual  obligations  to  account  holders  and  contractual  and  fiduciary \nobligations to the government.  Citibank will continue those efforts and, of course, will comply \nwith any court order.  \nPlaintiffs’ suggestion that Citibank has breached the account control agreements errs \nbecause it fails to read those agreements “in harmony” with the FAA, the umbrella agreement upon \nwhich the account control agreements are based.  Ritch v. N.Y. Eye & Ear Infirmary, 2023 WL \n6393970, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 29, 2023).  The FAA and the account control agreements “must \nbe read together,” as they are both designed to “effectuate the same purpose” of the GGRF \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 25\n \nprogram.  Matek Inc. v. Int’l Bus. Machines Corp., 2024 WL 663340, at *2-3 n.3 (D.D.C. Feb. 16, \n2024).  And given that the FAA must inform any interpretation of the account control agreements, \nparticularly as to Citibank’s role, Citibank cannot have been in breach:  the FAA requires Citibank \nto act at the government’s direction, and follow the government’s “directives” is all Plaintiffs assert \nCitibank has done here.  CUF ECF 33-1 at 4.  \nFinally, Citibank addresses below the proper procedure that should govern if the Court \nwere to determine that it lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims against the government.  In the \nevent the government has sovereign immunity against claims for specific performance of a contract \nand this case is sent to the Court of Federal Claims, then Citibank will be due “derivative sovereign \nimmunity” as well.  See Part II, infra.  And there would also be little reason to continue litigation \nin this Court while the gravamen of the litigation—plaintiffs’ claims against the government—\nproceed in a different forum.  In the event claims against the government are dismissed, for lack \nof jurisdiction or otherwise, then claims against Citibank should be dismissed or stayed as well.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \nThis case arises in part out of the Inflation Reduction Act, a statute passed in 2022 that \nprovided “$27 billion to invest in clean energy in communities across the count[r]y.”  CUF ECF 1 \n§ 22.1  Congress did not appropriate these funds in favor of any specific private recipient.  \nCongress instead provided that the Administrator of the EPA would select “eligible recipients for \nthe purposes of providing grants, loans, or other forms of financial assistance, as well as technical \n \n1 “CUF ECF” refers to the docket in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., et al., No. 1:25-cv-\n698 (D.D.C.); “PFC ECF” refers to the docket in Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank, \nN.A., et al., No. 1:25-cv-762 (D.D.C.); and “CGC ECF” refers to the docket in Coalition for Green \nCapital v. Citibank, N.A., et al., No. 1:25-cv-735 (D.D.C.). \n   2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 25\n \nassistance,  to  enable”  various  communities  “to  deploy  or  benefit  from  zero-emission \ntechnologies,” including “distributed technologies on residential rooftops, and to carry out other \ngreenhouse gas emission reduction activities, as determined appropriate by the Administrator.”  42 \nU.S.C.  § 7434(a)(1).    The  Greenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund  includes  the  “National  Clean \nInvestment Fund,” which is established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(2).  See CUF ECF 15-1 \nat Ex. A § I (describing the program).  The plaintiffs in this litigation are grantees receiving funds \nunder the NCIF program.     \nThe statue does not mention Citibank, let alone provide Citibank with policymaking \nauthority with respect to the GGRF.  Citibank plays no role in deciding who receives GGRF funds, \nthe amount of funds those entities should receive, or whether grant recipients are in compliance \nwith their grant agreements.  Citibank also has no oversight responsibilities in connection with the \nGGRF.  Those responsibilities are exclusively handled by EPA.   \nB.  Citibank and Treasury’s Financial Agency Agreement \nCitibank is a “Financial Agent” of the United States in connection with the NCIF program, \nand so owes the United States fiduciary duties, including a fiduciary duty of loyalty.  On September \n18, 2024, Citibank and the Department of Treasury entered into a Financial Agency Agreement \n(“FAA”), pursuant to which Citibank would “provide services related to programs under the \nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 . . . including the grant programs.”  CUF ECF 15-1 (Recitals).  \nThe FAA provides that Citibank “acknowledges and agrees that it owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty \nand fair dealing to the United States when acting as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id. \n§ 5.A.  The FAA further provides that as a financial agent, Citibank will “act at all times in the \nbest interests of the United States when carrying out its responsibilities under this FAA and in all \nmatters connected with this agency relationship.”  Id.   \n   3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 25\n \nThese fiduciary obligations include duties to “construe the terms of this FAA and any \nrelated instructions from Treasury in a reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of \nthe United States,” id. § 5.B.ii, as well as “to act only within the scope of its actual authority and \nto  comply  with  all  lawful  instructions  or  directions  received  from  Treasury,”  id.  §  5.B.iv.  \nCitibank’s activities under the FAA are also subject to an additional provision providing that, \n“[n]otwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  FAA,  when  Treasury  in  its  sole  discretion \ndetermines that such actions are necessary to protect the interests of the United States, Treasury \nmay reduce the authorized scope of work under this FAA, terminate this FAA, or revoke the \nFinancial Agent’s status as a financial agent of the United States.”  Id. § 23.  The FAA also provides \nthat  “Treasury  may  periodically  issue  instructions  through  bulletins,  letters,  or  other \ncommunications, consistent with this FAA,” to “further . . . clarify the scope of the duties and \nservices of the Financial Agent under this FAA.”  Id. § 3.D. \nAlthough plaintiffs focus on different contracts—the “account control agreements” or \n“ACAs” governing their respective accounts—those agreements are also established pursuant to \nthe FAA.  The FAA describes the work Citibank must perform in Exhibit A.  The Exhibit provides \nthat Citibank “shall establish controlled accounts in the names of the [National Clean Investment \nFund] … grant recipients,” who are defined as “Prime Recipients,” and shall “be party to account \ncontrol agreements with each of the[se] Prime Recipients.”  Id. at Ex. A § I.A.1.i.  The Exhibit \nalso provides that the FAA—and not just the account control agreements—governs Citibank’s \nconduct with respect to grantees:  “Each Prime Recipient and Subrecipient account holder will \nhave the ability to access and use funds in their respective accounts in accordance with, and subject \nto, the terms and conditions of each Prime Recipient’s or Subrecipient’s Grant Program grant \nagreement and the conditions and restrictions detailed in this Exhibit A [to the FAA].”  Id. at Ex. \n   4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 9 of 25\n \nA § I.A.1.iv.  And the account control agreements themselves similarly reflect that they are not \nindependent of the FAA.  Each account control agreement contains “Whereas” clauses, which \nrecognize that the FAA is the premise for Citibank’s role in the grant program and that Citibank is \nan agent of the United States government.  Specifically, the account control agreements each \nrecognize that “[Citibank] has been designated and authorized to act as a financial agent of the \nUnited States pursuant to the authority of the U.S. Department of Treasury under 12 U.S.C. §§ 90 \nand 265.”  See CUF ECF 14-4 at 1.   \nThe FAA also contains additional provisions emphasizing EPA and the government’s role \nin overseeing grantees’ accounts.  The FAA specifies that “EPA will be party to account control \nagreements with each of the Prime Recipients and will be the secured party.”  CUF ECF 15-1 at \nEx. A § I.A.1.i. “The Financial Agent” must also “implement account controls, including as \ninstructed by EPA.”  Id. at Ex. A § I.B. The FAA emphasizes EPA’s role in overseeing the \naccounts.  It provides that “[t]he Financial Agent shall freeze accounts, and transfer funds in frozen \naccounts, at the direction of the relevant secured party [the EPA, with respect to Prime Recipients], \nin accordance with the account control agreements,” id. at Ex. A § I.B.4, that EPA shall be notified \nin advance of withdrawals above certain limits, see id. at Ex. A § I.B.1, and that EPA must be \npermitted “full account visibility” into each account via a secure online platform, id. at Ex. A \n§ I.D.1.   \nThe FAA also provides that the government may even remove Citibank as a financial agent \nif necessary to protect the government’s interests:  “Notwithstanding any other provision of this \nFAA, when Treasury in its sole discretion determines that such actions are necessary to protect the \ninterests of the United States, Treasury may reduce the authorized scope of work under this FAA, \n   5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 10 of 25\n \nterminate this FAA, or revoke the Financial Agent’s status as a financial agent of the United \nStates.”  Id. § 23.   \nC.  The Account Control Agreements \nAs required by the FAA, Citibank has entered into the required account control agreements \nwith plaintiffs.  Each plaintiff is a Prime Recipient of the GGRF, and each of their account control \nagreements incorporates similar terms.  The account control agreements each reference the FAA, \nspecifying (as noted above) that “the Bank has been designated and authorized to act as a financial \nagent of the United States.”  CUF ECF 14-4 at 1.  The agreements also provide that “[t]he Bank \nshall comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement orders the Bank receives directing \nthe disposition of funds and financial assets in the Accounts . . . originated by [CGC],” unless \nCitibank “receives a notice . . . from the Secured Party [the EPA] that the Secured Party is \nexercising its right to exclusive control over an Account.”  Id. § 2 (discussing a “Notice of \nExclusive Control”). \nThe account control agreements also, however, contain additional provisions limiting \nCitibank’s duties and making clear that Citibank is also required to follow directions from the \ngovernment.  The agreements contemplates that the “Secured Party” (EPA, as relevant here) may \nalso “submit instructions to the Bank.”  Id. § 13.b.  Citibank also shall not be liable for “indirect, \nincidental, consequential, punitive or special losses . . . whether or not any such losses or damages \nwere foreseeable or contemplated.”  Id. § 6.b.  And the account control agreements also state that \nCitibank may not be held liable for following the instructions of the United States government, \nspecifying that “[t]he Bank shall not incur any liability for not performing any act or fulfilling any \nobligation  hereunder  by  reason  of  any  occurrence  beyond  its  control,”  “including,  without \nlimitation, any provision of any present or future law or regulation or any act of any governmental \nauthority.”  Id. \n   6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 11 of 25\n \nD.  Citibank’s Compliance With Instructions From The United States \nGovernment \nPlaintiffs’ lawsuits arise out of Citibank’s attempts to fulfill its fiduciary duties and comply \nwith  instructions  from  agencies  of  the  United  States  government,  including  EPA  and  the \nDepartment of Treasury.  On February 17, 2025, Citibank received written correspondence from \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation, requesting that Citibank “[p]lease accept this letter as a \nrecommendation to place an administrative freeze on the account(s) associated with” certain \nACAs, “for 30 days.”  CUF ECF 14-5 at 1 (2/17/2025 FBI Ltrs.).  Plaintiffs’ accounts were listed \nas three of the impacted accounts.  See id. at 2.  FBI requested this action on account of “credible \ninformation received by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that the[se] . . . account(s) ha[d] been \ninvolved in possible criminal violations, including 18 § U.S.C. 371 (Conspiracy to defraud the \nUnited States) and 18 § U.S.C. 1343 (Wire fraud).”  Id.  Pursuant to its fiduciary duties to the \nUnited States, Citibank complied with the FBI’s requests, while also conferring with the DOJ and \nEPA regarding the basis for their concerns.2  As the Government’s investigations developed, \nCitibank continued to confer with DOJ, EPA, and Treasury regarding the GGRF accounts. \nOn March 4, 2025, the Department of Treasury directed Citibank not to disburse funds \nfrom any of the GGRF accounts for five additional days.  Specifically, the Department of Treasury \nstated that it had been informed of EPA’s “concerns regarding potential fraud and/or conflicts of \n \n2  Citibank also learned that EPA’s Inspector General had begun an investigation into the GGRF \nprogram.  Specifically, on March 2, 2025, EPA provided Citibank with a written letter from EPA’s \nActing Deputy Administrator to EPA’s Office of Inspector General.  The letter stated that the \nActing Deputy Administrator was “referring to your office urgent and deeply concerning matters \nof financial mismanagement, conflicts of interest, and oversight failures within the Greenhouse \nGas Reduction Fund (GGRF).”  CUF ECF 14-6 at 2 (3/2/2025 Inspector General Ltr.).  The letter \nstated that “[g]iven the severity of the alleged misconduct, waste, conflicts of interest, and potential \nfraud within the GGRF Program, the Administrator is conducting a comprehensive review,” and \nrequested the Inspector General’s “assistance with a comprehensive review of this arrangement \nand the issues involved.”  Id. at 2, 5. \n   7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 12 of 25\n \ninterest related to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,” and that “EPA anticipates developing \nadditional account controls.”  CUF ECF 14-7 (3/4/2025 Treasury Email).  The email cited \nCitibank’s fiduciary obligations and was explicit in instructing Citibank to not disburse funds:  \nTreasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as fiduciary, to work directly with \nthe EPA to establish and implement reasonable account controls to serve the \npurposes and interests of the United States, in accordance with Section 5 of the \nFAA.  Further, in order to provide the EPA with the necessary time to develop \nreasonable account controls, we are further instructing Citibank not to disburse \nfunds from any of the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, March \n9, 2025.   \n \nId. (emphasis added).   \nEarly in the morning of March 10, 2025, EPA and the Department of Treasury each \ndirected Citibank to continue to refrain from processing disbursement requests, again invoking \nCitibank’s fiduciary duties.  EPA wrote: “To prevent the misuse of funds . . . EPA instructs the \nBank, pursuant to this Treasury directive, the grant agreements, and Section I.B of Exhibit A to \nthe  Financial  Agency  Agreement  (FAA)  between  the  Bank  and  Treasury  …  to  pause  the \nprocessing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice.”  CUF ECF 14-\n2 (emphasis added).  The Department of Treasury similarly stated that, “[i]n accordance with \nTreasury’s authorities under the FAA, Treasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as fiduciary, \nto comply with EPA’s instructions to Citibank pursuant to the FAA.”  CUF ECF 14-3 (emphasis \nadded). \nE.  EPA’s Termination of Plaintiffs’ Grants \nOn the evening of March 11, 2025, Citibank learned that the EPA had terminated plaintiffs’ \nGGRF grants.  See CUF ECF 13.  The Notice and its attached exhibit (a letter from EPA to Climate \nUnited, one of the consolidated plaintiffs here) explained that “[f]ollowing a comprehensive \nreview and consistent with multiple ongoing independent federal investigations into programmatic \nfraud, waste, abuse, and conflicts of interest . . . EPA has determined that these deficiencies pose \n   8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 13 of 25\n \nan unacceptable risk to the efficient and lawful execution of this grant,” and that EPA “is \nterminating Grant Agreement No. 84094001 . . . effective immediately.”  CUF ECF 13-1 at 1.   \nF.  Procedural History \nOn March 8, 2025, plaintiff Climate United filed suit in this District, naming not only EPA \nand the EPA Administrator but also Citibank as Defendants.  On March 10, plaintiff Coalition for \nGreen Capital, another Prime recipient, sued only Citibank in the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York.  See Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, N.A., No. 1:25-cv-\n1964 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No. 1.  On March 12, Coalition for Green Capital filed a Notice of \nVoluntary Dismissal in the New York action, id. ECF No. 9, and refiled in this Court, this time \nadding EPA, the EPA Administrator, and the Acting Deputy EPA Administrator as defendants \nalong with Citibank, see CGC ECF 1.  On March 14, a third Prime recipient, plaintiff Power \nForward Communities, Inc. (“Power Forward”), filed a complaint in this Court against Citibank \nand the Government Defendants.  See PFC ECF 1.3   \nClimate United, the first (and at the time only) plaintiff, moved for a temporary restraining \norder on March 9, 2025.  Climate United requested that Citibank “be restrained from refusing to \ncomply with Climate United’s disbursement requests under the ACA,” including with respect to \nboth “already-submitted requests” and “future requests.”  CUF ECF 2-1 at 35.  During a March \n12, 2025 hearing, the Court acknowledged that “Citibank . . . is in the middle of all this,” noting \nthat “you see the position this puts Citibank in, which has the money, but has been told by EPA \nnot -- that it would be impermissible to distribute the funds.”  3/12/2025 Hr’g Tr. at 7:12-15, 28:14-\n \n3 PFC previously had sued just Citibank in the Southern District of New York.  See Power Forward \nCommunities, Inc. v. Citibank, N.A., No. 1:25-cv-2021 (S.D.N.Y.), ECF No 1.  But, like CGC, \nPFC voluntarily dismissed that suit several days later.  Id. ECF No. 7. \n   9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 14 of 25\n \n15.  The Court directed Climate United and the government defendants to make additional \nsubmissions on Monday, March 17, 2025.  \nOn the evening of Friday, March 14, plaintiff Coalition for Green Capital filed its own \nmotion for a temporary restraining order against Citibank and the government defendants.  See \nCGC ECF 9-1.  Coalition for Green Capital asked for an order enjoining Citibank from disbursing \nfunds from its Citibank accounts to anyone besides Coalition for Green Capital.  See id. at 3.  \nCoalition for Green Capital did not, however, ask that Citibank be required to begin releasing grant \nfunds during the pendency of litigation.  A few hours later, plaintiff Power Forward also sought a \ntemporary restraining order.  Unlike Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward asked that \nCitibank be required to affirmatively “disburse funds” in accordance with Power Forward’s past \nand future transfer instructions.  PFC ECF 4 at 2-3; PFC ECF 4-1 at 6, 31.   \nThis Court held a second hearing to address the various TRO motions on March 17, 2015.  \nSee CUF ECF 27.  Later that afternoon, Climate United filed an Amended Complaint against \nCitibank, the EPA, and the EPA Administrator.  See CUF ECF 24.  The complaint asserted new \nclaims against the Government Defendants challenging the government’s Notice of Termination \nas violative of the APA, federal regulations, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the Appropriations \nClause, see id. ¶¶ 118-59, but did not bring new claims against Citibank.  \nOn March 18, 2025, this Court granted in part and denied in part Plaintiffs’ TRO motions.  \nSee CUF ECF 29 (Order); CUF ECF 28 (Memorandum Opinion).  The Court enjoined Citibank \n“from moving or transferring Plaintiffs’ grant funds to any party other than the accountholders” \nand enjoined the Government Defendants from implementing or giving effect to the Notices of \nTermination they had issued to the Plaintiffs.  CUF ECF 29.  The order, however, was “more \nlimited in scope than Plaintiffs’ proposed orders.”  CUF ECF 28 at 3.  Although Climate United \n   10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 15 of 25\n \nand Power Forward had each sought to require Citibank to disburse funds during the litigation, see \nCUF ECF 2; PFC ECF 4, the Court denied their TRO motions in part, and instead “merely \norder[ed] the parties to preserve the status quo—that is, for Citibank to maintain the grant funds in \nPlaintiffs’ respective accounts.”  CUF ECF 28 at 22.  \nOn March 20, Citibank filed a status report confirming that it “is complying with this \nCourt’s directives in its March 18 [TRO] Order,” and explaining that Citibank “understands those \ndirectives to require it to maintain the grant funds in Plaintiffs’ respective accounts and to not \ntransfer  the  funds  to  the  Government  or  process  Plaintiffs’  pending  or  future  payment \ninstructions.”  CUF ECF 31.  \nG.  Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \nPlaintiffs filed a consolidated motion for a preliminary injunction on March 21, 2025.  The \nmotion seeks an order “enjoining Defendant Citibank from (1) violating its obligations under each \nplaintiff’s ACA, including by failing to process, disburse, and release funds in accounts established \nin connection with each plaintiff’s grant, including funds in accounts established by Plaintiffs’ \nsubgrantees, in accordance with the applicable ACA, both with respect to requests already \nsubmitted and future requests,” as well as “(2) transferring or otherwise moving funds out of \naccounts established in connection with Plaintiffs’ grants, including funds in accounts established \nby Plaintiffs’ subgrantees, except at the direction of Plaintiffs or Plaintiffs’ subgrantees.”  CUF \nECF 33 at 2.   \nPlaintiffs’ memorandum in support of their motion for a preliminary injunction focuses on \ntheir claims against the government, not their claims against Citibank.  Plaintiffs confine their \nargument regarding Citibank to four of sixty pages, see CUF ECF 33-1 at 56-60, and address only \nwhat they assert is Citibank’s purported breach of Citibank’s account control agreements with \nplaintiffs (plaintiffs do not address any of their other replevin, conversion, or tort claims for \n   11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 16 of 25\n \npurposes of this motion).  Because Citibank has not breached its contractual obligations, Citibank’s \nresponse now follows.   \nARGUMENT \nAlthough Citibank defers to the government and otherwise takes no position with respect \nto most factors relating to a preliminary injunction, Citibank notes that preliminary injunctive relief \nis nevertheless “an ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ that is ‘never awarded as of right.’”  Feng \nWang v. Pompeo, 354 F. Supp. 3d 13, 19 (D.D.C. 2018) (Chutkan, J.).  “A preliminary injunction \n‘should not be granted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.’”  \nId. at 20.  “To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were \nnot granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) \nthat the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches \nv. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  Courts must also be “wary” when addressing \nrequests for preliminary injunctive relief that (like demands to require Citibank to disburse funds \nhere) would “disrupt[], rather than preserve[] the status quo.”  Hanson v. District of Columbia, 120 \nF.4th 223, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2024); see also American Civil Liberties Union Found. v. WMATA, 303 \nF. Supp. 3d 11, 17 (D.D.C. 2018) (Chutkan, J.) (“[T]he standard for obtaining an injunction is \nsignificantly heightened when a plaintiff requests affirmative injunctive relief.”).   \nI.  PLAINTIFFS ARE NOT LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS AGAINST \nCITIBANK,  BECAUSE  CITIBANK  HAS  COMPLIED  WITH  ITS \nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.  \n“In order to receive a . . . preliminary injunction, the moving party must show . . . a \nsubstantial likelihood of success on the merits,” Church v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 133 (D.D.C. \n2021) (quotations omitted), with the result that “failure to show a likelihood of success on the \nmerits alone is sufficient to defeat the motion,” Wis. Voters All. v. Pence, 514 F. Supp. 3d 117, 120 \n   12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 17 of 25\n \n(D.D.C. 2021).  Plaintiffs do not show a likelihood of success on the merits with respect to their \nbreach-of-contract  claims  against  Citibank  here.    Citibank  has  carefully  complied  with  its \ncontractual obligations at every turn.  Citibank has provided all required services under its \nagreements, and has refrained from transferring funds to plaintiffs only at the direction of the \nUnited States government, which is Citibank’s fiduciary principal and whose direction Citibank is \ncontractually obligated to follow.   \nA.  The FAA and Account Control Agreements Must Be Read Consistently With \nOne Another.   \nPlaintiffs’  assertion  that  Citibank  has  nevertheless  “breached  [the  account  control \nagreements] by failing to perform” fails to read those agreements in light of the FAA.  CUF ECF \n33-1 at 56.  The account control agreements acknowledge that Citibank’s role is to “act as a \nfinancial agent of the United States.”  CUF ECF 14-4 at 1.  The FAA is the basis for those account \ncontrol agreements: the FAA directs Citibank to “establish controlled accounts” for and enter \n“account control agreements with each of the Prime Recipients.”  CUF ECF 15-1 at Ex. A § I.A.1.i.  \nAnd the FAA also makes clear that Citibank must follow the FAA—and not just the account \ncontrol agreements—when taking actions relating to grantees’ accounts.  In a section titled \n“Relationship  with  Account  Holder,”  the  FAA  provides  that  “Each  Prime  Recipient  and \nSubrecipient account holder will have the ability to access and use funds in their respective \naccounts in accordance with, and subject to, the terms and conditions of each Prime Recipient’s or \nSubrecipient’s Grant Program grant agreement and the conditions and restrictions detailed in this \nExhibit A [to the FAA].”  Id. at Ex. A I.A.1.vi.  (emphasis added).   \nThus, the contracts must be read consistently:  they are “interrelated agreements” that must \nbe “read together . . . ‘in harmony.’”  Ritch, 2023 WL 6393970, at *7.  “Under New York . . . law \ndocuments must be read together, even though they were executed on different dates and were not \n   13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 18 of 25\n \nall between the same parties, if the documents formed part of a single transaction and were \ndesigned to effectuate the same purpose.”  Matek, 2024 WL 663340, at *3 n.3; see Cemex Inc. v. \nDep’t of the Interior, 560 F. Supp. 3d 268, 278 (D.D.C. 2021) (reading contract in “together with \n. . . record of decision and . . . mining plan”); Long Beach Sec. Corp. v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin. \nBd., 315 F. Supp. 3d 129, 134 (D.D.C. 2018) (contract provisions must be interpreted “not in \nisolation but in the light of the obligation as a whole” (quotations omitted)).4  In Matek, for \nexample, each of “two related documents comprise[d] the relevant Agreement”:  both a “Supplier \nRelationship Agreement” and a “Statement of Work” together “govern[ed] the circumstances \nunder which the Agreement may be terminated.”  Matek, 2024 WL 663340, at *3.   \nSo too here.  Plaintiffs’ account control agreements must be read in harmony with the FAA \nupon which those agreements are based.5  Plaintiffs’ assertion that “[t]he fact that Citibank acts as \nan agent of the Government is simply irrelevant,” CUF ECF 33-1 at 58, is remarkably wrong:  that \nfact is instead critical to understanding Citibank’s obligations under both the FAA and the account \ncontrol agreements.  This Court should follow others “when interpreting a contract or multiple \ncontracts in a transaction . . . [in] striv[ing] to give effect to all of the terms of the relevant \ndocuments.”  Kelso Enters. v. A.P. Moller–Maersk A/S, 375 Fed. App’x. 48, 49 (2d Cir. 2010).   \n \n4 The account control agreements are governed by New York law.  CUF ECF 14-4 § 11.   \n \n5 Plaintiffs’ suggestion that the FAA could somehow be only “parol evidence” that is barred by a \n“merger clause” in the account control agreements is meritless.  CUF ECF 33-1 at 57.  Merger \nclauses do not bar consideration of related agreements that “coexist or work in tandem” with the \ncontract containing the merger clause.  Long Side Ventures LLC v. Adarna Energy Corp., 2014 \nWL 4746026, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 24, 2014); see also Crye Precision LLC v. Bennettsville \nPrinting, 2019 WL 6388636, at *6 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2019) (“I find it improvident to treat the \nmerger clause as a blanket extinguishment of prior contractual provisions absent definitive \nlanguage to the contrary.”).   \n   14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 19 of 25\n \nB.  Citibank Complied With Its Contractual Obligations.   \nCitibank’s conduct was fully in accord with its obligations under the FAA and the account \ncontrol agreements, as those agreements must be understood under the FAA.  The FAA requires \nthat Citibank “implement account controls . . . as instructed by EPA.”  CUF ECF 15-1 at Ex. A \n§ I.B.  The FAA also provides that Citibank must “comply with all lawful instructions or directions \nreceived from Treasury,” id. § 5.B.iv, which may be issued “through bulletins, letters, or other \ncommunications,” id. at § 3.D.  And the FAA also provides that Citibank “owes a fiduciary duty \nof loyalty . . . to the United States,” and must “act at all times in the best interests of the United \nStates.”  Id. at § 5.A.   \nCitibank has complied with these obligations:  Citibank implemented account controls by \npausing disbursements in compliance with the Department of Treasury’s instructions on March 4, \n2025 as well as the Department of Treasury’s and EPA’s instructions on March 10, 2025.  See \nBackground at C, supra.  And, while plaintiffs fault Citibank for purportedly failing to disburse \nfunds in “mid-February,” CUF ECF 33-1 at 56-57, that argument also shows no inconsistency with \nCitibank’s obligations, particularly where FBI had raised concerns regarding plaintiffs’ accounts, \nand where Citibank (even where not under an express instruction from the Department of Treasury \nor EPA)  owes a duty of loyalty to “act . . . in the best interests of the United States.”  CUF ECF \n15-1 § 5.A.  \nThe theory that Citibank “decline[d] to act in response to [plaintiff’s] instructions” errs by \nignoring the instructions Citibank has followed.  CUF ECF 33-1 at 56.  Plaintiffs admit that \nCitibank has followed instructions from the government:  Citibank acted due to “efforts to freeze \nPlaintiff’s  funds,”  “Treasury[’s]  direct[ing]  Citibank  to  continue  to  refrain  from  processing \npayments,” and EPA and Treasury’s “direct[ing] Citibank to freeze Plaintiff’s assets.”  See id. at \n15, 19, 35.  Plaintiffs complain that these efforts “violated the APA and the Constitution.”  Id. at \n   15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 20 of 25\n \n35.  But while Citibank takes no position on plaintiffs’ APA and constitutional claims, the point \nfor present purposes is these assertions do not show any contractual breach by Citibank:  Citibank \ncannot have breached its contracts with plaintiffs, when those contracts must be read consistently \nwith the FAA’s mandate that Citibank “act at all times in the best interests of” the government, \nand “comply with all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.”  CUF ECF 15-1 \n§§ 5.A, 5.B.iv.   \nNor is there merit to plaintiffs’ theory that Citibank should have ignored Treasury and \nEPA’s instructions because those instructions were “no[t] . . . lawful.”  CUF ECF 33-1 at 59.  \nPlaintiffs argue that “the ACAs do not provide Citibank with any discretion” and that Citibank’s \n“duties are exclusively ‘administrative or ministerial.’”  Id. at 56.  But that only underscores why \nliability against Citibank is unlikely: the account control agreements do not envision thrusting \nCitibank into a discretionary or decision-making role with respect to what level of fraud is \nnecessary to pause disbursements from GGRF accounts.  Citibank is not vested with discretion to \nsecond-guess whether EPA and the Department of Treasury’s instructions are “lawful.”  Citibank \nis instead bound to “construe the terms of this FAA and any related instructions from Treasury in \na reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of the United States.”  CUF ECF 15-1 \n§ 5.B.ii.   \n Citibank cannot be held liable for following instructions from the government—indeed, \nplaintiffs have acknowledged as much in the very agreements they maintain were breached.  The \nsame account control agreements upon which plaintiffs rely provide that Citibank “shall be entitled \nto rely upon any instruction, notice, or request . . . delivered to it without being required to \ndetermine the authenticity or validity thereof,” and “shall not incur any liability for not performing \nany act or fulfilling any obligation hereunder by reason of any occurrence beyond its control \n   16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 21 of 25\n \n(including, without limitation . . . any governmental authority[)].”  CUF ECF 14-4 § 6.b.  Thus, \nCitibank is not required to assess for itself the lawfulness or other validity of the instructions it \nreceives from EPA or the Department of Treasury, and those instructions cannot be the basis of \nany valid breach-of-contract claims.  The agreements’ plain language leaves no room for doubt; \nplaintiffs’ breach of contract claims lack merit.  See, e.g., Goodrich v. Bank of America, N.A., 2024 \nWL 341064, at *7 (D.D.C. Jan. 30, 2024) (“[T]he language here sufficiently forecloses claims for \nliability—whether  of  a  fiduciary  nature  or  otherwise—if  the  Bank  followed  Goodrich’s \ninstructions.”).   \nCitibank has complied with its contractual obligations at every turn.  Citibank will continue \nthat compliance, and will, of course, follow any order of this Court.  But the Court should refrain \nfrom holding that plaintiffs have any likelihood of success on the merits against Citibank.  Citibank \nhas fully complied with its contractual obligations, as understood by the FAA under which \n“Citibank’s actions are governed.”  CUF ECF 33-1 at 10.   \nII.  IF  THE  COURT  DETERMINES  THAT  IT  LACKS  JURISDICTION  OVER \nCLAIMS  AGAINST  THE  GOVERNMENT,  THEN  CLAIMS  AGAINST \nCITIBANK SHOULD BE DISMISSED OR STAYED.  \nSeparately, in the event the Court holds that it lacks jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims \nagainst the government, that holding would provide an additional reason to hold that plaintiffs lack \na likelihood of success on the merits against Citibank as well.  The government defendants have \npreviously asserted that there is no “waiver of sovereign immunity by the United States as to \nspecific performance for breach of contract.”  See CUF ECF 16 at 19 (EPA TRO Opp.) (quoting \nCoggeshall Dev. Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989)).  The government defendants \nhave thus asserted that claims against them must proceed only in “[t]he United States Court of \nFederal Claims.”  Id. at 15.  Yet if the government has sovereign immunity against claims requiring \n   17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 22 of 25\n \nthe government to perform a contract, then Citibank will be entitled to derivative sovereign \nimmunity as well.  \nThe doctrine of derivative sovereign immunity protects “agents of the sovereign . . . from \nliability for carrying out the sovereign’s will.”  Cunningham v. Gen. Dynamics Info. Tech., Inc., \n888 F.3d 640, 643 (4th Cir. 2018) (CMS contractor protected by derivative sovereign immunity).  \nThe doctrine “applies . . . when a contractor takes actions that are authorized and directed by the \nGovernment of the United States, and performed pursuant to the Act of Congress authorizing the \nagency’s activity.”  In re O.P.M. Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d 42, 69, 442 (D.C. Cir. 2019) \n(quotations omitted).  The critical inquiry is whether the contractor acted at the direction of the \ngovernment:  the doctrine of “derivative sovereign immunity ensures that ‘there is no liability on \nthe part of the contractor who simply performed as the Government directed.’”  Id. (quoting \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 136 S. Ct. 663, 672 (2016)).  That, of course, is exactly the case \nhere:  even plaintiffs’ own allegations and theory of liability is that Citibank has breached the \naccount control agreements only at the “behest” and “direct[ion]” of the United States government.  \nCUF ECF 33-1 at 2.  Plaintiffs assert that Citibank acted pursuant to “illegal government \ndirectives.”  Id. at 4.  Yet if that is true (and to be clear, Citibank does not believe any of its actions \nhave been illegal), derivative sovereign immunity will apply to plaintiffs’ contract claims.  \nThose claims will also require either dismissal or a stay to the extent the Court holds that \njurisdiction over claims regarding the government defendants lies in the Court of Claims.  Citibank \ncannot be sued in the Court of Claims.  “[I]t has been uniformly held, upon a review of the statutes \ncreating the court [of Claims] and defining its authority, that its jurisdiction is confined to . . . suits \nbrought . . . against the United States . . . and if the relief sought is against others than the United \nStates[,] the suit as to them must be ignored as beyond the jurisdiction of the court. . . . [T]he Court \n   18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 23 of 25\n \nof Claims . . . is without jurisdiction of any suit brought against private parties.”  United States v. \nSherwood, 312 U.S. 584, 588 (1941); see, e.g., Sepehry-Fard v. United States, 2022 WL 17335931, \nat *1 (Fed. Cl. Nov. 30, 2022) (“[T]he only proper defendant in this Court is the United States . . . \nPlaintiff’s claims against entities [which included a private bank] other than the United States must \nbe dismissed for that reason alone.”).   \nIf plaintiffs’ claims against the government are sent to the Court of Claims, then the \nlitigation here should not continue against Citibank alone.  Citibank is not the focus of plaintiffs’ \nclaims.  Compare CUF ECF 33-1 at 22-55 (claims against the government), with id. at 56-60 \n(claims against Citibank); see also 3/12/2025 Hr’g Tr. at 28:14-15 (“Citibank, obviously, is in the \nmiddle of all of this.”).  Dismissing parties like Citibank is appropriate where “[t]he Court of \nFederal Claims is actively wresting with the issues presented by this Plaintiff and others.”  Entines \nv. United States, 495 F. Supp. 2d 84, 86 (D.D.C. 2007).  At minimum, the Court should stay \nlitigation against Citibank while claims against the government are decided.  Practical and judicial \neconomy reasons “apply forcefully” when parties seek stays pending the results of parallel \nlitigation, see Hulley Enters. Ltd. v. Russian Federation, 211 F. Supp. 3d 269, 287 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(granting stay), particularly where the parallel litigation here would be against the government, \nwhose directives are the cause of the conduct on which plaintiffs’ claims are based.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should refrain from holding that plaintiffs have a likelihood of success on the \nmerits  of  their  contract  claims  against  Citibank—Citibank  has,  instead,  complied  with  its \ncontractual obligations at every turn.  In the event the Court determines that claims against the \ngovernment must be heard in the Court of Claims, then the Court should dismiss or stay litigation \nagainst Citibank while those claims are resolved.   \n \n   19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 48     Filed 03/26/25     Page 24 of 25\n \nDated:  March 26, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nBy:   /s/ K.

None of those authorities entitles \nPlaintiffs to these funds.  Plaintiffs’ claims for relief are instead necessarily dependent on their \nassertion that the grant agreements themselves restrict the power that EPA would otherwise enjoy \nto terminate the grants.  The agreements do purport to restrict EPA, in language that appears to \nhave been intentionally added in the waning days of the prior Administration in order to tie the \nnew Administration’s hands with respect to disbursement of grant funds (those new contract terms \nmay be void or voidable as a matter of contract law).  But neither those contract defenses, nor \nPlaintiffs’ affirmative claims, are properly before this Court.  At bottom, this is just a run-of-the-\nmill (albeit large) contract dispute.  And, at most, Plaintiffs are entitled to claim damages for this \nasserted breach of contract in the Court of Federal Claims.  After all, EPA has the same rights as \nevery other party when it enters contracts.  See Mobil Oil Expl. and Producing Se. v. United States, \n530 U.S. 604, 607 (2000).  That includes the right to breach and face remedies.  See United States \nv. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839, 919-20 (1996) (Scalia, J, concurring). \nTo distract from this reality, Plaintiffs try to dress up their claims in constitutional, statutory, \nand regulatory garb.  None of this works.  Nothing in the Constitution or any statute compels EPA \nto make these grants to these Plaintiffs; at most, those authorities direct EPA to re-obligate the \nfunds for specified purposes, which EPA has stated it will do.  As for the lengthy list of regulations \nthat Plaintiffs cite to manufacture Administrative Procedure Act (APA) review, none confers any \nright on Plaintiffs to perform their grants.  The regulations actually authorize sweeping termination \nauthority; Plaintiffs’ only response is that the contracts do not repeat that language.  Of course, that \nsimply confirms that these claims rest, ultimately, on the contractual terms. \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 11 of 41\n \nThe real gist of Plaintiffs’ complaints is their contention that EPA did not terminate the \nagreements properly because EPA relied on a reason—its assessment of the agency’s priorities, \nwhich EPA supposedly did not adequately explain—that the agreements did not include as a stated \nground to justify termination.1  To be clear, applicable regulations allow an agency to terminate \nfor consideration of its priorities, which is a determination typically not subject to any APA review \nbecause it is committed to agency discretion.  Here, Plaintiffs’ agreements originally incorporated \nthat basis for termination—but subsequent post-election and post-award amendments stripped \naway the agency’s right.  Even if the amendment modifications are binding (which is questionable \nunder contract law), the change to the grant agreements would at most restrict EPA’s right to \nterminate for cause—that is, without any consequences of breach.  It would not, and could not, \nremove EPA’s right to cease performance and incur any applicable contract liability. \nPut another way, the parties have a legitimate disagreement over whether, as a matter of \ncontract law, EPA’s terminations comported with the terms of their agreements.  If Plaintiffs are \ncorrect, they may be entitled to relief.  But it would be contract relief, which could be sought only \nin the Court of Federal Claims.  And that relief would not include specific performance—forcing \nEPA to proceed with billions of dollars in grants that it has decided no longer advance the interests \nof the United States.  Specific performance is not available against the government.  Plaintiffs’ \n \n1  EPA terminated Plaintiffs’ grants based upon “substantial concerns regarding program \nintegrity” and “misalignment with the Agency’s priorities,” which it further explained include  \n1) the absence of adequate oversight and account controls to prevent financial \nmismanagement; 2) the improper or speculative allocation of funds inconsistent with \nEPA’s oversight and fiscal responsibilities; and 3) the circumvention and defeat of \noversight mechanisms in the disbursement of federal funds. \n \nCoogan Decl., Exhibit I (Termination Letter) at 1.  EPA also determined that the agreements \ninsufficiently guarded against the constitutional proscription against the delegation of authority to \nnon-federal actors.  Id. at 2. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 12 of 41\n \nAPA claims are simply a vehicle to circumvent that black-letter limitation on contract remedies \nagainst the federal government.  The D.C. Circuit has long forbidden that maneuver.  See Sharp v. \nWeinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523-24 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (“The waiver of sovereign immunity in the \n[APA] does not run to actions seeking . . . specific performance in contract cases, because . . . the \nTucker Act and Little Tucker Act impliedly forbid such relief.”).   \nIn short, Plaintiffs are not entitled to the relief they seek because their non-contract claims \nare a mirage, and they offer no authority that would deny the government the same rights that every \nparty enjoys when it chooses to conduct its affairs through contract.  For these reasons, and as \nexplained further below, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction should be denied and the \ncomplaints should instead be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. \nFACTUAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND \nA. The Grant Programs and Awards.  On August 16, 2022, Congress amended the Clean \nAir Act, through the Inflation Reduction Act, to create the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \n(GGRF).  In doing so, Congress appropriated $27 billion towards funding groups to invest in \ncertain climate projects aimed at reducing or avoiding greenhouse gas emissions.  42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(b), (c).  Congress tasked the EPA with determining, on a competitive basis, which particular \ngroups should receive this funding.  Id. § 7434(a)(2).  The EPA accordingly announced three grant \nprograms—the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF), the Clean Communities Investment \nAccelerator (CCIA), and Solar for All (SFA).  In July 2023, EPA published Notices of Funding \nOpportunity (NOFO) and began accepting applications.   \nIn August 2024, EPA awarded Climate United Fund (Climate United) a grant with an \namount of $6.97 billion and grants to Coalition for Green Capital (CGC) and Power Forward \nCommunities (PFC) in the amounts of $5 billion and $2 billion respectively.  \nThe  Grant Agreements  included  specific  terms  and  conditions,  incorporated  various \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 13 of 41\n \nprovisions of the Uniform Grant Guidance, 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339, 340 and 341, and were subject to \nEPA’s then-current 2023-24 General Terms and Conditions.2  Declaration of Dan Coogan (Coogan \nDecl.) Declaration Exhibit A (Grant Agreement).3  The General Terms and Conditions provided \nEPA with the right to terminate the grants “if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities.”  EPA, General Terms and Conditions 2-3 (effective Oct. 1, 2023).  The Grant \nAgreement contains a “Termination” provision, which is preceded by a statement that EPA’s \nfollowing “clarifications to the EPA General Terms and Conditions. . . . expand on, rather than \nreplace or modify, the EPA General Terms and Conditions.”  Grant Agreement at 40 (§ T).  The \nTermination provision purports to establish the “only” bases for termination, but could not “replace \nor modify” the bases for termination set out in EPA’s General Terms and Conditions.  Grant \nAgreement at 40 (§ T).    \nB.  The Late-Breaking Modifications.  After the 2024 presidential election—but before \nthe Inauguration—EPA and Plaintiffs amended their Grant Agreements.  The December 2024 \namendments  incorporated  new,  then-current  2024-25  EPA  Terms  and  Conditions.4    The \namendments also purported to limit EPA’s contractual right to “terminate for noncompliance” by \nrequiring “written determinations and opportunities to cure,” March 26, 2025 Declaration of Eric \n \n2 EPA, General Terms and Conditions (effective Oct. 1, 2023), https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-\ngeneral-terms-and-conditions-effective-october-1-2023-or-later. \n \n3 Each of the Plaintiffs’ grant agreements, and any amendments there to, are materially the same.  \nFor purposes of this filing, Federal Defendants cite to Climate United’s Grant Agreement, for the \nCourt’s convenience. Coogan Decl. Exhibit A contains Climate United’s original August 2024 \ngrant agreement (begins PDF page 2), followed by the December 2024 amendment (Modification \nNumber: 1) (begins PDF page 64), and the January 2025 amendment (Modification Number: 2) \n(begins PDF page 124).  Citations to the Grant Agreement herein are by PDF page number. \n  \n4 EPA, General Terms and Conditions (effective Oct. 1, 2024), https://www.epa.gov/grants/epa-\ngeneral-terms-and-conditions-effective-october-1-2024-or-later. \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 14 of 41\n \nAmidon, EPA, Chief of Staff, (Amidon Decl.) ¶ 28, and to limit EPA’s right to “terminate for \nmisconduct”  by  defining  misconduct  as  limited  “to  ‘credible  evidence’  that  [the  awardee] \ncommitted one or more serious federal crimes or actionable civil violations under the False Claims \nAct.”  Amidon Decl. ¶ 29; Grant Agreement at 75.  \nC.  The Unusual Structure of the Awards.  The Grant Agreements utilized an uncommon \nmethod for financial management of these enormous awards.  Instead of operating through EPA \n(which  would  allow  EPA  real-time  oversight  of  the  use  of  the  funds  and  control  over \ndisbursements), the Grant Agreements called for the use of a designated financial agent to hold the \nentire $20 billion allocated for the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and to administer program \ndistributions.  Grant Agreement at 58.  Defendant Citibank was selected to that role under a \nFinancial Agent Agreement (FAA) with the Department of Treasury.  See Coogan Decl., Exhibit \nB (ACA) at 2.  EPA was not a party to the FAA, but retained certain rights to issue account controls \nin addition to the rights retained by Treasury to issue instructions to Citibank. Amidon Decl. ¶ 31. \nAccording to EPA’s Acting Chief Financial Officer, “EPA had never used a financial agent in \nconnection with a grant program prior to 2024” and “EPA’s use of a financial agent in connection \nwith the GGRF program was the first use of a financial agent for a nonexchange grant program \nadministered  by  the  federal  government.”    Declaration  of  Gregg Treml,  EPA Acting  Chief \nFinancial Officer, (Treml Decl.) ¶¶ 6-7. \nNext, Treasury, EPA, and each grantee entered an Account Control Agreement (ACA) on \nNovember 1, 2024.  The ACAs provide, in relevant part, that EPA possesses a security interest in \nthe Citibank accounts holding program funds.  The ACAs also provide that EPA could exercise its \nrights as a secured party to take control over grant funds held at Citibank by filing a “Notice of \nExclusive Control.”  Amidon Decl. ¶ 33; ACA at 2.  Like the Grant Agreements, the ACA \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 15 of 41\n \nagreements were also amended just days before the presidential transition.  ACA  19.  On January \n13, 2025, EPA, Citibank, and the grantees amended the ACAs so that “EPA’s filing of a Notice of \nExclusive Control would no longer result in [awardees] needing to obtain EPA’s consent before \ninstructing Citibank to disburse funds for expenses [the awardees] consider[] ‘properly incurred’.”  \nAmidon Decl. ¶ 34; ACA at 19.  Another vestige of accountability was thus stripped away. \nD.  The New Administration’s Investigation and Terminations of the Grants.  Upon \nassuming office, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and other EPA officials began to learn more about \nthis program and to express concerns with the GGRF program’s creation and implementation.5  \nSee EPA TRO Opp. at 11 and Amidon Decl. ¶¶ 3-12.    \nUpon review of the Grant Agreements, the ACAs, and their amendments, “EPA determined \nthat the Biden Administration’s contractual scheme for administering the NCIF grants did not \nprovide sufficient oversight and transparency to accomplish these stewardship obligations and \nobjectives.”  Amidon Decl. ¶ 19.  EPA also determined that “the amendments of December 20, \n2024 and January 13, 2025—which limited EPA’s contractual rights to terminate for misconduct \nshort of a federal crime and limited EPA’s contractual rights to assert exclusive control over funds \nin the Citibank accounts—left EPA with insufficient authority to retain control of funds short of \n \n5 These concerns were not new.   The House Committee on Energy and Commerce expressed \nserious concerns about EPA’s “unusually accelerated timeline for disbursement” and “new and \ncomplex  funding  structure”  in  October  2023,    Declaration  of  Kevin  Bailey  (Bailey  Decl.) \nDeclaration Exhibit A, and subsequently investigated “recipient eligibility issues,” “the fairness \nand uniformity of the selection process,” and the fact that “individuals with strong ties to \nDemocratic politics hold significant leadership roles within some of the organizations the EPA \nselected to receive funding” in December 2024, id. Ex. B.  The Committee also held an oversight \nhearing on the subject in January 2024.  Amidon Decl. ¶ 14.  And EPA’s Inspector General testified \nto the Committee in September 2024 that EPA’s Office of Inspector General lacked sufficient \nresources to protect against fraud risks in the GGRF program and ensure efficient use of public \nfunds given EPA’s “pace of spending.”  Id. ¶ 15. \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 16 of 41\n \noutright termination.”  Id. ¶ 37.  \nEPA referred to its Office of Inspector General its findings “on financial mismanagement, \nconflicts of interest, and oversight failures with the GGRF program” for further investigation.  \nAmidon Decl. ¶¶ 35, 38; Coogan Decl., Exhibit C (OIG Letter) at 1.  An investigation was initiated \nand remains ongoing.  Amidon Decl. ¶ 40.  The Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation have also initiated criminal investigations into the GGRF program for “potential \nfraud, waste, abuse, and impermissible conflicts of interest in connection with NCIF and CCIA \ngrants”; these too remain ongoing.  Id.  ¶ 39.   \nOn March 11, EPA issued a notice terminating each Plaintiff’s Grant Agreement under the \nGGRF program.  Coogan Decl., Exhibit I (Termination Letter) at 1.  In the notice, EPA explained \nthat “termination is based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, \nprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which \ncollectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”6  Id.  \nPROCEDURAL HISTORY  \nPlaintiffs Climate United, CGC, and PFC filed complaints for declaratory and injunctive \nrelief on March 8, March 12 and March 14, 2025, respectively.  See No. 25-cv-698, ECF No.1 \n(Climate United Complaint) 7; No. 25-cv-735, ECF No. 1 (CGC Complaint); No. 25-cv-762, ECF \nNo.  1  (PFC  Complaint).    Plaintiffs  followed  those  complaints  with  motions  for  temporary \n \n6 On March 17, 2025, pursuant to the Court’s instructions at the March 12, 2025 hearing and in the \nMarch 14, 2025 minute order, EPA filed the declaration of Eric Amidon, EPA’s Chief of Staff, \nsetting forth the basis for its March 11, 2025 termination of the Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements.  ECF \nNo.. 25-1.  With the benefit of additional time, EPA provides a second, supplemental declaration \nof Mr. Amidon that provides a more comprehensive discussion of the “decision to reconsider the \nEPA’s approach to administering the [NCIF Program] and to terminate [Plaintiffs’] NCIF grant \nawards . . . on March 11, 2025.”  Amidon Decl. ¶ 2. \n \n7 Climate United amended its complaint on March 17, 2025.  No. 25-cv-698, ECF No. 24 (CU \nAmended Compliant)  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 17 of 41\n \nrestraining orders.  See No. 25-cv-698, ECF No. 2 (Climate United) No. 25-cv-735, ECF No. 9 \n(CGC); No. 25-cv-762, ECF No. 4 (PFC).  On March 12 and March 17, the Court heard arguments \non Plaintiffs’ motions.  No. 25-cv-698, ECF No. 21 (March 12 Hearing), ECF No. 26 (March 17 \nHearing), ECF No. 30  (Consolidation Order).   On March 18, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ \ntemporary relief, which effectively froze the grant funds in the Citibank accounts pending further \nproceedings.  No. 25-cv-698, ECF Nos. 28, 29.   The instant motion for preliminary injunctive \nrelief followed.  EPA intends in due course to move to dismiss the actions for lack of jurisdiction. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n“The standard for issuance of the ‘extraordinary and drastic remedy’ of a temporary \nrestraining order or a preliminary injunction is very high, and by now very well established.”  \nC.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 197 (D.D.C. 2020).  A movant seeking such an extraordinary \nremedy “bears the burden of making a clear showing” that it is “entitled to such relief.”  Id.  To \nmake such a showing, Plaintiff bears the burden of establishing (1) it is likely to “succeed on the \nmerits,” (2) it is “likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,” (3) “the \nbalance of the equities tips in [its] favor,” and (4) “an injunction is in the public interest.”  Id.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Cannot Invoke the APA To Challenge Alleged Breaches of Contract. \nPlaintiffs principally rely on the APA to challenge the EPA’s grant terminations.  But, \ndespite Plaintiffs’ best efforts to recast them, these claims sound in contract—which means this \nCourt cannot exercise jurisdiction under the APA.  The APA provides a limited waiver of the \ngovernment’s sovereign immunity for claims “seeking relief other than monetary damages.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 702.  But the APA’s waiver “comes with an important carve-out”:  it does not apply “ ‘if \nany other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is \nsought.’ ”  Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 18 of 41\n \n215 (2012) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  That carve-out “prevents plaintiffs from invoking the APA’s \nwaiver to evade limitations on suit contained in other statutes.”  Id.   \nThat is what Plaintiffs are trying to do here.  Their complaints and motions seek access to \nfunds that they believe the government is obligated to pay them under the terms of their contracts \n(the Grant Agreements)—indeed, they effectively seek to compel specific performance of those \nalleged contractual commitments.  But contract claims must be pursued under the Tucker Act, not \nthe APA.  The Tucker Act provides that the “United States Court of Federal Claims shall have \njurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim against the United States founded” on “any express \nor implied contract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a).  The D.C. Circuit has long \nrecognized that “the Tucker Act impliedly forbids” the bringing of “contract actions” against “the \ngovernment in a federal district court” under the APA.  Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of the \nFed. Rsrv. Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004).  That jurisdictional divide \nensures that contract claims against the government are channeled to the court that has “unique \nexpertise” in that area.  Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  \nHere, that principle precludes the relief that Plaintiffs seek from this Court. \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Contract Claims for Specific Performance. \nPlaintiffs seek to enjoin EPA from terminating their Grant Agreements.  But both the \n“source of the rights” they invoke, and “type of relief” they seek, demonstrate that these are \ncontract claims beyond the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain.  See Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, \n672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  \nAs to the source of rights, everything hinges on the terms of the Grant Agreements. \nPlaintiffs assert that EPA violated the APA in terminating the Grant Agreements to further EPA’s \nown program goals or agency priorities because “the Terms and Conditions do not give EPA the \nright to terminate the grants for convenience or based on a change in EPA’s policy priorities.”  PI \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 19 of 41\n \nMotion at 4.  The regulation that Plaintiffs rely upon is incorporated into the terms of the Grant \nAgreements. Grant Agreements at 41.  While the provisions incorporate regulations, that “does not \ntransform the action into one based solely on those regulations.”  Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United \nStates, 78 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  In Ingersoll, the D.C. Circuit rejected a plaintiff’s attempt \nto recharacterize breach of contract claims as APA claims by arguing that the agency’s decision to \nterminate a contract also violated federal regulations.  Id. at 77-78.  The same reasoning applies \nhere.   \nPlaintiffs’  own  arguments  demonstrate  that  their  source  of  rights  stem  from  their \nagreements. Plaintiffs argue that the “regulations that apply to Plaintiffs’ grants do not permit \ntermination on policy grounds because those grounds are not stated in the terms of the awards,” \nsee PI Motion at 39 (emphasis added); see also id. at 9 (asserting that the Grant Agreements Terms \nand Conditions applied the version of 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 effective as of October 1, 2024).  The \nonly reason why “[t]here is no right to terminate based on changed priorities,” as argued by \nPlaintiffs, is because the “Terms and Conditions governing Plaintiffs’ grants limit EPA only to three \npossible grounds for termination.”  Id. at 28 (emphasis in original); see also id. at 4 (stating that \nthe Grant Agreements’ Terms and Conditions limit EPA to only three grounds for termination); id. \nat 30 (stating that EPA may not terminate based on its need for oversight and concerns about lack \nof control under the regulations because they are not included in the Grant Agreements); id. at 33 \n(stating that the Grant Agreements do not allow termination for changes in agency priorities) \nThus, absent the Grant Agreements, Plaintiffs would have no claim to NCIF funds and \naxiomatically no right to perform under their Grant Agreements.  As discussed further below, the \nConstitution affords no right to receive or perform a grant.  Neither does the Inflation Reduction \nAct.  At most, those sources of law impose certain duties on EPA—but they plainly confer no \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 20 of 41\n \nrelevant rights on these Plaintiffs.  See Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (plaintiffs “right to . . . payments is created in the first instance by the contract, \nnot by the Debt Collection Act. The DCA, even if it applied, confers no such right in the absence \nof the contract itself.  Although the DCA might impose procedural requirements on the government \nhaving some impact on the contract, the Act in no way creates the substantive right to the remedy \n[plaintiff] seeks.).    \nPlaintiffs also cite a host of regulations.  Certain regulations may define the parameters \nunder which the grant may operate, but they too afford no individual rights to Plaintiffs that would \nexist independent of their contractual rights or separate from their status as parties to the Grant \nAgreements.  To the contrary, the regulations repeatedly refer to the terms of the grant agreements \nto specify the agency’s rights to terminate.  See, e.g., 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 (a)(1), (4) (award may be \nterminated if the “recipient . . . fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” \nor “pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award”).  Ultimately, then, it is clear that \nPlaintiffs’ source of rights lies in the fact that they are grant recipients, that is, contracting parties.  \nAnd their only meaningful claim of injury is that their grants were terminated for reasons not \nauthorized by their Grant Agreements.  There is no source for Plaintiffs’ asserted rights other than \ntheir claim of the contractual right to perform under the grants they were awarded.  \nAs to the second Megapulse factor, the type of relief sought, Plaintiffs seek relief that is \ncontractual—namely, specific performance.  This is not a case in which the Court has been asked \nto simply “set aside” agency action.  5 U.S.C. § 706.  Plaintiffs complain about the sufficiency of \nEPA’s explanation of the reasons for its termination decisions, but they do not ask the Court to \norder EPA to provide a more fulsome explanation for why the grants no longer effectuate agency \npriorities.  Cf. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct 1891 (2020); Palisades \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 21 of 41\n \nGen. Hosp., Inc. v. Leavitt, 426 F.3d 400, 403 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  Instead, Plaintiffs conflate APA \nand contract concepts to pray for a remedy that would deny EPA any right to end the parties’ \nagreements even when EPA determines the agreements no longer effectuate the agency’s goals and \npriorities.  That remedy is not relief available under the APA.  Calling it “vacatur” of the \ntermination decisions is merely slapping an APA label on what, in function and practice, amounts \nto the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.  See Spectrum, 764 F.2d at 894 \n(“Spectrum seeks an order compelling the government to pay money owed in exchange for goods \nprocured under an executory contract. In other words, Spectrum seeks the classic contractual \nremedy of specific performance.”).  If that sufficed, nothing would be left of the Megapulse line \nof precedent or the principle that it vindicates. \nTo be clear, this is not a case in which EPA has acted outside statutory or regulatory \nauthority separate and apart from contractual terms.  Again, applicable regulations allow an agency \nto terminate a grant when that grant “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  Plaintiffs’ grants expressly recognized EPA’s authority to terminate for \nthat very reason when they were first awarded in August 2024.8  To be sure, Plaintiffs assert that \nEPA voluntarily relinquished that contractual right in the December 2024 amendment to the Grant \n \n8  The Grant Agreements provide that specific clauses, including the Termination provision (§ T.4), \ndo not “replace or modify[] the EPA General Terms and Conditions.” § T.  EPA’s then-current \n2023-24 General Terms and Conditions, incorporated into the original Grant Agreements, provided \nEPA with the right to terminate the grants “if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities.”  EPA, General Terms and Conditions 2-3 (effective Oct. 1, 2023).  Inexplicably, \nsection T.4 begins with contradictory language:  “Notwithstanding the General Term and Condition \n‘Termination’ . . . ”   \n \nThe Grant Agreement was bilaterally negotiated and it provides explicitly that modifications can \nonly be made through bilateral consent.  § AI.  As such, the parties share responsibility for the \nconfusion caused by this drafting.  However, the fact remains that EPA’s General Terms and \nConditions as originally adopted in the Grant Agreements preserved EPA’s right to terminate the \nagreements to effectuate program goals and agency priorities. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 22 of 41\n \nAgreements.  But even if that alteration were binding as a matter of contract, it is a matter of \ncontract.  It is not the regulations that bar EPA from terminating on this basis; at most, it is the \ncontract terms.  That leaves no doubt that Plaintiffs’ claims, at bottom, are rooted in contract. \nThere is another problem that exposes the contractual nature of Plaintiffs’ claims.  In asking \nthe Court to compel EPA to continue to act as their contractual counterparty, Plaintiffs seek to deny \nEPA its own inherent contractual right to breach.  Like any other contracting party, the government \nis entitled to decide to breach a contract and incur the resulting liability (such as reliance damages).  \nRecognizing that principle, “a distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign’s immunity from \nbeing compelled to perform obligations it prefers to breach and compensate financially, holding \nthat what are ‘in essence’ claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the Tucker Act and its \nprohibition on equitable relief by being artfully pled as something else.”  McKay v. United States, \n516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008).  The D.C. Circuit has long adopted that principle.  See Sharp, \n798 F.2d at 1523-24 (“The waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions \nseeking . . . specific performance in contract cases, because . . . the Tucker Act and Little Tucker \nAct impliedly forbid such relief.”); see also Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. \n682, 704 (1949); Robbins v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 438 F.3d 1074, 1083 (10th Cir. 2006); \nCoggeshall Dev. Corp. v. Diamond, 884 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1989) (“We are unaware of any waiver \nof sovereign immunity by the United States as to specific performance for breach of contract.”).  \nTreating claims like these as APA claims leading to the relief of “vacatur” would allow Plaintiffs \nto evade the prohibition on specific performance through artful pleading.  Or, put another way, \neven if Plaintiffs were entirely correct about the terms and meaning of the Grant Agreements, and \nabout the material facts, that would still entitle them at most to certain contract remedies—it would \nnot subject EPA to compulsion to proceed with contracts it wants to terminate. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 23 of 41\n \nThe prohibition against compelling the government’s performance exists for good reason. \nAs the Supreme Court explained, “it is one thing to provide a method by which a citizen may be \ncompensated for a wrong done to him by the Government.  It is a far different matter to permit a \ncourt to exercise its compulsive power to restrain the Government from acting, or to compel it to \nact.”  Larson, 337 U.S. at 704.  This is exactly what Plaintiffs seek here: for the court to use its \n“compulsive power” to “restrain” the government from cancelling its agreements and “compel” \nthe government to indefinitely maintain the contractual arrangement against its will.   \nFinally, the cases Plaintiffs rely upon do not support the exercise of jurisdiction here.  The \nbest-reasoned recent decision on this issue actually confirms EPA’s position and refutes Plaintiffs’ \ntheory. \nTo start, Plaintiffs cannot take refuge in Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988).  In \nBowen, the Supreme Court recognized that setting aside agency action could permit a party to \nreceive money authorized by statute, and would therefore be in the nature of specific relief, not \nmoney damages.  That is surely correct, but this case is very different.  Here, the monetary relief \nis not merely some downstream consequence of vacating agency action like a regulation or order—\nthe action that Plaintiffs directly challenge is itself contractual in nature (the termination of the \ngrants).  Their request to the Court is to bind EPA to (their interpretation) of the contract terms, \nand  thereby  limit  EPA  to  the  specific  bases  for  termination  in  the  December  2024  Grant \nAgreements’ amendments.  To provide that relief would be to compel specific performance of the \namended termination clause in the agreement.  No fair or plausible reading of Bowen provides \nauthority to specifically enforce a contractual promise.  This is a transparent end-run. \nPlaintiffs also cite Crowley Gov’t Services, Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099 (D.C. Cir. 2022), \nwhich reviewed this Court’s well-settled test for distinguishing APA claims from Tucker Act claims \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 24 of 41\n \nbut did so in circumstances that were completely different than this case.  In Crowley, the plaintiffs’ \ncomplaint concerned administrative action undertaken by an agency that had no contractual \nrelationship with the plaintiff.  Id. at 1109.   \nAs for Megapulse, 672 F.2d 959, its test governs but its facts are even farther afield.  The \ncase concerned the release of proprietary information and the plaintiff’s claimed injury involved \nthat release—not the contract.  Here, by contrast, Plaintiffs would have no basis to allege injury \n(let alone any violation of rights) absent their Grant Agreements.  The principle that applies here \nis therefore straightforward: “Under [the D.C. Circuit’s] decisions, if the case before us is a \n‘contract case,’ the APA does not waive the sovereign’s immunity from suit.”  Transohio Sav. Bank. \nv. Dir. Office of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (abrogated on other grounds \nby Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).   \nAnother Judge of this Court recently adopted the government’s view on this issue, and \nrejected Plaintiffs’ circumvention, in U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, \nNo. 25-cv-465, 2025 WL 763738, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025).  There, the Court held that the \nTucker Act precluded plaintiffs from asserting, in federal district court, putative APA claims \nasserting that the agency violated the very same termination provision relied on here, 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340.9  EPA respectfully submits that Judge McFadden analyzed this issue correctly, and this \nCourt should follow that ruling here. \nUltimately, this Court should recognize that EPA retains the ability to end its agreements, \nwhether or not doing so complies with a (contested) for-cause termination provision.  Contract law \nrecognizes every party’s right to perform or face remedies for breach.  Winstar, 518 U.S. at 919-\n \n9 The plaintiff in that case has filed an appeal and sought relief pending appeal, which remains \npending at this time.  See No. 25-5066 (D.C. Cir.).   \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 25 of 41\n \n20 (Scalia, J. concurring); Boaz Hous. Auth. v. United States, 994 F.3d 1359, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2021) \n(to the extent that the government has implemented its grant programs by “employ[ing] contracts \nto set the terms of and receive commitments from recipients,” the proper recourse for any asserted \nviolation of those grant terms is a “suit in the Claims Court for damages”); Horwitz-Matthews, Inc. \nv City of Chicago, 78 F.3d 1248, 1250-51 (7th Cir. 1996); Benderson Dev. Co., Inc. v. U.S. Postal \nServ., 998 F.2d 959, 962 (Fed. Cir. 1992).  That principle applies equally to the government.  See \nSpectrum, 764 F.2d. at 894 (rejecting “an injunction requiring the government to pay monies \nowed” where “right to these payments is created in the first instance by the contract, not by the” \nrelevant statute, because the statute “confers no such right in the absence of the contract itself”).   \nAs another Judge of this Court recently put it: “When a contract is terminated, even \nwrongfully, there is no longer a contract – no duty to perform and no right to demand performance, \n. . . there is only a right to seek and a duty to pay damages caused by the termination. . . .Thus, \neven a party that lacks the authority to terminate a contract may do so anyway.”  Printing \nPackaging & Prod. Union of N. Am. v. Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters, No. 23-1872 (TJK), 2024 WL \n3835353, at *7 (D.D.C. Aug. 15, 2024).  That principle alone defeats Plaintiffs’ APA claims here. \nB.  Plaintiffs Improperly Challenge Funding Decisions Committed to Agency Discretion.   \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed in this case because they challenge funding decisions \nthat are committed to agency discretion by law.  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  Review under the APA is \nunavailable “if a statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which \nto judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 830 (1985).  There \nis no waiver of sovereign immunity where agency action requires “complicated balancing of a \nnumber of factors which are peculiarly within [agency’s] expertise”: whether its “resources are \nbest spent” on one program or another; whether it “is likely to succeed” in fulfilling its statutory \nmandate; whether a particular program “best fits the agency’s overall policies”; and, “indeed, \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 26 of 41\n \nwhether the agency has enough resources” to fund a program “at all” and the “agency is far better \nequipped than the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its \npriorities.”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993) (quoting Heckler, 480 U.S. at 831-32).  \nEPA’s determination that the current structure of the Grant Agreements does not afford the \nagency the oversight and account controls necessary for the agency to properly discharge the \nagency’s responsibilities is a matter uniquely within EPA’s expertise and a matter committed to its \ndiscretion.  See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192.  In Lincoln, the Supreme Court recognized that an agency \ndecision to change prior funding decisions presented a matter committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.  Id. at 185-88.  Here, Congress entrusted EPA “to make grants, on a competitive basis” for \ndistinct purposes, 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a), and left it to EPA to design its programs and provide \nappropriate oversight and control.  See id. § 7434(a)(1) (“carry out other greenhouse gas emission \nreduction activities, as determined appropriate by the Administrator” (emphasis added)).  As in \nLincoln, Congress gave the agency “the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its \nstatutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective or desirable way,” id. at 192, and \nPlaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on their effort to intrude upon the agency’s exercise of discretion.  \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Constitutional and Statutory Claims Do Not Support Relief.  \n  Although their APA claims are the main focus of the briefing, Plaintiffs also assert claims \nunder the Appropriations Clause, Due Process Clause, and the authorizing and appropriating \nlegislation of the Inflation Reduction Act itself.  Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on any of those \nill-fitting claims—and none of them could possibly support the preliminary injunctive relief that \nPlaintiffs seek here. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 27 of 41\n \nA.   Termination Does Not Implicate the Appropriations Clause, and Plaintiffs Lack \nStanding Under the Clause.   \nThere is no plausible Appropriations Clause claim here, and it is difficult to discern \nPlaintiffs’ basis for maintaining such a claim.  The Appropriations Clause provides “simply that \nno money can be paid out of the Treasury unless it has been appropriated by an act of Congress.” \nOff. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S 414, 424 (1990).  EPA has not paid any money out of \nthe Treasury absent appropriation by Congress and Plaintiffs make no argument to the contrary.  \nNor has EPA failed to use appropriations as directed by Congress.  EPA timely awarded grants in \naccord with 42 U.S.C. § 7434 and now simply seeks to manage the program in a manner with \nwhich Plaintiffs disagree.  Plaintiffs have no Appropriations Clause claim.  Cf. Hein v. Freedom \nReligion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 593 (2007) (“federal courts would cease to function as courts \nof law and would be cast in the role of general complaint bureaus” if “every federal taxpayer could \nsue to challenge any Government expenditure.”).  \nThe few decisions that have entertained private party claims under the Appropriations \nClause have not sought to compel the government to disburse money, as Plaintiffs do here.  Rather, \nthey sought to halt the Executive from disbursing funding.  See United States v. McIntosh, 833 \nF.3d 1163, 1173-75 (9th Cir. 2016) (plaintiffs had standing to pursue Appropriations Clause claim \nwhere the ostensibly unappropriated funding was used to prosecute them); United States v. Trump, \n740 F. Supp. 3d 1245, 1304 n.65 (S.D. Fla 2024) (similar); United States v. Stone, 394 F. Supp. 3d \n1, 19 n.13 (D.D.C. 2019) (similar).  Plaintiffs cite no authority supporting their reliance upon the \nAppropriations Clause to force the government to fund their grants—which is quite backwards. \nFinally, In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. Cir. 2013), and Train v. City of New York, \n420 U.S. 35 (1975), have no relevance here.  Those cases concerned policy disagreements with \nCongress.  In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259; Train, 420 U.S. at 42-43.  Here, EPA terminated \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 28 of 41\n \nPlaintiffs’ Grant Agreements as part of its administration of the programs Congress authorized it \nto administer.  There is no separation of powers concern with what EPA did (only with what \nPlaintiffs are asking this Court to do).  The Executive Branch remains free to change positions \nupon changes in administration.  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222 (2016).  \nThat  is  exactly  what  happened  here;  EPA,  for  the  “normal  and  orderly  operation  of  the \ngovernment,” City of New Haven, Conn. v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 907 (D.C Cir. 1987) \n(quoting H.R. Rep. No. 658, 93d Cong., 1st Sess. 41, reprinted in 1974 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. \nNews 3462, 3486–87), terminated the grants and in so doing announced its intention to “work to \nre-obligate lawfully appropriated funds, within the GGRF program with enhanced controls to \nensure  adequate  governance,  transparency,  and  accountability,  consistent  with  applicable \nregulatory and statutory requirements.”  Once more, if Plaintiffs claim injury based upon EPA’s \ndecision, their remedy lies only in contract.  The Appropriations Clause has nothing to do with it. \nB.  Termination  Does  Not  Implicate  the  Appropriations  Deadline  in  the  Inflation \nReduction Act. \nPlaintiffs’ Inflation Reduction Act claim has no foundation whatsoever.  Although they \nraise a specter that deadlines have been violated, statutory mandates may not be followed, and \nfunds may not be used appropriately, those contentions have no basis in fact. \n  Section 134 (42 U.S.C. § 7434) required that EPA “make grants” and stated that the \nappropriated funds would be available for that purpose until September 30, 2024.  EPA fulfilled \nthat statutory requirement timely.  Plaintiffs’ very existence demonstrates that EPA satisfied the \nrequirements of the statute.  No part of the statute constrains EPA’s authority to reprogram funds \nas part of its GGRF program operation.  In fact, Plaintiffs’ contentions to the contrary contradict \ntheir own agreements.  In the Grant Agreements, in two separate places, Plaintiffs expressly agreed \nand recognized conditions under which EPA was required to de-obligate and re-obligate funding. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 29 of 41\n \nGrant Agreement at 39 (T.4) and at 52 (AF).  And Plaintiffs confirmed EPA’s right to de-obligate \nand re-obligate funds in December 2024, well after the September 30, 2024 date they now, for \nlitigation purposes, contend is somehow inviolate.  Grant Agreement (amended December 2024) \nat 41 (T.4) and 51 (AF).  \nC.  Termination Did Not Violate Due Process, Because the Tucker Act Provides All the \nProcess Due. \nPlaintiffs’ complaints about due process and assertions of property rights in NCIF grant \nfunds have no purchase.  Plaintiffs have only those rights granted under their contracts, and a party \nwhose rights derive from a federal contract cannot maintain a separate claim based upon a property \ninterest.  Hughes Commc’ns Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, 271 F.3d 1060, 1070 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \nPlaintiffs are incorrect in asserting that they own the grant funds obligated by their \nagreements.  Under the Grant Agreements, Plaintiffs “must maintain” the grant funds at their \nCitibank accounts, which are subject to EPA’s perfected security interest, “until the Closeout \nAgreement goes into effect.”  Grant Amendment at 118.  Only if Plaintiffs had completed \nperformance would Plaintiffs possess a contract basis “to transfer any remaining funds ... to an \naccount ... of [Plaintiffs’] choosing.”  Id.  Plaintiffs otherwise were required to spend the funds on \nallowed uses under the grants.  See id. at 27 (“[Plaintiffs agree] to only use the award to support \nthe following allowable activities: [listed allowed activities]”).  The Notice of Award reflected \nEPA’s agreement to a “cost-share of 100% of all approved budget period costs incurred” up to the \naward amount.  Grant Agreement at 1.  Stated simply, Plaintiffs had to perform the grants to \nbecome entitled to the funds outright.  Until they incur a program cost on an approved budget, \nPlaintiffs have no claim to the money.  See In re Joliet-Will Cnty. Cmty. Action Agency, 847 F.2d \n430, 432 (7th Cir. 1988) (finding that federal grant funds did not constitute debtor’s bankruptcy \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 30 of 41\n \nestate because the debtor had no property interest in the grant money and property purchased with \nthat money). \nBecause Plaintiffs only gained an interest in the NCIF grant funds by performing the \ncontracts, their due process claims are nothing more than another set of contract claims.  See \nOlympic Fed. Sav. And Loan Ass’n v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision., Civ. A. No. 90-0482, 1990 \nWL 134841, at *8-9 (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 1990) (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967).  Plaintiffs may \nnot use their due process claim as “an alternative legal vehicle” through which to enforce their \ncontract rights under the Grant Agreements.10  Id. at *8. \nIII.  Even If Jurisdiction Existed, Plaintiffs Are Not Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \nBeyond their jurisdictional deficiencies, Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits and \ntherefore are not entitled to injunctive relief.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009).  Faced \nwith grant agreements under which the agency had failed to ensure appropriate oversight, EPA \nmade a lawful and reasoned decision to terminate Plaintiffs’ grants and announced its intention to \nre-obligate GGRF funds under more responsible agreements.  That decision was rational and \nsupported by the terms of the grants.  Indeed, it was compelled by basic principles of fiduciary \nduty, good government, and respect for taxpayers.  As explained above, termination also did not \nviolate the Constitution or the Inflation Reduction Act.  \n \n10 The Court should disregard Plaintiffs’ appeal to general equitable powers. See PI Motion 25-26.  \n“It is axiomatic that federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction.” Srour v. Barnes, 670 F. Supp. \n18, 20 (D.D.C. 1973).  “The power of federal courts of equity to enjoin unlawful executive action \nis subject to express and implied statutory limitations.”  Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015).  And the “express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive \nrule suggests that Congress intended to preclude others.”  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n290  (2001).    Plaintiffs’  reliance  on  broad  and  generalized  statements  regarding  equitable \njurisdiction adds nothing to the merits of their claims. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 31 of 41\n \nA.  EPA’s Termination of Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements Was Not Arbitrary or Capricious \nThe APA’s “arbitrary and capricious” standard, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), is “highly deferential \nand presumes the validity of agency action.” Sissel v. Wormuth, 77 F.4th 941, 947 (D.C. Cir. 2023); \nsee also Husky Mktg. & Supply Co. v. FERC, 105 F.4th 418, 421 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (judicial review \nunder APA standard is “is deferential and narrow in scope.”).  A court reviewing agency action \nunder the arbitrary-and-capricious standard should only set aside an agency decision if “there has \nbeen a clear error of judgement” “based on a consideration of the relevant factors.”  Preserve \nOverton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 416 (1971).  The court “may not substitute its own \njudgment for that of the agency.”  Columbia Gulf Transmission v. FERC, 106 F.4th 1220, 1230 \n(D.C. Cir. 2024).  Instead, the court must “simply ensure[] that the agency has acted within a zone \nof reasonableness,” and an agency decision must be upheld so long as it is “reasonable and \nreasonably explained.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).   \ni.  EPA’s Termination of Plaintiffs’ Grants was Reasonable and Reasonably Explained. \nEPA’s  termination  of  Plaintiffs’  Grant Agreements  was  reasonable.    Under  the  new \nadministration, new EPA officials prudently reviewed EPA’s spending.  Amidon Decl. ¶ 36.  A \nchange in administration “is a perfectly reasonable basis for an executive agency’s reappraisal of \nthe costs and benefits of its programs.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. \nAuto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 59 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). “As \nlong as the agency remains within the bounds established by Congress, it is entitled to assess \nadministrative records and evaluate priorities in light of the philosophy of the administration.”   \nId.; see also Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 781 (2019).  Within the bounds set by \nCongress, the agency discretion applies in the grants context as readily as it does in other spheres \nof activity. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 32 of 41\n \nUpon review, EPA determined that the level of oversight provided in Plaintiffs’ Grant \nAgreements was exceedingly insufficient.11  Modifications to the agreements post-election, on \nDecember 20, 2024 and January 13, 2025, purportedly “limit[ing] EPA’s contractual rights,” “left \nEPA with insufficient authority to retain control of funds short of outright termination.”  Amidon \nDecl. ¶ 37. \nThe Termination Letter explains that the Grant Agreements lacked “adequate oversight and \naccount controls to prevent financial mismanagement,” was deficient with respect to “the improper \nor speculative allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s oversight and fiscal responsibilities,” \nand involved “the circumvention and defeat of key oversight mechanisms in the disbursement of \nfederal funds.”  Termination Letter at 1.  The letter further explains that the GGRF program \n“pose[d] an unacceptable risk to the efficient and lawful execution of [the GGRF] grant that cannot \nbe remedied by imposing specific conditions, necessitating immediate termination to safeguard \ntaxpayer funds  and ensure compliance  with federal  assistance  regulations.”  Id.  EPA also \nreasonably  terminated  the  grants  based  on  concerns  that  the  previous Administration  had \nsignificantly reduced federal oversight and control to Plaintiffs and a financial agent that the \ncontractual scheme violated constitutional limitations on the delegation of Executive Branch \nauthority to private parties.  Amidon Decl. ¶ 37.  The December 20, 2024 and January 13, 2025 \namendments diminished EPA’s control over the recipients, as the contracts purported to prevent \ntermination absent credible evidence of an enumerated list of crimes and violations.  Id.   \n \n11 To reiterate, EPA has not  abandoned the GGRF program.  The Termination Letter provides that \n“EPA will work to re-obligate lawfully appropriated funds within the GGRF program with \nenhanced controls to ensure adequate governance, transparency, and accountability, consistent \nwith applicable regulatory and statutory requirements.” Termination Letter at 2.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 33 of 41\n \nThese explanations—as described in Mr. Amidon’s declaration; the pending criminal \ninvestigations  by  the  DOJ  and  FBI;  and  the  EPA  Office  of  Inspector  General’s  ongoing \ninvestigation—confirm that EPA’s decision to terminate Plaintiffs’ grant agreements falls plainly \nwell within “a zone of reasonableness,” Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. at 423, that merits \nthis Court’s deference under APA review.  The APA merely requires an explanation clear enough \nfor “the agency’s path [to] reasonably be discerned” and to facilitate effective review.  Bowman \nTransp., Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 (1974).  The fact that the \nPlaintiffs’ Grant Agreements were treated similarly and terminated in tandem does not undermine \nthe reasonableness of EPA’s decision making.  To the contrary, treating similarly situated grants \nequally honors the APA, for “[r]easoned decisionmaking requires treating like cases alike.”  Hall \nv. McLaughlin, 864 F.2d 868, 872 (D.C. Cir. 1989).   \nEven if the terminations are deemed a change in agency policy (which they are not), EPA’s \npriorities are matters of policy discretion and not a result of “factual findings”; accordingly, a shift \nin those priorities does not require any additional explanation under the APA.  FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).  EPA needed only to “display awareness that \nit is changing position,” id., which it plainly did.   \nIn reality, Plaintiffs’ problem with EPA’s grant terminations is not that EPA failed to give \nsufficient explanation—their objection is that the reasonable explanation that EPA provided does \nnot align with what are (in Plaintiffs’ view) the exclusive grounds for termination that are set forth \nin the Grant Agreements.  Once again, that returns to where we began: Even if that were all true, \nit proves these are contract claims at heart, not APA reasoned-decisionmaking claims. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 34 of 41\n \nii.  EPA Complied with its Regulations in Terminating the Grants. \nEPA’s termination did not violate 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, which sets out four methods by which \nan agency “may” terminate a grant, including when “an award no longer effectuates the program \ngoals or agency priorities.”  § 200.340(a)(4).  The currently operative version of the regulation \nthen provides that the agency “must clearly and unambiguously specify all termination provisions \nin the terms and conditions of the” grant.  § 200.340(b).  EPA satisfied this requirement at contract \nformation, by incorporating EPA’s then-current General Terms and Conditions, which provided \nEPA with the right to terminate the grants “if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities.”  EPA, General Terms and Conditions 2-3 (effective Oct. 1, 2023).  At issue is \nwhether  EPA  breached  a  subsequent  contractual  promise  in  the  early  phase  of  contract \nperformance. \nAlthough § 200.340 provides bases for termination and obligates an agency to include \nthose bases in grant agreements, the regulation does not (a) mandate what grant termination \nprovisions must or must not say, or (b) limit an agency’s ability to terminate a grant to those bases \nagreed to in a grant agreement.  To the extent EPA’s termination of Plaintiffs’ Grant Agreements \nbased upon program goals and agency priorities was contrary to the Grant Agreements’ termination \nprovision, that may be a breach of the agreements, but it is not a violation of the plain language of \n§ 200.340.  In other words, if EPA did not specifically incorporate § 200.340(a)(4) into the Grant \nAgreements, that is a contract issue, not a regulatory one.  \nEPA’s termination of the grants does not implicate 2 C.F.R. § 200.342 either, because EPA \ndid not terminate for Plaintiffs’ noncompliance.  Thus, the regulation’s requirement that a grantee \nfacing an agency’s remedy for noncompliance be provided the opportunity to object is not \napplicable here and cannot form the basis of an APA claim.  Even if § 200.342 had applied, any \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 35 of 41\n \nfailure to provide an opportunity to object would be harmless error, because, as described above, \nEPA’s bases for termination were the grants’ structure and terms, including the changes to those \nterms made in the twilight of the prior administration, and not conduct of Plaintiffs for which they \ncould use the opportunity to object to explain or justify.   \niii.  EPA’s Suspension, Prior to Termination, Did Not Violate the APA.  \nThough mooted by the subsequent termination, EPA’s direction to Citibank to freeze \ndisbursements to the GGRF grantees did not violate the APA.  Only final agency action, as opposed \nto “preliminary, procedural, or intermediate” agency actions, is reviewable under the APA. 5 \nU.S.C. § 704.  The pause placed on Plaintiffs’ Citibank accounts was a precautionary measure to \nensure that funds were not transferred or disbursed as EPA continued its review of the $20 billion \nprogram.  See EPA TRO Opp. at 22, citing Pacific Gas & Elec. Co. v. FPC, 506 F.2d 33, 39 & n. \n20, (D.C. Cir. 1974), Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997), and Sackett v. E.P.A., 566 \nU.S. 120, 127 (2012) (A decision reflects the “consummation” of the agency decision making \nprocess when that decision is subject to no further agency review).  Because the temporary hold \non the Citibank accounts was not final agency action, it is not reviewable under the APA.  \nEven it was, the suspension was reasonable for many of the same reasons that termination \nwas reasonable:  the GGRF program’s unusual features, post-election amendments, and ongoing \nDOJ, FBI and EPA OIG investigations.  See EPA TRO Opp. at 9 and 21.   \nIV.  Plaintiffs’ Alleged Harm Cannot Justify a Preliminary Injunction.  \nAn injunction should be denied when Plaintiffs’ alleged harms are monetary and may be \nremedied by damages.  \nA.  Plaintiffs’ Alleged Harm is Not Irreparable.  \nThe D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 36 of 41\n \nChurches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  “Where the injuries alleged are purely \nfinancial or economic, the barrier to proving irreparable injury is higher still, for it is ‘well settled \nthat economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable harm.’”  Mexichem Spec. Resins, \nInc. v. E.P.A., 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, \n674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  “The Supreme Court has echoed this message, finding that ‘the temporary \nloss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury.’”  Davis \nv. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1295 (D.C. Cir. 2009). (citing Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974)).   \nIn terminating Plaintiffs’ grants, EPA has not prohibited or made it unlawful for Plaintiffs \n(or their subgrantees) to carry out their work.  Nor has any other government action.  The \ngovernment is not preventing Plaintiffs from providing services; EPA has just terminated the \ncontracts under which the government would provide reimbursement for those services. See e.g., \nFaculty Senate of Fla. Int’l Univ. v. Winn, 477 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1208 (S.D. Fla. 2007) (“There is \nno irreparable harm here because the plaintiffs can fund the desired travel themselves and then, if \nthey prevail in this suit, obtain reimbursement. In other words, the harm is financial.”).  The only \nharm to Plaintiffs’ mission here is not getting paid under the terms of the agreements.  That is \ninsufficient for injunctive relief.   \nFurther, “Plaintiffs must show that irreparable harm is likely, not merely possible.”  In re \nTelexFree Sec. Litig., No. 4:14-md-002566-TSH, 2021 WL 11604879, at *7 (D. Mass. Apr. 21, \n2021) (citing Steir v. Girl Scouts of the USA, 383 F.3d 7, 16 (1st Cir. 2004)).  That showing “must \nbe grounded on something more than conjecture, surmise, or a party’s unsubstantiated fears of \nwhat the future may have in store.”  Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d \n151, 162 (1st Cir. 2004).  Plaintiffs’ brief and declarations are full of speculative language, pointing \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 37 of 41\n \nthe Court to harms that “may”—but have not and might not—occur.   \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Alleged Harm is Not Immediate.  \nPlaintiffs’ claimed immediate injury—delayed disbursement of funds—would be remedied \nat the conclusion of this case (or a case brought in the Court of Federal Claims) if they are \nmeritorious.  And Plaintiffs’ inability to collect money unless and until they prevail on the merits \nis a standard part of litigation that does not justify a preliminary injunction.  “The rule that equitable \nremedies cannot issue when the damages are monetary in nature has been ingrained in law for ‘half \na millennium or so,’ and no judge within the English common law tradition has the luxury of \nignoring it.” United States v. Michigan, 230 F.R.D. 492, 495 n.1 (E.D. Mich. 2005).  This is true \neven where a plaintiff claims that it does not have ready reserves or charitable donors or that \nwaiting for money is harmful because of a lack of other funds.  See id. (movant failed to show \nirreparable harm beyond monetary damages even though “[movant] argue[d] that its ratepayers \nare low-income and do not have the luxury of saying, ‘It’s only money.’”); see also., Dennis \nMelancon, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 703 F.3d 262, 279 (5th Cir. 2012) (the “possibility that \nadequate compensatory or other corrective relief will be available at a later date, in the ordinary \ncourse of litigation, [weighs] heavily against a claim of irreparable harm”) (citation omitted).   \nThe risks Plaintiffs primarily expound upon are all financial—like the possibility of missed \npayments, inability to cover expenses, and paused disbursements to subgrantees. While Plaintiffs’ \nattempt to emphasize the depth and breadth of the work they have begun under the GGRF program, \nthe impact of terminating that work may be exaggerated.  This litigation comes at the beginning \nof the GGRF’s programmatic work.  Plaintiffs’ GGRF funding was obligated just a little over six \nmonths ago.  Many of Plaintiffs’ employees are recent hires or have not yet been hired at all. See \nPI Motion at 52; Bafford Decl. ¶7 (Climate United created as a separate legal entity in 2022). \nPlaintiffs’ projects are not years in the making.  And to the extent the work of Plaintiffs, their \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 38 of 41\n \nvarious coalition partners, or their subgrantees predate the GGRF program, that longevity suggests \nthat their work can survive a pause in funding as this litigation continues or the termination of \nPlaintiffs’ grants should Plaintiffs’ challenge prove unsuccessful.  \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Alleged  Reputational  Harm  Fails  to  Justify  Entry  of  a  Preliminary \nInjunction. \nPlaintiffs’ alleged reputational harm boils down to anticipated difficulties in attracting \ninvestors and partners.  Any anticipatory difficulties arising from the reduction of Plaintiffs’ budget \nis “‘strictly economic’ and therefore not irreparable ... [and] the discontinuance of funds did not \ninjure [Plaintiffs’] reputation because it reflected no more than a decision based on reasons of \npolicy.”  Planned Parenthood Ass’n of Utah v. Schweiker, 700 F.2d 710, 718 n.16 (noting the \ndiscontinuance of Title X funding was not sufficient to justify preliminary injunction).  The loss \nof potential investment stemming from EPA’s efforts to impose oversight and control over the grant \nfunds is an economic loss, which does not constitute irreparable harm.  Ahuruonye v. U.S. Dep’t of \nInterior, 312 F. Supp. 3d 1, 24 (D.D.C. 2018).  The anticipated reputational injuries are also \nhypothetical and do not justify preliminary injunction “especially when [the alleged injuries are] \nnothing more than speculation about how third parties might respond.”  John Doe Co. v. Consumer \nFin. Prot. Bureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1134 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  “As with all other forms of irreparable \nharm,  the  showing  of  reputational  harm  must  be  concrete  and  corroborated,  not  merely \nspeculative.”  Trudeau v. Fed. Trade Com’n, 384 F.Supp.2d 281, 297 (D.D.C. 2005); see also \nAhuruonye, 312 F. Supp. 3d at 24 (quoting Trudeau).  \nV.  An Injunction Would Be Contrary to the Public Interest. \nAs detailed in the EPA Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a TRO, the balance \nof equities and public interest continue to weigh against the extraordinary remedy of a preliminary \ninjunction.  See EPA TRO Opp. at 24-26.  “[T]he protection of the public fisc is a matter that is of \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 39 of 41\n \ninterest to every citizen,” Brock v. Pierce Cnty., 476 U.S. 253, 262 (1986).  Granting Plaintiffs’ \nrequested relief here puts a significant portion of the public fisc out of the government’s protection.   \nThe public interest is also not served by “reinstating” a Grant Agreement that would force \nEPA into a multiple year, $20 billon spending obligation, which it has no ability to unilaterally \nterminate without allegedly violating the APA.  Adopting Plaintiffs’ reasoning would have grave \nconsequences on procurement, healthcare, and any arena in which the federal government plays a \nrole. Taken to its logical conclusion, Plaintiffs’ theory would bind the Executive to perform \ncontracts, even if the agreements no longer serve any public purpose, or instead run counter to the \npublic interest. The need to protect against such circumstances demonstrates why Congress \nadopted a limited waiver of sovereign immunity under the Tucker Act. The public interest is served \nby furthering the Tucker Act’s policy choice, not by evading it. \nVI.  Any Relief Should be Limited. \nFor the reasons explained above, Plaintiffs are not entitled to any preliminary injunctive \nrelief.  But in the event the Court concludes otherwise, injunctive relief “must be narrowly \ntailored to remedy the specific harm shown,” Neb. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHealth & Hum. Servs., 435 F.3d 326, 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted), and “should be no \nmore burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” \nMadsen v. Women’s Health Ctr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted).  The scope of \nany relief granted here should not extend beyond the Court’s Temporary Restraining Order, see \nECF No. 28, especially considering the significant risk that any monies disbursed to Plaintiffs’ \nmay not be recoverable.  Any granted relief should also be (1) limited to the specific agency \naction Plaintiffs’ challenge—the Termination Letter—not any other conduct whose lawfulness is \nnot before this Court, see Nat’l Ass’n of Chain Drug Stores v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 40 of 41\n \nServs., 631 F. Supp. 2d 17, 21 (D.D.C. 2009); and (2) limited to the Plaintiffs’ alone who have \nshown imminent and irreparable harm.  \nVII.  Bond is Required if the Court Issues a Preliminary Injunction. \nIf the Court decides to grant any preliminary injunctive relief, the Court should order \nsecurity with any preliminary injunction.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), the \nCourt may issue a preliminary injunction “only if the movant gives security” for “costs and \ndamages sustained” by Defendants if they are later found to “have been wrongfully enjoined.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 66(c).  Although this Rule provides “broad discretion in the district court to \ndetermine the appropriate amount of an injunction bond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d \n21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), when setting security, courts “should err on the high side” because \nsetting a bond amount too low might produce injury since “the damages for an erroneous \npreliminary injunction cannot exceed the amount of the bond.” Mead Johnson & Co. v. Abbott \nLabs., 201 F.3d 883, 888 (7th Cir. 2000).  Should the Court issue an injunction at this \npreliminary stage that exceeds the scope of the temporary restraining order and allows Plaintiffs \nto draw down on the Citibank accounts, the Courts must require Plaintiffs to post a bond.   \nCONCLUSION \nEPA respectfully requests that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n   \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 49     Filed 03/26/25     Page 41 of 41\n \nDated: March 26, 2025  Respectfully Submitted, \n   \nYAAKOV ROTH  \nActing Assistant Attorney General  \n \nKIRK T.

R. Civ. P. 65 and LCvR 65.1(a), Plaintiffs Climate United Fund, Coalition \nfor Green Capital, and Power Forward Communities, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”), hereby move to extend \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 52     Filed 03/28/25     Page 2 of 4\nthe Temporary Restraining Order entered by this Court on March 18, 2025 (Dkt. 29)1 for an \nadditional fourteen days from its presumptively scheduled expiration date of April 1, 2025. An \nextension is necessary to preserve the status quo pending the determination of Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction, which will be fully briefed tonight and is set to be heard on April 2, 2025. \nOn March 26, 2025, Plaintiffs requested that Defendants consent to an extension of the \nTRO for an additional fourteen days to allow the Court time to consider the preliminary injunction \nmotion. On March 27, counsel for the EPA Defendants responded that “for the reasons set forth in \nour TRO opp., and now our PI opp., we continue to maintain that the Court lacks jurisdiction and \nthat Plaintiffs have not met the legal standard necessary to obtain TRO relief. Thus, we cannot \nagree to any extension of the TRO.” Counsel for Defendant Citibank advised later that day that it \n“defers to the Government with regard to [the extension], and therefore takes no position,” even \nthough there is plainly diversity jurisdiction as to Citibank. \nARGUMENT \nThis Court should extend the TRO to April 15, 2025. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2) provides that \na TRO issued without notice expires no later than fourteen days after its entry, “unless before that \ntime the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer \nextension.” Although the Rule is “silent on the timeline for temporary restraining orders entered \nwith notice,” as is the case here, “it is generally accepted that the standard fourteen days followed \nby a fourteen-day extension for good cause applies to a TRO entered with notice as well.” \nDellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 615122, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 26, 2025) (citing Wright & Miller, 11A \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2953)).  \n \n1 At the time the Court entered the TRO, the cases had not yet been consolidated, but identical \norders were entered in Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, N.A., et al., No. 25-cv-735, Dkt. 16, \nand Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank, N.A., et al., No. 25-cv-762, Dkt. 15. For the \navoidance of doubt, the instant motion seeks an extension of all three orders. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 52     Filed 03/28/25     Page 3 of 4\nGood cause exists to extend the TRO for a further fourteen days. “Although there is little \ncase law on what constitutes ‘good cause,’ ‘a showing that the grounds for originally granting the \n[TRO] continue to exist’ is sufficient.” Costa v. Bazron, 2020 WL 2410502, at *2 (D.D.C. May \n11, 2020) (quoting 11A Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2953); Clevinger v. \nAdvocacy Holdings, Inc., 2023 WL 4535467, at *2 (D.D.C. June 20, 2023) (“Good cause to extend \na TRO can be established . . . when an extension will prevent further irreparable harm from \naccruing while the moving party presents a motion for a preliminary injunction.”). Good cause \nmay also be established where “the Court needs time to consider [a] forthcoming motion for a \npreliminary injunction.” Costa, 2020 WL 2410502, at *3. \nAny of these grounds constitutes good cause for extending the TRO in these cases for an \nadditional fourteen days. As the Court held in its memorandum opinion granting Plaintiffs’ \nmotions for a TRO in part, “preserving the status quo here is particularly important. If Citibank \ntransfers money out of these accounts, the funds will not be recoverable. . . . Any transfer, re-\nallocation, or re-obligation of these funds would be an irreparable loss.” Dkt. 28 at 19. That \nconcern persists, and the EPA Defendants have given Plaintiffs no reason to think they would not \ndirect Citibank to transfer the money out of the accounts if the TRO were lifted. The extension \nwill also provide the Court with the time it needs to consider Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction \nmotion. In its present posture, the TRO would presumptively expire before the Court is set to even \nhear argument on that motion, which would run counter to the Court’s intent, expressed in its order, \nthat the EPA Defendants and Citibank be enjoined from giving effect to the Termination Letters \n“pending a determination on the merits” and that Citibank be enjoined from moving or transferring \ngrant funds to any party other than the accountholders “absent an Order from this court.” Dkt. 29 \nat 2. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 52     Filed 03/28/25     Page 4 of 4\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should enter an order in substantially the form attached \nto this motion, extending its Temporary Restraining Order for an additional fourteen days, until \nApril 15, 2025, unless it is superseded by the entry of a preliminary injunction prior to that date. \nDated: March 28, 2025    Respectfully submitted:  \n/s/ Vincent Levy      /s/ Adam G.

Regulations, statutes, and even the Constitution \nare no obstacle, EPA contends, because there are contracts between EPA and Plaintiffs, so any \ndispute between them must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims.  \nThat is wrong. “Unlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant programs originate \nin and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of Congress concerning \ndesirable public policy.” Dkt. 28 at 11 (quoting Bennett v. Ky. Dep’t of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, 669 \n(1985)). Thus, federal courts must “fulfill their obligations under the APA to independently \nidentify and respect [any] delegations of authority, police the outer statutory boundaries of those \ndelegations, and ensure that agencies exercise their discretion consistent with the APA.” Loper \nBright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 403-04 (2024).1 \nEPA fares no better on the merits. Tellingly, after a blitz of statements in the press and on \nsocial media, and after issuing official documents with accusations of fraud and waste causing \ngreat  injury  to  Plaintiffs,  EPA  now  says  that  “EPA  did  not  terminate  for  Plaintiffs’ \nnoncompliance.” Dkt. 49 at 25. This remarkable concession means that the grounds for termination \nset forth in the Notices were not only disparaging, but known by EPA to be false.  \nNow, EPA hangs its hat on the claim that “applicable regulations allow an agency to \nterminate for consideration of its priorities.” Id. at 2. But they do not. OMB amended the applicable \nregulations in April 2024, effective October 2024, to eliminate the ability to terminate federal \n \n1\n Case citations and quotations are “cleaned up” unless otherwise specified. \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 11 of 41\ngrants due to changed agency priorities except when expressly permitted in the grant award. OMB \nsuggested that federal agencies may wish to implement that change before October 2024. And that \nis what EPA did here—it determined in July 2024, months before the last election, that it would \napply the new OMB directive to all new grants, including Plaintiffs’ NCIF grants. That history, \napparently forgotten by EPA, also disproves EPA’s repeated claim that “Plaintiffs’ agreements \noriginally” permitted termination due to changes in agency priorities, “but subsequent post-\nelection and post-award amendments stripped away the agency’s right.” Dkt. 49 at 2, 4-5, 12-13, \n14,  23,  26.  Plaintiffs’  original  awards  in  August  2024  expressly  cited  EPA’s  July  2024 \ndetermination to apply OMB’s new regulations immediately. Applicability Date for the Office of \nManagement and Budget’s Regulatory Revisions, 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, 55,263 (July 3, 2024).  \nBeyond that, EPA violated federal law multiple times over. It violated its obligation to \nprovide a reasoned explanation for its decision. It violated its regulations governing when and how \na grant may be terminated. It violated federal statutes by trying to eviscerate a program approved \nby Congress and seeking, without authority, to claw back already-disbursed funds. And it violated \nthe Constitution, including the Appropriations Clause, the separation of powers, and due process. \nFor its part, Citibank makes no effort to justify its conduct under the agreements it signed \nwith Plaintiffs and their subgrantees, the Account Control Agreements (or ACAs). Instead, \nCitibank claims it was directed to act as it did by its principal, the U.S. Department of the Treasury. \nThat is no excuse. Citibank does not dispute that settled New York law (which governs the ACAs, \nCU Ex. 8 at 5) instructs that a person who signs a contract is subject to liability for breaching it \neven if that person acts at the direction of a principal. And Citibank’s assertions that the ACAs \nmust be read in harmony with the Financial Agency Agreement (FAA) that it signed with Treasury \n(not Plaintiffs) do not move the needle: Plaintiffs are not parties to the FAA and so cannot be \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 12 of 41\nbound by it, and in any event the ACAs are clear on their face that Citibank’s obligations with \nregard to the funds are exclusively set forth in the ACAs. \nThe Court should enter a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs have demonstrated several \nforms  of  irreparable  harm,  including  potentially  fatal  disruption  to  Plaintiffs’  operations; \nirreplaceable loss of clients, partnerships, and opportunities; devastating reputational injury; \ninterference with Plaintiffs’ missions; and an immediate risk of insolvency for some of the \nPlaintiffs and their subgrantees. Many of these injuries have already materialized and will worsen \nif Plaintiffs continue to be deprived of access to their funds. Compounding these injuries are \nreputational harms from EPA’s accusations against Plaintiffs and from the legal and financial \nuncertainties created by EPA and Citibank. On the other side of the ledger, Plaintiffs ask only that \nDefendants be compelled to act in accordance with the law, a request that is in the public interest. \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction Over All Claims Against EPA. \nA.  The Tucker Act Does Not Impliedly Preempt Plaintiffs’ APA Claims. \nAlthough this Court has already held that it has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ claims \nfor violations of the APA, regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, EPA continues to insist \notherwise. EPA leads by sponsoring the breathtaking theory that, so long as a plaintiff has a \ncontractual relationship with the government, it may violate its own regulations, federal statutes, \nand the Constitution—and may act entirely arbitrarily—because the plaintiff might have a contract \nclaim in the Court of Federal Claims. See Dkt. 49 at 10-12. This proposition, if accepted, would \nunsettle the bedrock principle that courts must “set aside any [agency] action inconsistent with the \nlaw as they interpret it.” Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 391-92. \nThe D.C. Circuit has rejected a far narrower proposition than what EPA asserts, “explicitly \nreject[ing]” what it called “the ‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring some reference to or \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 13 of 41\nincorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly within the Tucker \nAct’ because to do so would ‘deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on \ngrounds other than a contractual relationship with the government.’” Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. \nGen.  Servs.  Admin.,  38  F.4th  1099,  1107  (D.C.  Cir.  2022).  Instead,  Circuit  law  calls  for \nconsideration of “both … the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and … \nthe type of relief sought (or appropriate).” Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1982). Under these factors, the Court should reaffirm its jurisdictional ruling that Plaintiffs may \npress their claims here. \n1.  Plaintiffs’  Rights  Arise  From  Regulations,  Statutes,  and  the \nConstitution. \nTo begin, the complaints and preliminary-injunction motion made clear that the source of \nrights for Plaintiffs’ claims comes from regulations, statutes, and the Constitution. Despite that, \nEPA still contends that “[t]here is no source for Plaintiffs’ asserted rights other than their claim of \nthe contractual right to perform under the grants they were awarded.” Dkt. 49 at 11.  \nBut that is not so. EPA points out that one of Plaintiffs’ claims concerns a federal \nregulation, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, that in turn refers to the terms and conditions of federal grants. \nDkt. 49 at 9-13. But although the determination of whether EPA violated Section 200.340 requires \nlooking at the terms and conditions—because, as further explained below, the regulation permits \nEPA to terminate grants only on grounds outlined in the terms and conditions—this does not turn \nthe claim into a contract claim. See Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. And Plaintiffs’ many other claims \nalleging violations of federal law leave no doubt as to Plaintiffs’ claimed source of rights. Plaintiffs \nclaim a right to be free from arbitrary government action under the APA (a statute), a right to be \ntreated consistent with regulations, a right to have their grants respected in accordance with \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 14 of 41\nCongress’s mandate, and a right to receive notice and to be heard under the Due Process Clause. \nNone of that comes from the terms and conditions of any contract.  \nDriving home that this is not a garden-variety breach-of-contract case, EPA is not even \nrelying on the terms of the grants to justify termination. CU Ex. 11 at 1; EPA Br. 12-13. Rather, \nits asserted programmatic considerations led EPA to issue an across-the-board termination of all \nNCIF grants using essentially identical Notices of Termination. That decision violates EPA’s own \nregulations, federal statutes, and the U.S. Constitution; the claim thus belongs in this Court.  \nNone of EPA’s cases are to the contrary. EPA cites Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, \n780 F.2d 74 (D.C. Cir. 1985), for the proposition that a plaintiff may not “recharacterize breach of \ncontract claims as APA claims,” Dkt. 49 at 10, but the case is inapposite. There, the government \ncancelled a contract for air compressors. That injury canonically should be remedied by contract \ndamages, and the D.C. Circuit rejected Ingersoll’s attempt to avoid that conclusion by framing its \ncase as requesting equitable relief rescinding the termination. But here it is not possible, as it was \nin Ingersoll-Rand, to “conceive of this dispute as entirely contained within the terms of the \ncontract,” 780 F.2d at 78, because the government has already performed its end of the bargain by \nobligating and disbursing the funds to Plaintiffs. Accordingly, Plaintiffs’ claims are not that EPA \nhas breached the Grant Agreements, but rather that EPA has acted contrary to law in attempting to \nclaw back those already-disbursed funds. The right upon which Plaintiffs base their claims is the \nright to be free of unlawful agency action, and the “source[s] of th[at] right” are the APA, a federal \nstatute, the Constitution, and EPA’s own regulations. See Dkt. 33-1 at 22-23; Dkt. 28 at 12. \nSpectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891 (D.C. Cir. 1985), also cited by \nEPA, is similarly inapt. There, the plaintiff-contractor failed to perform on a contract awarded by \nGSA to develop a data communications network to be used by the VA, and GSA withheld payment \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 15 of 41\nby invoking the liquidated damages provision in the contract, returning the contractor’s unpaid \ninvoices. See id. at 892. The contractor sought “an injunction compelling the GSA to cease \nwithholding” the $1.8 million it had invoiced. Id. at 892 & n.1. The D.C. Circuit understandably \nconcluded that a request for an injunction compelling GSA to pay invoices was simply a disguised \nclaim for money damages. See id. at 894-95. \nThere is nothing like that here. EPA has already disbursed all the funds to Plaintiffs. The \nquestion is whether EPA may claw these funds back consistent with federal regulations, statutes, \nand the Constitution. As the D.C. Circuit has explained, district courts have jurisdiction in \n“property disputes arising from contractual relationships” to adjudicate claims that government \nactors “acted beyond the scope of their statutory authority.” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969. And \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction to consider claims “in the nature of tort” even when the “claim \npresuppose[d] the existence of a contract.” Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108, 1110. \nEPA also relies on U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops v. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL \n763738, at *5 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025). See Dkt. 49 at 15. That case remains inapposite for the \nreasons  Plaintiffs  already  explained,  including  because  Plaintiffs  here  are  not  asking  the \ngovernment to pay money “past due” (rather, all parties agree that the money is already disbursed). \nSee Dkt. 33-1 at 24-25. EPA has nothing to say beyond the observation that the plaintiffs in \nCatholic Bishops cited one of the regulations Plaintiffs invoke here, but, as explained supra at 4 \nand infra at 13-16, that regulation does not make this a contract case.2  \n \n2 Catholic Bishops is an outlier among recent district-court decisions. Compare 2025 WL 763738, \nat *5-7, with, e.g., Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Teacher Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 863319, at *2-5 \n(D. Md. Mar. 19, 2025); AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coal. v. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 752378, at *8 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025); Mass. v. Nat’l Insts. of Health, 2025 WL 702163, at *7-8 (D. Mass. Mar. \n5, 2025); Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 655075, at *5-6, *16-17 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025). \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 16 of 41\nFinally, the D.C. Circuit’s instructions in Megapulse (and since) sink EPA’s extreme view \nthat there can be no judicial review here because the government supposedly has an “inherent \ncontractual right to breach” like any other private party. Dkt. 49 at 13. EPA is not just a contracting \ncounterparty here, but also a regulator, and the Executive, unlike private parties, has regulatory, \nstatutory, and constitutional obligations that constrain its range of action vis-à-vis private parties. \nAs this Court recognized, “[u]nlike normal contractual undertakings, federal grant programs \noriginate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of Congress \nconcerning desirable public policy.” Dkt. 28 at 11 (quoting Bennett, 470 U.S. at 669). Thus, EPA’s \nassertion that there is a contractual relationship between the parties does not come close to \novercoming  the  “well-settled”  and  “strong  presumption”  favoring  “judicial  review  of \nadministrative action.” Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, 229 (2020).3  \n2.  Plaintiffs Do Not Seek Damages or “Specific Performance.” \nTurning to the second Megapulse factor, Plaintiffs are not seeking damages or specific \nperformance  of  a  contract.  They  are  seeking  injunctive  relief  mandating  compliance  with \nregulations, statutes, and the Constitution, and enjoining EPA from interfering with Plaintiffs’ \nproperty and grants in violation of federal law. As this Court recognized, “any monetary benefit \nthat might flow to Plaintiffs ‘would not come from this court’s exercise of jurisdiction, but from \n \n3 EPA’s remaining authority is farther afield. Justice Scalia’s concurrence in United States v. \nWinstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839, 919-20 (1996), does not stand for the proposition, Dkt. 49 at 15-16, \nthat the Executive has an inviolable right to breach contracts. Boaz Housing Authority v. United \nStates  did  not  hold  that  where  “the  government  has  implemented  its  grant  programs  by \n‘employ[ing] contracts’ … the proper recourse for any asserted violation of those grant terms is ‘a \nsuit in the Claims Court for damages,’” Dkt. 49 at 16, but rather that “depending upon the terms \nof the contract and the circumstances of non-payment, the government may find itself subject to \nsuit in the Claims Court for damages[.]” 994 F.3d 1359, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Horwitz-Matthews, \nInc. v. City of Chicago, 78 F.3d 1248, 1250-51 (7th Cir. 1996), addressed the Contracts Clause. \nAnd Benderson Dev. Co. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 998 F.2d 959, 962 (Fed. Cir. 1993), is irrelevant \nbecause, as stated therein, “the Postal Service, in contradistinction to other federal entities, may \nsue and be sued on contract claims in courts other than the Court of Federal Claims.” \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 17 of 41\nthe structure of statutory and regulatory requirements governing compensation’ in this action.” \nDkt. 28 at 12 (quoting Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 174 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nThe distinction between money damages and specific remedies, even monetary relief, is \nsettled. Dkt. 28 at 12. “Damages” provide “compensatory relief” to “substitute for a suffered loss,” \nas opposed to “specific remedies,” which “are not substitute remedies at all, but attempt to give \nthe plaintiff the very thing to which he was entitled.” Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 895 \n(1988) (quoting Md. Dep’t of Human Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, \n1446 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  \nPlaintiffs are not seeking damages. EPA disbursed the funds to Plaintiffs, and the funds \nbelong to Plaintiffs and their subgrantees, and may be used by them in accordance with the awards. \nEPA does not own the funds anymore, although it retained a security interest as a secured party. \nCU Ex. 8 at 1. Plaintiffs wish to enjoin EPA’s effort to interfere and to claw back these funds. In \nno sense are Plaintiffs seeking “a substitute for that which has been lost” (i.e., damages); they are \nseeking an order “restor[ing] to the plaintiff[s] that to which [they] w[ere] entitled from the \nbeginning,” before EPA began to act unlawfully. Am.’s Cmty. Bankers v. FDIC, 200 F.3d 822, 829 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000).  \nEPA claims Bowen is inapposite because, “[h]ere, the monetary relief is not merely some \ndownstream consequence of vacating agency action like a regulation or order—the action that \nPlaintiffs directly challenge is itself contractual in nature (the termination of the grants).” Dkt. 49 \nat 14. Those are just words without substance. There is no meaningful distinction between Bowen \nand this case. There, the Secretary of HHS “disallowed” Medicaid reimbursement payments to the \nstate of Massachusetts in a specific amount based on an interpretation of the Medicaid Act and \napplicable regulations. See 487 U.S. at 885-87. When Massachusetts sued in district court, the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 18 of 41\ndistrict court did what district courts do every day—interpret federal law—and reversed the \ndisallowance. See id. at 888. Thus, the entitlement to monetary relief in Bowen was not just some \nincidental “downstream consequence of vacating agency action”; it was the sole purpose of the \nlawsuit, and followed directly from a vacatur of the agency’s action. \nSimilarly, EPA’s repeated assertion that Plaintiffs seek “the classic contractual remedy of \nspecific performance,” see Dkt. 49 at 2, 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, does not make it so. Again, Plaintiffs \nseek an injunction restoring the status quo before EPA’s campaign of illegal actions beginning \nwith the freeze of Plaintiffs’ funds and culminating in the purported terminations. Plaintiffs do not \nseek “a remedy that would deny EPA any right to end the parties’ agreements[.]” Dkt. 49 at 12. \nThey seek to halt an illegal effort to claw back funds that belong to them, a declaration that EPA’s \nactions exceeded its regulatory, statutory, and constitutional authority, and an order nullifying \nthose actions to that extent. See Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893-94. That Plaintiffs would be permitted to \ndraw down funds as a result of the vacatur of unlawful agency action does not take the case out of \nthis Court’s jurisdiction. Maryland, 763 F.2d at 1446-48.  \n3.  Plaintiffs Do Not Challenge Unreviewable Funding Decisions. \nEPA separately argues that judicial review is foreclosed by 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) because \nPlaintiffs are really challenging funding decisions committed to agency discretion by law. Dkt. 49 \nat 16-17. This argument ignores settled precedent and mischaracterizes Plaintiffs’ claims. \nFirst, APA review is unavailable only “in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in \nsuch broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply.” Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, \nInc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Califano \nv. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99 (1977). But “judicial review is available where there are ‘meaningful \nstandards to cabin the agency’s otherwise plenary discretion,’” Physicians for Soc. Resp. v. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 19 of 41\nWheeler, 956 F.3d 634, 643 (D.C. Cir. 2020), and it is settled that “judicially manageable standards \nmay be found in formal and informal policy statements and regulations as well as in statutes,” id.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs are not challenging EPA’s funding decision or its design of a competitive \ngrant program. The program competition, mandated by Congress, occurred back in 2024, and the \nfunds were all obligated by Congress’s deadline (September 2024), and then disbursed. Plaintiffs \nare challenging EPA’s subsequent freezing of Plaintiffs’ funds, the purported termination of all \nNCIF awards, and EPA’s effort to claw back the funds. There is law to apply to those claims—the \nAPA, federal regulations, federal statutes, and the Constitution.  \nLincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), EPA’s principal authority, is inapt. It concerned a \nchallenge to “[t]he allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation” that carried with it “a \ncongressional recognition that [the] agency must be allowed flexibility to shift funds within a \nparticular appropriation account so that the agency can make necessary adjustments for unforeseen \ndevelopments and changing requirements.” Id. at 192-93. Here, the disbursement occurred and is \nnot being challenged. Plaintiffs challenge EPA’s effort to unwind it and to claw back funds. \nB.  Plaintiffs May Alternatively Invoke This Court’s Equitable Jurisdiction. \nIn the alternative, as Plaintiffs explained, the Court may also enjoin federal officials from \nacting contrary to federal law under its equitable jurisdiction. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., \nInc., 575 U.S. 320 (2015); see Dkt. 33-1 at 25-26 (collecting cases). EPA has virtually no response \nto this established precedent. See Dkt. 49 at 21 n.10. \nEPA appears to believe that the enactment of the APA and of the Tucker Act implicitly \nstripped federal courts of this longstanding jurisdictional authority. EPA cites Alexander v. \nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275 (2001), apparently for the proposition that the Court should not imply a \nright of action. But the ability to seek an injunction against unlawful government action has been \nrecognized by the Supreme Court and “trac[es] back to England.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327; see, \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 20 of 41\ne.g., Osborn v. Bank of United States, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 738 (1824); Carroll v. Safford, 44 U.S. \n(3 How.) 441 (1845). Such an established basis of jurisdiction will not be displaced “absent the \nclearest command.” McQuiggin v. Perkins, 569 U.S. 383, 397 (2013) (citation omitted). Neither \nthe APA nor the Tucker Act contain that requisite clear statement. Instead, the D.C. Circuit has \ninstructed, “[n]othing in the subsequent enactment of the APA altered” courts’ ability to restrain \nfederal officials under this line of authority. Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d 217, 224 (D.C. Cir. \n1988) (citation omitted). \nII.  The Court Should Issue a Preliminary Injunction Barring EPA From Terminating \nPlaintiffs’ Grants or Impeding Citibank From Disbursing Grant Funds. \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Claims for Violations of Federal Law. \n1.  EPA Violated the Prohibition on Arbitrary and Capricious Action. \n“Congress in 1946 enacted the APA ‘as a check upon administrators whose zeal might \notherwise have carried them to excesses not contemplated in legislation creating their offices.’” \nLoper Bright, 603 U.S. at 391 (citation omitted). As Plaintiffs explained, EPA’s termination was \narbitrary and capricious because it: (i) contained only a formulaic explanation without factual \nsupport; (ii) relied on authority that did not apply, and (iii) invoked unsubstantiated rationales, \nincluding a supposed need to improve oversight, that do not provide legal authority for termination. \nDkt. 33-1 at 27-31.  \nIn response, EPA abandons much of the rationale it gave in the Notices of Termination, \nand does not dispute many of the points stated in Plaintiffs’ brief. At the outset, EPA does not \ndispute that it is insufficient to “merely parrot[] the language of” regulations, as EPA did here, \nbecause it “explains nothing about why the agency” acted as it did. Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, \n753 F.3d 1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Dkt. 33-1 at 27. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 21 of 41\nEPA also does not dispute that, although the Notices referred to 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339 and \n340, and vaguely cited concerns of “waste, fraud, and abuse,” it provided no substantiation to \nsatisfy the APA’s reasoned-explanation requirement. This Court already recognized that these \n“vague[] reference[s]” to “programmatic waste, fraud, and abuse and conflicts of interest” were \n“insufficient.” Dkt. 28 at 16. It is perhaps for this reason—EPA’s lack of any evidence to support \nthese accusations—that EPA no longer presses these claims. Indeed, EPA’s new admission that it \n“did not terminate for Plaintiffs’ noncompliance,” Dkt. 49 at 25 (emphasis added), confirms that \nEPA’s invocation of “waste, fraud, and abuse” was arbitrary and pretextual. \nAnd so, unable to defend its reasoning in the Notices of Termination, EPA says only that \nthe  terminations  were  lawful  because  “[u]nder  the  new  administration,  new  EPA  officials \nprudently reviewed EPA’s spending” and “determined that the level of oversight provided in \nPlaintiffs’ Grant Agreements was exceedingly insufficient.” Dkt. 49 at 22-23. This is inadequate. \nTo begin, this is not a permissible ground for termination under the regulations invoked by \nEPA in the Notices of Termination. See Dkt 33-1 at 32-33; infra at 15-16. Moreover, EPA also \nfailed “to supply a reasoned analysis for the change” in position. Sierra Club v. Salazar, 177 F. \nSupp. 3d 512, 532-33 (D.D.C. 2016); Dkt. 33-1 at 30-31. As EPA’s own cases establish, a change \nin priorities does not negate the APA. A new administration may “reapprais[e] [] the costs and \nbenefits of its programs and regulations,” but it “may not choose not to enforce laws of which it \ndoes not approve, or to ignore statutory standards in carrying out its regulatory functions.” Motor \nVehicles Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 59 & n.* (1983) \n(emphasis added) (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part) (cited at Dkt. 49 at 22).  \nLikewise, it is not enough that EPA “display awareness that it is changing position”; an \nagency “must” provide “a more detailed justification than what would suffice for a new policy \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 22 of 41\ncreated on a blank slate” when, as here, “its new policy rests upon factual findings that contradict \nthose which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior policy has engendered serious reliance \ninterests.” FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515-16 (2009) (some emphasis \nadded) (cited at Dkt. 49 at 24); see also Dkt. 33-1 at 30-31 (explaining reliance interests). EPA’s \nposition that it could terminate any grant program in its entirety simply because of the “agency’s \npriorities,” Dkt. 49 at 2, would arrogate extraordinary power to the Executive and abrogate decades \nof jurisprudence. \nOf course, the Notices provide no reasoned explanation for the about-face, although in \nbriefing EPA claims that running the program out of EPA directly, rather than through Citibank, \nwould improve oversight and efficiency. Dkt. 49 at 23. This is an improper post-hoc justification. \nVinyl Inst., Inc. v. EPA, 106 F.4th 1118, 1126 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quoting SEC v. Chenery Corp., \n318 U.S. 80, 88 (1943)). Agencies do not get “the benefit of additional time” to “provide[] a \nsecond, supplemental” rationale for their decisions. Dkt. 49 at 7 n.6 (describing second Amidon \ndeclaration as exactly that). Regardless, the explanation is inadequate. The ASAP system does not \nallow EPA to review or approve draws, and the arrangement with Citibank offers EPA enhanced \noversight—providing EPA with real-time insight into all funds of prime and subgrantees and \nprogram income (neither of which is available under ASAP). Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 31-33.  \nFinally, EPA gets nowhere by citing December 2024 amendments to the grant awards \nrelated  to  2  C.F.R.  § 200.340,  see  Dkt.  49  at  23—amendments  the  agency  blatantly \nmischaracterizes as eleventh-hour changes designed to impede the new administration’s policy \nagenda. In April 2024, OMB amended the sole regulation cited by EPA here, 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, \nto permit termination of federal grants when inconsistent with agency priorities only when that \nbasis is stated in the grant’s terms and conditions, 89 Fed. Reg. 30,046, 30,089 (Apr. 22, 2024). \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 23 of 41\nThe new regulation was made effective in October 2024, but OMB stated that “Federal agencies \nmay also elect to apply the final guidance to their Federal awards issued prior to October 1, 2024.” \nId. at 30,049. Consistent with OMB’s changes, in July 2024, EPA announced that “EPA ha[d] \ndecided to apply the revised version of 2 CFR 200.340 to EPA financial assistance agreements \nawarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024.” See 89 Fed. Reg. at 55,263. And EPA \ndid so in the case of Plaintiffs’ NCIF grants. See CU Ex. 3 at 41 (“EPA maintains the right to \nterminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in 2 CFR 200.339 and the version of 2 CFR \n200.340” applicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 FR 55,262).  \nThis was months before the election. And the December 2024 amendment did not change \nthat aspect of the termination provision; it merely reflected a technical change to refer to the new \nregulations (2 C.F.R. § 200.340 effective as of October 1, 2024) in lieu of EPA’s determination to \napply the new regulation effective in July 2024 (89 Fed. Reg. 55,262): \n \nIn sum, EPA has repeatedly failed to provide an explanation for terminating Plaintiffs’ \ngrants beyond the most basic claim that EPA, under a new administration, considers its supervision \nover the program to be “insufficient.” Dkt. 49 at 23. There is a “significant mismatch between the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 24 of 41\ndecision [EPA] made and the rationale [it] provided.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n783 (2019). And although EPA continues to insist that it “has not abandoned the GGRF program,” \nDkt. 49 at 23 n.11, Administrator Zeldin’s public comments make clear that EPA plans otherwise, \nDkt. 33-1 at 29-30. Plainly, EPA “had made up [its] mind” to cancel the GGRF grants already, \n“and did so for reasons … unrelated to” its stated rationales, in violation of the APA. Dep’t of \nCom., 588 U.S. at 783. \n2.  EPA’s Notices of Termination Violate Federal Regulations. \nAs Plaintiffs explained, EPA’s purported terminations did not comply with applicable \nfederal  regulations.  Dkt.  33-1  at  32-34.  Specifically,  Plaintiffs  showed  that  the  Notices  of \nTermination failed to comply with the prerequisites for termination under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339 and \n400, were devoid of the “reasons for termination” required by 2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a), and deprived \nPlaintiffs of the “opportunity to object” mandated by 2 C.F.R. § 200.342.  \nEPA’s answer is most notable for what it does not say—i.e., it does not assert that it \ncomplied with 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.341(a) or 342, or that the agency’s purported termination is \npermissible under 2 C.F.R. § 200.339. Section 200.339 permits an agency to terminate a federal \ngrant  where  the  recipient  “fail[ed]  to  comply  with  the  U.S.  Constitution,  Federal  statutes, \nregulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal award,” and such “noncompliance cannot be \nremedied by imposing specific conditions.” Yet, although EPA expressly relied on this provision \nin the Notices of Termination, Section 200.339 now appears nowhere in the agency’s justification. \nWhy not? Because, as EPA concedes for the first time in its opposition when forced to defend its \nconclusory termination, “EPA did not terminate for Plaintiffs’ noncompliance.” Dkt. 49 at 25.  \nRegardless, the Notices of Termination also violate the sole regulatory provision EPA now \ncites: 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). Per EPA, this regulation “does not … limit an agency’s ability to \nterminate a grant to those bases agreed to in a grant agreement.” Dkt. 49 at 25. But as stated above, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 25 of 41\nEPA is dead wrong; that is exactly what Section 200.340(a)(4) does. It provides that an “award \nmay be terminated … [b]y the Federal agency … pursuant to the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities.” Id. (emphasis added). The text is unambiguous: EPA can \nterminate on the grounds that the program “no longer effectuates the program goals or agency \npriorities” only if that basis is stated in the grant agreement. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 30089 (“Provided \nthat the language is included in the terms and condition of the award, the revised termination \nprovision at section 200.340 continues to allow Federal agencies … to terminate an award [based \non the award no longer effectuating program goals or agency priorities].” (emphasis added)). The \naward here does not include this basis.  \nPerhaps recognizing this problem, EPA tries a different tack, claiming that its original \nagreement with Plaintiffs included a different set of terms of conditions which, in EPA’s telling, \nwould have allowed the agency to terminate the awards on policy grounds. That argument is both \nbeside the point (that prior version does not apply here) and misleading. True, EPA’s prior General \nTerms and Conditions contained the language EPA wishes were applicable here. But as explained, \nsupra at 13-14, when EPA executed the award agreements in August 2024, it had already \nannounced that it would “apply the revised version of 2 CFR § 200.340 to EPA financial assistance \nagreements awarded or amended to add funds on or after July 1, 2024.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 55,263. \nThus, far from being a “change[] to th[e] terms made in the twilight of the prior administration,” \nDkt. 49 at 26, EPA contemplated from the outset that Plaintiffs’ awards would be governed by the \ncurrent version of 2 CFR § 200.340(a)(4)—a regulatory requirement EPA violated here. \n3.  EPA’s Notices of Termination Violate the Inflation Reduction Act. \nThere is no dispute that EPA, in administering the NCIF competitive process and obligating \nPlaintiffs’ awards before September 30, 2024, adhered to the IRA’s statutory mandate. See Dkt. 49 \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 26 of 41\nat 19 (“EPA satisfied the requirements of the statute” by “timely” obligating Plaintiffs’ funds). \nYet, EPA contends, its decision to cancel that program and claw back Plaintiffs’ grant funds is \nsomehow also consistent with the statute and simply “part of [EPA’s] GGRF program operation.” \nId. That is wrong—and perplexing. EPA’s decision to terminate all NCIF grants “‘based on \nreasons of policy,” id. at 29, and program “structure,” id. at 17, plainly violates the IRA’s directive \nthat EPA obligate grant funds to “nonprofit organizations,” no later than September 30, 2024, “for \nthe rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(c)(1); see In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (“[T]he President may not \ndecline to follow a statutory mandate … simply because of policy objections.”). \nTo be sure, in the limited circumstances where EPA may unilaterally terminate Plaintiffs’ \nGrant Agreements (none of which applies here), the Grant Agreements recognize that EPA may \nde-obligate “uncommitted funds and re-obligate them.” CU Ex. 3 at 41. But consistent with the \nIRA’s statutory requirements, the agency “must … re-obligate [those funds] to another Eligible \nRecipient selected under Funding Opportunity Number 66.957 (NCIF) to effectuate the objectives \nof Section 134 of the Clean Air Act.” Id. (emphasis added); accord id. at 51-52. Here, however, \nEPA has purported to terminate the awards of all Eligible Recipients selected under the NCIF \nNOFO, effectively cancelling the program. It has no statutory authority to do so—nor to create an \nentirely new grant program after the IRA’s September 30, 2024 deadline. \n4.  EPA’s Suspension of the Grants Violates the APA. \nEPA’s suspension of Plaintiffs’ awards before terminating them independently violated \nregulations and the Constitution in multiple ways. Dkt. 33-1 at 35-36. EPA’s only answer is that \nthe suspension was merely a “precautionary,” “temporary hold” that did not constitute final agency \naction reviewable under the APA. Dkt. 49 at 26. But as courts have recognized, even temporary \nsuspensions of grants “produce legal consequences.” E.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 27 of 41\n2025 WL 368852, at *10-11 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (OMB Memorandum instructing agencies to \n“temporarily pause all activities related to the obligation or disbursement of all Federal financial \nassistance … led to legal consequences and constituted final agency action.” (emphasis omitted)); \nIpsen Biopharm., Inc. v. Azar, 943 F.3d 953, 959 (D.C. Cir. 2019). That is the definition of “final \nagency action” under the APA, as EPA’s own cited cases confirm. See Dkt. 49 at 26.  \nAnd  EPA’s  suspension  of  the  awards  represented  a  “culmination”  of  the  agency’s \ndecisionmaking; EPA’s decision was plainly made already by February 14, as it relied on the same \nbaseless claims of insufficient oversight, waste, and abuse in the February 13, 2025 press release4 \nas it did in the Notices of Termination, see Dkt. 13-1. See XP Vehicles, Inc. v. Dep’t of Energy, \n118 F. Supp. 3d 38, 61 (D.D.C. 2015) (informal agency action final when it “provide[d] no \nindication” that the agency’s decision was “at all tentative or open to any further reconsideration”). \nEPA also suggests that its termination notice has “mooted” Plaintiffs’ suspension-related \narguments. Dkt. 49 at 26. Yet in the same breath, EPA continues to defend the suspension’s \npropriety, arguing that it “was reasonable for many of the same reasons that termination was \nreasonable.” Id. Accordingly, to prevent EPA from relying on its illegal suspension even if the \nillegal termination is enjoined, the Court should enjoin both. See Dkt. 33-1 at 35. \nB.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Appropriations Clause Claims. \nEPA has no good answer to Plaintiffs’ Appropriation Clause claims. \nTo begin, EPA’s standing argument is meritless. The Supreme Court’s decision in Hein v. \nFreedom from Religion Foundation, which reaffirms that taxpayers generally have no right to \nchallenge  the  constitutionality  of  government  expenditures,  is  irrelevant  here.  Plaintiffs  are \nrecipients of federal grants who challenge EPA’s purported termination of those grants (and \n \n4 Press Release, EPA, Administrator Zeldin Announces that Billions of Dollars Worth of “Gold \nBars” Have Been Located at Outside Financial Institution (Feb. 13, 2025). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 28 of 41\neffective cancellation of the grant program) on the ground that EPA’s conduct violates Congress’s \ndirective about how to spend money. See Dkt. 33-1 at 40. Such a suit hardly suggests that “every \nfederal taxpayer could sue to challenge any Government expenditure.” Hein v. Freedom from \nReligion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 593 (2007). \nNor is EPA correct that only actions “to halt the Executive from disbursing funding” are \ncognizable under the Appropriations Clause. See Dkt. 49 at 18-19. As the Supreme Court has long \nrecognized, “the [Appropriations] Clause has a more fundamental and comprehensive purpose”—\nnamely, to “assure that public funds will be spent according to the letter of the difficult judgments \nreached by Congress as to the common good, and not according to the individual favor of \nGovernment agents.” OPM v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 427-28 (1990) (emphasis added).  \nIn other words, the Appropriations Clause and separation-of-powers principles forbid the \nExecutive from unilaterally declining to expend funds Congress appropriated. Id.; see In re Aiken \nCnty., 725 F.3d at 261 n.1 (“With respect to the suggestion that the President has a constitutional \npower to decline to spend appropriated funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad \npower is supported by neither reason nor precedent.” (citation omitted)). EPA’s decision to \nterminate a federal grant program it concedes was established in accordance with Congress’s \ndirectives, Dkt. 49  at 18, 19, is hardly the stuff of “‘normal and orderly operation of the \ngovernment,” id. at 19 (quoting City of New Haven v. United States, 809 F.2d 900, 907 (D.C. Cir. \n1987)). EPA’s own authority recognizes as much. See City of New Haven, 809 F.2d at 908 \n(impoundments “designed to negate congressional budgetary policies” are precisely those which \ndo not reflect the “normal and orderly operation of government”).  \nAiken and Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35 (1975), are thus right on point. For one \nthing, like this case, “[t]hose cases concerned policy disagreements with Congress,” Dkt. 49 at 18. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 29 of 41\nSee id. at 29; infra (outlining evidence of the current Administration’s policy disagreement with \nthe IRA’s GGRF). For another, Aiken and Train recognize that the Executive may not refuse to \ndisburse funds that were appropriated but not yet obligated or disbursed. That prohibition applies \na fortiori here, where the Executive seeks to claw back funds that were obligated and disbursed. \nEPA’s pledge in the Notices to “work to re-obligate lawfully appropriated funds” does not \nchange matters. For starters, and for the many reasons Plaintiffs outlined, Dkt. 33-1 at 35, there is \nample reason to doubt that EPA will re-obligate NCIF funds as Congress directed. (And it cannot \ndo so under the Grant Agreements, having assertedly terminated all NCIF awards. Supra at 17.) \nFrom President Trump’s Executive Order issued his first day in office directing all federal agencies \nto “immediately” suspend IRA funds, see PFC Compl. ¶ 6, to the OMB memoranda repeating \nPresident Trump’s order to terminate the so-called “Green New Deal,” id., to Administrator \nZeldin’s many public statements disparaging the GGRF and NCIF programs, Dkt. 33-1 at 35, “the \nrecord  here  shows  that  Defendants  are  acting  to  rescind  or  defer  the  funds  Congress  has \nappropriated and have no intent to spend them.” AIDS Vaccine, 2025 WL 752378, at *15.  \nIn any event, any effort to re-obligate the billions of dollars Congress appropriated for the \nGGRF based on EPA’s new policy priorities would amount to the agency effecting a new grant \nprogram after the September 30, 2024 deadline. See 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)-(3). Such action would \ndirectly contravene the intent of Congress and thereby violate the Appropriations Clause. \nC.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Due Process Claims. \nEPA does not dispute that Plaintiffs were provided no process whatsoever before the \nagency froze, and then sought to terminate, their NCIF awards. Nor does EPA dispute Plaintiffs’ \ndescription, see Dkt. 33-1 at 43, of the extraordinary sequence of events preceding the purported \ntermination. Instead, EPA contends that despite that disturbing lack of process, Plaintiffs’ due \nprocess claims fail as they “are nothing more than another set of contract claims.” Dkt. 49 at 21.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 30 of 41\nEPA is wrong. Again, this is not a contract dispute governed by the Tucker Act. See supra \nat 3-11. EPA’s own cases, see Dkt. 49 at 21, acknowledge “that a district court has jurisdiction to \nhear a due process claim” when “an underlying set of circumstances gives rise to both a contract \nclaim and an independent Constitutional claim.” Olympic Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass’n v. Dir., Off. of \nThrift Supervision, 1990 WL 134841, at *9 (D.D.C. Sept. 6, 1990).  \nEPA cites Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc. v. United States, 271 F.3d 1060 (Fed. Cir. \n2001), for the proposition that a “party whose rights derive from a federal contract cannot maintain \na separate claim based upon a property interest.” Dkt. 49 at 20. But Plaintiffs’ rights do not derive \nonly from a federal contract, see supra at 4-7, and Hughes’s facts are inapposite. Hughes involved \na party that sought to assert a takings claim in addition to a breach of contract claim, but its takings \nclaim was ultimately addressed only to a demand for prejudgment interest on its contract damages, \na theory of “property” that rose and fell with the contract dispute. See 271 F.3d at 1070. Here, \nPlaintiffs assert procedural due process and APA claims against EPA, not takings or contract \nclaims. And unlike in Hughes, the agreements expressly vest Plaintiffs with property interests. See \nDkt. 33-1 at 41-42 (citing, e.g., CU Ex. 8 ¶ 1(c) (describing grantees as “entitlement holder[s] with \nrespect to all financial assets”) and CU Ex. 3 at 56 (authorizing grantees to “legally obligate[]” \ngrant funds “for financial obligations” to third parties)). \nEPA ignores these provisions, relying instead on the Grant Agreements’ list of approved \nuses of grant funds and grant closeout procedures. Dkt. 49 at 20. But the fact that Plaintiffs are \n“required to spend the funds on allowed uses under the grants,” id., and not at their fancy, does not \nmean Plaintiffs have no protected interest in those funds. They do—and they seek to maintain them \nprecisely  for  the  purpose  of  supporting  the  many  “allowable  activities”  that  coincide  with \nPlaintiffs’ public-interest missions, see Dkt. 33-1 at 13-15. EPA’s “perfected security interest” in \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 31 of 41\nthe funds held in Plaintiffs’ accounts, Dkt. 49 at 20, is not to the contrary. That interest is “grant[ed] \n[to] EPA” by the Plaintiffs, CU Ex. 3 at 56, in accordance with New York’s UCC, CU Ex. 8, at 1, \nmaking clear that EPA is a secured party, and not the owner of the funds.5 \nIn any event, the D.C. Circuit has held that even for funds not yet obligated, “[i]f [a] statute \nor implementing regulations place substantive limitations on official discretion to withhold award \n[of the eligibility criteria], there is a legitimate claim of entitlement, as to which the Due Process \nClause affords protection.” NB ex rel. Peacock v. District of Columbia, 794 F.3d 31, 41-42 (D.C. \nCir. 2015). Plaintiffs’ interest here is greater: the funds were awarded, obligated, and disbursed, \nand nothing in the IRA or implementing regulations authorizes EPA to freeze or take back those \nfunds. Plaintiffs plainly have a property interest that may not be taken away without due process. \nD.  Plaintiffs Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent Injunctive Relief Against EPA.  \nEPA’s  actions  have  caused  and  will  continue  to  cause  Plaintiffs  irreparable  harm \nwarranting injunctive relief.  \nEPA claims that the “only harm to Plaintiffs’ mission here is not getting paid under the \nterms of the agreements,” which is “insufficient for injunctive relief.” Dkt. 49 at 27. But as the \nCourt’s TRO decision explains, the D.C. Circuit has held precisely to the contrary: financial harm \ncan “constitute irreparable harm … where the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s \nbusiness.” Dkt. 28 at 19 (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). \nApplying that standard, the Court recognized that “Plaintiffs will be unable to finance programs \n \n5 EPA cites In re Joliet-Will County Community Action Agency, 847 F.2d 430, 432 (7th Cir. 1988) \nfor the proposition that federal grant funds do not become an awardee’s property until they incur \na program cost. That is incorrect. Joliet’s essential holding is that federal grant funds do not \nbecome part of a bankrupt grantee’s estate because the government’s interest is superior to that of \nany unsecured creditor, id. at 433—a proposition not in dispute here. And, unlike here, nothing in \nJoliet suggests that (1) the debtor had a property interest under the award or (2) the funds had been \ndisbursed.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 32 of 41\nthey  have  launched,  and  they  will  have  to  cease  operations.”  Id.  The  Court  cited  detailed \ndeclarations from Climate United and PFC, id. at 19-21, and on this motion, Climate United and \nPFC’s declarations further substantiate the existential risks. Dkt. 33-1 at 44-47, 51-54. EPA ignores \nthis evidence. And it does not attempt to distinguish National Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, which \ngranted a preliminary injunction where “continued funding [was needed] to keep the[] doors \nopen.” 2025 WL 597959, at *18 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025). \nOf course, far less is required for a preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs cited law establishing \nthat the sorts of injury to all three Plaintiffs’ reputation, goodwill, and ability to operate as intended \ncount as irreparable. See e.g., Tex. Children’s Hosp. v. Burwell, 76 F. Supp. 3d 224, 242-44 & n.7 \n(D.D.C. 2014); Nalco Co. v. EPA, 786 F. Supp. 2d 177, 188 (D.D.C. 2011); Mass. Law Reform \nInst. v. Legal Servs. Corp., 581 F. Supp. 1179, 1187-88 (D.D.C. 1984), aff’d, 737 F.2d 1206 (D.C. \nCir. 1984). EPA ignores that law too and claims, without offering any example, that “Plaintiffs’ \nbrief and declarations are full of speculative language[.]” Dkt. 49 at 27. EPA also insists Plaintiffs’ \nharm is insufficiently “immediate.” Id. at 28. But EPA fails to grapple with declarations from all \nthree plaintiffs offering detailed and specific descriptions of harms that are both certain and \nimminent—and irreparable under established law, including the inability to provide continued \nfinancing under existing programs, see Dkt. 33-1 at 45, 48-49, 53; the inability to compensate \nemployees, pay rent, or pay necessary contractors, id. at 45, 52; the inability to vet project \napplications or engage in technical assistance or knowledge-sharing activities, id. at 49; pauses in \nhiring, rescission of job offers, and deferral of compensation, id. at 45, 52-53; and decisions by \npartners to cease engagement with Plaintiffs while the status of their funding is uncertain, id. at \n47, 48-49, 51. In many cases, Plaintiffs have already suffered the injuries EPA claims are \n“speculative.” Dkt. 49 at 27-29; see, e.g., Dkt. 33-1 at 47-48, 51 (all three Plaintiffs have already \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 33 of 41\nexperienced a “chilling effect” in their business relationships and harm to partnerships). \nEPA’s  vague  assertion  that  the  impact  of  terminating  Plaintiffs’  work  “may  be \nexaggerated,” Dkt. 49 at 28, ignores the specific and concrete details in the declarations about the \nwork Plaintiffs and their subgrantees have done so far and the impact of its cancellation. This \nincludes Climate United’s pre-construction financing project for a major solar power project in \nArkansas, a project to purchase and lease battery electric heavy-duty trucks in California, and \nrecently launched awards as part of the Climate United NEXT program. See Dkt. 33-1 at 45; \nBafford Decl. ¶¶ 38-41. It includes CGC’s Network Loan Program to partner with green banks \nacross the country, its Municipal Investment Fund to provide market-building and predevelopment \ngrants and technical assistance for communities across the country, and its programs to provide \ndirect funding to investment projects. See Dkt. 33-1 at 48-49; Brown Decl. ¶¶ 6-11; Buendia Decl. \n¶¶ 5-14; Kauffman Decl. ¶¶ 8-13. And it includes PFC’s and its subgrantees’ programs to provide \nfinancing for affordable housing construction and rehabilitation projects, like the affordable \nhousing projects in Iowa, Michigan, and Virginia that face imminent funding deadlines. See Dkt. \n33-1 at 53; Donovan Decl. ¶¶ 18-22; Moon Decl. ¶¶ 16-23; Matusiak Decl. ¶¶ 19-20. EPA does \nnot acknowledge or address the current impact on these programs, let alone the potential breach \nof agreements Plaintiffs already executed. See, e.g., Bafford Decl. ¶ 70; Brown Decl. ¶¶ 7-8. \nPlaintiffs will also suffer irreparable reputational harm. EPA incants that “the showing of \nreputational harm must be concrete and corroborated, not merely speculative.” Dkt. 49 at 29. True \nenough—but  all  three  plaintiffs  submitted  declarations  with  concrete  and  corroborated \nexplanations of their current and anticipated reputational harm, all of which EPA ignores. See Dkt. \n33-1 at 46-47, 49-52; Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 72-75; Brown Decl. ¶¶ 11-13; Buendia Decl. ¶¶ 15-18; \nKauffman Decl. ¶¶ 18-24; Mayopoulos Decl. ¶¶ 20, 26-27; Matusiak Decl. ¶ 20; Moon Decl. ¶ 30. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 34 of 41\nE.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Favor Plaintiffs Over EPA.  \nEPA  does  not  respond  to  Plaintiffs’  submission  that  the  balance  of  equities  favors \nPlaintiffs. Dkt. 33-1 at 54-55. As for the public interest, EPA asserts a generalized interest in \nprotecting the “public fisc.” Dkt. 49 at 29. But EPA has not shown why the existing safeguards to \nprevent fraud, waste, or abuse under the terms of Plaintiffs’ grants are insufficient, especially \nwhere EPA has conceded that it did not terminate Plaintiffs’ grants for noncompliance. See \nDkt. 33-1  at  55;  Dkt. 49  at  23,  25,  29.  As  this  Court  properly  recognized,  “vague  and \nunsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.” Dkt. 28 at 22. EPA is also wrong to assert that \n“Plaintiffs’ theory would bind the Executive to perform contracts, even if the agreements no longer \nserve any public purpose, or instead run counter to the public interest.” Dkt. 49 at 30. Plaintiffs’ \narguments are tied to the facts of this case: they have substantiated how the grants do serve a public \npurpose (the very one Congress directed) and that EPA acted unlawfully in terminating them. See \nDkt. 33-1 at 13-15, 27-35, 55-56. \nF.  The Court Should Reject EPA’s Request for a Bond.  \nDistrict Courts have “broad discretion … to determine the appropriate amount of an \ninjunction bond” under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d \n21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), “including the discretion to require no bond at all,” P.J.E.S. ex rel. Escobar \nFrancisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d 492, 520 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Simms v. District of Columbia, \n872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012)). In this case, EPA fails to suggest an amount for bond, \ninstead recommending that the court should “err on the high side.” Id.  \nCourts have uniformly exercised their discretion to require no bond or only a nominal bond, \nexplaining that “where the government is alleged to have unlawfully withheld [b]illions of dollars \nof previously committed funds … it would defy logic … to hold Plaintiffs hostage for the resulting \nharm. That is especially so when Defendants … will personally face no monetary injury from the \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 35 of 41\ninjunction.” Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 597959, at *19; see Am. First Legal \nFound. v. Becerra, 2024 WL 3741402, at *16 n.11 (D.D.C. Aug. 9, 2024) (no bond); Bailey v. \nFed. Bureau of Prisons, 2024 WL 3219207, at *13 n.5 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024) (same); Maryland \nv. Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 800216, at *26 (D. Md. Mar. 13, 2025) (requiring nominal $100 \nbond); Does 1-26 v. Musk, 2025 WL 840574, at *32 (D. Md. Mar. 18, 2025) (same). The Court \nshould similarly require either a nominal bond or no bond.6 \nG.  The Injunction Should Permit Plaintiffs and Subgrantees to Access Funds. \nEPA contends that the “scope of any relief granted here should not extend beyond the \nCourt’s Temporary Restraining Order.” Dkt. 49 at 30. But that relief—which would merely keep \nthe funds frozen and still prevent Plaintiffs from getting funds—would not address Plaintiffs’ \nirreparable harm and, for Climate United and PFC, would drive them to financial ruin. The TRO \nwas a temporary freeze to preserve the status quo and prevent imminent harm that could not be \naddressed in a matter of weeks. But now that the issues have been thoroughly aired, the Court \nshould enter an injunction that prevents Plaintiffs from experiencing irreparable harm that cannot \nbe remedied pending the much longer period required to dispose of the merits. \nEPA suggests, without argument, that any injunction should be “limited to the Plaintiffs[ ] \nalone who have shown imminent and irreparable harm.” Dkt. 49 at 30-31. But extending the \ninjunction to the accounts of Plaintiffs’ subgrantees is necessary to provide “complete relief.” \nDistrict of Columbia v. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 49 (D.D.C. 2020) (collecting cases). \nThe NCIF program expressly contemplates that recipients may administer “subawards (in the form \n \n6 Indeed, in this case, EPA’s argument for a bond is particularly weak because the funds are in \nPlaintiffs’ name in a Citibank account, so a preliminary injunction would not require EPA to \nexpend any funds that have not already been disbursed. And EPA’s sole authority that the Court \n“should err on the high side” in setting a bond, Mead Johnson & Co. v. Abbott Labs., 201 F.3d \n883, 888 (7th Cir. 2000), dealt with a commercial dispute between two competing manufacturers \nof infant formula. That fact pattern could not be further from the instant dispute. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 36 of 41\nof subgrants) to carry out a portion of the grant’s activities,” while Plaintiffs remain “accountable \nto EPA for effectively carrying out the full scope of the work and the proper financial management \nof the grant (including subawards to non-lead coalition members).” CU Ex. 1 at 6-7. And Plaintiffs \nhave put forward evidence that their subgrantees’ inability to access funds affects Plaintiffs’ \noperations and ability to carry out their mission. See, e.g., Moon Decl. ¶¶ 16-23; Donovan Decl. \n¶ 24; Matusiak Decl. ¶ 20. If EPA may circumvent an injunction by simply freezing the funds held \nby subrecipients—where Citibank has no legal basis to deny subgrantees access to their accounts \nand EPA has no legal right of control—Plaintiffs will not have received complete relief. \nIII.  The Court Should Issue a Preliminary Injunction Barring Citibank From Failing to \nDisburse Plaintiffs’ Grant Funds Pursuant to the ACAs.  \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on Their Claims Against Citibank. \nCitibank does not seriously dispute that it breached its obligations in the ACAs. The ACAs \nspecify that Citibank “shall comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement orders the \nBank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the Accounts.” CU Ex. 8 at \n2 (emphases added). And they explain that Citibank’s duties are exclusively “administrative or \nministerial,” and that Citibank “shall not be responsible” for determining whether requests for \ngrant funds comply with any contracts or laws. Id. at 3. Citibank breached the ACAs by failing to \ncomply with instructions by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees to disburse funds. Dkt. 33-1 at 56-57. \nCitibank claims that it was required under the FAA to carry out the FBI’s and Treasury’s \npurportedly lawful orders. Dkt. 48 at 12-17. As Plaintiffs have already explained, however, if the \nCourt grants Plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction with respect to EPA, this defense would disappear: \nCitibank cannot claim it is obeying lawful government orders when a court finds those orders \nunlawful. Dkt. 33-1 at 57. Importantly, Citibank has not disputed this basic premise.  \nBut the Court should hold that Citibank breached the ACAs regardless, because the FAA \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 37 of 41\noffers no defense. Citibank does not dispute the settled law that agents are liable for breaching \nagreements they sign in their own name (as here), even if they were directed to breach by a \nprincipal. Citibank asserts only that the FAA and the ACAs are “‘interrelated agreements’ that \nmust be ‘read together … ‘in harmony,’” and that the FAA authorizes Citibank to refuse to perform \nits obligations under the ACAs. Dkt. 48 at 13, 17-18 (citation omitted). That argument fails. \nFirst, Plaintiffs never signed the FAA and are not bound by it. The merger clauses in the \nACAs confirm as much, making clear that the ACAs—which do not even reference the FAA, let \nalone incorporate it—“constitute[] the entire agreement between” each Plaintiff, Citibank, and \nEPA. CU Ex. 8 at 5. Citibank points to the ACAs’ general reference to Citibank’s role “as a \nfinancial agent of the United States,” Dkt. 48 at 5 (quoting Dkt. 14-4 at 1). But that vague reference \ncannot displace the parties’ clear agreement in the integration clause. Meanwhile, “when parties \nset down their agreement in a clear, complete document, their writing should as a rule be enforced \naccording to its terms,” and parties cannot rely on “[e]vidence outside the four corners of the \ndocument as to what was really intended but unstated or misstated.” W.W.W. Assocs., Inc. v. \nGiancontieri, 77 N.Y.2d 157, 162 (N.Y. 1990). \nCitibank  cites  cases  stating  that  “interrelated  agreements”  should  be  interpreted  “in \nharmony,” Dkt. 48 at 13-14. But those cases hold that when the same parties enter into multiple \nwritings regarding a transaction, courts read the separate writings together to discern the true nature \nof their “[a]greement.” Matek Inc. v. IBM, 2024 WL 663340, at *2-3 n.3 (D.D.C. Feb. 16, 2024). \nIn  Matek,  for  example,  IBM  hired  Matek  to  perform  services  for  Howard,  a  transaction \nmemorialized in two agreements that explicitly incorporated one another: one between IBM and \nMatek, and one between IBM, Matek, and Howard, see id. at *1, *3 n.2. When IBM cancelled \nboth contracts and Matek sued, the court sensibly looked to both contracts—including the one \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 38 of 41\ninvolving Howard—to discern the scope of the agreement between IBM and Matek. See id. at *2-\n3. Matek does not hold that a party’s rights under a contract can be limited for “harmony” with a \ncontract to which it is a non-party. Nor do any of Citibank’s other cases.  \nRegardless, the FAA does not permit Citibank’s actions either. The FAA instructs Citibank \nto “comply with all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.” Dkt. 14-1 § 5.B.iv. \nAs Citibank acknowledges, before March 4, when Treasury directly ordered Citibank to cease \ndisbursing  Plaintiffs’  funds,  Citibank  froze  Plaintiffs’  funds  based  solely  on  FBI’s \n“‘recommendation’” that it do so. Dkt. 48 at 7 (quoting Dkt. 14-5 at 1). That “recommendation” \nwas not an “instruction[] or direction[],” and it was not “from Treasury.” Dkt. 14-1 § 5.B.iv. And \nafter March 4, the “instructions” Citibank received from Treasury were not “lawful,” as the FAA \nunambiguously permitted Citibank to freeze accounts only “in accordance with the [ACAs],” \nDkt. 14-1 § 1.B.4. And here, of course, the freezes did not comply with the ACAs. To the extent \nCitibank argues that this latter instruction is inconsistent with its own obligations as a fiduciary of \nthe United States, Citibank’s own cases recognize that the “specific language” of the ACAs must \n“prevail  over  [their]  more  general  language”  referencing  Citibank’s  fiduciary  duty.  Kelso \nEnterprises Ltd. v. A.P. Moller-Maersk, 375 F. App’x 48, 49 (2d Cir. 2010). \nFinally, Citibank cannot rely on the exculpatory clause’s reference to “any act of any \ngovernmental authority.” Dkt. 14-1 § 6(b); Dkt. 48 at 16-17. That clause cannot be read to allow \nCitibank to reject Plaintiffs’ control over their funds at the mere suggestion of EPA; to do so would \nrender meaningless the ACA’s careful provisions regarding the import, form and content of a \nNotice of Exclusive Control. Id. § 2, Ex. A; Nomura Home Equity Loan, Inc. v. Nomura Credit & \nCap., Inc., 30 N.Y.3d 572, 581 (2017) (when interpreting exculpation clause, reiterating rule that \n“a contract must be construed in a manner which gives effect to each and every part”). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 39 of 41\nB.  The Other Preliminary Injunction Factors Favor Plaintiffs. \nCitibank  nowhere  disputes  that  the  remaining  preliminary  injunction  factors  favor \nPlaintiffs. Nor could it. Plaintiffs will undoubtedly suffer irreparable harm if Citibank is not \nenjoined from continuing to refuse to disburse Plaintiffs’ funds to them. See supra at 22-24. Indeed, \nit is settled that where “the subject of the action involves a specific fund,” an inability to access \nthose funds is irreparable. See Destiny USA Holdings, LLC v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts. Realty Corp., \n69 A.D.3d 212, 217 (N.Y. App. Div., 4th Dep’t 2009); Dkt. 33-1 at 46. \nC.  Citibank’s Request for a Stay or Dismissal Is Improper, and the Principles of \nDerivative Sovereign Immunity It Invokes Are Inapposite. \nFinally, Citibank argues that, if the Court were to hold “that it lacks jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’ claims,” then Citibank would “be entitled to derivative sovereign immunity.” Dkt. 48 at \n17-18. In that hypothetical, Citibank says the Court should either “stay litigation against Citibank” \nor “dismiss” the action against Citibank entirely. Dkt. 48 at 17-19.  \n“Derivative sovereign immunity” does not apply here because Citibank has “exceeded its \nauthority.” Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 167 (2016). Further, the doctrine is “less \nembracive than the immunity a sovereign enjoys.” In re OPM Data Sec. Breach Litig., 928 F.3d \n42, 68-69 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (emphasis added). Citibank claims an immunity that is far broader than \nEPA’s immunity. EPA does not claim it is immune from suit in all forums, only that Plaintiffs’ \nclaims must be heard in the Court of Federal Claims. But as Citibank points out, it cannot be sued \nin that court. Dkt. 48 at 18-19. Thus, under Citibank’s theory, it cannot be sued anywhere. The \nCourt should not confer on Citibank an immunity drastically broader than EPA’s.  \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction should be granted.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 53     Filed 03/28/25     Page 40 of 41\nDated: March 28, 2025  Respectfully submitted:  \n/s/ Vincent Levy               /s/ Adam G.

(“PFC”), \nrespectively, sued Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \n(“EPA”), EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and EPA Acting Deputy Administrator William Charles \nMcIntosh (collectively, “EPA Defendants”), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against all \nDefendants after EPA unilaterally suspended and then terminated Plaintiffs’ grant awards.2  On \nMarch 11, 2025, EPA Defendants transmitted nearly identical “Notice of Termination” letters to \nPlaintiffs, indicating that EPA was terminating their grants effectively immediately.  See, e.g., \nClimate United, Notice of Grant Termination Letter, ECF No. 13-1. \nThat  same  week,  Plaintiffs  individually  moved  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order \n(“TRO”), seeking to enjoin Citibank from violating its legal and contractual obligations to disburse \ngrant money owed to Plaintiffs, to enjoin Citibank from transferring Plaintiffs’ grant funds out of \ntheir accounts, to enjoin all Defendants from giving effect to EPA Defendants’ Termination Letter, \nand  to  enjoin  EPA  Defendants  from  taking  action  to,  among  other  things,  implement  the \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ grant awards.  On March 12, and March 17, 2025, the court held hearings \non the motions.  Mar. 12, 2025 Min. Order; Mar. 16, 2025 Min. Order. \n \n \n \n1 On March 17, 2025, Plaintiff Climate United filed an Amended Complaint.  Climate United Am. \nCompl., ECF No. 24. \n \n2 Under the National Clean Investment Fund, Plaintiffs were awarded funding to finance clean \ntechnology projects nationwide—Climate United was awarded $6.97 billion, CGC was awarded \n$5 billion, and PFC was awarded $2 billion.  Pls.’ Consolidated Mot. for Prelim. Inj. at 1, 6, ECF \nNo. 33-1.  Plaintiffs contend that their grant terminations were unlawful.  See id. at 1–4. \nPage 2 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 57     Filed 03/31/25     Page 3 of 5\nOn March 18, 2025, the court entered a TRO enjoining: \n•  EPA  Defendants  and  Citibank  from  giving  effect  to  EPA  Defendants’ \nTermination Letter, pending a determination on the merits. \n•  EPA  Defendants  from  transmitting  or  taking  action  to  implement  the \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ grants, including taking action that results in the \ntransfer, re-obligation, or re-allocation of the grant funds in Plaintiffs’ Citibank \naccounts, or issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control under its agreements. \n•  Defendant Citibank from moving or transferring Plaintiffs’ grant funds to any \nparty other than the accountholders, absent an Order from this court. \n \nMar. 18, 2025, Order (“TRO Order”) at 2, ECF No. 29 (cleaned up). \n \nThe court also ordered the parties to “meet and confer regarding further proceedings, \nincluding any proposed briefing schedule” and to submit a “joint status report with the parties’ \npositions by Wednesday, March 19, 2025, at 2PM EST.”  Id.  The parties agreed to the following \nschedule: \n•  Plaintiffs to file their motions for preliminary injunctions by Friday, March 21. \n•  Defendants to answer the motions by Wednesday, March 26. \n•  Plaintiffs to reply by Friday, March 28. \n•  The Court to hold a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motions on April 1 or April 2. \n \nMar. 19, 2025, Jt. Status Rep. at 2, ECF No. 30. \n \n  The court adopted the parties’ proposed schedule and set the preliminary injunction hearing \nfor April 2, 2025.  Mar. 19, 2025 Min. Order.  As noticed at the March 17, 2025 hearing, the court \nconsolidated case 25-cv-698 (Climate United v. Citibank, et al.) with 25-cv-762 (Power Forward \nCommunities, Inc. v. Citibank, et al.) and 25-cv-735 (Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, et \nal.).  Mar. 20, 2025 Min. Order.3 \n \n3 On March 25, 2025, the court further consolidated case 25-cv-820 (California Infrastructure and \nEconomic Development Bank, et al. v. Citibank, et al.) with this case.  The parties all agreed to or \ndid not object to consolidation.  Mar. 21, 2025, Jt. Status Rep. in 25-cv-820, ECF No. 10. \nPage 3 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 57     Filed 03/31/25     Page 4 of 5\nOn March 28, 2025, Plaintiffs moved to extend the existing temporary restraining order.  \nPls.’ Consol. Mot. to Extend TRO, (“Extend TRO Mot.”), ECF No. 52.  Because the court entered \nthe TRO on March 18, 2025, Plaintiffs move to extend the TRO “for an additional fourteen days \nfrom its presumptively scheduled expiration date of April 1, 2025.”  Id. at 2.  Plaintiffs state that \n“[a]n extension is necessary to preserve the status quo pending the determination of Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction,” which is now fully briefed, “and is set to be heard on April 2, \n2025.”  Id. \nPlaintiffs asked for Defendants’ consent, to which EPA Defendants responded that they \n“continue to maintain that the Court lacks jurisdiction and that Plaintiffs have not met the legal \nstandard necessary to obtain TRO relief.”  Id.  Citibank stated that it defers to the government and \ntakes no position.  Id. \nUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2), a temporary restraining order without \nnotice is valid for a period “not to exceed 14 days . . . unless before that time the court, for good \ncause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(b)(2) (emphasis added).  But, as Plaintiffs note, the Rule is silent on the timeline for \nTROs entered with notice, as is the case here.  Extend TRO Mot. at 2. \n“Although there does not seem to be any case law on what constitutes ‘good cause’ for \npurposes of extending a Rule 65(b) order, a showing that the grounds for originally granting the \ntemporary restraining order continue to exist should be sufficient.”  11A Wright & Miller, 11A \nFed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. § 2953.  Courts have also found good cause where “the Court needs time \nto consider [a] forthcoming motion for a preliminary injunction.”  Costa v. Bazron, No. 19-cv-\n3185 (RDM), 2020 WL 2410502, at *3 (D.D.C. May 11, 2020). \nPage 4 of 5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 57     Filed 03/31/25     Page 5 of 5\nThe court finds that a brief extension is appropriate here for several reasons.  First, good \ncause exists for the same reasons justifying the TRO in the first place.  See Mem. Op., ECF No. \n28 at 13–23.  Second, the court adopted the parties’ proposed schedule for a preliminary injunction \nhearing, and Defendants agreed to a hearing on April 2, 2025.  The preliminary injunction motion \nis fully briefed, and the hearing is now two days away.  The court plans to hear Defendants’ \njurisdictional arguments and rule expeditiously on the preliminary injunction motion.  Third, the \ncourt is extending the TRO by only a few days—seven, not fourteen—while it hears and rules on \nthe parties’ arguments. \nIn consideration of these circumstances, the court finds there is good cause to extend the \nTRO.  The court therefore GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Consolidated Motion to Extend the Temporary \nRestraining Order for seven days until Tuesday, April 8, 2025.  The TRO entered on March 18, \n2025, ECF No. 29, remains in full force and effect. \n \nSO ORDERED. \nDate: March 31, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan \nTANYA S.

(“PFC”) are nonprofit financial institutions who, in April \n2024, were awarded grant funding by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to \nfinance  clean  technology  projects  nationwide.    Under  the  National  Clean  Investment  Fund \n(“NCIF”), Climate United was awarded $6.97 billion, CGC was awarded $5 billion, and PFC was \nawarded $2 billion.  The grant requires that Plaintiffs’ funds be held at Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) \nunder the parties’ respective agreements. \nOn March 8, March 12, and March 14, 2025, Climate United, CGC, and PFC, respectively, \nsued Citibank, and EPA, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, and EPA Acting Deputy Administrator \nWilliam Charles McIntosh (collectively, “EPA Defendants”), seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief after EPA Defendants unilaterally terminated Plaintiffs’ grant awards.1  Plaintiffs bring a \nvariety of claims, including breach of contract, conversion, and replevin against Citibank, claims \nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2), and the Due Process Clause, \nagainst  EPA  Defendants,  claiming  its  actions  violated  multiple  regulations,  statutes,  and \nconstitutional provisions. \nIn  mid-February  2025,  Plaintiffs  attempted  to  draw  on  funds  from  their  respective \naccounts,  to  no  avail.    They  received  little  to  no  communication  from  Citibank  and  EPA \nDefendants regarding their inability to access their funds.  On March 11, 2025, EPA Defendants \ntransmitted nearly identical “Notice of Termination” letters to Plaintiffs, indicating that EPA was \n \n1 On March 17, 2025, Plaintiff Climate United filed an Amended Complaint.

Plaintiff PFC sues on behalf of itself and certain of its award subrecipients.  See Power \nForward, Compl.

Climate United, Notice of Grant Termination \nLetter (“Termination Letter”), ECF No. 13-1; Power Forward, Notice of Grant Termination Letter, \nECF No. 1-10; Coalition Green Capital, Compl. ¶ 13. \nThat  same  week,  Plaintiffs  individually  moved  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order \n(“TRO”), seeking to enjoin Citibank from violating its legal and contractual obligations to disburse \ngrant money owed to Plaintiffs, to enjoin Citibank from transferring Plaintiffs’ grant funds out of \ntheir accounts, to enjoin Defendants from giving effect to EPA Defendants’ Termination Letter, \nand  to  enjoin  EPA  Defendants  from  taking  action  to,  among  other  things,  implement  the \ntermination of Plaintiffs’ grant awards.  On March 12, and March 17, 2025, the court held hearings \non the motions.  See March 12, 2025 Min. Order; see March 16, 2025 Min. Order. \nBased on the parties’ briefing, oral argument, and the record, the court finds that Plaintiffs \nhave carried their burden of showing that they will suffer imminent, irreparable harm absent a \ntemporary restraining order.  It will therefore GRANT Plaintiffs’ motions and enters a temporary \nrestraining order, though more limited in scope than Plaintiffs’ proposed orders. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  EPA Grant Funding – Statutory Background \nIn 2022, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation Reduction \nAct (“Act”).  Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818.  The Act authorized the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction  Fund  (“GGFR”),  which  appropriated  approximately  $27  billion  to  the  EPA \nAdministrator to make grants available to eligible recipients for various climate projects.  See 42 \nU.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)–(3). \nIn 2023, EPA launched three grant competitions under the GGRF, including the $14 billion \nNational Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”) competition, geared at “financ[ing] clean technology \nPage 3 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 4 of 23\ndeployment nationally.”  Climate United Am. Compl. ¶ 80; see Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 1, \nECF No. 2-3.  The purpose of the NCIF was to “provide grants to 2-3 national nonprofit financing \nentities to create national clean financing institutions capable of partnering with the private sector \nto provide accessible, affordable financing for tens of thousands of clean technology projects \nnationwide.”  Climate United, ECF No. 2-3 at 4. \nB.  Climate United, CGC, and PFC Apply for and Win EPA Grants \nIn October 2023, Plaintiffs applied for grant funding through the NCIF, and in April 2024, \nEPA awarded Climate United $6.97 billion, CGC $5 billion, and PFC $2 billion in grant funding.  \nClimate United, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 48; Power Forward, Compl.  ¶¶ 37–38; Coalition Green Capital, \nCompl. ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs developed, and EPA approved, their respective workplans.  Plaintiffs have \nbegun implementing these workplans—some have committed funds to projects, see Climate \nUnited, Compl. ¶ 37 (noting that Climate United has committed $392 million to qualified projects), \nor entered into contracts with third parties, subrecipients, or subgrantees.  See Power Forward, \nCompl. ¶¶ 18–23. \na.  Award Agreements and Relevant Regulations \nPlaintiffs’ grant awards were memorialized in grant agreements between Plaintiffs and \nEPA, which include ‘Terms and Conditions’ governing, among other things, EPA’s termination \nof the award.  Climate United, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 50–59.  The Terms and Conditions specify that EPA \nmay only terminate an award under three circumstances: \n(1) If a grant recipient engages in “substantial” noncompliance such that “effective \nperformance” is “Materially Impaired.”  Performance is deemed “Materially \nImpaired” if: (1) EPA issues a “written determination and finding . . . that the \nRecipient has failed to achieve sufficient progress in accordance with the \nSufficient Progress clause;” and (2) if EPA determines in its sole discretion that \na “corrective action plan” would remedy the issue and EPA issues a “separate \nPage 4 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 5 of 23\nwritten  determination  and  finding”  that  the  Recipient  “has  not  materially \naddressed its failure.” \n(2) If a Recipient engages in “material misrepresentation of eligibility status;” and \n(3) For “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined with reference to EPA General \nTerms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § 200.113.

The court scheduled a hearing on the motion for March 12, 2025.  March 12, \n2025 Min. Order. \n  A day before the scheduled hearing, on March 11, EPA Defendants sent Plaintiffs \nidentical  letters  informing  them  that  EPA  was  terminating  Plaintiffs’  “grant  effective \nimmediately.”  See Termination Letter at 1–2.  EPA Defendants stated that they terminated the \ngrants  “based  on  substantial  concerns  regarding  program  integrity,  the  award  process, \nprogrammatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which \ncollectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.”  Id. at 1.  The \nletters stated that “following a comprehensive review and consistent with multiple ongoing \nindependent federal investigations into programmatic fraud, waste, abuse and conflicts of interest \nEPA has identified material deficiencies,” including “absence of adequate oversight and account \ncontrols,” “improper or speculative allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s oversight and \nPage 8 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 9 of 23\nfiscal  responsibilities,”  and  “circumvention  and  defeat  of  key  oversight  mechanisms  in  the \ndisbursement of federal funds.”  Id.

LEGAL STANDARD \nA temporary restraining order is “an extraordinary remedy that should be granted only \nwhen the party seeking relief, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Hulli v. \nMayorkas, 549 F.

As with a preliminary injunction, a party seeking \na TRO must establish “(1) that he is likely to succeed on the merits, (2) that he is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of equities tips in his \nfavor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Aamer v.

Cir. 2011)).  \nA court also considers the “underlying purpose” of a TRO—“preserving the status quo and \npreventing irreparable harm” until it has an opportunity to rule on the merits.  See Granny Goose \nPage 9 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 10 of 23\nFoods, Inc. v. Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers Loc.

Supp. 350, 352 (D.D.C. 1986) (“In the context of the limited purpose \nof a temporary restraining order, the Court's analysis of these factors seeks principally to ensure \npreservation of the status quo.”). \nIII.  ANALYSIS \nThe court finds that, on the record currently before it, Plaintiffs are entitled to a temporary \nrestraining order. \nA.  Jurisdiction \nFirst, EPA Defendants argue that the court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case because “the \nrelief Plaintiff seeks is entirely contractual in nature” and “really amounts to a breach-of-contract \nclaim.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  According to EPA Defendants, jurisdiction therefore lies in the Court \nof Federal Claims.  At the March 17 hearing, EPA Defendants re-iterated this position for all \nPlaintiffs.  This argument is unavailing. \nUnder the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive \njurisdiction over certain contract and monetary claims against the government.  But the D.C. \nCircuit has “explicitly rejected the ‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring some reference to or \nincorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly within the Tucker \nAct’ because to do so would ‘deny a court jurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on \ngrounds other than a contractual relationship with the government.’”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. \nPage 10 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 11 of 23\nv. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, \n672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). \nIn determining whether a claim falls under the Tucker Act the court must decide if the \naction “is at its essence a contract claim.”  Id. at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967).  The \nD.C. Circuit has instructed that “whether a claim is ‘at its essence’ contractual” depends “both on \nthe source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought \n(or appropriate).”  Id. (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968). \nPlaintiffs’ claims are not at their “essence contractual.”  Plaintiffs sued Citibank and EPA \nDefendants  after  Citibank  refused  to  release  their  grant  funds  and  after  EPA  Defendants \nunilaterally terminated these grants, without giving Plaintiffs any meaningful opportunity to be \nheard.    They  challenge  the  unlawful  terminations  and  EPA’s  failure  to  take  the  necessary \nprocedural steps before terminating the grant awards.  Plaintiffs do not challenge a contract \nbetween the parties—they challenge an action.  And “exclusive jurisdiction in Claims Court under \nthe Tucker Act does not lie ‘merely because [a plaintiff] hints at some interest in a monetary reward \nfrom the federal government or because success on the merits may obligate the United States to \npay the complainant.’”  Id. at 1108 (quoting Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army, 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. Cir. \n1995)).  This court has jurisdiction over the alleged due process and “arbitrary and capricious” \nagency actions under the U.S. Constitution and the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nMoreover, Plaintiffs were awarded this grant pursuant to a statute authorized by Congress.  \nAs  the  Supreme  Court  has  noted,  “[u]nlike  normal  contractual  undertakings,  federal  grant \nprograms originate in and remain governed by statutory provisions expressing the judgment of \nCongress concerning desirable public policy.”  Bennett v. Kentucky Dept. of Educ., 470 U.S. 656, \n669 (1985).  Plaintiffs’ “claims arise under a federal grant program and turn on the interpretation \nPage 11 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 12 of 23\nof statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement negotiated by the \nparties.”  Maryland Dep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1449 \n(D.C. Cir. 1985) (citation omitted).  EPA Defendants’ termination of these grants appears to \ncontravene a duly enacted statute and interferes with Plaintiffs’ statutory rights to these funds. \nAt bottom, Plaintiffs do not bring simple breach of contract claims—they challenge adverse \nagency action.  Plaintiffs neither seek money damages nor ask the court to interpret the terms of \nany contract.  They instead ask the court to determine whether EPA Defendants’ actions in \nterminating the grant were, as EPA Defendants contend, “reasonable and in compliance with \nEPA’s rights under the Grant Agreement.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 15.  A decision on that issue would \nenable Plaintiffs to avail themselves “of statutory and regulatory provisions and procedures that \nmay, or may not, entitle [it] to a monetary recovery.”  Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 175 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (collecting authorities). \nFinally, cases “have long recognized” that “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require \none party to pay money to another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money \ndamages.’”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988).   Indeed, “a claim is not for money \nmerely because its success may lead to pecuniary costs for the government or benefits for the \nplaintiff.”  Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 285; see Vietnam Veterans v. Sec’y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 534 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988).  And as is true here, any monetary benefit that might flow to Plaintiffs “would \nnot come from this court’s exercise of jurisdiction, but from the structure of statutory and \nregulatory requirements governing compensation” in this action.  Tootle, 446 F.3d 167 at 174 \n(citation omitted). \nPage 12 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 13 of 23\nB.  Mootness \nSecond, EPA Defendants argue that the request for a temporary restraining order is now \nmoot because “EPA terminated the Grant, [] ending Plaintiff’s performance and its right to request \ndisbursement of funds.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 13.  The court disagrees. 2 \nArticle III of the U.S. Constitution requires a case or controversy to remain live “at all \nstages of review.”  Decker v. Nw. Env’t Def. Ctr., 568 U.S. 597 (2013) (quoting United States v. \nJuv. Male, 564 U.S. 932, 963 (2011)).  “[A] case is moot when the issues presented are no longer \n‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.”  Powell v. McCormack, 395 \nU.S. 486, 496 (1969).  A case is also moot “if the dispute ‘is no longer embedded in any actual \ncontroversy about the plaintiffs’ particular legal rights.’”  Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, \n91 (2013) (quoting Alvarez v. Smith, 558 U.S. 87, 93 (2009)). \nBased on the parties’ arguments and the record, the court finds that there is a live \ncontroversy, and Plaintiffs’ claims are not moot.  The fact that EPA Defendants have done one of \nthe things that Plaintiffs sought to enjoin—unilaterally terminated their grants—does not mean the \ncontroversy no longer exists.  In fact, there is perhaps even more of a controversy over Plaintiffs’ \nparticular legal rights here.  As discussed above, and at the very least, there are serious due process \nconcerns and questions of whether EPA Defendants’ actions were “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse \nof discretion, [] otherwise not in accordance with law,” contrary to statute, or unsupported by \nsubstantial evidence in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n \n2 While EPA Defendants did not address mootness at the March 17 hearing, the court addresses \nthe argument and addresses it as to all Plaintiffs. \nPage 13 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 14 of 23\nC.  Temporary Restraining Order \na.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nPlaintiffs  challenge,  among  other  things,  EPA  Defendants’  actions  as  arbitrary  and \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law under the APA, and \nviolation of their due process rights.  In its Climate United opposition, EPA Defendants counter \nthat its termination of the grant was “eminently reasonable—not arbitrary and capricious,” and \n“the only responsible course in the interim [] to suspend further grant disbursements that might \notherwise be unrecoverable.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 21.  But based on the record before the court, and \nunder the relevant statutes and various agreements, it does not appear that EPA Defendants took \nthe legally required steps necessary to terminate these grants, such that its actions were arbitrary \nand capricious.  And when questioned at the March 12 hearing, and as discussed further below, \nEPA Defendants proffered no evidence to support their basis for the sudden terminations, or that \nthey  followed  the  proper  procedures.3    Consequently,  Plaintiffs  have  shown  a  substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits of their APA and due process claims.   \nThe Terms and Conditions governing the grant award expressly limit EPA to three possible \ngrounds for termination: “when [1] the noncompliance with the terms and conditions is substantial \nsuch that effective performance of the Assistance Agreement is Materially Impaired or [2] there is \nadequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse or [3] material misrepresentation of eligibility \n \n3 TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. 21:06–22 (March 12, 2025), ECF No. 22 (cleaned up): MR. SACKS: And, \nagain, the termination, to my knowledge, is based on what’s set forth in the [] letter.  THE COURT: \nTell me, can you proffer to me the evidence of commission of a violation of federal criminal law \ninvolving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations? Any one of those things? MR. \nSACKS: I cannot, Your Honor. And I think the reason I cannot is because this Court is not in a \nposition to rule upon whether or not this termination was consistent with the contracts. THE \nCOURT: That’s why you can’t provide it to me or you don’t have it? MR. SACKS: No, I don’t \nhave it. Yeah, I don’t have it.” \nPage 14 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 15 of 23\nstatus[.]”  Climate United, TRO Mot. Ex. 3 at 41, ECF No. 2-5.  The termination letter states that \nthe termination was pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.339 and § 200.340 and “based on substantial \nconcerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, \nand misalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental \ngoals and statutory objectives of the award.”  Termination Letter at 1.   \nEPA’s General Terms and Conditions allow for unilateral termination of an award, which \nshall be “consistent with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.”  See Amidon Decl. ¶ 27.  Under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, \na grant may be terminated if a recipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award, \nid. § 200.340(a)(1), or pursuant to the terms and conditions of the award, including to the extent \nauthorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities, id. \n§ 200.340(a)(4) (emphasis added). \nBut as explained, see supra Section I(B)(a), EPA must take certain procedural steps before \nit can terminate a federal award.  It must provide written notice of a grant termination, 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.341, and it must “provide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information \nchallenging  the action” and comply  “with  any requirements for hearings, appeals,  or other \nadministrative proceedings to which the recipient or subrecipient is entitled under any statute or \nregulation applicable to the action involved,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.342. \nThough EPA Defendants provided written notice, they did not comply with 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.342 and allow Plaintiffs “an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the \naction” when it unilaterally terminated their grants.  Moreover, as to all Plaintiffs, EPA Defendants \ndid not and have not identified a violation of any applicable regulation or any of the grant’s terms—\nonly that there are concerns about potential conflicts of interest and their grant agreements.  If \nthese concerns are valid, there are, again, procedures that must be followed. \nPage 15 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 16 of 23\nIn  the  termination  letters,  EPA  Defendants  vaguely  reference  “multiple  ongoing \ninvestigations” into “programmatic waste, fraud, and abuse and conflicts of interest” but offer no \nspecific  information  about  such  investigations,  factual  support  for  the  decision,  or  an \nindividualized explanation for each Plaintiff.  This is insufficient.  EPA may terminate the \nagreements for “waste, fraud, or abuse,” but this requires “credible evidence of the commission of \na violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity \nviolations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act \n(31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).”  At this stage, EPA Defendants have not provided the “credible \nevidence” required.  \nAt the court’s request, on March 17, 2025, EPA Defendants submitted a declaration from \nEric Amidon, EPA’s Chief of Staff.  Amidon Decl.; see March 14, 2025 Min. Order (“Federal \nDefendants shall file a declaration addressing the basis for the grant termination, [] including the \nproffer of evidence discussed at the hearing.”).  In his declaration, Amidon details the agency’s \ngeneral concerns with management of the GGRF program, including concerns with lack of \nadequate oversight and transparency into use of grant funding and in the grant agreements, and \npotential conflicts of interest among the grant recipients.  See Amidon Decl. ¶¶ 31–39.   \nAs to individual Plaintiffs, Amidon cites to potential conflicts of interest and concerns \nabout the structure of their grant agreements.  Id. ¶¶ 34–37.  These concerns stemmed, in part, \nfrom public media reporting.  Id. ¶ 33–35.  Amidon also states that there are ongoing criminal and \ncivil investigations and that the EPA Office of Inspector General has initiated an investigation into \nthe GGRF program.  Id. ¶¶ 43.  At this juncture, EPA Defendants have not sufficiently explained \nPage 16 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 17 of 23\nwhy unilaterally terminating Plaintiffs’ grant awards was a rational precursor to reviewing the \nGGRF program.4 \n  At the March 12 hearing, when asked why the grant was terminated, EPA Defendants \nstated that “the termination is based on the information contained in the termination letter.”  TRO \nMot. Hr’g Tr. 18:04–5 (March 12).  When pressed to, at a minimum, even proffer such evidence, \ncounsel for EPA Defendants was unable to, stating that he was only aware of media reports \ndiscussing the termination.  This circular argument and unhelpful response was of no assistance to \nthe court in discerning whether EPA Defendants followed the necessary steps to terminate the \ngrant, or whether EPA Defendants had offered a reasoned explanation for the termination. \nTo be sure, agencies can decide to re-evaluate their programs, or they may decide to end \nagreements or federal awards.  But those decisions must be made lawfully and in accordance with \nestablished  procedures  and  relevant  rules  and  regulations,  including  the  ‘Remedies  for \n \n4 EPA Defendants state that DOJ and FBI have initiated a criminal investigation into the GGRF \nprogram, though they offer not much else on the matter.

When ODAG instructed that a letter be sent directing Citibank to refrain \nfrom releasing funds pursuant to a criminal investigation, senior officials at the USAO-DC again \nasserted there was insufficient evidence to justify issuing that letter.

U.S. Attorney \nsubmitted a seizure warrant application, which a magistrate judge rejected.  There are also reports \nthat ODAG sought a different U.S. attorney’s office to carry out the warrant request for a grand \njury investigation and to obtain a court-ordered bank freeze, but prosecutors in that office refused \nto do so.  The court may take judicial notice of news articles for their existence, but not for the \ntruth of the statements asserted therein.  See, e.g., Hourani v. Psybersolutions, 164 F. Supp. 3d \n128, 132 n.1 (D.D.C. 2016); cf. Banks v. Booth, 459 F. Supp. 3d 143, 149, 154 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(refusing to consider counsel’s assertions during preliminary injunction oral argument absent \ncorroborating record evidence). \nPage 17 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 18 of 23\nNoncompliance’ under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339–200.343, and in accordance with the APA.  The court \ncannot find that EPA complied with these procedures and regulations based on the current record.  \nConsequently, the court finds that Plaintiffs have shown a substantial likelihood of success on the \nmerits on their APA claims.5 \nb.  Irreparable Injury \nPlaintiffs have also made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm.  To show irreparable \nharm, the “injury alleged must be ‘both certain and great, actual and not theoretical, beyond \nremediation, and of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief.’”  \nChurch v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 138 (D.D.C. 2021) (quoting Mexichem Specialty Resins, \nInc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The “‘possibility of irreparable harm’ is not \nenough.”  Id. (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  A plaintiff \nmust demonstrate “a clear and present need for extraordinary equitable relief to prevent harm.”  Id. \n(citation omitted).  “If a party fails to make a sufficient showing of irreparable injury, a court may \ndeny a motion for injunctive relief.”  Beattie v. Barnhart, 663 F. Supp. 2d 5, 8 (D.D.C. 2009) \n(citing CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. Of Thrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 742 (D.C. Cir. 1995)); Hulli \nv. Mayorkas, 549 F. Supp. 3d 95, 99 (D.D.C. 2021) (“[M]ovants are barred from receiving such \nrelief should they fail to establish irreparable injury.”) (collecting authorities). \nThe Supreme Court has held that “[i]ssuing a preliminary injunction based only on a \npossibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of injunctive relief as an \nextraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled \n \n5 Although the parties brief multiple issues, the court need only find that Plaintiffs are likely to \nsucceed on one of their claims for this factor to weigh in their favor, the court does not address \nthese arguments.  See Media Matters for Am. v. Paxton, 732 F. Supp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C.), appeal \ndismissed, No. 24-7059, 2025 WL 492257 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 13, 2025). \nPage 18 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 19 of 23\nto such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis added) (citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. \n968, 972 (1997) (per curiam)).  Based on the current record, the court finds that Plaintiffs satisfy \nthe “high standard for irreparable injury.”  Church, 573 F. Supp. 3d at 138 (quoting Chaplaincy of \nFull Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). \nHere, the harm is not a possibility—as Plaintiffs have shown, without release of the grant \nfunds, imminent harm is unavoidable.  Plaintiffs’ financing for their operations and projects all \nderive from the grant money, which is used to pay employees, pay rent, and fund projects.  \nMoreover, preserving the status quo here is particularly important.  If Citibank transfers money \nout  of  these  accounts,  the  funds  will  not  be  recoverable.    In  cases  involving  government \nexpenditures, “once the relevant funds have been obligated, a court cannot reach them in order to \naward relief.”  City of Houston v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426–27 (D.C. Cir. \n1994).  Any transfer, re-allocation, or re-obligation of these funds would be an irreparable loss.   \nWhile ordinary economic injuries are usually insufficient to require injunctive relief, \nfinancial harm can “constitute irreparable harm . . . where the loss threatens the very existence of \nthe movant’s business.”  Wisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Without \naccess to the grant funds, Plaintiffs have no cash or reserves available to pay their operating \nexpenses, and they have no other committed sources of funding that could replace the grant award.  \nSee Brafford Decl. ¶¶ 40, 43; Timothy Mayopoulos Decl. (“Mayopoulos Decl.”) ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs \nwill be unable to finance programs they have launched, and they will have to cease operations. \nFor example, to date, Plaintiff Climate United has committed $392 million to qualified \nprojects and has launched three financing projects.  Brafford Decl. ¶ 44.  It has: \n•  Committed a $31.8 million pre-construction loan to finance 18 solar projects \nbenefiting rural communities in Arkansas.  This is the largest commercial solar \ndeployment in Arkansas history and is projected to save over $120 million in \nenergy costs over the project’s life and create hundreds of jobs. \nPage 19 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 20 of 23\n•  Launched a program to establish affordable leasing options for battery electric \nheavy-duty trucks to small fleets and independent contractors, which will \nsupport an affordable leasing program at the ports of Long Beach and Los \nAngeles before expanding across the country.  \n•  Committed  $63  million  in  pre-construction  financing  for  the  design  and \ndevelopment of solar power plants in partnership with Tribal governments and \ncommunities in Eastern Oregon and Idaho, bringing access to affordable energy \nto rural communities and Indigenous people, creating 1,200 jobs, and spurring \nlocal economic development. \n \nId. ¶¶ 24–26.  \n \nIn her declaration, Bafford includes concrete examples of both monetary and non-monetary \nimminent harms.  Specifically: \n•  Climate United cannot currently access funds to pay its payroll and other \nexpenses related to immediate implementation of its grant workplan.  Id. ¶ 39. \n•  Climate United has had to defer compensation for certain employees to preserve \nits limited cash.  Id. \n•  Without a stable source of funding, Climate United will no longer be able to \npay its employees and will face having to cut hours and furlough staff.  Id.  \n•  Climate United imminently risks not being able to pay payroll or health, vision, \nand dental benefits, life insurance, and disability insurance for its employees.  \nId. ¶ 43. \n•  Furloughing or laying off staff will eliminate positions that perform critical \nfunctions for Climate United, including monitoring the loans that Climate \nUnited has already disbursed to funding recipients and the $392 million that it \nhas committed to date.  Id. ¶ 44. \n•  Climate United imminently risks not being able to pay rent or insurance for \ncertain offices or to pay third-party contractors who perform necessary tasks \nsuch  as  auditing  its  financial  statements,  maintaining  its  IT  security  and \ninfrastructure, and providing legal services.  Id. ¶ 45. \n•  Continued failure to access the funds would prevent Climate United from \nmeeting its commitments under the loans and awards it has approved and plans \nto approve, potentially forcing it into breach of its existing agreements.  Id. \n¶¶ 46–48, 50. \n \nAs to PFC, the freeze has impacted the organization’s ability to carry on day-to-day \noperations and fulfill its legal obligations.  Power Forward, TRO Mot. at 28.  For example, “the \ninability of PFC and its Subrecipients to access their NCIF funds impedes their ability to pay their \nPage 20 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 21 of 23\npeople.”  Id. at 29.  PFC’s staff are either employees whose positions are funded by the NCIF \naward or secondees on loan to PFC under secondment and services agreements.  Id.  PFC’s \ninability “to access funds has placed it at imminent risk of defaulting on contracts with critical \nvendors—including for financial management, IT, legal, and management consultant services.”  \nId.  PFC has committed at least $539,000,000 to provide affordable housing support and has other \nprojects that will be detrimentally impacted absent funding.  TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. (March 17) 24:01–\n25:04. \nAs PFC’s President and CEO, Timothy Mayopoulos, details: \n•  PFC has been unable to pay outstanding invoices from contractors for work \ncompleted on PFC’s behalf and, as a result, PFC is incurring default risk with \nrespect to these contracts.  Mayopoulos Decl. ¶ 18. \n•  These include contracts for legal and management consultant services that are \nnecessary for PFC to administer the grant in compliance with the terms of the \nAward Agreement and contracts for essential financial management and IT \nservices.  Id. \n•  If PFC is not able to make payment on these outstanding invoices, which it \ncannot do without access to its funds, PFC is at imminent risk of losing these \nservices due to default.  Id. \n•  PFC’s key contractor, for example, has advised that PFC has until March 17, \n2025, to make payment or it may cease providing services.  Id. \n•  PFC is also unable to pay contractors to complete, or in some cases to begin, \ncritical work for PFC.  This includes the completion of a financial reporting \naudit  and  work  improve  PFC’s  website  that  is  necessary  to  help  make \ninformation available to the public.  Id. ¶ 19. \n•  PFC’s inability to access its funds threatens its ability to compensate these staff \nmembers.  PFC owes funds under the secondment and services agreements and \nis at risk of default under those agreements.  Id. ¶ 20. \n \nPlaintiffs have made a sufficient preliminary showing that the loss of its grant funding \n“threatens the very existence of [its] business.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674. \nc.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nThe final two factors—balancing the equities and the public interest—further support \ngranting a TRO.  When assessing the equities and public interest, courts “balance the competing \nPage 21 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 22 of 23\nclaims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the \nrequested relief.”  Ramirez v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enft., 310 F. Supp. 3d 7, 32 (D.D.C. 2018).  \nIf  the  movant  seeks  to  enjoin  the  government,  the  final  two  factors  merge  “because  the \ngovernment’s interest is the public interest.”  Pursuing Am.’s Greatness v. Fed. Election Comm., \n831 F.3d 500, 511–512 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  Although Plaintiffs seek to enjoin both Citibank and the \ngovernment, the parties acknowledge that Citibank is caught in the middle of the dispute between \nPlaintiffs and EPA Defendants.  Nonetheless, the court will address both factors.  \nBecause neither Citibank nor EPA will suffer significant harm from a temporary injunction \npreserving the status quo, the balance of equities support granting a TRO.  Citibank previously \nanticipated disbursing the funds to Plaintiffs.  The court merely orders the parties to preserve the \nstatus quo—that is, for Citibank to maintain the grant funds in Plaintiffs’ respective accounts.  As \nto EPA Defendants, the government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an \nunlawful practice.”  TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 507 F. Supp. 3d 92, 115 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting R.I.L-\nR v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015)).  \nWhen the court asked EPA to proffer evidence justifying its decision given the terms of \nthe agreement, its only response was to refer to the termination letter, which gave no legal \njustification for the termination.  TRO Mot. Hr’g Tr. (March 12) 18:04–5.  While EPA Defendants \nvoice concerns regarding “program integrity,” “programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse,” and “the \nabsence  of  adequate  oversight  and  account  controls  to  prevent  financial  mismanagement, \nTermination Letter at 1–2, vague and unsubstantiated assertions of fraud are insufficient.  See Am. \nForeign Serv. Assoc. v. Trump, No. 2025 WL 434415, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb. 7, 2025) (finding “no \ndifficulty concluding that the balance of the hardships favors the plaintiffs” when government “had \nno response—beyond asserting without any record support that USAID writ large was possibly \nPage 22 of 23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 28     Filed 03/18/25     Page 23 of 23\nengaging in ‘corruption and fraud’”).  On the other side, Plaintiffs face irreparable harm absent a \nTRO.  By preserving the status quo, the court is not “forcing  the government to undo its \ntermination” or allowing “grantees to access billions of dollars in grant funds,” as EPA Defendants \nargue.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 25–26.  Preserving the status quo does not make these funds unrecoverable. \nThe public interest also favors a TRO.  “There is generally no public interest in the \nperpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, \n12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing Pursuing Am.’s Greatness, 831 F.3d at 511–512).  In contrast, “there \nis a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.’”  Id. (citation omitted).  Here, temporary relief ensures that \nthe government abides by the statutes and regulations governing the NCIF, which serves the public \ninterest.  Therefore, the final two factors warrant the narrow TRO issued here. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, it is hereby ORDERED that Plaintiffs’ Motions for a Temporary \nRestraining Order are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.  An Order will accompany this \nMemorandum Opinion.  \nDate: March 18, 2025 \nTanya S. Chutkan \nTANYA S. CHUTKAN \nUnited States District Judge \nPage 23 of 23 \n ",

California.  State Green Bank \nPlaintiffs hereby respond to that motion but note that the motion itself contains no explanation of \nwhy it could not have been filed earlier, nor why Plaintiffs were given no notice.  State Green \nBanks further incorporate by reference the arguments they have already made on these issues in \ntheir past briefing.  See ECF No. 66 (State Green Bank Pls.’ Resp. to EPA’s Not. of Authority); \nCase No. 25-cv-820, ECF No. 17 (State Green Bank Pls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.).  State Green \nBanks also do not oppose the extension of the TRO by one day and note, in response to EPA’s \nopposition to that extension, ECF No. 76, that such an extension was necessitated by EPA’s own \nlate-breaking motion. \nIn any event, EPA’s contingent emergency motion does not add anything of substance to \nthe briefing already before this Court.  EPA offers no new arguments on the merits, nor any \njustification that would entitle it to the “extraordinary remedy” of a stay pending appeal.  If the \nCourt issues a preliminary injunction, EPA may appeal that order in the ordinary course, as is its \nright, but there is no reason for this Court to stay its own order pending that appeal. \nContrary to EPA’s claims, this Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims in this action, \nand the Supreme Court’s per curiam order in Department of Education v. California (DOE), 145 \nS. Ct. 966 (2025) does not change that.  State Green Bank Plaintiffs’ claims are not founded in \ncontract.  Rather, the source of Plaintiffs’ rights is the Constitution, the Inflation Reduction Act, \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and federal regulations.  And the fact that part of one \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 77     Filed 04/15/25     Page 3 of 9\nof their claims may require the Court to examine a grant agreement does not defeat this Court’s \njurisdiction over their claims.  The Supreme Court’s order in DOE, which was not a \ndetermination on the merits of any claim or issue and was issued based on abbreviated briefing, \nheld only that a TRO should be stayed pending appeal based on the particular facts in DOE.  For \nthe reasons already explained in State Green Banks’ prior submission on this issue, DOE is \ndistinguishable from this case.  Nor do any of EPA’s other arguments support a stay pending \nappeal.  The Court should deny EPA’s last-minute motion and issue its order on the motions for \npreliminary injunction.  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n“In the D.C. Circuit, a court assesses four factors when considering a motion to stay an \ninjunction pending appeal: (1) the moving party's likelihood of success on the merits of its \nappeal, (2) whether the moving party will suffer irreparable injury, (3) whether issuance of the \nstay would substantially harm other parties in the proceeding, and (4) the public interest.”  \nAkiachak Native Cmty. v. Jewell, 995 F. Supp. 2d 7, 12 (D.D.C. 2014) (citing Wash. Met. Area \nTransit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977)).  “[I]t is the \nmovant’s obligation to justify the court’s exercise of such an extraordinary remedy.”  Id. \n(quoting Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 978 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). \nARGUMENT \nI.  EPA HAS FAILED TO SHOW THAT IT IS LIKELY TO PREVAIL ON APPEAL \nEPA has not demonstrated that it is likely to prevail on appeal in the eventa  preliminary \ninjunction is entered in Plaintiffs’ favor.  To the contrary, Plaintiffs are likely to prevail in any \nsuch appeal.  The likelihood of Plaintiffs’ success on the merits has already been briefed \nextensively.  State Green Banks therefore do not set forth the same arguments in full again here \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 77     Filed 04/15/25     Page 4 of 9\nand instead respond briefly to this issue in context of EPA’s new motion for a stay.  \nFirst, this Court has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims, and DOE does not hold \notherwise.  Plaintiffs’ claims arise out of the Constitution, the Inflation Reduction Act, the APA, \nand federal regulations, and, at their core, seek to enjoin EPA’s unlawful attempt to subvert and \ndismantle the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, in contravention of Congress’s stated intent and \nprior appropriation of these funds.  Although Plaintiffs’ success on the merits would allow them \nto resume spending money they received pursuant to grant agreements, the Supreme Court \naffirmed in DOE that “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order \nsetting aside an agency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds.”  145 S. Ct. at 968 \n(quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 (1988)).  And in any event, as Plaintiffs \nexplained in their response to EPA’s Notice of Authority, they are not seeking an order requiring \nthe government to disburse funds to them because the government has already disbursed funds to \nthem.  Similarly, they are not seeking “to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money,” see id., \nor seeking to require EPA to “specifically perform any contractual obligation,” ECF No. 75 at 9, \nbecause the government has already paid out funds to Plaintiffs’ accounts.  Plaintiffs seek only \nto enjoin EPA from continuing to unlawfully interfere with their access to and use of those funds \nconsistent with the Inflation Reduction Act, which they are entitled to do in this Court.  See Nat’l \nCtr. for Mfg. Scis. v. United States, 114 F.3d 196, 200 (Fed. Cir. 1997) (“Like the grant-in-aid \napplicants referred to in Bowen v. Massachusetts, NCMS is seeking funds to which it claims it is \nentitled under a statute; it is not seeking money in compensation for losses that it has suffered or \nwill suffer as a result of the withholding of those funds.”). \nSecond, EPA’s continued reliance on a theory of “agency discretion” is misplaced.  APA \nreview is unavailable only “in those rare instances where statutes are drawn in such broad terms \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 77     Filed 04/15/25     Page 5 of 9\nthat in a given case there is no law to apply.”  Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, \n401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (citation omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Califano v. Sanders, \n430 U.S. 99 (1977).  That is not the case here, where regulations clearly set out the boundaries \nfor EPA’s conduct.  Indeed, those regulations are among the bases for Plaintiffs’ claims. \nFinally, while EPA cites to a single case applying DOE to dissolve a TRO, multiple \ndistrict courts have found DOE distinguishable.  Maine v. U.S. Dep’t of Ag., 2025 WL 1088946, \nat *19 n.8 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025); New York v. Trump, 2025 WL 1093966, at *1-2 (D. R.I. Apr. \n14, 2025); The Sustainability Institute v. Trump, No. 2:25-cv-2152, ECF No. 52 (D.S.C. Apr. 9, \n2025).  This Court should follow suit. \nII.  A STAY WILL CAUSE IRREPARABLE HARM TO PLAINTIFFS, NOT EPA \nTo begin, EPA makes no meaningful attempt to articulate any irreparable harm it would \nsuffer from an order requires the funds in dispute to remain at Citibank during the pendency of \nthis action, which is the primary relief State Green Banks seek.  This is because EPA will suffer \nno harm from such an order.  EPA’s motion for a “stay” in this regard would, far from \nmaintaining the status quo, allow the funds to return to the federal government, thereby altering \nthe status quo ante, rendering those funds all but impossible to retrieve and return to Plaintiffs if \nthey later prevail on the merits, and causing Plaintiffs irreparable harm.  See City of Houston v. \nDep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, 1426-27 (D.C. Cir. 1994).  In contrast, keeping the \nfunds at Citibank will ensure that they are available to whichever party ultimately prevails in this \naction.  Notably, that is the relief the Court issued in its TRO, and EPA points to no harms it has \nsuffered as a result in the weeks since the Court issued that order. \nEven if the Court issues a preliminary injunction that orders Citibank to resume fulfilling \nPlaintiffs’ disbursement requests, EPA will not be harmed.  Any requests submitted by Plaintiffs \nand fulfilled by Citibank will be made pursuant to and consistent with the Inflation Reduction \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 77     Filed 04/15/25     Page 6 of 9\nAct’s requirements for dispensing these funds.  Simply put, EPA will not be harmed by \nPlaintiffs’ compliance with the law.  Notably, EPA does not suggest that any of the \ndisbursements Plaintiffs seek to have fulfilled are inconsistent with the applicable requirements.  \nBut Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm if they continue to be denied access to their Citibank \naccounts, as set forth in their prior briefing.  Plaintiffs face imminent economic and reputational \nharms as a result of EPA’s actions, as explained in their prior briefing.  If Plaintiffs are unable to \nresume their funding activities, they will be unable to provide financing to the projects they had \nplanned to support, and their reputations as green banks will be irreparably harmed.  As detailed \nfurther in their Motion for Preliminary Injunction, EPA’s conduct may even negatively impact \nState Green Banks’ ability to acquire future funding, if left unchecked. \nFinally, EPA’s contention that the Court could issue a preliminary injunction order and \nthen find sufficient harm to EPA to stay that order pending appeal (and not merely as a brief \nadministrative measure pending EPA’s application to the D.C. Circuit for a stay) is logically \ninconsistent.  “Under these circumstances, where the order stayed involves a preliminary \ninjunction, a principle element of which is a finding of irreparable harm that is imminent, it is \nlogically inconsistent, and in fact a fatal flaw, to subsequently find no irreparable nor even \nserious harm to the Plaintiffs pending appeal.”  Rodriguez ex rel. Rodriguez v. DeBuono, 175 \nF.3d 227, 235 (2d Cir. 1999).  If the Court finds sufficient irreparable harm to issue a preliminary \ninjunction in this case, it should not issue a stay of that order pending appeal, as that would \neffectively negate the order and cause Plaintiffs to suffer the very harms the preliminary \ninjunction is designed to protect. \nIII.  THE PUBLIC INTEREST DISFAVORS A STAY PENDING APPEAL \nFinally, the balance of equitable factors, and in particular the public interest, supports \ndenial of EPA’s motion.  EPA continues to rely on its contention that it is “safeguarding the \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00698-TSC     Document 77     Filed 04/15/25     Page 7 of 9\npublic fisc,” but Plaintiffs are not seeking to spend money from the public fisc in a manner \nharmful to the public.  Rather, granting Plaintiffs the relief they seek would simply allow them to \nresume spending money consistent with Congress’ appropriation of funds for that purpose in the \nInflation Reduction Act.  It is EPA who undermines the public interest by continuing to try to \nstop Plaintiffs’ lawful fulfillment of Congress’ intent by clawing back funds that were duly \nobligated and have been lawfully disbursed to Plaintiff.  As the Court has already recognized, \n“[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action,” and “there \nis a substantial interest in ‘having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern \ntheir existence and operations.’”  ECF No. 28 at 23. (quoting League of Women Voters of U.S. v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny EPA’s motion. \nDate: April 15, 2025  Respectfully submitted,   \n     \nROB BONTA  KEITH ELLISON   \nAttorney General of California  Minnesota Attorney General \n   \ns/ Meghan Strong      s/ Peter N.

Citing \nconcerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA \nterminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and \nthe district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA \nand Citibank to continue funding the grants.  \nWe conclude the district court abused its discretion in \nissuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed \non the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, \nand  therefore  jurisdiction  lies  exclusively  in  the  Court  of \nFederal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction \nover the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. \nMoreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which \non behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and \nmanagement of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we \nvacate the injunction.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 4 of 92\n4 \nI. \nThis  case  involves  EPA  grants  awarded  under  the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund,  for  which  Congress \nappropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. \nL. No. 117-169, § 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065–67 (formerly \ncodified at 42 U.S.C. § 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA \nawarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the \ngrant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund \nand the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of \nthose grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund \n($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power \nForward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 \nbillion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).  \nEach grant was memorialized in an agreement between the \nnonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual \nstructure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S. Treasury \nand  disbursed  incrementally  as  grantees  use  the  funds  for \nprogram  purposes.  EPA  structured  these  grants  with  a \nmiddleman that would hold the funds as a “financial agent” of \nthe United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the \nfederal  government  used  a  financial  agent,  as  opposed  to \nTreasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury \nentered a Financial Agency Agreement (“FAA”) with Citibank. \nAs set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be \ntransferred  from  Treasury  to  Citibank  in  a  “two-step \ntransaction” involving a “drawdown” by the grantee and a \nsubsequent  “disbursement”  to  the  appropriate  Citibank \naccount. J.A. 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \n“an allowable cost” under “the EPA award.” Id.  \nAlthough the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees’ use \nof the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used \nonly “for the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 5 of 92\n5 \nagreement],” and “must be maintained” at Citibank until the \nend  of  the  grant’s  period  of  performance.  J.A.  568.  The \ngrantees’ use of the funds is further restricted by Account \nControl Agreements (“ACAs”) between EPA, Citibank, and \neach of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a “right \nto exclusive control” over the Citibank accounts. J.A. 72. If the \ngovernment  exercises  that  right,  Citibank  must  follow  the \ngovernment’s transfer instructions “without further consent by \nthe  [grantee].”  Id.  The  ACAs  expressly  acknowledge  that \nCitibank  “act[s]  as  a  financial  agent  of  the  United  States \npursuant  to  the  authority  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  the \nTreasury.” J.A. 71. \nThe sheer scale of the grant program and the method of \nallocating  billions  of  dollars  drew  public  attention  and \ncriticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in \nwhich an EPA employee was recorded describing how “until \nrecently” his role was to make sure proper “processes are in \nplace to … prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,” but after the \nelection of President Donald Trump, EPA was “just trying to \nget the money out as fast as possible before they come in \nand … stop it all.” J.A. 705 n.1. The employee compared the \nsituation to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.”  \nThe month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA \nmodified  the  grant  agreements—with  no  apparent \nconsideration from the grantees—to make it more difficult for \nthe government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the \n \n1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant \nagreements,  including  by  (1) eliminating  any  reference  to \ntermination  for  agency  priorities;  (2) requiring  “credible \nevidence … of  a  violation  of  Federal  criminal  law”  before  the \ngovernment could exercise its contractual right to terminate for \nwaste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 6 of 92\n6 \ninauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \n“continue  to  disburse  funds”  to  the  grantees,  even  if  the \ngovernment exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds \nare “associated with financial obligations ‘properly incurred’” \nbefore the government exercised its right. J.A. 658. \nAfter the change in administration, EPA reviewed the \ngrants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the \naward process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, \nlack of government oversight and control over tens of billions \nof dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements \nand  ACAs.2  In  February  2025,  the  FBI  recommended  to \nCitibank  that  it  “place  an  administrative  freeze  on  the \naccount(s)  associated  with”  the  grantees’  ACAs.  As  the \ngovernment’s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped \ndisbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter \nto the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly \nthereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements. \nThe grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as \nunconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They \nsought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating \nthe grants “except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, \nthe grant award, and applicable law,” and ordering Citibank to \n \nto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these \nmodifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the \nincoming administration would constitute a breach of contract. \n2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter \nto  the  EPA  Inspector  General  that  “the  former  director  of  the \n[Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion \ngrant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital – \nwithout recusing himself.” J.A. 670. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 7 of 92\n7 \nresume disbursements “in accordance with the ACA.” J.A. \n171–72.  \nThe district court entered the injunction. It first held that it \nhad  jurisdiction  because  the  grantees’  claims  were  not \nessentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought \nin  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims.  Climate  United  Fund  v. \nCitibank, N.A., 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107–11 (D.D.C. 2025). On \nthe merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to \nsucceed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and \ncapricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms \nsupported an injunction because the nonprofits exist “to fulfill \nthe objectives of a grant” and “sufficient protections [are] in \nplace” to prevent “reckless spending.” Id. at 117, 120. The \ndistrict court further concluded that an injunction “halt[ing] any \nunlawful action” serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court \nenjoined  Citibank  as  well,  requiring  it  to  disburse  funds \naccording to the relevant agreements. \nWe administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the \nparties to take no action “directly or indirectly” with respect to \nthe  disputed  funds,  thereby  prohibiting  the  grantees  from \nmaking further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. \nWe then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal. \nII. \nWhile  this  litigation  was  pending,  Congress  enacted \nlegislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See \nPub.  L.  No.  119-21,  § 60002,  139  Stat.  72,  154  (2025) \n(repealing  42  U.S.C.  § 7434  and  rescinding  “unobligated \nbalances of amounts made available to carry out that section”). \nOur partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the \ndistrict court’s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the \nfunds at  issue in this case remain at  Citibank and  remain \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 8 of 92\n8 \nobligated. Congress’s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund therefore did not render this appeal moot. \nWe review the district court’s preliminary injunction for \nabuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, \nand  its  findings  of  fact  for  clear  error.  Huisha-Huisha  v. \nMayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022). We consider the \nsame Winter factors the district court applied, which require a \nplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it “is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is \nin the public interest.” Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  \nIII. \nThe district court erred in concluding the grantees are \nlikely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, \nand constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, \n1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the \nmerits  as  the  “most  important  factor”  when  considering  a \npreliminary injunction). The grantees’ regulatory and arbitrary \nand capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal \nClaims, and their constitutional claim is meritless. \nA. \nThe grantees first allege the termination of their grants \nviolated  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”) \nregulations  and  was  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). As a remedy, they \nsought and received an injunction barring the termination of \ntheir grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. \nWe conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 9 of 92\n9 \nclaims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be \nheard in the Court of Federal Claims.3  \n1. \nThe federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and \nmay be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that \nimmunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976). \nWaivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to \nprotect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the \ncourts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See \nLane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic & \nForeign  Com.  Corp.,  337  U.S.  682,  703–05  (1949).  The \ngrantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \n“seeking relief other than money damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nBut this waiver applies only if no “other statute that grants \nconsent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which \nis sought.” Id. For contract claims against the government, the \nTucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, \nwhich  may  award  only  damages  and  cannot  provide \n \n3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question \na  “diver[sion],”  Dissenting  Op.  47,  our  authority  to  assess  the \nlawfulness  of  EPA’s  actions  of  course  depends  on  having \njurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 \n(1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies \nwith the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The \ndissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by \nrecounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous \nadministration’s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act \nand the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating \nthe grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity \nof the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by \nThe  Washington  Post,  The  New  York  Times,  and  Politico.  See \nDissenting Op. 11, 12, 14, 36. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 10 of 92\n10 \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief except in narrow circumstances. \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1491; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, \n963 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Walters v. Sec’y of Defense, 725 \nF.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  \nWhen it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and \nprecludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA’s waiver \nof sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. \nof Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The \nCourt of Federal  Claims is  the “single, uniquely  qualified \nforum for the resolution of contractual disputes.” Ingersoll-\nRand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985). \nBecause Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for \ncontract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim \nis essentially contractual cannot “avoid the jurisdictional (and \nhence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act” by simply \nasking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 \nF.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (“[T]he APA does not \nwaive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific \nrelief.”).  \nThis  jurisdictional  inquiry  cannot  turn  on  a  plaintiff’s \npreferred  characterization  of  its  claim,  lest  we  “upset  the \ncarefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant \nof remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker \nAct.” Int’l Eng’g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d \n573, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1975); see also McKay v. United States, \n \n4 The Tucker Act contains one exception to this rule, not relevant in \nthis suit involving billions of dollars. Damages claims not exceeding \n$10,000 may be brought in district court, although the Tucker Act’s \nremedial restrictions still apply. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2); Int’l \nEng’g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 577 n.4 (D.C. \nCir. 1975); see also Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-\n563, §§ 3(a), 10(a), 14(a), 92 Stat. 2383, 2383–84, 2388–89 (limiting \nexception to non-procurement claims). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 11 of 92\n11 \n516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (“[I]n the contract context, \na distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign’s immunity \nfrom  being  compelled  to  perform  obligations  it  prefers  to \nbreach and compensate financially, holding that what are ‘in \nessence’ claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the \nTucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being \nartfully pled as something else.”). \nTo  determine  whether  jurisdiction  was  proper  in  the \ndistrict court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees’ \nclaims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–\n68. The fact that the grantees’ “complaint nowhere mentions \nbreach  of  contract … cannot  alone  suffice  to  establish \njurisdiction in the District Court.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at \n77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether “the source \nof the rights” asserted is contractual or is “based on truly \nindependent legal grounds” and (2) whether “the type of relief \nsought” is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at \n968–71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.  \n2. \nThe  grantees  first  allege  EPA’s  termination  of  their \nagreements  violated  OMB  regulations.  By  terminating  for \n“agency  priorities,”  EPA  allegedly  relied  on  a  basis  for \ntermination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation \nof 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed \nto provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.341(a).  Despite  the  grantees’  characterization,  their \nclaims are essentially  contractual and therefore the district \ncourt lacked jurisdiction to hear them.  \nFirst, the source of the grantees’ right to the relief they seek \nis  their  agreements,  which  are  contracts  for  Tucker  Act \npurposes. See Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 \n(2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 12 of 92\n12 \n990 F.3d 1330, 1338–41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. \nPlanned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) \n(explaining  that  courts  have  historically  described  federal \ngrants as contracts). Each grantee’s right to the funds arises \n“only upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the \ngovernment; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that \ncontract.” Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d \n891,  894  (D.C.  Cir.  1985).  While  the  grantees  attempt  to \nground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these \nclaims may be understood “as entirely contained within the \nterms  of  the  contract”  or  in  principles  of  contract  law. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.  \nThe claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) \nexpressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The \ngrantees  interpret  this  OMB  guidance  as  prohibiting  the \ngovernment from terminating based on agency priorities unless \nthe grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those \ngrounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the \ngrantees’ claim turns on the government’s rights under the \nagreements—a  question  of  contract  interpretation  that  the \nparties  fiercely  dispute.  Because  this  claim  perforce \nincorporates the grant agreements, it is not based “solely” on \nthe  regulation  or  on  “truly  independent  legal  grounds.” \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969–\n70.  \nThe  claim  that  EPA  failed  to  give  proper  notice  of \ntermination in violation of 2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a) is not an \nindependent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This \nallegation “could be phrased” as a claim that the government \nstopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 13 of 92\n13 \nwhen defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and \ntherefore the substance of the grantees’ claim can be analyzed \n“solely on contract principles.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. \nAs  we  have  explained,  the  fact  that  the  government’s \ntermination of a contract “also arguably violates certain other \nregulations does not transform the action into one based solely \non those regulations.” Id. Indeed, “[i]f the mere allegation” of \nviolations of the regulations governing federal contracting and \ngrantmaking “were to bring claims of this type within the \njurisdiction  of  the  district  court,  Congress’  intent  to  limit \ncontract remedies against the government to damages in the \n[Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented.” \nId. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees’ notice \nclaim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially \ncontractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal \nClaims.  The  grantees  cannot  avoid  the  Tucker  Act’s \njurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract \nclaim as a claim that the government violated the regulations \ngoverning grantmaking. \nFurthermore,  the  guidance  documents  on  which  the \ngrantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights \nbecause they merely set out principles for agencies to follow \nwhen  making  grants.  See  Guidance  for  Federal  Financial \nAssistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089–90 (Apr. 22, 2024). \nThese guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, \nwhich sets forth OMB’s “guidance to Federal agencies on \n \n5 See, e.g., Decker & Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) \n(“[H]arm  should  accompany  a  defect  in  an  otherwise  proper \ntermination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on \nthat defect.”); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 \nF.2d 569, 572–73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government’s \ntermination as defective because government’s regulatory violations \nwere “harmless technical defects”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 14 of 92\n14 \ngovernment-wide policies for the award and administration of \nFederal financial assistance.” 2 C.F.R. § 1.100(a). “Publication \nof the OMB guidance in the [Code of Federal Regulations] \ndoes not change its nature—it is guidance, not regulation.” Id. \n§ 1.105(b).  But  in  any  event,  as  the  dissent  concedes, \nDissenting  Op.  58,  these  regulatory  claims  are  essentially \ncontractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them. \nSecond,  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  has  exclusive \njurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual \nin nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA \nfrom terminating the grants, “except as permitted in accordance \nwith  the ACA, the grant  award, and applicable law,” and \nordering  Citibank  to  resume  disbursements  “in  accordance \nwith the ACA.” The grantees maintain they own the funds and \nseek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an \norder for specific performance. But the grantees’ “ownership” \nof the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the \nACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts \nas a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, \nin substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of \ntheir agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia \n \n6 The dissent’s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns \non the claim that the grantees have “title” to the billions of dollars in \ngovernment  funding.  To  demonstrate  the  grantees’  ownership, \nhowever, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs—\nthat is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties’ \nrelationship.  Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent’s  argument merely \nreinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of \nFederal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow \nsecured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a \nTakings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and \nwhich in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of \nFederal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 15 of 92\n15 \nexplained, “[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] \ndoes not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific \nperformance in contract cases.”7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 \nF.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C. Cir. 1986). “[A] complaint involving a \nrequest  for  specific  performance  must  be  resolved  by  the \n[Court of Federal] Claims.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80. \nIn sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court \njurisdiction  through  artful  pleading.  Because  the  grantees’ \nregulatory  claims  are  essentially  contractual,  they  must  be \nheard in the Court of Federal Claims. \n3. \nNor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by \ninvoking the APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The \ngrantees’ arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially \n \n2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act “provides the standard \nprocedure  for  bringing  [takings]  claims”  against  the  federal \ngovernment  and  that  “[e]quitable  relief  [is]  not  available”  if \n“monetary relief … under the Tucker Act” is). \n7 The dissent’s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, \nthere was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he \nhad an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that \ninterest without due process could be litigated in district court under \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at \n1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are \ndisputed. The grantees assert they “performed” on their contracts \nwhen Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government’s \nfinancial  agent.  Even  overlooking  the  oddity  of  this  argument, \nwhether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms \nof the disputed contracts—a question that must be adjudicated in the \nCourt of Federal Claims.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 16 of 92\n16 \ncontractual,  considering  both  the  source  of  the  legal  right \nasserted and the remedy sought.  \nThe  grantees  assert  the  government  acted  arbitrarily \nbecause it “offered no facts or individualized reasoning to \njustify” the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can \nchallenge  the  sufficiency  of  the  government’s  reasons  for \nterminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the \nterminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court \nhas expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture \ndistrict  court  jurisdiction  by  framing  contract  claims  as \nviolations of the APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. \nSee Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77–78; Richardson, 512 F.2d \nat 580. Despite the grantees’ characterizations, the remedy they \nseek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have \nidentified no right to that relief that is “truly independent” of \nthe grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. \nAs  already  discussed  in  reference  to  the  grantees’ \nregulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant \nterminations, which means they seek specific performance. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79–80. This is a “typical contract \nremedy” that indicates a claim is “founded upon a contract for \npurposes of the Tucker Act.” Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at \n894–95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.  \nThe APA’s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious \naction  does  not  give  the  grantees  an  independent  right  to \nspecific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent \nthe grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing \nto follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can \nbe evaluated only by “reference to and incorporation of” the \nagreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the \nright  asserted  is  therefore  not  “truly  independent”  of  the \ncontracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 17 of 92\n17 \nTo the extent the grantees argue the terminations were \narbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the \nagreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of \nfederal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \n“dishonor[ing],  with  impunity,  its  contractual  obligations” \neven when a contract allows the government to terminate for \nconvenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, \n1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees’ argument \nthat the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a \nclaim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating \nwith “impunity.” That claim must be brought in the Court of \nFederal Claims.  \nThe grantees insist the APA gives them an independent \nright to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract \nterminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA’s \ngeneral bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract \nterminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77–78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at \n580 (“[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to \ncontract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA].”). \nThe APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \n“destroy  the  Court  of  [Federal]  Claims  by  implication.” \nRichardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).  \n \n8 The dissent’s analysis focuses on the grantees’ “theory of relief” \nand concludes that because the grantees have “legitimate” APA \nclaims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. \nDissenting Op. 56–57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent \nrequire that we look beyond plaintiffs’ characterization of their \nclaims  and  determine  whether  the  claims  are  “based  on  truly \nindependent legal grounds,” not simply whether plaintiffs have made \ngood faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969–70. On \nthis central question, the dissent has nothing to offer.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 18 of 92\n18 \nIn sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims \nthat  the  federal  government  terminated  a  grant  agreement \narbitrarily  or  with  impunity.  Claims  of  arbitrary  grant \ntermination  are  essentially  contractual  and  fall  outside  the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity. \nThis  conclusion  is  reinforced  by  the  Supreme  Court’s \nrecent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary \nand capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely \ncould not be brought in district court. See Dep’t of Educ., 145 \nS. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court \nand  claimed  the  Department  of  Education’s  decision  to \nterminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court \nstayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely \nlacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because “the Tucker \nAct grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits \nbased on ‘any express or implied contract with the United \nStates.’” Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme \nCourt has doubled down on this conclusion in another case \nstaying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \n“The [APA]’s ‘limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity’ does \nnot provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate \nclaims ‘based on’” the plaintiffs’ grants “or to order relief \ndesigned to enforce any ‘obligation to pay money’ pursuant to \nthose grants.” Nat’l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health \nAss’n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) \n(quoting Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968). \nThe  Court’s  reasoning  requires  respect  and  strongly \nsupports  our  conclusion  that  the  grantees’  arbitrary  and \ncapricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised \ncontract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump \nv. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (“Although our interim \norders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 19 of 92\n19 \ncourt should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.”); \nPriests  for  Life v.

Pol’y 827, 831 (2021) \n(arguing  some  emergency  orders  are  “authoritative  with \nrespect to future cases considering the same legal questions”).  \nIn the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees \nnonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and \ncapricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they \nrely cannot support that conclusion.  \nThe grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency’s \ngrant termination under the APA’s arbitrary and capricious \nstandard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C. Cir. 1991). But the \ncourt in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did \nit engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. \nThis drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. \nv. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998). Just one \nyear  later,  we  extensively  considered  the  jurisdictional \nframework  and  “decline[d]  to  overrule  this  Court’s  very \nspecific  holdings  that  the  APA  does  not  waive  sovereign \nimmunity  for  contract  claims  seeking  specific  relief.” \nTransohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court’s stay order \nin Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier \nand  does  not  support  district  court  jurisdiction  over  the \ngrantees’ arbitrary and capricious claims. \nSecond, the grantees point to Maryland Department of \nHuman  Resources  v.  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices, which held that a state agency could maintain an \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 20 of 92\n20 \narbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the \nfederal government’s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d \n1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal \ngovernment was required by law to pay block grant funds to \nMaryland according to  a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1397a(a)–(b),  1397b(b)  (1982).  We  explained  that \nMaryland’s  claim  was  not  contractual  for  purposes  of  the \nTucker Act because it “turn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes \nand  regulations  rather  than  on  the  interpretation  of  an \nagreement negotiated by the parties.” Maryland, 763 F.2d at \n1449. There was no “contract within the meaning of the Tucker \nAct”—only statutes and regulations that dictated how much \nMaryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, \nand under what circumstances the federal government could \nwithhold payment. Id.  \nBy contrast, these grant agreements are “contracts” within \nthe  meaning  of  the  Tucker  Act  because  they  include  the \ntraditional  contract  elements  of  offer,  acceptance,  and \nconsideration. See, e.g., Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; \nColumbus Reg’l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338–41. The grantees do \nnot suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the \nInflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive \nmoney from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what \namount.  Those  determinations  were  to  be  made  “on  a \ncompetitive basis” at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. \n42 U.S.C. § 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal \nfunds  only  because  they  were  awarded  discretionary  EPA \ngrants,  the  terms  of  which  are  governed  by  the  grant \nagreements. See Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, \nat *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(explaining that Department of Education “controls” when a \ndistrict court seeks to remedy “the government’s denial of \npreviously awarded discretionary grants”). The dispute over \nthe termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 21 of 92\n21 \nreally at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued \nperformance of the agreements.  \nIn  short,  the  grantees  cannot  circumvent  the  Court  of \nFederal Claims by arguing that EPA’s termination of the grants \nwas arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  \n4. \nFinally,  the  grantees  cannot  bring  their  regulatory  or \narbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that \nthe EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke \nthe Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young \nexception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign \nimmunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \n“powers are limited by statute” and whose actions go “beyond \nthose limitations” or are “constitutionally void.” Larson, 337 \nU.S. at 689, 701–02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, \n621–23  (1963).  The  grantees  insist  Administrator  Zeldin \nexceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in \nviolation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA’s bar \non arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree. \nThe Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra \nvires  exception  to  sovereign  immunity  does  not  apply  to \ncontract claims: “The Government, as representative of the \ncommunity as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any \nplaintiff  who  presents  a  disputed  question  of  property  or \ncontract right.” 337 U.S. at 704. As already explained, the \ngrantees’  regulatory  and  arbitrary  and  capricious  claims \nessentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the \ngrant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these \nclaims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that \nthe government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory \nlimits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 22 of 92\n22 \ninvoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S. at \n695 (squarely rejecting the contention that “an officer given the \npower to make decisions” only has sovereign immunity when \nhe “make[s] correct decisions”).  \nThe grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction \nthrough  the  ultra  vires  exception  to  sovereign  immunity \nbecause their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are \nessentially contractual. \nB. \nThe  grantees  also  maintain  that  EPA  violated  the \n“Separation  of  Powers”  by  not  enforcing  the  Inflation \nReduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. \nCir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how \nand when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations \nwere to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by \ncanceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had \njurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits.  \nAs an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, \nbut rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction \nAct.  Claims  that  agency  officials  acted  in  excess  of  their \nstatutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \n“Separation of Powers.” See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, \n \n9 This is consistent with the general principle that “[i]t is not illegal \nfor a party to breach a contract.” United States v. Blankenship, 382 \nF.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). “The duty to keep a contract at \ncommon law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it[]—and nothing else.” United States v. Winstar Corp., \n518  U.S.  839,  919–20  (1996)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (quoting \nHolmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of \nJustice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 23 of 92\n23 \n474 (1994) (distinguishing between “claims that an official \nexceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims \nthat he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other”); cf. \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency \naction “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity”  and  action  “in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations”). As we recently explained, when a \n“supposed  separation-of-powers  violation  turns  entirely  on \nwhether  [executive]  officials  violated  the  governing \nstatutes, … Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra \nvires one.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-\n5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19–20 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); \nsee also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 \nWL 2326021, at *6–9 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees \nhere allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and \nwe  decline  to  adopt  a  principle  that  would  convert  every \nstatutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.  \nWe conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction \nAct  when  it  terminated  these  grants.  The  grantees  have \nidentified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of \nthe  grants.  In  relevant  part,  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act \n“appropriated  to  the  Administrator”  $20  billion  “to  make \ngrants[] on a competitive basis” and provided that the funds are \n“to remain available until September 30, 2024.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a \nmandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that \nEPA  allegedly  violated  when  it  cancelled  grants  after  the \nSeptember 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the \nstatute  required  EPA  to  obligate  all  $20  billion  by  the \nappropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the \ngrants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator’s discretion \nto  withhold  or  terminate  grants.  And  EPA  repeatedly \nrepresented that it planned to recommit the funds. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 24 of 92\n24 \nThe  grantees  and  the  dissent  insist  EPA’s  promise  to \nrecommit  the  funds  was  hollow  because  the  Inflation \nReduction  Act  appropriation  had  lapsed  by  the  time  EPA \nterminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to \nrecommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the \nproposition  that  when  an  agency  cancels  a  grant  after  an \nappropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds \nrequires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. \nIndeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the \nlongstanding  position  of  the  Government  Accountability \nOffice—a legislative agency—that the Executive Branch may \nissue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has \nlapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. \n158,  158  (Dec.  19,  1988);  see  also  31  U.S.C.  § 1552(a) \n(providing that appropriation account does not close until five \nyears after an appropriation expires).  \nIn fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts \nafter terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller \nGeneral  has  approved  for  decades.10  See  U.S.  General \nAccounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law \n3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28–5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of \nreplacement  contracts  and  associated  Comptroller  General \nopinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be \ninconsistent with this court’s recognition that the government \ngets “a second chance to obligate” even after an appropriation \nhas lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. \nPopulation Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C. Cir. \n1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political \nbranches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that \n \n10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite \nbecause it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See \nDissenting  Op.  41.  Replacement  grants  do  not  require  a  new \nobligation of funds. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 25 of 92\n25 \nthe government lacks authority to recommit the funds after \ntermination.11 \nThe district court’s determination that the grantees were \nlikely to succeed on their “constitutional” Inflation Reduction \nAct claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found \nthat “EPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their \nentirety as a policy matter.” Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. \n3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any \nevidence in the record and rested only on the district court’s \nassertion that EPA “suspended all eight grants.” Id. at 116. But \nthe suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate \nEPA  was  shutting  down  the  statutory  programs  without \ncongressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it \nplanned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight \nand accountability, contradicting the district court’s shutdown \nfinding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA’s \nrepresentations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. \nSee Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d \n723, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nRather than credit EPA’s statements or explain why the \npresumption of regularity was overcome, the district  court \nsimply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The \ncourt  disregarded  the  government’s  interest  in  prudent \nmanagement  of  the  grant  programs  and  the  government’s \nrepresentations that it planned to properly supervise, rather \n \n11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the \nrecent  repeal  of  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund,  and  the \nrecission  of  “unobligated  balances,”  affects  EPA’s  ability  to \nrecommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA \nfrom recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also \nrelieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 26 of 92\n26 \nthan abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court’s \nconclusory  factual  finding  of  program  dismantlement  was \nclearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 \nF.3d 34, 118 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear \nerror review the court is not required to “accept findings that \nare utterly deficient”). \nBecause EPA issued the grants in accordance with the \nInflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency \nsought  to  dismantle  the  programs  without  congressional \napproval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees’ \nclaims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for \nyears  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  flagrantly \ndisregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated \nfunds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with \nits statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257–\n59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the \nappropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with \nany requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. \nEPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its \nconcerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of \ninterest during the award process.  \nEPA’s actions here are well within the Executive Branch’s \nauthority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds \nand to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly \nspent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be \n \n12 The district court also ignored the government’s evidence of \nmismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning “gold bars” \nvideo,  which  further  supports  EPA’s  good  faith in  deciding to \nterminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision \nand accountability. See J.A. 107 n.1. Moreover, the dissent focuses \nprimarily on EPA’s actions against these grantees, but the repeated \nrecounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will \nrecommit the funds through a more robust process. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 27 of 92\n27 \nchallenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in \nthe Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care \nthat the grant programs be faithfully executed. \nThe grantees’ false invocation of the separation of powers \ncannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA \nfrom  carrying  out  basic  executive  functions  to  ensure  the \nprudent  and  effective  management  of  substantial  public \nfunds.13  \nIV. \nThe district court also abused its discretion in applying the \nremaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the \nbalance of the equities, and the public interest. While some \ngrantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the \nlitigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the \ngovernment and the public in the proper stewardship of billions \nof taxpayer dollars. \nA. \nThe  loss  of  grant  funds  during  this  litigation  is  not \nirreparable because the harm is compensable through money \ndamages.  The  district  court  concluded  the  grantees  would \nsuffer irreparable harm because their “purpose” and “business \noperations … depend[] on their grant money.” Climate United \nFund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \n“economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable \nharm.” Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, \n555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be \n \n13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations \nClause  if  it  reobligates  the  funds  after  terminating  the  grant \nagreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction \non this argument, so we do not address it. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 28 of 92\n28 \nredressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. \nWe have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \n“threatens  the  very  existence  of  the  movant’s  business.” \nWisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985).  This  exception  generally  applies  when  government \naction threatens the existence of an independent private entity. \nSee, e.g., Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 \nF.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm \nwhen a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if \nregulatory action took effect during litigation). \nThe  grantees  do  not  fall  within  this  exception.  The \nnonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are \nentities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for \nand spending these federal grants. So while their “existence \nrelies on grant money” as the district court held, that is because \nthese entities were established to benefit from government \nlargesse.  Creating  such  an  entity  cannot  establish  an \nirrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to \ninjunctive  relief  preventing  the  Executive  Branch  from \nsupervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential \nthreat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable \nharm. \nEPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the \nintegrity  of  the  grantmaking  process.  While  litigation  is \npending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations \nor return to the operational status they had before they received \nfederal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is \nreadily compensable through damages and therefore  is not \nirreparable. \nB. \nThe balance of the equities and the public interest factors \nsimilarly  favor  the  government.  The  injunction  harms  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 29 of 92\n29 \ngovernment and the public interest by preventing the Executive \nBranch  from  properly  and  prudently  managing  billions  of \ndollars  in  public  funds.  The  grantees  have  an  interest  in \ncontinued access to government funding. But the government \nand the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public \nfisc and eliminating  the  appearance of impropriety around \nthese grant programs.  \nMoreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to \nbe a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay \ndamages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not \nentirely, redress the grantees’ interim injuries. By contrast, if \nthe government’s position is eventually vindicated, it will have \nno apparent means to recover funds spent down while the \nlitigation has run its course. See Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 \nWL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to \nthe government because the grant “funds cannot be recouped \nand  are  thus  irrevocably  expended”)  (cleaned  up).  The \ngovernment’s  (and  the  public’s)  harm  from  an  erroneous \ninjunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees’ harm \nfrom an erroneous contract termination is not. \nFinally,  Congress  has  explicitly  channeled  breach  of \ngovernment contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and \nlimited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \n(“The Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory \nnor injunctive relief.”) (cleaned up). The district court has no \njurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal \nClaims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public \ninterest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and \nremedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 \nS. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (“When a court concludes that the \nExecutive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for \nthe court to exceed its power, too.”).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 30 of 92\n30 \nThe same considerations support vacating the injunction \nas to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees \nwere likely to succeed on any of their independent claims \nagainst Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, \nand replevin. To the contrary, the court found that “Citibank \nperformed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its \nresponsibilities  as  a  financial  agent  of  the  United  States.” \nClimate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction \nagainst Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following \nthe  government’s  instructions,  which  the  district  court \nconsidered  unlawful.  Because  we  conclude  the  injunction \nagainst  the  government  should  be  vacated,  the  derivative \ninjunction against Citibank must be vacated as well. \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court’s \ninjunction and remand the case to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \nSo ordered. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 31 of 92\n \nPILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:   On the majority’s \ntelling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against \nEPA’s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards.  \nThat version of events fails to contend with the government’s \nactual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs’ claims, leading \nthe majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review \nof the district court’s preliminary injunction.   \nThree years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction \nAct.    One  of  the  law’s  signature  provisions  directs  the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in \ngrants  for  investment  in  projects  to  develop  clean  energy \ninfrastructure  and  manufacturing  capacity.    Congress \nstructured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs \nwhile reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air \nquality,  especially  in  low-income  and  underinvested \ncommunities.  EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of \n2024, as Congress required.   \nAfter  the  change  in  administration,  in  response  to \nPresident Trump’s directives to terminate the “Green New \nDeal,” new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money \nalready awarded to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs were holding and \nspending the money exclusively as Congress intended.  Yet \nEPA—in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of \nJustice,  the  FBI,  and  the  U.S.  Treasury—opened  spurious \ncriminal  and  civil  investigations  into  the  Greenhouse  Gas \nReduction  Fund  and  pressured  Citibank  into  “voluntarily” \nfreezing  Plaintiffs’  accounts  even  though  the  government \nlacked probable cause to impose such a freeze.  EPA then \nattempted to take back Plaintiffs’ money by “terminating” all \neight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally \nmandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in \ndistrict court for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ application for a \ntemporary  restraining  order.    Those  unprecedented  and \nunfounded actions were part of EPA’s hunt for reasons to shut \ndown the congressionally mandated program and claw back the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 32 of 92\n2 \nfunding  that  had  already  been  disbursed  to  Plaintiffs  and \ncommitted to infrastructure projects.  EPA’s termination letter \nclaims the agency conducted a “comprehensive review” but \nfails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by \nPlaintiffs.   \nSo far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access \nto their funding for six months.  The freeze has already caused \nPlaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable \nhousing and energy projects implementing Congress’s vision.  \nEPA has done all that without presenting to any court any \ncredible  evidence  or  coherent  reason  that  could  justify  its \ninterference  with  Plaintiffs’  money  and  its  sabotage  of \nCongress’s law. \nPlaintiffs challenge EPA’s action to gut the Greenhouse \nGas  Reduction  Fund  as  contrary  to  the  Constitution’s \nseparation  of  powers.    Fundamental  to  our  “constitutional \nsystem  of  separation  of  powers”  is  the  “settled,  bedrock \nprinciple[]” that neither the President nor his  “subordinate \nexecutive agencies” may “decline to follow a statutory mandate \nor prohibition simply because of policy objections.”  In re \nAiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C. Cir. 2013); U.S. \nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  Yet that is \njust what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here.  \nThe record strongly supports the district court’s determination \nthat EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of \ndollars’ worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated \nreason  other  than  disagreements  with  Congress’s  policy \ndetermination—grounds  that  are  entirely  inapposite  and \ninadequate, and that the government does not defend here.  The \nagency has no lawful basis—nor even a nonfrivolous assertion \nof  any  basis—to  interfere  with  funding  that,  pursuant  to \nCongress’s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in \nturn have committed it to energy infrastructure development \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 33 of 92\n3 \nand advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress’s \nplan. \nThat  constitutional  violation  alone  justifies  the  district \ncourt’s injunction.  The injunction is independently warranted \nby the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA’s actions.  \nPlaintiffs  challenge  EPA’s  taking  of  their  funds  under  an \nirrational process with only pretextual justifications.  That is a \nquintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and \non which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed. \nDefendants insist that this is a government contract dispute \nthat we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the \nCourt of Federal Claims has authority to decide it.  Our Tucker \nAct precedents do not support that contention.  They direct us \nto analyze whether a claim is “at its essence” contractual and, \nif it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \n“knowledge  of  the  government  contracting  process.”  \nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C. \nCir. 1985).  That analysis, turning on the source of the right \nPlaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek—here, \nconstitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed \nfunds to which they remain lawfully entitled—confirms the \njurisdiction of the district court.  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 \nF.2d  959,  968-69  (D.C.  Cir.  1982).    The  majority \nacknowledges the district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  claims.    And  nothing  in  the  Tucker  Act  or \nbinding precedent interpreting it supports the majority’s view \nthat Plaintiffs’ APA claim is transformed into a contract claim \nand ousted from the district court’s jurisdiction merely because \nit seeks to prevent EPA’s capricious interference with funds \nthat Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently \nwith a contract.  Maj. Op. 16-18. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 34 of 92\n4 \nIn characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute \nsubject to the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional bar, the majority \nbaselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these \nimportant claims.  The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot \nbring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government \naction  that  affects  something  of  value  that  was  originally \nobtained by contract.  Maj. Op. 16-18.  Doing so undercuts the \nConstitution’s  and  the  APA’s  checks  on  the  Executive’s \nillegitimate  seizure  of  Plaintiffs’  funds  and  subversion  of \nCongress’s will.  The government’s Tucker Act defense is \nespecially pernicious here.  Dismissal of this case presumably \nwill enable the government to carry out its announced plan to \nimmediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs’ funds.  At best, in \nthe unlikely event the government refrains from immediately \ndraining Plaintiffs’ frozen accounts, the further delay involved \nin reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will \nitself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot \nmove  forward  and  may  fail  without  funding.    In  these \ncircumstances,  “[i]t  is  no  overstatement  to  say  that  our \nconstitutional  system  of  separation  of  powers  w[ill]  be \nsignificantly altered” by “allow[ing] executive . . . agencies to \ndisregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case.”  \nAiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \nIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act.  The \nAct establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nto distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy \nsolar and electric energy technology throughout the country, \nespecially  in  low-income  and  disadvantaged  communities.  \nPub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 35 of 92\n5 \nat 42 U.S.C. § 7434).  The program was intended to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and “improve \nhealth outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality \njobs for Americans—all while strengthening [the] country’s \neconomic  competitiveness  and  ensuring  energy  security.”  \nNotice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A. 1735).   \nAchieving  that  vision  would  “require  a  tremendous \namount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- \nand air pollution-reducing projects across the country.”  Id.  \nBecause the private sector has historically been hesitant to \ninvest  in  clean  energy  projects,  Congress  designed  the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund  to  finance  clean  energy \nprojects “in partnership with, and by leveraging investment \nfrom,  the  private  sector.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434(c)(3)(A).  \nSpecifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by \nSeptember 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which \nin turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment \nfor clean energy programs or to assist community projects to \nreduce air pollution.  Id. § 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3). \nPursuant  to  Congress’s  directive,  in  July  2023,  EPA \ncreated two funding programs: the National Clean Investment \nFund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders \nto use public seed money to attract private investment for tens \nof  thousands  of  energy-efficient  affordable  housing, \ntransportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; \nand the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) \nprogram, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use \npublic seed money to enable community lenders to invest in \nclean  energy  projects  in  low-income  and  underinvested \ncommunities.   \nEPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, \nwhich included review of applicants’ detailed program plans \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 36 of 92\n6 \nand budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing \nthird-party  capital  and  financial  risk.    EPA  selected  eight \nnonprofits—lenders  and  community  organizations—capable \nof carrying out those aims.  The approved workplans and \nbudgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those \norganizations  will  use  the  federal  funds  they  have  since \nreceived to expand access to—and recruit private investment \nfor—affordable  construction  and  renovation  of  energy-\nefficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare \nfacilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in \nrural, Tribal, and low-income areas.  \nIn compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress \nimposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by \nthe summer of 2024.  To enable the grantees to recruit private \ninvestment—as  Congress  required,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 7434(c)(3)(A)—EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts \nopened in the grantees’ names at Citibank.  Unlike EPA’s \ntraditional  disbursement  system,  that  structure  gave  the \ngrantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, \nallowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely \non to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private \ninvestments.  See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14. \nThe Plaintiff grantees’ legal title to their award funds is \nspelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, \nCitibank, and each grantee.  Those agreements specify that \nCitibank “maintains the Accounts for the [grantee]” and state \nthat the grantee is “the Bank’s customer with respect to the \nAccounts  and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all \nfinancial assets credited . . . to the Accounts.”  Account Control \nAgreement § 1 (J.A. 1144).  The Account Control Agreements \naccordingly  direct  that  Citibank  “shall  comply  with  all \ninstructions” it receives from the grantees.  Id. § 2 (J.A. 1145).  \nThe grantees’ title to the award funds is also reflected in \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 37 of 92\n7 \nCitibank’s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which \nrequires Citibank to act as the government’s “financial agent” \nto achieve Congress’s goal by, among other things, establishing \n“accounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant \nrecipients” and maintaining a “customer relationship” with \neach grantee.  Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A § I.A.1 \n(J.A. 2145). \nUnder those agreements, EPA retained a security interest \nin the grantees’ award funds that allows it to assert control over \nthe money in certain circumstances if—and only if—it issues a \nNotice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not \ndone.  Form of Notice of Exclusive Control (J.A. 1152); Oral \nArg.  Tr.  28:6-22.    EPA  has  only  an  unexercised  security \ninterest; it does not own the funds in the grantees’ accounts.  \nSee United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S. 198, 209-10 \n(1983); Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 392 n.8 \n(2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting the distinction between \n“the government possess[ing] merely a secured interest in the \nproperty” and “own[ing] the funds”). \nIn addition to serving as the mechanism for conveying to \nthe grantees legal title to the award funds, the financial agent \nstructure affords EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of \nthe  funds  than  it  would  have  had  under  the  default \ndisbursement system:  While EPA’s traditional disbursement \nsystem reports only the amounts withdrawn by the recipient \nand the remaining award funds, the financial agent structure \nallows EPA real-time “view access,” enabling it to see the \ngrantees’ and their subrecipients’ accounts to follow how much \nthey are spending, with all amounts broken down by budget \ncategory, and to see income in the form of portfolio earnings \nand loan repayments.  Bafford Decl. ¶ 33 (J.A. 372).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 38 of 92\n8 \nOther  oversight  mechanisms  provide  further,  detailed \nconfirmation of grantees’ lawful use of their funds.  Grantees \nprovide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending.  They \nmake  quarterly,  semi-annual,  and  annual  written  reports \nregarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-\napproved  workplans,  plus  quarterly  conflict-of-interest \nreporting.  They attend oversight, planning, and compliance \nmeetings with EPA at least weekly.  They submit to EPA \nwithdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw \nrequest to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan.  And \ngrantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and \naudits for federal grant compliance.  Id. ¶ 35 (J.A. 372-73). \nThe plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and \nCCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees.  Since \nmid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, \ncommitting to loans for projects around the country that will, \nfor example:  \n•  develop  and  renovate  hundreds  of  energy-efficient \naffordable housing units;  \n•  fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners \nto finance heating and cooling systems and backup \nbattery storage;  \n•  build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to \nbe conveniently and affordably available for lease by \nsmall businesses and independent contractors; and  \n•  provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to \nreduce the risks of harm to patients due to power \noutages.   \nThose projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and \nsmall  businesses,  create  jobs,  ameliorate  the  affordable-\n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 39 of 92\n9 \nhousing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less \ndeveloped communities.   \nPlaintiffs’  projects  provide  benefits  to  people  and \ncommunities the value of which is many times greater than \ntheir  cost  to  the  public  fisc.    Congress  structured  these \nprograms to enable each dollar of public funding spent to \nattract multiple dollars of private funding.  One Plaintiff, for \nexample, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private \ninvestment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects.  \nAnother Plaintiff’s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of \nprivate investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to \nthe Plaintiff.  As of December 2024, it had already achieved a \nprivate-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1.  But \nthose projects—as well as many of the Plaintiffs’ ability even \nto  remain  in  business—cannot  continue  without  Plaintiffs’ \naccess  to  the  funds  EPA  awarded  them.    Plaintiffs’ \nvulnerability  to  the  freeze  of  their  federal  grant  money  is \nparticularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed \nspecifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do \nnot have other sources of funding.   \nB.  EPA’s Actions \nEPA’s campaign to seize the grant money already owned \nby Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took \noffice, in response to its directives.  On January 20, 2025, \nPresident Trump issued Executive Order 14154.  Exec. Order \n14154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 29, 2025).  Section 7 of \nthe Executive Order, entitled “Terminating the Green New \nDeal,”  directs  “[a]ll  agencies”  to  “immediately  pause  the \ndisbursement  of  funds  appropriated  through  the  Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022.”  Id.  Reacting to the E.O., EPA froze \n“all disbursements for unliquidated obligations funded by . . . \nthe Inflation Reduction Act”—i.e., legally binding funding \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 40 of 92\n10 \ncommitments that had not yet been disbursed.

U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 778 F. Supp. 3d 440, 479 \n(D.R.I. 2025); New York v. Trump, 769 F. Supp. 3d 119, 146-\n47 (D.R.I. 2025); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. \n& Budget, 775 F. Supp. 3d 100, 130-31 (D.D.C. 2025)—EPA \ncould not freeze the funds that Congress had appropriated for \nthe NCIF and CCIA programs because those funds had already \nbeen  given  to  Plaintiffs  and  were  held  in  their  Citibank \naccounts.  Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made \nclear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those \nprograms.   \nOn February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video \nin which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \n“scheme” by the “Biden EPA” to “park[]” 20 billion dollars at \nan outside financial institution in order to “obligate all of the \nmoney in a rush job with reduced oversight.”  Lee Zeldin \n(@EPALeeZeldin),  X  (Feb.  12,  2025,  7:52  PM), \nhttps://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP.  Zeldin asserted that the bank \n“must immediately return” the money in Plaintiffs’ Citibank \naccounts so that EPA could “reassume responsibility” over the \nfunds.  Id.  He also vowed to refer the grant programs for \ninvestigation by EPA’s Office of the Inspector General and the \nJustice  Department  to  redress  “[t]he  days  of  irresponsibly \nshoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the \nname of environmental justice and climate equity.”  Id.  The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 41 of 92\n11 \nnext day, EPA issued a press release repeating those statements \nand  reiterating  that  “Administrator  Zeldin  is  calling  for \ntermination  of  the  financial  agent  agreement,  and  for  the \nimmediate return of the entire fund balance to the United States \nTreasury  to  ensure  EPA  oversight.”    Press  Release,  EPA, \nAdministrator  Zeldin  Announces  that  Billions  of  Dollars \nWorth of “Gold Bars” Have Been Located at Outside Financial \nInstitution (Feb. 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/48VN-PLYE. \nFive days later, the Department of Justice took up Zeldin’s \ncause, seeking to use its criminal prosecutorial powers to cut \noff Plaintiffs’ access to their funds despite the lack of probable \ncause to do so.  The Justice Department first asked the Chief of \nthe  Criminal  Division  of  the  Washington,  D.C.,  U.S. \nAttorney’s  Office,  Denise  Cheung,  to  open  a  criminal \ninvestigation into whether the NCIF and CCIA grants had been \n“unlawfully” awarded, so that the government could prevent \nthe “contract awardees [from] continu[ing] to draw down” their \nfunds from their Citibank accounts.  Read the Resignation \nLetter by Denise Cheung, A Veteran D.C. Federal Prosecutor, \nWASH. POST (Feb. 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/8NMY-DRWE.  \nWhen Cheung informed the Justice Department that probable \ncause to open a grand jury investigation did not exist, the \nJustice Department asked her to instead issue a letter requesting \nthat Citibank freeze Plaintiffs’ funds.   \nWhile Cheung worked in coordination with the FBI to \ndraft the freeze request letter to Citibank, she informed the \nJustice Department that the government lacked probable cause \nto believe that Plaintiffs’ accounts were subject to government \nseizure.  Id.  The FBI, too, expressed “concern about the current \nlack of evidence of any apparent crime and the need to send out \nany such freeze letter.”  Id.  Despite that advice, the FBI sent \nthe freeze letter to Citibank that night, “recommend[ing]” that \nCitibank freeze each of the NCIF and CCIA grantees’ and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 42 of 92\n12 \nsubgrantees’ accounts for 30 days.  FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A. 99-\n103).   \nShortly after the letter went out, then-U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict  of  Columbia,  Ed  Martin,  directed  Cheung  to \nimmediately send a second letter to Citibank ordering—rather \nthan  merely  recommending—that  it  freeze  the  accounts \npursuant to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.  \nWhen Cheung explained that the evidence was insufficient to \nsupport such a letter, she was asked to resign for refusing to \nsend the letter.  She resigned the next day. \nUndeterred, Martin personally submitted a seizure warrant \napplication  to  a  D.C.  magistrate  judge.    Spencer  S.  Hsu, \nMaxine Joselow & Nicolás Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe \namid Pushback from Judge, Prosecutors, WASH. POST (Feb. \n27, 2025), https://perma.cc/E2JR-G4GF.  The judge rejected \nthe seizure warrant application as unsupported by probable \ncause.  Id.  Around the same time, the Deputy Attorney General \nasked at least one other U.S. Attorney’s office to open a grand \njury investigation into the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and \nseek a court-ordered bank freeze, but, like Cheung, those other \nprosecutors refused the requests as unsupported.  Id.  As the \ngovernment eventually told the district court, the “effort to . . . \nput  a  criminal  freeze  on  the  money”  was  “obviously” \nunsuccessful “because that didn’t happen.”  Mar. 12 TRO Hr’g \nTr. 26:5-9 (J.A. 199).  \nDespite  having  received  multiple,  independent \nassessments that there was no probable cause to believe that \n“any apparent crime” had been committed in connection with \nPlaintiffs’ funds, EPA continued without basis to press for \ninvestigations  of  Plaintiffs,  and  then  pointed  to  the  very \nexistence of those investigations as if they supported its efforts \nto indefinitely prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 43 of 92\n13 \nEPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator Chad McIntosh referred \nthe “GGRF program” to the EPA Office of Inspector General \nfor a “full investigation” into what he termed a “pattern of \nreckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, \nastonishing  sums  of  tax  dollars  awarded  to  unqualified \nrecipients,  and  severe  deficiencies  in  regulatory  oversight \nunder the prior administration.”  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG 2 (J.A. \n107).  Fifteen minutes after sending the referral letter, in an act \nof  arrant  bootstrapping,  McIntosh  forwarded  the  letter  to \nCitibank with a baseless cover email characterizing the GGRF \nprogram  as  being  “riddled  with  self-dealing,  conflicts  of \ninterest,  extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients,  improperly \nreduced government oversight, and much more.”  Mar. 2 EPA \nLtr. to Citibank (J.A. 105). \nMeanwhile, Citibank continued to block disbursements of \nPlaintiffs’ funds.  But—given the government’s lack of success \nin convincing any prosecutor or  court that probable cause \nexisted  to  support  a  criminal  freeze—that  was  only  a \n“voluntar[y] pause[]” pursuant to the FBI’s “recommendation” \nfrom two weeks earlier.  Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. \n106).  To ensure that Citibank continued the freeze, EPA asked \nTreasury to instruct Citibank “not to disburse funds from any \nof the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, \nMarch 9, 2025.”  Mar. 4 Treasury Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 111); \nsee also Opp’n to Mot. for TRO 7, Climate United Fund v. \nCitibank, No. 25-cv-698, Dkt.

The Justice Department \nofficials  admitted  that  those  investigations  had  not \n“uncover[ed] . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties” that \ncould justify the government’s interference with Plaintiffs’ \nmoney but advised that, before the government would have to \ndefend the freeze in court, it would “make . . . arguments about \nhow those claims sound in contract and should be pursued in \nanother forum.”  Id. \nThe Justice Department recognized that, “[a]t some point, \nwe will need to raise  defenses, but the criminal and civil \ninvestigations may fill that out over the intervening period.”  Id.  \nThat is, in the Justice Department’s candid estimation, the \ngovernment had not turned up any wrongdoing that could \njustify its action to “prevent disbursement of the grant funds.”  \nId.  Rather, it pursued criminal and civil investigations in the \nhopes of uncovering “criminal conduct or other improprieties” \nthat could justify freezing Plaintiffs’ accounts. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 45 of 92\n15 \nIn response to the Justice Department’s instructions, EPA \nsent a letter to Citibank the next day instructing it to “pause the \nprocessing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts \nuntil further notice.”  Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 65).  \nEPA  stated  that  it  was  “working  to  review  and  develop \nadditional  account  controls  to  address  concerns  regarding \npotential  fraud  and/or  conflicts  of  interest  related  to  the \n[GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight \nquestions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,” \nand asserted that “[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing \ncriminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an \ninvestigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG).”  \nId.    EPA  advised  Citibank  that,  until  “additional  account \ncontrols are developed and implemented . . . and given the \nongoing investigations into the GGRF, it is critical that the \nBank  not  resume  processing  payment  instructions  for  the \nGGRF accounts.”  Id.  EPA stated further that “[t]his interim \naccount  control  will  be  rescinded  as  soon  as  reasonably \npracticable once EPA completes its review and implements \nadditional account controls through additional instructions as \nnecessary.”  Id.   \nMeanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access \nthe money in their bank accounts for over two weeks—a period \nthat has now stretched to more than six months.  And because \nthe terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs \nfrom withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the \nfollowing fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run \nout of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and \npay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT \nsecurity  services.    On  top  of  that,  without  access  to  their \nfunding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments \nunder loans for projects they had already agreed to finance.  \nSome of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers \nat any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 46 of 92\n16 \nPlaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be \nforced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.   \nPlaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their \naccounts.  They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA \nor Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible.  They \nreceived no substantive reply.  Climate United, for example, \nsent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy \nletter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before \nfinally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \n“received  [Climate  United’s]  correspondence”  and  was \n“awaiting further guidance” from EPA.  Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 42-\n51 (J.A. 376-78).  When Climate United contacted EPA on \nFebruary 20, the  agency at first offered Climate United  a \nmeeting the following week, only to reschedule the meeting \nthree times before cancelling it and becoming entirely non-\nresponsive to Climate United’s efforts to get in touch.   \nAt the same time that EPA was refusing to respond to \nPlaintiffs’  requests  for  information,  Zeldin  made  multiple \npublic statements in which he claimed to have “seen [] a lot of \nself-dealing,  a  lot  of  conflicts  of  interest,”  described  the \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a “clear-cut case of waste \nand abuse” and a “criminal” scheme, and vowed that EPA was \n“not going to rest” until it had “recover[ed]” the grant awards.1 \nAfter three weeks of being kept in the dark without access \nto their funds, Plaintiffs “had no choice but to sue.”  Mar. 12 \nTRO Hr’g Tr. 14:8 (J.A. 187).

Climate United Fund \nv. Citibank, 775 F. Supp. 3d 335, 343 (D.D.C. 2025); J.A. 390-\n91 (termination letter).  The government then argued that the \ncase should be dismissed as moot because the relief Plaintiffs \nsought—an injunction preventing EPA from terminating the \nawards—was  no  longer  available,  as  EPA  had  already \npurported to terminate the awards.   \nRejecting EPA’s attempt to moot the case, the district \ncourt granted a temporary restraining order.  It found that EPA \nhad failed to provide any logical explanation for terminating \nPlaintiffs’ grant awards.  Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at \n346-48.  Instead, in declarations and two live hearings before \nthe district court, EPA cited allegations of criminal activity and \nfraud that the court held were unsupported by any credible \nevidence.  Id. at 347-48; see also id. at 346 (“EPA Defendants \nproffered no evidence to support their basis for the termination \n. . . .”).  Rather than proffer any credible evidence, EPA merely \npointed to the ongoing investigations by EPA’s Office of the \nInspector General, the Department of Justice, and the FBI—\neach  of  which  EPA  had  instigated  based  on  the  same \nunsubstantiated allegations for which it could not provide any \ncredible evidence to the district court.

And I \nstill don’t.  I mean, here we are weeks in, and as far as I—\nyou’re still unable to proffer me any information with regard to \nany kind of investigation, malfeasance.”).   \nIn fact, once it had to answer in court, EPA abandoned its \nprevious arguments that the terminations were necessary due \nto  “substantial  concerns  regarding  program  integrity”  and \n“programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse.”  Opp’n to Mot. for \nTRO  21.    Instead,  EPA  maintained  that  its  “bases  for \ntermination were the grants’ structure and terms” and that its \ntermination decision “reflected no more than a decision based \non  reasons  of  policy,”  not  anything  to  do  with  Plaintiffs’ \n“noncompliance” or “conduct.”  Opp’n to PI 34-35, 38 (J.A. \n503-04,  507)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also \nClimate United, 778 F.

Id at 115-16. \nBy  the  time  the  district  court  granted  the  preliminary \ninjunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs’ inability to access their \nfunding  threatened  to  permanently  unravel  projects  that \ndepended on funding commitments they had incurred before \nEPA’s actions to undo the GGRF.  A project to renovate 192 \naffordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in \ncommitted Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD)  funding  if  a  subgrantee  cannot  fulfill  its  funding \nobligations by September.  Donovan Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 437-38).  \nProjects to construct a community health center in New Jersey \nand to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in \nrural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse \nif they did not receive a subgrantee’s planned funding by July.  \nMoon Decl. ¶¶ 19, 25-26 (J.A. 465-67).  And construction of \n302  affordable  housing  units  in  Texas  and  236  units  in \nMaryland will not move forward, and will eventually collapse, \nwithout a subgrantee’s committed funding.  Donovan Decl. \n¶ 17 (J.A. 436-37). \nThose harms have only continued to mount as the funding \nfreeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already \ntoo late.  Due to one subgrantee’s inability to access its grant \nfunds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state \ntax credits in May, increasing the project’s cost and placing the \nproject in jeopardy.  Mayopoulos Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Climate United, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 50 of 92\n20 \nNo. 25-cv-698,  Dkt.  No.  112-1  (D.D.C.  May  12,  2025) \n(hereinafter Mayopoulos Supp. Decl.).  Another project to \nconstruct a 160-home subsidized rental apartment community \nin Detroit most likely lost its critical HUD housing assistance \ncommitment because of a subgrantee’s inability to provide a \npromised $4 million bridge loan in June.  Id. at ¶¶ 7-8; Brown \nDecl. ¶ 18 (J.A. 437).  And a $34 million project to build 90 \nrental homes in Texas was projected to fall through due to a \nsubgrantee’s inability to provide its $3.6 million of committed \nfunding by the end of June.  Moon Decl. ¶¶ 20-21 (J.A. 465). \nIn  addition  to  undermining  existing  projects,  EPA’s \nactions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of \nbusiness, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress \nintended  them  to  fund.    Without  access  to  their  funding, \nPlaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep \ncurrent on their rent.  Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-\n20.  Due to EPA’s interference with Plaintiffs’ ability to make \npayroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, \nleft voluntarily, or been laid off.  For instance, one Plaintiff has \nlaid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its \nsubgrantees was “forced to act financially as though the GGRF \naward  does  not  exist”  by  laying  off  36  of  its  employees.  \nMayopoulos Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.  And because Plaintiffs cannot \npay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw \nessential  services,  including  critical  accounting,  financial \nmanagement, and award compliance services.  Simply put, \nwithout access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors \nopen, much less honor their loan commitments.   \nMore harmful still, faced with EPA’s threats to claw back \nPlaintiffs’  funds,  existing  partners  have  begun  to  shun \nPlaintiffs’ funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and \nstopping working on Plaintiffs’ projects.  After eight weeks of \nnegotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 51 of 92\n21 \nhad agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all \nthat  was  left  to  officially  close  the  deal  was  the  board’s \napproval.    Following  EPA’s  actions,  the  board  refused  to \napprove  the  loan.    That  same  plaintiff  had  completed \nnegotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help \nfinance  a  different  project,  with  only  board  approval \noutstanding.  The board met the day after Zeldin’s February 12 \ncomments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin’s \npublic  threats  and  vow  to  end  the  NCIF  program.    A \nphilanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a \npartnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions \nfollowing EPA’s actions.  Co-investment and collaboration is \ncritical to Plaintiffs’ ability to carry out Congress’s directive to \nefficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \n“greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in \npartnership  with,  and  by  leveraging  investment  from,  the \nprivate sector.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(3)(A). \nDISCUSSION \nAn  accurate  understanding  of  the  program  Congress \nenacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support \nEPA’s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight \nof  federal  expenditures,  confirms  that  the  district  court’s \ndecision to preliminarily enjoin EPA’s unlawful actions is \nunassailable.  Based on nothing more than the President’s \nannounced  vendetta  against  the  “Green  New  Deal,”  EPA \ndetermined  to  cut  off  access  to  money  that  was  already \ndisbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using—pursuant to \nCongress’s explicit directions as implemented by EPA—to \nexpand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, \nbuildings, and power generation.  The Constitution does not \nallow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to \nunilaterally  decide  to  take  back  money  that  Congress  has \nappropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 52 of 92\n22 \nbecause  the  Executive  Branch  disagrees  with  Congress’s \npolicy choices.  Neither do the laws governing federal agencies \nallow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes \nof  digging  up  pretextual  justifications  to  cover  up  that \nunconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of \nthose investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs’ lawful use of \ntheir money. \nEPA’s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly \ncontests  them.    And  the  imminent,  irreversible  harm  to \nPlaintiffs is incontrovertible.  These circumstances cry out for \npreliminary  injunctive  relief,  as  the  district  court  rightly \nrecognized.  The majority’s contrary conclusion accepts the \ngovernment’s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over \nthe  government’s  blatant  violations  of  basic  principles  of \nconstitutional and administrative law.   \nPlaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant \nawards.  Absent EPA’s unjustified interference, the money in \nPlaintiffs’ accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the \nterms of the funding agreement.  The government has expressly \nand repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have \nviolated those terms.  Neither has EPA attempted to regain \ncontrol  of  the  money  by  asserting  its  security  interest  in \nPlaintiffs’ funds.   \nEPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the \ngrant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported \nallegations.  Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA’s actions as arbitrary \nand capricious, and based on pretextual justifications.  In no \nway is that claim “in essence” a contract claim over which the \ndistrict court lacks jurisdiction.  The  reality that Plaintiffs \nobtained the funds by government contract does not mean that \nclaims they raise against the government’s interference with \ntheir lawful use of those funds sound in contract.  Our binding \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 53 of 92\n23 \nprecedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs “would have \nno  claims  to  assert”  if  they  had  never  received  the  funds \nthrough a grant does not mean that they assert a “contract \nright.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 \nF.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2022).   \nThe court’s holding to the contrary is unsupportable.  The \ncourt falls short today in its Article III duty to independently \nsay what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to \naccount.  Such “[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the \nconstitutional design.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nA.  Likelihood of Success \n1. APA \nEPA’s conduct is arbitrary and capricious.  Agencies may \nnot offer “contrived reasons” for their decisions, Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any \ndecision that “runs counter to the evidence before the agency, \nor is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference \nin view or the product of agency expertise,” Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983).  It is beyond dispute that an agency’s own \npatently  unfounded  criminal  investigations  against  private \ncompanies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless \nand legally unauthorized taking of the companies’ funds.  By \nall indications, that is exactly what EPA did here. \nFollowing the President’s instructions to cut off funding to \nclean energy projects, EPA vowed to “reassume responsibility” \nof the NCIF and CCIA grant funds.  To that end, without \nprobable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to \nthe grant programs, EPA—in coordination with the Justice \nDepartment  and  the  FBI—first  pressured  Citibank  into \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 54 of 92\n24 \nvoluntarily  freezing  Plaintiffs’  accounts  by  referring  to \n“possible  criminal  violations,”  including  “[c]onspiracy  to \ndefraud the United States” and “wire fraud.”  FBI Freeze Ltr. \n(J.A. 99-101).  Not satisfied that Citibank’s voluntary freeze \nwould  hold,  the  agencies  attempted  to  open  a  criminal \ninvestigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs’ \nfunds based on suspected criminal conduct.  When those efforts \ncame  to  nothing,  EPA  instructed  the  agency’s  Office  of \nInspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately \nsent the referral—including its unfounded allegations of “self-\ndealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified \nrecipients,” J.A. 105—to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to \nkeep  the  accounts  frozen  until  EPA  was  able  to  establish \nsufficient account controls.   \nWhen  that  account  freeze  expired,  the  agencies  again \nreferenced “potential fraud” and ongoing criminal and civil \ninvestigations  to  Citibank  as  support  for  an  indefinite \ncontinuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to \nevaluate Plaintiffs’ responses to its oversight questions.  Mar. \n10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 65).  But the very next day—\nweeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before \na hearing on Climate United’s TRO motion—EPA used the 24-\nhour delay, which it had requested as a “professional courtesy,” \nto abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF \nand CCIA awards.  EPA then argued that the court should \ndismiss Climate United’s suit as moot on the ground that EPA \nhad terminated its grant.   \nWhen EPA could not point the court to any evidence \nsupporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. \nSupp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune.  EPA argued to the \ndistrict court and then to us that it terminated the grants not \nbecause any “particular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act \nthat constitutes fraud,” but only because of “EPA’s lack of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 55 of 92\n25 \noversight tools to ensure that the money wasn’t abused.”  Oral \nArg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr’g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A. \n868).  EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any \nway depend on Plaintiffs’ “noncompliance” or “conduct”—\ndespite the termination letters’ references to “fraud, waste, and \nabuse” as a basis for the termination.  PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. \n503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A. 390). \nEach of those actions is consistent with EPA’s unlawful \npursuit of a “short-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of \nthe grant funds” that had nothing to do with any valid concerns \nabout  fraud  or  oversight,  and  everything  to  do  with  the \nagency’s desire to carry out President Trump’s directive to \nblock  implementation  of  Congress’s  environmental  policy.  \nMar.  9  Emails,  https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA.    That  is \ndemonstrated most clearly by EPA’s pursuit of criminal and \ncivil investigations that it hoped would “uncover . . . criminal \nconduct or other improprieties” to substantiate its asserted \njustifications for freezing Plaintiffs’ funds.  Id.  It pursued those \nbaseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at \nleast two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted \nand the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable \ncause to believe any improper conduct had occurred. \nEqually revealing is EPA’s double-speak:  EPA claimed \npublicly and in communications to the parties that its actions \nwere justified because the program is a “criminal” scheme and \na “clear-cut case of waste and abuse” that is “riddled with self-\ndealing,  conflicts  of  interest,  extraordinarily  unqualified \nrecipients . . . and much more,” even as EPA insisted to the \ndistrict court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate \nthose allegations, and to our court, that it was not “accusing” \nand has never “accuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and \nabuse.”  Apr. 2 PI Hr’g 39:12-13 (J.A. 868); Oral Arg. Tr. \n27:15-18.    Such  shifting  and  contradictory  representations \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 56 of 92\n26 \nfurther show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its \nsole  basis  for  terminating  the  awards  are  post-hoc  and \npretextual.  Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21. \nThe timing of the termination letters similarly undermines \nEPA’s purported oversight concerns.  Only the day before \nterminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \n“voluntary”  funding  freeze  while  it  waited  for  Plaintiffs’ \nresponses to its oversight questions—answers it claimed to \nneed in order to evaluate “concerns regarding potential fraud \nand/or conflicts of interest.”  Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. \n65).  Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to \nprevent  EPA  from  terminating  the  awards,  among  other \nrequested relief.  Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs’ responses to \nits  oversight  questions—which  EPA  had  given  Plaintiffs \nanother several weeks to submit—EPA abruptly terminated the \ngrants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court’s \nscheduled TRO hearing.    \nThat  sequence  of  events—terminate  first,  gather  data \nlater—is emblematic of EPA’s approach throughout the events \nunderlying this litigation.  It is fundamentally at odds with the \nAPA’s requirement of reasoned decision making.  An agency \nmust, at a minimum, “examine the relevant data and articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nBy EPA’s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards \nbefore gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided \nto freeze Plaintiffs’ money and launch criminal investigations \nwithout any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \n“criminal conduct or other improprieties.”  Mar. 9 Emails.  At \nevery  turn,  EPA’s  actions  demonstrate  that  its  purported \nreasons for terminating the grant—its “substantial concerns \nregarding  program  integrity,  the  award  progress,  [and] \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 57 of 92\n27 \nprogrammatic  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,”  Gov.  Br.  33—are \nentirely pretextual.  Deciding the outcome before investigating \nthe facts, unleashing the government’s prosecutorial power on \nprivate citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred \nand,  having  uncovered  no  evidence,  giving  contrived  and \ncontradictory  reasons  for  predetermined  and  unsupported \nagency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious.  See \nDep’t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.   \nEPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability \nto  ensure  that  the  grant  funds  were  being  spent  lawfully, \nmaking  its  decision  to  suddenly  terminate  the  awards \nreasonable.  Gov. Br. 33-34.  But the oversight issues it cites \nare contradicted by the record.  EPA’s explanation not only \n“runs counter to the evidence before the agency” and “is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view \nor the product of agency expertise,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43, but is patently pretextual.   \nEPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the \ndistribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and \nmodification  of  the  agreement  between  the  presidential \nelection and inauguration as raising “serious concerns” about \nEPA’s ability to oversee Plaintiffs’ use of the funds.  Gov. Br. \n9-11.  From EPA’s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded \nenormous  sums  of  federal  grant  funding  with  virtually  no \noversight.  That narrative finds no support in the record. \nStart  with  EPA’s  allegation  that  Plaintiffs  are \n“extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients”  who  “had  no  prior \ntrack record.”  Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 105); Gov. Br. \n6.    That  is  a  grave  mischaracterization.    Recipients  were \ncoalitions of some of the country’s most reputable nonprofits \nwith decades of relevant experience.  They formed coalitions, \nstructured as newly formed subsidiaries, to accommodate the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 58 of 92\n28 \ndemands of the role that Congress envisioned for the grantees.  \nThat organizational design enables the subsidiary to adopt \npolicies and structures most conducive to leveraging private \ncapital—one of Congress’s key goals for the program—while \nbenefitting from the experience and infrastructure of the parent \norganizations.

Climate United, \nfor instance, is a coalition of three nonprofits with thirty to fifty \nyears of experience each who have collectively managed nearly \n$30  billion  of  private  and  institutional  capital  to  increase \nenvironmental  sustainability.    Id.  ¶ 7  (J.A.  363).    Power \nForward  Communities  is  a  coalition  of  five  nonprofits—\nincluding household names like United Way and Habitat for \nHumanity—with more than a century of combined experience \nfinancing, managing,  and implementing affordable housing \nprojects.  Its coalition partners’ past projects total more than \n$100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 \nmillion affordable homes and apartments across the United \nStates for Americans in need.  Mayopoulos Decl. ¶ 3 (J.A. \n452).   \nThose coalitions are led by people of proven experience \nand integrity.  Power Forward Communities itself is led by a \nformer  President  and  CEO  of  Fannie  Mae  who  was  also \nGeneral Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is \nled by a former director of the U.S. Office of Management and \nBudget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is \nled by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also \nserved as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco.    Such  impressive  leadership  and  proven  track \nrecords  make  the  coalitions  eminently  suited  to  fulfill \nCongress’s objectives.  It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate \nthat  the  coalition  structure  implies  Plaintiffs’  lack  of \nqualifications when it is “common practice for established \norganizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and \nprograms”; coalition applicants were specifically invited to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 59 of 92\n29 \napply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their \nleaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant \nawards.  Bafford Decl. ¶ 8 (J.A. 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A. 1738).  \nNothing in the record materially disputes any of that.     \nNor  do  EPA’s  purported  concerns  about  conflicts  of \ninterest hold water.  Start with the example selected by the \nmajority.  Maj. Op. 6 & n.2.  The majority highlights that, in \nurging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation \ninto the grant program, EPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator \nalleged that “Jahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, \npersonally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, \nthe Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]—without recusing \nhimself.”  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. 107).  But the record \nsquarely contradicts that allegation.  Consistent with “EPA \nOrder 5700.5A1, EPA’s Policy for Competition of Assistance \nAgreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest \nreview carried out by EPA during the review and selection \nprocess for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from \nreviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any \ngrant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted \nan application.”  Hopson Decl. ¶ 22 (J.A. 421).  That is, in \naddition  to  recusing  himself  from  CGC’s  application  for \nfunding, “Mr. Wise did not even review applications from \nCGC’s  competitors  for  GGRF  funds.”    Id.    Even  EPA \nrecognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does \nnot support its termination decision.  Indeed, after failing to \npresent the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts \nof interest, or anything even approaching “waste, fraud, and \nabuse,” EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the \ngrants was solely “based on reasons of policy” and did not have \nanything to do with Plaintiffs’ “noncompliance” or “conduct.”  \nPI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 60 of 92\n30 \nEPA’s characterization of the grants’ funding structure as \nan “unusual and apparently improper” “scheme [to] remove[] \n$20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, \nand  months  before  a  new  administration  took  office”  is \nsimilarly unfounded.  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. 107).  As \nexplained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum \npayments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a \nsecurity interest held by EPA.  That financial structure was \nspecifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress’s \ndirective  to  act  “in  partnership  with,  and  by  leveraging \ninvestment from, the private sector.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(3).  \nIf the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean \nenergy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or \noffering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for \nprivate investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs’ own assets \nand reflected on their balance sheets as such.  See Impact \nFinance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 29, 32 \n(J.A.  370-72).    Under  EPA’s  standard  grant  disbursement \nsystem, in contrast, a recipient’s balance sheet reflects only the \nportions of the award that have already been expended, rather \nthan the full award amount.  Adherence to the agency’s default \npayment  system  would  have  impeded  Plaintiffs’  ability  to \nrecruit private capital.  To effectuate Congress’s direction, EPA \ninstead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts \nopened in Plaintiffs’ and their subgrantees’ names.  That way, \ntheir balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs’ ownership of the full \namount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the \naccount  only  as  needed  and  in  compliance  with  their \nobligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.   \nThat funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as \nearly  as  July  2023—long  before  any  potential  change  in \nadministration.    See  NOFO  55-56  (J.A.  1787-88) \n(contemplating  departures  from  standard  EPA  practice, \nincluding  a  “one-time  or  periodic  balance-sheet \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 61 of 92\n31 \ncapitalization(s)”).  And there is nothing improper about it.  \nRather, “federal financial agents” like Citibank are “routinely \nappointed”  and  are  specifically  authorized  by  statute.  \nTransactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C. Cir. \n1996); 12 U.S.C. § 265.  Most relevant to EPA’s litigating \nposition,  the  financial  agent  structure  affords  EPA  more \noversight  than  the  agency’s  standard  payment  system.  \nCitibank’s interface displays these grantees’ and subgrantees’ \nexpenditures broken down by budget category and provides \nEPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees’ \nand subgrantees’ accounts.  Those oversight features are absent \nfrom EPA’s standard disbursement system, which reports only \nthe amount of money drawn down by the recipient.  EPA’s \ndetermination that the “prior administration’s designation of a \nfinancial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA’s oversight” has it \nbackwards.  Gov. Br. 10. \nIn  the  same  vein,  EPA  asserts  that,  because  some \nsubgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA \nlacks the “visibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making \nthose decisions or how that money is being used.”  Oral Arg. \nTr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10.  That concern inexplicably \ndisregards  the  many  ways  in  which  EPA  can  oversee  the \nsubgrantees’ activities.  EPA approved detailed budgets and \nworkplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant \nmoney.  Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, \nunder threat of “prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other \napplicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,” that \neach requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account \nis “necessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward \nAgreement  supported  with  EPA  funding.”    Subgrantee \nAccount  Control  Agreement,  Ex.  B  (J.A.  1189).    And \nsubgrantees’ progress against that workplan is tracked and \nreported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA.  \nFor  instance,  Rewiring  Community  Investment  Fund—a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 62 of 92\n32 \nPower Forward Communities subgrantee—describes how its \ninability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its \nobligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \n“establish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to \nprovide loans with significantly discounted interest rates” to \nhouseholds  for  energy-efficient,  clean  heating  and  cooling \nsystems.  Matusiak Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 447).  Moreover, many of \nthe subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves \nsubject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal \nReserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators.  JCF Ltr. \nat 3 (May 21, 2025).     \nTo the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees \nmay provide “subgrants to others, who then pass it through to \nothers,”  that  is  the  structure  that  Congress,  not  the  prior \nadministration, chose to adopt.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7434(b)(2) \n(“The eligible recipient shall provide funding” to “entities that \nprovide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, \nlocal, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, \nincluding community- and low-income-focused lenders and \ncapital providers.”). \nTellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA’s \nasserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by \nproposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding \nthat  was  slated  for  distribution  to  subgrantee  community \nlenders, EPA ignored it.  JCF Ltr. at 2-3.  Under the proposal, \nthe  vast  majority  of  the  Plaintiff’s  money  would  remain \nunspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could \nmonitor.  Instead of being distributed to the community lenders \nto lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans \nmade by those community lenders to small businesses and \ncommunities looking to finance clean energy projects.  In that \nway, the grant funds could have advanced the programs’ goals \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 63 of 92\n33 \nwhile largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA.  \nEPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up \nfrom the Plaintiff.  Id. at 1.  That lack of engagement further \nsuggests that EPA’s purported oversight concerns are not the \nreal reason it terminated Plaintiffs’ grant awards. \nAt bottom, each of EPA’s specific examples of oversight \nconcerns  is  refuted  by  the  record.    And  its  broad-brush \nargument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight \nmechanisms available to EPA.  EPA’s assertions that it had \nsuch grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant \nawards  overnight  run  aground  on  a  conceded  lack  of  any \nindication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award \nterms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of \ninterest, fraud, or criminal activity.  In addition to the real-time \nvisibility  Citibank  provides  EPA  into  Plaintiffs’  and  their \nsubgrantees’ accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, \nand annual reports detailing Plaintiffs’ transactions, activities, \nprogress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget \ncategory, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest \nreporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees.  Bafford Decl. \n¶ 35(a) (J.A. 373).  Before it purported to halt the program and \nitself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had \nalso held meetings with Plaintiffs “at least weekly, and, at \ntimes, two to three times per week,” to discuss their “program \nplans,  reporting,  oversight,  and  compliance  with  the  EPA \nTerms and Conditions.”  Id. ¶ 35(b) (J.A. 373); Arabshahi \nDecl. ¶ 34 (J.A. 1981).  On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are \nsubject to third-party audits and to “transaction testing” by \nEPA, in which EPA conducts a “systematic examination and \nverification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they \ncomply  with  the  grant’s  terms,  conditions,  and  applicable \nregulations.”  Bafford Decl. ¶ 35(g), (h) (J.A. 373). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 64 of 92\n34 \nEPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant \nawards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, \nclaiming that these “last-minute” modifications in the waning \ndays of the Biden administration were implemented to “make \nit  more  difficult  for  the  government  to  terminate  the \nagreements.”    Maj.  Op.  5;  see  Gov.  Br.  10,  34.    EPA \nspecifically contends that the original terms of the awards \nallowed it to terminate them “based on [a] change in policy \npriorities,”  per  the  version  of  EPA’s  General  Terms  and \nConditions in place before October 2024—a contention the \nmajority credits.  Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1.  \nThat is incorrect.   \nThe original grant agreements, signed in August 2024—\nmonths  before  the  election—already  incorporated  the \ntermination  provision  from  EPA’s  now-operative  General \nTerms and Conditions.  Those General Terms and Conditions \nallow terminations of federal awards based on a change in \npolicy priorities only when that basis for termination is “clearly \nand unambiguously” set forth in the award agreement itself.  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added).  (Neither the \nEPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, \napart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be \nterminated  based  on  a  change  in  policy  priorities.)    The \nDecember 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not \nalter the permissible bases for termination, which had never \nallowed termination for changed policy priorities. \nPlaintiffs’ original award agreements specifically stated \nthat,  “[n]otwithstanding  the  General  Term  and  Condition \n‘Termination,’ [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] \nEPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement \nonly  as  specified  in  . . .  the  version  of  2  CFR  200.340 \napplicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. \nReg. 55262 (July 3, 2024).”  J.A. 552 (emphasis added).  The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 65 of 92\n35 \nversion of the regulation the awards incorporated from the \noutset was the one providing “that an agency may terminate a \nFederal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities (e.g. unilateral termination) but only when \nsuch language is clearly and unambiguously included in the \nterms and conditions of the award,” 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, \n55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).  \nEPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB’s invitation \nto  agencies  to  opt  into  the  revised  rule  before  its  default \nOctober  1,  2024,  effective  date.    As  of  July  2024,  EPA \nannounced in the Federal Register that it had “decided to apply \nthe  revised  version  of  2  CFR  200.340  to  EPA  financial \nassistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or \nafter July 1, 2024.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 55263.  The December \namendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA’s “control over \n[the] grant funding.”  Gov. Br. 10. \nThe timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous.  \nEPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in \nApril 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, \nand that it “expected the terms to change based on awardee \nfeedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for \nawardee workplans.”  Bafford Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 367).  EPA \naccordingly planned to communicate a “final” set of award \nterms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the \nfall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees’ \nsuggested  modifications  based  on  their  experience \nimplementing  the  programs.    Id.  ¶¶ 17-20  (J.A.  366-68).  \nDespite EPA’s and the majority’s insinuations to the contrary, \nnothing  about  the  timing  or  content  of  those  amendments \nsupports  Defendants’  assertion  that  they  were  intended  to \nreduce  the  agency’s  oversight  or  control  in  the  next \nadministration. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 66 of 92\n36 \nNeither  does  the  “gold  bars”  video,  which  Zeldin \nrepeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, \nprovide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on \nthe part of EPA’s new leadership.  In the November 2024 \nProject Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer \non a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that \nEPA was “trying to get the money out as fast as possible” \nbefore  Trump’s inauguration.  Lisa Friedman,  An Offhand \nRemark About Gold Bars, Secretly Recorded, Upended His \nLife, N.Y. TIMES (July 1, 2025), https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9.  \nWhatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot \nhave  been  referring  to  awards  under  the  Greenhouse  Gas \nReduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of \nAugust 2024 (in accordance with Congress’s September 2024 \ndeadline).  “EPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the \nClimate Crisis, and Save Families Money,” EPA (Aug. 16, \n2024), https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A.  Anyone with a basic \nfamiliarity with the GGRF program would understand that a \nvideo of a staffer’s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to \nthe grants at issue here. \nIn  sum,  the  record  makes  clear  that  EPA’s  abrupt \ntermination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing \ncannot  rationally  be  explained  by  reference  to  the  agency \nleadership’s professed oversight concerns.  That alone shows \nthat the agency violated the APA, as EPA’s explanation for its \ndecision to terminate the awards “runs counter to the evidence \nbefore” it.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Far more troubling, \nEPA’s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported \nby probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of \ncriminal activity strongly suggest that the agency’s professed \noversight concerns are pretextual.  EPA’s refusals to discuss its \ndeclared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their \nresponses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 67 of 92\n37 \noversight  questions  give  the  lie  to  its  widely  trumpeted \nconcerns.    Contrived,  baseless  justifications  for  the  grant \nterminations  do  not  satisfy  the  “reasoned  explanation \nrequirement of administrative law,” which “is meant to ensure \nthat  agencies  offer  genuine  justifications  for  important \ndecisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the \ninterested public.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 785.  The \nSupreme  Court has made clear that “[a]ccepting contrived \nreasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.”  Id.  “If \njudicial review is to be more than an empty ritual, it must \ndemand something better” by way of reasoned explanation than \nthe false statements EPA broadcast to build a sensationalist \npublic narrative in its favor.  Id.   \n2. Separation of Powers \nIt  is  equally  clear  that  EPA’s  actions  violate  the \nConstitution.    Our  constitutional  system  of  separation  of \npowers rests on the idea that national “policy is for Congress \nand the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, \nand for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to \nimplement within statutory boundaries.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d \nat 257.  “Money is the instrument of policy,” Clinton, 524 U.S. \nat 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress—not the \nexecutive  branch  acting  unilaterally—that  has  “exclusive \npower over the federal purse,” Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. \nE.P.A., 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  Only Congress \nmay  authorize  “money  [to]  be  paid  out  of  the  Treasury.”  \nCincinnati  Soap  Co.  v.  United  States,  301  U.S.  308,  321 \n(1937).  And when it does so, the executive “may not ignore” \nthose  funding  directives  “merely  because  of  policy \ndisagreement with Congress.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260. \nTo hold otherwise would allow “the executive [to] possess \nan unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,” 2 \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 68 of 92\n38 \nJOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE \nUNITED STATES § 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. \n1873)—the very concentration of power the Appropriations \nClause was intended to prevent.  See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 \nU.S.  at  321.    It  is  thus  incontrovertible  that,  “[a]bsent \ncongressional  authorization,  the  Administration  may  not \nredistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to \neffectuate its own policy goals.”  City & Cnty. of San Francisco \nv. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  As then-Judge \nKavanaugh explained, it is a “settled, bedrock principle[] of \nconstitutional  law”  that  neither  the  President  nor  his \n“subordinate executive agencies” may “decline to follow a \nstatutory  mandate  or  prohibition  simply  because  of  policy \nobjections.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259.  Insofar as the \nmajority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for \npolicy reasons, the majority’s assertion that “the [Inflation \nReduction] Act does not limit the Administrator’s discretion to \nwithhold or terminate grants,” Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts \nwith Aiken.  \nCongress  in  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  appropriated \nfederal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and \ninstructed EPA “to make grants” by September 30, 2024, to \n“nonprofit  organization[s]  that  [are]  designed  to  provide \ncapital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of \nfinancial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-\nemission products, technologies, and services.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(a)  (providing  funds  “to  remain  available  until \nSeptember  30,  2024”  and  instructing  EPA  to  make  the \ndescribed  grants),  (c)(1)(A)  (specifying  that  “eligible \nrecipients” must be able to leverage private capital).  The \nstatute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the \nprivate  sector  and  with  local  communities,  must  provide \nfunding  and  other  assistance  to  housing  and  infrastructure \nprojects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 69 of 92\n39 \n§ 7434(b).  EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer \nthose grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant \nprograms based on the Administration’s policy preference to \n“[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. \nThe district court found that EPA sought to do just that.  It \nfound that “EPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in \ntheir entirety as a policy matter,” as shown by EPA’s public \nexpressions of determination to shut down the grant program, \nand as confirmed by its action to terminate “all eight grants \ncomprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs.”  Climate \nUnited, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116.  The district court’s factfinding \nis amply supported by the record, and the majority’s conclusion \nthat it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA’s \nremarkable conduct in this case.  Maj. Op. 25-26.   \nAs already discussed, EPA’s actions at every turn reveal \nits determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction  Fund  programs  for  no  more  reason  than  that \nPresident Trump announced that goal.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8357 (directing agencies to “Terminat[e] the Green New Deal” \nby preventing the “disbursement of funds appropriated through \nthe Inflation Reduction Act”).  Without any further planning, \nconsideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs \nfrom accessing their funds.  Current agency leadership has \ndemonized  the  recipients  as  if  the  President’s  policy \npreferences alone license them to slander  as fraudulent or \ncriminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those \npreferences.    No  matter  that  all  evidence  confirms  that \nPlaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress \nintended and authorized.   \nIndeed, EPA’s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the \ngrant  awards  with  no  evidence  of  noncompliance  and  no \ncommunication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 70 of 92\n40 \nother than a decision to do what the President said he wanted \nonly because he said so.  The decision to terminate the grants \njust hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to \nrule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs’ access to their \naward funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to \nrewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with \nit.    Those  are  not  legitimate  means  to  advance  the  new \nPresident’s policy agenda.  Why terminate grant awards that \nhad  been  made  and  were  being  carried  out  as  Congress \nintended unless EPA’s real disagreement was with Congress’s \nlegislated policy choice to fund “green energy” projects? \nThe  majority  chides  the  district  court  for  discounting \nEPA’s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant \nprograms with increased oversight.  Maj. Op. 25-26.  At oral \nargument,  EPA  disavowed  any  “frontal  assault  on  the \nappropriation  or  Congress’s  objective,”  insisting  that  the \nagency “intends, as consistent with principles of appropriations \nlaw, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible \nway and in a way that comports with the oversight principles \nthat it thinks are important here.”  Oral Arg. Tr. at 25.  But, as \ndiscussed below, since the appropriation’s deadline to obligate \nthe funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to \nmake  “replacement”  grants  and  cannot  obligate  the  funds \nanew.   \nIn any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit \nEPA’s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress \nintended.  The court observed EPA’s track record throughout \nthis  case  of  making  slanderous  and  insupportable  public \nstatements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-\nserving contradictory representations.  The court knew that \nEPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to \nhunt  for  justifications  to  claw  back  Plaintiffs’  money  and \nobserved  that  the  agency  remained  unable  to  provide  any \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 71 of 92\n41 \nevidence  to  support  its  very  public  assertions  of \nmismanagement and insufficient oversight.  Presented with \nEPA’s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any \nother  basis,  the  district  court  was  on  unassailably  solid \nevidentiary footing in finding that EPA’s actions had nothing \nto do with its professed oversight concerns.   EPA simply \nsought to “dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a \npolicy matter.” Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.   \nEPA’s “repeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-\ncommit the funds,” Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light \nof its patent inability to do so.  See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11.  \nIt is an “elementary principle” of federal appropriations law \nthat “a federal agency’s budget authority lapses on the last day \nof the period for which funds were obligated.”  W. Va. Ass’n of \nCmty. Health Ctrs, Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  Here, Congress specified that the appropriation for \nthe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund would “remain available \nuntil September 30, 2024.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), (2), (3).  \nThe appropriation thus expired on that date, after which EPA \ncould no longer use the funding to incur new obligations.  See \nOff. of Nat. Res. Revenue-Coop. Agreements, B-321297, 2011 \nWL 3343023, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).   \nFederal  appropriations  law  thus  bars  EPA  from \nterminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to \nreconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs.  \n“If an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the \nperiod of availability, the funds are not available for new \nobligations.”  Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation \nfor Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at \n*3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001).  In other words, once EPA \nterminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority \nto make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations.  \nThe majority suggests that Congress’s repeal last month of the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 72 of 92\n42 \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA’s asserted \nauthority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any \nobligation to do so.  Maj. Op. 25 n. 11.  It does neither.  The \nstatute rescinds only “unobligated” funds: Obligated funds, \nlike those at issue here, are unaffected.  One Big Beautiful Bill \nAct (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, § 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 \n(2025).  See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of \nCourt  Cislak  (noting  that  Senator  Capito  described  the \nproposition  that  OBBBA  might  “claw  back  money”  as \n“ridiculous”) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&A: Sen. Shelley Moore \nCapito,  incoming  EPW  chair,  (Nov.  20,  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9).  It is the federal appropriations \nrule,  not  the  repeal  legislation,  that  prevents  EPA  from \nrecommitting the funds.   \nEPA’s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress’s \nplan by labeling its re-obligations as “replacement grants,” \nReply Br. 17, are empty promises.  The majority, too, cites \nreplacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA’s intent to \ncontinue the program with new grantees rather than terminate \nit.  Maj. Op. 24 & n.10.  To qualify as a replacement grant, the \nre-obligation would have to be “substantially identical in scope \nand purpose to the original grant.”  The Honorable Lawton \nChiles U.S. Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. \nGen. June 25, 1976).  Those requirements cannot be met by \nnew grants that materially alter the financial structure, number \nof grantees, or other oversight controls—meaning that EPA \nwould have to retain the very features it claims prompted the \nagency to interfere with Plaintiffs’ grants.  See NRDC Amicus \nBr. 9-13.   \nThe majority reasons that, because “there is no evidence \nthe  agency  sought  to  dismantle  the  programs  without \ncongressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the \ngrantees’ claims.”  Maj. Op. 26.  The majority’s factual premise \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 73 of 92\n43 \nis unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs’ separation of \npowers claim follows from Aiken County.  We held in Aiken \nCounty  that  executive  agencies  violate  the  constitutional \nseparation  of  powers  when  they  refuse  to  spend  money \nappropriated  by  Congress  because  they  disagree  with \nCongress’s policy choice.  725 F.3d at 260.  There, as here, \nCongress  appropriated  funds  for  a  particular  effort  (there, \nassessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making \ncompetitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency \nto act.  Id. at 257-58.  When the agency refused to adhere to the \nstatute due to “policy disagreement[s] with Congress,” we held \nthat  refusal  violated  the  Constitution,  posing  a  threat  to \nundermine “our constitutional system of separation of powers” \nthat supported judicial intervention.  Id. at 260, 267.   \nEPA’s  attempts  to  dismantle  the  statutorily  mandated \nNCIF  and  CCIA  programs  due  to  the  current  agency \nleadership’s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of \nthe Constitution in the same way.  In rejecting Plaintiffs’ \nseparation  of  powers  claim,  the  majority  says  that  it  is \n“declin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every \nstatutory  challenge  to  agency  action  into  a  constitutional \nclaim.”  Maj. Op. 23.  That may well be advisable, but it does \nnot describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here.  \nThe majority cannot choose to “decline” to apply our binding \nprecedent.    Wherever  the  line  between  constitutional  and \nstatutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA’s \nactions violated the Constitution. \nB.  Irreparable Injury and Balance of Equities \n  Baseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, \ncoupled with EPA’s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs’ \ngrant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more \nimportantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 74 of 92\n44 \nacross the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of \nthe money that Congress prescribed.  Without access to their \ngrant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make \npayments  for  rent,  third-party  contractors,  and  insurance \npolicies  critical  to  continue  operating,  and  many  of  the \nPlaintiffs  will  permanently  shutter  in  the  coming  months.  \nPlaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, \nlay  off,  withdraw  offers  from,  and  lose  employees  with \nspecialized expertise that “cannot be replaced easily, if at all.”  \nSupp. Bafford Decl. ¶ 7 (J.A. 954).   \nAbsent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already \nunderway will fold—projects intended to create demand for \nand boost the global competitiveness of U.S. advanced electric \nmanufacturing  capability,  provide  critically  necessary \naffordable  housing  and  infrastructure,  lower  energy  costs, \nimprove air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United \nStates.  If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding \nprovided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able \nto raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail.  \nThat is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees \nto invest in “qualified projects that would otherwise lack access \nto  financing.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434(b)(1).    As  just  a  single \nexample, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects \nto  install  clean-energy  microgrids  at  churches,  community \ncenters, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and \nAlabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing \npower sources.  Without the subgrantee’s promised funds, \nthose projects are at risk of being left undone.  The projects \nwere intended to provide vulnerable populations with “energy \nindependent  safe  havens  for  residents  and  community \nmembers”  during  increasingly  common  extreme  weather \nevents; instead, when blackouts inevitably happen, “[o]xygen \nmachines that would be powered by solar panels during a \nblackout will turn off” and “[e]ssential medications that require \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 75 of 92\n45 \nrefrigeration will warm and spoil.”  Parker Decl. ¶¶ 35-37 (J.A. \n950). \nEPA’s unlawful actions are not just an enormous loss to \nPlaintiffs and the American people.  They defy Congress’s \nobjectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-\nreducing  projects  “in  partnership  with,  and  by  leveraging \ninvestment  from,  the  private  sector.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434 \n(c)(3)(A).  By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs’ money, \nthe government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve \nas reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing \nfuture partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and \nfederal grant funding.  As one Plaintiff explained: \nTo be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or \nany  organization)  must  have  certainty  of  funding \nsources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in \nnegotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved \nparties.  CGC is made ineffective if potential partners \ncannot  rely  on  when  CGC’s  capital  will  become \navailable.  No credible counterparty will take this \nfunding risk, or be willing to be associated financially \nwith CGC. \nKauffman Decl. ¶ 13 (J.A. 429).  That reputational harm is \ndevastating to Plaintiffs.  Because “part of [Plaintiffs’] purpose \nis to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to \nprojects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence \nin  [Plaintiffs’]  commitments  as  . . .  investor[s]  is  vital  to \nachieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . .  The longer \nthe freeze on [Plaintiffs’] funds continues, the more difficult it \nwill be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors.”  \nId.  ¶¶ 18,  23  (J.A.  430-31).    Worse,  the  agency’s  action \ncontrary to Congress’ enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 76 of 92\n46 \nWhen Plaintiffs’ hard-won partnerships with private investors \nand community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy \nprojects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant \nto invest in similar ventures in the future.  Plaintiffs “have had \nto work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as \n[] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],” and the “knock-\non effects” of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \n“will delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF’s \nmission.”  Parker Decl. ¶¶ 25-26 (J.A. 947). \nThese harms are the very definition of irreparable injury.  \nOnce a lender’s reputation as a stable source of promised \nfunding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to \nrepair.  Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already \npulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over \nwhether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds.  Projects \nunderway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs’ inability to \nmake good on their loan commitments will be shut down \npermanently.   \nMore broadly, the distrust bred by EPA’s actions will \nmake it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and \ncooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, \nprivate businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying \nout Congress’s objective of building important projects at low \npublic cost by spending government grant money to leverage \nprivate investment.  What is more, without a court-ordered \ninjunction, the government’s actions portend that EPA will \ndrain the money from Plaintiffs’ accounts with no apparent \navenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it.  Once EPA successfully \nterminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury—\nas it intends to do as soon as the district court’s injunction is \nlifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16—it is unlikely that a court \nwould be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other \naction to fulfill the agency’s congressional mandate.  See City \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 77 of 92\n47 \nof Houston, Tex. v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, \n1426 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (explaining that “a court cannot reach” \nfunds that have reverted to Treasury “in order to award relief” \nwhen  the  appropriation  authorizing  their  expenditure  has \nexpired); 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a) (appropriations for GGRF grant \nprograms expired on September 30, 2024); see also generally \nBagenstos Amicus Br. (explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate \nthe grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the \nappropriation authorizing those funds expired in September \n2024).    Under  such  circumstances,  any  eventual  judicial \ndeclaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a \nhollow victory. \nOn the other side of the ledger, the government claims that \nallowing  Plaintiffs  to  access  their  funding  will  cause \n“substantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc.”  Gov. Br. \n41.    But  as  the  government  itself  submits,  its  “bases  for \ntermination  were  the  grants’  structure  and  terms”  which \n“reflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,” \nnot  anything  to  do  with  Plaintiffs’  “noncompliance”  or \n“conduct.”  PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. 503-04, 507) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The government insists that it is \n“not accusing anybody of fraud.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16.  That is, \nthe government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the \naward funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by \nCongress.  It is hard to see how the public is harmed by \nPlaintiffs’ use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its \nduly enacted policies. \nC.  Tucker Act \nThe government attempts to divert this court’s attention \nfrom its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district \ncourt lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  But the \ndistrict court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 78 of 92\n48 \nmeritorious separation of powers claim.  That alone provides \njurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.   \nIn any event, the majority’s conclusion that the Tucker Act \nbars Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is \nwrong.  Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant \nawards or any other form of specific performance of contracts.  \nNor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury.  \nTheir suit challenges the government’s decision to illegally \nseize their property—money in bank accounts opened in their \nnames, in which the government has only a security interest \n(which it has not exercised).  The grant awards define that \nmoney as “gross income earned by” Plaintiffs, meaning that \ntitle to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds \nwere deposited in their Citibank accounts.  Grant Award at 53 \n(J.A. 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.1). \nPlaintiffs’ title to the funds in their accounts is cemented \nby the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, \nand each grantee, which specify that Citibank “maintains the \nAccounts  for  [Plaintiffs],”  and  that  Plaintiffs  are  “the \nentitlement  holder[s]  with  respect  to  all  financial  assets \ncredited  from  time  to  time  to  the  Accounts.”    J.A.  1144.  \nCitibank’s status as a “fiduciary of the government,” Maj. Op. \n14—in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for \nPlaintiffs,  allow  them  to  “access  and  use  funds”  in  their \naccounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency \nAgreement Ex. A §§ I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A. 2145, 2149)—changes \nnothing about Plaintiffs’ title to the money in their accounts.  \nThat Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to \nserve as a custodian of Plaintiffs’ funds does not mean that the \ngovernment owns the funds. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs’ title to the award funds, which allows \nthe award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 79 of 92\n49 \nrisky  “expected  income  stream,”  is  critical  to  Congress’s \ndecision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is \none of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure.  \nImpact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14.  Plaintiffs thus \nseek an equitable remedy “for the recovery of specific property \nor  monies,”  which  stands  in  contradistinction  to  money \ndamages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988) \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (emphasis  added),  the \n“prototypical contract remedy,” Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. \nThe nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek—recovery of \nproperty that is lawfully theirs—suffices to resolve the Tucker \nAct question against the government.  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. \n731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle.  There, the \nplaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S. Maritime \nCommission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff \nalleged it owned under a contract with the Commission.  Id. at \n734.  The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over \nthe case even though the plaintiff’s alleged right to the disputed \nproperty originated in a contract and depended on interpreting \nthe contract in its favor.  The Court nonetheless recognized that \nthe plaintiff’s “claim rests on [its] right under general law to \nrecover  possession  of  specific  property  wrongfully \nwithheld”—a claim sounding in tort, not contract.  Id. at 735-\n36.  That was so even though the government possessed and \nhad “record title” to the property.  Id. at 737.  As the Court \nexplained: \n[P]ublic  officials  may  become  tort-feasors  by \nexceeding the limits of their authority.  And where \nthey unlawfully seize or hold a citizen’s realty or \nchattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or \nin equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims \nto recover a money judgment.  The dominant interest \nof the sovereign is then on the side of the victim who \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 80 of 92\n50 \nmay bring his possessory action to reclaim that which \nis wrongfully withheld. \nId. at 738.   \nWe acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line \ndrawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired \nby contract—which may proceed in district court—and claims \nto enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed \nin the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act:  “The Supreme \nCourt many years ago recognized a private party’s cause of \naction  outside  the  Tucker  Act  to  challenge  the  statutory \nauthority  of  federal  officials  to  claim  ownership  rights  in \nproperty allegedly transferred during the course of a contract.”  \n672 F.2d at 968-69.  That principle confirms the district court’s \njurisdiction here.  Moreover, these cases underscore that a \nclaim  to  recover  property  need  not  be  framed  as  an \nunconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.   \nPlaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with \ntheir previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the \nAPA.  Appellee Br. at 15.  Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \n“unlawfully  seize[d]”  their  property,  and  they  seek  an \ninjunction to “reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.”  \nDollar, 330 U.S. at 738.  This case is even clearer in that regard \nthan Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither \ntitle to nor possession of the disputed funds.  Plaintiffs’ action \nis one to recover their property.  It does not seek any money \nfrom  the  Treasury.    It  is  not  a  contract  action  so  is  not \n“relegated to the Court of Claims.”  Id.  As in Megapulse, \nPlaintiff’s  “position  is  ultimately  based,  not  on  breach  of \ncontract,  but  on  an  alleged  governmental  infringement  of \nproperty rights and violation of [a statute].” 672 F.2d at 969.  \n  The  Supreme  Court  itself  recently  recognized  that \ndistinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 81 of 92\n51 \nCoalition,  where  it  declined  to  stay  a  district  court  order \nrequiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs \nfor foreign aid work they had already completed.  145 S. Ct. \n753 (2025).  The government argued there, as here, that the \nplaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract \nso must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims.  See id. at 756 \n(Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., \ndissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the \ndistrict court’s order).  The Court was unpersuaded that the \ngovernment thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity \nbar against the district court’s jurisdiction.  Id. at 753.  Like the \ngrantees  here,  the  plaintiffs  in  AIDS  Vaccine  Advocacy \nCoalition  brought  APA  and  constitutional  challenges  to \ndefendants’ interference with their existing entitlement to grant \nfunding.    Their  claims  depended  not  on  breach  of  their \ncontracts,  but  on  the  unlawfulness  of  the  government’s \nactions.  The district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA \nand constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in \nAIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, \npayment was already made. \n \nThose  same  facts—that  Plaintiffs  seek  an  injunction \npreventing the government from interfering with money the \ngovernment has already properly disbursed to them—renders \ninapplicable the Supreme Court’s emergency stay orders in \nNational Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass’n, \nNo.  25-A-103,  2025  WL  2415669  (Aug.  21,  2025),  and \nDepartment of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025).  \nI respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no \npart of the district court’s injunction in this case “order[s] the \npayment  of  money”  from  the  Treasury  or  requires  the \ngovernment  to  “pay  out  past-due  grant  obligations”  or  to \n“continue paying obligations as they accrue.”  Dep’t of Ed., 145 \nS. Ct. at 968.  And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of \nHealth,  Plaintiffs  here  need  not  seek  to  enforce  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 82 of 92\n52 \ngovernment’s “obligation to pay money,” 2025 WL 2415669, \nat *1, because these Plaintiffs’ money was already paid before \nDefendants interfered with it.     \nRather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds \nand to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based \non  the  President’s  announced  policy  disagreement  with \nCongress’s objectives.  In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA’s \ndecision to replace Congress’s legislated policy choice with \none aligning with the President’s directions.  See Executive \nOrder 14154 (ordering agencies to “Terminat[e] the Green \nNew Deal” by stopping the “disbursement of funds”); J.A. 507 \n(Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction \ndescribing contract terminations as “reflect[ing] no more than \na decision based on reasons of policy”) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 \n(finding that EPA “seeks to dismantle these grant programs in \ntheir entirety as a policy matter”).  To the extent National \nInstitutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court’s \njurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs’ \nfunds.  See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at \n*2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely \nhas jurisdiction over challenges to an agency’s policies).         \nBinding precedent of this court anchors the district court’s \njurisdiction.  Our “longstanding test for determining whether a \nclaim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court \npursuant to the Tucker Act” confirms that the Tucker Act does \nnot displace the district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \narbitrary and capricious claim.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106.  We \nexplained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of \nClaims’  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  “actions  based  on \ngovernment contracts,” a plaintiff whose “claims against the \nUnited States are essentially contractual” cannot be allowed to \n“avoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 83 of 92\n53 \nthe Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would \nenable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate \nstatute.”  672 F.2d at 967.  Whether a “particular action” is “‘at \nits essence’ a contract action depends both on [1] the source of \nthe rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon \n[2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Id. at 968.  That \nis  a  flexible,  context-specific  inquiry  that  directs  us  to \n“determine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract \naction that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the \nCourt of Claims.”  Id. \nStarting with the first prong, to determine whether the \n“source of the rights” of a claim is contractual, we consider \nwhether the plaintiff’s arguments turn on the terms of the \ncontract.  In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we \nconcluded that the plaintiff’s claims were not “a disguised \ncontract action” because the plaintiff did not “seek to enforce \nany duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant \ncontract],” nor did it “contend [the government] breached the \nterms” of the contract or “invoke” the contract in any other \nmeaningful way.  864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \n“convinced” that the plaintiff’s claims were not “disguised” \ncontract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not “claim a \nbreach of contract” and based its “request for relief” on non-\ncontractual documents.  672 F.2d at 969. \nPlaintiffs’ APA challenge to Defendants’ arbitrary and \ncapricious action is clearly not a “disguised contract action.”  \nTheir claim is not premised on EPA’s violation of the grant \nagreements’  termination  provisions,  nor  on  its  failure  to \nperform any duty “imposed” on EPA by the grant award.  \nRather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because \nEPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, \ninternally  inconsistent,  and  unfounded  reasons.    See,  e.g., \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 84 of 92\n54 \nPlaintiffs’ Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A. \n327) (arguing that “the record leading up to the termination”—\nfor example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants \nseveral days after professing a “lack of critical information” \nabout  “concerns  regarding  potential  fraud”  that  would  be \ninformed by an ongoing compliance review—“highlights the \npretextual nature of EPA’s stated invocation of waste, fraud, \nand abuse”).  According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the \nrecord, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable \nagency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs \nhad been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact \njustifications—including  pressuring  Citibank  into  freezing \nPlaintiffs’ funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and \ndirecting DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into \nPlaintiffs’ grant performance without probable cause, or any \ngrounds whatsoever.  See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A. 299-302).  \nThat is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action \nthe  APA  is  designed  to  address.    As  the  Supreme  Court \nexplained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency \naction is arbitrary and capricious when the agency’s “stated \nrationale was  pretextual,”  because  “contrived  reasons  . . . \ndefeat the purpose of” the “reasoned explanation requirement \nof administrative law.”  588 U.S. at 773-74, 785.  The non-\ncontractual “essence” of Plaintiffs’ APA claim has been clear \nsince Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary \ninjunction.  They have from the outset sought to show that \nEPA’s  vague,  unsupported,  and  irrational  justifications  are \nmerely “pretextual cover to shut down a program approved by \nCongress that the new Administration does not like.”  PI Mot. \n29 (J.A. 327).  That was clear to the district court from the very \nfirst hearing.  See Mar. 12 TRO Hr’g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A. 182) \n(district court observing that the terminations have “a ready, \nfire, aim” feel).  Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential \nclaim of arbitrary and capricious agency action.  The APA, and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 85 of 92\n55 \nnot the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is \nthe “source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its \nclaims.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. \nAs for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis—the \n“type of relief sought”—we have described the “crux of this \ninquiry” as “boil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively \nseeks  to  attain  .  .  .  monetary  relief  from  the  federal \ngovernment.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.  As explained above, \nPlaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only \nto get the government’s hands off their money.  To the extent \nthe injunction preventing the government from interfering with \nor  seizing  their  funds  “require[s]  the  same  governmental \nrestraint that specific []performance might require in a contract \nsetting,” that is an “insufficient basis to deny a district court the \njurisdiction  otherwise  available  and  the  remedial  powers \notherwise appropriate.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971. \nBoth prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the \nsame conclusion:  Plaintiffs’ claim of arbitrary and capricious \nagency action is not a “disguised” contract action that must be \nheard by the Court of Claims.  That conclusion comports with \nour  longstanding  recognition  that  the  Tucker  Act  was  a \nresponse to “congressional intent to provide a single, uniquely \nqualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes.”  \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.  The “unique expertise of the \nCourt of Claims” lies in its “knowledge of the government \ncontracting  process,”  id.;  it  is  a  “specialized  forum”  for \nawarding “damages for the Government’s past acts,” Bowen, \n487 U.S. at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIt is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of \nClaims to resolve these Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief \nhalting EPA’s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in \ndisregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 86 of 92\n56 \nPlaintiffs’ claim that EPA violated the APA’s ban on arbitrary \nand capricious agency action—a claim for which they seek \ninjunctive  relief,  not  payment  from  the  Treasury—is  well \nwithin the district court’s remit.   \nThat Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin \nwith but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, \ndoes not alter that conclusion.  We have squarely held that the \nfact that a plaintiff “would have no claims to assert” absent a \ngovernment contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \n“contract right.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that \nimposing such a “‘but-for’ test for identifying the source of the \nright . . . contravenes Megapulse’s express rejection of the \nargument  that  the  mere  existence  of  such  contract-related \nissues  converts  the  action  to  one  based  on  the  contract”) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. \nBank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1992)  (“[L]itigants  may  bring  statutory  and \nconstitutional claims in federal district court even when the \nclaims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the \ngovernment.”), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in \nPerry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620. \nAt bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs’ real \ncomplaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards—not that \nit acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so—making its \nclaim “in essence” a contract claim.  It is obviously true that \nPlaintiffs are injured by the terminations.  But it does not follow \nthat Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims.  When EPA \nbegan  its  campaign  to  undo  the  GGRF,  it  had  already \nperformed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by \nthen belonged to Plaintiffs.  The fact that those funds may only \nbe  used  in  accordance  with  grant  terms  does  not  mean \nPlaintiffs’ only legal right to protect them arises from contract. \nAs explained above, Plaintiffs’ theory of relief is that EPA \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 87 of 92\n57 \ncarried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to \nreplace  Congress’s  policy  choice  with  its  own  preferred \napproach,  without  regard  for  whether  its  actions  were \nsupported by evidence or reason.  That is a classic claim of \narbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA.  \nThat is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \n“source of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] \nclaims.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. \nBecause Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional \nclaims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would \nnot reach their ultra vires theory.  But to the extent the majority \nconcludes  that  Plaintiffs’  ultra  vires  claim  fails  because \nPlaintiffs “essentially” allege only a breach of contract, the \nmajority errs.  Maj. Op. 21-22.  For all the reasons discussed \nabove, Plaintiffs’ claims are not “essentially” contractual. \nCiting Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of pretextual agency  action are  contract claims \nbecause “that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of \nfederal  contract  law”—that  is,  Plaintiffs’  pretext  argument \ncould be rephrased as a claim that EPA “dishonor[ed], with \nimpunity,  its  contractual  obligations.”    Maj.  Op.  17.    But \nPlaintiffs’  APA  claim  is  not  “essentially”  contractual  just \nbecause EPA’s arbitrary and capricious action included grant \nterminations.  The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as \nestablishing  a  rule  that  any  claim  that  could  be \nreconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even \nin part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a \ndisguised contract claim.  See Maj. Op. 16.  Ingersoll-Rand \nannounces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do \nsquarely conflicts with our binding precedent.  \nIn Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract \nwith the plaintiff “for convenience,” as allowed under the terms \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 88 of 92\n58 \nof the contract.  Id. at 75.  The plaintiff sued, alleging that the \ntermination  violated  several  regulations  constraining  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  cancel  and  administer  federal \nacquisition  contracts,  and  that  those  regulatory  violations \nmeant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.  Id. at \n77.  We held that the “essential rights at stake” were contractual \nbecause the regulations themselves—the violation of which \nwas  allegedly  arbitrary  and  capricious—concerned  the \nconditions under which the government could terminate the \ncontract.  Id. at 77-78.  In effect, the plaintiff had relied on \nregulations circumscribing the government’s behavior during \nthe solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the \nvalidity  of  the  contract’s  termination-for-convenience \nprovision.  The plaintiff’s claim thus “call[ed] for knowledge \nof the government contracting process” and fell “within the \nunique expertise of the Court of Claims.”  Id. at 78.  In that \ncontext,  in  which  the  plaintiff’s  claim  centered  on  the \nintricacies of the government’s contracting process and the \ninteraction between contracting regulations and the terms of the \nplaintiff’s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff’s \nability to “challenge the termination based solely on contract \nprinciples”  supported  our  determination  that  its  claim \n“sound[ed]  genuinely  in  contract.”    Id.  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nIngersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke \nregulations  governing  federal  contracting  to  challenge \ngovernment action taken pursuant to a contract are “in essence” \ncontractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that \ncourt’s  expertise  in  government  contracting  is  particularly \nrelevant.  And it supports the majority’s conclusion that claims \nbased  on  violations  of  regulations  governing  termination \nprocedures are “in essence” contract claims, which is likely \ncorrect.  See Maj. Op. 11-13.  But that does not describe \nPlaintiffs’  arbitrary  and  capricious  claim.    Ingersoll-Rand \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 89 of 92\n59 \ndecidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that \ncould have been framed as a breach of “principles of federal \ncontract law” must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims” \nMaj. Op. 17—a rule that could not be squared with our other \nrelevant decisions.   \nThat is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, \n798 F.2d 1521 (D.C. Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-\nJudge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand.  The \nplaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy \nremoving  him  from  the  Ready  Reserve  where  he  served \npursuant to a contract—the Ready Reserve Service Agreement.  \n798 F.2d at 1521-23.  The plaintiff alleged that the policy \nbreached his contract and violated a  statute governing the \nReady  Reserve,  and  that  the  contract  gave  him  a  “vested \nproperty interest” in serving in the reserves that the government \n“sought to deny without due process.”  Id. at 1523.  The \nplaintiff’s requested relief included a declaration that the policy \nwas “contrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a \nmaterial breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,” as \nwell as a declaration that the government’s “failure to honor \nthe  terms  of  that  contract  deprived  [the  plaintiff]  of  due \nprocess.”  Id.  We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the \ndistrict  court’s  jurisdiction  over  the  plaintiff’s  breach  of \ncontract  claim,  it  did  not  displace  the  district  court’s \njurisdiction  over  the  plaintiff’s  claims  that  the  policy  was \n“contrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution.”  Id.; \naccord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610.  That is, the plaintiff’s \nstatutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been \nunlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the \nReady Reserve were not “in essence” contractual even though \nhis right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he \nexpressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 90 of 92\n60 \nThe  majority’s  view  of  Ingersoll-Rand  cannot  be \nreconciled with Sharp.  Allen Sharp’s statutory, regulatory, and \nconstitutional  claims  not  only  could  be  based  on  contract \nprinciples,  but  in  fact were  also  framed  that  way.    If  the \nmajority’s rule were right, the district court could not have \nexercised jurisdiction over his due process claim.  The same \nanalysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself.  There, the plaintiff \nalleged  that  the  government’s  plan  to  distribute  his  data \nviolated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property \nwithout due process.  672 F.2d at 962-63.  That claim, too, \ncould have been based solely on contract principles, as the \ngovernment had made a contractual promise not to disseminate \nthe plaintiff’s “limited rights” data.  Id. at 962.  But that \ncounterfactual did not preclude us from holding—nor even \nfactor  into  our  conclusion—that  the  district  court  had \njurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim.  See id. at 966-71.   \nIndeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that \nthe Tucker Act means that “an agency action may not be \nenjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply \nbecause that same action might also amount to a breach of \ncontract.”  Id. at 971.  Rather, district courts have jurisdiction \nover and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even \nif that action also “amounts to” a breach of contract.  Id.  That \nis the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA’s termination \nwas arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and \nunsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant \naward’s termination provision.  The fact that the government’s \narbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as \na claim that “EPA acted with ‘impunity’ when terminating the \ngrants” does not transform the claim into a contract action. \nIn  relegating  to  the  Court  of  Claims  any  statutory, \nregulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably \ncould to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 91 of 92\n61 \nmajority’s  rule  precludes  district  court  jurisdiction  and \ninjunctive  relief  for  a  wide  swath  of  claims  that—like \nPlaintiffs’ claim that EPA’s actions to freeze their accounts and \nterminate  their  grants  were  arbitrary  and  capricious—are \nsimply  not  contract  claims.    Such  a  rule  effects  an \nunprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced \nfrom the “congressional intent to provide a single, uniquely \nqualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,” \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of \njurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the \nrelevant expertise.  It also threatens to “preclude any review at \nall of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the \nconstitutional  claims  stem  from  contracts,”  thereby  raising \n“serious constitutional question[s].”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at \n611 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it flies in the face \nof our cases’ longstanding refrain that “the mere fact that a \ncourt  may  have  to  rule  on  a  contract  issue  does  not,  by \ntriggering  some  mystical  metamorphosis,  automatically \ntransform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the \ncourt of jurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Crowley, 38 \nF.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).  Such a \nrule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from \nmaking  “rational  distinctions  between  actions  sounding \ngenuinely in contract and those based on truly independent \nlegal  grounds,”  and  runs  directly  counter  to  our \nacknowledgement that, “[a]lthough it is important on the one \nhand to preserve the Tucker Act’s limited and conditioned \nwaiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not \ndo so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction \nto consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than \na contractual relationship with the government.”  Megapulse, \n672 F.2d at 968-70.   \nAs applied in this case, the majority’s conclusion that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are merely contract claims ignores what the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5122      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 92 of 92\n62 \nagency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring.  \nThis case is not an attempt to reframe EPA’s termination or \nviolation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action.  \nIndeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any \ndispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant \nawards.  That is not what this case is about.  Plaintiffs challenge \nEPA’s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions \nto pursue its desired ends—here, the termination of the grant \nawards—regardless of the means it must employ to get there.  \nIt is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the \nway our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Court of Claims. \nCONCLUSION \nEmbracing  a  misguided  and  breathtakingly  expansive \nconception  of  the  Tucker  Act,  the  majority  allows  the \ngovernment to seize Plaintiffs’ money based on spurious and \npretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation \nof major congressional legislation designed to improve the \ninfrastructure, health, and economic security of communities \nthroughout the country.  The injunction the district court put in \nplace  is  eminently  supported  by  Plaintiffs’  likelihood  of \nsuccess  on  both  their  APA  and  constitutional  claims,  the \nirreparable  harm  that  will  befall  them,  and  the  unlawful \nnullification of Congress’s duly enacted policy—all of which \ninure to the detriment of the American people.  I respectfully \ndissent. \n ",

Citing \nconcerns about conflicts of interest and lack of oversight, EPA \nterminated the grants in March 2025. The grantees sued, and \nthe district court entered a preliminary injunction ordering EPA \nand Citibank to continue funding the grants.  \nWe conclude the district court abused its discretion in \nissuing the injunction. The grantees are not likely to succeed \non the merits because their claims are essentially contractual, \nand  therefore  jurisdiction  lies  exclusively  in  the  Court  of \nFederal Claims. And while the district court had jurisdiction \nover the grantees’ constitutional claim, that claim is meritless. \nMoreover, the equities strongly favor the government, which \non behalf of the public must ensure the proper oversight and \nmanagement of this multi-billion-dollar fund. Accordingly, we \nvacate the injunction.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 4 of 92\n4 \nI. \nThis  case  involves  EPA  grants  awarded  under  the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund,  for  which  Congress \nappropriated $27 billion. Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, Pub. \nL. No. 117-169, § 60103, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065–67 (formerly \ncodified at 42 U.S.C. § 7434 (2024)). In August 2024, EPA \nawarded $20 billion to eight nonprofits pursuant to two of the \ngrant programs it created: the National Clean Investment Fund \nand the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. Five of \nthose grantees are plaintiffs in this case: Climate United Fund \n($6.97 billion), Coalition for Green Capital ($5 billion), Power \nForward Communities, Inc. ($2 billion), Inclusiv, Inc. ($1.87 \nbillion), and Justice Climate Fund, Inc. ($940 million).  \nEach grant was memorialized in an agreement between the \nnonprofit and EPA. The grant agreements have an unusual \nstructure. Typically, grant funds are held by the U.S. Treasury \nand  disbursed  incrementally  as  grantees  use  the  funds  for \nprogram  purposes.  EPA  structured  these  grants  with  a \nmiddleman that would hold the funds as a “financial agent” of \nthe United States. According to EPA, this was the first time the \nfederal  government  used  a  financial  agent,  as  opposed  to \nTreasury, to carry out this kind of grant program. Treasury \nentered a Financial Agency Agreement (“FAA”) with Citibank. \nAs set forth in the grant agreements, the funds were to be \ntransferred  from  Treasury  to  Citibank  in  a  “two-step \ntransaction” involving a “drawdown” by the grantee and a \nsubsequent  “disbursement”  to  the  appropriate  Citibank \naccount. J.A. 566. The disbursement by the grantee is deemed \n“an allowable cost” under “the EPA award.” Id.  \nAlthough the funds are held at Citibank, the grantees’ use \nof the funds remains highly restricted. The money may be used \nonly “for the purposes and under the conditions of the [grant \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 5 of 92\n5 \nagreement],” and “must be maintained” at Citibank until the \nend  of  the  grant’s  period  of  performance.  J.A.  568.  The \ngrantees’ use of the funds is further restricted by Account \nControl Agreements (“ACAs”) between EPA, Citibank, and \neach of the grantees. The ACAs give the government a “right \nto exclusive control” over the Citibank accounts. J.A. 72. If the \ngovernment  exercises  that  right,  Citibank  must  follow  the \ngovernment’s transfer instructions “without further consent by \nthe  [grantee].”  Id.  The  ACAs  expressly  acknowledge  that \nCitibank  “act[s]  as  a  financial  agent  of  the  United  States \npursuant  to  the  authority  of  the  U.S.  Department  of  the \nTreasury.” J.A. 71. \nThe sheer scale of the grant program and the method of \nallocating  billions  of  dollars  drew  public  attention  and \ncriticism. The record includes a widely publicized video in \nwhich an EPA employee was recorded describing how “until \nrecently” his role was to make sure proper “processes are in \nplace to … prevent fraud and to prevent abuse,” but after the \nelection of President Donald Trump, EPA was “just trying to \nget the money out as fast as possible before they come in \nand … stop it all.” J.A. 705 n.1. The employee compared the \nsituation to “throwing gold bars off the Titanic.”  \nThe month before President Trump’s inauguration, EPA \nmodified  the  grant  agreements—with  no  apparent \nconsideration from the grantees—to make it more difficult for \nthe government to terminate the grants.1 The week before the \n \n1 In December 2024, the government unilaterally modified the grant \nagreements,  including  by  (1) eliminating  any  reference  to \ntermination  for  agency  priorities;  (2) requiring  “credible \nevidence … of  a  violation  of  Federal  criminal  law”  before  the \ngovernment could exercise its contractual right to terminate for \nwaste, fraud, or abuse; and (3) giving the grantees an expanded right \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 6 of 92\n6 \ninauguration, EPA amended the ACAs to require Citibank to \n“continue  to  disburse  funds”  to  the  grantees,  even  if  the \ngovernment exercised its right of exclusive control, if the funds \nare “associated with financial obligations ‘properly incurred’” \nbefore the government exercised its right. J.A. 658. \nAfter the change in administration, EPA reviewed the \ngrants and raised concerns about conflicts of interest during the \naward process, the political connections of the chosen grantees, \nlack of government oversight and control over tens of billions \nof dollars, and last-minute amendments to the grant agreements \nand  ACAs.2  In  February  2025,  the  FBI  recommended  to \nCitibank  that  it  “place  an  administrative  freeze  on  the \naccount(s)  associated  with”  the  grantees’  ACAs.  As  the \ngovernment’s financial agent, Citibank complied and stopped \ndisbursing funds to the grantees. EPA also referred the matter \nto the Office of Inspector General for investigation. Shortly \nthereafter, EPA terminated the grant agreements. \nThe grantees sued, seeking to enjoin the terminations as \nunconstitutional, unlawful, and arbitrary and capricious. They \nsought a preliminary injunction barring EPA from terminating \nthe grants “except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, \nthe grant award, and applicable law,” and ordering Citibank to \n \nto cure any nonperformance. There is no serious dispute that these \nmodifications increased the likelihood that a termination by the \nincoming administration would constitute a breach of contract. \n2 For example, the Acting Deputy Administrator averred in a letter \nto  the  EPA  Inspector  General  that  “the  former  director  of  the \n[Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund], personally oversaw a $5 billion \ngrant to his previous employer, the Coalition for Green Capital – \nwithout recusing himself.” J.A. 670. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 7 of 92\n7 \nresume disbursements “in accordance with the ACA.” J.A. \n171–72.  \nThe district court entered the injunction. It first held that it \nhad  jurisdiction  because  the  grantees’  claims  were  not \nessentially contractual and therefore did not need to be brought \nin  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims.  Climate  United  Fund  v. \nCitibank, N.A., 778 F. Supp. 3d 90, 107–11 (D.D.C. 2025). On \nthe merits, the court concluded the grantees were likely to \nsucceed on their constitutional, regulatory, and arbitrary and \ncapricious claims. The district court found the balance of harms \nsupported an injunction because the nonprofits exist “to fulfill \nthe objectives of a grant” and “sufficient protections [are] in \nplace” to prevent “reckless spending.” Id. at 117, 120. The \ndistrict court further concluded that an injunction “halt[ing] any \nunlawful action” serves the public interest. Id. at 121. The court \nenjoined  Citibank  as  well,  requiring  it  to  disburse  funds \naccording to the relevant agreements. \nWe administratively stayed the injunction and ordered the \nparties to take no action “directly or indirectly” with respect to \nthe  disputed  funds,  thereby  prohibiting  the  grantees  from \nmaking further commitments in reliance on the disputed funds. \nWe then accelerated consideration of the merits of the appeal. \nII. \nWhile  this  litigation  was  pending,  Congress  enacted \nlegislation repealing the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. See \nPub.  L.  No.  119-21,  § 60002,  139  Stat.  72,  154  (2025) \n(repealing  42  U.S.C.  § 7434  and  rescinding  “unobligated \nbalances of amounts made available to carry out that section”). \nOur partial administrative stay did not lift the portion of the \ndistrict court’s order enjoining the grant terminations, so the \nfunds at  issue in this case remain at  Citibank and  remain \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 8 of 92\n8 \nobligated. Congress’s repeal of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund therefore did not render this appeal moot. \nWe review the district court’s preliminary injunction for \nabuse of discretion, its underlying legal conclusions de novo, \nand  its  findings  of  fact  for  clear  error.  Huisha-Huisha  v. \nMayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022). We consider the \nsame Winter factors the district court applied, which require a \nplaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction to establish that it “is \nlikely to succeed on the merits, that [it] is likely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in [its] favor, and that an injunction is \nin the public interest.” Id. at 727 (quoting Winter v. NRDC, 555 \nU.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  \nIII. \nThe district court erred in concluding the grantees are \nlikely to succeed on their regulatory, arbitrary and capricious, \nand constitutional claims. See Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, \n1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (describing likelihood of success on the \nmerits  as  the  “most  important  factor”  when  considering  a \npreliminary injunction). The grantees’ regulatory and arbitrary \nand capricious claims can be heard only in the Court of Federal \nClaims, and their constitutional claim is meritless. \nA. \nThe grantees first allege the termination of their grants \nviolated  Office  of  Management  and  Budget  (“OMB”) \nregulations  and  was  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). As a remedy, they \nsought and received an injunction barring the termination of \ntheir grants and restoring access to the funds held by Citibank. \nWe conclude the district court lacked jurisdiction over these \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 9 of 92\n9 \nclaims, which are essentially contractual and therefore must be \nheard in the Court of Federal Claims.3  \n1. \nThe federal government enjoys sovereign immunity and \nmay be subject to suit only when it has explicitly waived that \nimmunity. United States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392, 399 (1976). \nWaivers of sovereign immunity must be strictly construed to \nprotect the prerogatives of the government and to ensure the \ncourts stay within the jurisdiction provided by Congress. See \nLane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996); Larson v. Domestic & \nForeign  Com.  Corp.,  337  U.S.  682,  703–05  (1949).  The \ngrantees brought their claims in district court, invoking the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity, which applies to claims \n“seeking relief other than money damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. \nBut this waiver applies only if no “other statute that grants \nconsent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which \nis sought.” Id. For contract claims against the government, the \nTucker Act establishes review in the Court of Federal Claims, \nwhich  may  award  only  damages  and  cannot  provide \n \n3 Although the dissent considers this threshold jurisdictional question \na  “diver[sion],”  Dissenting  Op.  47,  our  authority  to  assess  the \nlawfulness  of  EPA’s  actions  of  course  depends  on  having \njurisdiction. Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 94 \n(1998). Concluding that jurisdiction over most of these claims lies \nwith the Court of Federal Claims, we do not reach their merits. The \ndissent inverts this fundamental limitation on Article III courts by \nrecounting at great length the integrity and virtue of the previous \nadministration’s efforts to implement the Inflation Reduction Act \nand the alleged misdeeds of the current administration in terminating \nthe grants. Our jurisdiction, however, rests on law, not on the severity \nof the alleged wrongdoing claimed by the grantees and reported by \nThe  Washington  Post,  The  New  York  Times,  and  Politico.  See \nDissenting Op. 11, 12, 14, 36. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 10 of 92\n10 \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief except in narrow circumstances. \nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1491; Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, \n963 n.13 (D.C. Cir. 1982); Walters v. Sec’y of Defense, 725 \nF.2d 107, 112 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 1983).  \nWhen it applies, Tucker Act jurisdiction is exclusive and \nprecludes jurisdiction in district court under the APA’s waiver \nof sovereign immunity.4 See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. \nof Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. Cir. 1992). The \nCourt of Federal  Claims is  the “single, uniquely  qualified \nforum for the resolution of contractual disputes.” Ingersoll-\nRand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985). \nBecause Congress has limited the forum and the remedies for \ncontract claims against the government, a litigant whose claim \nis essentially contractual cannot “avoid the jurisdictional (and \nhence remedial) restrictions of the Tucker Act” by simply \nasking for injunctive relief in district court. Megapulse, 672 \nF.2d at 967; Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613 (“[T]he APA does not \nwaive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking specific \nrelief.”).  \nThis  jurisdictional  inquiry  cannot  turn  on  a  plaintiff’s \npreferred  characterization  of  its  claim,  lest  we  “upset  the \ncarefully modulated waiver of sovereign immunity and grant \nof remedies for breach of contract embodied in the Tucker \nAct.” Int’l Eng’g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d \n573, 580 (D.C. Cir. 1975); see also McKay v. United States, \n \n4 The Tucker Act contains one exception to this rule, not relevant in \nthis suit involving billions of dollars. Damages claims not exceeding \n$10,000 may be brought in district court, although the Tucker Act’s \nremedial restrictions still apply. See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a)(2); Int’l \nEng’g Co., Div. of A-T-O v. Richardson, 512 F.2d 573, 577 n.4 (D.C. \nCir. 1975); see also Contract Disputes Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-\n563, §§ 3(a), 10(a), 14(a), 92 Stat. 2383, 2383–84, 2388–89 (limiting \nexception to non-procurement claims). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 11 of 92\n11 \n516 F.3d 848, 851 (10th Cir. 2008) (“[I]n the contract context, \na distinct line of authority preserves the sovereign’s immunity \nfrom  being  compelled  to  perform  obligations  it  prefers  to \nbreach and compensate financially, holding that what are ‘in \nessence’ claims for breach of contract cannot circumvent the \nTucker Act and its prohibition on equitable relief by being \nartfully pled as something else.”). \nTo  determine  whether  jurisdiction  was  proper  in  the \ndistrict court, we must therefore assess whether the grantees’ \nclaims are essentially contractual. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–\n68. The fact that the grantees’ “complaint nowhere mentions \nbreach  of  contract … cannot  alone  suffice  to  establish \njurisdiction in the District Court.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at \n77. Instead, for each claim we consider (1) whether “the source \nof the rights” asserted is contractual or is “based on truly \nindependent legal grounds” and (2) whether “the type of relief \nsought” is a typical contract remedy. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at \n968–71; see Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609.  \n2. \nThe  grantees  first  allege  EPA’s  termination  of  their \nagreements  violated  OMB  regulations.  By  terminating  for \n“agency  priorities,”  EPA  allegedly  relied  on  a  basis  for \ntermination not set forth in the grant agreements, in violation \nof 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4). Furthermore, EPA allegedly failed \nto provide written notice of termination as required by 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.341(a).  Despite  the  grantees’  characterization,  their \nclaims are essentially  contractual and therefore the district \ncourt lacked jurisdiction to hear them.  \nFirst, the source of the grantees’ right to the relief they seek \nis  their  agreements,  which  are  contracts  for  Tucker  Act \npurposes. See Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 \n(2025) (per curiam); Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 12 of 92\n12 \n990 F.3d 1330, 1338–41 (Fed. Cir. 2021); see also Medina v. \nPlanned Parenthood S. Atl., 145 S. Ct. 2219, 2231 (2025) \n(explaining  that  courts  have  historically  described  federal \ngrants as contracts). Each grantee’s right to the funds arises \n“only upon creation and satisfaction of its contract with the \ngovernment; in no sense d[oes] it exist independently of that \ncontract.” Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d \n891,  894  (D.C.  Cir.  1985).  While  the  grantees  attempt  to \nground their claims in OMB guidance, the substance of these \nclaims may be understood “as entirely contained within the \nterms  of  the  contract”  or  in  principles  of  contract  law. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.  \nThe claim that EPA violated 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) \nexpressly refers to and incorporates the grant agreements. The \ngrantees  interpret  this  OMB  guidance  as  prohibiting  the \ngovernment from terminating based on agency priorities unless \nthe grant agreements reserve the right to terminate on those \ngrounds. Even assuming this is what the guidance requires, the \ngrantees’ claim turns on the government’s rights under the \nagreements—a  question  of  contract  interpretation  that  the \nparties  fiercely  dispute.  Because  this  claim  perforce \nincorporates the grant agreements, it is not based “solely” on \nthe  regulation  or  on  “truly  independent  legal  grounds.” \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78; Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969–\n70.  \nThe  claim  that  EPA  failed  to  give  proper  notice  of \ntermination in violation of 2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a) is not an \nindependent legal ground for a slightly different reason. This \nallegation “could be phrased” as a claim that the government \nstopped performing on the contract without sufficient warning. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. Federal contract law addresses \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 13 of 92\n13 \nwhen defective notice by the government is actionable,5 and \ntherefore the substance of the grantees’ claim can be analyzed \n“solely on contract principles.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78. \nAs  we  have  explained,  the  fact  that  the  government’s \ntermination of a contract “also arguably violates certain other \nregulations does not transform the action into one based solely \non those regulations.” Id. Indeed, “[i]f the mere allegation” of \nviolations of the regulations governing federal contracting and \ngrantmaking “were to bring claims of this type within the \njurisdiction  of  the  district  court,  Congress’  intent  to  limit \ncontract remedies against the government to damages in the \n[Court of Federal Claims] would be effectively circumvented.” \nId. (cleaned up). Because the substance of the grantees’ notice \nclaim sounds in federal contract law, the claim is essentially \ncontractual and can be heard only in the Court of Federal \nClaims.  The  grantees  cannot  avoid  the  Tucker  Act’s \njurisdictional channeling by disguising a breach of contract \nclaim as a claim that the government violated the regulations \ngoverning grantmaking. \nFurthermore,  the  guidance  documents  on  which  the \ngrantees rely likely do not create enforceable private rights \nbecause they merely set out principles for agencies to follow \nwhen  making  grants.  See  Guidance  for  Federal  Financial \nAssistance, 89 Fed. Reg. 30046, 30089–90 (Apr. 22, 2024). \nThese guidance provisions fall within subtitle A of Title 2, \nwhich sets forth OMB’s “guidance to Federal agencies on \n \n5 See, e.g., Decker & Co. v. West, 76 F.3d 1573, 1579 (Fed. Cir. 1996) \n(“[H]arm  should  accompany  a  defect  in  an  otherwise  proper \ntermination notice in order for the contractor to seek relief based on \nthat defect.”); Philadelphia Regent Builders v. United States, 634 \nF.2d 569, 572–73 (Ct. Cl. 1980) (declining to treat government’s \ntermination as defective because government’s regulatory violations \nwere “harmless technical defects”). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 14 of 92\n14 \ngovernment-wide policies for the award and administration of \nFederal financial assistance.” 2 C.F.R. § 1.100(a). “Publication \nof the OMB guidance in the [Code of Federal Regulations] \ndoes not change its nature—it is guidance, not regulation.” Id. \n§ 1.105(b).  But  in  any  event,  as  the  dissent  concedes, \nDissenting  Op.  58,  these  regulatory  claims  are  essentially \ncontractual, and we have no jurisdiction to consider them. \nSecond,  the  Court  of  Federal  Claims  has  exclusive \njurisdiction because the remedy the grantees seek is contractual \nin nature. The grantees requested an injunction barring EPA \nfrom terminating the grants, “except as permitted in accordance \nwith  the ACA, the grant  award, and applicable law,” and \nordering  Citibank  to  resume  disbursements  “in  accordance \nwith the ACA.” The grantees maintain they own the funds and \nseek an injunction barring unlawful interference, rather than an \norder for specific performance. But the grantees’ “ownership” \nof the funds goes only as far as the grant agreements and the \nACAs permit. And the funds are held by Citibank, which acts \nas a fiduciary of the government. Despite their characterization, \nin substance, the grantees are seeking specific performance of \ntheir agreements with the government.6 As then-Judge Scalia \n \n6 The dissent’s only legal argument that we have jurisdiction turns \non the claim that the grantees have “title” to the billions of dollars in \ngovernment  funding.  To  demonstrate  the  grantees’  ownership, \nhowever, the dissent relies on the grant agreements and the ACAs—\nthat is, on the disputed and ongoing contracts that govern the parties’ \nrelationship.  Dissenting Op. 48. The dissent’s  argument merely \nreinforces that this dispute is contractual and belongs in the Court of \nFederal Claims. And even assuming the grantees had somehow \nsecured title, that would simply mean the grantees might have a \nTakings Clause claim for damages, a claim they have not made and \nwhich in any event would also have to be brought in the Court of \nFederal Claims. See Knick v. Township of Scott, 139 S. Ct. 2162, \n \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 15 of 92\n15 \nexplained, “[t]he waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] \ndoes not run to actions seeking declaratory relief or specific \nperformance in contract cases.”7 Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 \nF.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C. Cir. 1986). “[A] complaint involving a \nrequest  for  specific  performance  must  be  resolved  by  the \n[Court of Federal] Claims.” Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 80. \nIn sum, the grantees cannot manufacture district court \njurisdiction  through  artful  pleading.  Because  the  grantees’ \nregulatory  claims  are  essentially  contractual,  they  must  be \nheard in the Court of Federal Claims. \n3. \nNor can the grantees repackage their contract claims by \ninvoking the APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. The \ngrantees’ arbitrary and capricious claims are also essentially \n \n2170, 2173 (2019) (explaining the Tucker Act “provides the standard \nprocedure  for  bringing  [takings]  claims”  against  the  federal \ngovernment  and  that  “[e]quitable  relief  [is]  not  available”  if \n“monetary relief … under the Tucker Act” is). \n7 The dissent’s reliance on Sharp is entirely misplaced. In Sharp, \nthere was no dispute that the plaintiff was a military officer, that he \nhad an interest in his employment, and that the deprivation of that \ninterest without due process could be litigated in district court under \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 71 (1974). See Sharp, 798 F.2d at \n1523. Here, by contrast, the rights and interests of the grantees are \ndisputed. The grantees assert they “performed” on their contracts \nwhen Treasury deposited federal funds at Citibank, the government’s \nfinancial  agent.  Even  overlooking  the  oddity  of  this  argument, \nwhether the grantees have performed depends entirely on the terms \nof the disputed contracts—a question that must be adjudicated in the \nCourt of Federal Claims.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 16 of 92\n16 \ncontractual,  considering  both  the  source  of  the  legal  right \nasserted and the remedy sought.  \nThe  grantees  assert  the  government  acted  arbitrarily \nbecause it “offered no facts or individualized reasoning to \njustify” the grant terminations. And the grantees insist they can \nchallenge  the  sufficiency  of  the  government’s  reasons  for \nterminating the grants separately from the issue of whether the \nterminations were allowed under the agreements. But this court \nhas expressly and repeatedly rejected attempts to manufacture \ndistrict  court  jurisdiction  by  framing  contract  claims  as \nviolations of the APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action. \nSee Ingersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77–78; Richardson, 512 F.2d \nat 580. Despite the grantees’ characterizations, the remedy they \nseek is specific performance of their contracts, and they have \nidentified no right to that relief that is “truly independent” of \nthe grant agreements. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970. \nAs  already  discussed  in  reference  to  the  grantees’ \nregulatory claims, the grantees seek to set aside their grant \nterminations, which means they seek specific performance. \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 79–80. This is a “typical contract \nremedy” that indicates a claim is “founded upon a contract for \npurposes of the Tucker Act.” Spectrum Leasing, 764 F.2d at \n894–95; see also Transohio, 967 F.2d at 613.  \nThe APA’s substantive bar on arbitrary and capricious \naction  does  not  give  the  grantees  an  independent  right  to \nspecific performance of their grant agreements. To the extent \nthe grantees argue the government acted arbitrarily by failing \nto follow the terms of the grant agreements, that argument can \nbe evaluated only by “reference to and incorporation of” the \nagreements. Richardson, 512 F.2d at 578. The source of the \nright  asserted  is  therefore  not  “truly  independent”  of  the \ncontracts. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 970.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 17 of 92\n17 \nTo the extent the grantees argue the terminations were \narbitrary regardless of whether they were permitted under the \nagreements, that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of \nfederal contract law. That law prohibits the government from \n“dishonor[ing],  with  impunity,  its  contractual  obligations” \neven when a contract allows the government to terminate for \nconvenience. Maxima Corp. v. United States, 847 F.2d 1549, \n1553 (Fed. Cir. 1988) (cleaned up). The grantees’ argument \nthat the termination was arbitrary and capricious is simply a \nclaim that EPA breached the grant agreements by terminating \nwith “impunity.” That claim must be brought in the Court of \nFederal Claims.  \nThe grantees insist the APA gives them an independent \nright to be free of arbitrary agency action, including contract \nterminations. But we have long rejected the idea that the APA’s \ngeneral bar on arbitrary and capricious action subjects contract \nterminations to a parallel review scheme in district court.8 See \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 77–78; Richardson, 512 F.2d at \n580 (“[D]ecisions made by contracting officers pursuant to \ncontract clauses fall outside the contemplation of the [APA].”). \nThe APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action did not \n“destroy  the  Court  of  [Federal]  Claims  by  implication.” \nRichardson, 512 F.2d at 580 (cleaned up).  \n \n8 The dissent’s analysis focuses on the grantees’ “theory of relief” \nand concludes that because the grantees have “legitimate” APA \nclaims and request injunctive relief, the district court has jurisdiction. \nDissenting Op. 56–57. But Supreme Court and circuit precedent \nrequire that we look beyond plaintiffs’ characterization of their \nclaims  and  determine  whether  the  claims  are  “based  on  truly \nindependent legal grounds,” not simply whether plaintiffs have made \ngood faith legal arguments. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 969–70. On \nthis central question, the dissent has nothing to offer.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 18 of 92\n18 \nIn sum, district courts have no jurisdiction to hear claims \nthat  the  federal  government  terminated  a  grant  agreement \narbitrarily  or  with  impunity.  Claims  of  arbitrary  grant \ntermination  are  essentially  contractual  and  fall  outside  the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity. \nThis  conclusion  is  reinforced  by  the  Supreme  Court’s \nrecent decision in a stay posture that a very similar arbitrary \nand capricious challenge to federal grant terminations likely \ncould not be brought in district court. See Dep’t of Educ., 145 \nS. Ct. at 968. In that case, state plaintiffs sued in district court \nand  claimed  the  Department  of  Education’s  decision  to \nterminate several grants was arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA. The district court enjoined the terminations. The Court \nstayed the injunction on the ground that the district court likely \nlacked jurisdiction over the APA claims because “the Tucker \nAct grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits \nbased on ‘any express or implied contract with the United \nStates.’” Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)). The Supreme \nCourt has doubled down on this conclusion in another case \nstaying an injunction against discretionary grant terminations: \n“The [APA]’s ‘limited waiver of [sovereign] immunity’ does \nnot provide the District Court with jurisdiction to adjudicate \nclaims ‘based on’” the plaintiffs’ grants “or to order relief \ndesigned to enforce any ‘obligation to pay money’ pursuant to \nthose grants.” Nat’l Institutes of Health v. Am. Pub. Health \nAss’n, No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (Aug. 21, 2025) \n(quoting Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968). \nThe  Court’s  reasoning  requires  respect  and  strongly \nsupports  our  conclusion  that  the  grantees’  arbitrary  and \ncapricious challenge to the grant terminations is a disguised \ncontract claim that cannot be heard in district court. See Trump \nv. Boyle, 145 S. Ct. 2653, 2654 (2025) (“Although our interim \norders are not conclusive as to the merits, they inform how a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 19 of 92\n19 \ncourt should exercise its equitable discretion in like cases.”); \nPriests  for  Life v. HHS, 808 F.3d 1, 25 (D.C. Cir. 2015) \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n(explaining that Supreme Court stay orders are “extremely \nstrong signals”); see generally Trevor N. McFadden & Vetan \nKapoor,  The  Precedential  Effects  of  The  Supreme  Court’s \nEmergency Stays, 44 Harv. J. L. & Pub. Pol’y 827, 831 (2021) \n(arguing  some  emergency  orders  are  “authoritative  with \nrespect to future cases considering the same legal questions”).  \nIn the face of this overwhelming authority, the grantees \nnonetheless maintain that jurisdiction over their arbitrary and \ncapricious claims is proper. But the two cases on which they \nrely cannot support that conclusion.  \nThe grantees point out that this court reviewed an agency’s \ngrant termination under the APA’s arbitrary and capricious \nstandard in Kansas City v. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, 923 F.2d 188, 193 (D.C. Cir. 1991). But the \ncourt in that case made no mention of the Tucker Act, nor did \nit engage with our decisions in Richardson and Ingersoll-Rand. \nThis drive-by jurisdictional holding does not bind us. Steel Co. \nv. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998). Just one \nyear  later,  we  extensively  considered  the  jurisdictional \nframework  and  “decline[d]  to  overrule  this  Court’s  very \nspecific  holdings  that  the  APA  does  not  waive  sovereign \nimmunity  for  contract  claims  seeking  specific  relief.” \nTransohio, 967 F.2d at 613. As the Supreme Court’s stay order \nin Department of Education confirms, Kansas City is an outlier \nand  does  not  support  district  court  jurisdiction  over  the \ngrantees’ arbitrary and capricious claims. \nSecond, the grantees point to Maryland Department of \nHuman  Resources  v.  Department  of  Health  and  Human \nServices, which held that a state agency could maintain an \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 20 of 92\n20 \narbitrary and capricious claim in district court to challenge the \nfederal government’s withholding of grant funds. 763 F.2d \n1441, 1451, 1453 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In that case, the federal \ngovernment was required by law to pay block grant funds to \nMaryland according to  a statutory formula. See 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1397a(a)–(b),  1397b(b)  (1982).  We  explained  that \nMaryland’s  claim  was  not  contractual  for  purposes  of  the \nTucker Act because it “turn[ed] on the interpretation of statutes \nand  regulations  rather  than  on  the  interpretation  of  an \nagreement negotiated by the parties.” Maryland, 763 F.2d at \n1449. There was no “contract within the meaning of the Tucker \nAct”—only statutes and regulations that dictated how much \nMaryland was entitled to receive, how the funds could be spent, \nand under what circumstances the federal government could \nwithhold payment. Id.  \nBy contrast, these grant agreements are “contracts” within \nthe  meaning  of  the  Tucker  Act  because  they  include  the \ntraditional  contract  elements  of  offer,  acceptance,  and \nconsideration. See, e.g., Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; \nColumbus Reg’l Hosp., 990 F.3d at 1338–41. The grantees do \nnot suggest that any of these elements is lacking. Moreover, the \nInflation Reduction Act did not specify who was to receive \nmoney from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund or in what \namount.  Those  determinations  were  to  be  made  “on  a \ncompetitive basis” at the discretion of the EPA Administrator. \n42 U.S.C. § 7434(a) (2024). The grantees obtained federal \nfunds  only  because  they  were  awarded  discretionary  EPA \ngrants,  the  terms  of  which  are  governed  by  the  grant \nagreements. See Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, \nat *4 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(explaining that Department of Education “controls” when a \ndistrict court seeks to remedy “the government’s denial of \npreviously awarded discretionary grants”). The dispute over \nthe termination of these agreements does not turn solely, or \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 21 of 92\n21 \nreally at all, on the statute, and the relief sought is continued \nperformance of the agreements.  \nIn  short,  the  grantees  cannot  circumvent  the  Court  of \nFederal Claims by arguing that EPA’s termination of the grants \nwas arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.  \n4. \nFinally,  the  grantees  cannot  bring  their  regulatory  or \narbitrary and capricious claims in district court by arguing that \nthe EPA Administrator acted ultra vires. The grantees invoke \nthe Larson-Dugan doctrine, which, like the Ex parte Young \nexception to state sovereign immunity, holds that sovereign \nimmunity does not bar suits against federal officers whose \n“powers are limited by statute” and whose actions go “beyond \nthose limitations” or are “constitutionally void.” Larson, 337 \nU.S. at 689, 701–02; see also Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.S. 609, \n621–23  (1963).  The  grantees  insist  Administrator  Zeldin \nexceeded his lawful authority by terminating the agreements in \nviolation of the OMB guidance provisions and the APA’s bar \non arbitrary and capricious action. We disagree. \nThe Supreme Court in Larson recognized that the ultra \nvires  exception  to  sovereign  immunity  does  not  apply  to \ncontract claims: “The Government, as representative of the \ncommunity as a whole, cannot be stopped in its tracks by any \nplaintiff  who  presents  a  disputed  question  of  property  or \ncontract right.” 337 U.S. at 704. As already explained, the \ngrantees’  regulatory  and  arbitrary  and  capricious  claims \nessentially allege the government (1) violated the terms of the \ngrant agreements and (2) acted with impunity. If proven, these \nclaims establish breach of contract. They do not establish that \nthe government (or any official) acted in excess of statutory \nlimits or in contravention of the Constitution, as is required to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 22 of 92\n22 \ninvoke the Larson-Dugan exception.9 See Larson, 337 U.S. at \n695 (squarely rejecting the contention that “an officer given the \npower to make decisions” only has sovereign immunity when \nhe “make[s] correct decisions”).  \nThe grantees cannot bootstrap district court jurisdiction \nthrough  the  ultra  vires  exception  to  sovereign  immunity \nbecause their regulatory and arbitrary and capricious claims are \nessentially contractual. \nB. \nThe  grantees  also  maintain  that  EPA  violated  the \n“Separation  of  Powers”  by  not  enforcing  the  Inflation \nReduction Act, citing In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255 (D.C. \nCir. 2013). The grantees contend that Congress directed how \nand when the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund appropriations \nwere to be spent and that EPA violated those directives by \ncanceling the grant agreements. Although the district court had \njurisdiction over this claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the \nmerits.  \nAs an initial matter, this is not a constitutional claim at all, \nbut rather a claim that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction \nAct.  Claims  that  agency  officials  acted  in  excess  of  their \nstatutory authority do not ipso facto allege violations of the \n“Separation of Powers.” See Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, \n \n9 This is consistent with the general principle that “[i]t is not illegal \nfor a party to breach a contract.” United States v. Blankenship, 382 \nF.3d 1110, 1133 (11th Cir. 2004). “The duty to keep a contract at \ncommon law means a prediction that you must pay damages if you \ndo not keep it[]—and nothing else.” United States v. Winstar Corp., \n518  U.S.  839,  919–20  (1996)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring)  (quoting \nHolmes, The Path of the Law (1897), in 3 The Collected Works of \nJustice Holmes 391, 394 (S. Novick ed. 1995)).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 23 of 92\n23 \n474 (1994) (distinguishing between “claims that an official \nexceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and claims \nthat he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other”); cf. \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (distinguishing judicial review of agency \naction “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity”  and  action  “in  excess  of  statutory  jurisdiction, \nauthority, or limitations”). As we recently explained, when a \n“supposed  separation-of-powers  violation  turns  entirely  on \nwhether  [executive]  officials  violated  the  governing \nstatutes, … Dalton requires us to analyze the claim as an ultra \nvires one.” Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, No. 25-\n5091, 2025 WL 2371608, at *19–20 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 15, 2025); \nsee also Glob. Health Council v. Trump, No. 25-5097, 2025 \nWL 2326021, at *6–9 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 13, 2025). The grantees \nhere allege violations of the statute, not the Constitution, and \nwe  decline  to  adopt  a  principle  that  would  convert  every \nstatutory challenge to agency action into a constitutional claim.  \nWe conclude EPA did not violate the Inflation Reduction \nAct  when  it  terminated  these  grants.  The  grantees  have \nidentified no statutory provision that barred the cancellation of \nthe  grants.  In  relevant  part,  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act \n“appropriated  to  the  Administrator”  $20  billion  “to  make \ngrants[] on a competitive basis” and provided that the funds are \n“to remain available until September 30, 2024.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(a) (2024). The grantees interpret these provisions as a \nmandate that EPA spend the full $20 billion, a mandate that \nEPA  allegedly  violated  when  it  cancelled  grants  after  the \nSeptember 2024 appropriation deadline. But even assuming the \nstatute  required  EPA  to  obligate  all  $20  billion  by  the \nappropriation deadline, EPA did so. EPA later cancelled the \ngrants, but the Act does not limit the Administrator’s discretion \nto  withhold  or  terminate  grants.  And  EPA  repeatedly \nrepresented that it planned to recommit the funds. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 24 of 92\n24 \nThe  grantees  and  the  dissent  insist  EPA’s  promise  to \nrecommit  the  funds  was  hollow  because  the  Inflation \nReduction  Act  appropriation  had  lapsed  by  the  time  EPA \nterminated the grants, and therefore EPA had no ability to \nrecommit the funds. But the grantees cite no authority for the \nproposition  that  when  an  agency  cancels  a  grant  after  an \nappropriation has lapsed, any recommitment of those funds \nrequires deobligation and a new appropriation by Congress. \nIndeed, such a categorical rule would be inconsistent with the \nlongstanding  position  of  the  Government  Accountability \nOffice—a legislative agency—that the Executive Branch may \nissue replacement contracts even after an appropriation has \nlapsed. See Funding of Replacement Contracts, 68 Comp. Gen. \n158,  158  (Dec.  19,  1988);  see  also  31  U.S.C.  § 1552(a) \n(providing that appropriation account does not close until five \nyears after an appropriation expires).  \nIn fact, the Executive often issues replacement contracts \nafter terminating for convenience, a practice the Comptroller \nGeneral  has  approved  for  decades.10  See  U.S.  General \nAccounting Office, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law \n3d ed., vol. 1, 5-28–5-33 (Jan. 2004) (discussing history of \nreplacement  contracts  and  associated  Comptroller  General \nopinions). Moreover, the rule the grantees assert would be \ninconsistent with this court’s recognition that the government \ngets “a second chance to obligate” even after an appropriation \nhas lapsed if a court sets aside the original, timely obligation. \nPopulation Inst. v. McPherson, 797 F.2d 1062, 1071 (D.C. Cir. \n1986). Considering the longstanding practice of the political \nbranches, as well as our precedent, we are not persuaded that \n \n10 The Comptroller General opinion the dissent cites is inapposite \nbecause it involves new obligations, not replacement grants. See \nDissenting  Op.  41.  Replacement  grants  do  not  require  a  new \nobligation of funds. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 25 of 92\n25 \nthe government lacks authority to recommit the funds after \ntermination.11 \nThe district court’s determination that the grantees were \nlikely to succeed on their “constitutional” Inflation Reduction \nAct claim rests on both factual and legal error. The court found \nthat “EPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in their \nentirety as a policy matter.” Climate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. \n3d at 115. This factual determination was not supported by any \nevidence in the record and rested only on the district court’s \nassertion that EPA “suspended all eight grants.” Id. at 116. But \nthe suspension of the grants standing alone cannot demonstrate \nEPA  was  shutting  down  the  statutory  programs  without \ncongressional approval. Indeed, EPA repeatedly stated that it \nplanned to recommit the grant money with greater oversight \nand accountability, contradicting the district court’s shutdown \nfinding. Absent any clear evidence to the contrary, EPA’s \nrepresentations were entitled to a presumption of regularity. \nSee Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. Reagan, 870 F.2d \n723, 727 (D.C. Cir. 1989).  \nRather than credit EPA’s statements or explain why the \npresumption of regularity was overcome, the district  court \nsimply declared EPA was shutting down the programs. The \ncourt  disregarded  the  government’s  interest  in  prudent \nmanagement  of  the  grant  programs  and  the  government’s \nrepresentations that it planned to properly supervise, rather \n \n11 We need not consider for purposes of this appeal whether the \nrecent  repeal  of  the  Greenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund,  and  the \nrecission  of  “unobligated  balances,”  affects  EPA’s  ability  to \nrecommit the funds at issue here. If the repeal of the statute bars EPA \nfrom recommitting the funds, it stands to reason that the repeal also \nrelieves EPA of any statutory obligation to do so. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 26 of 92\n26 \nthan abandon, the grantmaking process.12 The district court’s \nconclusory  factual  finding  of  program  dismantlement  was \nclearly erroneous. See United States v. Microsoft Corp., 253 \nF.3d 34, 118 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (explaining that even on clear \nerror review the court is not required to “accept findings that \nare utterly deficient”). \nBecause EPA issued the grants in accordance with the \nInflation Reduction Act, and there is no evidence the agency \nsought  to  dismantle  the  programs  without  congressional \napproval, In re Aiken County cannot support the grantees’ \nclaims. In that case we issued a writ of mandamus because for \nyears  the  Nuclear  Regulatory  Commission  flagrantly \ndisregarded statutory commands, failed to spend appropriated \nfunds, and plainly stated it had no intention of complying with \nits statutory obligations. In re Aiken County, 725 F.3d at 257–\n59. By contrast, EPA entered the grant agreements before the \nappropriation expired in September 2024, in compliance with \nany requirement in the Inflation Reduction Act to spend funds. \nEPA subsequently terminated the agreements because of its \nconcerns about lack of oversight and potential conflicts of \ninterest during the award process.  \nEPA’s actions here are well within the Executive Branch’s \nauthority and responsibility to manage the expenditure of funds \nand to ensure that money appropriated by Congress is properly \nspent for its intended purposes. The grant terminations may be \n \n12 The district court also ignored the government’s evidence of \nmismanagement of the grant funds, such as the damning “gold bars” \nvideo,  which  further  supports  EPA’s  good  faith in  deciding to \nterminate the grants and recommit the funds with proper supervision \nand accountability. See J.A. 107 n.1. Moreover, the dissent focuses \nprimarily on EPA’s actions against these grantees, but the repeated \nrecounting of these actions tells us little about whether EPA will \nrecommit the funds through a more robust process. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 27 of 92\n27 \nchallenged on the merits as a breach of contract, but nothing in \nthe Inflation Reduction Act prevented EPA from taking care \nthat the grant programs be faithfully executed. \nThe grantees’ false invocation of the separation of powers \ncannot justify this preliminary injunction, which bars EPA \nfrom  carrying  out  basic  executive  functions  to  ensure  the \nprudent  and  effective  management  of  substantial  public \nfunds.13  \nIV. \nThe district court also abused its discretion in applying the \nremaining Winter factors: irreparable harm to the plaintiff, the \nbalance of the equities, and the public interest. While some \ngrantees may be forced to shutter their operations during the \nlitigation, their harms do not outweigh the interests of the \ngovernment and the public in the proper stewardship of billions \nof taxpayer dollars. \nA. \nThe  loss  of  grant  funds  during  this  litigation  is  not \nirreparable because the harm is compensable through money \ndamages.  The  district  court  concluded  the  grantees  would \nsuffer irreparable harm because their “purpose” and “business \noperations … depend[] on their grant money.” Climate United \nFund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117. But it is well-established that \n“economic loss does not, in and of itself, constitute irreparable \nharm.” Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 F.3d 544, \n555 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (cleaned up). Pecuniary injuries can be \n \n13 The grantees also argue EPA will violate the Appropriations \nClause  if  it  reobligates  the  funds  after  terminating  the  grant \nagreements. The district court did not base its preliminary injunction \non this argument, so we do not address it. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 28 of 92\n28 \nredressed through money damages if a plaintiff proves its case. \nWe have recognized only one exception, for pecuniary loss that \n“threatens  the  very  existence  of  the  movant’s  business.” \nWisconsin Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985).  This  exception  generally  applies  when  government \naction threatens the existence of an independent private entity. \nSee, e.g., Alpine Sec. Corp. v. Fin. Indus. Regul. Auth., 121 \nF.4th 1314, 1329 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (finding irreparable harm \nwhen a financial services firm would be forced to shutter if \nregulatory action took effect during litigation). \nThe  grantees  do  not  fall  within  this  exception.  The \nnonprofit entities that may need to suspend operations are \nentities that were created solely for the purpose of applying for \nand spending these federal grants. So while their “existence \nrelies on grant money” as the district court held, that is because \nthese entities were established to benefit from government \nlargesse.  Creating  such  an  entity  cannot  establish  an \nirrevocable claim to government funds or an entitlement to \ninjunctive  relief  preventing  the  Executive  Branch  from \nsupervising and managing those funds. In short, the existential \nthreat alleged by the grantees does not amount to irreparable \nharm. \nEPA terminated the grants because of concerns about the \nintegrity  of  the  grantmaking  process.  While  litigation  is \npending, the grantees may have to scale down their operations \nor return to the operational status they had before they received \nfederal funds. Although this causes some harm, the harm is \nreadily compensable through damages and therefore  is not \nirreparable. \nB. \nThe balance of the equities and the public interest factors \nsimilarly  favor  the  government.  The  injunction  harms  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 29 of 92\n29 \ngovernment and the public interest by preventing the Executive \nBranch  from  properly  and  prudently  managing  billions  of \ndollars  in  public  funds.  The  grantees  have  an  interest  in \ncontinued access to government funding. But the government \nand the public have a stronger interest in protecting the public \nfisc and eliminating  the  appearance of impropriety around \nthese grant programs.  \nMoreover, if the grant terminations are later determined to \nbe a breach of contract, the government may be required to pay \ndamages to the grantees, which would substantially, if not \nentirely, redress the grantees’ interim injuries. By contrast, if \nthe government’s position is eventually vindicated, it will have \nno apparent means to recover funds spent down while the \nlitigation has run its course. See Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 \nWL 2415669, at *1 (Order) (recognizing irreparable harm to \nthe government because the grant “funds cannot be recouped \nand  are  thus  irrevocably  expended”)  (cleaned  up).  The \ngovernment’s  (and  the  public’s)  harm  from  an  erroneous \ninjunction is thus irreparable in a way that the grantees’ harm \nfrom an erroneous contract termination is not. \nFinally,  Congress  has  explicitly  channeled  breach  of \ngovernment contract claims to the Court of Federal Claims and \nlimited remedies to damages. See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967 \n(“The Court of [Federal] Claims may neither grant declaratory \nnor injunctive relief.”) (cleaned up). The district court has no \njurisdiction over these claims, and even the Court of Federal \nClaims lacks authority to issue injunctive relief. The public \ninterest favors limiting federal courts to the jurisdiction and \nremedies provided by Congress. See Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 \nS. Ct. 2540, 2562 (2025) (“When a court concludes that the \nExecutive Branch has acted unlawfully, the answer is not for \nthe court to exceed its power, too.”).  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 30 of 92\n30 \nThe same considerations support vacating the injunction \nas to Citibank. The district court did not find that the grantees \nwere likely to succeed on any of their independent claims \nagainst Citibank, which involve breach of contract, conversion, \nand replevin. To the contrary, the court found that “Citibank \nperformed its obligations under the FAA in accordance with its \nresponsibilities  as  a  financial  agent  of  the  United  States.” \nClimate United Fund, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116. The injunction \nagainst Citibank merely serves to stop Citibank from following \nthe  government’s  instructions,  which  the  district  court \nconsidered  unlawful.  Because  we  conclude  the  injunction \nagainst  the  government  should  be  vacated,  the  derivative \ninjunction against Citibank must be vacated as well. \n* * * \nFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate the district court’s \ninjunction and remand the case to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion. \nSo ordered. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 31 of 92\n \nPILLARD, Circuit Judge, dissenting:   On the majority’s \ntelling, Plaintiffs bring garden-variety contract claims against \nEPA’s reasonable decisions to terminate their grant awards.  \nThat version of events fails to contend with the government’s \nactual behavior and misapprehends Plaintiffs’ claims, leading \nthe majority to the wrong conclusion at every step of its review \nof the district court’s preliminary injunction.   \nThree years ago, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction \nAct.    One  of  the  law’s  signature  provisions  directs  the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to distribute $20 billion in \ngrants  for  investment  in  projects  to  develop  clean  energy \ninfrastructure  and  manufacturing  capacity.    Congress \nstructured the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to provide jobs \nwhile reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving air \nquality,  especially  in  low-income  and  underinvested \ncommunities.  EPA distributed the grant money by the fall of \n2024, as Congress required.   \nAfter  the  change  in  administration,  in  response  to \nPresident Trump’s directives to terminate the “Green New \nDeal,” new leadership at EPA decided to take back the money \nalready awarded to Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs were holding and \nspending the money exclusively as Congress intended.  Yet \nEPA—in conjunction with counterparts at the Department of \nJustice,  the  FBI,  and  the  U.S.  Treasury—opened  spurious \ncriminal  and  civil  investigations  into  the  Greenhouse  Gas \nReduction  Fund  and  pressured  Citibank  into  “voluntarily” \nfreezing  Plaintiffs’  accounts  even  though  the  government \nlacked probable cause to impose such a freeze.  EPA then \nattempted to take back Plaintiffs’ money by “terminating” all \neight grants, comprising the entire $20 billion congressionally \nmandated program, 24 hours before the government was due in \ndistrict court for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ application for a \ntemporary  restraining  order.    Those  unprecedented  and \nunfounded actions were part of EPA’s hunt for reasons to shut \ndown the congressionally mandated program and claw back the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 32 of 92\n2 \nfunding  that  had  already  been  disbursed  to  Plaintiffs  and \ncommitted to infrastructure projects.  EPA’s termination letter \nclaims the agency conducted a “comprehensive review” but \nfails to identify any contract breach or violation of law by \nPlaintiffs.   \nSo far, EPA has succeeded in depriving Plaintiffs of access \nto their funding for six months.  The freeze has already caused \nPlaintiffs to default on promised loans and scuttled affordable \nhousing and energy projects implementing Congress’s vision.  \nEPA has done all that without presenting to any court any \ncredible  evidence  or  coherent  reason  that  could  justify  its \ninterference  with  Plaintiffs’  money  and  its  sabotage  of \nCongress’s law. \nPlaintiffs challenge EPA’s action to gut the Greenhouse \nGas  Reduction  Fund  as  contrary  to  the  Constitution’s \nseparation  of  powers.    Fundamental  to  our  “constitutional \nsystem  of  separation  of  powers”  is  the  “settled,  bedrock \nprinciple[]” that neither the President nor his  “subordinate \nexecutive agencies” may “decline to follow a statutory mandate \nor prohibition simply because of policy objections.”  In re \nAiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259, 267 (D.C. Cir. 2013); U.S. \nConst. art. I, §§ 1, 9, cl. 7; U.S. Const. art. II, § 3.  Yet that is \njust what EPA decided to do and has begun to effectuate here.  \nThe record strongly supports the district court’s determination \nthat EPA has frozen and attempted to repossess billions of \ndollars’ worth of lawfully spent money for no substantiated \nreason  other  than  disagreements  with  Congress’s  policy \ndetermination—grounds  that  are  entirely  inapposite  and \ninadequate, and that the government does not defend here.  The \nagency has no lawful basis—nor even a nonfrivolous assertion \nof  any  basis—to  interfere  with  funding  that,  pursuant  to \nCongress’s instructions, already belongs to Plaintiffs, who in \nturn have committed it to energy infrastructure development \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 33 of 92\n3 \nand advanced manufacturing projects according to Congress’s \nplan. \nThat  constitutional  violation  alone  justifies  the  district \ncourt’s injunction.  The injunction is independently warranted \nby the arbitrary and capricious character of EPA’s actions.  \nPlaintiffs  challenge  EPA’s  taking  of  their  funds  under  an \nirrational process with only pretextual justifications.  That is a \nquintessential APA claim that belongs in the district court, and \non which Plaintiffs are likely to succeed. \nDefendants insist that this is a government contract dispute \nthat we must dismiss because, under the Tucker Act, only the \nCourt of Federal Claims has authority to decide it.  Our Tucker \nAct precedents do not support that contention.  They direct us \nto analyze whether a claim is “at its essence” contractual and, \nif it is, to cede jurisdiction to the Court of Claims for its expert \n“knowledge  of  the  government  contracting  process.”  \nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 76, 78 (D.C. \nCir. 1985).  That analysis, turning on the source of the right \nPlaintiffs assert and the nature of the relief they seek—here, \nconstitutional and statutory claims to retain already-disbursed \nfunds to which they remain lawfully entitled—confirms the \njurisdiction of the district court.  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 \nF.2d  959,  968-69  (D.C.  Cir.  1982).    The  majority \nacknowledges the district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional  claims.    And  nothing  in  the  Tucker  Act  or \nbinding precedent interpreting it supports the majority’s view \nthat Plaintiffs’ APA claim is transformed into a contract claim \nand ousted from the district court’s jurisdiction merely because \nit seeks to prevent EPA’s capricious interference with funds \nthat Plaintiffs obtained through and must spend consistently \nwith a contract.  Maj. Op. 16-18. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 34 of 92\n4 \nIn characterizing this case as merely a contract dispute \nsubject to the Tucker Act’s jurisdictional bar, the majority \nbaselessly strips the district court of authority to decide these \nimportant claims.  The majority holds that a plaintiff cannot \nbring an arbitrary and capricious challenge to any government \naction  that  affects  something  of  value  that  was  originally \nobtained by contract.  Maj. Op. 16-18.  Doing so undercuts the \nConstitution’s  and  the  APA’s  checks  on  the  Executive’s \nillegitimate  seizure  of  Plaintiffs’  funds  and  subversion  of \nCongress’s will.  The government’s Tucker Act defense is \nespecially pernicious here.  Dismissal of this case presumably \nwill enable the government to carry out its announced plan to \nimmediately and irrevocably seize Plaintiffs’ funds.  At best, in \nthe unlikely event the government refrains from immediately \ndraining Plaintiffs’ frozen accounts, the further delay involved \nin reinitiating litigation in the Court of Federal Claims will \nitself irreparably harm the infrastructure projects that cannot \nmove  forward  and  may  fail  without  funding.    In  these \ncircumstances,  “[i]t  is  no  overstatement  to  say  that  our \nconstitutional  system  of  separation  of  powers  w[ill]  be \nsignificantly altered” by “allow[ing] executive . . . agencies to \ndisregard federal law in the manner asserted in this case.”  \nAiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 267. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund \nIn 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act.  The \nAct establishes the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund and directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nto distribute that money for investment in projects to deploy \nsolar and electric energy technology throughout the country, \nespecially  in  low-income  and  disadvantaged  communities.  \nPub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, 2065-67 (2022) (codified \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 35 of 92\n5 \nat 42 U.S.C. § 7434).  The program was intended to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, improve air quality, and “improve \nhealth outcomes, lower energy costs, and create high-quality \njobs for Americans—all while strengthening [the] country’s \neconomic  competitiveness  and  ensuring  energy  security.”  \nNotice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) 3 (J.A. 1735).   \nAchieving  that  vision  would  “require  a  tremendous \namount of financing and private capital for greenhouse gas- \nand air pollution-reducing projects across the country.”  Id.  \nBecause the private sector has historically been hesitant to \ninvest  in  clean  energy  projects,  Congress  designed  the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund  to  finance  clean  energy \nprojects “in partnership with, and by leveraging investment \nfrom,  the  private  sector.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434(c)(3)(A).  \nSpecifically, Congress directed EPA to spend $20 billion by \nSeptember 2024 to fund nonprofit financial institutions, which \nin turn must use the funds either to recruit private investment \nfor clean energy programs or to assist community projects to \nreduce air pollution.  Id. § 7434(a)(2)-(3), (c)(3). \nPursuant  to  Congress’s  directive,  in  July  2023,  EPA \ncreated two funding programs: the National Clean Investment \nFund (NCIF) program, to identify and deploy nonprofit lenders \nto use public seed money to attract private investment for tens \nof  thousands  of  energy-efficient  affordable  housing, \ntransportation, and electricity projects throughout the country; \nand the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) \nprogram, to identify and deploy nonprofit organizations to use \npublic seed money to enable community lenders to invest in \nclean  energy  projects  in  low-income  and  underinvested \ncommunities.   \nEPA conducted a rigorous, competitive selection process, \nwhich included review of applicants’ detailed program plans \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 36 of 92\n6 \nand budgets, organizational capacity, and experience managing \nthird-party  capital  and  financial  risk.    EPA  selected  eight \nnonprofits—lenders  and  community  organizations—capable \nof carrying out those aims.  The approved workplans and \nbudgets of the applicants EPA selected describe how those \norganizations  will  use  the  federal  funds  they  have  since \nreceived to expand access to—and recruit private investment \nfor—affordable  construction  and  renovation  of  energy-\nefficient businesses, schools, municipal buildings, healthcare \nfacilities, public housing, and transportation, particularly in \nrural, Tribal, and low-income areas.  \nIn compliance with the September 2024 deadline Congress \nimposed, EPA obligated the grant funds for both programs by \nthe summer of 2024.  To enable the grantees to recruit private \ninvestment—as  Congress  required,  42  U.S.C. \n§ 7434(c)(3)(A)—EPA deposited the grant funds in accounts \nopened in the grantees’ names at Citibank.  Unlike EPA’s \ntraditional  disbursement  system,  that  structure  gave  the \ngrantees title to the full amount of the award funds up front, \nallowing those funds to serve as assets for the grantees to rely \non to raise private capital by reducing financial risk for private \ninvestments.  See Impact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 7-14. \nThe Plaintiff grantees’ legal title to their award funds is \nspelled out in Account Control Agreements between EPA, \nCitibank, and each grantee.  Those agreements specify that \nCitibank “maintains the Accounts for the [grantee]” and state \nthat the grantee is “the Bank’s customer with respect to the \nAccounts  and [] the entitlement holder with respect to all \nfinancial assets credited . . . to the Accounts.”  Account Control \nAgreement § 1 (J.A. 1144).  The Account Control Agreements \naccordingly  direct  that  Citibank  “shall  comply  with  all \ninstructions” it receives from the grantees.  Id. § 2 (J.A. 1145).  \nThe grantees’ title to the award funds is also reflected in \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 37 of 92\n7 \nCitibank’s Financial Agency Agreement with Treasury, which \nrequires Citibank to act as the government’s “financial agent” \nto achieve Congress’s goal by, among other things, establishing \n“accounts in the names of the three NCIF and five CCIA grant \nrecipients” and maintaining a “customer relationship” with \neach grantee.  Financial Agency Agreement Ex. A § I.A.1 \n(J.A. 2145). \nUnder those agreements, EPA retained a security interest \nin the grantees’ award funds that allows it to assert control over \nthe money in certain circumstances if—and only if—it issues a \nNotice of Exclusive Control, which it undisputedly has not \ndone.  Form of Notice of Exclusive Control (J.A. 1152); Oral \nArg.  Tr.  28:6-22.    EPA  has  only  an  unexercised  security \ninterest; it does not own the funds in the grantees’ accounts.  \nSee United States v. Whiting Pools, Inc., 462 U.S. 198, 209-10 \n(1983); Cent. Va. Cmty. Coll. v. Katz, 546 U.S. 356, 392 n.8 \n(2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (noting the distinction between \n“the government possess[ing] merely a secured interest in the \nproperty” and “own[ing] the funds”). \nIn addition to serving as the mechanism for conveying to \nthe grantees legal title to the award funds, the financial agent \nstructure affords EPA greater oversight of the grantees’ use of \nthe  funds  than  it  would  have  had  under  the  default \ndisbursement system:  While EPA’s traditional disbursement \nsystem reports only the amounts withdrawn by the recipient \nand the remaining award funds, the financial agent structure \nallows EPA real-time “view access,” enabling it to see the \ngrantees’ and their subrecipients’ accounts to follow how much \nthey are spending, with all amounts broken down by budget \ncategory, and to see income in the form of portfolio earnings \nand loan repayments.  Bafford Decl. ¶ 33 (J.A. 372).   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 38 of 92\n8 \nOther  oversight  mechanisms  provide  further,  detailed \nconfirmation of grantees’ lawful use of their funds.  Grantees \nprovide extensive reporting to EPA on their spending.  They \nmake  quarterly,  semi-annual,  and  annual  written  reports \nregarding their transactions and progress against their EPA-\napproved  workplans,  plus  quarterly  conflict-of-interest \nreporting.  They attend oversight, planning, and compliance \nmeetings with EPA at least weekly.  They submit to EPA \nwithdrawal certifications attesting to the propriety of each draw \nrequest to Citibank and to its necessity for their workplan.  And \ngrantees are also subject to third-party financial audits and \naudits for federal grant compliance.  Id. ¶ 35 (J.A. 372-73). \nThe plaintiffs in this suit are five of the eight NCIF and \nCCIA grantees, as well as several of their subgrantees.  Since \nmid-2024, they have been putting the grant money to work, \ncommitting to loans for projects around the country that will, \nfor example:  \n•  develop  and  renovate  hundreds  of  energy-efficient \naffordable housing units;  \n•  fund low-cost loans to small business and homeowners \nto finance heating and cooling systems and backup \nbattery storage;  \n•  build a fleet of 500 American-made electric trucks to \nbe conveniently and affordably available for lease by \nsmall businesses and independent contractors; and  \n•  provide backup power sources to rural hospitals to \nreduce the risks of harm to patients due to power \noutages.   \nThose projects will help cut energy costs for consumers and \nsmall  businesses,  create  jobs,  ameliorate  the  affordable-\n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 39 of 92\n9 \nhousing crisis, and improve air quality in low-income and less \ndeveloped communities.   \nPlaintiffs’  projects  provide  benefits  to  people  and \ncommunities the value of which is many times greater than \ntheir  cost  to  the  public  fisc.    Congress  structured  these \nprograms to enable each dollar of public funding spent to \nattract multiple dollars of private funding.  One Plaintiff, for \nexample, estimates that it will generate up to $4 of private \ninvestment for every $1 of federal funds invested in projects.  \nAnother Plaintiff’s workplan obligates it to mobilize $14 of \nprivate investment for every $1 of federal funding awarded to \nthe Plaintiff.  As of December 2024, it had already achieved a \nprivate-public capital mobilization ratio of nearly 7:1.  But \nthose projects—as well as many of the Plaintiffs’ ability even \nto  remain  in  business—cannot  continue  without  Plaintiffs’ \naccess  to  the  funds  EPA  awarded  them.    Plaintiffs’ \nvulnerability  to  the  freeze  of  their  federal  grant  money  is \nparticularly acute given that many of the Plaintiffs were formed \nspecifically to participate in the grant programs and as such do \nnot have other sources of funding.   \nB.  EPA’s Actions \nEPA’s campaign to seize the grant money already owned \nby Plaintiffs began shortly after the new administration took \noffice, in response to its directives.  On January 20, 2025, \nPresident Trump issued Executive Order 14154.  Exec. Order \n14154, 90 Fed. Reg. 8353, 8357 (Jan. 29, 2025).  Section 7 of \nthe Executive Order, entitled “Terminating the Green New \nDeal,”  directs  “[a]ll  agencies”  to  “immediately  pause  the \ndisbursement  of  funds  appropriated  through  the  Inflation \nReduction Act of 2022.”  Id.  Reacting to the E.O., EPA froze \n“all disbursements for unliquidated obligations funded by . . . \nthe Inflation Reduction Act”—i.e., legally binding funding \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 40 of 92\n10 \ncommitments that had not yet been disbursed.

Supp. 3d 100, 130-31 (D.D.C. 2025)—EPA \ncould not freeze the funds that Congress had appropriated for \nthe NCIF and CCIA programs because those funds had already \nbeen  given  to  Plaintiffs  and  were  held  in  their  Citibank \naccounts.  Nonetheless, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin made \nclear his intent to take back the funds disbursed through those \nprograms.   \nOn February 12, Zeldin released a public statement video \nin which he described the NCIF and CCIA grant programs as a \n“scheme” by the “Biden EPA” to “park[]” 20 billion dollars at \nan outside financial institution in order to “obligate all of the \nmoney in a rush job with reduced oversight.”  Lee Zeldin \n(@EPALeeZeldin),  X  (Feb.  12,  2025,  7:52  PM), \nhttps://perma.cc/PU5X-PUBP.  Zeldin asserted that the bank \n“must immediately return” the money in Plaintiffs’ Citibank \naccounts so that EPA could “reassume responsibility” over the \nfunds.  Id.  He also vowed to refer the grant programs for \ninvestigation by EPA’s Office of the Inspector General and the \nJustice  Department  to  redress  “[t]he  days  of  irresponsibly \nshoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the \nname of environmental justice and climate equity.”  Id.  The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 41 of 92\n11 \nnext day, EPA issued a press release repeating those statements \nand  reiterating  that  “Administrator  Zeldin  is  calling  for \ntermination  of  the  financial  agent  agreement,  and  for  the \nimmediate return of the entire fund balance to the United States \nTreasury  to  ensure  EPA  oversight.”    Press  Release,  EPA, \nAdministrator  Zeldin  Announces  that  Billions  of  Dollars \nWorth of “Gold Bars” Have Been Located at Outside Financial \nInstitution (Feb. 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/48VN-PLYE. \nFive days later, the Department of Justice took up Zeldin’s \ncause, seeking to use its criminal prosecutorial powers to cut \noff Plaintiffs’ access to their funds despite the lack of probable \ncause to do so.  The Justice Department first asked the Chief of \nthe  Criminal  Division  of  the  Washington,  D.C.,  U.S. \nAttorney’s  Office,  Denise  Cheung,  to  open  a  criminal \ninvestigation into whether the NCIF and CCIA grants had been \n“unlawfully” awarded, so that the government could prevent \nthe “contract awardees [from] continu[ing] to draw down” their \nfunds from their Citibank accounts.

POST (Feb. 18, 2025), https://perma.cc/8NMY-DRWE.  \nWhen Cheung informed the Justice Department that probable \ncause to open a grand jury investigation did not exist, the \nJustice Department asked her to instead issue a letter requesting \nthat Citibank freeze Plaintiffs’ funds.   \nWhile Cheung worked in coordination with the FBI to \ndraft the freeze request letter to Citibank, she informed the \nJustice Department that the government lacked probable cause \nto believe that Plaintiffs’ accounts were subject to government \nseizure.  Id.  The FBI, too, expressed “concern about the current \nlack of evidence of any apparent crime and the need to send out \nany such freeze letter.”  Id.  Despite that advice, the FBI sent \nthe freeze letter to Citibank that night, “recommend[ing]” that \nCitibank freeze each of the NCIF and CCIA grantees’ and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 42 of 92\n12 \nsubgrantees’ accounts for 30 days.  FBI Freeze Ltr. (J.A. 99-\n103).   \nShortly after the letter went out, then-U.S. Attorney for the \nDistrict  of  Columbia,  Ed  Martin,  directed  Cheung  to \nimmediately send a second letter to Citibank ordering—rather \nthan  merely  recommending—that  it  freeze  the  accounts \npursuant to a criminal investigation by the Justice Department.  \nWhen Cheung explained that the evidence was insufficient to \nsupport such a letter, she was asked to resign for refusing to \nsend the letter.  She resigned the next day. \nUndeterred, Martin personally submitted a seizure warrant \napplication  to  a  D.C.  magistrate  judge.    Spencer  S.  Hsu, \nMaxine Joselow & Nicolás Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe \namid Pushback from Judge, Prosecutors, WASH. POST (Feb. \n27, 2025), https://perma.cc/E2JR-G4GF.  The judge rejected \nthe seizure warrant application as unsupported by probable \ncause.  Id.  Around the same time, the Deputy Attorney General \nasked at least one other U.S. Attorney’s office to open a grand \njury investigation into the NCIF and CCIA grant programs and \nseek a court-ordered bank freeze, but, like Cheung, those other \nprosecutors refused the requests as unsupported.  Id.  As the \ngovernment eventually told the district court, the “effort to . . . \nput  a  criminal  freeze  on  the  money”  was  “obviously” \nunsuccessful “because that didn’t happen.”  Mar. 12 TRO Hr’g \nTr. 26:5-9 (J.A. 199).  \nDespite  having  received  multiple,  independent \nassessments that there was no probable cause to believe that \n“any apparent crime” had been committed in connection with \nPlaintiffs’ funds, EPA continued without basis to press for \ninvestigations  of  Plaintiffs,  and  then  pointed  to  the  very \nexistence of those investigations as if they supported its efforts \nto indefinitely prevent Plaintiffs from accessing their funds.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 43 of 92\n13 \nEPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator Chad McIntosh referred \nthe “GGRF program” to the EPA Office of Inspector General \nfor a “full investigation” into what he termed a “pattern of \nreckless financial management, blatant conflicts of interest, \nastonishing  sums  of  tax  dollars  awarded  to  unqualified \nrecipients,  and  severe  deficiencies  in  regulatory  oversight \nunder the prior administration.”  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG 2 (J.A. \n107).  Fifteen minutes after sending the referral letter, in an act \nof  arrant  bootstrapping,  McIntosh  forwarded  the  letter  to \nCitibank with a baseless cover email characterizing the GGRF \nprogram  as  being  “riddled  with  self-dealing,  conflicts  of \ninterest,  extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients,  improperly \nreduced government oversight, and much more.”  Mar. 2 EPA \nLtr. to Citibank (J.A. 105). \nMeanwhile, Citibank continued to block disbursements of \nPlaintiffs’ funds.  But—given the government’s lack of success \nin convincing any prosecutor or  court that probable cause \nexisted  to  support  a  criminal  freeze—that  was  only  a \n“voluntar[y] pause[]” pursuant to the FBI’s “recommendation” \nfrom two weeks earlier.  Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. \n106).  To ensure that Citibank continued the freeze, EPA asked \nTreasury to instruct Citibank “not to disburse funds from any \nof the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, \nMarch 9, 2025.”  Mar. 4 Treasury Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 111); \nsee also Opp’n to Mot. for TRO 7, Climate United Fund v. \nCitibank, No. 25-cv-698, Dkt.

Mar. 4 EPA Ltr. to Climate \nUnited (J.A. 675). \nBy March 9, as Treasury’s funding freeze directive was set \nto expire, Justice Department officials worked with EPA and \nTreasury to craft emails to Citibank that would achieve the \ngovernment’s “short-term objective [] to prevent disbursement \nof  the  grant  funds”  by  “making  reference  to  the  ongoing \ncriminal investigation and EPA’s civil investigation” into the \nGreenhouse  Gas  Reduction  Fund.

The Justice Department \nofficials  admitted  that  those  investigations  had  not \n“uncover[ed] . . . criminal conduct or other improprieties” that \ncould justify the government’s interference with Plaintiffs’ \nmoney but advised that, before the government would have to \ndefend the freeze in court, it would “make . . . arguments about \nhow those claims sound in contract and should be pursued in \nanother forum.”  Id. \nThe Justice Department recognized that, “[a]t some point, \nwe will need to raise  defenses, but the criminal and civil \ninvestigations may fill that out over the intervening period.”  Id.  \nThat is, in the Justice Department’s candid estimation, the \ngovernment had not turned up any wrongdoing that could \njustify its action to “prevent disbursement of the grant funds.”  \nId.  Rather, it pursued criminal and civil investigations in the \nhopes of uncovering “criminal conduct or other improprieties” \nthat could justify freezing Plaintiffs’ accounts. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 45 of 92\n15 \nIn response to the Justice Department’s instructions, EPA \nsent a letter to Citibank the next day instructing it to “pause the \nprocessing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts \nuntil further notice.”  Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 65).  \nEPA  stated  that  it  was  “working  to  review  and  develop \nadditional  account  controls  to  address  concerns  regarding \npotential  fraud  and/or  conflicts  of  interest  related  to  the \n[GGRF], including based on incoming responses to oversight \nquestions EPA issued to grant recipients on March 4, 2025,” \nand asserted that “[t]he GGRF is also the subject of an ongoing \ncriminal investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice and an \ninvestigation by the EPA Office of Inspector General (OIG).”  \nId.    EPA  advised  Citibank  that,  until  “additional  account \ncontrols are developed and implemented . . . and given the \nongoing investigations into the GGRF, it is critical that the \nBank  not  resume  processing  payment  instructions  for  the \nGGRF accounts.”  Id.  EPA stated further that “[t]his interim \naccount  control  will  be  rescinded  as  soon  as  reasonably \npracticable once EPA completes its review and implements \nadditional account controls through additional instructions as \nnecessary.”  Id.   \nMeanwhile, Plaintiffs had already been unable to access \nthe money in their bank accounts for over two weeks—a period \nthat has now stretched to more than six months.  And because \nthe terms of the grant awards generally prohibited Plaintiffs \nfrom withdrawing funds unless they would be spent in the \nfollowing fourteen business days, Plaintiffs were starting to run \nout of money to make payroll, pay the rent on their offices, and \npay third-party contractors for essential auditing, legal, and IT \nsecurity  services.    On  top  of  that,  without  access  to  their \nfunding, they would soon be unable to meet their commitments \nunder loans for projects they had already agreed to finance.  \nSome of those loan payments could be requested by borrowers \nat any time; if borrowers requested a loan draw-down while \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 46 of 92\n16 \nPlaintiffs could not access their funds, Plaintiffs would be \nforced to default on those loans, imperiling the projects.   \nPlaintiffs remained unable to access the money in their \naccounts.  They repeatedly requested an explanation from EPA \nor Citibank as to why their funds were inaccessible.  They \nreceived no substantive reply.  Climate United, for example, \nsent three emails, left a voicemail, and mailed a hard-copy \nletter to Citibank between February 19 and March 3 before \nfinally receiving a response stating only that Citibank had \n“received  [Climate  United’s]  correspondence”  and  was \n“awaiting further guidance” from EPA.  Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 42-\n51 (J.A. 376-78).  When Climate United contacted EPA on \nFebruary 20, the  agency at first offered Climate United  a \nmeeting the following week, only to reschedule the meeting \nthree times before cancelling it and becoming entirely non-\nresponsive to Climate United’s efforts to get in touch.   \nAt the same time that EPA was refusing to respond to \nPlaintiffs’  requests  for  information,  Zeldin  made  multiple \npublic statements in which he claimed to have “seen [] a lot of \nself-dealing,  a  lot  of  conflicts  of  interest,”  described  the \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund as a “clear-cut case of waste \nand abuse” and a “criminal” scheme, and vowed that EPA was \n“not going to rest” until it had “recover[ed]” the grant awards.1 \nAfter three weeks of being kept in the dark without access \nto their funds, Plaintiffs “had no choice but to sue.”  Mar. 12 \nTRO Hr’g Tr. 14:8 (J.A. 187).

Climate United Fund \nv. Citibank, 775 F. Supp. 3d 335, 343 (D.D.C. 2025); J.A. 390-\n91 (termination letter).  The government then argued that the \ncase should be dismissed as moot because the relief Plaintiffs \nsought—an injunction preventing EPA from terminating the \nawards—was  no  longer  available,  as  EPA  had  already \npurported to terminate the awards.   \nRejecting EPA’s attempt to moot the case, the district \ncourt granted a temporary restraining order.  It found that EPA \nhad failed to provide any logical explanation for terminating \nPlaintiffs’ grant awards.  Climate United, 775 F. Supp. 3d at \n346-48.  Instead, in declarations and two live hearings before \nthe district court, EPA cited allegations of criminal activity and \nfraud that the court held were unsupported by any credible \nevidence.  Id. at 347-48; see also id. at 346 (“EPA Defendants \nproffered no evidence to support their basis for the termination \n. . . .”).  Rather than proffer any credible evidence, EPA merely \npointed to the ongoing investigations by EPA’s Office of the \nInspector General, the Department of Justice, and the FBI—\neach  of  which  EPA  had  instigated  based  on  the  same \nunsubstantiated allegations for which it could not provide any \ncredible evidence to the district court.

And I \nstill don’t.  I mean, here we are weeks in, and as far as I—\nyou’re still unable to proffer me any information with regard to \nany kind of investigation, malfeasance.”).   \nIn fact, once it had to answer in court, EPA abandoned its \nprevious arguments that the terminations were necessary due \nto  “substantial  concerns  regarding  program  integrity”  and \n“programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse.”  Opp’n to Mot. for \nTRO  21.    Instead,  EPA  maintained  that  its  “bases  for \ntermination were the grants’ structure and terms” and that its \ntermination decision “reflected no more than a decision based \non  reasons  of  policy,”  not  anything  to  do  with  Plaintiffs’ \n“noncompliance” or “conduct.”  Opp’n to PI 34-35, 38 (J.A. \n503-04,  507)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted);  see  also \nClimate United, 778 F.

Id at 115-16. \nBy  the  time  the  district  court  granted  the  preliminary \ninjunction in mid-April, Plaintiffs’ inability to access their \nfunding  threatened  to  permanently  unravel  projects  that \ndepended on funding commitments they had incurred before \nEPA’s actions to undo the GGRF.  A project to renovate 192 \naffordable housing units in Virginia could lose its $4 million in \ncommitted Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD)  funding  if  a  subgrantee  cannot  fulfill  its  funding \nobligations by September.  Donovan Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 437-38).  \nProjects to construct a community health center in New Jersey \nand to renovate a historic hotel into 63 rental apartments in \nrural Iowa were slated to lose their state tax credits and collapse \nif they did not receive a subgrantee’s planned funding by July.  \nMoon Decl. ¶¶ 19, 25-26 (J.A. 465-67).  And construction of \n302  affordable  housing  units  in  Texas  and  236  units  in \nMaryland will not move forward, and will eventually collapse, \nwithout a subgrantee’s committed funding.  Donovan Decl. \n¶ 17 (J.A. 436-37). \nThose harms have only continued to mount as the funding \nfreeze has persisted, and for some projects, it is likely already \ntoo late.  Due to one subgrantee’s inability to access its grant \nfunds, a 106-unit affordable housing renovation lost its state \ntax credits in May, increasing the project’s cost and placing the \nproject in jeopardy.  Mayopoulos Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Climate United, \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 50 of 92\n20 \nNo. 25-cv-698,  Dkt.  No.  112-1  (D.D.C.  May  12,  2025) \n(hereinafter Mayopoulos Supp. Decl.).  Another project to \nconstruct a 160-home subsidized rental apartment community \nin Detroit most likely lost its critical HUD housing assistance \ncommitment because of a subgrantee’s inability to provide a \npromised $4 million bridge loan in June.  Id. at ¶¶ 7-8; Brown \nDecl. ¶ 18 (J.A. 437).  And a $34 million project to build 90 \nrental homes in Texas was projected to fall through due to a \nsubgrantee’s inability to provide its $3.6 million of committed \nfunding by the end of June.  Moon Decl. ¶¶ 20-21 (J.A. 465). \nIn  addition  to  undermining  existing  projects,  EPA’s \nactions will soon put many of the Plaintiffs themselves out of \nbusiness, preventing accomplishment of the projects Congress \nintended  them  to  fund.    Without  access  to  their  funding, \nPlaintiffs are unable to make payroll, pay their bills, or keep \ncurrent on their rent.  Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 117-\n20.  Due to EPA’s interference with Plaintiffs’ ability to make \npayroll, many employees have started looking for other jobs, \nleft voluntarily, or been laid off.  For instance, one Plaintiff has \nlaid off or lost approximately 50% of its staff, and one of its \nsubgrantees was “forced to act financially as though the GGRF \naward  does  not  exist”  by  laying  off  36  of  its  employees.  \nMayopoulos Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 2-3.  And because Plaintiffs cannot \npay their bills, third-party contractors have started to withdraw \nessential  services,  including  critical  accounting,  financial \nmanagement, and award compliance services.  Simply put, \nwithout access to their funds, Plaintiffs cannot keep their doors \nopen, much less honor their loan commitments.   \nMore harmful still, faced with EPA’s threats to claw back \nPlaintiffs’  funds,  existing  partners  have  begun  to  shun \nPlaintiffs’ funding offers, pulling out of near-final deals and \nstopping working on Plaintiffs’ projects.  After eight weeks of \nnegotiations, an Alaska-based community finance institution \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 51 of 92\n21 \nhad agreed to a $10 million loan from one of the Plaintiffs; all \nthat  was  left  to  officially  close  the  deal  was  the  board’s \napproval.    Following  EPA’s  actions,  the  board  refused  to \napprove  the  loan.    That  same  plaintiff  had  completed \nnegotiations with a local green bank in the Midwest to help \nfinance  a  different  project,  with  only  board  approval \noutstanding.  The board met the day after Zeldin’s February 12 \ncomments on X and voted against the loan because of Zeldin’s \npublic  threats  and  vow  to  end  the  NCIF  program.    A \nphilanthropic entity interested in investing $250 million in a \npartnership with one of the Plaintiffs broke off discussions \nfollowing EPA’s actions.  Co-investment and collaboration is \ncritical to Plaintiffs’ ability to carry out Congress’s directive to \nefficiently finance projects to benefit the public by lowering \n“greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in \npartnership  with,  and  by  leveraging  investment  from,  the \nprivate sector.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(3)(A). \nDISCUSSION \nAn  accurate  understanding  of  the  program  Congress \nenacted, together with the complete lack of evidence to support \nEPA’s false assertions of improper use or deficient oversight \nof  federal  expenditures,  confirms  that  the  district  court’s \ndecision to preliminarily enjoin EPA’s unlawful actions is \nunassailable.  Based on nothing more than the President’s \nannounced  vendetta  against  the  “Green  New  Deal,”  EPA \ndetermined  to  cut  off  access  to  money  that  was  already \ndisbursed to Plaintiffs and that they were using—pursuant to \nCongress’s explicit directions as implemented by EPA—to \nexpand access to solar- and electric-powered housing, cars, \nbuildings, and power generation.  The Constitution does not \nallow the President or his subordinate executive agencies to \nunilaterally  decide  to  take  back  money  that  Congress  has \nappropriated and the agency already lawfully spent merely \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 52 of 92\n22 \nbecause  the  Executive  Branch  disagrees  with  Congress’s \npolicy choices.  Neither do the laws governing federal agencies \nallow them to initiate specious criminal investigations in hopes \nof  digging  up  pretextual  justifications  to  cover  up  that \nunconstitutional action, let alone rely on the very existence of \nthose investigations to interfere with Plaintiffs’ lawful use of \ntheir money. \nEPA’s violations of law are so clear that the agency hardly \ncontests  them.    And  the  imminent,  irreversible  harm  to \nPlaintiffs is incontrovertible.  These circumstances cry out for \npreliminary  injunctive  relief,  as  the  district  court  rightly \nrecognized.  The majority’s contrary conclusion accepts the \ngovernment’s gambit to strip district courts of jurisdiction over \nthe  government’s  blatant  violations  of  basic  principles  of \nconstitutional and administrative law.   \nPlaintiffs received the funds at issue here via federal grant \nawards.  Absent EPA’s unjustified interference, the money in \nPlaintiffs’ accounts is theirs to spend in conformity with the \nterms of the funding agreement.  The government has expressly \nand repeatedly disclaimed any allegation that Plaintiffs have \nviolated those terms.  Neither has EPA attempted to regain \ncontrol  of  the  money  by  asserting  its  security  interest  in \nPlaintiffs’ funds.   \nEPA has instead frozen and purported to terminate the \ngrant awards based on shifting, post-hoc, and unsupported \nallegations.  Plaintiffs thus challenge EPA’s actions as arbitrary \nand capricious, and based on pretextual justifications.  In no \nway is that claim “in essence” a contract claim over which the \ndistrict court lacks jurisdiction.  The  reality that Plaintiffs \nobtained the funds by government contract does not mean that \nclaims they raise against the government’s interference with \ntheir lawful use of those funds sound in contract.  Our binding \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 53 of 92\n23 \nprecedent makes clear that just because Plaintiffs “would have \nno  claims  to  assert”  if  they  had  never  received  the  funds \nthrough a grant does not mean that they assert a “contract \nright.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 \nF.4th 1099, 1110 (D.C. Cir. 2022).   \nThe court’s holding to the contrary is unsupportable.  The \ncourt falls short today in its Article III duty to independently \nsay what the law is and thereby hold the Executive Branch to \naccount.  Such “[a]bdication of responsibility is not part of the \nconstitutional design.”  Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. \n417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). \nA.  Likelihood of Success \n1. APA \nEPA’s conduct is arbitrary and capricious.  Agencies may \nnot offer “contrived reasons” for their decisions, Dep’t of Com. \nv. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019), nor can they make any \ndecision that “runs counter to the evidence before the agency, \nor is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference \nin view or the product of agency expertise,” Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass'n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983).  It is beyond dispute that an agency’s own \npatently  unfounded  criminal  investigations  against  private \ncompanies cannot be invoked to justify the factually baseless \nand legally unauthorized taking of the companies’ funds.  By \nall indications, that is exactly what EPA did here. \nFollowing the President’s instructions to cut off funding to \nclean energy projects, EPA vowed to “reassume responsibility” \nof the NCIF and CCIA grant funds.  To that end, without \nprobable cause to suspect any criminal wrongdoing related to \nthe grant programs, EPA—in coordination with the Justice \nDepartment  and  the  FBI—first  pressured  Citibank  into \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 54 of 92\n24 \nvoluntarily  freezing  Plaintiffs’  accounts  by  referring  to \n“possible  criminal  violations,”  including  “[c]onspiracy  to \ndefraud the United States” and “wire fraud.”  FBI Freeze Ltr. \n(J.A. 99-101).  Not satisfied that Citibank’s voluntary freeze \nwould  hold,  the  agencies  attempted  to  open  a  criminal \ninvestigation into the grants and impose a freeze of Plaintiffs’ \nfunds based on suspected criminal conduct.  When those efforts \ncame  to  nothing,  EPA  instructed  the  agency’s  Office  of \nInspector General to open a civil investigation, immediately \nsent the referral—including its unfounded allegations of “self-\ndealing, conflicts of interest, [and] extraordinarily unqualified \nrecipients,” J.A. 105—to Citibank, and instructed Citibank to \nkeep  the  accounts  frozen  until  EPA  was  able  to  establish \nsufficient account controls.   \nWhen  that  account  freeze  expired,  the  agencies  again \nreferenced “potential fraud” and ongoing criminal and civil \ninvestigations  to  Citibank  as  support  for  an  indefinite \ncontinuation of its account freeze, ostensibly to enable EPA to \nevaluate Plaintiffs’ responses to its oversight questions.  Mar. \n10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 65).  But the very next day—\nweeks before those responses were due, and mere hours before \na hearing on Climate United’s TRO motion—EPA used the 24-\nhour delay, which it had requested as a “professional courtesy,” \nto abruptly announce its putative termination of all the NCIF \nand CCIA awards.  EPA then argued that the court should \ndismiss Climate United’s suit as moot on the ground that EPA \nhad terminated its grant.   \nWhen EPA could not point the court to any evidence \nsupporting its allegations of fraud, Climate United, 775 F. \nSupp. 3d at 346-47, it changed its tune.  EPA argued to the \ndistrict court and then to us that it terminated the grants not \nbecause any “particular plaintiff has engaged in a particular act \nthat constitutes fraud,” but only because of “EPA’s lack of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 55 of 92\n25 \noversight tools to ensure that the money wasn’t abused.”  Oral \nArg. Tr. 103:9-15; see also Apr. 2 PI Hr’g Tr. 39:4-15 (J.A. \n868).  EPA insisted that its oversight concern did not in any \nway depend on Plaintiffs’ “noncompliance” or “conduct”—\ndespite the termination letters’ references to “fraud, waste, and \nabuse” as a basis for the termination.  PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. \n503-04, 507); Termination Ltr. (J.A. 390). \nEach of those actions is consistent with EPA’s unlawful \npursuit of a “short-term objective [] to prevent disbursement of \nthe grant funds” that had nothing to do with any valid concerns \nabout  fraud  or  oversight,  and  everything  to  do  with  the \nagency’s desire to carry out President Trump’s directive to \nblock  implementation  of  Congress’s  environmental  policy.  \nMar.  9  Emails,  https://perma.cc/84PV-RUQA.    That  is \ndemonstrated most clearly by EPA’s pursuit of criminal and \ncivil investigations that it hoped would “uncover . . . criminal \nconduct or other improprieties” to substantiate its asserted \njustifications for freezing Plaintiffs’ funds.  Id.  It pursued those \nbaseless (and fruitless) investigations against the advice of at \nleast two experienced federal prosecutors the EPA consulted \nand the ruling of a magistrate judge that there was no probable \ncause to believe any improper conduct had occurred. \nEqually revealing is EPA’s double-speak:  EPA claimed \npublicly and in communications to the parties that its actions \nwere justified because the program is a “criminal” scheme and \na “clear-cut case of waste and abuse” that is “riddled with self-\ndealing,  conflicts  of  interest,  extraordinarily  unqualified \nrecipients . . . and much more,” even as EPA insisted to the \ndistrict court, which rebuked it for utterly failing to substantiate \nthose allegations, and to our court, that it was not “accusing” \nand has never “accuse[d] the plaintiffs of waste, fraud and \nabuse.”  Apr. 2 PI Hr’g 39:12-13 (J.A. 868); Oral Arg. Tr. \n27:15-18.    Such  shifting  and  contradictory  representations \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 56 of 92\n26 \nfurther show that the oversight concerns EPA emphasizes as its \nsole  basis  for  terminating  the  awards  are  post-hoc  and \npretextual.  Oral Arg. Tr. 27:15-21. \nThe timing of the termination letters similarly undermines \nEPA’s purported oversight concerns.  Only the day before \nterminating the grants, EPA instructed Citibank to extend the \n“voluntary”  funding  freeze  while  it  waited  for  Plaintiffs’ \nresponses to its oversight questions—answers it claimed to \nneed in order to evaluate “concerns regarding potential fraud \nand/or conflicts of interest.”  Mar. 10 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. \n65).  Later that day, Climate United moved for a TRO to \nprevent  EPA  from  terminating  the  awards,  among  other \nrequested relief.  Instead of waiting for Plaintiffs’ responses to \nits  oversight  questions—which  EPA  had  given  Plaintiffs \nanother several weeks to submit—EPA abruptly terminated the \ngrants the next day, less than 24 hours before the district court’s \nscheduled TRO hearing.    \nThat  sequence  of  events—terminate  first,  gather  data \nlater—is emblematic of EPA’s approach throughout the events \nunderlying this litigation.  It is fundamentally at odds with the \nAPA’s requirement of reasoned decision making.  An agency \nmust, at a minimum, “examine the relevant data and articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \nBy EPA’s own admission, it decided to terminate the awards \nbefore gathering the relevant oversight data, just as it decided \nto freeze Plaintiffs’ money and launch criminal investigations \nwithout any reason to believe that Plaintiffs were engaged in \n“criminal conduct or other improprieties.”  Mar. 9 Emails.  At \nevery  turn,  EPA’s  actions  demonstrate  that  its  purported \nreasons for terminating the grant—its “substantial concerns \nregarding  program  integrity,  the  award  progress,  [and] \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 57 of 92\n27 \nprogrammatic  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,”  Gov.  Br.  33—are \nentirely pretextual.  Deciding the outcome before investigating \nthe facts, unleashing the government’s prosecutorial power on \nprivate citizens with no basis to think fraud or crime occurred \nand,  having  uncovered  no  evidence,  giving  contrived  and \ncontradictory  reasons  for  predetermined  and  unsupported \nagency action is quintessentially arbitrary and capricious.  See \nDep’t of Com., 588 U.S.at 782-85.   \nEPA argues that it had legitimate concerns about its ability \nto  ensure  that  the  grant  funds  were  being  spent  lawfully, \nmaking  its  decision  to  suddenly  terminate  the  awards \nreasonable.  Gov. Br. 33-34.  But the oversight issues it cites \nare contradicted by the record.  EPA’s explanation not only \n“runs counter to the evidence before the agency” and “is so \nimplausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view \nor the product of agency expertise,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43, but is patently pretextual.   \nEPA points to the use of Citibank as a financial agent, the \ndistribution of grant funding to subgrantee organizations, and \nmodification  of  the  agreement  between  the  presidential \nelection and inauguration as raising “serious concerns” about \nEPA’s ability to oversee Plaintiffs’ use of the funds.  Gov. Br. \n9-11.  From EPA’s telling, unqualified grantees were awarded \nenormous  sums  of  federal  grant  funding  with  virtually  no \noversight.  That narrative finds no support in the record. \nStart  with  EPA’s  allegation  that  Plaintiffs  are \n“extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients”  who  “had  no  prior \ntrack record.”  Mar. 2 EPA Ltr. to Citibank (J.A. 105); Gov. Br. \n6.    That  is  a  grave  mischaracterization.    Recipients  were \ncoalitions of some of the country’s most reputable nonprofits \nwith decades of relevant experience.  They formed coalitions, \nstructured as newly formed subsidiaries, to accommodate the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 58 of 92\n28 \ndemands of the role that Congress envisioned for the grantees.  \nThat organizational design enables the subsidiary to adopt \npolicies and structures most conducive to leveraging private \ncapital—one of Congress’s key goals for the program—while \nbenefitting from the experience and infrastructure of the parent \norganizations.  Bafford Decl. ¶ 8 (J.A. 363).  Climate United, \nfor instance, is a coalition of three nonprofits with thirty to fifty \nyears of experience each who have collectively managed nearly \n$30  billion  of  private  and  institutional  capital  to  increase \nenvironmental  sustainability.    Id.  ¶ 7  (J.A.  363).    Power \nForward  Communities  is  a  coalition  of  five  nonprofits—\nincluding household names like United Way and Habitat for \nHumanity—with more than a century of combined experience \nfinancing, managing,  and implementing affordable housing \nprojects.  Its coalition partners’ past projects total more than \n$100 billion and have successfully added approximately 1.5 \nmillion affordable homes and apartments across the United \nStates for Americans in need.  Mayopoulos Decl. ¶ 3 (J.A. \n452).   \nThose coalitions are led by people of proven experience \nand integrity.  Power Forward Communities itself is led by a \nformer  President  and  CEO  of  Fannie  Mae  who  was  also \nGeneral Counsel of Bank of America; one of its subgrantees is \nled by a former director of the U.S. Office of Management and \nBudget and HUD Secretary; and another of its subgrantees is \nled by a former Senior Vice President at Wells Fargo who also \nserved as Vice President at the Federal Reserve Bank of San \nFrancisco.    Such  impressive  leadership  and  proven  track \nrecords  make  the  coalitions  eminently  suited  to  fulfill \nCongress’s objectives.  It is disingenuous of EPA to insinuate \nthat  the  coalition  structure  implies  Plaintiffs’  lack  of \nqualifications when it is “common practice for established \norganizations to set up subsidiaries for specific projects and \nprograms”; coalition applicants were specifically invited to \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 59 of 92\n29 \napply for the grants by EPA; and the coalition partners and their \nleaders are extraordinarily qualified to administer the grant \nawards.  Bafford Decl. ¶ 8 (J.A. 363); NOFO at 6 (J.A. 1738).  \nNothing in the record materially disputes any of that.     \nNor  do  EPA’s  purported  concerns  about  conflicts  of \ninterest hold water.  Start with the example selected by the \nmajority.  Maj. Op. 6 & n.2.  The majority highlights that, in \nurging its Office of Inspector General to open an investigation \ninto the grant program, EPA’s Acting Deputy Administrator \nalleged that “Jahi Wise, the former director of the GGRF, \npersonally oversaw a $5 billion grant to his previous employer, \nthe Coalition for Green Capital [(CGC)]—without recusing \nhimself.”  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. 107).  But the record \nsquarely contradicts that allegation.  Consistent with “EPA \nOrder 5700.5A1, EPA’s Policy for Competition of Assistance \nAgreements, and the rigorous ethics and conflict-of-interest \nreview carried out by EPA during the review and selection \nprocess for GGRF funding . . . Mr. Wise was recused from \nreviewing, evaluating, selecting, or approving funding on any \ngrant competition for GGRF funding for which CGC submitted \nan application.”  Hopson Decl. ¶ 22 (J.A. 421).  That is, in \naddition  to  recusing  himself  from  CGC’s  application  for \nfunding, “Mr. Wise did not even review applications from \nCGC’s  competitors  for  GGRF  funds.”    Id.    Even  EPA \nrecognizes that its speculation about conflicts of interest does \nnot support its termination decision.  Indeed, after failing to \npresent the district court with any evidence of fraud, conflicts \nof interest, or anything even approaching “waste, fraud, and \nabuse,” EPA pivoted to argue that its decision to terminate the \ngrants was solely “based on reasons of policy” and did not have \nanything to do with Plaintiffs’ “noncompliance” or “conduct.”  \nPI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. 503-04, 507) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 60 of 92\n30 \nEPA’s characterization of the grants’ funding structure as \nan “unusual and apparently improper” “scheme [to] remove[] \n$20 billion from governmental oversight in the days, weeks, \nand  months  before  a  new  administration  took  office”  is \nsimilarly unfounded.  Mar. 2 Ltr. to EPA OIG (J.A. 107).  As \nexplained above, Plaintiffs received their awards as lump-sum \npayments which they held in accounts at Citibank, subject to a \nsecurity interest held by EPA.  That financial structure was \nspecifically chosen to enable Plaintiffs to carry out Congress’s \ndirective  to  act  “in  partnership  with,  and  by  leveraging \ninvestment from, the private sector.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(3).  \nIf the grant funds are to help attract private financing for clean \nenergy projects, either by recruiting private co-investors or \noffering credit enhancements that make projects less risky for \nprivate investors, the funds need to be Plaintiffs’ own assets \nand reflected on their balance sheets as such.  See Impact \nFinance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 9-14; Bafford Decl. ¶¶ 29, 32 \n(J.A.  370-72).    Under  EPA’s  standard  grant  disbursement \nsystem, in contrast, a recipient’s balance sheet reflects only the \nportions of the award that have already been expended, rather \nthan the full award amount.  Adherence to the agency’s default \npayment  system  would  have  impeded  Plaintiffs’  ability  to \nrecruit private capital.  To effectuate Congress’s direction, EPA \ninstead deposited the full award amount in Citibank accounts \nopened in Plaintiffs’ and their subgrantees’ names.  That way, \ntheir balance sheets reflected Plaintiffs’ ownership of the full \namount of the award, even as they drew down funds from the \naccount  only  as  needed  and  in  compliance  with  their \nobligations to fund projects and cover administrative costs.   \nThat funding mechanism was contemplated by EPA as \nearly  as  July  2023—long  before  any  potential  change  in \nadministration.    See  NOFO  55-56  (J.A.  1787-88) \n(contemplating  departures  from  standard  EPA  practice, \nincluding  a  “one-time  or  periodic  balance-sheet \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 61 of 92\n31 \ncapitalization(s)”).  And there is nothing improper about it.  \nRather, “federal financial agents” like Citibank are “routinely \nappointed”  and  are  specifically  authorized  by  statute.  \nTransactive Corp. v. United States, 91 F.3d 232, 236 (D.C. Cir. \n1996); 12 U.S.C. § 265.  Most relevant to EPA’s litigating \nposition,  the  financial  agent  structure  affords  EPA  more \noversight  than  the  agency’s  standard  payment  system.  \nCitibank’s interface displays these grantees’ and subgrantees’ \nexpenditures broken down by budget category and provides \nEPA with full, real-time view access into each of the grantees’ \nand subgrantees’ accounts.  Those oversight features are absent \nfrom EPA’s standard disbursement system, which reports only \nthe amount of money drawn down by the recipient.  EPA’s \ndetermination that the “prior administration’s designation of a \nfinancial agent . . . untenably reduced EPA’s oversight” has it \nbackwards.  Gov. Br. 10. \nIn  the  same  vein,  EPA  asserts  that,  because  some \nsubgrantees may distribute award funds to other entities, EPA \nlacks the “visibility to see how [the subgrantees are] making \nthose decisions or how that money is being used.”  Oral Arg. \nTr. 34:2-4; see also Gov. Br. 10.  That concern inexplicably \ndisregards  the  many  ways  in  which  EPA  can  oversee  the \nsubgrantees’ activities.  EPA approved detailed budgets and \nworkplans that specify how the subgrantees will use the grant \nmoney.  Just like the grantees, every subgrantee must certify, \nunder threat of “prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other \napplicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions,” that \neach requested withdrawal of funds from its Citibank account \nis “necessary to execute against the workplan for the Subaward \nAgreement  supported  with  EPA  funding.”    Subgrantee \nAccount  Control  Agreement,  Ex.  B  (J.A.  1189).    And \nsubgrantees’ progress against that workplan is tracked and \nreported in quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports to EPA.  \nFor  instance,  Rewiring  Community  Investment  Fund—a \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 62 of 92\n32 \nPower Forward Communities subgrantee—describes how its \ninability to access its funding will prevent it from fulfilling its \nobligations under its EPA-approved workplan, which include \n“establish[ing] a loan loss reserve to encourage lenders to \nprovide loans with significantly discounted interest rates” to \nhouseholds  for  energy-efficient,  clean  heating  and  cooling \nsystems.  Matusiak Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 447).  Moreover, many of \nthe subgrantees are financial institutions that are themselves \nsubject to extensive regulation and oversight by the Federal \nReserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, and state regulators.  JCF Ltr. \nat 3 (May 21, 2025).     \nTo the extent EPA takes issue with the fact that grantees \nmay provide “subgrants to others, who then pass it through to \nothers,”  that  is  the  structure  that  Congress,  not  the  prior \nadministration, chose to adopt.  See 42 U.S.C. § 7434(b)(2) \n(“The eligible recipient shall provide funding” to “entities that \nprovide financial assistance to qualified projects at the State, \nlocal, territorial, or Tribal level or in the District of Columbia, \nincluding community- and low-income-focused lenders and \ncapital providers.”). \nTellingly, when one of the Plaintiffs responded to EPA’s \nasserted concerns about its ability to oversee subgrantees by \nproposing restructuring the $770 million of its grant funding \nthat  was  slated  for  distribution  to  subgrantee  community \nlenders, EPA ignored it.  JCF Ltr. at 2-3.  Under the proposal, \nthe  vast  majority  of  the  Plaintiff’s  money  would  remain \nunspent in a segregated trust or escrow account that EPA could \nmonitor.  Instead of being distributed to the community lenders \nto lend directly, the funds would be used to secure the loans \nmade by those community lenders to small businesses and \ncommunities looking to finance clean energy projects.  In that \nway, the grant funds could have advanced the programs’ goals \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 63 of 92\n33 \nwhile largely staying put in an account monitored by EPA.  \nEPA did not respond to the letter, despite repeated follow-up \nfrom the Plaintiff.  Id. at 1.  That lack of engagement further \nsuggests that EPA’s purported oversight concerns are not the \nreal reason it terminated Plaintiffs’ grant awards. \nAt bottom, each of EPA’s specific examples of oversight \nconcerns  is  refuted  by  the  record.    And  its  broad-brush \nargument is simply untenable in light of the detailed oversight \nmechanisms available to EPA.  EPA’s assertions that it had \nsuch grave oversight concerns that it had to cancel the grant \nawards  overnight  run  aground  on  a  conceded  lack  of  any \nindication that Plaintiffs were out of compliance with the award \nterms, let alone that they were engaging in any conflicts of \ninterest, fraud, or criminal activity.  In addition to the real-time \nvisibility  Citibank  provides  EPA  into  Plaintiffs’  and  their \nsubgrantees’ accounts, EPA receives quarterly, semi-annual, \nand annual reports detailing Plaintiffs’ transactions, activities, \nprogress against their workplans, and expenditures by budget \ncategory, as well as mandatory quarterly conflict-of-interest \nreporting by Plaintiffs and their subgrantees.  Bafford Decl. \n¶ 35(a) (J.A. 373).  Before it purported to halt the program and \nitself disengaged from constructive communication, EPA had \nalso held meetings with Plaintiffs “at least weekly, and, at \ntimes, two to three times per week,” to discuss their “program \nplans,  reporting,  oversight,  and  compliance  with  the  EPA \nTerms and Conditions.”  Id. ¶ 35(b) (J.A. 373); Arabshahi \nDecl. ¶ 34 (J.A. 1981).  On top of those controls, Plaintiffs are \nsubject to third-party audits and to “transaction testing” by \nEPA, in which EPA conducts a “systematic examination and \nverification of every dollar spent by [the grantee] to ensure they \ncomply  with  the  grant’s  terms,  conditions,  and  applicable \nregulations.”  Bafford Decl. ¶ 35(g), (h) (J.A. 373). \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 64 of 92\n34 \nEPA and the majority make much of the fact that the grant \nawards were amended in December 2024 and January 2025, \nclaiming that these “last-minute” modifications in the waning \ndays of the Biden administration were implemented to “make \nit  more  difficult  for  the  government  to  terminate  the \nagreements.”    Maj.  Op.  5;  see  Gov.  Br.  10,  34.    EPA \nspecifically contends that the original terms of the awards \nallowed it to terminate them “based on [a] change in policy \npriorities,”  per  the  version  of  EPA’s  General  Terms  and \nConditions in place before October 2024—a contention the \nmajority credits.  Oral Arg. Tr. 102:17-25; see Maj. Op. 5 n. 1.  \nThat is incorrect.   \nThe original grant agreements, signed in August 2024—\nmonths  before  the  election—already  incorporated  the \ntermination  provision  from  EPA’s  now-operative  General \nTerms and Conditions.  Those General Terms and Conditions \nallow terminations of federal awards based on a change in \npolicy priorities only when that basis for termination is “clearly \nand unambiguously” set forth in the award agreement itself.  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), (b) (emphasis added).  (Neither the \nEPA nor the majority contends that the award agreement itself, \napart from the referenced regulation, allows the awards to be \nterminated  based  on  a  change  in  policy  priorities.)    The \nDecember 2024 amendment to the grant award thus did not \nalter the permissible bases for termination, which had never \nallowed termination for changed policy priorities. \nPlaintiffs’ original award agreements specifically stated \nthat,  “[n]otwithstanding  the  General  Term  and  Condition \n‘Termination,’ [otherwise in effect before October 1, 2024,] \nEPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement \nonly  as  specified  in  . . .  the  version  of  2  CFR  200.340 \napplicable to EPA grants as of July 1, 2024, pursuant to 89 Fed. \nReg. 55262 (July 3, 2024).”  J.A. 552 (emphasis added).  The \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 65 of 92\n35 \nversion of the regulation the awards incorporated from the \noutset was the one providing “that an agency may terminate a \nFederal award if it no longer effectuates the program goals or \nagency priorities (e.g. unilateral termination) but only when \nsuch language is clearly and unambiguously included in the \nterms and conditions of the award,” 89 Fed. Reg. 55,262, \n55,263 (July 3, 2024) (emphasis added).  \nEPA adopted that constraint pursuant to OMB’s invitation \nto  agencies  to  opt  into  the  revised  rule  before  its  default \nOctober  1,  2024,  effective  date.    As  of  July  2024,  EPA \nannounced in the Federal Register that it had “decided to apply \nthe  revised  version  of  2  CFR  200.340  to  EPA  financial \nassistance agreements awarded or amended to add funds on or \nafter July 1, 2024.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 55263.  The December \namendment thus imposed no new limit on EPA’s “control over \n[the] grant funding.”  Gov. Br. 10. \nThe timing of the amendment also is entirely innocuous.  \nEPA had explained shortly after the awards were announced in \nApril 2024 that it would share draft award terms that month, \nand that it “expected the terms to change based on awardee \nfeedback, to ensure they were clear and would be viable for \nawardee workplans.”  Bafford Decl. ¶ 19 (J.A. 367).  EPA \naccordingly planned to communicate a “final” set of award \nterms in late June, followed by an iterative process during the \nfall and winter of 2024 in which EPA would receive grantees’ \nsuggested  modifications  based  on  their  experience \nimplementing  the  programs.    Id.  ¶¶ 17-20  (J.A.  366-68).  \nDespite EPA’s and the majority’s insinuations to the contrary, \nnothing  about  the  timing  or  content  of  those  amendments \nsupports  Defendants’  assertion  that  they  were  intended  to \nreduce  the  agency’s  oversight  or  control  in  the  next \nadministration. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 66 of 92\n36 \nNeither  does  the  “gold  bars”  video,  which  Zeldin \nrepeatedly referenced in public comments smearing Plaintiffs, \nprovide any plausible basis for sincere oversight concerns on \nthe part of EPA’s new leadership.  In the November 2024 \nProject Veritas video, an EPA staffer is shown saying to a peer \non a Tinder date (who was surreptitiously filming him) that \nEPA was “trying to get the money out as fast as possible” \nbefore  Trump’s inauguration.  Lisa Friedman,  An Offhand \nRemark About Gold Bars, Secretly Recorded, Upended His \nLife, N.Y. TIMES (July 1, 2025), https://perma.cc/FHM4-94R9.  \nWhatever the staffer may have meant, those comments cannot \nhave  been  referring  to  awards  under  the  Greenhouse  Gas \nReduction Fund because those had been fully obligated as of \nAugust 2024 (in accordance with Congress’s September 2024 \ndeadline).  “EPA Awards $27B in Greenhouse Gas Reduction \nFund Grants to Accelerate Clean Energy Solutions, Combat the \nClimate Crisis, and Save Families Money,” EPA (Aug. 16, \n2024), https://perma.cc/Z7ER-RV7A.  Anyone with a basic \nfamiliarity with the GGRF program would understand that a \nvideo of a staffer’s bluster at a bar in November is irrelevant to \nthe grants at issue here. \nIn  sum,  the  record  makes  clear  that  EPA’s  abrupt \ntermination of the grant awards on the eve of the TRO hearing \ncannot  rationally  be  explained  by  reference  to  the  agency \nleadership’s professed oversight concerns.  That alone shows \nthat the agency violated the APA, as EPA’s explanation for its \ndecision to terminate the awards “runs counter to the evidence \nbefore” it.  State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43.  Far more troubling, \nEPA’s dogged pursuit of criminal investigations unsupported \nby probable cause and its unsubstantiated public accusations of \ncriminal activity strongly suggest that the agency’s professed \noversight concerns are pretextual.  EPA’s refusals to discuss its \ndeclared concerns with Plaintiffs themselves, engage with their \nresponses, or even wait to consider how they would answer its \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 67 of 92\n37 \noversight  questions  give  the  lie  to  its  widely  trumpeted \nconcerns.    Contrived,  baseless  justifications  for  the  grant \nterminations  do  not  satisfy  the  “reasoned  explanation \nrequirement of administrative law,” which “is meant to ensure \nthat  agencies  offer  genuine  justifications  for  important \ndecisions, reasons that can be scrutinized by courts and the \ninterested public.”  Dep’t of Com., 588 U.S. at 785.  The \nSupreme  Court has made clear that “[a]ccepting contrived \nreasons would defeat the purpose of the enterprise.”  Id.  “If \njudicial review is to be more than an empty ritual, it must \ndemand something better” by way of reasoned explanation than \nthe false statements EPA broadcast to build a sensationalist \npublic narrative in its favor.  Id.   \n2. Separation of Powers \nIt  is  equally  clear  that  EPA’s  actions  violate  the \nConstitution.    Our  constitutional  system  of  separation  of \npowers rests on the idea that national “policy is for Congress \nand the President to establish as they see fit in enacting statutes, \nand for the President and subordinate executive agencies . . . to \nimplement within statutory boundaries.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d \nat 257.  “Money is the instrument of policy,” Clinton, 524 U.S. \nat 451 (Kennedy, J., concurring), and it is Congress—not the \nexecutive  branch  acting  unilaterally—that  has  “exclusive \npower over the federal purse,” Rochester Pure Waters Dist. v. \nE.P.A., 960 F.2d 180, 185 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  Only Congress \nmay  authorize  “money  [to]  be  paid  out  of  the  Treasury.”  \nCincinnati  Soap  Co.  v.  United  States,  301  U.S.  308,  321 \n(1937).  And when it does so, the executive “may not ignore” \nthose  funding  directives  “merely  because  of  policy \ndisagreement with Congress.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 260. \nTo hold otherwise would allow “the executive [to] possess \nan unbounded power over the public purse of the nation,” 2 \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 68 of 92\n38 \nJOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE \nUNITED STATES § 1348, at 215 (Thomas Cooley ed., 4th ed. \n1873)—the very concentration of power the Appropriations \nClause was intended to prevent.  See Cincinnati Soap Co., 301 \nU.S.  at  321.    It  is  thus  incontrovertible  that,  “[a]bsent \ncongressional  authorization,  the  Administration  may  not \nredistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to \neffectuate its own policy goals.”  City & Cnty. of San Francisco \nv. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  As then-Judge \nKavanaugh explained, it is a “settled, bedrock principle[] of \nconstitutional  law”  that  neither  the  President  nor  his \n“subordinate executive agencies” may “decline to follow a \nstatutory  mandate  or  prohibition  simply  because  of  policy \nobjections.”  Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259.  Insofar as the \nmajority defends a prerogative of EPA to cancel the grants for \npolicy reasons, the majority’s assertion that “the [Inflation \nReduction] Act does not limit the Administrator’s discretion to \nwithhold or terminate grants,” Maj. Op. 23, squarely conflicts \nwith Aiken.  \nCongress  in  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  appropriated \nfederal funds for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and \ninstructed EPA “to make grants” by September 30, 2024, to \n“nonprofit  organization[s]  that  [are]  designed  to  provide \ncapital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of \nfinancial assistance for the rapid deployment of low- and zero-\nemission products, technologies, and services.”  42 U.S.C. \n§ 7434(a)  (providing  funds  “to  remain  available  until \nSeptember  30,  2024”  and  instructing  EPA  to  make  the \ndescribed  grants),  (c)(1)(A)  (specifying  that  “eligible \nrecipients” must be able to leverage private capital).  The \nstatute specifies that grantees, working in partnership with the \nprivate  sector  and  with  local  communities,  must  provide \nfunding  and  other  assistance  to  housing  and  infrastructure \nprojects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Id. \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 69 of 92\n39 \n§ 7434(b).  EPA is constitutionally obligated to administer \nthose grants; it cannot unilaterally decide to get rid of the grant \nprograms based on the Administration’s policy preference to \n“[t]erminat[e] the Green New Deal.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 8357. \nThe district court found that EPA sought to do just that.  It \nfound that “EPA seeks to dismantle these grant programs in \ntheir entirety as a policy matter,” as shown by EPA’s public \nexpressions of determination to shut down the grant program, \nand as confirmed by its action to terminate “all eight grants \ncomprising the entire NCIF and CCIA programs.”  Climate \nUnited, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 116.  The district court’s factfinding \nis amply supported by the record, and the majority’s conclusion \nthat it was clearly erroneous cannot be squared with EPA’s \nremarkable conduct in this case.  Maj. Op. 25-26.   \nAs already discussed, EPA’s actions at every turn reveal \nits determination to permanently defund the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction  Fund  programs  for  no  more  reason  than  that \nPresident Trump announced that goal.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8357 (directing agencies to “Terminat[e] the Green New Deal” \nby preventing the “disbursement of funds appropriated through \nthe Inflation Reduction Act”).  Without any further planning, \nconsideration, or explanation, EPA acted to prevent Plaintiffs \nfrom accessing their funds.  Current agency leadership has \ndemonized  the  recipients  as  if  the  President’s  policy \npreferences alone license them to slander  as fraudulent or \ncriminal any grantee whose activities do not align with those \npreferences.    No  matter  that  all  evidence  confirms  that \nPlaintiffs were spending their money precisely as Congress \nintended and authorized.   \nIndeed, EPA’s hasty decisions to freeze and terminate the \ngrant  awards  with  no  evidence  of  noncompliance  and  no \ncommunication with Plaintiffs cannot be explained as anything \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 70 of 92\n40 \nother than a decision to do what the President said he wanted \nonly because he said so.  The decision to terminate the grants \njust hours before the district court had a scheduled occasion to \nrule on whether to restore or preserve Plaintiffs’ access to their \naward funds is hard to explain as anything but a bald effort to \nrewrite the statute and undo what was done in compliance with \nit.    Those  are  not  legitimate  means  to  advance  the  new \nPresident’s policy agenda.  Why terminate grant awards that \nhad  been  made  and  were  being  carried  out  as  Congress \nintended unless EPA’s real disagreement was with Congress’s \nlegislated policy choice to fund “green energy” projects? \nThe  majority  chides  the  district  court  for  discounting \nEPA’s representations that it intended to reconstitute the grant \nprograms with increased oversight.  Maj. Op. 25-26.  At oral \nargument,  EPA  disavowed  any  “frontal  assault  on  the \nappropriation  or  Congress’s  objective,”  insisting  that  the \nagency “intends, as consistent with principles of appropriations \nlaw, to continue to make these funds available in a permissible \nway and in a way that comports with the oversight principles \nthat it thinks are important here.”  Oral Arg. Tr. at 25.  But, as \ndiscussed below, since the appropriation’s deadline to obligate \nthe funds has passed, EPA retains at most a narrow authority to \nmake  “replacement”  grants  and  cannot  obligate  the  funds \nanew.   \nIn any event, the district court had ample basis not to credit \nEPA’s representations that it will spend the funds as Congress \nintended.  The court observed EPA’s track record throughout \nthis  case  of  making  slanderous  and  insupportable  public \nstatements and disavowing them in court in favor of self-\nserving contradictory representations.  The court knew that \nEPA instigated unsupported criminal and civil investigations to \nhunt  for  justifications  to  claw  back  Plaintiffs’  money  and \nobserved  that  the  agency  remained  unable  to  provide  any \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 71 of 92\n41 \nevidence  to  support  its  very  public  assertions  of \nmismanagement and insufficient oversight.  Presented with \nEPA’s actions and its patent inability to justify them on any \nother  basis,  the  district  court  was  on  unassailably  solid \nevidentiary footing in finding that EPA’s actions had nothing \nto do with its professed oversight concerns.   EPA simply \nsought to “dismantle these grant programs in their entirety as a \npolicy matter.” Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115.   \nEPA’s “repeated[] represent[ations] that it planned to re-\ncommit the funds,” Maj. Op. 23, ring entirely hollow in light \nof its patent inability to do so.  See Bagenstos Amicus Br. 3-11.  \nIt is an “elementary principle” of federal appropriations law \nthat “a federal agency’s budget authority lapses on the last day \nof the period for which funds were obligated.”  W. Va. Ass’n of \nCmty. Health Ctrs, Inc. v. Heckler, 734 F.2d 1570, 1576 (D.C. \nCir. 1984).  Here, Congress specified that the appropriation for \nthe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund would “remain available \nuntil September 30, 2024.”  42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), (2), (3).  \nThe appropriation thus expired on that date, after which EPA \ncould no longer use the funding to incur new obligations.  See \nOff. of Nat. Res. Revenue-Coop. Agreements, B-321297, 2011 \nWL 3343023, at *3 (Comp. Gen., Aug. 2, 2011).   \nFederal  appropriations  law  thus  bars  EPA  from \nterminating the awards and then re-obligating the funds to \nreconstitute the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund programs.  \n“If an agency deobligates funds after the expiration of the \nperiod of availability, the funds are not available for new \nobligations.”  Continued Availability of Expired Appropriation \nfor Additional Project Phases, B-286929, 2001 WL 717355, at \n*3 (Comp. Gen., Apr. 25, 2001).  In other words, once EPA \nterminates the grant awards, it will no longer have the authority \nto make new grant awards to fulfill its statutory obligations.  \nThe majority suggests that Congress’s repeal last month of the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 72 of 92\n42 \nGreenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could affect EPA’s asserted \nauthority to recommit the funds and thereby relieve it of any \nobligation to do so.  Maj. Op. 25 n. 11.  It does neither.  The \nstatute rescinds only “unobligated” funds: Obligated funds, \nlike those at issue here, are unaffected.  One Big Beautiful Bill \nAct (OBBBA), Pub. L. No. 119-21, § 60002, 139 Stat. 72, 155 \n(2025).  See generally July 7, 2025, Neitzel Ltr. to Clerk of \nCourt  Cislak  (noting  that  Senator  Capito  described  the \nproposition  that  OBBBA  might  “claw  back  money”  as \n“ridiculous”) (quoting Josh Siegel, Q&A: Sen. Shelley Moore \nCapito,  incoming  EPW  chair,  (Nov.  20,  2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/T4KC-8MQ9).  It is the federal appropriations \nrule,  not  the  repeal  legislation,  that  prevents  EPA  from \nrecommitting the funds.   \nEPA’s assertions that it will nonetheless fulfill Congress’s \nplan by labeling its re-obligations as “replacement grants,” \nReply Br. 17, are empty promises.  The majority, too, cites \nreplacement-grant authority as evidence of EPA’s intent to \ncontinue the program with new grantees rather than terminate \nit.  Maj. Op. 24 & n.10.  To qualify as a replacement grant, the \nre-obligation would have to be “substantially identical in scope \nand purpose to the original grant.”  The Honorable Lawton \nChiles U.S. Senate, B-164031, 1976 WL 10353, at *4 (Comp. \nGen. June 25, 1976).  Those requirements cannot be met by \nnew grants that materially alter the financial structure, number \nof grantees, or other oversight controls—meaning that EPA \nwould have to retain the very features it claims prompted the \nagency to interfere with Plaintiffs’ grants.  See NRDC Amicus \nBr. 9-13.   \nThe majority reasons that, because “there is no evidence \nthe  agency  sought  to  dismantle  the  programs  without \ncongressional approval, In re Aiken County cannot support the \ngrantees’ claims.”  Maj. Op. 26.  The majority’s factual premise \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 73 of 92\n43 \nis unsupported, and the validity of Plaintiffs’ separation of \npowers claim follows from Aiken County.  We held in Aiken \nCounty  that  executive  agencies  violate  the  constitutional \nseparation  of  powers  when  they  refuse  to  spend  money \nappropriated  by  Congress  because  they  disagree  with \nCongress’s policy choice.  725 F.3d at 260.  There, as here, \nCongress  appropriated  funds  for  a  particular  effort  (there, \nassessing applications to store nuclear waste; here, making \ncompetitive grants) and set a statutory deadline for the agency \nto act.  Id. at 257-58.  When the agency refused to adhere to the \nstatute due to “policy disagreement[s] with Congress,” we held \nthat  refusal  violated  the  Constitution,  posing  a  threat  to \nundermine “our constitutional system of separation of powers” \nthat supported judicial intervention.  Id. at 260, 267.   \nEPA’s  attempts  to  dismantle  the  statutorily  mandated \nNCIF  and  CCIA  programs  due  to  the  current  agency \nleadership’s policy disagreements with Congress run afoul of \nthe Constitution in the same way.  In rejecting Plaintiffs’ \nseparation  of  powers  claim,  the  majority  says  that  it  is \n“declin[ing] to adopt a principle that would convert every \nstatutory  challenge  to  agency  action  into  a  constitutional \nclaim.”  Maj. Op. 23.  That may well be advisable, but it does \nnot describe the rule of Aiken County that properly applies here.  \nThe majority cannot choose to “decline” to apply our binding \nprecedent.    Wherever  the  line  between  constitutional  and \nstatutory claims lies, Aiken County squarely holds that EPA’s \nactions violated the Constitution. \nB.  Irreparable Injury and Balance of Equities \n  Baseless allegations of fraudulent or criminal activity, \ncoupled with EPA’s unfounded interference with Plaintiffs’ \ngrant funds, threaten enormous harm to Plaintiffs and, more \nimportantly, to the communities, businesses, and individuals \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 74 of 92\n44 \nacross the United States who stand to benefit from the uses of \nthe money that Congress prescribed.  Without access to their \ngrant awards, Plaintiffs are already out of money to make \npayments  for  rent,  third-party  contractors,  and  insurance \npolicies  critical  to  continue  operating,  and  many  of  the \nPlaintiffs  will  permanently  shutter  in  the  coming  months.  \nPlaintiffs have already been forced to defer compensation for, \nlay  off,  withdraw  offers  from,  and  lose  employees  with \nspecialized expertise that “cannot be replaced easily, if at all.”  \nSupp. Bafford Decl. ¶ 7 (J.A. 954).   \nAbsent funding from Plaintiffs, major projects already \nunderway will fold—projects intended to create demand for \nand boost the global competitiveness of U.S. advanced electric \nmanufacturing  capability,  provide  critically  necessary \naffordable  housing  and  infrastructure,  lower  energy  costs, \nimprove air quality, and reduce climate risks across the United \nStates.  If the agency succeeds in taking back the funding \nprovided under the Act, many of those projects will not be able \nto raise capital from other sources and will irrevocably fail.  \nThat is particularly likely because Congress directed grantees \nto invest in “qualified projects that would otherwise lack access \nto  financing.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434(b)(1).    As  just  a  single \nexample, one subgrantee community lender has set up projects \nto  install  clean-energy  microgrids  at  churches,  community \ncenters, and nursing homes in rural Georgia, Mississippi, and \nAlabama to provide sustained power during outages of existing \npower sources.  Without the subgrantee’s promised funds, \nthose projects are at risk of being left undone.  The projects \nwere intended to provide vulnerable populations with “energy \nindependent  safe  havens  for  residents  and  community \nmembers”  during  increasingly  common  extreme  weather \nevents; instead, when blackouts inevitably happen, “[o]xygen \nmachines that would be powered by solar panels during a \nblackout will turn off” and “[e]ssential medications that require \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 75 of 92\n45 \nrefrigeration will warm and spoil.”  Parker Decl. ¶¶ 35-37 (J.A. \n950). \nEPA’s unlawful actions are not just an enormous loss to \nPlaintiffs and the American people.  They defy Congress’s \nobjectives for authorizing and funding the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction Fund: to provide financial assistance to pollution-\nreducing  projects  “in  partnership  with,  and  by  leveraging \ninvestment  from,  the  private  sector.”    42  U.S.C.  § 7434 \n(c)(3)(A).  By directing Citibank to freeze Plaintiffs’ money, \nthe government is making it impossible for Plaintiffs to serve \nas reliable funding partners, ruining their prospects for securing \nfuture partnerships, favorable loan terms, qualified staff, and \nfederal grant funding.  As one Plaintiff explained: \nTo be an effective financing counterparty, CGC (or \nany  organization)  must  have  certainty  of  funding \nsources, be able to move efficiently and reliably in \nnegotiations, and be viewed as credible by involved \nparties.  CGC is made ineffective if potential partners \ncannot  rely  on  when  CGC’s  capital  will  become \navailable.  No credible counterparty will take this \nfunding risk, or be willing to be associated financially \nwith CGC. \nKauffman Decl. ¶ 13 (J.A. 429).  That reputational harm is \ndevastating to Plaintiffs.  Because “part of [Plaintiffs’] purpose \nis to bridge market failures and attract private co-investment to \nprojects that might otherwise be deemed too risky, confidence \nin  [Plaintiffs’]  commitments  as  . . .  investor[s]  is  vital  to \nachieving buy-in from private sector investors. . . .  The longer \nthe freeze on [Plaintiffs’] funds continues, the more difficult it \nwill be for [them] to originate deals and secure co-investors.”  \nId.  ¶¶ 18,  23  (J.A.  430-31).    Worse,  the  agency’s  action \ncontrary to Congress’ enactment sets off a cycle of skepticism.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 76 of 92\n46 \nWhen Plaintiffs’ hard-won partnerships with private investors \nand community lenders initially hesitant to fund clean-energy \nprojects evaporate, those partners will be all the more reluctant \nto invest in similar ventures in the future.  Plaintiffs “have had \nto work hard to build relationships and to earn a reputation as \n[] trustworthy, reliable lending institution[s],” and the “knock-\non effects” of the damage EPA has caused to their reputations \n“will delay adoption and therefore achievement of GGRF’s \nmission.”  Parker Decl. ¶¶ 25-26 (J.A. 947). \nThese harms are the very definition of irreparable injury.  \nOnce a lender’s reputation as a stable source of promised \nfunding is compromised, it is difficult, if not impossible, to \nrepair.  Indeed, investors and loan applicants have already \npulled out of near-final agreements due to the uncertainty over \nwhether Plaintiffs will be able to access their funds.  Projects \nunderway that miss key deadlines due to Plaintiffs’ inability to \nmake good on their loan commitments will be shut down \npermanently.   \nMore broadly, the distrust bred by EPA’s actions will \nmake it exceedingly difficult to revive the coordination and \ncooperation between nonprofit organizations, private investors, \nprivate businesses, and community lenders critical to carrying \nout Congress’s objective of building important projects at low \npublic cost by spending government grant money to leverage \nprivate investment.  What is more, without a court-ordered \ninjunction, the government’s actions portend that EPA will \ndrain the money from Plaintiffs’ accounts with no apparent \navenue for Plaintiffs to reclaim it.  Once EPA successfully \nterminates the awards and moves the funds back to Treasury—\nas it intends to do as soon as the district court’s injunction is \nlifted, see Oral Arg. Tr. 4:14-16—it is unlikely that a court \nwould be able to order their return to Plaintiffs or take any other \naction to fulfill the agency’s congressional mandate.  See City \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 77 of 92\n47 \nof Houston, Tex. v. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 24 F.3d 1421, \n1426 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (explaining that “a court cannot reach” \nfunds that have reverted to Treasury “in order to award relief” \nwhen  the  appropriation  authorizing  their  expenditure  has \nexpired); 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a) (appropriations for GGRF grant \nprograms expired on September 30, 2024); see also generally \nBagenstos Amicus Br. (explaining that EPA cannot re-obligate \nthe grant funds, nor can a court order it to do so, because the \nappropriation authorizing those funds expired in September \n2024).    Under  such  circumstances,  any  eventual  judicial \ndeclaration that the terminations were unlawful would be a \nhollow victory. \nOn the other side of the ledger, the government claims that \nallowing  Plaintiffs  to  access  their  funding  will  cause \n“substantial and irreparable harm to the public fisc.”  Gov. Br. \n41.    But  as  the  government  itself  submits,  its  “bases  for \ntermination  were  the  grants’  structure  and  terms”  which \n“reflected no more than a decision based on reasons of policy,” \nnot  anything  to  do  with  Plaintiffs’  “noncompliance”  or \n“conduct.”  PI Opp. 34-35, 38 (J.A. 503-04, 507) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  The government insists that it is \n“not accusing anybody of fraud.”  Oral Arg. Tr. 27:16.  That is, \nthe government no longer disputes that Plaintiffs are using the \naward funds as initially instructed by EPA, and as mandated by \nCongress.  It is hard to see how the public is harmed by \nPlaintiffs’ use of money allotted by Congress to carry out its \nduly enacted policies. \nC.  Tucker Act \nThe government attempts to divert this court’s attention \nfrom its brazenly unlawful actions by arguing that the district \ncourt lacked jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA claims.  But the \ndistrict court at a minimum had jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 78 of 92\n48 \nmeritorious separation of powers claim.  That alone provides \njurisdiction for the preliminary injunction.   \nIn any event, the majority’s conclusion that the Tucker Act \nbars Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious claim under the APA is \nwrong.  Plaintiffs are not seeking reinstatement of their grant \nawards or any other form of specific performance of contracts.  \nNor are they seeking payment of funds from the Treasury.  \nTheir suit challenges the government’s decision to illegally \nseize their property—money in bank accounts opened in their \nnames, in which the government has only a security interest \n(which it has not exercised).  The grant awards define that \nmoney as “gross income earned by” Plaintiffs, meaning that \ntitle to the money passed to Plaintiffs when the award funds \nwere deposited in their Citibank accounts.  Grant Award at 53 \n(J.A. 1134) (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.1). \nPlaintiffs’ title to the funds in their accounts is cemented \nby the Account Control Agreements between Citibank, EPA, \nand each grantee, which specify that Citibank “maintains the \nAccounts  for  [Plaintiffs],”  and  that  Plaintiffs  are  “the \nentitlement  holder[s]  with  respect  to  all  financial  assets \ncredited  from  time  to  time  to  the  Accounts.”    J.A.  1144.  \nCitibank’s status as a “fiduciary of the government,” Maj. Op. \n14—in which capacity it promises to maintain accounts for \nPlaintiffs,  allow  them  to  “access  and  use  funds”  in  their \naccounts, and provide view access to EPA, Financial Agency \nAgreement Ex. A §§ I.A.1, I.D.1 (J.A. 2145, 2149)—changes \nnothing about Plaintiffs’ title to the money in their accounts.  \nThat Citibank has a contractual obligation to the government to \nserve as a custodian of Plaintiffs’ funds does not mean that the \ngovernment owns the funds. \nIndeed, Plaintiffs’ title to the award funds, which allows \nthe award to serve as a liquid asset instead of an inherently \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 79 of 92\n49 \nrisky  “expected  income  stream,”  is  critical  to  Congress’s \ndecision to equip grantees to attract private investment and is \none of the reasons EPA selected the financial agent structure.  \nImpact Finance Experts Amicus Br. 3, 7-14.  Plaintiffs thus \nseek an equitable remedy “for the recovery of specific property \nor  monies,”  which  stands  in  contradistinction  to  money \ndamages, Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988) \n(internal  quotation  marks  omitted)  (emphasis  added),  the \n“prototypical contract remedy,” Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107. \nThe nature of the relief that Plaintiffs seek—recovery of \nproperty that is lawfully theirs—suffices to resolve the Tucker \nAct question against the government.  Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. \n731 (1947), reflects that longstanding principle.  There, the \nplaintiff sought an injunction preventing the U.S. Maritime \nCommission from selling shares of stock that the plaintiff \nalleged it owned under a contract with the Commission.  Id. at \n734.  The Court held that the district court had jurisdiction over \nthe case even though the plaintiff’s alleged right to the disputed \nproperty originated in a contract and depended on interpreting \nthe contract in its favor.  The Court nonetheless recognized that \nthe plaintiff’s “claim rests on [its] right under general law to \nrecover  possession  of  specific  property  wrongfully \nwithheld”—a claim sounding in tort, not contract.  Id. at 735-\n36.  That was so even though the government possessed and \nhad “record title” to the property.  Id. at 737.  As the Court \nexplained: \n[P]ublic  officials  may  become  tort-feasors  by \nexceeding the limits of their authority.  And where \nthey unlawfully seize or hold a citizen’s realty or \nchattels, recoverable by appropriate action at law or \nin equity, he is not relegated to the Court of Claims \nto recover a money judgment.  The dominant interest \nof the sovereign is then on the side of the victim who \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 80 of 92\n50 \nmay bring his possessory action to reclaim that which \nis wrongfully withheld. \nId. at 738.   \nWe acknowledged in Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis the line \ndrawn in Land v. Dollar between claims to property acquired \nby contract—which may proceed in district court—and claims \nto enforce rights to contractual proceeds, which must proceed \nin the Court of Claims under the Tucker Act:  “The Supreme \nCourt many years ago recognized a private party’s cause of \naction  outside  the  Tucker  Act  to  challenge  the  statutory \nauthority  of  federal  officials  to  claim  ownership  rights  in \nproperty allegedly transferred during the course of a contract.”  \n672 F.2d at 968-69.  That principle confirms the district court’s \njurisdiction here.  Moreover, these cases underscore that a \nclaim  to  recover  property  need  not  be  framed  as  an \nunconstitutional taking to proceed in district court.   \nPlaintiffs claim that EPA has unlawfully interfered with \ntheir previously disbursed funds in violation of, inter alia, the \nAPA.  Appellee Br. at 15.  Plaintiffs assert that EPA has \n“unlawfully  seize[d]”  their  property,  and  they  seek  an \ninjunction to “reclaim that which is wrongfully withheld.”  \nDollar, 330 U.S. at 738.  This case is even clearer in that regard \nthan Land v. Dollar itself, because the government has neither \ntitle to nor possession of the disputed funds.  Plaintiffs’ action \nis one to recover their property.  It does not seek any money \nfrom  the  Treasury.    It  is  not  a  contract  action  so  is  not \n“relegated to the Court of Claims.”  Id.  As in Megapulse, \nPlaintiff’s  “position  is  ultimately  based,  not  on  breach  of \ncontract,  but  on  an  alleged  governmental  infringement  of \nproperty rights and violation of [a statute].” 672 F.2d at 969.  \n  The  Supreme  Court  itself  recently  recognized  that \ndistinction in Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 81 of 92\n51 \nCoalition,  where  it  declined  to  stay  a  district  court  order \nrequiring the government to issue payments owed to plaintiffs \nfor foreign aid work they had already completed.  145 S. Ct. \n753 (2025).  The government argued there, as here, that the \nplaintiffs essentially sought to enforce a government contract \nso must proceed, if at all, in the Court of Claims.  See id. at 756 \n(Alito, J., joined by Thomas, Gorsuch, and Kavanaugh, JJ., \ndissenting from the denial of the application to vacate the \ndistrict court’s order).  The Court was unpersuaded that the \ngovernment thus was likely to establish a sovereign immunity \nbar against the district court’s jurisdiction.  Id. at 753.  Like the \ngrantees  here,  the  plaintiffs  in  AIDS  Vaccine  Advocacy \nCoalition  brought  APA  and  constitutional  challenges  to \ndefendants’ interference with their existing entitlement to grant \nfunding.    Their  claims  depended  not  on  breach  of  their \ncontracts,  but  on  the  unlawfulness  of  the  government’s \nactions.  The district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ APA \nand constitutional claims here is even clearer than it was in \nAIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, because here, unlike there, \npayment was already made. \n \nThose  same  facts—that  Plaintiffs  seek  an  injunction \npreventing the government from interfering with money the \ngovernment has already properly disbursed to them—renders \ninapplicable the Supreme Court’s emergency stay orders in \nNational Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Ass’n, \nNo.  25-A-103,  2025  WL  2415669  (Aug.  21,  2025),  and \nDepartment of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025).  \nI respect the reasoning of those orders where they apply, but no \npart of the district court’s injunction in this case “order[s] the \npayment  of  money”  from  the  Treasury  or  requires  the \ngovernment  to  “pay  out  past-due  grant  obligations”  or  to \n“continue paying obligations as they accrue.”  Dep’t of Ed., 145 \nS. Ct. at 968.  And, unlike plaintiffs in National Institutes of \nHealth,  Plaintiffs  here  need  not  seek  to  enforce  the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 82 of 92\n52 \ngovernment’s “obligation to pay money,” 2025 WL 2415669, \nat *1, because these Plaintiffs’ money was already paid before \nDefendants interfered with it.     \nRather, what Plaintiffs seek here is to unfreeze their funds \nand to enjoin EPA from unlawfully interfering with them based \non  the  President’s  announced  policy  disagreement  with \nCongress’s objectives.  In doing so, Plaintiffs challenge EPA’s \ndecision to replace Congress’s legislated policy choice with \none aligning with the President’s directions.  See Executive \nOrder 14154 (ordering agencies to “Terminat[e] the Green \nNew Deal” by stopping the “disbursement of funds”); J.A. 507 \n(Defendants opposition to motion for preliminary injunction \ndescribing contract terminations as “reflect[ing] no more than \na decision based on reasons of policy”) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); Climate United, 778 F. Supp. 3d at 115-16 \n(finding that EPA “seeks to dismantle these grant programs in \ntheir entirety as a policy matter”).  To the extent National \nInstitutes of Health applies here, it supports the district court’s \njurisdiction over the policy-based interference with Plaintiffs’ \nfunds.  See National Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2415669, at \n*2 (Barrett, J., concurring) (asserting that a district court likely \nhas jurisdiction over challenges to an agency’s policies).         \nBinding precedent of this court anchors the district court’s \njurisdiction.  Our “longstanding test for determining whether a \nclaim falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Claims Court \npursuant to the Tucker Act” confirms that the Tucker Act does \nnot displace the district court’s jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \narbitrary and capricious claim.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106.  We \nexplained in Megapulse that, in order to preserve the Court of \nClaims’  exclusive  jurisdiction  over  “actions  based  on \ngovernment contracts,” a plaintiff whose “claims against the \nUnited States are essentially contractual” cannot be allowed to \n“avoid the jurisdictional (and hence remedial) restrictions of \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 83 of 92\n53 \nthe Tucker Act by casting its pleadings in terms that would \nenable a district court to exercise jurisdiction under a separate \nstatute.”  672 F.2d at 967.  Whether a “particular action” is “‘at \nits essence’ a contract action depends both on [1] the source of \nthe rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon \n[2] the type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Id. at 968.  That \nis  a  flexible,  context-specific  inquiry  that  directs  us  to \n“determine if the claim so clearly presents a disguised contract \naction that jurisdiction over the matter is properly limited to the \nCourt of Claims.”  Id. \nStarting with the first prong, to determine whether the \n“source of the rights” of a claim is contractual, we consider \nwhether the plaintiff’s arguments turn on the terms of the \ncontract.  In Perry Capital LLC v. Mnuchin, for instance, we \nconcluded that the plaintiff’s claims were not “a disguised \ncontract action” because the plaintiff did not “seek to enforce \nany duty imposed upon [the government] by the [relevant \ncontract],” nor did it “contend [the government] breached the \nterms” of the contract or “invoke” the contract in any other \nmeaningful way.  864 F.3d 591, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Similarly, in Megapulse, we were \n“convinced” that the plaintiff’s claims were not “disguised” \ncontract claims by the fact that the plaintiff did not “claim a \nbreach of contract” and based its “request for relief” on non-\ncontractual documents.  672 F.2d at 969. \nPlaintiffs’ APA challenge to Defendants’ arbitrary and \ncapricious action is clearly not a “disguised contract action.”  \nTheir claim is not premised on EPA’s violation of the grant \nagreements’  termination  provisions,  nor  on  its  failure  to \nperform any duty “imposed” on EPA by the grant award.  \nRather, Plaintiffs assert that they are entitled to relief because \nEPA froze and seeks to seize their funds based on pretextual, \ninternally  inconsistent,  and  unfounded  reasons.    See,  e.g., \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 84 of 92\n54 \nPlaintiffs’ Mot. for Preliminary Injunction (PI Mot.) 29 (J.A. \n327) (arguing that “the record leading up to the termination”—\nfor example, the fact that EPA purported to terminate the grants \nseveral days after professing a “lack of critical information” \nabout  “concerns  regarding  potential  fraud”  that  would  be \ninformed by an ongoing compliance review—“highlights the \npretextual nature of EPA’s stated invocation of waste, fraud, \nand abuse”).  According to Plaintiffs, and as supported by the \nrecord, EPA acted entirely outside the bounds of acceptable \nagency action by first deciding to seize the money Plaintiffs \nhad been awarded and then casting about for after-the-fact \njustifications—including  pressuring  Citibank  into  freezing \nPlaintiffs’ funds without any basis, notice, or explanation, and \ndirecting DOJ and FBI to open criminal investigations into \nPlaintiffs’ grant performance without probable cause, or any \ngrounds whatsoever.  See PI Mot. 1-4 (J.A. 299-302).  \nThat is precisely the type of arbitrary and capricious action \nthe  APA  is  designed  to  address.    As  the  Supreme  Court \nexplained in Department of Commerce v. New York, agency \naction is arbitrary and capricious when the agency’s “stated \nrationale was  pretextual,”  because  “contrived  reasons  . . . \ndefeat the purpose of” the “reasoned explanation requirement \nof administrative law.”  588 U.S. at 773-74, 785.  The non-\ncontractual “essence” of Plaintiffs’ APA claim has been clear \nsince Plaintiffs filed their complaint and sought a preliminary \ninjunction.  They have from the outset sought to show that \nEPA’s  vague,  unsupported,  and  irrational  justifications  are \nmerely “pretextual cover to shut down a program approved by \nCongress that the new Administration does not like.”  PI Mot. \n29 (J.A. 327).  That was clear to the district court from the very \nfirst hearing.  See Mar. 12 TRO Hr’g Tr. 9:17-18 (J.A. 182) \n(district court observing that the terminations have “a ready, \nfire, aim” feel).  Plaintiffs seek relief based on a quintessential \nclaim of arbitrary and capricious agency action.  The APA, and \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 85 of 92\n55 \nnot the contractual terms of the grants EPA awarded them, is \nthe “source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its \nclaims.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. \nAs for the second prong of the Megapulse analysis—the \n“type of relief sought”—we have described the “crux of this \ninquiry” as “boil[ing] down to whether the plaintiff effectively \nseeks  to  attain  .  .  .  monetary  relief  from  the  federal \ngovernment.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107.  As explained above, \nPlaintiffs do not seek money from the Treasury; they seek only \nto get the government’s hands off their money.  To the extent \nthe injunction preventing the government from interfering with \nor  seizing  their  funds  “require[s]  the  same  governmental \nrestraint that specific []performance might require in a contract \nsetting,” that is an “insufficient basis to deny a district court the \njurisdiction  otherwise  available  and  the  remedial  powers \notherwise appropriate.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 971. \nBoth prongs of the Megapulse analysis thus point to the \nsame conclusion:  Plaintiffs’ claim of arbitrary and capricious \nagency action is not a “disguised” contract action that must be \nheard by the Court of Claims.  That conclusion comports with \nour  longstanding  recognition  that  the  Tucker  Act  was  a \nresponse to “congressional intent to provide a single, uniquely \nqualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes.”  \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78.  The “unique expertise of the \nCourt of Claims” lies in its “knowledge of the government \ncontracting  process,”  id.;  it  is  a  “specialized  forum”  for \nawarding “damages for the Government’s past acts,” Bowen, \n487 U.S. at 905 n.42, 908 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIt is far outside the specialized expertise of the Court of \nClaims to resolve these Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief \nhalting EPA’s naked pursuit of its preferred policy outcome in \ndisregard for the evidence before it and its statutory mandate.  \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 86 of 92\n56 \nPlaintiffs’ claim that EPA violated the APA’s ban on arbitrary \nand capricious agency action—a claim for which they seek \ninjunctive  relief,  not  payment  from  the  Treasury—is  well \nwithin the district court’s remit.   \nThat Plaintiffs would have no right to the money to begin \nwith but for the grant awards, which are government contracts, \ndoes not alter that conclusion.  We have squarely held that the \nfact that a plaintiff “would have no claims to assert” absent a \ngovernment contract does not mean that the plaintiff asserts a \n“contract right.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (explaining that \nimposing such a “‘but-for’ test for identifying the source of the \nright . . . contravenes Megapulse’s express rejection of the \nargument  that  the  mere  existence  of  such  contract-related \nissues  converts  the  action  to  one  based  on  the  contract”) \n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Transohio Sav. \nBank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 610 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1992)  (“[L]itigants  may  bring  statutory  and \nconstitutional claims in federal district court even when the \nclaims depend on the existence and terms of a contract with the \ngovernment.”), abrogated on other grounds as recognized in \nPerry Capital, 864 F.3d at 620. \nAt bottom, the government suggests that Plaintiffs’ real \ncomplaint is that EPA terminated their grant awards—not that \nit acted arbitrarily and capriciously in doing so—making its \nclaim “in essence” a contract claim.  It is obviously true that \nPlaintiffs are injured by the terminations.  But it does not follow \nthat Plaintiffs therefore assert contractual claims.  When EPA \nbegan  its  campaign  to  undo  the  GGRF,  it  had  already \nperformed on the contracts by disbursing the funds, which by \nthen belonged to Plaintiffs.  The fact that those funds may only \nbe  used  in  accordance  with  grant  terms  does  not  mean \nPlaintiffs’ only legal right to protect them arises from contract. \nAs explained above, Plaintiffs’ theory of relief is that EPA \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 87 of 92\n57 \ncarried out the funding freeze and purported terminations to \nreplace  Congress’s  policy  choice  with  its  own  preferred \napproach,  without  regard  for  whether  its  actions  were \nsupported by evidence or reason.  That is a classic claim of \narbitrary and capricious agency action in violation of the APA.  \nThat is what makes the APA, and not their grant awards, the \n“source of the rights upon which the plaintiff[s] base[] [their] \nclaims.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. \nBecause Plaintiffs bring legitimate APA and constitutional \nclaims over which the district court has jurisdiction, I would \nnot reach their ultra vires theory.  But to the extent the majority \nconcludes  that  Plaintiffs’  ultra  vires  claim  fails  because \nPlaintiffs “essentially” allege only a breach of contract, the \nmajority errs.  Maj. Op. 21-22.  For all the reasons discussed \nabove, Plaintiffs’ claims are not “essentially” contractual. \nCiting Ingersoll-Rand, the majority posits that Plaintiffs’ \nallegations of pretextual agency  action are  contract claims \nbecause “that challenge turns, in substance, on principles of \nfederal  contract  law”—that  is,  Plaintiffs’  pretext  argument \ncould be rephrased as a claim that EPA “dishonor[ed], with \nimpunity,  its  contractual  obligations.”    Maj.  Op.  17.    But \nPlaintiffs’  APA  claim  is  not  “essentially”  contractual  just \nbecause EPA’s arbitrary and capricious action included grant \nterminations.  The majority appears to read Ingersoll-Rand as \nestablishing  a  rule  that  any  claim  that  could  be \nreconceptualized as a contractual violation that overlaps even \nin part with the claim Plaintiffs actually bring is necessarily a \ndisguised contract claim.  See Maj. Op. 16.  Ingersoll-Rand \nannounces no such rule, and any effort to interpret it to do \nsquarely conflicts with our binding precedent.  \nIn Ingersoll-Rand, the government terminated its contract \nwith the plaintiff “for convenience,” as allowed under the terms \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 88 of 92\n58 \nof the contract.  Id. at 75.  The plaintiff sued, alleging that the \ntermination  violated  several  regulations  constraining  the \ngovernment’s  ability  to  cancel  and  administer  federal \nacquisition  contracts,  and  that  those  regulatory  violations \nmeant that the termination was arbitrary and capricious.  Id. at \n77.  We held that the “essential rights at stake” were contractual \nbecause the regulations themselves—the violation of which \nwas  allegedly  arbitrary  and  capricious—concerned  the \nconditions under which the government could terminate the \ncontract.  Id. at 77-78.  In effect, the plaintiff had relied on \nregulations circumscribing the government’s behavior during \nthe solicitation and performance of contracts to challenge the \nvalidity  of  the  contract’s  termination-for-convenience \nprovision.  The plaintiff’s claim thus “call[ed] for knowledge \nof the government contracting process” and fell “within the \nunique expertise of the Court of Claims.”  Id. at 78.  In that \ncontext,  in  which  the  plaintiff’s  claim  centered  on  the \nintricacies of the government’s contracting process and the \ninteraction between contracting regulations and the terms of the \nplaintiff’s contract, it made sense to hold that the plaintiff’s \nability to “challenge the termination based solely on contract \nprinciples”  supported  our  determination  that  its  claim \n“sound[ed]  genuinely  in  contract.”    Id.  (internal  quotation \nmarks omitted).   \nIngersoll-Rand thus establishes that claims that invoke \nregulations  governing  federal  contracting  to  challenge \ngovernment action taken pursuant to a contract are “in essence” \ncontractual and belong in the Court of Claims, where that \ncourt’s  expertise  in  government  contracting  is  particularly \nrelevant.  And it supports the majority’s conclusion that claims \nbased  on  violations  of  regulations  governing  termination \nprocedures are “in essence” contract claims, which is likely \ncorrect.  See Maj. Op. 11-13.  But that does not describe \nPlaintiffs’  arbitrary  and  capricious  claim.    Ingersoll-Rand \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 89 of 92\n59 \ndecidedly does not stand for a general rule that any claim that \ncould have been framed as a breach of “principles of federal \ncontract law” must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims” \nMaj. Op. 17—a rule that could not be squared with our other \nrelevant decisions.   \nThat is illustrated most clearly by Sharp v. Weinberger, \n798 F.2d 1521 (D.C. Cir. 1986), a decision authored by then-\nJudge Scalia and decided the year after Ingersoll-Rand.  The \nplaintiff in Sharp challenged a Department of Defense policy \nremoving  him  from  the  Ready  Reserve  where  he  served \npursuant to a contract—the Ready Reserve Service Agreement.  \n798 F.2d at 1521-23.  The plaintiff alleged that the policy \nbreached his contract and violated a  statute governing the \nReady  Reserve,  and  that  the  contract  gave  him  a  “vested \nproperty interest” in serving in the reserves that the government \n“sought to deny without due process.”  Id. at 1523.  The \nplaintiff’s requested relief included a declaration that the policy \nwas “contrary to statute or in the alternative that it effects a \nmaterial breach of the Ready Reserve Service Agreement,” as \nwell as a declaration that the government’s “failure to honor \nthe  terms  of  that  contract  deprived  [the  plaintiff]  of  due \nprocess.”  Id.  We held that, while the Tucker Act barred the \ndistrict  court’s  jurisdiction  over  the  plaintiff’s  breach  of \ncontract  claim,  it  did  not  displace  the  district  court’s \njurisdiction  over  the  plaintiff’s  claims  that  the  policy  was \n“contrary to regulations, statutes and the Constitution.”  Id.; \naccord Transohio, 967 F.2d at 610.  That is, the plaintiff’s \nstatutory, regulatory, and constitutional claims that he had been \nunlawfully deprived of his contractual right to serve in the \nReady Reserve were not “in essence” contractual even though \nhis right to serve in the first place depended on contract, and he \nexpressly brought one claim as a pure breach of contract.   \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 90 of 92\n60 \nThe  majority’s  view  of  Ingersoll-Rand  cannot  be \nreconciled with Sharp.  Allen Sharp’s statutory, regulatory, and \nconstitutional  claims  not  only  could  be  based  on  contract \nprinciples,  but  in  fact were  also  framed  that  way.    If  the \nmajority’s rule were right, the district court could not have \nexercised jurisdiction over his due process claim.  The same \nanalysis is confirmed in Megapulse itself.  There, the plaintiff \nalleged  that  the  government’s  plan  to  distribute  his  data \nviolated the Trade Secrets Act and deprived him of his property \nwithout due process.  672 F.2d at 962-63.  That claim, too, \ncould have been based solely on contract principles, as the \ngovernment had made a contractual promise not to disseminate \nthe plaintiff’s “limited rights” data.  Id. at 962.  But that \ncounterfactual did not preclude us from holding—nor even \nfactor  into  our  conclusion—that  the  district  court  had \njurisdiction over the plaintiff’s claim.  See id. at 966-71.   \nIndeed, in Megapulse, we expressly rejected the idea that \nthe Tucker Act means that “an agency action may not be \nenjoined, even if in clear violation of a specific statute, simply \nbecause that same action might also amount to a breach of \ncontract.”  Id. at 971.  Rather, district courts have jurisdiction \nover and can enjoin agency action that violates the APA, even \nif that action also “amounts to” a breach of contract.  Id.  That \nis the situation here: Plaintiffs claim that EPA’s termination \nwas arbitrary and capricious because it relied on pretextual and \nunsupported justifications, not because it violated the grant \naward’s termination provision.  The fact that the government’s \narbitrary and capricious decision making could be reframed as \na claim that “EPA acted with ‘impunity’ when terminating the \ngrants” does not transform the claim into a contract action. \nIn  relegating  to  the  Court  of  Claims  any  statutory, \nregulatory, or constitutional claim merely because it arguably \ncould to some extent be reframed as a contract action, the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 91 of 92\n61 \nmajority’s  rule  precludes  district  court  jurisdiction  and \ninjunctive  relief  for  a  wide  swath  of  claims  that—like \nPlaintiffs’ claim that EPA’s actions to freeze their accounts and \nterminate  their  grants  were  arbitrary  and  capricious—are \nsimply  not  contract  claims.    Such  a  rule  effects  an \nunprecedented expansion of the Tucker Act that is divorced \nfrom the “congressional intent to provide a single, uniquely \nqualified forum for the resolution of contractual disputes,” \nIngersoll-Rand, 780 F.2d at 78, and it strips district courts of \njurisdiction over all manner of claims over which they have the \nrelevant expertise.  It also threatens to “preclude any review at \nall of constitutional claims seeking equitable relief, where the \nconstitutional  claims  stem  from  contracts,”  thereby  raising \n“serious constitutional question[s].”  Transohio, 967 F.2d at \n611 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it flies in the face \nof our cases’ longstanding refrain that “the mere fact that a \ncourt  may  have  to  rule  on  a  contract  issue  does  not,  by \ntriggering  some  mystical  metamorphosis,  automatically \ntransform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the \ncourt of jurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Crowley, 38 \nF.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).  Such a \nrule is unsupported by our precedent, prevents the court from \nmaking  “rational  distinctions  between  actions  sounding \ngenuinely in contract and those based on truly independent \nlegal  grounds,”  and  runs  directly  counter  to  our \nacknowledgement that, “[a]lthough it is important on the one \nhand to preserve the Tucker Act’s limited and conditioned \nwaiver of sovereign immunity in contract actions, we must not \ndo so in terms so broad as to deny a [district] court jurisdiction \nto consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than \na contractual relationship with the government.”  Megapulse, \n672 F.2d at 968-70.   \nAs applied in this case, the majority’s conclusion that \nPlaintiffs’ claims are merely contract claims ignores what the \n \n\nUSCA Case #25-5123      Document #2132901            Filed: 09/02/2025      Page 92 of 92\n62 \nagency did and describes a claim that Plaintiffs did not bring.  \nThis case is not an attempt to reframe EPA’s termination or \nviolation of some grant awards as unlawful agency action.  \nIndeed, throughout this litigation, there has hardly been any \ndispute that the government did breach the terms of the grant \nawards.  That is not what this case is about.  Plaintiffs challenge \nEPA’s asserted power to take baseless and unjustifiable actions \nto pursue its desired ends—here, the termination of the grant \nawards—regardless of the means it must employ to get there.  \nIt is beyond dispute that questions of such significance to the \nway our government operates are not relegated to the exclusive \njurisdiction of the Court of Claims. \nCONCLUSION \nEmbracing  a  misguided  and  breathtakingly  expansive \nconception  of  the  Tucker  Act,  the  majority  allows  the \ngovernment to seize Plaintiffs’ money based on spurious and \npretextual allegations and to permanently gut implementation \nof major congressional legislation designed to improve the \ninfrastructure, health, and economic security of communities \nthroughout the country.  The injunction the district court put in \nplace  is  eminently  supported  by  Plaintiffs’  likelihood  of \nsuccess  on  both  their  APA  and  constitutional  claims,  the \nirreparable  harm  that  will  befall  them,  and  the  unlawful \nnullification of Congress’s duly enacted policy—all of which \ninure to the detriment of the American people.  I respectfully \ndissent. \n ",
