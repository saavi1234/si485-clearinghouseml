    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the federal government&rsquo;s alleged sudden shift in immigration policy, threatening to subject thousands of legally paroled immigrants, including families fleeing violence and persecution, to fast-track deportation without basic due process.</p>\r\n<p>On March 24, 2025, three immigrant advocacy organizations, the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), UndocuBlack Network, and CASA, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs named President Donald Trump, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the agency heads of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) as defendants. Plaintiffs challenged various policies under the Trump administration of expanding expedited removal of hundreds of thousands of immigrants who entered the country legally through humanitarian parole processes. Represented by nonprofit counsel, Plaintiffs alleged that these policies violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and the Fifth Amendment guarantee to due process. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the administration from unlawfully applying expedited removal procedures to individuals who had previously been granted lawful entry into the United States under humanitarian parole programs. This case was assigned to District Judge Jia M. Cobb.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiffs argued that the government&rsquo;s actions violated statutory limits on expedited removal by targeting noncitizens who had been lawfully paroled into the United States&mdash;individuals whom the INA expressly excludes from expedited removal. Plaintiffs also claimed the policy was arbitrary and capricious under the APA and deprived their members of constitutional due process protections. Plaintiffs requested a preliminary and permanent injunction against the enforcement of the new policies, as well as vacatur of agency memoranda and orders, and attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>The events giving rise to the lawsuit began shortly after President Trump returned to office in January 2025. On January 20, he issued Executive Order 14165, &ldquo;Securing Our Borders,&rdquo; directing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to terminate categorical humanitarian parole programs, such as those for nationals of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (CHNV) and for Afghan and Ukrainian evacuees. In the days following the order, Acting DHS Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman issued several internal memoranda to ICE, USCIS, and U.S. Customs &amp; Border Patrol implementing a drastic reinterpretation of the INA&rsquo;s parole authority and expanding the scope of expedited removal. On January 21, Huffman issued a Federal Register notice (90 Fed. Reg. 8139) that expanded expedited removal nationwide to noncitizens unable to prove two years of continuous presence. On January 23, Huffman instructed personnel to consider using expedited removal against any eligible noncitizen, even those already paroled and residing in the U.S. On February 18, ICE issued a further directive, leaked to the press, stating that there was &ldquo;no time limit&rdquo; on applying expedited removal to &ldquo;paroled arriving aliens,&rdquo; a stance in direct contradiction with previous federal guidance limiting expedited removal to recent entrants without lawful status.</p>\r\n<p>On March 21, DHS posted a notice for publication in the Federal Register that officially terminated the CHNV parole processes and declared that all CHNV parolees would lose their status en masse after 30 days. The notice acknowledged that many parolees would no longer be eligible for expedited removal after reaching two years of continuous presence, and thus justified the early termination as a means to enable their rapid deportation. This notice conflicted with the earlier February directive, sowing confusion about the applicable rules and timelines. Plaintiffs&rsquo; complaint emphasized the harm to their members, many of whom had entered through legal pathways like CBP One or were sponsored under parole programs and had applied for work permits, Temporary Protected Status (\"TPS\"), or asylum. The organizations detailed several members&rsquo; stories, including an Afghan man fearing execution if returned, a Haitian mother trying to care for her sick son, and families from Venezuela and Guatemala escaping political violence and persecution. All faced an imminent risk of sudden removal without a hearing.</p>\r\n<p>The lawsuit asserted three main legal claims: (1) the unlawful application of expedited removal to paroled individuals under the INA; (2) violations of the APA for arbitrary and inconsistent agency action; and (3) deprivation of constitutional due process under the Fifth Amendment. Plaintiffs requested that the court declare the challenged policies unlawful, vacate them, enjoin their enforcement, and award attorneys&rsquo; fees.</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, 2025, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss. On June 11, Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting two additional claims: (1) violation of the APA under the <em>Accardi</em> doctrine and (2) violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act; APA 5 U.S.C. &sect;706(2); and 8 U.S.C. &sect;1252(e)(3). That same day, Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay the effective dates of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Parole Termination Notice, to the extent they subject paroled individuals to expedited removal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 12, the court denied the government's motion to dismiss as moot in light of Plaintiffs' amended complaint, and on June 17, the court set a briefing schedule on the pending motion to stay the effective dates.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 1, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion to enjoin agency action, barring the enforcement of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive, and the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice to the extent that these actions subject paroled individuals to expedited removal. The Court held that neither jurisdictional nor other procedural bars preclude the requested relief, and further found that the challenged actions exceed the statutory authority of DHS and are arbitrary and capricious. The government immediately appealed this order to the DC Circuit Court.</p>\r\n<p>On August 4, the government moved to stay the August 1 injunction pending appeal. The government argued that barring the enforcement of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive, and the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice will halt their ability to expeditiously remove aliens who have no basis to remain in the country.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The August 4 motion was denied. The court said that the motion largely reiterated the basis presented in the response to the plaintiff's motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On August 14, the Government filed an emergency motion to stay the underlying August 1 injunction pending appeal. The court ordered an administrative stay. However, this administrative stay does not apply insofar as the district court&rsquo;s order prohibits the government from applying expedited removal to former parolees who have been continuously present in the United States for longer than two years. The emergency stay was then dissolved, as the motion to stay was denied in total on September 12.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

At bottom, \nPlaintiffs seek to “enjoin Defendants from applying expedited removal to noncitizens who have \npreviously been granted parole at a port of entry.”  Compl., Prayer for Relief, at ¶ 4.  But their \ncomplaint suffers from several threshold deficiencies that preclude their request for such vastly \noverbroad relief. \nTo start, Plaintiffs, immigrant rights organizations, fail to plead cognizable injury, either to \nthemselves or their members.  Indeed, they cannot point to even one member who has been \nthreatened with expedited removal, and their theory of injury is based on a series of conjectures \nabout possible future harm that is insufficient.  The Court should therefore dismiss the case for \nlack of Article III standing.  \nThis Court further lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to review Plaintiffs’ challenges to \nexpedited removal because the expedited removal statute requires these claims to be raised within \nsixty days of when the statute and its implementing regulations went into effect (i.e., within sixty \ndays of April 1, 1997). 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B).  That limitation is jurisdictional. Because \nPlaintiffs’ suit is untimely multiple times over under this jurisdictional limitation, their complaint \nmust be dismissed.   \nMoreover, two additional provisions in 8 U.S.C. § 1252 preclude the Court from granting \nPlaintiffs’ request for injunctive relief.  First, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g), by its very terms, deprives the \nCourt of jurisdiction to enjoin Defendants from “commenc[ing]” expedited removal proceedings.  \nSee Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 487 (1999).  And 8 \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 12 of 55\n     \n \nU.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) precludes the Court from “enjoin[ing] or restrain[ing] the operation” of the \nexpedited removal statute,  other than  with  respect to  “an individual alien  against  whom \nproceedings [] have been initiated.”  (Emphasis added).  Plaintiffs include no such “individual \nalien[s].”    Thus,  Plaintiffs’  request that  the  Court  issue  broad injunctive relief  to  every \n“noncitizen[] who ha[s] previously been granted parole at a port of entry” runs headlong into \nsection 1252(f)(1)’s prohibition.   \nAlternatively, the complaint should be dismissed because Plaintiffs fail to state a viable \nclaim.   Plaintiffs’ claims are rooted in an erroneous interpretation of  the Immigration and \nNationality Act (“INA”) under which the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) cannot \ninvoke expedited removal for an alien paroled at a port of entry.  But the governing statute clearly \nauthorizes  expedited  removal  of  aliens  “arriving  in  the  United  States,”  see  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), which includes aliens who arrive and are processed at a port of entry.  8 C.F.R. \n§ 1.2.  The fact that such aliens are granted parole into the United States does not preclude \napplication of expedited removal.  Id.  Instead, “[a]n arriving alien remains such even if paroled \npursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act.”  Id.  Indeed, Congress has clearly provided that when \nthe purposes of parole have been served the alien “shall forthwith” be returned to custody “and \nthereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant \nfor admission to the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  \nIn addition, and apart from the arriving alien provision, aliens paroled at a port of entry \n(whose parole is later terminated or revoked) can be subject to expedited removal if they have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than two years as designated by the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, as they now are.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii); 90 Fed. Reg. 8139 (Jan. 24, \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 13 of 55\n     \n \n2025).  The central and indispensable premise of Plaintiffs’ claims is thus untenable.  Dismissal is \nrequired. \nLEGAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \nI.

In 1996, Congress created expedited removal, a  removal \nprocedure that  allows  the  Government to  deport from  the  United  States  quickly  certain \ninadmissible aliens who have no supporting documentation or who present fraudulent documents.  \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1).  An alien subject to expedited removal can claim a fear of persecution or \ntorture or express an intention to apply for asylum, after which he will receive a credible fear \nscreening; if found to have a credible fear, he may apply for asylum, withholding of removal, and \nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B); 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(e), \n(f), (g), 235.3(b)(4).  If not, they can be then removed.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii).  The \nconstitutionality and legality of the expedited removal statute has generally been upheld by courts.1  \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. 103, 140-41 (2020) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(2), which limited judicial review of § 1225(b)(1) expedited removal proceedings to \nhabeas corpus proceedings and limited the habeas review, did not violate the Suspension Clause); \nAm. Immigr. Lawyers Ass’n v. Reno (“AILA”), 18 F. Supp. 2d 38, 47 (D.D.C. 1998), aff’d, 199 \nF.3d 1352 (D.C. Cir. 2000).   \n \n1  See also United States v. Guzman, 998 F.3d 562, 571-72 (4th Cir. 2021) (rejecting challenge \nasserting right to counsel in expedited removal proceedings); United States v. Sanchez-Aguilar, \n719 F.3d 1108, 1112 (9th Cir. 2013) (“The statute and regulation governing expedited removal \nproceedings, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) and 8 C.F.R. § 235.3, set forth the procedural rights to which \nsuch aliens are entitled, but the right to be informed of potentially available avenues of relief from \nremoval is not among them.”). \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 14 of 55\n     \n \n  Two groups of aliens are subject to expedited removal:  (1) aliens arriving in the United \nStates, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) (“an alien . . . who is arriving in the United States”), and (2) \naliens designated by the Secretary of Homeland Security within certain outer statutory limits, id. \n(“an alien . . . described in clause (iii)”).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), (iii);  8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(1).  The statute limits designation to that second group of aliens as follows:  “An alien  \n. . . who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has not affirmatively \nshown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien has been physically present in \nthe United States  continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of  the \ndetermination of inadmissibility under this subparagraph.”2  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  \nAliens in either the first group (arriving alien) or second group (designated alien) can be removed \nthrough the expedited removal procedure if they are removable on either of two grounds of \ninadmissibility, namely, on the basis of fraud, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or a lack of documents, 8 \nU.S.C § 1182(a)(7).  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).   \n  In 1997, DOJ promulgated implementing regulations to apply expedited removal initially \nonly to aliens arriving at a port of entry.  Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention \nand Removal of Aliens; Conduct of Removal Proceedings; Asylum Procedures, 62 Fed. Reg. \n10,312, 10,312-13 (Mar. 6, 1997) (noting the agency’s view “that the statute seemed to differentiate \nmore clearly between aliens at ports-of-entry and those encountered elsewhere in the United \nStates”).  The Department adopted a regulation defining arriving alien to include “an alien who \n \n2  The statute explicitly excludes an alien “described in subparagraph (F),” i.e., one “who is a \nnative or citizen of a country in the Western Hemisphere with whose government the United States \ndoes not have full diplomatic relations and who arrives by aircraft at a port of entry.”  8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), (F).   \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 15 of 55\n     \n \nseeks admission to or transit through the United States, as provided in 8 CFR part 235, at a port-\nof-entry.”  8 C.F.R. § 1.1(q) (1998) (currently at 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2, 1001.1(q)).  Critically, for \npurposes of this suit, it also provided:  “An arriving alien remains such even if paroled pursuant to \nsection 212(d)(5) of the Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)].”  Id.  That rule was effective on April 1, 1997.  \n62 Fed. Reg. at 10,312.   \nAlthough the regulation has been revised since its adoption, the amendments only confirm \nthat “arriving alien” includes aliens paroled at a port of entry like the members described by \nPlaintiffs.  In 1998 the legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued a rulemaking \namending the “arriving alien” definition by exempting aliens paroled before April 1, 1997.  See \nAmendment of the Regulatory Definition of Arriving Alien, 63 Fed. Reg. 19,382 (Apr. 20, 1998).  \nThe INS reasoned that such aliens constituted a “group[ ] not best regarded as arriving aliens for \npurposes of the applicability of expedited removal” because they had been “initially paroled before \n(often well before) the effective date of the expedited removal provisions.”  63 Fed. Reg. at 19,382.  \nThe regulation similarly exempted aliens who were paroled pursuant to a grant of “advance parole” \nthat they applied for and were granted while physically present in the United States to allow for \ntemporarily departure and return.  Id. at 19,382-83.  The rule thus ameliorated the reach of the \narriving alien definition for certain discrete groups (including aliens who had been paroled “well \nbefore” the enactment of the expedited removal provisions) vis-à-vis expedited removal but \notherwise provided that all other aliens encompassed within the definition would remain arriving \naliens and therefore subject to expedited removal.  \nAnd in 2006, the regulatory definitions were amended to specifically provide, as they do \nnow, that an arriving alien includes aliens who are paroled “even after any such parole is terminated \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 16 of 55\n     \n \nor revoked.”  8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2, 1001.1(q); see Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings \nto Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction to Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of \nStatus, 71 Fed. Reg. 27,585, 27,591 (May 12, 2006).  The 2006 rule also clarified that the exempted \nclasses remain arriving aliens for all purposes except for expedited removal.  See 71 Fed. Reg. at \n27,588.   \nWith respect to the designation provision at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), the Secretary of \nHomeland Security (and Commissioner of the legacy INS  in 2002) have on five occasions \nexercised this designation authority.3  See 67 Fed. Reg. 68,924 (Nov. 13, 2002) (designating for \nexpedited removal qualifying aliens who arrive in the United States by sea, who are not admitted \nor paroled, and have not been physically present in the U.S. continuously for two years prior to the \ndetermination of inadmissibility); 69 Fed. Reg. 48,877 (Aug. 11, 2004) (designating qualifying \naliens encountered within 100 air miles of the border and within fourteen days of their date of \nillegal entry regardless of the alien’s arrival method)4; 82 Fed. Reg. 4,902 (Jan. 17, 2017) \n(extending all  prior designations to Cuban nationals); 84 Fed. Reg. 35,409 (July 23, 2019) \n(designating qualifying aliens who have not shown that they have been physically present in the \n \n3   In 1997, the Attorney General established a mechanism for later designations of classes of aliens \nsubject to expedited removal.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii).  The Attorney General observed that “a \nproposed expansion of the expedited removal procedures may occur at any time and may be driven \neither by specific situations such as a sudden influx of illegal aliens motivated by political or \neconomic unrest or other events or by a general need to increase the effectiveness of enforcement \noperations at one or more locations.”  62 Fed. Reg. at 10,314.   \n4   The 2004 Notice explained that, to focus limited resources “upon unlawful entries that have a \nclose spatial and temporal nexus to the border,” it did not implement “the full nationwide \nexpedited removal authority available to DHS.”  Id. at 48,879.  It did, however, expressly reserve \nDHS’s option of “implementing the full nationwide enforcement authority of the statute through \npublication of a subsequent Federal Register notice.”  Id. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 17 of 55\n     \n \nUnited States  continuously for the  two-year period immediately preceding the date of  the \ndetermination of  inadmissibility); 87  Fed.  Reg.  16,022 (Mar.  21, 2022)  (rescinding 2019 \ndesignation). \nThe most recent designation of aliens under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) occurred on \nJanuary 24, 2025, following President Trump’s Executive Order 14159, Protecting the American \nPeople from Invasion, 90 Fed. Reg. 8443 (Jan. 20, 2025).  The Acting Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity published a Federal Register notice restoring the scope of expedited removal to “the \nfullest extent authorized by Congress.”  Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8,139 (Jan. 24, 2025).  The notice enabled DHS “to place in expedited removal, with limited \nexceptions, aliens determined to be inadmissible under [8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C) or (a)(7)] who \nhave not been admitted or paroled into the United States and who have not affirmatively shown, \nto the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that they have been physically present in the United \nStates continuously for the two-year period immediately preceding the date of the determination \nof inadmissibility,” who were not covered by previous designations.  Id. at 8,139-40.  The notice \nexplained that this action aimed to “enhance national security and public safety—while reducing \ngovernment costs—by facilitating prompt immigration determinations” and would “enable DHS \nto address more effectively and efficiently the large volume of aliens who are present in the United \nStates unlawfully ... and ensure the prompt removal from the United States of those not entitled to \nenter, remain, or be provided relief or protection from removal.”  Id. at 8139.  Plaintiffs do not \nchallenge that expansion in this case.5  Compl., at ¶¶ 14, 52. \n \n5  The designation is being challenged in other litigation in this District.  Make the Road New \nYork v. Noem, No. 1:25-cv-00190 (D.D.C.), ECF No. 1.   \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 18 of 55\n     \n \nB.  Parole.  Congress has long provided authority to immigration officials to use parole to \nrelease aliens into the interior of the United States, emphasizing that parole is not an “admission” \nwithin the meaning of the INA.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(13)(B), 1182(d)(5)(A).  As amended in 1996, \nthe relevant statute provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security “may ... in [her] discretion \nparole” an “alien applying for admission,” and specifies that such a parole is done “temporarily \nunder such conditions as [the Secretary] may prescribe [and] only on a case-by-case basis for \nurgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  The statute \nfurther states that parole may be terminated “when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion \nof the Secretary of Homeland Security, have been served.”  Id.  Thus, the grant of parole and its \ntermination is committed to the broad discretion of the Secretary.   \nParole is not an admission to the United States.  Id.; see id. § 1101(a)(13)(B).  “[A]liens \nwho arrive at ports of entry—even those paroled elsewhere in the country for years pending \nremoval—are ‘treated’ for due process purposes ‘as if stopped at the border.’”  Thuraissigiam, 591 \nU.S. at 139 (quoting Shaughnessy v. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 215 (1953)); see \nalso Leng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 188-90 (1958).  There are multiple ways in which \nparole can expire or be terminated; among other possibilities, service of a document charging the \nalien with being removable terminates parole.  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2).  And when parole ends, the \nalien “shall be restored to the status that he or she had at the time of parole.” Id.  “[W]hen the \npurposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland Security, have been \nserved the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and \nthereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant \nfor admission to the United States.”  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (emphasis added). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 19 of 55\n     \n \nII.  Recent Developments Serving as the Ground of the Complaint \nPlaintiffs argue that aliens who are “arriving” in the U.S. and paroled at ports of entry \ncannot be subject to expedited removal.  In asserting their first two claims—violations of the INA \nand APA—Plaintiffs rely on three documents that are discussed below.  Compl., ¶¶ 102-112. \nThe first document is a memorandum issued on January 23, 2025 by then-Acting Secretary \nof Homeland Security Benjamine C. Huffman to senior DHS officials setting forth guidance on \nhow to exercise enforcement discretion in light of a recent “clarifi[cation]” of DHS’s policy \nregarding the scope of the parole statute and its recent expansion of expedited removal consistent \nwith its statutory authority.  Memorandum from Benjamine C. Huffman, Acting Secretary (Jan. \n23,  2025)  (“Huffman  Memo”),  available  at  https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2025-\n01/25_0123_er-and-parole-guidance.pdf (last accessed May 27, 2025).  The Huffman Memo \ninstructs immigration enforcement to take “all steps necessary to review [an] alien’s case and \nconsider, in exercising [] enforcement discretion, whether to apply expedited removal,” which \n“may include” terminating other removal proceedings or active parole status.  Id.  For aliens who \nare not subject to expedited removal and have “been granted parole under a policy that may be \npaused, modified, or terminated immediately under the January 20 memorandum,” the Huffman \nMemo instructs DHS officials to “consider, in exercising [their] enforcement discretion, whether \nany such alien should be placed in removal proceedings” or whether “parole remains appropriate \nin light of any changed legal or factual circumstances.”  Id.  Finally, the Memo directs that “[t]he \nactions contemplated by this memorandum shall be taken in a manner consistent with applicable, \nstatutes, regulations, and court orders.”  Id.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 20 of 55\n     \n \nThe second document Plaintiffs rely on is, according to Plaintiffs, a “directive” sent by ICE \nleadership to Enforcement and Removal Operations personnel “directing such officers to consider \nfor expedited removal ‘paroled arriving aliens’ who have not applied affirmatively for asylum with \nUSCIS.”  Compl., ¶ 56.  Plaintiffs allege that the directive states:  “[t]here is no time limit on the \npossibility to process such aliens for [expedited removal],” and contend that this “expos[es] \nindividuals paroled into the United States after inspection at a port of entry to the indefinite threat \nof this fast-track removal process.”  Id. \nFinally, the third document Plaintiffs rely on is a March 2025 Federal Register Notice from \nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem ending certain parole programs.  Termination of \nParole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,611 (Mar. \n25, 2025) (“March 2025 FRN”).  Plaintiffs’ reliance on this document requires some background. \nIn the prior Biden Administration, DHS established several parole programs, including \nthose for individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela (“CHNV” programs).  Under \nthe CHNV programs, nationals of those countries who met certain eligibility requirements, \nincluding have a U.S.-based “supporter,” could be considered for advance authorization to travel \nto interior United States ports of entry to request parole for up to a two-year term.  Implementation \nof a Parole Process for Venezuelans, 87 Fed. Reg. 63,507 (Oct. 19, 2022), as amended by 88 Fed. \nReg. 1279 (Jan. 9, 2023); 88 Fed. Reg. 1266 (Jan. 9, 2023) (same for Cubans); 88 Fed. Reg. 1243 \n(Jan. 9, 2023) (same for Haitians); 88 Fed. Reg. 1255 (Jan. 9, 2023) (same for Nicaraguans).  The \nCHNV parole programs were paused in July 2024 due to fraud concerns.6   \n \n6  Stephen Dinan, “‘Parole’ program put on hold amid massive fraud,” Wash. Times (Aug. 2, 2024), \n \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 21 of 55\n     \n \nIn a notice published on March 25, 2025, DHS terminated the CHNV parole programs.7  \nUpon re-examination and based on DHS’s experience, Secretary Noem determined that the CHNV \nprograms “do not serve a significant public benefit, are not necessary to reduce levels of illegal \nimmigration, did not sufficiently mitigate the domestic effects of illegal immigration, are not \nserving their intended purposes, and are inconsistent with the Administration’s foreign policy \ngoals.”  Id. at 13,612.  To the extent that “urgent humanitarian reasons” supported any grants of \nparole under CHNV, “DHS believes that [such] reasons for granting parole [are] best addressed on \na case-by-case basis consistent with the statute, and taking into consideration each alien’s specific \ncircumstances.”  Id.  Thus, the Secretary determined that grants of parole under CHNV that had \nnot already expired by April 24, 2025, were to terminate on that date unless the Secretary decides \nto the contrary in individual cases.  90 Fed. Reg. at 13,611.   \nIn addressing the effect of such termination on existing parolees and reliance interests, the \nSecretary determined any reliance interests were outweighed by the fact that allowing parole to \nexpire on its own terms would enable some aliens to accrue more than two years of presence in \n \navailable at  https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/aug/2/dhs-suspends-parole-program-\namid-rampant-fraud/ (last accessed May 14, 2025). \n7  Plaintiffs do not challenge the termination of the CHNV programs parole in this case.  See \nCompl., ¶¶ 1, 13–14, 45.  That challenge is raised in Svitlana Doe v. Noem, No. 1:25-cv-10495 (D. \nMass. Apr. 14, 2025).  The District Court for the District of Massachusetts issued a preliminary \nstay in that case under 5 U.S.C. § 705 enjoining the DHS Secretary’s March 25, 2025 termination \nof parole grants for those previously granted parole under the CHNV programs.  Id at *20.  The \nGovernment filed a notice of appeal in that case and an emergency stay of the district court’s order, \nwhich was denied by the First Circuit on May 5, 2025.  No. 25-1384.  The Government filed an \nemergency motion for a stay with the Supreme Court which the Court granted on May 30, 2025, \npending the disposition of the Government’s appeal in the First Circuit.

Ct. --, \n2025 WL 1534782 (2025). \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 22 of 55\n     \n \nthe United States, which would mean that DHS could not remove them by expedited removal but \nwould instead have to initiate the more lengthy process of a full removal hearing under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a.  Id. at 13,619 (“If DHS were to allow the CHNV parolee population to remain for the full \nduration of their two-year parole, DHS would be compelled to place a greater proportion of this \npopulation in section 240 removal proceedings to effectuate their removal, further straining the \nalready over-burdened immigration court system”) (citations and footnote omitted)); see also id. \nat 13,620 (same effect).   \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nRule 12(b)(1).  A court must dismiss a case pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) when it lacks \nstatutory or  constitutional jurisdiction.   Under this  Rule,  Plaintiffs  “bear[] the  burden of \nestablishing jurisdiction by a preponderance of the evidence.”  Rohrbaugh v. Pompeo, 394 F. Supp. \n3d 128, 131 (D.D.C. 2019).  Additionally, “the court need not accept unsupported inferences or \nlegal conclusions cast as factual allegations” to make a finding of subject matter jurisdiction.  \nDickerson v. District of Columbia, 70 F. Supp. 3d 311, 318 (D.D.C. 2014). \nRule 12(b)(6).  Under Rule 12(b)(6), a party may move to dismiss a complaint on the \ngrounds that it “fail[s] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  \n“[A] complaint [does not] suffice if it tenders ‘naked assertion[s]’ devoid of ‘further factual \nenhancement.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 557 (2007)).  Rather, a complaint must contain sufficient factual allegations that, if \naccepted as true, “state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.”  Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570.  \n“A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to \ndraw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  Iqbal, 556 \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 23 of 55\n     \n \nU.S. at 678.  Finally, as “a court can fully resolve any purely legal question on a motion to dismiss, \nthere is no inherent barrier to reaching the merits at the 12(b)(6) stage.”  Marshall Cnty. Health \nCare Auth. v. Shalala, 988 F.2d 1221, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  The Court can make this adjudication \nwithout a record when the complaint “actually presents no factual allegations, but rather only \narguments about the legal conclusion to be drawn about the agency action.”  Id.  “As a result, the \nsufficiency of the complaint is the question on the merits[.]”8  Id. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims for Several Reasons \nA.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing \nPlaintiff organizations challenge the legality of the three DHS documents described above \nregarding DHS  officials’ exercise of enforcement discretion with respect to placing former \nrecipients of parole in expedited removal.  See Compl. ¶¶ 1, 13–14, 102–15 and “Prayer for Relief.”  \nIn doing so, Plaintiffs assert claims on behalf of various members of theirs who were granted parole \nstatus, despite not being directly subject to DHS’s documents themselves.  Compl. ¶¶ 60–75 \n(CHIR), ¶¶ 76–89 (UndocuBlack), ¶¶ 90–100 (CASA).  Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate how \n \n8 Local Civil Rule 7(n) requires Defendants to file a certified list of the administrative record \ncontents when answering the Complaint with a dispositive motion.  This Local Rule applies to \ncases involving “judicial review of administrative agency action.”  Id.  However, Defendants \nrespectfully request that the Court relieve them of compliance with this rule.  Defendants’ motion \ndoes not require reference to an administrative record—it is premised on Plaintiffs’ Complaint, \nand not on any further factual development.  See Arab v. Blinken, 600 F. Supp. 3d 59, 66 n.2 \n(D.D.C. 2022) (“Following the general practice in this Court, defendants’ motion to waive \ncompliance with Local Civil Rule 7(n) is granted because ‘the administrative record is not \nnecessary for [the court’s] decision.’”) (alteration in original) (citing Connecticut v. U.S. Dep’t of \nthe Interior, 344 F. Supp. 3d 279, 294 (D.D.C. 2018) (granting the Government’s motion to be \nrelieved of complying with Local Civil Rule 7(n) when the administrative record was not required \nto decide defendants’ motion to dismiss)).  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 24 of 55\n     \n \nthe three challenged actions cause harm to their organizational interests.  Consequently, Plaintiffs \nlack Article III standing to seek their requested prospective relief.  \nAs the parties invoking federal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing the \nthree elements that constitute the “irreducible constitutional minimum of standing,”—namely that \nthat they have (1) suffered an “injury in fact”—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is \n“concrete and particularized,” “actual or imminent” and not “conjectural” or “hypothetical” that is \n(2) “fairly traceable” to the challenged conduct of Defendants, and will (3) “likely” be redressed \nby a favorable decision.  Lujan v. Def. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992); FDA v. All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 380 (2024).  There are two ways for an organization to establish \nstanding.  See Abigail All. for Better Access to Developmental Drugs v. Eschenbach, 469 F.3d 129, \n132 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  First, an organizational plaintiff can bring action “on its own behalf,” which \nis known as “organizational standing.”  Id.  Second, a plaintiff organization can demonstrate \nstanding by  bringing a  claim  “on  behalf of  its  members,” also  known as  “associational \nstanding.”  Id.    \nPlaintiffs’  Complaint  establishes  neither  organizational  nor  associational \nstanding.  Beginning with organizational standing, all three organizational Plaintiffs in this suit \nhave waived any reliance on organizational standing by failing to plead it in their complaint.  See \nCompl., ¶ 59 (generally alleging that “Defendants’ directives to apply expedited removal to \nparolees cause Plaintiffs’  members substantial injury” (emphasis added)), ¶¶ 60–75 (CHIR), \n¶¶ 76–89 (UndocuBlack), ¶¶ 90–100 (CASA); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Haaland, 849 F. \nApp’x 2, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (“[T]he Center did not purport to raise an organizational injury below \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 25 of 55\n     \n \n. . . . To the extent the Center advances any other basis for organizational standing on appeal, those \narguments are waived.”).   \nIn any event, none of the three Plaintiffs can establish organizational standing because they \nhave failed to identify any legally cognizable injury to themselves.  Cf. People for the Ethical \nTreatment of Animals v. USDA, 797 F.3d 1087, 1094 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“PETA”) (holding that PETA \nsuffered injuries “concrete and specific to the work in which they are engaged” sufficient to \nestablish organizational standing at the motion-to-dismiss stage).  Each Plaintiff suggests that the \nchallenged actions indirectly impact it via its effect on aliens who may be clients and subjected to \nexpedited removal procedures.  See Compl., ¶¶ 60–75 (CHIR), ¶¶ 76–89 (UndocuBlack), ¶¶ \n90--100 (CASA).   But a plaintiff—organization or otherwise—generally “lacks a judicially \ncognizable interest in the prosecution or non-prosecution of another.”  Linda R.S. v. Richard D., \n410 U.S. 614, 619 (1973).  \nThe closest Plaintiffs come to pleading organizational standing is a bare, single-sentence \nallegation that it has “devoted significant resources to deportation defense and preparing its \nmembership for potential immigration enforcement actions, including developing new ‘Know \nYour Rights’ resources and devoting additional resources to immigration counseling and rapid \nresponse to immigration enforcement” due to the three challenged actions.  Compl., ¶ 100; accord. \nCompl. ¶ 82 (UndocuBlack alleging it has created a Frequently Asked Questions resource and \nconducted “Know Your Rights” trainings).   But mere “self-serving observation[s]” that an \norganization will “have to increase the resources that it spends on educating the general public and \nits members” about the consequences of government regulation are “insufficient to support \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 26 of 55\n     \n \nstanding.”  CHIR v. DHS, No. 1:250-cv-00943, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 1078776, at *5 (D.D.C. \nApr. 10, 2025).   \nIndeed, the Supreme Court rejected such attenuated theories of standing in Alliance for \nHippocratic Medicine, 602 U.S. at 391–92.  There, the Court held that a group of doctors could \nnot assert standing to challenge agency actions affecting third parties—and in their view, removing \nprotections and “public safety requirements” that might otherwise apply to those third parties—\nsimply because the doctors might later be called upon to provide medical services to those \nindividuals.  Id.  Such an “attenuated” theory of standing, the Court reasoned, would improperly \nallow doctors to challenge virtually any change in policy that might indirectly affect the health or \nsafety of potential patients because it might affect the number of patients they serve, or the time \ninvolved in helping those patients.  Id.  There “would be no principled way to cabin such a \nsweeping doctrinal change” that would allow various groups to challenge policies affecting their \npotential clients,  such  as  “[t]eachers in  border states”  “su[ing] to  challenge” changes to \n“immigration policies” that would affect the number of students in their classrooms.  Id. at \n392.  The “Court has consistently rejected” such an “approach to standing” “as flatly inconsistent \nwith Article III.”  Id.   \nTurning next to associational standing, Plaintiffs have failed to make the necessary \nshowing.  “Ordinarily, a party must assert his own legal rights and cannot rest his claim to relief \non the legal rights of third parties.”  Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57 (2017) (cleaned \nup).  Courts will not recognize standing to assert others’ rights unless the third-party plaintiff has \n“a close relationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is a hindrance to the \npossessor’s ability to protect his own interests.”  Id. (alteration in original); see also Kowalski v. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 27 of 55\n     \n \nTesmer, 543 U.S. 125, 130 (2004); AILA v. Reno, 199 F.3d 1352, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2000).  An \nassociation may bring a lawsuit on behalf of its members if certain conditions are met:  its members \nhave standing to sue in their own right, the interests the association seeks to protect align with its \norganizational purpose, and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires individual \nmembers to participate in the litigation.  See Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. \n333, 343 (1977); Animal Legal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Vilsack, 111 F.4th 1219, 1225 (D.C. Cir. 2024) \n(same).   \nHere, Plaintiffs have not cleared any of the necessary hurdles to establish associational \nstanding.  To begin with, no Plaintiff has shown that its members would have standing to sue in \ntheir own right, considering they fail to allege that the “policy” they identify has been enforced \nagainst—or even threatened to be enforced against—any of their members.  See Compl., ¶¶ 60-75 \n(CHIR), ¶¶ 76–89 (UndocuBlack), ¶¶ 90–100 (CASA).  Instead, Plaintiffs simply speculate about \npossible future harm to their members—that some of their members who were paroled into the \nUnited States may be subjected to expedited removal resulting in “abrupt family separation” and \nloss of income and may suffer from perceived “flaw[s]” in the expedited removal process, \nincluding not having time to submit their claims for relief or evidence supporting those claims.  \nCompl., ¶¶ 68-70, 73 (CHIR), ¶¶ 81-83 (UndocuBlack); see Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 \nU.S. 398, 409 (2013) (“[W]e have repeatedly reiterated that threatened injury must be certainly \nimpending to constitute injury in fact, and that allegations of possible future injury are not \nsufficient”) (cleaned up). \nPlaintiffs’ feared injuries rely on a chain of hypothetical events that fail to amount to \ninjuries in fact that are “concrete and particularized” and “actual or imminent,” but rather, injuries \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 28 of 55\n     \n \nthat are “conjectural” or “hypothetical.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61.  In their hypothetical chain of \nevents, Plaintiffs first speculate that DHS officials will place their members in expedited removal, \neven though the DHS documents at issue merely remind officers of their existing authority and \ndiscretion to do so.   See supra at 8-10; see also Compl., ¶¶ 68-70, 73 (CHIR), ¶¶ 81-83 \n(UndocuBlack).  In fact, the February 18, 2025 guidance document actually undermines their \nargument; while Plaintiffs assert that many of its members fear persecution or torture if returned \nto their home countries, the February 18 guidance, according to Plaintiffs themselves, suggests \nthat aliens who have pending asylum applications should not be considered for expedited removal.  \nSee Compl., ¶ 56.   \nNext, Plaintiffs  speculate that  expedited removal, as  opposed to  8  U.S.C.  § 1229a \nproceedings (before an Immigration Judge), will result in their members’ abrupt family separation, \nremoval to “dangerous circumstances abroad,” loss of income, and failure to apply for immigration \nbenefits.9  But Plaintiffs provide no support for their speculation that, lacking legal status in the \nUnited States, they are entitled to protracted proceedings simply for the sake of avoiding these \nharms through delay of the inevitable.  See generally Compl.  Likewise, their claim that their \n \n9  See Compl., ¶ 74 (CHIR alleging that possible application of expedited removal to its members \nwould be harmful “because of the rapid, summary nature of the process,” which it alleges would \ndeprive “some” members “of the opportunity to submit applications for immigration protections \nthey are entitled to”); Compl., ¶ 84 (UndocuBlack alleging that the credible fear screening process \nis flawed and can result in people with valid asylum claims being removed to “dangerous \ncircumstances abroad”); Compl., ¶¶ 94-100 (CASA alleging that it “has heard from its members” \nthat there is “widespread confusion and fear from the administration’s decisions to end parole \nprocesses and expand expedited removal,” that there has been a chilling effect on its members \npreventing them for applying for further immigration benefits, and that CASA members who “may \nbe eligible for asylum or Convention Against Torture protections” fear they could be deported \nthrough expedited removal and “do not know” if  their case will  be “properly heard by an \nimmigration judge”). \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 29 of 55\n     \n \nplacement in expedited removal proceedings will result in their members dropping the ball on \nfiling applications for relief or having them denied is also rampant speculation.  Expedited removal \nproceedings by statute and regulation provide that if an alien indicates an intention to apply for \nasylum or expresses a fear of persecution or torture or of return, the alien will be referred to an \nasylum officer for a credible fear interview.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4).  And \nPlaintiffs plead that they have provided their members Frequently Asked Questions resources and \nconducted “Know Your Rights” trainings concerning expedited removal, Compl. ¶¶ 60–100, which \nwould alleviate some of these speculative concerns.   \nIn sum, because Plaintiffs’ claims rely on a hypothetical chain of events, starting with \nspeculation about how DHS officials will use their already existing discretion and ending with \nspeculative harm they imagine may occur from receiving expedited (versus 8 U.S.C. § 1229a) \nproceedings, they have failed to plead an actual or imminent injury sufficient for associational \nstanding at the first step.  See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61; CHIR, 2025 WL 1078776, at *5 (“Article \nIII requires more than maybes—it demands that harms be ‘actual or imminent.’”).   \nPlaintiffs have failed their burden to establish the first requirement for standing for another \nreason, too: they have not shown that the associational harm they allege (having their members \nplaced in the expedited removal proceedings they were already subject to under the expedited \nremoval regulations promulgated in 1997) “has a close relationship to a harm traditionally \nrecognized as providing a basis for a lawsuit in American courts.”  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 440 (2021).  As TransUnion made clear, Plaintiffs must “identif[y] a close historical \nor common-law analogue for their asserted injury” to demonstrate their asserted injury is concrete.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 30 of 55\n     \n \nId. at 424.  Certain harms readily fit this bill, such as “traditional tangible harms” like “physical \nharms and monetary harms.”  Id. at 425.   \nPlaintiffs’ claims here rely on speculation that Defendants’ discretionary decision to act \nwithin their existing legal authority to apply expedited removal will cause their members greater \ndegrees of harm than § 1229a removal proceedings, though § 1229a removal proceedings would \nsurely cause the same alleged types of harms (family separation, removal to potentially dangerous \ncircumstances abroad, etc.).  Plaintiffs fail to “identif[y] a close historical or common-law analogue \nfor their asserted injury” to demonstrate their asserted injury is concrete.  Id. at 424.  Furthermore, \nthe “policies” that Plaintiffs challenge do not vest Defendants with any additional authority; they \nsimply direct  subordinates to  wield  their existing power under the applicable statues and \nregulations, which have allowed DHS to place aliens once granted parole into expedited removal \nproceedings since 1997.  See supra at 8-10.  As such, Plaintiffs have failed to show how the DHS \nguidance documents have caused them a concrete injury.  See CHIR, 2025 WL 1078776, at *5 \n(“Plaintiffs have failed to show that the mere requirement to abide by the law . . . constitutes a \nconcrete injury for  standing purposes.”).   Consequently, Plaintiffs  have failed  to  allege a \ncognizable injury in fact to their members sufficient to establish associational standing. \nPlaintiffs also fail to establish the other standing requirements:  that their members’ \nspeculated injuries would be “fairly traceable” to the Defendants’ guidance and will “likely” be \nredressed by a favorable decision granting Plaintiffs a preliminary injunction.  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n560-61.  As to  traceability, the DHS  guidance documents Plaintiffs  challenge do not  vest \nDefendants with any additional authority.  As discussed above, they merely direct officials to \n“consider” using expedited removal; they do not require it.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 31 of 55\n     \n \nAs to redressability, the relief Plaintiffs request, even if granted, would not prevent their \nmembers’ asserted harms.  Plaintiffs do not dispute that DHS has broad discretion to revoke parole \nand place their members into section 1229a removal proceedings; and DHS can clearly do so \nbecause paroled aliens remain applicants for admission who are authorized to remain in the country \npursuant to such discretionary authority.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  As a result, Plaintiffs \ncannot establish redressability because all of their alleged harms—arrest, detention, and removal \nfrom the United States, “family separation,” loss of income, “financial and psychological harm,” \nsee Compl., ¶¶ 8, 83, 85, 87, 95—are simply the expected consequences of removal, whether DHS \ninitiates expedited removal or removal proceedings under section 1229a.  And to the extent \nPlaintiffs imply that their members will not have an opportunity to raise their fears of persecution \nor torture in expedited removal proceedings, see id., ¶¶ 10-11, 68-70, 96-97, as they can in section \n1229a proceedings, that suggestion is wrong; they can raise such fear claims through the credible \nfear process that is available in expedited removal.10  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. \n§§ 235.3(b)(4), 208.30.  Similarly, whether or not certain members lose their Temporary Protected \n \n10 Perhaps recognizing this point, Plaintiffs attack the credible fear procedures as inadequate.  \nCompl., ¶ 84 (alleging “flaws in the credible fear screening process”); see also id., ¶ 74.  But \nPlaintiffs fails to elaborate on these allegations and, in any event, they do not assert a specific \nchallenge to these procedures in any of their three claims; nor could they, see Dep’t of Homeland \nSec. v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. 103, 139 (2020) (reaffirming that whatever procedures Congress \nprovides for  admission of arriving aliens is  sufficient).   Furthermore, statistics  undermine \nPlaintiffs’ allegations by showing that over the years a large number of expedited removal aliens \nwho have asserted a fear have been found to have a credible fear and referred to proceedings before \nan immigration judge to apply for asylum.  Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. at 113 (noting that over a ten-\nyear period, “about 50%” of applicants were found to have a credible fear). \n \n \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 32 of 55\n     \n \nStatus (TPS) following the Secretary’s termination of the relevant country’s TPS designation under \n8 U.S.C. § 1254a(b)(3) has nothing to do with what type of removal proceeding DHS commences.  \nSee id., ¶¶ 12, 83, 85.  And although Plaintiffs state that expedited removal would “deprive” some \nmembers of “the opportunity to submit” immigration applications, id., ¶ 74, they fail to explain \nwhat immigration relief they are eligible to apply for in section 1229a removal proceedings that is \nnot available in expedited removal.  In a nutshell, Plaintiffs have failed to show redressability \nbecause the same harms they allege will result from expedited removal also will result from \n§ 1229a removal proceedings, and it is insufficient to claim nothing more than that expedited \nremoval will happen more quickly.  See id. (“[e]xpedited removal . . . . would be particularly \nharmful because of the rapid, summary nature of the process”).  \nFor all these reasons, the Court should dismiss this case at the threshold for failure to \nestablish Article III standing. \nB.  Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252 This Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over the Plaintiffs’      \nClaims, and Further, Lacks Authority to Issue Injunctive Relief \nAs this Court has noted, 8 U.S.C. § 1252 “is one of the most comprehensive jurisdiction-\nstripping statutes in the United States Code.”  D.A.M. v. Barr, 474 F. Supp. 3d 45, 62 (D.D.C. \n2020).  Numerous provisions of that statute preclude this Court’s jurisdiction and bar the Court \nfrom granting injunctive relief in this case.   \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 33 of 55\n     \n \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Challenges to Expedited Removal Are Time-Barred \nPlaintiffs claim that the Court has jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3).11  But their \nclaims are out of time under that statute.  Section 1252(a)(2)(A), entitled “Review relating to \nsection 1225(b)(1)),” provides: \nNotwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), including \nsection 2241 of Title 28, or any other habeas corpus provision, and sections 1361 \nand 1651 of such title, no court shall have jurisdiction to review— \n*  *  * \n(ii) except as provided in subsection (e), a decision by the Attorney General to \ninvoke the provisions of such section [section 1225(b)(1)],  \n(iii) the application of such section to individual aliens, including the determination \nmade under section 1225(b)(1)(B) of this title, or \n(iv) except as provided in subsection (e), procedures and policies adopted by the \nAttorney General to implement the provisions of section 1225(b)(1) of this title. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  Therefore, the INA precludes challenges to DHS’s \ndecision to “invoke” the expedited removal procedure or to apply it to “individual aliens” “except \nas provided under subsection (e)” of section 1252.   In turn, subsection (e)(3)(A), entitled \n“Challenges on Validity of the System,” provides: \nJudicial review of determinations under section 1225(b) of this  title  and its \nimplementation is available in an action instituted in the United States District \nCourt for the District of Columbia, but shall be limited to determinations of— \n \n11  They also cite 28 U.S.C. § 1331.  Although 28 U.S.C. § 1331 generally supplies jurisdiction \nover federal questions, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A) eliminates jurisdiction for claims related to the \ndecision to invoke the provisions of the expedited removal statute unless expressly permitted by 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(e).  See Make the Road v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 612, 626 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  Here, section \n1252(a)(2)(A), titled “Matters not subject to judicial review,” removes from federal courts any \njurisdiction, “[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law,” including section 1331, jurisdiction \nto review Plaintiffs claims “relating to section 1225(b)(1),” i.e., expedited removal.  See Patchak \nv. Zinke, 583 U.S. 244, 248-49 (2018) (the jurisdictional provision encompasses 28 U.S.C. § 1331). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 34 of 55\n     \n \n(i) whether such section, or any regulation issued to implement such section, is \nconstitutional; or \n(ii) whether such a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, \nor written procedure issued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to \nimplement such section, is  not  consistent with  applicable provisions of this \nsubchapter or is otherwise in violation of law. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A).  \nCritically,  there  is  a  sixty-day deadline for  filing  such an  action.   Under  section \n1252(e)(3)(B) these types of systematic challenges shall be filed “no later than 60 days after the \ndate the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or procedure . . . is first implemented.”  \nThat deadline is jurisdictional and it is not excused by a post sixty-day discovery that a particular \nindividual will be subject to expedited removal.  AILA, 18 F. Supp. at 47 (“The Court reaches this \nconclusion because Congress designed the statute so that the 60 days ran from a fixed point, the \ninitial implementation of the challenged provisions, rather than from the date of application of \nIIRIRA to a particular alien.”).   \n  In this case, Plaintiffs challenge several DHS documents and argue that those documents \nprovide incorrect guidance because aliens paroled at a port of entry are not subject to expedited \nremoval.  See, e.g., Compl., ¶ 13.  They also allege that application of expedited removal to their \nmembers will  violate due process.   Compl., ¶ 114.   However, as  explained below, DHS \npromulgated a regulation effective on April 1, 1997 defining an “arriving alien” as “an alien who \nseeks admission . . . at a port-of-entry” and clarified that such an alien remains an arriving alien \n“even if paroled.”  62 Fed. Reg. at 10,312 (codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1.2).  Plaintiffs cannot challenge \nthe conclusion that they are subject to expedited removal or the adequacy of these procedures \nbecause their complaint was not filed within sixty days of April 1, 1997.   \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 35 of 55\n     \n \n  Congress  created  expedited removal  through  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \nImmigration Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009 (Sept. 30, \n1996).  See id. § 309(a), 110 Stat. 3009–625 (April 1, 1997 effective date).  That statute provided \nthat aliens arriving in the United States (“an alien . . . arriving in the United States”) and aliens \ndesignated by the responsible official (“an alien . . . described in clause (iii)”) who met the other \nrequirements were subject to expedited removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  Congress did not \ndefine the term “arriving alien.”  But in an interim final rule effective April 1, 1997, the Department \nof Justice defined the term as including precisely the group that Plaintiffs say are not subject to \nexpedited removal: \nThe term arriving alien means an alien who seeks admission to or transit through \nthe United States, as provided in 8 CFR part 235, at a port-of-entry, or an alien \nwho is interdicted in international or United States waters and brought into the \nUnited States by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, and \nregardless of the means of transport.  An arriving alien remains such even if paroled \npursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act. \n62 Fed. Reg. at 10,312; 8 C.F.R. § 1.1(q) (1998) (emphases added).  If Plaintiffs wanted to contest \nthe regulation’s inclusion of aliens paroled at a port of entry as within the group of “arriving aliens” \nsubject to expedited removal, they had to do so within sixty days after April 1, 1997.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(B); see AILA, 199 F.3d at 1355.  The same holds true for Plaintiffs’ due process \nchallenge to expedited removal.  The present complaint was filed decades out of time and therefore \nshould be dismissed.  That is so even if Plaintiffs’ members did not themselves become “arriving \naliens” and subject to expedited removal until long after the deadline passed.  AILA, 18 F. Supp. \n2d at 47.  Thus, the Court may dismiss the suit as all three of Plaintiffs’ claims (i.e., the INA claim, \nAPA claim, and due process claim) are jurisdictionally time-barred.  \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 36 of 55\n     \n \n  Plaintiffs may contend their suit is timely because their complaint was filed within 60 days \nof the DHS guidance and Federal Register Notice they challenge but, as discussed in more detail \nin Section II (addressing the merits of the APA claim), these documents do not establish a new rule \nor policy regarding the application of expedited removal to their members but merely remind \nimmigration officials of their well-established authority to exercise prosecutorial discretion in \nconsidering whether to apply expedited removal in certain situations.  The authority to apply \nexpedited removal to aliens paroled at a port of entry is grounded in the expedited removal statute \nand implementing regulation, which went into effect in 1997.  Thus, the Court should dismiss the \nsuit as all three of Plaintiffs’ claims, the INA claim, APA claim, and due process claim, are out of \ntime.   \n2.  The Relief That Plaintiffs Seek Is Also Squarely Foreclosed by 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g) \nThe thrust of Plaintiff’s action seeks to “[e]njoin Defendants from applying expedited \nremoval to noncitizens who have previously been granted parole at a port of entry.”  Compl. at 34, \nPrayer for Relief, section 4.  That claim falls directly within section 1252(g)’s preclusion of review \nfor actions seeking to challenge DHS’s commencement of removal proceedings, and therefore the \nCourt should dismiss the complaint on this ground as well.   \nSection 1252(g) provides that “notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or \nnonstatutory) . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any \nalien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to [1] commence proceedings, \n[2] adjudicate cases, or [3] execute removal orders against any alien,” except through a petition \nfor review from a final order of removal filed in a court of appeals.  (Emphasis added).  Though \nthis section “does not sweep broadly,” Tazu v. Att’y Gen. U.S., 975 F.3d 292, 296 (3d Cir. 2020), \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 37 of 55\n     \n \nits “narrow sweep is firm,” E.F.L. v. Prim, 986 F.3d 959, 964-65 (7th Cir. 2021).  Courts “cannot \nentertain challenges to the enumerated executive branch decisions or actions” outside a petition \nfor review.  E.F.L., 986 F.3d at 964.  The Supreme Court has explained that 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) is \n“directed against a particular evil: attempts to impose judicial constraints upon prosecutorial \ndiscretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 & n.9 (“Section 1252(g) seems clearly designed to give some \nmeasure of protection to . . . discretionary determinations.”). \n  Plaintiffs,  “on behalf”  of  their  members, request that  this  Court  “impose judicial \nconstraints” on DHS’s “prosecutorial” decision to “commence” expedited removal proceedings \nagainst those members.  But that is one of the actions that § 1252(g) bars. AADC is directly on \npoint: There the Court held that § 1252(g) precluded the district court’s review of the aliens’ \nselective  prosecution claims  which  sought  to  enjoin  the  Government from  commencing \ndeportation proceedings.  As the Court explained, the aliens’ challenge in that case to the decision \nto “‘commence proceedings’ against them falls squarely within § 1252(g)—indeed, as we have \ndiscussed, the language seems to have been crafted with such a challenge precisely in mind—and \nnothing elsewhere in § 1252 provides for jurisdiction.”  Id. at 487.  \n  Plaintiffs cannot bypass section 1252(g) simply because they raise a statutory interpretation \nquestion as to DHS’s authority to apply expedited removal to paroled aliens or a constitutional \nchallenge to the expedited removal procedures, just as the AADC Plaintiffs could not bypass \nsection 1252(g) by alleging selective enforcement constitutional claims.  Id.  Indeed, such an \noutcome “would gut § 1252(g)” because “[f]uture petitioners could restyle any challenge to the \n[covered] actions . . . as a challenge to the Executive’s general lack of authority to violate due \nprocess, equal protection, the [Administrative Procedure Act], or some other federal law.”  Tazu, \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 38 of 55\n     \n \n975 F.3d at 298; see also E.F.L., 986 F.3d at 964 (noting that the restyling of claims would make \n§  1252(g) a “paper tiger”).  For these reasons, section 1252(g) bars the Court from enjoining DHS \nfrom applying expedited removal to Plaintiffs’ members. \n3.  Plaintiffs’  Request  for  Injunctive Relief  is  Prohibited  by 8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(f)(1) \nThe Court is further precluded by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) from issuing non-individual \ninjunctive relief restraining the inspection, apprehension, examination, exclusion, and removal of \naliens—the type of relief Plaintiffs request.  Section 1252(f)(1) provides that \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or \nparties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of Part \nIV of this subchapter . . .  other than with respect to the application of such \nprovisions to an individual alien against whom proceedings . . . have been initiated. \n \nSee also Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 797 (2022) (Section 1252(f)(1) “generally prohibits lower \ncourts from entering injunctions that order federal officials to take or to refrain from taking actions \nto enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified statutory provisions”).  “Part IV of this \nsubchapter” refers to 8 U.S.C. §§ 1221-1232, the sections of the United States Code which govern \nthe inspection, apprehension, examination, exclusion, and removal of aliens.  Garland v. Aleman-\nGonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 549, 558 (2022).  “[T]he operation of [§§ 1221-1232] is best understood \nto refer to the Government’s efforts to enhance or implement them”—“a reference not just to the \nstatute itself but to the way that [it is] being carried out.”  Id. at 555 (internal citations omitted).   \nPlaintiffs seek to “enjoin Defendants from applying expedited removal to noncitizens who \nhave previously been granted parole at a port of entry.”  Compl., Prayer for Relief, at ¶ 4.  \nExpedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) falls within §§ 1221-1232 and, therefore, is \ncovered by 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1).  Consequently, the Court lacks authority to grant Plaintiffs’ \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 39 of 55\n     \n \nrequest to categorically enjoin “the Government’s efforts to enforce or implement” section \n1225(b)(1)(A) as to “noncitizens who have previously been granted parole at a port of entry.”12  \nCompare Texas, 597 U.S. at 794, 797 (holding that the district  court’s order enjoining the \ngovernment to continue applying its “remain in Mexico” program under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(2)(C) \nviolated § 1252(f)(1)), with O.A. v. Trump, 404 F. Supp. 3d 109, 158 (D.D.C. 2019) (holding that \n§ 1252(f)(1) did not apply because plaintiffs sought to enjoin ineligibility grounds for asylum under \n8 U.S.C. § 1158, and not a provision within §§ 1221-1232); Gonzalez v. ICE, 975 F.3d 788, 814 \n(9th Cir. 2020) (holding 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) did not apply because plaintiffs sought to enjoin \ndetainers under 8 U.S.C. § 1357(d), and not a provision within §§ 1221-1232).  Enjoining the \noperation of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) is barred even if the Court ultimately determines the agency’s \napplication of expedited removal to former parolees is an “unlawful” or “improper” function of \nthe statute.  Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. at 552-54.  That is, “the reach of § 1252(f)(1)” is not \n“dependent upon the merits” of Plaintiffs’ claim that the government is “misapplying a covered \nstatutory provision,” here § 1225(b)(1)(A), to former parolees.   Id. at 553-54.   In short, a \ncategorical injunction here is simply not an available remedy.  See Texas, 597 U.S. at 798.  And it \nis especially unwarranted here where Plaintiffs are multiple organizations and, moreover, have not \npointed to any member of their organization against whom expedited removal has “been initiated” \n(underscoring their lack of associational standing, see Section I.A).  See Aleman Gonzalez, 596 \n \n12 It remains the government’s view that section 1252(f)(1) can also bar declaratory relief.  See \nAleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. at 551 n.2; cf. California v. Grace Brethren Church, 457 U.S. 393, 408 \n(1982) (Tax Injunction act barred declaratory relief as well as injunctive relief); Newdow v. \nRoberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1012 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  The government recognizes, however, that the \nD.C. Circuit has held otherwise in an opinion pre-dating Aleman Gonzalez. Make The Road N.Y. \nv. Wolf, 962 F.3d 612, 635 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 40 of 55\n     \n \nU.S. at 564 (“In drafting § 1252(f)(1), Congress had every reason to be doubly sure that only \nindividuals in removal proceedings and not other entities,” such as “organizations” and “States,” \n“would receive injunctive relief restraining the operation of the specified provisions of the INA”) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring) (internal citations omitted).13  Thus, Plaintiffs’ request for injunctive \nrelief should be denied on this additional threshold ground. \nC.  Plaintiff Organizations Cannot Show They are Within the Zone of \nInterests Protected by the Expedited Removal Statute \nEven if the Plaintiffs passed the threshold of Article III standing, and even if they showed \nthey were making a timely challenge under § 1252(e)(3) that is not barred by subsections (f) or \n(g), they cannot succeed in asserting violations of the INA.  None of the Plaintiffs are natural \npersons subject to or potentially subject to expedited removal from the United States.  The Plaintiff \norganizations describe their reason for being, e.g., Compl., ¶¶ 61, 75, 76, 88-89, 90, 100, but do \n \n13 Even apart from section 1252(f)(1)’s prohibition, Plaintiffs are not entitled to the vastly \noverbroad injunctive relief they seek.  Plaintiffs ask the Court to enjoin Defendants from initiating \nexpedited removal against a huge number of aliens—all “noncitizens who have been previously \ngranted parole at a port of entry.”  Prayer for Relief, at ¶ 4; 90 Fed. Reg. at 13618 (noting that \n“between October 19, 2022, and January 22, 2025, approximately 532,000 inadmissible aliens \nreceived parole into the United States pursuant to the CHNV parole programs”).  But they have no \nbasis to request such broad relief benefiting non-parties; any injunctive relief should be limited to \nmembers that Plaintiffs can identify to the Court.  See Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 73 (2018) (“A \nPlaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s particular injury.”).  It is also important \nto note that Plaintiffs have not sought to certify a class under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 23; nor could they \nin light of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(f)(1) and 1252(e)(1)(B), the latter which precludes the Court from \ncertifying a class “in any action for which judicial review is authorized” under section 1252(e)(3).   \nAm. Immigr. Laws. Ass’n, 199 F.3d at 1359; see also Monsanto Co. v. Geertson Seed Farms, 561 \nU.S. 139, 163 (2010) (noting that where Plaintiffs “do not represent a class, [] they could not seek \nto enjoin such an order on the ground that it might cause harm to other parties”).  Here, the \nexcessive relief Plaintiffs request would, if granted, enjoin DHS from applying expedited removal \nto potentially hundreds of thousands of paroled aliens whose parole DHS is seeking to revoke, \nthereby frustrating DHS’s efforts to expeditiously remove aliens who are unlawfully in the country \nand imposing substantial administrative burdens by requiring DHS to initiate and litigate full-\nblown removal hearings.   \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 41 of 55\n     \n \nnot show that Congress created a cause of action allowing them to enforce the limits established \nby Congress in the INA or, in particular, the expedited removal statute.  See AILA, 199 F.3d at 1358 \n(“We  cannot see  anything in  these  provisions allowing litigants—whether individuals  or \norganizations—to raise claims on behalf of those not party to the lawsuit.”); id. at 1359 (“When \nwe examine other subsections of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e) dealing with judicial review, we find signs \nthat Congress meant to allow actions only by aliens who have been subjected to the summary \nprocedures contained in § 1225(b) and its implementing regulations.”). \nA plaintiff must be “adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning \nof a relevant statute” to sue under the APA.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  A plaintiff “may not sue unless he \nfalls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation \nforms the legal basis for his complaint.”  Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, 562 U.S. 170, 177 (2011).  \nThis inquiry asks whether Congress intended for a particular plaintiff to invoke a particular statute \nto challenge agency action.  See Clarke v. Security Indus. Ass’n, 479 U.S. 388, 399 (1987).  \nPlaintiffs do not even articulate how they are in the zone of interests of the expedited removal \nstatute.  See Compl., ¶¶ 10-12, 17-19, 59-100.   \nFurthermore, nothing  in  the  text,  structure,  or  purpose of  the  INA  generally,  or \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A) specifically, shows an intent to allow organizational Plaintiffs to challenge agency \naction.  With respect to expedited removal, neither section 1225 nor section 1252 evinces any \nconcern with organizations or their interest in representing individuals subject to expedited \nremoval.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A); see also id. § 1252(e)(1)(B) (limiting class certification \nfor matters subject to judicial review in subsection (e) of the section).  These provisions do not \nregulate the organizational Plaintiffs’ conduct or create any benefits for which the organizations \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 42 of 55\n     \n \nmay be eligible.  For example, section 1252(e)(3) is a jurisdiction-conferring statute and does not \n“provid[e] plaintiffs with a cause of action to challenge the government’s implementation of the \nexpedited removal system.”  Make the Road N.Y. v. McAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1, 36 (D.D.C. \n2019); see also O.A, 404 F. Supp. 3d at 140 (finding no “feature of § 1252(e)(3) suggesting that it \nprovides a cause of action, much less an exclusive cause of action for claims brought challenging \nimplementation of the expedited removal statute”).  And the D.C. Circuit has concluded that \nimmigration statutes are directed at aliens, not organizations advocating for them.  AILA, 199 F.3d \nat 1364 (“[P]laintiff organizations do not have standing to raise claims, whether statutory or \nconstitutional, on behalf of aliens subjected to IIRIRA’s expedited removal system.”); see Fed’n \nfor Am. Immigration Reform, Inc. v. Reno, 93 F.3d 897, 900-04 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (affirming the \ndistrict court’s dismissal of the complaint, reasoning Congress did not “seek to protect the interests \nof the Federation’s members by intending them as beneficiaries or as suitable challengers of \nviolations”). \nAllowing third parties who cannot be subject to expedited removal to challenge the \nExecutive Branch’s decisions through the APA would circumvent Congress’s statutory design.  As \nJustice O’Connor explained in granting the government’s stay application in an immigration case \ninvolving similar organizational plaintiffs, organizations that “provide legal help to immigrants” \ndo not satisfy the zone-of-interests test.  INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of L.A. Cty. Fed’n \nof Labor, 510 U.S. 1301, 1302 (1993) (O’Connor, J., in chambers).  Federal immigration law was \n“clearly meant to protect the interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations.”  \nId. at 1305.  The fact that an immigration regulation “may affect the way an organization allocates \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 43 of 55\n     \n \nits resources” for representing aliens accordingly does not bring the organization “within the zone \nof interests” that the asylum and withholding statutes protect.  Id.   \nDefendants acknowledge that some courts in this District have sometimes held that the \nzone-of-interests test should be applied permissively and have found organizations satisfy it, even \nin the context of the INA.  See, e.g., O.A., 404 F. Supp. 3d at 144.  However, this relaxed standard \ndoes not (and cannot) survive the Supreme Court’s United States v. Texas decision.  599 U.S. 670.  \nThere, the Court clarified—relying on principles that inform the scope of Article III and the APA’s \ncause of action—that third parties have no cognizable interest in the way the Executive enforces \nthe immigration laws against others.  599 U.S. at 674, 677; see also Sure-Tan, Inc. v. NLRB, 467 \nU.S. 883, 897 (1984) (“[P]rivate persons such as petitioners have no judicially cognizable interest \nin procuring enforcement of the immigration laws[.]”).  Thus, for this reason as well, the Court \nshould dismiss Plaintiffs’ statutory claims.  \nII.  On the Merits, Plaintiffs Fail to Establish that Application of Expedited Removal to \nTheir Members Would Violate the INA, APA, or Due Process  \nA.  Aliens Paroled into the U.S. at a Port of Entry are Properly Subject to \nExpedited Removal \n1.  Paroled aliens fall within the category of aliens “arriving in the United \nStates” \nAn alien paroled at the border is subject to expedited removal because he retains his status \nas an “arriving alien” under the INA. The statute provides that aliens arriving in the United States \nwho meet the other requirements (i.e., inadmissibility on fraud and lack-of-documents grounds) \nare subject to expedited removal.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b).  Indeed, an \nalien reverts to the status he possessed prior to the grant of parole which, in the case of all those \nparoled at a port of entry, is that of an applicant for admission standing at the threshold of entry. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 44 of 55\n     \n \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).  As Congress explained, parole “shall not be regarded as an \nadmission of the alien and when the purposes of such parole shall ... have been served the alien \nshall forthwith return ... to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall \ncontinue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the \nUnited States.”  Id.; see Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 288 (2018) (same) (citing statute); \nLeng May Ma, 357 U.S. at 188-90; Ibragimov, 476 F.3d at 137. \nThe long-extant parole regulations confirm what Congress made clear—that an individual \nparoled continues to be considered an arriving alien.  The governing regulations define arriving \nalien to include “an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the United States \nat a port-of-entry.”  8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2, 1001.1(q).  “An arriving alien remains an arriving alien even \nif paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act [8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)], and even after any such \nparole is terminated or revoked.”  8 C.F.R. § 1.2.  Moreover, the qualifications made to the \nregulatory definition—that it does not cover aliens paroled before a particular date or aliens paroled \nafter that date if particular circumstances exist—highlights that it does include the group of aliens \nparoled at a port of entry.  Id.  Moreover, the definition of arriving alien does not include any \ntemporal limit to those who could be subject to expedited removal.  See id.   \nPlaintiffs cite various subregulatory language in an attempt to contradict these clear \nstatutory and regulatory rules, but that effort must fail, in light of this plain statutory and regulatory \nlanguage.  Cf. Philip Morris USA Inc. v. U.S. FDA, 202 F. Supp. 3d 31, 50 (D.D.C. 2016) (holding \nthat agency guidance was inconsistent with plain text of statute).  The March 2025 FRN, which \ndiscusses the designation of those subject to expedited removal in such a way as to also encompass \ncertain parolees, does not change that conclusion.  See 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,611; see also 8 U.S.C. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 45 of 55\n     \n \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Instead, reference to the designation provision only adds to the potential \nsources of authority for subjecting parolees to the expedited removal statute.  It does not diminish \nor alter the unambiguous regulatory provision treating a parolee as an arriving alien (8 C.F.R. § \n1.2) or Congress’s unambiguous command that when parole ends “thereafter his case shall \ncontinue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A).14   \nPlaintiffs also erroneously rely on language in the FRN which states:  “Expedited removal \nis available only when an alien has not been continuously present in the United States for at least \nthe two years preceding the date of the inadmissibility determination.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 13,619 \n(citing the designation provision); see also id. at 13,620 (if parole were allowed to expire on its \nown terms, “CHNV parolees may begin to accrue more than two years of continuous presence in \nthe United States, such that DHS would have to initiate section 240 removal proceedings to \neffectuate their removal.”) (same citation).  Plaintiffs seize on these statements to argue that DHS’s \nreliance on the designation provision in the FRN is inconsistent with its guidance documents.  \nCompl., ¶ 109.  But Plaintiffs’ argument fails because the regulation is relying on an additional \nsource of authority for applying expedited removal— the designation authority—not changing the \nstatutory or regulatory basis for treating parolees as arriving aliens.  In turn, nothing requires an \n \n14 Plaintiffs assert that their members “have begun establishing their lives here” and therefore are \n“no longer in the act of ‘arriving.’”  Compl., ¶ 105.  But they cite no authority for that theory, \nwhich directly contradicts Congress’s direction that a parolee reverts to the status as an applicant \nfor admission once parole ends.  And the expedited removal statute indicates the opposite:  Section \n1252(e)(2) anticipates that even aliens “admitted for permanent residence” or as refugees/asylees \nmay be placed in expedited removal if their status is terminated.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2). \n \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 46 of 55\n     \n \nagency  to  use  one  source  of  legal  authority  over  another  (i.e.,  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)  vs. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)), and this type of policy choice is within the unreviewable discretion of the \nagency.  Here, while DHS cited its designation authority under § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), nothing in the \nFRN precludes it from exercising the full scope of its statutory authority for expedited removal, \nincluding 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), pursuant to implementing regulations that have been in \neffect for over 25 years.    \nMoreover, Plaintiffs ignore the context of the statements in the FRN.  The FRN did not set \nout to decide which individuals would be eligible for expedited removal.  See id. at 13,611 \n(summary and background).  Instead, in issuing this FRN, the Secretary decided to end certain \nparole programs (an action that Plaintiffs do not challenge) and explained her reasons for doing \nso.  Id. at 13,612-17.  One risk—as evidenced by this litigation—was that allowing parole to \ncontinue without prompt termination would raise practical and legal barriers to expedited removal \nthat included a risk that full removal proceedings would be needed.  Id. at 13,619-20.  One need \nonly read the statements in this complaint to understand the legitimacy of the Secretary’s concern \nthat removal would become more difficult if parole were let to run its course.  See Comp. ¶ 105.  \nBeyond that, the Secretary did not purport to alter the clear statutory and regulatory rules that treat \nparolees as arriving aliens.  Even Supreme Court opinions are not to be parsed like a statute, Nat’l \nPork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 373-74 (2023), or to be read as controlling beyond \nthe facts presented, Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 278 (2023), and the \nSecretary’s decision to assess the risks of continued parole programs on the burden of removal \nobviously did not purport to reduce the removal options once parole was rescinded.  In short, the \nregulation that defines arriving alien remains in place and individuals who meet that definition and \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 47 of 55\n     \n \nare inadmissible on the specified grounds are subject to expedited removal without regard to \nwhether they previously were granted parole or the length of their presence in the United States.  \nThe district court’s decision in Svitlana Doe v. Noem, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL \n1099602 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025), appeal pending, No. 25-1384 (1st Cir. filed April 18, 2025), \ndoes not advance Plaintiffs’ position.  There, the district court stayed the FRN’s revocation of \nparole for aliens of certain countries to the extent parole was revoked “without case-by-case \nreview.”  Id. at *20.  The court found plaintiffs were likely to prevail on their claim of legal error \nin DHS’s rationale for immediately terminating parole for individuals already present in the U.S. \nbased on the FRN’s invocation of the designation provision.  Id. at *16-18.    \nThat case offers no support for Plaintiffs’ position.  First, the Supreme Court, by a 7-2 \nmargin, recently granted the Government’s application to stay the district court’s order in \nSvitlana Doe pending its appeal to the First Circuit.  Noem v. Doe, -- S. Ct. --, 2025 WL 1534782 \n(May 30, 2025).  And notably, not even the dissenting Justices defended the district court’s stay \nbased on the likelihood-of-success factor but focused on irreparable harm and the balance of \nequities.  Id. at *1-4; id. at *1 (“Even if the Government is likely to win on the merits, in our \nlegal system, success takes time and the stay standards require more than anticipated victory.”) \n(Jackson, J., dissenting).  In any event, the question of DHS’s authority to apply expedited \nremoval to paroled aliens was not squarely before the district court and could not have been \ngiven the expedited removal statute’s jurisdictional limitations.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A), \n(e)(3) (venue over systematic challenges is proper only in the D.C.); see supra, Section I.B.1.15   \n \n15 To the extent there are statements in the Svitlana Doe decision suggesting there is no authority \n \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 48 of 55\n     \n \n2.  Paroled  aliens  may  be  subject  to  expedited  removal  under  the \ndesignation provision \nEven apart from the arriving alien definition, aliens paroled at a port of entry are subject  \nto expedited removal under the designation provision at 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii), which \nallows designation of an alien “who has not been admitted or paroled” and who cannot show they \nhave been present in the U.S. continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior to the date of \ntheir determination of inadmissibility.  Plaintiffs rely on the “who has not been admitted or \nparoled” language to argue that aliens paroled at a port of entry cannot be designated for expedited \nremoval.  Compl., ¶ 106.  Not so.  Aliens who were (as a historical matter) paroled into the U.S. at \na port of entry can be designated for expedited removal in the future because parole can expire or \nbe terminated.  8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); see 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2) (termination by service \nof charging document).  The use of the present perfect tense (“has not been ... paroled”) here \nreflects a “state that continues into the present.”  See Turner v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 130 F.4th 1254, \n \nunder any statutory provision allowing DHS to apply expedited removal to aliens paroled at ports \nof entry, see Svitlana Doe, 2025 WL 1099602, at *16, those statements are simply wrong, and the \nSupreme Court’s grant of a stay implicitly supports that view.  See id. at *16.  There is no provision \nin any statute or regulation providing that someone “authorized to enter the United States” is not \neligible for expedited removal.  See id.  On the contrary, with respect to the definition of arriving \nalien, an alien paroled at a port of entry is authorized to physically enter the United States.  That \nis, after all, what parole does.  8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A) (“parole into the United States”).  But \nsuch an alien remains in the position of an applicant for admission, id. (“thereafter his case shall \ncontinue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission”), and in \nthe position of an “arriving alien” subject to expedited removal, 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2, 1001.1(q) (“An \narriving alien remains an arriving alien even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act, \nand even after any such parole is terminated or revoked.”).  Indeed, the district court’s statement \nthat expedited removal does not apply to those “authorized to enter the United States” is squarely \nat odds with Congress’s enactment of statutory provisions that anticipate that even an alien who \nwas initially “admitted for permanent residence” or “as a refugee” may be placed in expedited \nremoval if “such status” has “been terminated.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2).  The Svitlana Doe Court \ndid not address these statutory or regulatory provisions. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 49 of 55\n     \n \n1261–62 (11th Cir. 2025) (construing former 8 U.S.C. § 1432 and explaining that the present \nperfect tense can “refer to a . . . state that continues into the present”).  The simpler explanation \nfor this language is Congress’s recognition that a person would not be subjected to expedited \nremoval pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) during the period for which they were \ndesignated for parole. \nThis textual interpretation comports with the statutory and historical context: when parole \nis revoked, an alien reverts to the status he possessed prior to the grant of parole which, in the case \nof all those paroled at a port of entry, is that of an applicant for admission standing at the threshold \nof entry.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A); Jennings, 583 U.S. at 288 (“[W]hen the purpose of the \nparole has been served, the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which \nhe was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that \nof any other applicant for admission to the United States.”) (cleaned up); Leng May Ma, 357 U.S. \nat 188-90; Ibragimov, 476 F.3d at 137.16 \nIn sum, the import of the statutory language—“who has not been admitted or paroled”—is \nbest understood as encompassing aliens who are no longer paroled.  So long as an alien retains \nparole status, he cannot be numbered among those designated for expedited removal under 8 \n \n16 For these reasons, the district court in Svitlana Doe misread the designation provision by \ninterpreting the “who had not been admitted or paroled” language to mean that any alien who has \never been paroled, for any length of time, is categorically immune from expedited removal.  That \nreading is not only contrary to the text and structure of the parole statute and inconsistent with \nthe broader statutory and historical context of parole, it is also inconsistent with longstanding \nregulations which provide that after parole is terminated, “further inspection or hearing shall be \nconducted under section 235 or 240 of the Act.”  8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i).  Section 235 of the \nAct is 8 U.S.C. § 1225, which includes the expedited removal provision. \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 50 of 55\n     \n \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  But once parole is terminated or expired then—so long as he has not \nbeen present for two years—there is no obstacle to his being designated for expedited removal.    \nB.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claim Fails Because the Documents They Contest Did Not \nMake the Changes That Plaintiffs Allege and Are Not Inconsistent \nIn their Second Claim for Relief, Plaintiffs raise an APA claim alleging that three DHS \ndocuments—the Huffman Memo, the February “directive,” and the March 2025 FRN—are \ninconsistent and that through these documents DHS made substantive policy changes without \nconsidering the impact on the affected population.  Compl., ¶¶ 109-11.  Plaintiffs misread these \ndocuments.   The documents provide guidance to immigration officers with regard to the exercise \nof their prosecutorial discretion in selecting which INA procedures to use to process removable \naliens—a decision that itself is not subject to judicial review, see supra at Section I.B.2 (discussing \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g); AADC, 525 U.S. at 487).  \nAs noted above, a long-standing DHS regulation provides that “[a]n arriving alien remains \nsuch even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act,” and therefore is subject to expedited \nremoval.  8 C.F.R. § 1.2.   None of the three documents change this rule or purport to make any \nchanges in rules governing (1) which aliens are designated within the statutory limit, (2) whether \nthe groups of arriving aliens and the group of designated aliens are subject to expedited removal, \nor (3) whether aliens paroled at a port of entry fall into either of those groups.17   \n \n17 For this reason, Plaintiffs’ claims also fail on the ground that there is no “final agency action.”  \n5 U.S.C. § 704.  The APA’s definition of “action” is “not so all-encompassing as to authorize \n[courts] to exercise judicial review [over] everything done by an administrative agency,” Indep. \nEquip. Dealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (Roberts, J.), but is limited to the \nset of “circumscribed, discrete agency actions” delineated in 5 U.S.C. § 551(13), which defines \n“action” as “an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or \n \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 51 of 55\n     \n \nThe Huffman Memo “provides guidance regarding how to exercise enforcement discretion \nin implementing” two separate policies that Plaintiffs do not contest.  Huffman Memo at 1-2.  For \n“any alien . . . amenable to expedited removal but to whom expedited removal has not been \napplied,” the Memo simply directs relevant officials “to review the alien’s case and consider, in \nexercising your enforcement discretion, whether to apply expedited removal.”  Id.  This guidance \nis  entirely  consistent with  the  February 18, 2025 ICE  “directive” which similarly  directs \nenforcement officers to “consider for expedited removal (ER) all aliens previously released by \nU.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) who have not affirmatively filed an application for \nasylum with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.”  Id. (emphasis added).  The directive \nthen summarizes without change legal principles governing the application of expedited removal \nto various groups of aliens.    \nThe March 2025 FRN has a different purpose from the two documents discussed above.  It \ndid not intend to provide general guidance on how immigration officials should exercise their \nenforcement discretion, including the use of expedited removal.   Rather, it  announced the \ntermination of specific parole programs and that individuals paroled under those programs and in \nthe United States would have their parole terminated prior to the natural expiration of the grant.  \n90 Fed. Reg. at 13,612-17, 13,619-20.  DHS’s determination that the relatively higher burden and \ncost to remove someone using removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a than employing \n \nfailure to act.”  See Norton v. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  Here, none of the \ncontested documents definitively address the issue Plaintiffs raise, which, as discussed, is governed \nby an implementing regulation in 1997.  The 2025 FRN makes a policy change by terminating \ncertain parole programs not contested in this case, and the other two DHS documents simply \nremind immigration officers—in the context of aliens whose parole has been revoked—of their \nenforcement discretion in choosing whether or not to initiate removal proceedings, and, if so, in \ndetermining what type of proceeding to apply. \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 52 of 55\n     \n \nexpedited removal is not inconsistent with either the Huffman Memo or the February 18 document \nPlaintiffs rely on.  And DHS’s statements in the March 2025 FRN about being limited to a two-\nyear time period simply do not constitute a renunciation of the availability of using expedited \nremoval against arriving aliens who qualify, which would be contrary to a governing regulation.  \nAccordingly, there is no basis for any claim of inconsistency.   \nFinally, Plaintiffs charge that the agency’s actions violate the APA because they fail to \nconsider the impact of their “changes” on an affected population.  Compl., ¶ 111.  However, as \ndiscussed above, the challenged documents made no policy change with regard to the application \nof expedited removal when they instructed immigration officers of their well-established authority \nto consider which removal procedure should be utilized in the individual case.  The Court cannot \nreview the agency’s decision to adopt policies directing that discretion, and because there has been \nno change in policy, Plaintiffs cannot establish that any reliance interests have been upset.    \nC.  Plaintiffs’ Due Process Claim Lacks Merit and Should be Dismissed  \nPlaintiffs also allege that aliens who are at risk of being subjected to expedited removal are \nentitled to “notice, an opportunity to be heard, and to have the law correctly applied in their cases, \nincluding a meaningful process before they can be removed from the country.”  Compl., ¶ 114.  \nAlthough unclear, it appears Plaintiffs implicitly challenge the adequacy of the expedited removal \nprocedures as applied to aliens paroled at a port of entry.  Id.; see also id., ¶ 84 (claiming “flaws \nin the credible fear screening process”).  But, as discussed above, that challenge is untimely \nbecause under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B), it had to have been raised in this Court within sixty days \nof the date that the expedited removal statute was “first implemented.”   \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 20     Filed 05/30/25     Page 53 of 55\n     \n \nIn any event, Plaintiffs’ challenge is without merit.  The sufficiency of the expedited \nremoval procedures was upheld long ago in AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 54-56.  Plaintiffs fail to explain \nhow the ICE memos and the FRN affect the adequacy of these procedures.  See Compl., ¶¶ 114-\n15.  Plaintiffs are entitled to all the process set forth in the expedited removal statute and \nregulations, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b),18 and that is sufficient to satisfy due \nprocess.  AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 54-56; United States ex rel. Knauff v. Shaughnessy, 338 U.S. 537, \n544 (1950) (“Whatever the procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far as an alien \ndenied entry is concerned”); accord Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. at 138-39; see also Mezei, 345 U.S. \nat 215 (“aliens who arrive at ports of entry—even those paroled elsewhere in the country for years \npending removal—are treated for due process purposes as if stopped at the border”) (cleaned up).   \n   \n \n18 This includes the opportunity to express a fear of persecution or torture and to apply for asylum, \nwithholding of removal, and protection under CAT if the alien can establish a “credible fear” of \npersecution  or  torture  before  a  USCIS  officer  or  an  Immigration  Judge.    8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4).  Under these procedures, the inspecting officer provides \nthe  alien with  Form  M-444, “Information About Credible Fear  Interview.”   See 8  C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(4)(i).   Form M-444 discusses among other things the alien’s statutory rights to \nconsultation and to Immigration Judge review and the consequences of failure to establish a \ncredible fear of persecution or torture.  8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4)(i).  An alien referred for a credible \nfear interview is also given a list of pro bono representatives whom he or she might contact, along \nwith access to a telephone.  “Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens,” 62 Fed.

This  lawsuit  challenges  the  Trump  administration’s  various  agency  policies \nexpanding expedited removal to expose hundreds of thousands of people who entered the country \nlegally through humanitarian parole processes to summary deportation. \n2.  Expedited removal is an extraordinary procedure that allows removal from the \nUnited States with little to no due process. While expedited removal has historically been used \nonly for people in the process of seeking admission at a port of entry or for people encountered in \nthe country a short time after entry and within 100 miles of a land border who had “not been \nadmitted or paroled into the United States,” on January 21, the administration decided to expand \nthe scope of expedited removal to include individuals throughout the United States who have been \ncontinuously present here for less than two years. \n3.  On January 23, the administration issued a memorandum implementing the above \nexpansion of expedited removal by directing agency personnel to consider using the fast-track \nremoval authority on any noncitizen eligible for processing through expedited removal, including \nindividuals who had previously been granted parole. \n4.  Shortly  thereafter,  on  February  18,  the  administration  issued  a  directive  that \npurports to expose individuals paroled into the country at ports of entry to the threat of expedited \nremoval with “no time limit on the ability to process such aliens for ER [expedited removal].” \n5.  The administration also issued a series of commands, both public and private, \nterminating  various  humanitarian  parole  programs,  under  which  hundreds  of  thousands  of \nindividuals fleeing turmoil in their own countries have been lawfully allowed to enter the country \nfor periods typically of two years to attempt to rebuild their lives. The administration additionally \nended the use of CBP One, a mobile application, which allowed certain individuals outside the \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 3 of 35\n \ncountry to schedule appointments to appear at certain land ports of entry to be inspected and \nconsidered for parole. Many CBP One parolees were also placed in ordinary removal proceedings. \nAll of these paroled individuals have been able to apply for work authorization and, when eligible, \nfor immigration benefits, such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”), or other forms of \nrelief, and in some circumstances could re-apply for another period of parole. \n6.  On March 21, the administration posted for public inspection a Federal Register \nnotice that would upon publication formally terminate four such parole processes for nationals of \nCuba,  Haiti.  Nicaragua,  and Venezuela  (the  “CHNV”  parole  processes).  In  this  notice,  the \nadministration again discusses the application of expedited removal to these parolees, but observes \nthat expedited removal only can be used with respect to individuals who have been continuously \npresent in the country for less than two years. The March 21 notice is inconsistent with the \nFebruary 18 directive not only with respect to whether individuals like CHNV parolees may be \nprocessed for expedited removal without any time limit, but more fundamentally with respect to \nthe legal basis for exposing them to expedited removal at all. \n7.  The simultaneous expansion of expedited removal in various and inconsistent ways \nand the termination of humanitarian parole programs places recipients of parole at risk of being \nuprooted from this country and removed without basic due process rights. \n8.  Without relief from this Court, individuals who have lawfully been granted parole \nand are living and working throughout the United States—many with families—are at constant \nrisk of being arrested, detained, and removed from the country through a process that not only \nlacks basic procedural safeguards (like judicial review), but that cannot even be applied to them \nlegally. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 4 of 35\n \n9.  Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”), UndocuBlack \nNetwork  (“UndocuBlack”),  and  CASA,  Inc.  (“CASA”)  are  nonprofit,  membership-based, \nimmigrant rights organizations whose work, services, and programming are guided by their \nmembers. Each group’s members include noncitizens subject to expedited removal under the \npolicies challenged in this litigation.  \n10.  CHIRLA’s members include newly arrived migrant families who fled persecution, \ntorture, and the threat of death, and who sought safety in the United States using the CBP One \nmobile application. Although granted parole and permitted to enter the country temporarily with \nthe opportunity of applying for various forms of protection, these members are now faced with the \npossibility of being sent back to the dangers they fled without notice and a full opportunity to \nsecure relief for which they are eligible. One CHIRLA member, for example, is an Afghan man \nwho fled under fear of execution by the Taliban and attacks by ISIS due to his ethnicity, religion, \nand prior activism. If he is rapidly deported to Afghanistan, he would be in immediate danger of \nbodily injury and death, as well as severe limits to his freedoms of religion, expression, and \nmovement.  \n11.  UndocuBlack’s members include Black migrants who were granted parole through \nthe CHNV parole processes or after securing an appointment at a land port of entry through the \nCBP One mobile application. Since their entry into the country, these members have been targeted \nconstantly in the United States by anti-Black, anti-Haitian violence, and are plagued by the \nconstant fear of losing their parole and being subjected to rapid deportation back to persecution \nand danger in Haiti. One of these members, a Haitian man who fled political persecution in his \nhome country, describes feeling now under the administration’s expedited removal directives like \nhe is “one second away from losing everything, including [his] life.”  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 5 of 35\n \n12.  CASA’s members include both individuals who were sponsored to come to the \nUnited States through the CHNV parole processes and individuals who came through using the \nCBP One mobile application, and they are experiencing widespread anxiety, fear, and confusion \nabout the administration’s new policies on parole and expedited removal. One Venezuelan CASA \nmember was granted TPS after he came to the United States on CHNV parole, but because of the \nadministration’s termination of Venezuelan TPS and expansion of expedited removal to apply to \nparoled individuals, he is now at risk of soon being subjected to expedited removal and separated \nfrom his young child.  \n13.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the application of expedited removal under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) to individuals like their members who have previously been granted parole \nat a port of entry is unlawful; an injunction prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”) from continuing to apply its unlawful construction of the statute to expose individuals \nwho have previously been granted parole at a port of entry to the threat of expedited removal; and \nvacatur of agency actions taken pursuant the agency’s erroneous understanding of the law. \n14.  There are other pending cases challenging (1) the expansion of expedited removal \nto individuals in the interior of the country who have lived here for less than two years and (2) the \ntermination  of  various  humanitarian  parole  programs.  This  case  is  largely  focused  on  the \nintersection of those issues to ensure that people who were previously granted parole at a port of \nentry and have been living here continuously since that time are not subject to summary expulsion \nonce they have been stripped of parole status or their period of parole has expired. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). Section \n1252(e)(3) provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 6 of 35\n \nan action challenging as unlawful “a written policy directive, written policy guidance, or written \nprocedure” implementing the expedited removal statute. This Court additionally has jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n16.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \nSection 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. In addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District and Defendants are \nofficers of the United States being sued in their official capacity and reside in the District. \nPARTIES \n17.  Plaintiff  Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”) is a nonprofit \nmembership organization headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with eight offices throughout \nCalifornia and a national policy office in Washington, D.C.

He was inaugurated on January 20, 2025. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 8 of 35\n \nBACKGROUND \nThe Statutory Parole Authority \n25.  For more than 70 years, the Nation’s immigration laws have granted the Executive \nthe authority to temporarily parole certain noncitizens into the country. Such grants of parole do \nnot constitute an admission into the country, but for the duration of their parole status noncitizens \nmay apply for employment authorization and, in some cases, request that their period of parole be \nextended. Like other noncitizens, parolees can also apply for other forms of immigration relief. \nCertain noncitizens who were inspected and paroled into the country also may apply to adjust their \nstatus to lawful permanent residence. \n26.  From 1952 until 1996, the Attorney General was authorized by statute to grant \nparole “for emergent reasons” or “for reasons deemed strictly in the national interest.” Neither \nphrase was defined by Congress. \n27.  Since 1996, the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) has \nbeen authorized by statute to grant parole for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public \nbenefit.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Again, neither phrase has ever been defined by Congress. \n28.  Humanitarian parole has been a key component of immigration policy since the \nEisenhower administration used it to allow 30,000 Hungarians fleeing Soviet invasion to come to \nthe United States. Parole has been used over 125 times by administrations of both parties—\nincluding the first Trump administration—to promote the national interest by advancing various \nhumanitarian, foreign policy, regional security, and migration management objectives. \nExercises of the Statutory Parole Authority \n29.  In  the  past  two  decades  alone,  various  challenges  associated  with  managing \nmigration throughout the Western Hemisphere and at the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as fallout \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 9 of 35\n \nand displacement resulting from armed conflicts elsewhere in the world, informed decisions by \nDHS to create a variety of processes to facilitate the consideration of individuals for entry into the \nUnited States for a temporary period of time through the statutory parole authority. \n30.  Operation Allies Welcome. When Afghanistan’s military and government quickly \nfell to the Taliban upon the withdrawal of the U.S. military in August 2021, the U.S. government \nevacuated approximately 124,000 people from the country through Operation Allies Welcome. \nAfter  evacuees  went  through  medical,  security,  and  other  screenings  in  third  countries, \napproximately 75,000 were authorized to travel to the United States and were inspected and \nparoled into the country. Fewer than 50,000 Afghans remain in the United States on current grants \nof parole by virtue of OAW.  \n31.  Uniting for Ukraine. In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in \nFebruary 2022, which marked the start of a war that continues to this day, significant numbers of \nUkrainian nationals began presenting at U.S. ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border to request \nhumanitarian protection. Initially, CBP generally paroled these individuals into the country, but in \nthe interest of creating a safe, orderly, and humane pathway for displaced Ukrainian nationals and \ntheir immediate family members in Europe to request entry to the United States, DHS established \nthe Uniting for Ukraine (“U4U”) Parole Process. See Implementation of the Uniting for Ukraine \nParole Process, 87 Fed. Reg. 25040 (Apr. 17, 2022). \n32.  Under U4U, qualifying individuals who passed background and security checks \nand had a financial supporter in the United States would be granted travel authorization to fly to \nthe United States at no expense to the government and present themselves at an interior port of \nentry to be inspected and considered for parole. Approximately 200,000 Ukrainians are in the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 10 of 35\n \nUnited States today by way of parole. Most had preexisting ties to the United States, which is why \nthey came here for refuge when they fled their home country. \n33.  Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan Parole Processes: Faced with a \nmarked increase in the number of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan nationals arriving \nat the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022—and given the difficulties of repatriating CHNV \nnationals to their home countries for a variety of humanitarian and diplomatic reasons—the Biden \nAdministration created for each country a parole process modelled on U4U.  \n34.  In October 2022, DHS established a parole process for certain Venezuelans. See \nImplementation of a Parole Process for Venezuelans, 87 Fed. Reg. 63507 (Oct. 19, 2022). \nApproximately two months later, and in light of the effectiveness of the Venezuelan parole process \nin reducing encounters of Venezuelan nationals between the ports of entry, DHS expanded the \nVenezuelan parole process, see Implementation of Changes to the Parole Process for Venezuelans, \n88 Fed. Reg. 1279 (Jan. 9, 2023), and established similar parole processes for certain Cubans, \nHaitians, and Nicaraguans. See Implementation of a Parole Process for Cubans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1266 \n(Jan. 9, 2023); Implementation of a Parole Process for Haitians, 88 Fed. Reg. 1243 (Jan. 9, 2023); \nImplementation of a Parole Process for Nicaraguans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1255 (Jan. 9, 2023). The Federal \nRegister Notices announcing the CHNV parole processes identified a series of significant public \nbenefits and urgent humanitarian reasons that would be advanced through the use of parole for \nindividuals availing themselves of the processes and additionally connected the implementation of \nthe processes to ongoing foreign relations initiatives aimed at increasing regional cooperation in \nand capacity to effectively and responsibly manage migration throughout the Western Hemisphere. \n35.  Over a half million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans received \nparole through CHNV. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 11 of 35\n \n36.  CBP One: Around the same time that the administration created the CHNV parole \nprocesses, it also made available to migrants in Central and Northern Mexico a mobile application \ncalled CBP One, which could be used to schedule an in-person appointment at one of several land \nports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. Upon receiving an appointment, migrants could \npresent themselves at the port of entry for inspection and be considered for parole into the country. \nTypically, paroled individuals would also be issued a Notice to Appear in immigration court where \nthey would be able to pursue any form of immigration relief for which they might be eligible. \nTogether with the new CHNV parole processes, the CBP One appointment process was designed \nto facilitate safe and orderly processing of migrants at certain land ports of entry to reduce the \nincidence of migrants entering the country without inspection between ports of entry. \n37.  Central American Minors Parole: Central American Minors (CAM) parole was \ncreated in 2014 as part of a broader initiative that also involved the consideration of certain Central \nAmerican minors and qualifying family members for refugee status and potential resettlement in \nthe United States; individuals determined not to be eligible for refugee status were considered, on \na case-by-case basis, for parole into the United States. The CAM Refugee and Parole Program was \nlargely prompted by the significant number of unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle \ncountries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. Under the \nprogram, certain nationals of those countries who are lawfully present in the United States may \nrequest that their children still in their home countries be considered for refugee status and, in the \nalternative, humanitarian parole, so that their families could be safely reunited. In addition to \nfamily reunification, the CAM program was intended to create a lawful and orderly pathway to \ndisincentivize children from making the overland journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition \nto being dangerous and potentially enriching smugglers, unaccompanied children presenting at the \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 12 of 35\n \nborder create unique operational challenges for DHS. CAM parolees in the United States have \nbeen able to apply for and receive re-parole when their initial grants of parole expired. \n38.  Family Reunification Parole Programs: In 2007, DHS created the Cuban Family \nReunification Parole Program to allow certain approved beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions, \nupon invitation by the federal government, to apply to be considered for parole into the United \nStates so that they would not have to wait abroad—sometimes for years—for a visa number to \nbecome available. See Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, 72 Fed. Reg. 65588 (Nov. 21, \n2007). Similar programs were created for Haitian family members in 2014, family members of \nFilipino World War II veterans and their spouses in 2016, and family members from additional \ncountries in Central and South America in 2023. See, e.g. Implementation of Haitian Family \nReunification Parole Program, 79 Fed. Reg. 75581 (Dec. 18, 2014); Filipino World War II Veterans \nParole Policy, 81 Fed. Reg. 28097 (May 9, 2016); Implementation of a Family Reunification Parole \nProcess for Guatemalans, 88 Fed. Reg. 43581 (July 10, 2023). \nSummary Termination of Parole Processes \n39.  On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14165, \n“Securing Our Borders,” that, among other things, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security \n(the “Secretary”) to terminate all so-called “categorical parole program . . . including the program \nknown as the ‘Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.’”  \n40.  That same day, Acting Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman issued a memorandum \nentitled, “Exercising Appropriate Discretion Under Parole Authority,” to the heads of ICE, CBP, \nand USCIS. In that memorandum, Acting Secretary Huffman set out a narrow and legally incorrect \ninterpretation of the parole statute, directed that every action regarding parole henceforth use this \ninterpretation, and authorized pausing and terminating parole programs. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 13 of 35\n \n41.  Also  on  January  20,  Acting  Commissioner  of  CBP  Pete  Flores  issued  a \nmemorandum restricting the CBP personnel authorized to grant parole and requiring that each \nparole granted by any CBP official be reported to him and the Chief of Staff, along with a \njustification for the grant. Acting Commissioner Flores’ memorandum expressly supersedes any \nprior conflicting guidance. \n42.  Further on that day, CBP terminated the ability of noncitizens to use the CBP One \nmobile application to schedule appointments to appear at select land ports of entry for inspection \nand consideration for parole and cancelled existing appointments. \n43.  Later that same week, Acting Director of USCIS Jennifer Higgins issued a directive \nprohibiting USCIS staff from making any further decisions on any request for, among other things, \nparole or re-parole made through the OAW, U4U, CHNV, or other named parole processes. \n44.  On March 21, DHS posted for public inspection a Federal Register Notice that \npurports to formally terminate the CHNV parole processes and to terminate en masse at the end of \na 30-day period all grants of parole issued to individuals pursuant to the CHNV parole processes. \nSee Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, Mar. \n21,  2025,  https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-05128.pdf  (“CHNV  Termination \nNotice”). The termination of parole will have the effect of immediately rendering void employment \nauthorization documents issued to individuals on the basis of the grant of parole and will result in \nthe accrual of unlawful presence for individuals who are not shielded from accruing unlawful \npresence through some other means (e.g., if they have a pending application for asylum, and/or \nhave been granted Temporary Protected Status). The Notice asserts that the federal government \nhas a “strong interest in promptly removing parolees when the basis for the underlying program \nno longer exists,” but notes that “[e]xpedited removal is available only when an alien has not been \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 14 of 35\n \ncontinuously present in the United States for at least the two years preceding the date of the \ninadmissibility determination.” Id. at 27 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(iii)(II); 8 C.F.R. § 235.5).” \nThe Notice further observes that “[i]f DHS were to allow the CHNV parolee population to remain \nfor the full duration of their two-year parole, DHS would be compelled to place a greater \nproportion of this population in section 240 removal proceedings to effectuate their removal.” Id. \nThe Notice is scheduled to be published in the Federal Register on March 25. \n45.  The termination of various humanitarian parole processes is being challenged in \nseparate litigation. See, e.g., Svitlana Doe v. Trump, No. 1:25cv10495 (D. Mass. filed Feb. 28, \n2025) (challenging, among other things, the termination of OAW, U4U, CHNV, and certain other \nparole processes). \nThe Statutory Expedited Removal Authority \n46.  Under our immigration laws and unless otherwise specified, removal proceedings \nconducted  in  immigration  court—with  the  right  to  appellate  review  before  the  Board  of \nImmigration Appeals and federal court review—are the “sole and exclusive procedure” for \ndetermining whether a person should be admitted to or removed from the country. 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a(a)(3). \n47.  One specified exception to full removal proceedings is the expedited removal \nprocess created by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996. Under expedited removal, certain noncitizens determined by an immigration officer to be \n“inadmissible” because they engaged in fraud or misrepresentation to procure admission or other \nimmigration benefits, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or because they lack the requisite documents for \nentry, Section 1187(a)(7), may be ordered removed by that officer “without further hearing or \nreview.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 15 of 35\n \n48.  Individuals processed through expedited removal who express a fear of persecution \nor an intent to apply for asylum are entitled to a credible fear screening interview, see 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1), and are entitled to “further consideration of the application for asylum,” typically \nthrough placement in full removal proceedings, only if they are found to possess the requisite \ncredible fear. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B). \n49.  By statute, the use of expedited removal is authorized for only two categories of \nnoncitizens. First, a noncitizen who “is arriving in the United States” may be processed for \nexpedited removal if they are found to be inadmissible on the grounds described above. See 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n50.  Second, the statute permits the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity) to apply expedited removal to certain other noncitizens found inadmissible on the above \ngrounds who have entered and remain in the United States but who “ha[ve] not been admitted or \nparoled into the United States.” See U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). For expedited removal to be used \nin this way, the Secretary must designate certain noncitizens in the country to whom this so-called \n“expanded expedited removal” may be applied. Expanded expedited removal may not be applied \nto any noncitizen who can prove to the “satisfaction of an immigration officer” that they have been \ncontinuously physically present in the country for two years. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); \n8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(1)(ii), (b)(6). \n51.  On January 21, 2025, Acting Secretary Huffman issued for public inspection and \neffective immediately a designation expanding the scope of expedited removal to apply nationwide \nand to certain noncitizens who are unable to prove they have been in the country continuously for \ntwo years. The designation was published in the Federal Register three days later on January 24, \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 16 of 35\n \n2025. See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8139 (Jan. 24, 2025). \n52.  This expansion of expedited removal is being challenged in separate litigation. See \nMake the Road New York v. Huffman, 25-cv-00190 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 22, 2025). \nApplication of Expedited Removal to Noncitizens Who Have Been Paroled \n53.  On January 23, 2025, Acting Secretary Huffman issued a memorandum entitled, \n“Guidance Regarding How to Exercise Enforcement Discretion,” to the leadership of ICE, CBP, \nand  USCIS.  The  memorandum  describes  the Acting  Secretary’s  January  20  memorandum \nauthorizing the pausing or termination of various parole programs and the January 21 designation \nexpanding the scope of expedited removal—both of which are described above—and “provides \nguidance regarding how to exercise enforcement discretion in implementing these policies.” \n54.  Specifically, the January 23 Huffman memorandum explains that “[t]o effectively \nimplement these two new policies,” agency personnel are directed to consider applying expedited \nremoval to “any alien DHS is aware of who is amenable to expedited removal but to whom \nexpedited removal has not been applied.” The memorandum notes that this may include taking \nsteps to terminate ongoing removal proceedings in immigration courts and/or “active parole \nstatus.” \n55.  For individuals DHS is aware of who do not meet the conditions above but have \n“been granted parole under a policy that may be paused, modified, or terminated immediately \nunder the January 20 memorandum,” the January 23 Huffman memorandum directs that they be \nconsidered for placement in removal proceedings and that the continued appropriateness of their \nparole be reviewed. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 17 of 35\n \n56.  On or about February 18, 2025, a directive was sent by ICE leadership to all \nEnforcement and Removal Operations personnel directing such officers to consider for expedited \nremoval “paroled arriving aliens” who have not applied affirmatively for asylum with USCIS. The \ndirective claims that “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to process such aliens for [expedited \nremoval],” thereby exposing individuals paroled into the United States after inspection at a port of \nentry to the indefinite threat of this fast-track removal process. Although this directive has not been \nofficially released, a copy of the directive was published by Reuters in connection with its reporting \non the impact of the directive. See Ted Hesson and Kristina Cooke, “Trump weighs revoking legal \nstatus  of  Ukrainians  as  US  steps  up  deportations,”  Reuters,  Mar.  6,  2025, \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plans-revoke-legal-status-ukrainians-who-fled-us-\nsources-say-2025-03-06/.  \n57.  The February 18 directive further states that the issuance to the individual of an \nexpedited removal charging document has the effect of terminating that individual’s active parole \nstatus. \n58.  On March 21, DHS posted for inspection the CHNV Termination Notice, which \ndiscusses in multiple places when and under what authority the agency intends to process CHNV \nparolees for expedited removal. The notice states that “[e]xpedited removal is available only when \nan alien has not been continuously present in the United States for at least the two years preceding \nthe  date  of  the  inadmissibility  determination.”  CHNV Termination  Notice  at  27.    Because \n“thousands of CHNV parolees . . . will become ineligible for expedited removal upon the natural \ntermination of their two-year parole,” id. at 29 n.77, and to “initiate expedited removal proceedings \nto the maximum extent possible for the appropriate CHNV population,” id. at 29, the Department \ndecided to terminate grants of parole early rather than allowing individuals the benefit of the two-\n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 18 of 35\n \nyear period they have been granted and made terminations effective 30 days after the publication \ndate rather than at some later date. \nHarm to Plaintiff Organizations and Their Members \n59.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit membership-based organizations whose members include \nindividuals who have been paroled into the United States through some of the humanitarian parole \nprocesses relevant to this case. Defendants’ directives to apply expedited removal to parolees cause \nPlaintiffs’ members substantial injury. \n60.  Plaintiff CHIRLA’s mission is to advance the human and civil rights of immigrants \nand refugees and ensure immigrant communities are fully integrated into society with full rights \nand access to resources. \n61.  In furtherance of this mission, CHIRLA provides a range of services that reach tens \nof thousands of Californians each year. These services include education programs, legal services \nprograms, and an assistance hotline that fields on average 15,000 calls a year. CHIRLA educates \nits membership as well as the broader community through know-your-rights trainings, workshops, \nand social media and educational literature about a variety of social services and benefits, including \nimmigration law, financial literacy, workers’ rights, and civic engagement.  \n62.  CHIRLA serves individuals who were paroled into the country under humanitarian \nparole processes through all of its different programs. In particular, CHIRLA provides trauma-\ninformed wrap-around case management services to newly arrived migrant families who were \nparoled through CBP One and Afghan nationals who arrived through Operation Allies Welcome. \nThese include benefits navigation, employment services, housing search, cultural orientation, pro \nse legal services, and other services needed for newcomers to successfully integrate into their new \ncommunities. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 19 of 35\n \n63.  CHIRLA members play an important role in deciding what CHIRLA’s priorities are \nand how CHIRLA serves the community. CHIRLA receives feedback from its members during an \nannual member meeting and other member convenings where CHIRLA staff meet with members \nto discuss priorities for CHIRLA’s work. \n64.  CHIRLA membership is voluntary, and it is open to anyone who believes in the \nimportance of social justice and supports an immigrant community, and who embodies diversity, \nequality and inclusion. By becoming a CHIRLA member, an individual agrees to take a stand for \nimmigrant rights. \n65.  To become a CHIRLA member, an individual must submit an online application for \nmembership, make an annual dues payment, and agree to the values and mission of CHIRLA. The \ncurrent membership fee for individuals is $25, which can be paid manually every year or by setting \nup an annual recurring payment. There is also a family membership option, which is $60, and an \nenhanced individual membership (called a “community membership”) option, which is $100 and \nprovides select additional benefits. The fee can be (and occasionally has been) waived for \nindividuals who experience financial hardship or are otherwise unable to pay. Once an individual \nbecomes a CHIRLA member, they will receive a membership card and access to CHIRLA legal \nservices and educational resources, year-round events and membership calls, and other benefits.  \n66.  CHIRLA’s membership is diverse and includes U.S. citizens, non-U.S. citizens with \nlawful status, and non-U.S. citizens without lawful status. Members include individuals who were \nparoled into the country through the CBP One application and through the Operation Allies \nWelcome parole process. CHIRLA has serviced hundreds of CBP One parolees, at least a dozen \nof whom have already become CHIRLA members.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 20 of 35\n \n67.  Members include both noncitizens who have been granted parole and have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than two years, as well as those who have been \nhere for two years or more. Some of these parolee members are in active removal proceedings \nalready, and some are not.  \n68.  These parolee members of CHIRLA include many who would be deeply and \nseverely harmed if they were subject to expedited removal. For example, CHIRLA John Doe 1 is \nan Ecuadorian man who was paroled into the United States through CBP One during the latter half \nof 2024 after he fled Ecuador out of fear for his life. After a cartel began extorting him for money, \nthreatening to kill him if he didn’t make regular payments and if he tried to leave town, he felt he \nhad no other option but to flee the country. The cartel told him that if they heard that he was trying \nto sell his possessions and leave town, they would find him and kill him on the spot. CHIRLA John \nDoe 1 was aware of this happening to other people, as extortion was common in the area where he \nlived. Additionally, if he got further involved in the extortion scheme, it was equivalent to joining \nthe cartel. Unable to make payments, and unwilling to resort to a life of crime, CHIRLA Doe 1 left \nhis home, fearing for his life. Expedited removal back to Ecuador would put CHIRLA John Doe 1 \nback at risk of being murdered by the cartel. \n69.  Another CHIRLA member is a Guatemalan woman whose husband was the target \nof death threats back in Guatemala. A man who was the head of a local criminal network and was \nrumored to have murdered at least one other person in the community made verbal threats to their \nfamily, including to their son, and stalked them, hanging around their house at all hours. Before \nthe death threats and stalking, he and members of his network had also harassed the CHIRLA \nmember and her family when they went outside, impeding their ability to move freely. The \nCHIRLA member and her family tried to file reports with the police to obtain help but, as the man \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 21 of 35\n \nwas a former police officer, the police did not get involved. For their safety, she and her family left \ntheir home for the United States and were paroled into the country through CBP One during the \nsummer of 2023. If they were subject to expedited removal, they would be rapidly sent back to the \nsame severe risk of harm, including of death, from which they fled. \n70.  Another CHIRLA member is an Afghan man who was paroled into the United \nStates through CBP One during the summer of 2024. He fled Afghanistan because he is a member \nof a minority community that the Taliban and ISIS systematically target for violence, killings, and \nbombings. He has survived attacks in the past, but the fall of Kabul in August 2021 escalated the \nthreats against him and his community. He is also an activist, so he faces an even higher risk of \npersecution, torture, and even execution in Afghanistan. If he is put into expedited removal \nproceedings and deported to Afghanistan, he would be in immediate danger of kidnapping, torture, \nand death at the hands of the Taliban. He would face severe restrictions on his freedom to exercise \nhis religion, freedom of expression, and freedom of movement. \n71.  CHIRLA members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers and detention \nby ICE are common. ICE actively detains noncitizens all over California, including in and near \nLos Angeles. \n72.  Because of the services that CHIRLA provides to its members, CHIRLA is acutely \naware of the harms that Defendants’ application of expedited removal to parolees will cause to its \nmembers.  \n73.  Parolee clients and members have expressed fears to CHIRLA around their parole \nstatus being revoked and then being subject to expedited removal. Beyond being fearful, CBP One \nparolees also express a sense of betrayal as they followed an established process laid out by the \nU.S. government, with many of them waiting months and in some cases over a year in Mexico—\n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 22 of 35\n \noften in dangerous and difficult settings—for their appointments to appear at a land port of entry \nfor inspection and consideration for parole. OAW Afghan parolees have expressed an even more \nheightened sense of disappointment as many of them risked their lives to support the U.S. military, \nand the government is now turning its back on them. \n74.  Expedited removal of parolees like CHIRLA’s members would be particularly \nharmful because of the rapid, summary nature of the process. It makes it more difficult for \nmembers and their families to have a plan in place; it causes more devastating, sudden family \nseparation, which has a severe impact on any children involved; and the community around the \nmembers suffer as well. Additionally, the rapid deportation process would deprive some CHIRLA \nmembers of the opportunity to submit applications for immigration protections that they are \nentitled to. For those who may be eligible for asylum or Convention Against Torture protections \nin the United States, the credible fear screenings that exists in the expedited removal process—\nwhich depend upon case referrals by enforcement personnel to asylum officers and typically \ninvolve little to no access to counsel—is often badly flawed and result in the removal of people to \nhorrible circumstances abroad. \n75.  In its educational materials and know-your-rights trainings, CHIRLA has been \nteaching members about the risk of detention and deportation, including through expedited \nremoval, and what they can do to prepare themselves and their families for the possibility.   \n76.  Plaintiff  UndocuBlack’s  mission  is  to  foster  community,  facilitate  access  to \nresources, and contribute to transforming the realities of its members – who are Black immigrants \n– so they can thrive and live their fullest lives.   \n77.  UndocuBlack’s community-centered approach aspires to empower members to \nidentify their needs and help shape the trajectory of UndocuBlack’s work. UndocuBlack engages \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 23 of 35\n \nand supports their members and advocates for policies that protect members and Black immigrants \nat  large  through  different  areas  of  work  including  community  engagement  and  organizing, \ncommunity wellness, narrative and storytelling, and policy and advocacy.  \n78.  UndocuBlack serves thousands of immigrants around the country, including in New \nYork, Florida, California, and the greater D.C./Maryland/Virginia area. The largest concentration \nof UndocuBlack’s membership is in New York, where there is an active local chapter.  \n79.  UndocuBlack’s  membership  is  approximately  700  members.  To  become  an \nUndocuBlack member, an individual need only (1) identify as Black, (2) be an immigrant, and (3) \nsubmit a form to indicate their interest in joining the membership. There are no membership dues \nrequired.  \n80.  UndocuBlack has long served and supported the Haitian community in particular. \nPrior to the Trump administration’s termination of humanitarian parole programs, UndocuBlack \nhelped many Haitian members in the United States determine if they were eligible to sponsor \nfamily members for CHNV parole based on their income. UndocuBlack also assisted Haitian \nmembers and their families with school enrollment, getting connected to English Language \nLearner  programs,  applying  for  work  authorizations,  and  completing  applications  for  other \nimmigration benefits like TPS.   \n81.  UndocuBlack has numerous members who are Haitian CHNV and CBP One parole \nbeneficiaries. The Trump administration’s application of expedited removal to parolees directly \nharms these members.  \n82.  Since the administration’s expansion of expedited removal to apply nationwide and \nto certain noncitizens who cannot prove they have been here for two years and the various \ndirectives  that  expose  parolees  to  expedited  removal, UndocuBlack has  received  countless \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 24 of 35\n \ninquiries from its members and the UndocuBlack community at large, including from those with \nparole, regarding what these policies mean and how they will be used to arrest, detain, and \nexpeditiously remove parolees. In response to members’ questions and requests for additional \ninformation, UndocuBlack created a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) resource to share with \nmembers and the broader community. UndocuBlack has also conducted member calls that have \nincluded Know Your Rights (KYR) trainings; such trainings have covered the impact that the \nexpansion of expedited removal will have on parolees and safeguards that parolees should take to \nprotect themselves and their families.  \n83.  Expedited removal of Haitian CHNV and CBP One beneficiaries will severely harm \nUndocuBlack members in many ways. Some UndocuBlack members who are Haitian CHNV \nparolees did not come in time to apply for TPS and even those who now have TPS recognize that \nthe Trump administration is working to terminate those protections early (i.e., by August 3, 2025). \nUndocuBlack’s Haitian CHNV parolees also have family members with different immigration \nstatuses. UndocuBlack expects  that  many  affected  members  will  experience  abrupt  family \nseparation, will lose one or more household incomes, fear sending their children to school, and \nmay be deported to Haiti where they don’t have family or resources, and where they may be at risk \nof violence. \n84.  UndocuBlack members who may be eligible for asylum or Convention Against \nTorture protections in the United States still fear that they could be deported through expedited \nremoval, given the flaws in the credible fear screening process. The screenings depend on case \nreferrals by enforcement personnel to asylum officers, and noncitizens are given little opportunity \nto gather relevant documents, present evidence, or consult counsel. Due to these and other \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 25 of 35\n \ninadequacies, the screenings can result in, and have resulted in, the removal of people to dangerous \ncircumstances abroad.   \n85.  One UndocuBlack member, UBN Jane Doe 1, is a Haitian woman who was \nsponsored to come to the United States through the Haitian CHNV parole process. She applied for \nand was granted TPS, but now, due to the administration’s efforts to terminate Haitian TPS \nprematurely, that status will likely expire in August, and she could be subject to expedited removal.  \nUBN Jane Doe 1’s son, who is back in Haiti, is ill, and being able to work in the U.S. through \nCHNV has been the only way UBN Jane Doe 1 has been able to provide for him. The anticipated \nearly  terminations  of  both TPS  and  parole,  together  with  the  possibility  of  being  removed \nexpeditiously without a meaningful opportunity to request any possible form of relief, have caused \nsignificant harm to UBN Jane Doe 1, who has relied upon CHNV parole to provide for herself and \nher ailing child. Moreover, the government’s betrayal and stripping of time that was given to her—\nwhich would be exacerbated by efforts to quickly remove her without process—will cause deep \nfinancial and psychological harm to her. \n86.  Another UndocuBlack member, UBN Jane Doe 2, is a 45-year-old mother who fled \nHaiti and was paroled into the U.S. with her young son through CBP One in March 2024. As she \nstruggles to navigate the complex asylum process without legal representation, she lives in \nconstant fear for both her life and her child’s. Her greatest terror is that stepping outside for any \nreason could mean never returning to her son. Through free legal resources, she has learned that \nshe must always be prepared to show documentation of at least two years of presence in the U.S. \nBut the harsh reality is that she simply does not have that. The weight of this requirement, coupled \nwith the uncertainty of her status, leaves her paralyzed with fear—afraid to attend her own \nhearings, afraid to send her son to school, and even afraid to stay in her own home. Any knock at \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 26 of 35\n \nthe door or passing shadow, even from the mail carrier, fills her with terror. She lives in a constant \nstate of anxiety, fearing that at any minute, she will be processed for expedited removal, forced to \ntry and quickly defend her asylum claim alone and without the opportunity to see a judge, without \nthe ability to pay for an attorney, and while battling language barriers. \n87.  UndocuBlack members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers and \ndetention by ICE are common. ICE actively detains noncitizens all over New York, where the \nlargest concentration of UndocuBlack members reside. \n88.  UndocuBlack and its members see the expedited removal policies at issue in this \ncase as another anti-Black, anti-Haitian attack in a long line of such discrimination and violence \nby the Trump administration. \n89.  As  an  organization  with  some  undocumented  members  who  are  also  Black, \nUndocuBlack’s  members  will  be  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Trump  administration’s \nexpedited removal expansion. Due to intersectional bias around race and criminality, Black people \nin the United States experience a higher rate of interaction with law enforcement than people of \nother races. This racial bias and profiling coupled with a person’s immigration status and possible \nlanguage barrier will mean that Haitian parolees will be some of the most adversely affected by \nthis expansion. \n90.  Plaintiff CASA’s mission is to create a more just society by building power and \nimproving the quality of life in working-class Black, Latino/a/e, Afro-descendent, Indigenous, and \nimmigrant communities. From its beginnings in a church basement, CASA has envisioned a future \nwith diverse and thriving communities living free from discrimination and fear, working together \nwith mutual respect to achieve human rights for all. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 27 of 35\n \n91.  In furtherance of this mission, CASA offers a wide variety of social, health, job \ntraining, employment, and legal services to immigrant communities, with a particular focus in \nMaryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. CASA also offers a more \nlimited suite of services remotely to members across the United States. Those individuals who do \nnot live in an area with a local CASA organizing committee are offered the opportunity to join a \nnational organizing committee, whose members are entitled to vote on CASA’s organizational \npriorities and are integrated into its member-led system of internal democratic governance. CASA \nalso conducts campaigns to inform members of immigrant communities of their rights and assists \nindividuals in applying for a variety of government benefits. In addition, CASA provides its \nmembers with free remote legal assistance, including free legal consultations and referrals on \nimmigration issues. Capacity permitting, CASA provides legal representation to members in \nremoval defense cases and on affirmative immigration applications to USCIS.   \n92.  A CASA member is a person who shares CASA’s values, envisions a future where \nwe can achieve full human rights for all, and is convinced that, when united and organized, we can \ncreate a more just society by building power in our working-class and immigrant communities. \nCASA members play an important role in deciding what campaigns CASA works on and how \nCASA serves the community. \n93.  CASA membership is voluntary. To become a member, an individual must apply, \npay dues, and subscribe to the principles of CASA. CASA members also must self-identify as \nmembers of an immigrant or working-class community. Currently, the annual fee for CASA \nmembership is $35. Alternatively, individuals may pay a recurring membership fee of $5 per \nmonth. The membership fee can be waived when appropriate. Members are also offered the \nopportunity, for an additional $5, to obtain a CASA ID. This is a physical, picture identification \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 28 of 35\n \ncard that contains basic information about the member. For many of CASA’s immigrant members, \nthis card may be the only type of picture identification they have, other than documents from their \nhome country. In certain jurisdictions, CASA IDs are recognized for the purposes of engaging with \ncertain government agencies, including the police. \n94.  CASA has members who have been paroled into the United States, including \nmembers who have received parole after presenting at a land port of entry with a CBP One \nappointment and through the CHNV parole processes.  \n95.  CASA John Doe 1, for example, is a CASA member originally from Venezuela who \nnow resides in Maryland. His sister, who has TPS, sponsored him to come to the United States on \nthe Venezuelan CHNV parole program in May 2023. After arriving, CASA John Doe 1 applied for \nand was granted TPS as well, but with the administration’s early termination of Venezuelan TPS, \nthat status is set to expire in April. CASA John Doe 1 works in construction and lives with his wife \nand 9-year-old daughter, who depend on him for financial support. He fears returning to Venezuela, \nbecause he was targeted by the government there. If he were subjected to expedited removal, he \nwould be separated from his family, which would be especially harmful for his young daughter. \nHe is also the sole breadwinner for his family, and they would struggle to support themselves \nwithout him. CASA John Doe 1 has worked hard to build a life in the United States, to establish a \nsafe place for himself and his family to thrive. He is active in his community and regularly attends \nchurch. He is proud to pay his taxes and abide by the law in this country.  \n96.  CASA Jane Doe 1 is a CASA member originally from Honduras who currently \nresides in Maryland. A single mother, she and her three children – ages 18, 13, and 6 – entered the \nUnited States on humanitarian parole after attending a CBP One appointment at the southern \nborder in July 2024. CASA Jane Doe 1’s youngest two children are in school in the U.S., which is \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 29 of 35\n \nan opportunity they did not have while living in Honduras, and she works at a fruit factory, helping \nto pack fruit for distribution, to ensure that her family have their daily necessities. CASA Jane Doe \n1 fears being deported to Honduras, because she faced domestic violence by her ex-partner there, \nincluding death threats against her and the children. She is very afraid of being separated from her \nchildren, because they could not support themselves without her.  She has a pending asylum claim \nthat she would not be able to pursue from Honduras as well. Rapid deportation would deprive her \nof the opportunity to find safety in the U.S. for herself and her children. \n97.  CASA John Doe 2 and CASA Jane Doe 2 are a married couple originally from \nVenezuela who currently live in Maryland. They, along with their four children – ages 16, 13, 8, \nand 5 – were granted humanitarian parole through CBP One in July 2024. CASA John Doe 2 works \nas a DoorDash driver to support their family, and CASA Jane Doe 2 devotes her time to taking \ncare of their children. Their 8-year-old son suffers from a disability called psychomotor delay that \nslows his learning process. He still requires diapers, has difficulty walking, and cannot write. He \nrequires constant support. While he does attend school, CASA Jane Doe 2 often has to go to the \nschool to help the teachers with his care. CASA John Doe 2 was a politically active small business \nowner back in Venezuela, and he was targeted and attacked by the government for supporting its \nopposition. If he and CASA Jane Doe 2 were subject to rapid, expedited deportation back to \nVenezuela, they fear their family’s safety would be at risk, and they would not be able to pursue \ntheir pending asylum claims. \n98.  CASA is acutely aware of the harms that Defendants’ application of expedited \nremoval to parolees will cause. CASA has heard from its members that there is widespread \nconfusion and fear from the administration’s decisions to end parole processes and expand \nexpedited removal. There has also been a chilling effect among members, with members unsure \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 30 of 35\n \nabout whether it is safe to share their information with government agencies, including by applying \nfor further immigration benefits for which they qualify. Given all of the recent policy reversals, \nthey have significant and legitimate fear that their information will now be weaponized against \nthem.  \n99.  CASA members who may be eligible for asylum or Convention Against Torture \nprotections in the United States still fear that they could be deported through expedited removal, \ngiven the ever-shifting nature of policy changes within this administration. They do not know if \nthey will be able to have their case properly heard by an immigration judge, or if anyone will care \nabout their legitimate fear of return.  \n100.  In response, CASA has devoted significant resources to deportation defense and \npreparing its membership for potential immigration enforcement actions, including developing \nnew Know Your Rights resources and devoting additional resources to immigration counseling \nand rapid response to immigration enforcement. Stripping legal protections from hundreds of \nthousands of people, and subjecting them to rapid deportation via expedited removal, has a deep \nnegative impact on CASA’s membership. \n101.  All of the foregoing allegations are incorporated into each of the following claims \nfor relief as set forth therein. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n102.  An immigration officer may process a noncitizen for expedited removal upon \ndetermining that such noncitizen “is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii)” \nand  is  inadmissible  under  8  U.S.C.  §§  1182(a)(6)(C)  or  1182(a)(7).  See  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 31 of 35\n \n103.  Subclause (I) of clause (iii) referenced above provides that the Secretary may apply \nexpedited  removal  to  “any  or  all  aliens  described  in  subclause  (II)  as  designated  by  the \n[Secretary].” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n104.  Subclause (II) referenced above includes a description of noncitizens who may be \ndesignated  by  the  Secretary  to  be  amenable  to  expedited  removal  and  specifies  that  such \nnoncitizens must not “ha[ve] been admitted or paroled into the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). A noncitizen who “ha[s] been admitted or paroled following inspection by \nan immigration officer at a designated port-of-entry” is excluded from expedited removal under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii). See also 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) (requiring \nthat noncitizen be given a “reasonable opportunity” to establish to an immigration officer “that he \nor she was admitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a port-of-entry,” and \ncannot thereby be processed for expedited removal). \n105.  The February 18 directive violates the INA and is “not in accordance with law” and \n“in excess of statutory . . . authority” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), to the extent that \nit authorizes the use of expedited removal for noncitizens who were inspected and granted parole \nat a port of entry and are currently present in the United States subsequent to that parole. Such \nindividuals have already arrived in the United States and have begun establishing their lives here \nand are therefore no longer in the act of “arriving.” Because such noncitizens are not “arriving in \nthe  United  States,”  they  cannot  be  subjected  to  expedited  removal  under  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n106.  The January 23 Huffman memorandum and the March 21 CHNV Termination \nNotice violate the INA and are “not in accordance with law” and “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), to the extent that they authorize the use of \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 32 of 35\n \nso-called expanded expedited removal for CHNV and other parole beneficiaries who have not \n“been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior \nto the date of the determination of inadmissibility.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). See CHNV \nTermination Notice (noting that “CHNV parolees . . . will become ineligible for expedited removal \nupon the natural expiration of their two-year parole.”). Such individuals “ha[ve] been . . . paroled \ninto the United States,” which makes them ineligible for expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), regardless of whether they have been physically present in the United States \nfor less than two years. \n107.  Each of these policies must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, and/or otherwise \nvacated. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)) \n108.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n109.  The agency’s various articulations of its authority to expose individuals inspected \nand granted parole at ports of entry to expedited removal are unexplained and entirely inconsistent \nwith each other. In the January 23 Huffman memorandum and the March 21 CHNV Termination \nNotice, the Department contemplates using expedited removal against parolees pursuant to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). The March 21 CHNV Termination Notice in particular is clear that \nunder the expedited removal statute, CHNV parolees may be removed only under this provision, \nwhich is why the Department decided to terminate their paroles precipitously in order to maximize \nthe number of people who may be expeditiously removed by minimizing the number who have \nbeen continuously present in the country for two years. The February 18 directive, however, \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 33 of 35\n \nappears to make all individuals who were granted parole at ports of entry and are now present in \nthe United States eligible for expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). The directive \nadditionally is explicit that “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to process [such parole \nbeneficiaries] for expedited removal.” \n110.  None of the agency policies described above contains any reasoned explanation for \nwhy parole beneficiaries may be processed for expedited removal, and any explanation that exists \nin the January 23 and March 21 agency policies is inconsistent with any explanation that exists in \nthe February 18 directive. The arbitrariness and capriciousness of each agency policy is further \nevidenced by the failure of such policy to consider the agency’s own contrary conclusions \nregarding the legal authority for the agency to adopt the policy as contemplated. Indeed, the \ninconsistent agency interpretations are both incorrect as a matter of law. \n111.  Moreover, none of the agency policies consider the impact of their decision to apply \nexpedited  removal  to  some  population  of  parolees  on  paroled  individuals  themselves,  their \nfamilies, their communities, and any financial supporters, as well as any reasonable alternatives. \n112.  Each of these policies must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, and/or otherwise \nvacated.  \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to  \nthe United States Constitution) \n113.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall . \n. . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n114.  Plaintiffs who are at risk of being subjected to expedited removal under the January \n23 Huffman memorandum, the February 18 directive, and/or the March 21 CHNV Termination \nNotice are entitled under the Due Process Clause to notice, an opportunity to be heard, and to have \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872     Document 1     Filed 03/24/25     Page 34 of 35\n \nthe law correctly applied to their cases, including to a meaningful process before they can be \nremoved from the country. \n115.  The January 23 Huffman memorandum, the February 18 directive, and the March \n21 Federal Register Notice must therefore be enjoined as violative of the Fifth Amendment’s \nguarantee of due process. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare that noncitizens who have previously been granted parole at ports of entry \nare not amenable to expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) and that the January 23 \nHuffman memorandum, February 18 directive, and March 21 CHNV Termination Notice are \nunconstitutional and contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \n2.  Preliminarily enjoin and stay the January 23 Huffman memorandum, February 18 \ndirective, and March 21 CHNV Termination Notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n65(a) and 5 U.S.C. § 705 during the pendency of this suit; \n3.

INTRODUCTION \nM.A.R., a Cuban national, arrived at the San Ysidro port of entry in San Diego, California, \non March 14, 2024. ECF 22-8 ¶ 17. 1 Although he entered with travel authorization, he hoped to \nstay in the United States because he faced threats, harassment, and retaliation from Cuban \nauthorities for his vocal opposition to the Cuban Government. Id. ¶ 29. Upon inspection at the \nborder, he was paroled into the United States (i.e., released into the country pending removal \nproceedings) and issued a Notice to Appear (NTA) in immigration court. Id. ¶¶ 17–18. Since \narriving, he has obtained work authorization and a job, married a United States citizen, met all his \nlegal obligations, and committed no crimes. Id. ¶ 19. He also filed an application for adjustment \nof status under the Cuban Adjustment Act (CAA), which has long permitted Cuban nationals who \nwere admitted or paroled into the United States to become lawful permanent residents after being \nhere for more than a year. See Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 (“CAA”), 89 Pub. L. 732, 80 Stat. \n1161; 8 U.S.C. § 1255 note; ECF 22-8 at 26.  \nOn May 28, 2025, M.A.R. attended his first hearing at the immigration court in Santa Ana, \nCalifornia. ECF 22-8 ¶ 21. Immediately after exiting the courtroom at the end of his hearing, \nM.A.R. was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers. Id. ¶ 25. His \npending immigration proceeding had not been dismissed at the hearing, and he received no \nindication at that hearing (or upon his arrest) that anything about his parole or proceedings had \nchanged. Id. ¶¶ 23, 25–27. No indication, that is, besides his unexplained detention. M.A.R.’s \nattorney determined that he was being subjected to expedited removal, an abbreviated alternative \nto standard removal proceedings applicable only to certain noncitizens. Id. ¶ 27. Even so, he has \n \n1 Unless otherwise indicated, the formatting of citations has been modified throughout this opinion, for example, by \nomitting internal quotation marks, emphases, citations, and alterations and by altering capitalization.

Id.  ¶¶ 26, 30;  see  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(B)(ii). Unless M.A.R. passes that screening, which comes with limited administrative \nappeal rights and no judicial review, he will be unable to pursue adjustment of status under the \nCAA or based on his marriage—and he will be sent back to Cuba. \n  R.J.L.B., a Venezuelan national, arrived at the San Ysidro port of entry on January 17, \n2025, with a scheduled appointment using the “CBP One” application.2 ECF 22-14 ¶¶ 3–4. An \nofficer in the Venezuelan military, R.J.L.B. seeks to defect to the United States to assist the U.S. \nmilitary or intelligence services. Id. ¶¶ 3, 9. His home and his family in Venezuela are under \nsurveillance by the Venezuelan government, and he believes he will be killed for desertion and \ndisobedience if he is forced to return. Id. ¶¶ 3, 12. After inspection at San Ysidro, he was paroled \ninto the United States and received an NTA. Id. ¶ 4. A month later, he submitted his application \nfor asylum. Id. ¶ 6. When he appeared for a hearing on May 21, 2025, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity (DHS) attorney moved orally to dismiss his case. Id. ¶ 7. His attorney, believing this \ndismissal meant DHS thought he had a good case for asylum and could handle it administratively \n(as is often done in the attorney’s experience), did not oppose the motion. Id. Neither the DHS \nattorney nor the Immigration Judge (IJ) mentioned expedited removal. Yet, as soon as R.J.L.B. \nleft his hearing, ICE officers arrested him, telling him he was being removed through expedited \nremoval. Id. ¶ 8. When R.J.L.B. and his attorney informed the ICE officers that he was a military \nofficer seeking to help the United States, they “openly scoffed.” Id. at ¶ 9. His attorney does not \n \n2 CBP One was a mobile application launched by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in October 2020. ECF \n22-2 ¶ 11. It enabled noncitizens to book an appointment to appear for inspection at a port of entry, submit information \nin advance, and potentially obtain parole or admission into the country. See id.; U.S. Customs and Border Protection, \nCBP Removes Scheduling Functionality in CBP One™ App (Jan. 21, 2025),  https://perma.cc/4XCF-ZX2S. At noon \non January 20, 2025, DHS removed the scheduling functionality from the CBP One app. See id. DHS has also since \nrenamed the application CBP Home, which it now says facilitates “voluntary self-deport[ation].” See Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., CBP Home: Assistance to Voluntarily Self-Deport, https://perma.cc/C9ED-4YPQ.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 4 of 84\nknow whether he has received a credible fear interview or will receive consideration for asylum \nor other relief before being removed. Id. ¶¶ 10–13.   \n  M.A.R. and R.J.L.B. are two of hundreds of thousands of noncitizens who were paroled \ninto the United States in recent years after inspection at a port of entry and who now face the threat \nof removal under highly truncated procedures that have rarely, if ever, been applied at any scale \nto parolees. Organizations whose memberships include tens of thousands of such parolees have \ncome to this Court to challenge three recent DHS agency actions that expanded expedited removal \nto this new population. They seek a stay of those actions pending final resolution of this case. \nNarrowly, this is a straightforward case of statutory interpretation and agency rationality. \nNeither  the  applicable  statutes  nor  principles  of  reasoned  decision-making  authorizes  the \nchallenged agency actions. More broadly, this case presents a question of fair play. Plaintiffs’ \nmembers, and hundreds of thousands of others like them, fled oppressive regimes and perilous \nconditions in their home countries. They arrived for inspection at the United States border pursuant \nto procedures created and advocated by the U.S. Government. They were paroled into this country \nunder those procedures and given the chance to prove their claims for asylum or other relief \nauthorized by our laws. In a world of bad options, they played by the rules. Now, the Government \nhas not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already \nhere, restricting their ability to seek immigration relief and subjecting them to summary removal \ndespite statutory law prohibiting the Executive Branch from doing so. This case’s underlying \nquestion, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their \ncase within a system of rules. Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country \nthat—as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 5 of 84\nwithout explanation or charges, see, e.g., ECF 22-10 ¶ 7; ECF 22-13 ¶ 9—may look to them more \nand more like the countries from which they tried to escape? \nThis Court will GRANT the requested stay. The challenged agency actions exceed DHS’s \nstatutory authority and are arbitrary and capricious. And Plaintiffs’ members and others in their \nposition face imminent, irreparable injury from those actions that outweighs any harm to the \nGovernment or the public from pressing pause. Accordingly, the challenged agency actions will \nbe stayed, until the conclusion of this litigation, as to all noncitizens who have been, at any point \nin time, paroled into the United States at a port of entry. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Statutory and Regulatory Framework \n1.  Expedited Removal \ni.  What Is Expedited Removal? \nIn  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and  Immigrant  Responsibility  Act  of  1996 \n(“IIRAIRA”),  Congress  established  two  main  processes  for  removing  noncitizens  deemed \nineligible to enter or remain in the United States. 3 See IIRAIRA, Pub. L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009, \n3009-546 (1996). The first, commonly referred to as “section 240” proceedings due to the statutory \nsection in which they appear, are the standard mechanism for removing inadmissible noncitizens.4 \nSection 240 removal proceedings take place before an IJ, an employee of the Department of Justice \n(DOJ) who must be a licensed attorney and has a duty to develop the record in cases before them. \n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(1), (b)(1) (“The immigration judge shall administer oaths, receive evidence, \n \n3 The statute and regulations at issue typically use the term “alien” rather than “noncitizen.” However, Plaintiffs \nadvocate using the term “noncitizen.” ECF 35 at 8 (Hr’g Tr. 8:2–10). Accordingly, the Court will use “noncitizen” \nunless quoting from a statute or regulation that uses “alien.” \n4 Defendants sometimes refer to these proceedings instead as “section 1229a” proceedings, because that is the section \nof Chapter 8 of the U.S. Code in which section 240 of IIRAIRA was later codified. For simplicity, the Court will stick \nwith “section 240” unless otherwise necessary for clarity. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 6 of 84\nand interrogate, examine, and cross-examine the alien and any witnesses.”); ECF 22-6 ¶¶ 4, 6.5 \nThey are adversarial proceedings in which the noncitizen has the right to hire counsel, examine \nand present evidence, and cross-examine witnesses. 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4). The hearings are \nrecorded, and a transcript is made available if a party appeals the decision. Id. § 1229a(b)(4)(C); \nECF 22-6 ¶ 13. A section 240 proceeding typically takes place over the course of multiple hearings \ndue to the built-in procedures. ECF 22-6 ¶ 9. This allows time for noncitizens to both gather \nevidence in support of petitions for relief available in immigration court (like asylum and certain \nadjustments of status) and seek collateral relief from other components of DHS (like adjustment \nof status on the basis of marriage or family). Id. Upon a decision by the IJ, either party may appeal \nto the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA). 8 C.F.R. §§ 1240.15, 1003.1. If the BIA upholds a \nremoval order, the noncitizen may then appeal that decision to a U.S. court of appeals. 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252. The Congress that passed IIRAIRA referred to the new section 240 as a “streamlined” \nremoval process relative to what came before it because, among other things, it removed a layer \nof appellate review. H.R. Rep. 104-469, at 12, 107–08 (1996). And, replacing the multiplicity of \nproceedings that preceded it, the new section 240 framework would be a “single form of removal \nproceeding” “[f]or illegal aliens already present in the U.S.” Id. at 108. \nStill, IIRAIRA included a second, even more streamlined form of proceeding applicable \nonly to certain noncitizens: expedited removal. Relative to section 240 removal, “[e]xpedited \nremoval lives up to its name.” Make the Rd. New York v. Wolf, 962 F.3d 612, 619 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \nIn expedited removal, an immigration officer, not an IJ, conducts the initial fact-finding. 8 C.F.R. \n \n5 Plaintiffs’ motion includes a declaration from A. Ashley Tabaddor, who among other credentials previously served \nas an Immigration Judge, as President of the National Association of Immigration Judges, and as Chief Counsel at the \nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) at DHS. See ECF 22-6 ¶ 2. Her declaration includes helpful \ninformation about removal proceedings that this Court considers alongside—and only to the extent it is not \ninconsistent with—the applicable statutes and regulations. Defendants have not objected to anything in her declaration \nor its use as evidence here. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 7 of 84\n§ 235.3(b)(2)(i). If a noncitizen is eligible for expedited removal, an immigration officer asks them \na short series of questions to determine (a) their “identity, alienage, and inadmissibility,” and (b) \nwhether they intend to apply for asylum, fear persecution or torture, or fear returning to their \ncountry of origin. Id. § 235.3(b)(2)(i), (b)(4). Noncitizens are not entitled to counsel during this \nquestioning, and no recording or transcript is made. ECF 22-6 ¶¶ 11, 17; compare 8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(2)(i) with 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(4)(C). If the noncitizen is inadmissible and does not \nindicate intent to apply for asylum or fear of persecution or torture, the inspecting officer issues a \nNotice and Order of Expedited Removal (NOER), and the noncitizen may respond in a sworn \nstatement. 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(i). Once a supervising officer reviews and signs off on the \ninspecting officer’s determination, the noncitizen is ordered removed. See id. The noncitizen has \nno right to appeal that decision to an IJ, the BIA, or (with one exception discussed below) any \ncourt. Id. § 235.3(b)(2)(ii); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A)(i). \n  “The process is scarcely more involved” if the noncitizen “assert[s] an intention to apply \nfor asylum or a fear of prosecution.” Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 619. If the noncitizen so indicates, \nthe inspecting officer must refer them to a “credible fear interview,” to be conducted by an asylum \nofficer. 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(4). If that asylum officer finds the noncitizen to have a credible fear \nof persecution, the noncitizen will be moved either to full section 240 removal proceedings or to \nUSCIS administrative asylum proceedings. Id. § 208.30(f). If, however, the officer makes a \nnegative credible fear determination, a supervisory officer will review the determination. Id. \n§ 208.30(e)(8). And if the supervisor agrees, the noncitizen can request review by an IJ. Id. \n§ 208.30(g). The IJ’s review “is meant to conclude within 24 hours” and is final. Make the Rd., \n962 F.3d at 619. With narrow exceptions discussed below, no further administrative or judicial \nreview is available. Id. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 8 of 84\n  Unlike section 240 proceedings, which often take place over the course of several months, \nthe expedited removal process is “conducted on a very compressed schedule and can result in \ndeportation in hours or days.” ECF 22-6 ¶ 11. As a result, noncitizens subject to expedited removal \nhave little time to secure counsel—and no right to a continuance to give them time to do so. Id. \nAnd although the noncitizen may bring counsel to their credible fear interview, they typically have \nonly a short window (24 to 48 hours on average) to secure counsel and ensure they can attend the \ninterview. Id. ¶ 12. Meanwhile, asylum officers have no explicit duty to advise noncitizens of their \nrights or the requirements for relief. Id. ¶ 13. That fast pace also gives noncitizens little time to \nprepare evidence related to their credible-fear claim. Id. ¶ 17. Further, noncitizens in expedited \nremoval have no way to pursue any other immigration relief besides asylum, such as adjustment \nof status or family-based petitions (e.g., for marriage)—even if they are eligible and were pursuing \nthem before entering expedited removal. Id. ¶ 16. Only if they establish credible fear and return to \nsection 240 proceedings can they then continue to pursue those other forms of relief. Id. ¶¶ 16–17. \nCompounding all those challenges, noncitizens are typically detained pending the outcome of their \nexpedited removal proceedings, often in remote locations that may be far from their counsel or \nfamilies. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(B)(iii)(IV); 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(2)(iii); ECF 22-6 ¶¶ 17–20. \n  Key to that expedition is the lack of almost any role for judicial review. IIRAIRA provides \nthat “no court shall have jurisdiction to review” issues related to expedited removal unless they \nfall into a narrow set of exceptions outlined at 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e). 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(A). Under \nsubsection (e), two forms of judicial proceedings are available. First, a noncitizen may file a habeas \npetition to challenge their expedited removal. However, that habeas proceeding is limited to the \nnarrow grounds of (a) whether the petitioner is an alien, (b) whether the petitioner was ordered \nremoved under the expedited removal provision, and (c) whether the petitioner can prove that they \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 9 of 84\nwere lawfully admitted or granted asylum. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(2). Second, noncitizens may \nchallenge expedited removal determinations, as well as the implementation of the expedited \nremoval section, in this Court. Id. § 1252(e)(3)(A). In such suits, referred to in the statute as \n“[c]hallenges on validity of the system,” a plaintiff may challenge either (i) whether the statute’s \nexpedited removal section, or any regulation implementing it, is constitutional, or (ii) “whether \nsuch a regulation, or a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure \nissued by or under the authority of the Attorney General to implement such section, is not \nconsistent with applicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law.” Id. \n§ 1252(e)(3). This kind of suit must be filed within 60 days after the date the challenged statutory \nprovision or agency action is first implemented, id. § 1252(e)(3)(B), and it may not be a class \naction, id. § 1252(e)(1)(B).  \n  Finally, the statute limits the relief a court may grant in such cases. Specifically, it provides, \nRegardless of the nature of the action or claim or of the identity of the party or \nparties bringing the action, no court (other than the Supreme Court) shall have \njurisdiction or authority to enjoin or restrain the operation of the provisions of part \nIV  of  this  subchapter,  as  amended  by  the  Illegal  Immigration  Reform  and \nImmigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 [which includes the expedited removal \nsection],  other  than  with  respect  to  the  application  of  such  provisions  to  an \nindividual alien against whom proceedings under such part have been initiated.    \nId. § 1252(f)(1). \n  All that said, the expedited removal regulations provide a few other escape hatches for \nindividuals to prove that they are not in fact eligible for expedited removal under the statute. \nSpecifically, during the initial interview by the immigration officer, an individual in expedited \nremoval proceedings may “claim[] to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence, \nadmitted as a refugee under section 207 of the Act, granted asylum under section 208 of the Act, \nor claim[] to be a U.S. citizen.” 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(5)(i). If the immigration officer can verify any \nof those claims, the individual will not be removed. Id. § 235.3(b)(5)(ii-iv). If the immigration \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 10 of 84\nofficer cannot verify the claim, but the individual makes the claim under penalty of perjury, the \ncase is referred for review by an IJ. Id. § 235.3(b)(5)(iv). In addition, the regulation provides that \nthe individual must be given “a reasonable opportunity to establish to the satisfaction of the \nexamining immigration officer that he or she was admitted or paroled into the United States \nfollowing inspection at a port-of-entry.” Id. § 235.3(b)(6). “If the alien establishes that he or she \nwas lawfully admitted or paroled,” the regulation continues, the agency reviews whether the \nnoncitizen’s parole “has been, or should be, terminated.” Id. If the noncitizen cannot establish that \nthey were “lawfully admitted or paroled,” they “will be ordered removed pursuant to” the \nexpedited removal provision. Id. \nii.  Who Is Subject to Expedited Removal? \nNoncitizens may be eligible for expedited, rather than section 240, removal only if they are \ninadmissible  on  the  basis  that  they  either  lack  proper  entry  documents  or  falsified  or \nmisrepresented  their  application  for  admission.  8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i);  see  id. \n§ 1182(a)(6)(C), (a)(7) (grounds of inadmissibility). Among that set, only two categories of \nnoncitizens are eligible for expedited removal: (1) noncitizens “arriving in the United States,” and \n(2) noncitizens who “ha[ve] not been admitted or paroled into the United States” and cannot \naffirmatively show that they have been “physically present in the United States continuously for \nthe 2-year period immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(i)–(iii).6 The statute permits the Attorney General (who has since delegated this \nauthority to the DHS Secretary) to designate the population of noncitizens within that second \ncategory who will be subject to expedited removal. And that designation lies within the Secretary’s \n \n6 In addition, the statute exempts from expedited removal noncitizens who are “native[s] or citizen[s] of a country in \nthe Western Hemisphere with whose government the United States does not have full diplomatic relations and who \narrives by aircraft at a port of entry.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(F). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 11 of 84\n“sole and unreviewable discretion.” Id. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii); see 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(ii).7 This \nopinion refers to the statutory provision outlining the first category as the “Arriving Aliens \nProvision,” and the provision defining the second category as the “Designation Provision.” \nThe statute itself does not define “arriving” for purposes of the Arriving Aliens Provision. \nBut a DHS regulation first promulgated in 1997, the year after the statute’s passage, does. See \nInspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Detention and Removal of Aliens; Conduct of \nRemoval  Proceedings;  Asylum  Procedures,  62  Fed.  Reg.  10312,  10312–13  (Mar.  6,  1997) \n[hereinafter 1997 Rulemaking]. That definition has been altered only slightly since 1997 and today \nreads as follows: \nArriving alien means an applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into \nthe United States at a port-of-entry, or an alien seeking transit through the United \nStates at a port-of-entry, or an alien interdicted in international or United States \nwaters and brought into the United States by any means, whether or not to a \ndesignated port-of-entry, and regardless of the means of transport. An arriving alien \nremains an arriving alien even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act, \nand even after any such parole is terminated or revoked. However, an arriving alien \nwho was paroled into the United States before April 1, 1997, or who was paroled \ninto the United States on or after April 1, 1997, pursuant to a grant of advance \nparole which the alien applied for and obtained in the United States prior to the \nalien’s departure from and return to the United States, will not be treated, solely by \nreason of that grant of parole, as an arriving alien under section 235(b)(1)(A)(i) of \nthe Act.  \n8 C.F.R. § 1.2; see id. § 235.3(b)(i) (applying that definition). \n  The regulation also expands upon the criteria for designation under the Designation \nProvision. Eligible for designation under that section are  \naliens who arrive in, attempt to enter, or have entered the United States without \nhaving been admitted or paroled following inspection by an immigration officer at \na designated port-of-entry, and who have not established to the satisfaction of the \nimmigration officer that they have been physically present in the United States \n \n7 This designation authority originally belonged to the Commissioner of the Immigration and Nationalization Service \nbefore that agency was abolished and DHS was created in 2002. See Make the Rd. New York v. McAleenan, 405 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 16 n.7 (D.D.C. 2019) (K.B. Jackson, J.) (citing Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 \nStat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002); 6 U.S.C. § 557).  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 12 of 84\ncontinuously for the 2–year period immediately prior to the date of determination \nof inadmissibility.  \n8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(ii).  \n  Since IIRAIRA’s passage, the Executive Branch has altered its designation under that \nprovision a handful of times. Initially, DHS’s predecessor agency8 did not make any designation \nunder the Designation Provision, thereby limiting expedited removal only to “arriving aliens.” \n1997 Rulemaking, 62 Fed. Reg. at 10313. In so doing, the agency “acknowledge[d] that application \nof the expedited removal provisions to aliens already in the United States w[ould] involve more \ncomplex determinations of fact and will be more difficult to manage.” Id. In fact, no designation \nwas made under the Designation Provision until 2002, when the DHS Secretary designated for \nexpedited removal “aliens who arrive in the United States by sea, either by boat or other means, \nwho are not admitted or paroled, and who have not been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously  for  the  two-year  period  prior  to  a  determination  of  inadmissibility.”  Notice \nDesignating  Aliens  Subject  to  Expedited  Removal  Under  Section  235(b)(1)(A)(iii)  of  the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, 67 Fed. Reg. 68924, 68925 (Nov. 13, 2002).  \n  DHS has made four other designations, or recissions of designations, between that 2002 \nNotice and today: \n•  In 2004, DHS designated noncitizens “who are physically present in the U.S. without \nhaving been admitted or paroled following inspection by an immigration officer at a \ndesignated port-of-entry, who are encountered by an immigration officer within 100 air \nmiles of any U.S. international land border, and who have not established to the satisfaction \n \n8 The Commissioner of the Immigration and Nationalization Service (INS) used to make this designation before that \nagency was abolished and DHS was created in 2002. See Make the Rd. New York v. McAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1, \n16 n.7 (D.D.C. 2019) (K.B. Jackson, J.) (citing Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 \n(Nov. 25, 2002); 6 U.S.C. § 557).  \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 13 of 84\nof an immigration officer that they have been physically present in the U.S. continuously \nfor the 14-day period immediately prior to the date of encounter.” Designating Aliens For \nExpedited Removal, 69 Fed. Reg. 48877, 48880 (Aug. 11, 2004). \n•  In 2019, DHS additionally designated “[a]liens . . . who are physically present in the \nUnited  States  without  having  been  admitted  or  paroled  following  inspection  by  an \nimmigration officer at a designated port of entry, and who either (a) did not arrive by sea, \nare encountered by an immigration officer anywhere in the United States more than 100 \nair miles from a U.S. international land border, and have not been physically present in the \nUnited States continuously for the two-year period immediately prior to the date of the \ndetermination of inadmissibility, or (b) did not arrive by sea, are encountered by an \nimmigration officer within 100 air miles from a U.S. international land border, and have \nbeen physically present in the United States continuously at least 14 days but less than two \nyears immediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility.” Designating \nAliens for Expedited Removal, 84 Fed. Reg. 35409, 35414 (July 23, 2019) [hereinafter \n2019  Designation  Notice].  This  designation,  when  combined  with  the  previous \ndesignations, expanded expedited removal to the full scope of the statutory authorization \nunder the Designation Provision. See id. at 35411. This Designation Notice clarified that it \n“d[id] not apply to aliens who arrive at U.S. ports of entry, because those aliens are already \nsubject to expedited removal.” Id. at 35414. \n•  In 2022, DHS rescinded the 2019 designation while leaving in place the 2002 and 2004 \ndesignations. Rescission of the Notice of July 23, 2019, Designating Aliens for Expedited \nRemoval, 87 Fed. Reg. 16022, 16022 (Mar. 21, 2022) [hereinafter 2022 Rescission \nNotice].  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 14 of 84\n•  In January of 2025, DHS rescinded the 2022 Recission Notice, returning the designation \nto its 2019 scope. Designating Aliens for Expedited Removal, 90 Fed. Reg. 8139, 8139 \n(Jan. 24, 2025) [hereinafter 2025 Designation Notice].9 \nThus, as of January 21, 2025, DHS asserts the authority to apply expedited removal to all \nnoncitizens described in the Designation Provision, alongside those described in the Arriving \nAliens Provision, for the first time since the 2019 Designation Notice.10 \n2.  Parole \nImmigration law has long allowed the Executive Branch to exercise its discretion to \ntemporarily allow into the United States noncitizens who are applying for admission to the country \ninstead of holding them in detention. See 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Currently, the DHS Secretary \nholds that parole authority by statute.11 See id. Parole may be granted “under such conditions as \n[the DHS Secretary] may prescribe” and “only on a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian \nreasons or significant public benefit.” Id. Parole “shall not be regarded as an admission of the \nalien.” Id. And the DHS Secretary may, in their discretion, terminate any grant of parole and return \nthe noncitizen “to the custody from which he was paroled.” Id. At that point, the noncitizen’s “case \nshall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to \nthe United States.” Id.  \n \n9 This Notice was effective on January 21, 2025, and was published in the Federal Register on January 24, 2025. See \n2025 Designation Notice, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8139. \n10 That chronology overstates the amount of time in which DHS executed on that full designation; the 2019 \nDesignation Notice was preliminarily enjoined in September 2019. See Make the Rd., 405 F. Supp. 3d at 72. The D.C. \nCircuit reversed that preliminary injunction the following year, in June 2020. See Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 635. And \nin February 2021, President Biden directed DHS to consider rescinding the 2019 designation, suggesting the \nadministration had begun de-prioritizing its enforcement. See Exec. Order 14010, 86 Fed. Reg. 8267, 8270–71 (Feb. \n2, 2021). \n11 The Secretary has further delegated that authority by regulation to various officials below them. See 8 C.F.R. \n§ 212.5(a).  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 15 of 84\nCongress has amended the parole statute a few times since its original enactment. Notably, \nin 1996, Congress restricted the Executive Branch’s discretion under the statute by adding the \nlanguage that parole be granted only on “a case-by-case basis for urgent humanitarian reasons or \nsignificant public benefit.” See IIRAIRA § 602(a), 110 Stat. at 3009-689. Congress also added a \nreporting requirement, in which the Executive must report to Congress each year “the number and \ncategories of aliens paroled into the United States” and related data. Id. § 602(b), 110 Stat. at 3009-\n689–90. \nA DHS regulation fleshes out the conditions under which the DHS Secretary and her \ndelegees may grant and terminate parole. See 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(a). As relevant here, the regulation \nprovides that DHS may terminate a noncitizen’s parole either “automatically” or “[o]n notice.” Id. \n§ 212.5(e)(1), (e)(2). A grant of parole terminates automatically, without written notice, (a) when \nthe noncitizen departs the United States, or (b) “if not departed, at the expiration of the time for \nwhich parole was authorized.” Id. § 212.5(e)(1). In all other cases, parole “shall be terminated \nupon written notice to the alien.” Id. § 212.5(e)(2). Those other cases include when the “purpose \nfor which parole was authorized” is “accomplish[ed]” or “when in the opinion of” the DHS \nSecretary or their delegee “neither humanitarian reasons nor public benefit warrants the continued \npresence of the alien in the United States.” Id. A “charging document” (i.e., “the written instrument \nwhich initiates a proceeding before an Immigration Judge”) constitutes written notice “unless \notherwise specified.” Id; id. § 244.1.12 At that point, the noncitizen either moves to “further \n \n12 The parole regulation does not define “charging document,” but other sections in the same chapter of the Code of \nFederal Regulations define it as follows: “Charging document means the written instrument which initiates a \nproceeding before an Immigration Judge. For proceedings initiated prior to April 1, 1997, these documents include an \nOrder to Show Cause, a Notice to Applicant for Admission Detained for Hearing before Immigration Judge, and a \nNotice of Intention to Rescind and Request for Hearing by Alien. For proceedings initiated after April 1, 1997, these \ndocuments include a Notice to Appear, a Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, and a Notice of Intention to Rescind \nand Request for Hearing by Alien.” 8 C.F.R. § 244.1; id. § 1003.13; see also 1997 Rulemaking, 62 Fed. Reg. 10312, \n10332 (defining the term in the same exact way in the regulation adopting IIRAIRA’s changes to parole and expedited \nremoval).  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 16 of 84\ninspection or hearing” under “section 235 or 240 of the Act,” or any previous “order of exclusion, \ndeportation, or removal” against the noncitizen “shall be executed.” Id. § 212.5(e)(2). \n  In 2022 and 2023, DHS issued four notices establishing parole processes for nationals from \nCuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela—referred to collectively in this opinion as the “CHNV \nParole Programs.” See Implementation of a Parole Process for Venezuelans, 87 Fed. Reg. 63507 \n(Oct. 19, 2022); Implementation of a Parole Process for Cubans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1266 (Jan. 9, 2023); \nImplementation of a Parole Process for Haitians, 88 Fed. Reg. 1243 (Jan. 9, 2023); Implementation \nof a Parole Process for Nicaraguans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1255 (Jan. 9, 2023). Each notice created a \nprocess under which noncitizens, along with a U.S.-based supporter, could apply in advance to \ntravel to a U.S. port of entry. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. at 63515–16. Once the noncitizen arrived at a \nport of entry, they would be subjected to inspection and additional vetting and “considered for a \ngrant of discretionary parole for a period of up to two years on a case-by-case-basis.” Id. at 63516. \nIf granted parole, that parole would generally last for “up to two years, subject to applicable health \nand vetting requirements.” Id. During that period of parole, the noncitizen would be “eligible to \napply for employment authorization under existing regulations.” Id. Between October 2022 and \nJanuary 2025, approximately 532,000 noncitizens were paroled into the United States under the \nCHNV Parole Programs. Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and \nVenezuelans,  90  Fed.  Reg.  13611,  13612  (Mar.  25,  2025)  [hereinafter  March  25  CHNV \nTermination Notice].  \n  On October 4, 2024, DHS announced that it would not “re-parole” anyone paroled under \nthe CHNV Parole Programs. Id. Accordingly, once their initial period of parole—granted when \nthey arrived for inspection at a port of entry—ended, CHNV parolees would have to “leave the \nUnited States” or would otherwise be “placed in removal proceedings.” Id. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 17 of 84\n  Then, on March 25, 2025, DHS announced that it was terminating the CHNV Parole \nPrograms entirely. Id. at 13611. Accordingly, DHS announced, \nThe temporary parole period of aliens in the United States under the CHNV parole \nprograms and whose parole has not already expired by April 24, 2025 will terminate \non that date unless the Secretary makes an individual determination to the contrary. \nParolees without a lawful basis to remain in the United States following this \ntermination of the CHNV parole programs must depart the United States before \ntheir parole termination date. \nId.  \nA group of noncitizens challenged the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice. Judge \nTalwani in the District of Massachusetts stayed the Notice “insofar as it revokes, without case-by-\ncase review, the previously granted parole and work authorization issued to noncitizens paroled \ninto the United States pursuant to parole programs for noncitizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, \nand Venezuela . . . prior to the noncitizen’s originally stated parole end date.” Doe v. Noem, No. \n1:25-cv-10495, 2025 WL 1099602, at *20 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025). On May 30, 2025, in an \nunsigned and unexplained order, the Supreme Court granted a stay of the District Court’s order \npending resolution of the Government’s appeal to the First Circuit and petition for certiorari to the \nSupreme Court. Noem v. Doe, 145 S. Ct. 1524, 1524 (2025). Thus, as of that date, the March 25 \nCHNV Termination Notice remains in full effect.  \nAll the while, DHS retains the authority to grant parole upon inspection at a port of entry \non a case-by-case basis, as well as to later terminate it. During the Biden Administration, DHS \nbegan directing noncitizens to use the CBP One mobile application as the primary, if not exclusive, \nmechanism to seek parole and/or asylum at the southwestern border. See Circumvention of Lawful \nPathways, 88 Fed. Reg. 31314, 31317–18. (May 16, 2023). The Trump Administration disabled \nthat functionality in CBP One in January 2025 and terminated all grants of parole authorized \nthrough that application in April 2025. Valerie Gonzalez, Trump’s DHS Revokes Legal Status for \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 18 of 84\nMigrants Who Entered the US on Biden-Era CBP One App (Apr. 8, 2025), https://perma.cc/FX74-\nBN5Z; see also Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Six Months of Keeping America Safe Under President \nTrump  and  Secretary  Noem  (July  20,  2025),  https://perma.cc/7Z6X-328H  (“President \nTrump ended the CBP One app that allowed more than one million aliens to illegally enter the \nU.S.”). \n3.  Relevant Avenues of Immigration Relief \nImmigration law supplies a few relevant avenues under which noncitizens who arrive in \nthe United States without entry documents can gain lawful admission (as distinct from parole, \nwhich is not admission). First, pursuant to statute and treaties, the United States offers asylum to \na  set  number  of  noncitizens  per  year  whom  DHS  deems  to  be  “refugee[s].”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1158(b)(1)(A). To qualify as a refugee, a noncitizen must show that they are “unable or unwilling \nto return to, and . . . unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, [the last \ncountry in which they habitually resided] because of persecution or a well-founded fear of \npersecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or \npolitical opinion.” Id. § 1101(a)(42). In section 240 proceedings, the IJ can make that assessment \nand grant or deny asylum to the noncitizen. 8 C.F.R. § 208.14(a). Alternatively, an asylum officer \nwithin USCIS can grant or deny asylum. Id. § 208.14(b). In expedited removal, noncitizens must \nfirst establish a “credible fear” of such persecution to the satisfaction of an asylum officer, who \nthen refers them to proceedings in immigration court to prove that they meet the higher standard \nof “well-founded fear” necessary to claim asylum status. See id. § 235.3(b)(4); id. § 208.30.  \nSecond,  noncitizens  who  were  admitted  or  paroled  into  the  United  States  can  seek \n“adjustment of status,” granting them lawful permanent resident status, on a variety of bases. 8 \nU.S.C. § 1255. For instance, the noncitizen or their spouse may seek the noncitizen’s adjustment \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 19 of 84\nof status if the spouse is a U.S. citizen. See id. § 1154(a)(1)(A). Parents and children of U.S. \ncitizens may do the same. See id. So may noncitizens who were victims of human trafficking, id. \n§ 1255(l), victims of crimes against women, id. § 1255(m), or juveniles abused or abandoned by \ntheir parents, id. § 1101(a)(27)(J), § 1255(g). So, too, may Cuban natives or citizens who were \ninspected and admitted or paroled at a port of entry and have been physically present in the United \nStates for at least one year. 8 U.S.C. § 1255 note. \nNoncitizens may pursue some of those forms of relief in section 240 proceedings, but most \ncan be obtained only through separate applications to USCIS or another entity. ECF 22-6 ¶ 9. In \nsection 240 proceedings, noncitizens typically have time to pursue such collateral relief through \nUSCIS. Id. ¶¶ 9–10. Not so in expedited removal proceedings. Indeed, none of those forms of \nrelief is available to noncitizens in expedited removal unless they manage to establish credible fear \nand get transferred back to section 240 proceedings. Id. ¶ 17. \nB.  Factual Background  \n1.  The Challenged Actions \nAgainst that statutory and regulatory backdrop, DHS took three actions during the first two \nmonths  of  the  second  Trump  Administration  to  subject  a  significantly  greater  number  of \nnoncitizens to expedited removal. Plaintiffs here challenge each one. \n \ni.  The January 23 Huffman Memorandum \n  On January 23, 2025, Acting Secretary of DHS Benjamine Huffman issued a memorandum \nto the leadership of USCIS and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) “provid[ing] guidance \nregarding how to exercise enforcement discretion in implementing” two “policies” that he had \nannounced in the days prior. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Memorandum from Acting Secretary \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 20 of 84\nBenjamine C. Huffman on Guidance Regarding How to Exercise Enforcement Discretion (Jan. 23, \n2025), https://perma.cc/4HPX-45Z7 [hereinafter January 23 Huffman Memorandum]. The first of \nthe two “policies” was a January 20 memorandum “clarif[ying] DHS’s position regarding the \nscope of the parole statute” and authorizing DHS components to “pause, modify, or terminate, \neffective immediately, any parole program . . . inconsistent with” that memorandum. Id. at 1. The \nsecond was the 2025 Designation Notice rescinding the 2022 Recission Notice and returning \nDHS’s assertion of expedited removal authority to the full scope of the Designation Provision. Id.  \nThe  January  23  Huffman  Memorandum  “direct[ed]”  USCIS  and  CBP  officials  to \n“consider” placing in expedited removal “any alien DHS is aware of who is amenable to expedited \nremoval but to whom expedited removal has not been applied.” Id. at 2. The Memorandum \nindicated that applying expedited removal “may include steps to terminate any ongoing removal \nproceeding and/or active parole status.” Id.  \nThe January 23 Huffman Memorandum also included a few qualifiers to its directives. For \none, it repeatedly emphasized that the instructions were to be understood as “consistent with the \nprinciples of enforcement discretion”—namely, that “‘[t]he Executive  Branch has exclusive \nauthority and absolute discretion to decide whether to prosecute a case,’” including in immigration \nenforcement. Id. at 1–2 (quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693 (1974)). In addition, \nthe Memorandum stated that “actions contemplated by” it “shall be taken in a manner consistent \nwith applicable statutes, regulations, and court orders,” as well as “in a manner that takes account \nof legitimate reliance interests.”  Id. at 2.  \nii.  The February 18 ICE Directive \n  On February 18, 2025, ICE leadership issued an internal directive to its Enforcement and \nRemoval Operations (ERO) personnel directing them to “consider for expedited removal” a \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 21 of 84\ndifferent set of categories of noncitizens (the “February 18 ICE Directive”).13 The one relevant to \nPlaintiffs’ members here, “paroled arriving aliens,” it described as “any arriving alien (i.e., \nencountered at a port of entry) who CBP determined to be inadmissible and released, as long as \nthe alien is inadmissible under” the two inadmissibility criteria to which expedited removal applies \n(i.e., lack of valid immigration documents or fraud or willful misrepresentation). February 18 ICE \nDirective at 1. For that category, the Directive explained, “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to \nprocess such aliens for [expedited removal].” Id. That Directive included no similar discussion of \nenforcement discretion, or reference to legality or reliance interests, as the January 23 Huffman \nMemorandum did. \niii.  The March 25 CHNV Termination Notice \n  As discussed above, on March 25, 2025, DHS terminated the CHNV Parole Programs \ninstituted in 2022 and 2023. See supra Section II.A.2. And after a stay by another district court, \nthe March 25 CHNV Termination Notice remains back in effect as of May 30, 2025, pursuant to \nthe Supreme Court’s emergency order.  \n  As relevant here, the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice terminated parole for hundreds \nof thousands of noncitizens for the express purpose of subjecting them to expedited removal when \nthey otherwise would not be. In justifying the parole terminations, DHS relied in large part on “the \nU.S. government’s strong interest in promptly removing parolees when the basis for the underlying \nprogram no longer exists.” March 25 CHNV Termination Notice at 13619. Termination of the \nparole programs was necessary, the Notice continued, because “[e]xpedited removal is available \n \n13 DHS has not published this directive; instead, it was reported by Reuters in early March 2025. See Ted Hesson & \nKristina Cooke, Trump Weighs Revoking Legal Status of Ukrainians as US Steps Up Deportations, Reuters (March 6, \n2025), https://perma.cc/MT7S-MR4Y (citing “internal ICE email” available at https://perma.cc/S3LJ-AFJM). This \nopinion refers to this document, as published by Reuters, as the February 18 ICE Directive. Defendants do not dispute \nthe authenticity of this document, and their argument proceeds on the basis that it is authentic. See, e.g., ECF 26 at 51. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 22 of 84\nonly when an alien has not been continuously present in the United States for at least the two years \npreceding the date of the inadmissibility determination.” Id. (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(iii)(II); \n8 CFR § 235.3). If DHS did not terminate the CHNV Parole Programs and instead had to wait for \nthe grants of parole to expire at the end of their terms, “DHS would be compelled to place a greater \nproportion of this population in section 240 removal proceedings to effectuate their removal.” Id. \nThat is because, the Notice explained, “parolees may begin to accrue more than two years of \ncontinuous presence in the United States,” disqualifying them from expedited removal under the \nDesignation Provision and therefore requiring “section 240 removal proceedings” as the only way \nto remove them. Id. at 13620. \n  Like the February 18 ICE Directive, and unlike the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, \nthis Notice also contained no qualification about compliance with applicable law. It did state that \nit was being issued in response to an Executive Order that directed DHS to “take all appropriate \naction,” “consistent with applicable law,” to terminate the CHNV Parole Programs. Id. at 13611. \n(quoting Exec. Order 14165, 90 Fed. Reg. 8467, 8468 (Jan. 20, 2025)). But the Notice did not \nqualify its own actions with that or any similar language. \n2.  Plaintiffs \nPlaintiffs  here  are  three  membership  organizations  whose  members  include  parolees \nsubject to, and in many cases already undergoing, expedited removal under one or more of the \nthree Challenged Actions.  \nPlaintiff Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”) is a nonprofit organization \nheadquartered in Los Angeles with offices throughout California and in Washington, D.C. ECF \n22-3 ¶ 2. CHIRLA is “the largest statewide immigrant rights organization in California,” with \napproximately 51,297 members across the state. Id. ¶¶ 4–5. Many of CHIRLA’s members were \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 23 of 84\ngranted parole via either the CBP One app or the CHNV Parole Programs and are now subject to \nexpedited removal under the Challenged Actions. Id. ¶ 15. One CHIRLA member, for instance, \nwas arrested at a CBP checkpoint on March 7, 2025, despite having active parole, and is now being \nprocessed for expedited removal. Id. ¶ 17.  \nPlaintiff CASA, Inc. (“CASA”) is a national nonprofit organization with more than \n173,000 members across the United States, most of whom are noncitizens. ECF 22-2 ¶ 1. Of those, \nmore than 33,000 “entered the United States after the CBP One app first launched in October \n2020,” and “a significant portion of those members were likely granted parole through CBP One,” \naccording to the organization. Id. ¶ 11. In addition, about 2,250 CASA members are nationals of \nCuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, or Venezuela and entered the United States after full implementation of \nthe CHNV Parole Programs in January 2023. Id. ¶ 12. Thus, “[a] significant number of them were \nlikely sponsored for and granted parole through CHNV parole.” Id. As of the Supreme Court’s \ntermination of the district court’s stay of the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice, they are now \nin the Government’s view eligible for expedited removal—and some members have received \nletters terminating their parole status and “directing them to leave the country.” Id. They now may \nbe detained and put into expedited removal at any point, including at their section 240 removal \nhearings, which have been a primary site of the ramp-up in immigration enforcement in recent \nweeks. Id. ¶ 13. And they face adverse consequences for themselves and their families if they are \nremoved without a full chance to prove asylum eligibility or eligibility for other relief, including \nrisks of persecution or worse in their country of origin. See id. ¶¶ 16–19. \nFinally, Plaintiff UndocuBlack Network (“UndocuBlack”) is a membership organization \nwith more than 1,000 active members—all of whom are immigrants and identify as Black—across \nNew York, Los Angeles, and Washington, D.C. ECF 22-4 ¶¶ 1, 7–8. Among those are at least 300 \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 24 of 84\nHaitian nationals who were paroled into the United States through either the CHNV Parole \nPrograms or the CBP One app. Id. ¶ 11. UndocuBlack’s members, too, run the risk of detention \nand expedited removal at immigration courthouses, where they must report for their section 240 \nhearings, and of losing the opportunity to gain collateral immigration relief if they are detained \nbefore they can do so. Id. ¶¶ 13–15. UndocuBlack’s members face family separation, as well as \n“extreme danger,” if forced to return to Haiti. Id. ¶ 22.  \n3.  This Suit \nPlaintiffs filed a complaint in this Court on March 24, 2025, alleging that the Challenged \nActions exceeded DHS’s statutory authority under IIRAIRA and the Administrative Procedure \nAct (APA), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C); was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, id. \n§ 706(2)(A); and violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. ECF 1 ¶¶ 102–115. \nPlaintiffs sued DHS Secretary Kristi Noem; ICE, CBP, and USCIS officials Todd Lyons, Pete \nFlores, and Kika Scott; and President Donald Trump, all in their official capacities (collectively, \nDefendants). Id. at 1. On June 11, 2025, Plaintiffs amended their complaint and added two more \ncauses of action: a claim that the January 23 Huffman Memorandum and CHNV Termination \nNotice violated the rule of United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954), that \nagencies must comply with their own regulations, ECF 21 ¶¶ 163–170; and a claim that the 1997 \nDHS regulation codified at 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 defining “arriving alien” exceeded the agency’s statutory \nauthority under IIRAIRA and the APA, id. ¶¶ 171–183. \nThat same day, June 11, Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay agency action, under 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705, as to the three Challenged Actions (but not 8 C.F.R. § 1.2) “insofar as they subject \nindividuals who have been previously granted parole at ports of entry to expedited removal.” ECF \n22 at 1; see ECF 28 at 23 n.12 (explaining that “Plaintiffs challenge 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 as ultra \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 25 of 84\nvires . . . but have not moved for preliminary relief as to it”). For purposes of their stay motion, \nPlaintiffs also do not advance their Due Process claim, instead limiting their argument to claims \nthat the Challenged Actions are ultra vires and arbitrary and capricious. See ECF 22-1 at 22. In \ntheir motion, Plaintiffs submit evidence that expedited removals of their members and others in \ntheir communities had ramped up in the weeks prior—particularly since the March 25 CHNV \nTermination went back into effect in May 2025—and that they therefore faced widespread actual \nor imminent irreparable harm. ECF 22 at 1; ECF 22-1 at 15–16; ECF 22-3 ¶ 21; ECF 22-4 ¶ 13.14 \nDefendants filed an opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay, ECF 26, and Plaintiffs \nreplied, ECF 28. The Court heard oral argument on the motion on July 9, 2025. See July 9, 2025 \nMin. Entry. \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nSection 705 of the APA authorizes courts to “issue all necessary and appropriate process \nto postpone the effective date of an agency action or to preserve status or rights pending conclusion \nof the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. The court may do so “[o]n such conditions as may be \nrequired and to the extent necessary to prevent irreparable injury.” Id.  \nThe factors governing issuance of a section 705 stay are the same as those that govern the \ngrant of a preliminary injunction. Dist. of Columbia v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d 1, 15 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (citing, inter alia, Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C. \nCir. 1985)). To prevail on such a motion, the movant “must show (1) a substantial likelihood of \n \n14 This increase in expedited removals also coincided, according to Plaintiffs, with a May 20, 2025, directive from \nSecretary Noem and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller telling ICE officials to increase immigration \narrests to 3,000 per day—triple the status quo. ECF 22-1 at 15. That is consistent with Plaintiffs’ argument, addressed \nfurther below, that the Challenged Actions caused the increase in expedited removals. As Plaintiffs’ declarations \ndemonstrate, and as the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice states, DHS sees and is using expedited removal as a \nbasis to arrest and detain immigrants previously paroled from detention in section 240 removal proceedings. See, e.g., \nECF 22-2 ¶ 13; ECF 22-3 ¶¶ 14, 17; ECF 22-8 ¶ 21; ECF 22-10 ¶ 7; ECF 22-14 ¶ 8; March 25 CHNV Termination \nNotice at 13614–15 (discussing the need to increase the incentives against illegal immigration through, inter alia, \n“detention capabilities” and the problem of “releases from [U.S. Border Patrol] custody”). \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 26 of 84\nsuccess on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the [stay] were not granted, (3) \nthat a[] [stay] would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that the public interest \nwould be furthered by the [stay].” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, \n297 (D.C. Cir. 2006). In a case like this one, where the Government is the non-movant, the third \nand fourth factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nIn this section, the Court assesses each of those four factors in turn to decide whether a stay \nunder section 705 is warranted. Because each favors granting a stay, the Court will do so. In \naddition, this section discusses the scope of the stay the Court will order. \nA.  Plaintiffs Are Substantially Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nTo decide whether Plaintiffs are substantially likely to succeed on the merits, the Court \nmust first assess whether a “substantial likelihood of jurisdiction” exists to hear those claims. \nChurch v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 133 (D.D.C. 2021); see also Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. \nVilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015). This section answers that first question in the \naffirmative. It then finds that Plaintiffs are also substantially likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims that the Challenged Actions are both ultra vires and arbitrary and capricious.  \n1.  Jurisdictional and Other Bars Do Not Block Plaintiffs’ Requested Stay \nIIRAIRA leaves little room for noncitizens, or those suing on their behalf, to seek judicial \nrelief from expedited removal. That is by design; expedited removal’s expedition derives in no \nsmall part from its insulation from judicial review. But Congress left a clear opening for suits \nchallenging the expedited removal system’s compliance with the law. Despite Defendants’ myriad \narguments to the contrary, Plaintiffs’ suit falls squarely within that opening, as does their motion \nfor preliminary relief. Accordingly, this Court likely has jurisdiction to hear this case, and no \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 27 of 84\nconstitutional requirement or statutory provision bars this Court from granting the requested \nrelief.15   \ni.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1) Does Not Bar Relief \n  Defendants’ first volley against Plaintiffs’ suit invokes 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1)’s limitation \non injunctive relief in immigration suits. Defendants argue that, “[w]hile Plaintiffs have styled \ntheir request for relief as a stay rather than an injunction, the relief requested is the same in \nsubstance.” ECF 26 at 22. Accordingly, Defendants reason, section 1252(f)(1)’s prohibition on \nany “court (other than the Supreme Court) . . . enjoin[ing] or restrain[ing] the operation of the \nprovisions of” the section of the U.S. code at issue, including the expedited removal provisions, \nprohibits the requested relief here. Id. (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1)). Plaintiffs respond that \nsection 1252(f)(1) by its terms is “nothing more or less than a limit on injunctive relief” and that a \nstay under APA section 705 does not constitute an injunction subject to that provision. ECF 28 \nat 17 (quoting Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 481 \n(1999)).  \nPlaintiffs have the better of the argument. Although neither the Supreme Court nor the D.C. \nCircuit has addressed this question, both the Fifth Circuit and numerous district courts, including \nin this District, have held that section 1252(f)(1) does not bar a remedy of vacatur under APA \nsection 706.16 As the Fifth Circuit explained, “a vacatur does nothing but re-establish the status \nquo absent the unlawful agency action. Apart from the constitutional or statutory basis on which \n \n15 In their opposition, Defendants frame some of the issues discussed in this section as questions of “jurisdiction” and \nothers as whether section 705 provides a basis for the requested relief. See ECF 26 at 2. The Court analyzes these \nthreshold  issues together,  without  categorizing  them  as  “jurisdictional,”  “prudential,”  “claims-processing,”  or \notherwise, because those distinctions do not, at this point, matter to the Court’s resolution of the issues.  \n16 See, e.g., Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 220 (5th Cir. 2022); Las Americas Immigrant Advoc. Ctr. v. DHS, \nNo. CV 24-1702, 2025 WL 1403811, at *22 (D.D.C. May 9, 2025); Texas v. Biden, 646 F. Supp. 3d 753, 768 (N.D. \nTex. 2022); Kidd v. Mayorkas, 734 F. Supp. 3d 967, 987 (C.D. Cal. 2024); Florida v. United States, 660 F. Supp. 3d \n1239, 1284-85 (N.D. Fla. 2023); Immigrant Defs. L. Ctr. v. Mayorkas, No. CV 20-9893, 2023 WL 3149243, at *14 \n(C.D. Cal. Mar. 15, 2023). \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 28 of 84\nthe court invalidated an agency action, vacatur neither compels nor restrains further agency \ndecision-making.” Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 220 (5th Cir. 2022). A court in the \nNorthern District of Texas extended that logic to hold that § 1252(f)(1) also does not bar a stay \nunder section 705. See Texas v. Biden, 646 F. Supp. 3d 753, 768 (N.D. Tex. 2022). “Unlike an \ninjunction,” that court reasoned, “a stay [under section 705] would not ‘order federal officials to \ntake or to refrain from taking actions to enforce, implement, or otherwise carry out the specified \nstatutory provisions’ at issue,” which is all section 1252(f)(1) prohibits according to the Supreme \nCourt. Id. at 769 (quoting Garland v. Aleman Gonzalez, 596 U.S. 543, 550 (2022)). Those opinions \npersuade this Court.   \n  Defendants offer a two-fold response. First, Defendants point to a series of cases describing \nvarious forms of stays as equivalent to injunctions. But none of those cases involved, or purported \nto interpret, section 1252(f)(1) or its relationship to APA remedies. See ECF 26 at 23 (citing, for \nexample, Brown v. Gilmore, 533 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.J., in chambers), which \ndistinguished between stay of a lower court judgment and injunction against enforcement of a \npresumptively valid state statute for purposes of the All Writs Act). And Defendants fail to explain \nany analogical relevance those opinions might have. Defendants also pointed at oral argument to \nthe D.C. Circuit’s recent decision in N.S. v. Dixon, which held that section 1252(f)(1) bars \ninjunctions not just of statutory provisions of the INA or IIRAIRA but also injunctions of agency \nactions implementing the statutory provisions. 141 F.4th 279, 288–90 (D.C. Cir. 2025); see ECF \n35 at 42 (Hr’g Tr. 42:5–19). Although that case clarified a prior D.C. Circuit case on the scope of \nsection 1252(f)(1), however, it had nothing to do with vacatur or stay under the APA but rather \nwith a class-wide permanent injunction. See Dixon, 141 F.4th at 281; N.S. v. Dixon, No. 1:20-cv-\n101, 2021 WL 4622490 (D.D.C. Oct. 7, 2021), vacated and remanded, 141 F.4th 279 (D.C. Cir. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 29 of 84\n2025). Further, it relied heavily on the Supreme Court’s decision in Aleman Gonzalez, a decision \nthat is consistent with the analysis above and with the analysis in cases like Texas v. Biden. 646 F. \nSupp. 3d at 769. \nSecond, Defendants invoke IIRAIRA’s legislative history, in which a House Report \ndescribed the purpose of section 1252(f)(1) as ensuring that, in challenges to procedures under the \nAct, “the procedures w[ould] remain in force while such lawsuits are pending.” ECF 26 at 25 \n(quoting H.R. Rep. 104-469, at 161 (1996)). On its face, that statement supports Defendants’ \nposition. But it is difficult to square with the unanimous view of the caselaw on section 1252(f)(1), \nincluding the Supreme Court’s statement that the section effects “nothing more or less than a limit \non injunctive relief.” AADC, 525 U.S. at 481. In addition, Defendants’ interpretation presents a \nstructural problem: it would leave associational plaintiffs like those in this case without any \nremedy when suing in this Court, despite the statute’s clear grant of jurisdiction for suits in this \nCourt under section 1252(e). The D.C. Circuit has held that section 1252(e)(3) authorizes suits by \nassociations to “prosecute a case on behalf of individuals directly regulated and affected by” an \nagency action challengeable under that provision. Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 627–28. And suits \nunder section 1252(e)(3) must be brought “in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). If the statute authorizes suits by associations in this Court, \nbut authorizes no relief for anyone besides “an individual alien” that looks anything like an \ninjunction, stay, or vacatur, id. § 1252(f)(1), then what relief could this Court grant?  \nWhen pressed on this question at oral argument, Defendants came up empty. First, they \ninsisted that only an individual noncitizen could seek relief under section 1252(e)(3)(A) without \nhitting up against the bar of section 1252(f)(1). ECF 35 at 44 (Hr’g Tr. 44:9–12). But when \nconfronted with the binding precedent on associational standing in Make the Road, Defendants \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 30 of 84\nclaimed that in such a case “there is no remedy that the Court can provide.” Id. at 45 (Hr’g Tr. \n45:22–23). A bizarre result. When pressed further still, Defendants assured the Court that it could \nstill “adjudicate the merits” of the dispute, just not “issue any relief,” including declaratory relief. \nId. at 46–47 (Hr’g Tr. 46:18–47:22). And a Party could then, the Court supposes under Defendants’ \ntheory, appeal the merits decision until it reached the Supreme Court, at which point that Court \ncould issue an injunction under section 1252(f)(1). Even more bizarre. The Court declines to give \nthe statute such an absurd meaning based on a single sentence in the legislative history. See United \nStates v. Cook, 594 F.3d 883, 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (“A statutory outcome is absurd if it defies \nrationality by rendering a statute nonsensical or superfluous . . . .” (cleaned up)).  \nThe final problem with Defendants’ legislative history argument is that their quote from \nthe House Report does not match up to the statute’s text. The legislative history appears to envision \nthat section 1252(f)(1) would prevent preliminary relief of any kind. See H.R. Rep. 104-469, at \n161 (1996) (discussing what happens while challenges to expedited removal procedures “are \npending”). The statute’s text, though, prohibits all orders that “enjoin or restrain the operation of” \nthe statute’s provisions, not just preliminary ones. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f)(1). In short, because the \nstatute’s text, alongside the D.C. Circuit’s interpretation of it, does not permit Defendants’ reading, \nthe Court will not give it that reading based on the legislative history alone. See Int’l Bhd. of Elec. \nWorkers, Loc. Union No. 474, AFL-CIO v. N.L.R.B., 814 F.2d 697, 699–700 (D.C. Cir. 1987) \n(“Although legislative history may give meaning to ambiguous statutory provisions, courts have \nno authority to enforce alleged principles gleaned solely from legislative history that has no \nstatutory reference point.” (emphasis in original)). \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 31 of 84\nii.  APA Section 705 Permits Stays of Agency Actions Already in Effect \n  In their next attack on the relief Plaintiffs seek, Defendants assert that a court may not stay \nagency actions under APA section 705 that have already gone into effect. ECF 26 at 25–28. APA \nsection 705 permits an agency to “postpone the effective date” of its own actions pending judicial \nreview  and,  separately,  permits  a  court  to  “postpone  the  effective  date  of  an agency \naction or . . . preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705. Defendants’ argument here relies on cases interpreting the term “postpone the effective \ndate” as it relates to agencies’ own stays of their agency actions. See ECF 26 at 26 (citing Safety-\nKleen Corp. v. EPA, Nos. 92-1629, 92-1639, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 2324, at *2-3 (D.C. Cir. Jan. \n19, 1996); Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Regan, No. 21-cv-119, 2022 WL 971067, at *21 (D.D.C. \nMar. 30, 2022); California v. U.S. Bureau of Land Mgmt., 277 F. Supp. 3d 1106, 1118 (N.D. Cal. \n2017)). Defendants argue that the same phrase in the same statute should be given the same \nmeaning; a court, therefore, should not be able to stay an agency action after it has gone into effect \nif an agency under the same provision cannot. Id. at 26.  \n  However, as Plaintiffs point out, Defendants’ argument omits the other authority that \nsection 705 grants only courts, not agencies. While an agency may only “postpone the effective \ndate of action taken by it,” a court may either “postpone the effective date of an agency action” or \n“preserve status or rights pending conclusion of the review proceedings.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. And \n“[c]ourts—including the Supreme Court—routinely stay already-effective agency action.” Texas \nv. Biden, 646 F. Supp. 3d at 770 (citing, e.g., W. Virginia v. E.P.A., 577 U.S. 1126 (2016)); accord \nKingdom v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-691, 2025 WL 1568238, at *5 (D.D.C. June 3, 2025) (noting that \n“various courts have interpreted  § 705 to permit a ‘stay’—which may be more aptly described as \na temporary rollback—even of already-consummated agency action”). Moreover, “[w]hile some \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 32 of 84\ncourts have held that an agency may not issue a § 705 stay for an already-effective action because \nthat would amount to an amendment requiring a period of notice and comment, that reasoning \nplainly does not apply to courts.” Cabrera v. U.S. Dep’t of Lab., No. 25-cv-1909, 2025 WL \n2092026, at *8 (D.D.C. July 25, 2025) (internal citation and emphasis omitted). Thus, the fact that \nall three Challenged Actions are already in effect does not bar this Court from staying them—and \nreturning things to the status quo ante while this case proceeds—under section 705. See Texas v. \nBiden, 646 F. Supp. 3d at 771. \niii.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(1) Does Not Prohibit the Requested Relief \n  Defendants next invoke the provision of section 1252 that prohibits courts from “enter[ing] \ndeclaratory, injunctive, or other equitable relief in any action pertaining to an order to exclude an \nalien in accordance with section 1225(b)(1) of this title [i.e., the expedited removal provision] \nexcept  as  specifically  authorized  in  a  subsequent  paragraph  of  this  subsection.”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(1)(A). Although Plaintiffs bring this suit under section 1252(e)(3), which is carved out \nof that prohibition, Defendants insist that Plaintiffs’ stay motion must fail because the sole remedy \nsection (e)(3) authorizes is a final “determination[]” on the merits—not interim relief. ECF 26 \nat 28 (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)). Further, Defendants urge, section 1252(e)(3) authorizes \nsuits “by, and only by, aliens against whom the new procedures had been applied”—not by \nassociations suing on behalf of their noncitizen members. Id. (quoting Am. Immigr. Lawyers Ass’n \nv. Reno (“AILA”), 199 F.3d 1352, 1360 (D.C. Cir. 2000)).  \n  Defendants miss on both swings. As to interim versus final relief, Plaintiffs correctly \nobserve that “section 1252(e)(3) is not addressed to remedies.” ECF 28 at 21 n.8 (quoting \nKiakombua v. Wolf, 498 F. Supp. 3d 1, 51 (D.D.C. 2020) (K.B. Jackson, J.)). Instead, its use of the \nterm “determinations” refers to determination of “certain legal issues, including whether the \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 33 of 84\n[challenged] written policy directive, guideline, or procedure is consistent with the [statute].” \nKiakombua, 498 F. Supp. 3d at 51 (citing 8 U.S.C § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii)) (emphasis in original). That \nis clear from the text of section 1252(e)(3), which nowhere mentions remedies but clearly describes \nlegal grounds for suit. And with regard to suits by associations, Defendants’ argument blinks the \nD.C. Circuit’s holding in Make the Road. There, the Circuit rejected the very argument that the \nGovernment makes here, holding instead that associations can bring suit under § 1252(e) on behalf \nof their members. See Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 627–28 (explaining that AILA, the Government’s \nprimary case there and here, “rejected third-party organizational standing” but “did not address \nassociational standing,” and that associational suits, unlike organizational suits, “seek[] to remedy \nthe individual members’ injuries”). The caselaw thus forecloses Defendants’ position. \niv.  Plaintiffs’ Asserted Injuries Are Redressable \n  Moving to standing, Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries to their \nmembers—but they do challenge those injuries’ redressability by this suit. ECF 26 at 31.17 \nAccording to Defendants, Plaintiffs’ members’ injuries are not redressable because a regulatory \nprovision that has been in place since 1997 and that Plaintiffs do not seek to stay in this motion \nalready “allows DHS to apply expedited removal to aliens paroled at ports of entry.” Id. at 29. \nSpecifically, Defendants cite 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(i), which authorizes application of expedited \nremoval to “[a]rriving aliens,” and 8 C.F.R. § 1.2, which defines “arriving alien[s]” to include \nthose who are “paroled . . . and even after any such parole is terminated or revoked.” Based on \nthese longstanding regulations, Defendants reason, DHS could already do exactly what Plaintiffs \nallege they are doing here, and thus Plaintiffs’ injuries are “in no way contingent on” the \n \n17 Defendants briefly argue that Plaintiffs have “failed to plead an injury” sufficient for organizational standing, but \nthey then acknowledge that Plaintiffs instead invoke associational standing and “do not challenge” Plaintiffs’ asserted \ninjury on that latter basis. ECF 26 at 30–31.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 34 of 84\nChallenged Actions. ECF 26 at 30. In other words, because “none of  these documents are \nnecessary for DHS to apply expedited removal to aliens paroled at a port of entry,” “staying their \nimplementation will not prevent the harms Plaintiffs allege they cause.” Id. \n  The first problem with Defendants’ argument is that it contradicts the factual record now \nbefore the Court. While DHS has long asserted the authority to apply expedited removal to \nparolees, Plaintiffs present evidence that the agency has only begun doing so en masse since the \nChallenged Actions—particularly the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice. See ECF 22-1 at 15–\n16; ECF 22-3 ¶ 21; ECF 22-4 ¶ 13; see also supra at n.13. Plaintiffs’ employees testified in \ndeclarations that expedited removal has ramped up significantly among their memberships. See id. \nAnd multiple immigration attorneys who submitted declarations in this case, each of whom has \nyears of experience representing immigrants in removal proceedings, swore that they have rarely, \nif ever, seen expedited removal applied to parolees or others already in section 240 proceedings \nbefore the past few months. See, e.g., ECF 22-8 ¶ 28; ECF 22-14 ¶ 14.  \nDefendants do little to rebut that evidence. They first point to a memorandum issued by an \nICE official in April 2011 instructing agents to “screen incarcerated aliens to determine if \n[expedited removal] is appropriate,” including whether they qualify as an “arriving alien” under \nthe regulation. ECF 36-1 at 2–3 (Memorandum from Gary Mead, ICE Executive Associate \nDirector, to Field Officer Directors and Deputy Field Office Directors (Apr. 5, 2011)). Second, \nthey refer the Court to two cases initiated prior to January 2025 in which DHS applied expedited \nremoval to parolees. See ECF 36 at 2 (citing Cordon-Linarez v. Garland, No. 3:24-CV-00488, \n2024 WL 4652824, at *1 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 1, 2024), appeal pending, No. 24-3068 (3d Cir.); United \nStates v. Arredondo-Martinez, No. CR 10-525, 2011 WL 13196331, at *6 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 3, 2011), \naff’d 492 F. App’x 823 (9th Cir. 2012)).  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 35 of 84\nThat scant evidence does not overcome the record Plaintiffs have developed. For one thing, \nthe 2011 memorandum proves only that ICE officials considered and encouraged using their \nasserted authority under the “arriving alien” regulatory definition. Defendants offer no evidence \nof how often or how pervasively ICE officials actually used that authority. Indeed, Defendants did \nnot even offer this memorandum in their initial briefing; instead, they submitted it after this Court’s \nquestions at oral argument as to any examples of DHS applying expedited removal to parolees \nbefore this year. See id. at 1. That Defendants could then muster just two examples of the agency \napplying that regulatory definition to specific noncitizens prior to 2025 only highlights the dearth \nof evidence. Further, in both of Defendants’ cited cases, the noncitizens were charged with crimes \nand paroled into the country for purposes of criminal prosecution. See Cordon-Linarez, 2024 WL \n4652824,  at  *4;  Arrendondo-Martinez,  2011  WL  13196331,  at  *1.  Additionally,  the  2011 \nmemorandum contained separate directives for noncitizens paroled into the United States for \nprosecution  versus  those  paroled  for  another  reason.  It  said  that  ICE  officers  “should  use \n[expedited removal] for all arriving aliens paroled into the United States for prosecution, regardless \nof how long they have been present in the United States,” but should only consider expedited \nremoval for other parolees “if the parole has expired or been terminated and the alien has been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than one year.” ECF 36-1 at 3. Thus, Defendants \nprovide no evidence that, prior to the Challenged Actions, DHS ever applied expedited removal to \nthe many parolees—including the hundreds of thousands of parolees under the CHNV Parole \nPrograms and others like them—who were paroled into the United States for a purpose other than \ncriminal prosecution. And they certainly have no evidence that DHS applied expedited removal to \nthat population at the scale it is doing so now. Plaintiffs’ evidence, then, stands unrebutted. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 36 of 84\nMeanwhile, Defendants’ own statements elsewhere in their briefing flatly contradict what \nis left of their redressability argument. Although Defendants insist for redressability purposes that \nthey could do the exact same things they are doing here, and inflict the exact same injuries, even \nif the Court stayed the Challenged Actions, they assert for balance-of-the-equities purposes that \n“[t]he relief Plaintiffs request would prevent DHS from applying expedited removal to potentially \nhundreds of thousands of paroled aliens whose parole DHS is seeking to revoke or has revoked, \nthereby frustrating DHS’s ability to quickly remove these aliens.” ECF 26 at 61. That could only \nbe true if DHS was not, in fact, already equipped to apply expedited removal to parolees without \nreliance on the Challenged Actions. Needless to say, Defendants cannot have it both ways. And \nDefendants’ latter argument, that the Challenged Actions have some independent effect, matches \nthe factual record. Indeed, at least one of the three Challenged Actions appears to be based on, and \npurports to implement, the “arriving alien” definition in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. See February 18 ICE \nDirective at 1 (suggesting that ICE agents may commence expedited removal proceedings for \nnoncitizens whose parole was terminated regardless of how long they have been present in the \nUnited States, which matches the Arriving Aliens Provision but not the Designation Provision). \nThat evidence, too, undermines any claim that the Challenged Actions are entirely redundant.18 \nThat record decides this question because redressability is ultimately a question of fact. \nThis Court must examine the whole record and determine whether Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries are \n“likely to be redressed” by a favorable decision. Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016). \nDefendants’ cited cases only reinforce that point. In each of the cases Defendants cite, the courts \n \n18 Ironically, the main evidence in the record in favor of Defendants’ position is a filing Plaintiffs attach to their Reply, \nwhich shows that, in at least one case, DHS has explicitly relied upon the Arriving Aliens Provision rather than the \nDesignation Provision to subject a parolee to expedited removal in recent months. See ECF 28-1 at 18. But such a \nposition is fully consistent with the proposition that the February 18 ICE Directive implemented 8 C.F.R. §§ 1.2 and \n235.3, thereby having some independent effect. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 37 of 84\nfound no redressability based on factual findings that the alternative legal route for the agency to \ndo the same thing would necessarily, or at least likely, cause the exact same injury to the plaintiffs. \nIn Texas v. EPA, the statute was “self-executing,” and therefore would have exactly the same effect \nwith or without the challenged regulations. 726 F.3d 180, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2013). In Kaspersky Lab, \nInc. v. DHS, the court found that another regulation would “independently produce the same \nalleged result.” 311 F. Supp. 3d 187, 219 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d, 909 F.3d 446 (D.C. Cir. 2018). So, \ntoo, in Delta Const. Co., Inc. v. EPA. See 783 F.3d 1291, 1297 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (“Because a separate \naction—NHTSA’s standards—independently causes the same alleged harm as the challenged \naction, the California Petitioners are unable to establish the ‘necessary causal connection’ between \nthe EPA standards and their purported injury.”). Here, Defendants have not demonstrated, as a \nfactual matter, that 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 would have the same result had none of the three Challenged \nActions been issued. Moreover, relief need only be likely to relieve the asserted injury “in part,” \nnot even the entirety of the injury. Defs. of Wildlife v. Gutierrez, 532 F.3d 913, 925 (D.C. Cir. \n2008); see also Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. 228, 243 n.15 (1982) (“[A] plaintiff satisfies the \nredressability requirement when he shows that a favorable decision will relieve a discrete injury \nto himself. He need not show that a favorable decision will relieve his every injury.” (emphasis \noriginal)). The factual record allows Plaintiffs to clear at least that bar. \n  Finally, Defendants attempt to fall back on a non-binding, and ultimately inapposite, \nconcurrence by Justice Gorsuch in United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 689–93 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). There, the Justice (joined by Justices Thomas and Barrett) argued that the States’ \nalleged injury arising from DHS guidance instructing non-enforcement against certain noncitizens \nwas not redressable by vacatur of that guidance because immigration officers would still have \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 38 of 84\nprosecutorial discretion not to arrest and remove any given noncitizen even without the challenged \nguidance. Id. at 690–91.  \nOf course, a three-Justice concurrence is not the law. Moreover, binding Supreme Court \nprecedent holds that “a litigant to whom Congress has accorded a procedural right to protect his \nconcrete  interests . . . can  assert  that  right  without  meeting  all  the  normal  standards  for \nredressability and immediacy.” Massachusetts v. EPA., 549 U.S. 497, 517–18 (2007) (internal \ncitations and quotation marks omitted). Here, Congress has specifically permitted challenges to \nany “written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure” that implements the \nexpedited removal system. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). By definition, such documents implement some \nother regulatory or statutory authority. See Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. McCarthy, 758 F.3d 243, 252 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (“An agency action that merely explains how the agency will enforce a statute or \nregulation—in other words, how it will exercise its broad enforcement discretion or permitting \ndiscretion under some extant statute or rule—is a general statement of policy,” also known as \n“guidance”). The statute thus permits procedural challenges to, and provides constitutionally \nsuitable redress from, sub-regulatory guidance that causes injury in fact. This suit meets those \ncriteria. Justice Gorsuch’s concurrence does not address that legal theory at all, much less foreclose \nit. \nv.  Plaintiffs’ Suit Is Not Time Barred \n  Next up, Defendants challenge the timeliness of Plaintiffs’ suit. The statute permitting \nchallenges, like this one, to the expedited removal system requires that such challenges be filed \n“no later than 60 days after the date the challenged section, regulation, directive, guideline, or \nprocedure . . . is first implemented.” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B). Because DHS has asserted the \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 39 of 84\nauthority to subject parolees to expedited removal since a regulation promulgated on April 1, 1997, \nDefendants contend, Plaintiffs are about 28 years too late. ECF 26 at 32.  \n  Defendants’ argument fails for the same basic reason as some of its previous ones: The \nstatute permits Plaintiffs to challenge not just statutes and agency regulations, but also “written \npolicy directive[s], written policy guideline[s], [and] written procedure[s]” that “implement” the \nexpedited removal statute. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii). In only a slight variation on their previous \narguments, Defendants contend that the Challenged Actions were not in fact “first implemented” \nwhen they were issued, id. § 1252(e)(3)(B), because they merely restated the “long-established \nprinciple that aliens paroled at a port of entry are subject to expedited removal.” ECF 26 at 33–34. \nYet,  by  its  text,  “section  1252(e)(3)  plainly  authorizes  judicial  review  of  written  policies, \nguidelines, or procedures that implement the expedited removal statute, without regard to whether \nsuch policies deviate substantively from an agency’s prior practices.” Kiakombua, 498 F. Supp. \n3d at 36. Indeed, as already explained, sub-regulatory guidance necessarily implements statutory \nor regulatory principles. If no such guidance could be challenged, most of section 1252(e)(3)A)(ii) \nwould be rendered nugatory. But courts “presume that Congress did not ‘include words [in \nstatutes] that have no effect.’” Mercy Hosp., Inc. v. Azar, 891 F.3d 1062, 1068 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(quoting Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 176–\n77 (2012)); accord United States v. Menasche, 348 U.S. 528, 538–39 (1955) (“It is our duty to \ngive effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.” (internal quotations omitted)). \nMoreover, as demonstrated above, the Challenged Actions have had effects independent of the \npreexisting 1997 regulation and cannot be understood merely to restate that regulation. See supra \nSection IV.A.1.iv. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 40 of 84\n  Plaintiffs brought this suit within 60 days of the first Challenged Action, the January 23 \nHuffman Memorandum. Their suit is therefore timely under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B).  \nvi.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) Does Not Foreclose the Requested Stay \n  Proceeding  down  the  page  of  the  U.S.  Code,  Defendants  invoke  section  1252(g)’s \n“[e]xclusive jurisdiction” provision, which states in relevant part, \nExcept as provided in this section . . . no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any \ncause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by \nthe Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate  cases, or execute \nremoval orders against any alien under this chapter. \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g). Defendants argue that Plaintiffs’ suit seeks just that prohibited kind of relief, \npointing to a prayer for relief in Plaintiffs’ amended complaint that asks the Court to “[e]njoin \nDefendants from applying expedited removal to noncitizens who have previously been granted \nparole at a port of entry.” ECF 26 at 35 (quoting ECF 21 at 54). \n  Not so. Defendants’ argument breezes right past the first five words of that provision—\n“[e]xcept  as  provided  in  this  section.”  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(g).  That  “section”  includes  section \n1252(e)(3)(A), which authorizes challenges to expedited removal policies and procedures of the \nexact kind that Plaintiffs bring here. The provision’s text thereby fully resolves the issue. \n  Defendants attempt to get out from under that text by accusing Plaintiffs of merely \n“restyl[ing]”  their  challenge  to  their  members’  expedited  removals  in  a  way  that  is  easily \nmanipulable and would render section 1252(g) a “paper tiger.” ECF 26 at 37 (quoting Tazu v. Att’y \nGen. United States, 975 F.3d 292, 298 (3d Cir. 2020); E.F.L. v. Prim, 986 F.3d 959, 965 (7th Cir. \n2021)). Yet none of the three cases Defendants cite for that proposition purported to analyze the \nline between section 1252(e)(3) actions and those barred by section 1252(g). Instead, they all \ninvolved actions that clearly did not fall under section 1252(e)(3). See Tazu, 975 F.3d at 295–98 \n(challenging the timing of DHS decision to execute plaintiff’s removal); E.F.L., 986 F.3d at 964–\n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 41 of 84\n65  (challenging  DHS  decision  to  execute  plaintiff’s  removal  order  while  plaintiff  sought \nadministrative relief); AADC, 525 U.S. at 487 (selective prosecution challenge, which the Parties \nthere appeared to agree did not fall under section 1252(e)(3)(A)). Thus, Defendants’ arguments on \nthis provision fail. \nvii.  Plaintiffs Have Prudential Standing to Sue Under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) \n  The final threshold barrier that Defendants seek to erect is a claim that Plaintiffs fall outside \nthe zone of interests protected by section 1252(e)(3) and therefore lack a cause of action to sue \nunder it. ECF 26 at 37; see Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, 562 U.S. 170, 177 (2011) (holding that \na plaintiff “may not sue unless he falls within the zone of interests sought to be protected by the \nstatutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his complaint” (internal quotations \nomitted)). Defendants point to language in the D.C. Circuit’s decision in AILA stating that the \nCircuit  “cannot  see  anything  in  these  provisions  allowing  litigants—whether  individuals  or \norganizations—to raise claims on behalf of those not party to the lawsuit.” 199 F.3d at 1358. Only \n“individual aliens who . . . were aggrieved by the statute’s implementation,” the AILA court \nreasoned, may sue under section 1252(e)(3)(A). Id. at 1359. \n  Once again, though, Defendants’ argument runs headlong into the D.C. Circuit’s later \ndecision in Make the Road, 962 F.3d 612. There, the Circuit permitted a suit under section \n1252(e)(3)(A) by membership associations because “[w]hether aggrieved individuals sue on their \nown or band together through a representative association does not change the nature of the lawsuit \nas seeking to remedy the individual members’ injuries.” Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 628. Here, \nPlaintiffs’ members are aggrieved by the Challenged Actions. Plaintiffs sue to redress those \nmembers’ injuries. See ECF 22-2; ECF 22-3; ECF 22-4. That takes this case out of the AILA \ncategory and places it firmly under Make the Road. Indeed, judges in this District have found that \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 42 of 84\nmembership associations fall within the zone of interest of this statute on precisely that basis. See, \ne.g., Nat’l Ass’n for the Advancement of Colored People v. Trump, 298 F. Supp. 3d 209, 235 \n(D.D.C. 2018), adhered to on denial of reconsideration, 315 F. Supp. 3d 457 (D.D.C. 2018), and \naff'd and remanded sub nom. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 140 S. \nCt. 1891 (2020); Hisp. Affs. Project v. Perez, 319 F.R.D. 3, 7–8 (D.D.C. 2016).19 \n  Defendants try to distinguish Make the Road on factual grounds, arguing that Plaintiffs’ \ndeclarations do not sufficiently prove that their members are aggrieved by the Challenged Actions \nin the way the Make the Road plaintiffs’ declarations did. Plaintiffs’ declarations are deficient, \nDefendants posit, because they (a) do not come from the members themselves, (b) contain hearsay, \n(c) do not identify members by their full names, and (d) sometimes do not identify whether the \nnoncitizen being discussed is a member of any of the Plaintiff associations. ECF 26 at 39. It is true \nthat the record in Make the Road included “three declarations from the Associations’ members \nstating that they were subject to and adversely affected by” the challenged expedited removal \npolicy. Make the Rd., 962 F.3d at 622. But Plaintiffs’ declarations here similarly attest to harms \nPlaintiffs’ members face from being newly subjected to expedited removal, including those \ncurrently in expedited removal proceedings or eligible for them. See, e.g., ECF 22-2 ¶¶ 10–17; \nECF 22-3 ¶¶ 14–23; ECF 22-4 ¶¶ 13–22. Make the Road imposes no requirement that the \ndeclarations identify members by their actual names. Nor does it require declarations from \nmembers themselves; declarations from others speaking about the members’ circumstances based \non the declarant’s personal knowledge and observations serve the equivalent function.20 And \n \n19 Justice O’Connor’s decision in chambers in INS v. Legalization Assistance Project of L.A. Cty. Fed’n of Labor, 510 \nU.S. 1301, 1302 (1993), does not hold to the contrary. Although her opinion did say that the immigration law at issue \nthere was “clearly meant to protect the interests of undocumented aliens, not the interests of organizations,” she \nspecifically clarified that “membership organizations which have members whose claims are ripe” could sue “on \nbehalf of those members.” Id. at 1305–06. \n20 To be sure, some portions of some of Plaintiffs’ declarations do include hearsay. The Court does not rely on any \nhearsay in the declarations. \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 43 of 84\nthough a few of the declarations fail to identify whether certain described noncitizens are members, \nthe record as a whole contains enough (non-hearsay) testimony about members of each Plaintiff \nassociation to demonstrate their standing.21 Thus, Plaintiffs stand in the same position as those in \nMake the Road. \n  Defendants make one last ditch effort to get out from under that binding precedent by \npointing to the Supreme Court’s opinion in United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670 (2023). According \nto Defendants, that case decided that “third parties have no cognizable interest in the way the \nExecutive enforces the immigration laws against others.” ECF 26 at 41. But such a statement reads \nthe Court’s decision way too broadly. United States v. Texas was a decision about Article III \nstanding in which the Supreme Court found that a state lacked a judicially cognizable injury in fact \narising from the federal government’s decision not to arrest or prosecute certain noncitizens. As \nthe Supreme Court explained, that “case raise[d] only the narrow Article III standing question of \nwhether the Federal Judiciary may in effect order the Executive Branch to take enforcement actions \nagainst violators of federal law—here, by making more arrests.” 599 U.S. at 684–85. The instant \ncase presents no such question, nor anything particularly close to it. Texas therefore does nothing \n \n21 See, e.g., ECF 22-2 ¶ 11 (discussing CASA declarant’s knowledge about “CASA members who have had their \ngrants of CBP One parole prematurely terminated, putting them at risk of being subjected to expedited removal); ECF \n22-3 ¶ 17 (discussing CHIRLA declarant’s knowledge about a CHIRLA member’s experience being detained and \nprocessed for expedited removal); ECF 22-4 ¶ 17 (discussing UndocuBlack declarant’s knowledge of its “members \nwho are Haitian parole beneficiaries” and are newly eligible for removal due to the Challenged Actions, and who \ntherefore face the heightened risk of “abrupt family separation,” and “deport[ation] to Haiti where they don’t have \nfamily or resources and where they may be at risk of violence or even death”); ECF 22-10 (discussing CASA member’s \nexperience in the expedited removal process based on the member’s attorney’s personal knowledge and observations). \nDefendants also seem to suggest that the only declarations that can support Plaintiffs’ prudential standing are those \nfrom members who are already in expedited removal proceedings. ECF 26 at 39 (“In fact, Plaintiffs only identify three \nalleged members who were granted parole and subsequently placed in expedited removal proceedings, in each case \nthrough pseudonymous hearsay. . . . This is insufficient to establish that Plaintiffs fall within the zone of interests \nprotected by the expedited removal statute.”). But none of the declarants in Make the Road was already being \nprocessed for expedited removal, and yet their declarations sufficed for those plaintiff associations’ standing. See \nMake the Rd., 405 F. Supp. 3d at 33. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 44 of 84\nto alter Make the Road’s application to this case. Plaintiffs fall within the statute’s zone of interests \nand may sue for relief under section 1252(e)(3)(A) and the APA cause of action.  \n2.  The Challenged Actions Exceed DHS’s Statutory Authority \nSatisfied that it likely has jurisdiction to resolve this case, and that no statutory provision \nor doctrine raised by Defendants bars this suit, the Court proceeds to the merits of Plaintiffs’ \nclaims. The Court first addresses Plaintiffs’ arguments that each of the three Challenged Actions \nexceeds DHS’s statutory authority. Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on that claim.  \nDefendants  argue  that  two  statutory  authorities  justify  the  Challenged  Actions:  the \nDesignation Provision and the Arriving Aliens Provision of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A). The Court \naddresses each in turn. \ni.  The Designation Provision Does Not Authorize Expedited Removal of Parolees \n \nDefendants attempt to ground the Challenged Actions’ lawfulness partially in the provision \nof 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) that permits the DHS Secretary to designate certain noncitizens for \nexpedited removal—i.e., the Designation Provision. As a reminder, that provision, in relevant part, \nauthorizes the Attorney General (now delegated to the DHS Secretary) to designate as eligible for \nexpedited removal any \nalien . . . who has not been admitted or paroled into the United States, and who has \nnot affirmatively shown, to the satisfaction of an immigration officer, that the alien \nhas been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period \nimmediately prior to the date of the determination of inadmissibility under this \nsubparagraph. \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). As of January 21, 2025, DHS has expanded its designation to \nthe full scope permitted under that statutory provision. See 2025 Designation Notice at 8139.  \nTwo of the three Challenged Actions explicitly relied upon the Designation Provision, and \nthe  DHS  Secretary’s  designation  thereunder,  as  their  authority.  The  January  23  Huffman \nMemorandum noted that the then-Acting Secretary of DHS had, in the 2025 Designation Notice, \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 45 of 84\n“expand[ed] the scope of expedited removal to the statutory maximum under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) \nwhich . . . includes certain aliens who have not been continuously present in the United States for \ntwo years.” January 23 Huffman Memorandum at 1. The Memorandum purported to “provide[] \nguidance regarding how to exercise enforcement discretion in implementing these policies,” with \n“these policies” referring in part to the scope of DHS’s designation. Id.22 Meanwhile, the March \n25 CHNV Termination Notice discussed DHS’s authority under the Designation Provision in some \ndetail as a primary reason for its termination of the CHNV Parole Programs. Among other \nreferences, the Notice stated that, because of the Designation Provision’s less-than-two-year \ncontinuous presence requirement, “[e]xpedited removal is available only when an alien has not \nbeen continuously present in the United States for at least the two years preceding the date of the \ninadmissibility determination.” March 25 CHNV Termination Notice at 13619.  \nWhether the third Challenged Action, the February 18 ICE Directive, also relied upon the \nDesignation Provision is a bit less clear. That confusion raises a separate defect, arbitrariness, \nwhich the Court discusses further below. But for present purposes, the Directive appears to invoke \nthe Designation Provision in one of its sections, in which it directed officers to “consider for \nexpedited removal” certain paroled noncitizens who “ha[ve] not been continuously physically \npresent in the United States for two years prior to the finding of inadmissibility by the ERO.” \nFebruary 18 ICE Directive at 1–2. \nBut the Designation Provision under the statute does not authorize the Challenged Actions. \nThat is because the Designation Provision forbids the expedited removal of noncitizens who have \nbeen, at any point in time, paroled into the United States.  \n \n22 The other “polic[y]” to which that sentence referred was a January 20 memorandum “clarif[ying] DHS’s position \nregarding the scope of the parole statute” and encouraging pauses, modifications, or termination of parole grants given \nunder categorical programs. January 23 Huffman Memorandum at 1. \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 46 of 84\nAs with any question of statutory interpretation, the Court “begin[s] with the text.” City of \nClarksville v. FERC, 888 F.3d 477, 482 (D.C. Cir. 2018). The Designation Provision authorizes \ndesignation for expedited removal of any noncitizen who, among other requirements, “has not \nbeen admitted or paroled into the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). On the text, the \nParties’ dispute comes down to the meaning of Congress’s use of the present-perfect tense: “has \nnot been . . . paroled.” Plaintiffs claim that “the negative form of the present perfect tense,” as the \nstatute employes, “indicate[s] an event that is neither continuing to the present nor occurred in the \npast.” ECF 28 at 26. They reason that the present-perfect tense “can, as a matter of pure semantics, \nrefer to a time in the indefinite past or to a past action or state that continues into the present.” Id. \nat 25–26 (quoting Turner v. U.S. Att’y Gen., 130 F.4th 1254, 1261 (11th Cir. 2025) (emphasis in \noriginal)). It follows, they argue, that the negative form of the present-perfect tense must indicate \nthat the event neither happened in the indefinite past nor is continuing into the present. Id. at 26. \nUnder that reading, whether a noncitizen’s parole is active, or has expired or been terminated, does \nnot matter. Either way, if the noncitizen was ever “paroled into the United States,” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), the Designation Provision may not be applied to them, ECF 28 at 26. \n  Yet, as Defendants correctly point out, Plaintiffs’ logic does not necessarily hold. Indeed, \nthe Supreme Court recently held that a particular statutory phrase framed in the present-perfect \ntense “conveys to a listener that the event in question continues to be true or valid,” even when \nused in the negative. Hewitt v. United States, 145 S. Ct. 2165, 2172 (2025). That case concerned a \nsection of the First Step Act that applied “to any offense that was committed before the date of \nenactment of this Act, if a sentence for the offense has not been imposed as of such date of \nenactment.” Id. at 2170 (quoting First Step Act § 403(b), 132 Stat. 5194, 5222 (2018) (emphasis \nadded)). The Court determined that, “[w]hen used in this way,” a sentence that “has not been \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 47 of 84\nimposed” means a sentence that has no “continued legal validity,” even if the sentence was \nimposed and had legal validity at some point in the past. Id. at 2172–73. By analogy, Defendants \nsuggest, the Designation Provision exempts only those whose parole has not been terminated and \ncontinues to be valid. ECF 31 at 1; ECF 26 at 46.  \n  Ultimately, the pure semantics of the phrase at issue cannot resolve this question. The \nSupreme  Court’s  analysis  in  Hewitt  alone  disproves  Plaintiffs’  mistaken  syllogism  that  the \nnegative form of the present-perfect tense necessarily means that neither of the potential meanings \nof the positive present-perfect tense applies. At the same time, Defendants err in suggesting that \nHewitt decided that the present-perfect tense always refers to an event that continues into the \npresent. To the contrary, the Hewitt Court indicated that its grammatical conclusion—that the \npresent-perfect tense necessarily refers to something that continues into the present—depended on \nthe “way” in which the phrase at issue was “used.” Hewitt, 145 S.Ct. at 2172. Specifically, the \npresent-perfect tense holds the meaning the Court ascribed to it when it “describe[s] situations \ninvolving a specific change of state that produces a continuing result.” Id. (internal citation and \nquotation marks omitted). In addition, the Hewitt Court referenced adjacent provisions of the \nstatute and background legal principles to determine whether its grammatical holding made sense \nin the context of the statute as a whole. Id. at 2172–74. That analysis is consistent with the Eleventh \nCircuit’s statement in Turner that the present-perfect tense can refer to two different things (either \n“a time in the indefinite past or . . . a past action or state that continues into the present”), and that \n“the question becomes which of those meanings applies in this statutory context.” Turner, 130 \nF.4th at 1261 (citing Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 133 (2024)).  \n  Examining the statutory context, Plaintiffs point to the words immediately surrounding the \nphrase at issue. Again, the statute permits designation for expedited removal of noncitizens who \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 48 of 84\n“ha[ve]  not  been  admitted  or  paroled.”  8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II)  (emphasis  added). \nApplying the canon of noscitur a sociis, Plaintiffs argue that “the meaning of ‘paroled’ is \nelucidated by its association with ‘admitted.’” ECF 28 at 27–28 (citing Fischer v. United States, \n603 U.S. 480, 487 (2024), for the proposition that “a word is given more precise content by the \nneighboring  words  with  which  it  is  associated”).  And  in  immigration  law,  “admission”  is \nsomething that happens at a specific point in time; it is not a “continuing status.” ECF 22-1 at 25–\n26 (quoting Sanchez v. Mayorkas, 593 U.S. 409, 415 (2021) as stating, “[l]awful status and \nadmission . . . are distinct concepts in immigration law”); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(13)(A) \n(defining “admission” and “admitted” as “the lawful entry of the alien into the United States after \ninspection and authorization by an immigration officer”). Plaintiffs acknowledge that “[p]arole,” \nunlike “admission,” can refer to “both a manner of entry and a status.” ECF 22-1 at 26. But when \naccompanied by “admitted,” which refers only to a manner of entry, “paroled” likely refers to a \nmanner of entry, too. Id. And if that is true, then Hewitt’s rule does not apply here, because Hewitt’s \ngrammatical conclusion applies when the present-perfect word at issue “describe[s] situations \ninvolving a specific change of state that produces a continuing result”—i.e., a change in “status.” \nHewitt, 145 S.Ct. at 2172–73. Defendants offer no response to this persuasive argument from \nPlaintiffs. \n  Like the Hewitt Court, Plaintiffs also look to “[b]ackground [legal] principles.” Id. at 2173; \nsee ECF 35 at 12–15 (Hr’g Tr. 12:3–15:7). As Plaintiffs rightly observe, Hewitt hung its holding \nin part on the “legal effect of vacatur” of a sentence. Hewitt, 145 S.Ct. at 2173 (citing Bond v. \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 (2014) for the proposition that “Congress legislates against the \nbackdrop of certain unexpressed presumptions” (cleaned up)). Because “the law acts as though [a] \nvacated [court] order never occurred,” it makes sense for an offender whose sentence was vacated \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 49 of 84\nto be treated under the First Step Act the same as someone who was never sentenced in the first \nplace. Id. at 2174. Here, background principles suggest the opposite: that termination of parole, \nunlike vacatur of a sentence, does not render that parole “void ab initio.” Id. at 2173. For example, \nPlaintiffs observe that a noncitizen is generally ineligible to apply for adjustment of status if the \nnoncitizen “was not admitted or paroled following inspection by an immigration officer.” 8 C.F.R. \n§ 245.1(b)(3); see ECF 35 at 14–15 (Hr’g Tr. 14:22–15:3). If the noncitizen was paroled into the \ncountry but that parole later expired or was terminated (as all parole does, since parole under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1182(d)(5) must be temporary), the regulation does not indicate that the noncitizen is \ntherefore  ineligible  for  adjustment  of  status.  To  the  contrary,  because  the  noncitizen \n“was . . . paroled,” they would remain eligible under that requirement. See 8 C.F.R. § 245.1(b)(3). \nThus, for at least some purposes, parole has ongoing legal effect even after it expires or is \nterminated. And, under Hewitt’s logic, it would therefore make sense for the Designation Provision \nto treat noncitizens who were paroled into the United States differently, even once their parole \nends, than noncitizens who entered the country without parole. \n  Defendants respond by pointing the Court to a different background principle that they say \ninformed the Designation Provision: the so-called “entry fiction.” ECF 28 at 33; ECF 26 at 46. \nUnder that principle, Defendants explain, “when parole is revoked, an alien reverts to the status he \npossessed prior to the grant of parole.” ECF 26 at 46. “In the case of all those paroled at a port of \nentry,” Defendants continue, “that is the position of an applicant for admission standing at the \nthreshold of entry.” Id. Defendants point to a few sources for that principle. First, they reference \nthe parole statute, which has long stated that parole “shall not be regarded as an admission of the \nalien,” and “when the purposes of such parole shall, in the opinion of the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, have been served the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 50 of 84\nhe was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that \nof any other applicant for admission to the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). They also \ncite a Supreme Court case that held, for purposes of a since-repealed provision of the Immigration \nand Nationality Act (INA), that a noncitizen paroled into the United States is treated the same as \na noncitizen held in detention and therefore is not considered to be “within the United States.” \nLeng May Ma v. Barber, 357 U.S. 185, 186–188 (1958) (citing INA § 243(h)); see ECF 26 at 46. \nFinally, Defendants cite a Supreme Court decision and two decisions from other circuits that post-\ndate IIRAIRA’s passage by at least a decade and interpret, or just recite, the above-quoted text in \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). See ECF 26 at 46 (citing Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 288 \n(2018); Duarte v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 1044, 1058 (5th Cir. 2022); Ibragimov v. Gonzales, 476 F.3d \n125, 137 (2d Cir. 2007)).  \n  Defendants’ sources do not establish the background principle they need to show. First, \nsection 1182(d)(5)(A) does not, as Defendants insist, say that parolees return, upon the termination \nor expiration of their parole, to “the position of an applicant for admission standing at the threshold \nof entry.” ECF 26 at 46. Rather, the provision says that two things happen to such a parolee: (1) he \n“shall  forthwith  return  or  be  returned  to  the  custody  from  which  he  was  paroled”;  and \n(2) “thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other \napplicant for admission to the United States.” In other words, the noncitizen is physically brought \nback into immigration detention (“custody”) and then legally continues to be treated as an \n“applicant for admission,” because his parole itself did not constitute an admission. See 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(5)(A) (stating that parole “shall not be regarded as an admission of the alien”). That \ndoes not prove that the law treats the parole as if it never happened. At minimum, it recognizes \nthat the parole physically happened, because it contemplates that the noncitizen must be returned \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 51 of 84\nto detention. Moreover, it does not imply a return to the status of an applicant for admission, \nbecause a noncitizen is already an “applicant[] for admission” while their parole is active. See, \ne.g., Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 806 (“[T]he INA expressly authorizes DHS to process \napplicants  for  admission  under  a  third  option:  parole.”)  (citing  8  U.S.C.  §  1182(d)(5)(A)). \nAccordingly, the statute says that the noncitizen whose parole is terminated “continue[s]” to be \ntreated as an applicant for admission, not that she “returns” to the status of applicant for admission.  \n  The cases Defendants cite do not get them there, either. Again, Leng May Ma interpreted \ndifferent statutory language (“within the United States”) in a different, since-replaced provision of \nthe INA. 357 U.S. at 186. Defendants supply no evidence that Congress intended to incorporate \nthat decision into the distinct text and context of IIRAIRA’s expedited removal provisions. To the \ncontrary, as explained below, the legislative history conflicts with Defendants’ interpretation. As \nfor the other cases, Jennings merely repeated the language of section 1182(d)(5)(A) to show that \nparole is distinct from detention. 583 U.S. at 288. Duarte just said that parole allows a noncitizen \n“physically . . . to enter the country” even though his “legal status” remains “the same as if he or \nshe were still being held at the border waiting for his or her application for admission to be granted \nor denied.” 27 F.4th at 1058. That is perfectly consistent with the above reading of section \n1182(a)(5)(A): a parolee has the legal status of “applicant for admission” before being paroled, \nduring their parole, and after their parole ends. Accord id. (“[W]hen an alien is granted parole, \nimmigration  authorities  temporarily  allow  the  alien  access  to  the  country  while  his  or  her \napplication for admission is pending.”). Similarly, all Ibragimov said is that, “[a]lthough paroled \naliens  physically  enter  the  United  States  for  a  temporary  period,  they  nevertheless  remain \nconstructively detained at the border, i.e. legally unadmitted, while their status is being resolved \nby immigration officials.” 476 F.3d at 134. Again, it does not follow that a noncitizen whose parole \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 52 of 84\nends “returns” to a previous status as if their parole never happened. Instead, under section \n1182(d)(5), they physically return to custody and legally remain an applicant for admission. Thus, \nthat section offers no real support to Defendants’ reading of the Designation Provision. \n  To buttress their interpretation of the Designation Provision’s text, Plaintiffs next turn to \nDHS’s own regulations, including those promulgated closely following IIRAIRA’s enactment. See \nLoper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 388 (2024) (explaining that, when interpreting a \nstatute in an APA challenge, “the informed judgment of the Executive Branch—especially in the \nform of an interpretation issued contemporaneously with the enactment of the statute—[may] be \nentitled to great weight” (internal quotations omitted)). Plaintiffs note, for example, that multiple \nprovisions in 8 C.F.R. § 235.3—the expedited removal regulation, adopted shortly after IIRAIRA \npassed—refer to parole in the past tense, rather than the present-perfect tense of the statute. See, \ne.g.,  8  C.F.R.  §  235.3(b)(6)  (“If  the  Commissioner  determines  that  the  expedited  removal \nprovisions . . . shall apply to any or all aliens described in [the Designation Provision], such alien \nwill be given a reasonable opportunity to establish to the satisfaction of the examining immigration \nofficer that he or she was admitted or paroled into the United States follow inspection at a port-\nof-entry.”) (emphasis added); id. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii) (“An alien who was not inspected and admitted \nor paroled into the United States but who establishes that he or she has been continuously \nphysically present in the United States for the 2-year period . . . .”) (emphasis added). In addition, \nthe regulation’s Designation Provision describes noncitizens eligible for designation as “aliens \nwho arrive in, attempt to enter, or have entered the United States without having been admitted or \nparoled  following  inspection  by  an  immigration  officer  at  a  designated  port-of-entry.”  Id. \n(emphasis added). Both such uses—with the word parole in some version of a past tense alongside \nother verbs that are all present tense—makes clear that parole under those provisions refers to a \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 53 of 84\nmoment in time when the noncitizen entered the country at a port of entry and was granted parole. \nThe regulation thus reinforces Plaintiffs’ position that parole operates under the Designation \nProvision as a method of entry, not a status. \n   So, too, does DHS’s  apparent understanding of its authority under the Designation \nProvision in the years since that regulation. For example, in DHS’s 2019 Designation Notice, in \nwhich the agency designated for expedited removal all those it believed to be eligible under the \nDesignation  Provision,  the  agency  stated  that  a  key  question  for  eligibility  was  whether  a \nnoncitizen was “physically present in the United States without having been admitted or paroled \nfollowing inspection by an immigration officer at a designated port of entry.” 2019 Designation \nNotice at 35414. A further clue lies in the Designation Notice’s statement that its designation “does \nnot apply to aliens who arrive at U.S. ports of entry, because those aliens are already subject to \nexpedited removal.” Id. That statement unmistakably refers to the fact that DHS has defined the \nterm “arriving alien” for purposes of the statute’s Arriving Aliens Provision to include noncitizens \n“paroled pursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)], and even after any such parole is terminated or \nrevoked.” 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. In the following section, this Court finds that regulatory definition to be \nultra vires to the extent it subjects parolees to expedited removal. But DHS has, of course, believed \nits regulation to be valid. Thus, its statement in the 2019 Designation Notice that its new \ndesignation “d[id] not apply to” arriving aliens suggests it believed that its new designation did \nnot apply to those with either active or terminated parole. 2019 Designation Notice at 35414.23  \n \n23 Indeed, the Government has even in recent months (since issuing the Challenged Actions) reiterated that prior \nunderstanding, stating in a filing in an individual noncitizen’s removal case the following: “Petitioner . . . argues that \nbecause Petitioner—an arriving alien—was paroled, [the Designation Provision] cannot apply to him. But this misses \nthe point entirely: Petitioner is not subject to [the Designation Provision], he is subject to [the Arriving Aliens \nProvision] as an arriving alien.” Resp’ts Mem. of Law in Opp’n to the Pet., Compl., and Mot. for Prelim. Inj., Mata \nVelasquez v. Kurtzdorfer, Case No. 1:25-cv-493 (W.D.N.Y. June 18, 2025), ECF No. 42.  \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 54 of 84\n  Defendants respond not by contesting Plaintiffs’ interpretations of those DHS regulations \nbut instead by pointing to another regulation that suggests parolees are subject to expedited \nremoval. ECF 26 at 47–49. One of the agency’s asylum regulations states that an asylum officer \nmay, upon denying a noncitizen’s asylum claim, proceed with expedited removal of a paroled \nasylum applicant if the applicant “is an arriving alien or is otherwise subject to removal under \n§ 235.3(b) of this chapter, and was paroled into the United States on or after April 1, 1997,” and if \nthat parole “has expired or been terminated.” 8 C.F.R. § 208.14(c)(4)(ii). According to Defendants, \nthis demonstrates that the regulation envisions parolees to be subject to expedited removal under \neither the “arriving alien” definition or the Designation Provision (i.e., the other basis for expedited \nremoval eligibility under 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)).  \n  On its face, that language does seem to negate Plaintiffs’ suggestion that DHS regulations \nuniformly treated the Designation Provision as inapplicable to noncitizens who were paroled into \nthe United States at any point. At best for Defendants, that shows that the agency’s regulations are \ninternally contradictory and therefore provide little insight into the statute’s meaning. Still, any \nimplication from section 208.14(c)(4)(ii) is weak. First, unlike the regulatory provisions Plaintiffs \ncite, this provision does not appear in the original 1997 rulemaking that first implemented \nIIRAIRA’s expedited removal system. See 1997 Rulemaking.24 Second, the regulation draws a \nsharp distinction between noncitizens paroled before and after April 1, 1997. Compare 8 C.F.R. \n§ 208.14(c)(4)(i) (providing that those paroled before that date may be subject only to section 240 \nremoval) with id. § 208.14(c)(4)(ii) (providing that those paroled after that date may be subject to \nexpedited removal). Such a distinction appears nowhere in the regulation construing the statute’s \nDesignation Provision. It does, however, appear in the regulatory definition of “arriving alien.” \n \n24 Instead, DHS’s predecessor agency added this paragraph in 2000. See Asylum Procedures, 65 Fed. Reg. 76121, \n76134 (Dec. 6, 2000).  \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 55 of 84\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1.2; Amendment of the Regulatory Definition of Arriving Alien, 63 Fed. Reg. \n19382, 19382 (Apr. 20, 1998). That fact adds to the implication that the asylum regulation \nenvisioned expedited removal of parolees only pursuant to the agency’s asserted authority under \nthe Arriving Aliens Provision, not the Designation Provision. \n  The other regulations Defendants invoke help them even less. Defendants point to 8 C.F.R. \n§ 235.3(b)(6), arguing that, because it establishes a process for termination of parole, it “envisions \nthe possibility that such an alien with parole terminated could be subject to expedited removal or, \nat the very least, does not exclude that possibility.” ECF 26 at 48. In context of the rest of the \nregulatory provision, that is a possible reading. But the language is hardly clear. While the \nprovision discusses termination of parole, the only people it specifically says should be subject to \nexpedited removal are those who “cannot satisfy the examining officer that [they] w[ere] lawfully \nadmitted or paroled.” 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6). It says nothing about what should happen to those \nwho were “paroled” but whose parole the officer decides to terminate. Id.  \nFinally, Defendants note a provision of the parole regulation which states that, after a \nnoncitizen’s parole is terminated, “[a]ny further inspection or hearing shall be conducted under \nsection 235 or 240 of the Act.” 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i); see ECF 26 at 48. Section 235 of the \nINA, as amended by IIRAIRA, does indeed contain the expedited removal provisions, whereas \nsection 240 contains the standard removal proceedings in front of an IJ. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225, \n1229a. But section 235 does not only contain the expedited removal provisions. Rather, as its title \nsuggests, section 235 governs “[i]nspection by immigration officers” generally. See also id. \n§ 1225(a)(3) (stating that “[a]ll aliens” applying for admission “shall be inspected by immigration \nofficers”). More specifically, it provides that certain noncitizens (those that fall under the Arriving \nAliens Provision or, if/when designated, the Designation Provision) are subject to expedited \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 56 of 84\nremoval proceedings, which it then outlines. See id.  § 1225(b)(1). It then provides that all “other \naliens” who are “applicant[s] for admission” and who do not “clearly and beyond a doubt” meet \nthe criteria for admission “shall be detained for a proceeding under section 1229a of this title” (i.e., \na section 240 proceeding). Id. § 1225(b)(2). Thus, the parole regulation Defendants cite is easily \nread as providing not, as Defendants insist, for either expedited removal or section 240 removal \nfor noncitizens whose parole is terminated. Instead, it appears to provide for either inspection \nunder section 235 (which can then lead to either expedited or regular removal proceedings) or, if \nthe parolee does not require any “further inspection,” to section 240 proceedings. 8 C.F.R. \n§ 212.5(e)(2)(i). All told, then, regulatory provisions implementing or involving the Designation \nProvision favor Plaintiffs’ interpretation.  \nAs a last gasp, Defendants try to divine meaning from the Supreme Court’s stay of Judge \nTalwani’s decision preliminarily enjoining termination of the CHNV Parole Programs. See ECF \n26 at 46 n.3 (citing Doe, 145 S. Ct. 1524). In reviewing the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice, \nJudge Talwani decided that the Designation Provision does not permit expedited removal of a \nnoncitizen if the noncitizen was paroled when they entered the United States upon inspection at \nthe border. Doe, 2025 WL 1099602, at *16. The Supreme Court granted the Government’s request \nto stay that injunction without explanation. Doe, 145 S. Ct. 1524. Defendants say that stay “calls \ninto question the soundness of the district court’s reasoning.” ECF 26 at 46 n.3. This Court cannot \nmake that leap. After all, “[t]he [Supreme] Court’s stay order is not a decision on the merits.” \nMerrill v. Milligan, 142 S. Ct. 879, 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring in grant of application \nfor stays). And this Court does not know why the lower court order was stayed (i.e., because of \nlikelihood of success on the merits, irreparable harm, or something else).  \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 57 of 84\nBecause the Designation Provision does not authorize designation for expedited removal \nof any noncitizen who has, at any point in time, been paroled into the United States, that statutory \nprovision does not authorize the Challenged Actions. \nii.  The Arriving Aliens Provision Does Not Authorize Expedited Removal of Parolees \nTo survive on the merits, the Challenged Actions must instead conform to the authority \ngranted to DHS under the Arriving Aliens Provision. They do not.  \nRecall that, under IIRAIRA, the only other set of noncitizens eligible for expedited removal \nbesides those covered under the Designation Provision are those who “[are] arriving” in the United \nStates. 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). The statute does not define the term “arriving.” Plaintiffs argue \nthat its use of the present-progressive tense “signals an action that is temporary but currently \noccurring.” ECF 22-1 at 27. Thus, the statute’s category of “arriving” noncitizens refers to “people \nwho are currently in the process of arriving in the United States at a port of entry and who will no \nlonger be arriving once that action has ended.” Id. at 27–28. Once inspected at the border and \nparoled into the country, Plaintiffs reason, a noncitizen is no longer in the process of “arriving.” \nId. at 28 (citing Bollat Vasquez v. Wolf, 460 F. Supp. 3d 99, 111 (D. Mass. 2020), which interpreted \nthe Arriving Aliens Provision to mean, “if [noncitizen] applicants [for admission] are apprehended \nwhile crossing the border (whether or not at a check point), they are ‘arriving’ applicants under \nthe statute, and if apprehended at some point thereafter, they are not ‘arriving,’ but rather ‘aliens \npresent in the United States who have not been admitted.’” (cleaned up)). To support that reading, \nPlaintiffs note that other uses of the words “arriving,” “arrival,” or “arrive” in 8 U.S.C. § 1225 \nplainly refer to a process that occurs upon physical entry at the border, “not an interminable \nimplicit statutory status.” ECF 28 at 30. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d)(2) (authorizing detention of \nnoncitizens “on the vessel or at the airport of arrival”); id. § 1225(b)(2)(C) (authorizing returning \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 58 of 84\na noncitizen “who is arriving on land (whether or not at a designated port of arrival)” to a \ncontiguous territory after section 240 proceedings); id. § 1225(b)(1)(F) (exempting from expedited \nremoval a noncitizen from certain countries “who arrives by aircraft at a port of entry”).  \nMeanwhile, Defendants lean once again on the purported background principle, discussed \nabove, that “aliens paroled into the United States are legally in the position of aliens standing at \nthe border, regardless of the duration of their parole.” ECF 26 at 42 (citing Leng May Ma, 357 U.S. \nat 188–91; Ibragimov, 476 F.3d at 134). And they point, yet again, to language in the parole statute \nand regulation providing that a noncitizen whose parole ends “shall forthwith return or be returned \nto the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in \nthe same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(d)(5)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 212.5(e)(2)(i) (providing that when parole ends the alien “shall be \nrestored to the status that he or she had at the time of parole”); see ECF 26 at 43. Finally, \nDefendants refer back to the regulatory definition of “arriving alien,” which since the first \nrulemaking under IIRAIRA has provided that “[a]n arriving alien remains an arriving alien even \nif paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the Act, and even after any such parole is terminated or \nrevoked.” ECF 26 at 41–42 (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 1.2). They also note the agency’s statement, upon \nadopting that definition, that its “inclusion of paroled aliens was based on the statutory language \nin section 212(d)(5) of the Act,” i.e., the statutory parole provision. Id. at 43 (quoting 62 Fed. Reg. \nat 10313).  \nAll  told,  Plaintiffs’  interpretation  is  the  best  reading  of  the  statute,  despite  DHS’s \nlongstanding regulation to the contrary. See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 394 (holding that “courts \nmust exercise independent judgment in determining the meaning of statutory provisions” and need \nnot defer to agencies’ interpretations). When interpreting a statutory term Congress did not define, \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 59 of 84\ncourts first look to the term’s ordinary meaning. United States v. Alford, 89 F.4th 943, 949 (D.C. \nCir.), cert. denied, 145 S. Ct. 180 (2024)). “Arrive” means “to reach a destination” or “to make an \nappearance.” Arrive, Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary (1996); see also Arrive, Oxford \nEnglish Reference Dictionary (1996) (defining “arrive,” when followed by “in,” as “reach a \ndestination; come to the end of a journey or a specified part of a journey”). Read according to its \nplain meaning, a noncitizen “arriving” in the United States would be one who is in the process of \nreaching his or her destination (the United States) and making an appearance here. It would not \nnaturally be read to refer to someone who previously reached the United States via a port of entry, \nunderwent inspection at that port of entry, and then was paroled into the United States (beyond \ntheir original destination) for an indefinite period of time. Thus, if the plain language governs, \nPlaintiffs have the upper hand. \nThe term’s context within the rest of the statute accords with that ordinary meaning. \nPlaintiffs are correct that multiple other provisions in IIRAIRA section 235 use “arrive,” or some \nconjugation thereof, to refer to physical arrival at a port of entry. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(d)(2); id. \n§ 1225(b)(2)(C); id. § 1225(b)(1)(F). Defendants offer no response to those provisions. They do, \nhowever, point to other provisions of the statute they call “textual clues” demonstrating that \nparolees are always considered “arriving.” ECF 26 at 44. First, they note that Congress explicitly \nexcluded paroled noncitizens from the Designation Provision but wrote no similar exclusion into \nthe Arriving Aliens provision, and the Court should give meaning to that choice. Id. (citing Bates \nv. United States, 522 U.S. 23, 29–30 (1997), for the proposition, “where Congress includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is \ngenerally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or \nexclusion”). That argument just begs the question, though: Congress would only think it needed \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 60 of 84\nto carve out parolees from the category of “aliens” who are “arriving” in the United States if it \nthought the term would otherwise include parolees. The Designation Provision, by contrast, carves \nout parolees from the larger category of “aliens,” which of course otherwise includes parolees. See \n8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Second,  Defendants  point  to  the  title  of  section  1225(b)(1), \n“[i]nspection of aliens arriving in the United States and certain other aliens who have not been \nadmitted or paroled.” ECF 26 at 44 (emphasis added). They say this highlights Congress’s \nexclusion of parolees only from the “other aliens” defined in the Designation Provision. Id. But \nthat does not really follow; the title is just as easily read as modifying both “aliens arriving” and \n“other aliens’ with “have not been admitted or paroled.” And regardless, all it does is track the \nlanguage of the Arriving Aliens and Designation Provisions. A statutory title, while informative, \ndoes not displace the meaning of the statutory text itself. See City & Cnty. of San Francisco v.EPA, \n145 S. Ct. 704, 714 (2025). Finally, Defendants note that Congress exempted from expedited \nremoval certain noncitizens from certain Western Hemisphere nations, but did not carve out \nparolees. See 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(F). Again, that just begs the question. Those noncitizens could \notherwise have been eligible for expedited removal under the Arriving Aliens or Designation \nProvisions. Not so, necessarily, for parolees. \nSo the statutory text and context weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. Nonetheless, Defendants insist \nthat the term “arriving” represents a “term of art” and should be given that meaning. ECF 35 at 57 \n(Hr’g Tr. 57:18–24). Yet, just as it did for the Designation Provision, Defendants’ argument from \nbackground principles comes apart on further inspection. First, none of the sources Defendants \ncite interpret the word “arriving,” which makes it hard to consider it a “term of art.” Recall that \nLeng May Ma interpreted the distinct term “within the United States” for purposes of a different \nprovision of the INA. 357 U.S. at 188. Even worse for Defendants, Ibragimov described parole as \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 61 of 84\n“a  means  by  which  the  government  allows  aliens  who  have  arrived  at  a  port-of-entry  to \ntemporarily remain in the United States pending the review and adjudication of their immigration \nstatus.” 476 F.3d at 134 (emphasis added). Under that construction, while a parolee remains \n“legally unadmitted,” they “have arrived”—i.e., their arrival is complete, whereas their admission \nis not. Id. That reading is consistent with the statute’s distinction between aliens who have been \n“admitted” and those who have been “paroled.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). It does little to \nprove Defendants’ preferred definition of “arrived.” And Duarte, the other circuit case Defendants \ncite, merely noted the regulatory definition reflected in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 (that “a parolee normally \nfits the regulatory definition of an ‘arriving alien’”) but did not actually scrutinize that regulation. \nInstead, it was concerned with whether parolees are considered “applicant[s] for admission while \non parole” (a question it answered in the affirmative). 27 F.4th at 1059–60. Thus, none of those \ncases establishes the term of art that Defendants claim Congress inserted into the statute. And \n“absent” any “evidence” that Congress intended to employ a term of art, “those whose lives are \ngoverned by law are entitled to rely on its ordinary meaning, not left to speculate about hidden \nmessages.” Feliciano v. Dep’t of Transp., 145 S. Ct. 1284, 1291 (2025).  \nWorse yet, even Defendants’ reading of the parole statute suggests a background principle \naltogether different from the one Defendants need to prove. Recall that Defendants believe the \nparole statute enshrined the principle that “when parole is revoked, an alien reverts to the status he \npossessed prior to the grant of parole,” namely “the position of an applicant for admission standing \nat the threshold of entry.” ECF 26 at 46. As discussed in the previous section, the statute actually \nsays something more limited. But neither account supports DHS’s position in its regulatory \ndefinition of “arriving alien,” which is that noncitizens are considered arriving both when their \nparole is active and after it is terminated. See 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. To what “status” does a noncitizen \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 62 of 84\nwhose parole was revoked “revert[]?” ECF 26 at 46. It cannot be the “status” of “arriving alien”; \nunder 8 C.F.R. § 1.2, a parolee never leaves that status, even when their parole is active. It is \ntherefore no saving grace of Defendants’ position that DHS’s predecessor agency said it relied \nupon the parole statute when coming up with the definition of “arriving alien” in its 1997 \nregulation. See 62 Fed. Reg. at 10313. Rather, that claim only highlights the regulatory definition’s \nconflict with the statutory scheme.  \nIndeed, the regulatory definition conflicts even with another portion of the regulatory \nscheme. The language in 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) at least heavily implies that noncitizens with active \nparole may not be subjected to expedited removal. See 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) (giving noncitizens \nin expedited removal proceedings “a reasonable opportunity to establish to the satisfaction of the \nexamining immigration officer that he or she was admitted or paroled into the United States \nfollowing inspection at a port-of-entry” and providing that “[a]n alien who cannot satisfy the \nexamining officer that he or she was lawfully admitted or paroled will be ordered removed \npursuant to section 235(b)(1) of the Act.”)  Whether it allows the agency to terminate that parole \nand then send the noncitizen to expedited removal is another matter, discussed above. But if the \nArriving Aliens Provision permitted the agency to subject a noncitizen to expedited removal even \nwhile that parole is active, this entire regulatory provision would be irrelevant. At best, then, the \nregulatory definition provides little insight into the statutory definition—the latter of which is our \nconcern here. See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 388 (explaining that courts interpreting a regulatory \nstatute give more or less weight to an agency interpretation depending on “‘the thoroughness \nevident in [the agency’s] consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier \nand later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power \nto control’” (quoting Skidmore v. Swift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 63 of 84\nLegislative history and purpose put a final nail in the coffin of Defendants’ interpretation. \nAlthough the relevant legislative history is thin, it contains some indications that Congress focused \nits concern on noncitizens physically arriving at the border for entry, not those already physically \npresent within the country. For instance, one House Report noted that the law’s new expedited \nremoval procedures were “necessary because thousands of aliens arrive in the U.S. at airports each \nyear without valid documents and attempt to illegally enter the U.S.” H.R. Rep. 104-469, 157–58 \n(1996). “Unless such aliens claim to be U.S. nationals, or state a fear of persecution,” the Report \nwent on, “there is no requirement under the Constitution or international treaty to do anything \nother than return them, as promptly as possible, to where they boarded the plane to come here.” \nId. Although that provision did not discuss parole, it did use the term “arrive” in a way that clearly \ndescribes physical arrival at a port of entry (specifically, an airport). And it described “return[ing] \nthem” to their country from which they flew. Id. It did not explicitly contemplate a regime wherein \nnoncitizens arriving at airports are paroled into the country and returned to their airport of origin \nmonths or years later.  \nDefendants’ interpretation also creates an oddity that appears to contradict the statute’s \npurpose. Under Defendants’ definition of “arriving alien,” a noncitizen who snuck into the country \noutside of an inspection point gets a full section 240 removal hearing as long as they have been \nphysically present in the United States for two years. By contrast, a noncitizen who entered at an \ninspection point and was paroled after inspection can face expedited removal forever, regardless \nof  how  long  they  have  been  physically  present  in  the  United  States.  Defendants  offer  no \nexplanation for such a counterintuitive result, nor does the legislative history show that Congress \nintended that result. Quite the opposite: such a result flies in the face of the House Report’s \nstatement that IIRAIRA was intended to “replace certain aspects of the current ‘entry doctrine,’ \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 64 of 84\nunder which illegal aliens who have entered the United States without inspection gain equities and \nprivileges in immigration proceedings that are not available to aliens who present themselves for \ninspection at a port of entry.” H.R. 104-469 at 225.  \nYet another aspect of the legislative history supports Plaintiffs’ reading and undermines \nDefendants’. The 1996 House Report shows that IIRAIRA was intended in part to restrict parole, \nbut  not  by  subjecting  parolees  to  expedited  removal.  It  noted  that,  in  1994,  the  Clinton \nAdministration made a migration agreement with Cuba that included using the parole authority to \nadmit up to 20,000 Cuban nationals annually, who would then be entitled to adjust to permanent \nresident status under the Cuban Adjustment Act. The House Report called that “a misuse” of the \nparole system that “ha[d] not been authorized by Congress.” H.R. 104-469 at 140–41. And \naccordingly, the proposed bill, which eventually became IIRAIRA, tightened the criteria for \ngranting parole. Id. at 140. Nowhere in that Report, or elsewhere in the legislative history, did it \nsay that Congress sought to address what it saw as excessive parole by subjecting parolees to \nexpedited removal once they were already paroled in.25 If the Congress that was so concerned \nabout abuse of the parole system had created a solution by which the Executive could summarily \ndeport parolees using expedited removal, you would think it would have noted as much.  \nIn the end, the only way to make sense of the statutory scheme Congress created is to see \nthat parolees fall under neither the Arriving Aliens Provision nor the Designation Provision. Any \nother result conflicts with other aspects of the statute and regulations, Congress’s evident purpose, \nand the ordinary meaning of the statute’s words. At bottom, Defendants rest their argument under \n \n25 Instead, the Report said the following: “The text of section 212(d)(5) is clear that the parole authority was intended \nto be used on a case-by-case basis to meet specific needs, and not as a supplement to Congressionally-established \nimmigration policy. In recent years, however, parole has been used increasingly to admit entire categories of aliens \nwho do not qualify for admission under any other category in immigration law, with the intent that they will remain \npermanently in the United States. This contravenes the intent of section 212(d)(5), but also illustrates why further, \nspecific limitations on the Attorney General’s discretion are necessary.” H.R. Rep. 104-469 at 140. \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 65 of 84\nboth provisions on a purported background legal principle that they cannot even pin down. In the \nface of all the evidence to the contrary, Defendants’ thin argument cannot stand. Accordingly, \nneither the Designation Provision nor the Arriving Aliens Provision authorizes the Challenged \nActions, and the Challenged Actions are therefore likely invalid as ultra vires. \n3.  The Challenged Actions Are Arbitrary and Capricious \nIndependent of being ultra vires, the Challenged Actions are also likely invalid as arbitrary \nand  capricious.  Under  blackletter  administrative  law,  agencies  must  provide  “reasoned \nexplanation[s]” for their actions. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 \nU.S. 1, 35 (2020). An agency action is arbitrary and capricious if it “has relied on factors which \nCongress has not intended it to consider, entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the \nproblem, offered an explanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, \nor is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n43 (1983). In short, “an agency must give adequate reasons for its decisions,” Encino Motorcars, \nLLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016), such that a reviewing court can “evaluate the agency’s \nrationale at the time of decision,” Pension Ben. Guar. Corp. v. LTV Corp., 496 U.S. 633, 654 \n(1990). This includes at least some explanation of the agency’s legal “conclusion,” especially if \nthe legal conclusion upon which the action relies conflicts with the agency’s prior view. Bauer v. \nDeVos, 325 F. Supp. 3d 74, 109 (D.D.C. 2018). It also includes consideration of “alternatives that \nare within the ambit of the [previous] policy” and any “legitimate reliance” on the previous policy. \nRegents, 591 U.S. at 30 (cleaned up).  \nIn Plaintiffs’ view, the Challenged Actions fail that standard in multiple ways. For one \nthing, they contend, the Challenged Actions contain little in the way of explanation at all. ECF 22-\n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 66 of 84\n1 at 30–31. To the extent they do, Plaintiffs argue, those explanations are inconsistent with one \nanother and provide conflicting interpretations of the agency’s own statutory authority. Id. at 31–\n34. And beyond that, the Challenged Actions’ explanations lack “even any mention, much less any \nanalysis,  of  the  impact  that  applying  expedited  removal  to  parolees  would  have  on  parole \nbeneficiaries . . . their families, their sponsors, their employers, and their communities,” nor do \nthey contain analysis of “the humanitarian purpose of parole” or “available alternatives.” Id. at 34–\n36.  \nDefendants first fight the premise that arbitrary-and-capricious review is available at all. \nSuch review, they argue, applies only to “final agency action,” defined as an action (1) that \n“mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” and (2) “from which legal \nconsequences will flow.” ECF 26 at 50 (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 704; Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177–78 (1997) (cleaned up)). The Challenged Actions, Defendants reason, do not “purport to make \nany changes in rules governing which aliens are” subject to expedited removal, but rather merely \nrestate the agency’s longstanding interpretation of expedited removal eligibility under the “arriving \naliens” definition of 8 C.F.R. § 1.2. Id. Next, Defendants argue that, even if arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review did apply, the Challenged Actions would pass it. The Challenged Actions, they \nsay, merely “assume[]” the authority to subject parolees to expedited removal; they do not purport \nto create that authority, so they do not need to explain their reasons for that assertion of authority. \nId. at 51. Moreover, the Challenged Actions’ legal justifications are not “inconsistent,” as Plaintiffs \nallege; they just rely on alternative but equally available legal authorities (the Arriving Aliens \nProvision  and/or  the  Designation  Provision).  Id.  at  51–53.  Defendants  also  invoke  DHS’s \n“unfettered discretion over whether to initiate [removal] proceedings” and which type of removal \nproceeding  to  initiate—decisions  that  Defendants  call  unreviewable.  Id.  at  54–55.  Finally, \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 67 of 84\nDefendants claim that the Challenged Actions are so clearly authorized under the expedited \nremoval statute that the agency need not justify Congress’s “policy decision” any further. Id. at 55–\n56.  \nDefendants’ threshold objection—that arbitrary-and-capricious review does not apply—\nlacks merit. APA section 704 authorizes judicial review both of “[a]gency action” that is “made \nreviewable by statute” and “final agency action.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. Defendants completely omit that \nfirst criterion from their discussion. Yet, as Plaintiffs note, that first criterion covers the Challenged \nActions.  See  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(e)(3)(A)  (authorizing  “[j]udicial  review”  in  this  District  of \n“whether . . . a written policy directive, written policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or \nunder the authority of the Attorney General to implement [section 1225(b)], is not consistent with \napplicable provisions of this subchapter or is otherwise in violation of law”). As this Court already \ndecided above, the Challenged Actions qualify under that provision. Thus, the statute authorizes \njudicial review of them for purposes of the APA. Accord Las Americas Immigrant Advoc. Ctr. v. \nWolf, 507 F. Supp. 3d 1, 34 (D.D.C. 2020) (K.B. Jackson, J.), voluntarily dismissed sub nom. Las \nAmericas Immigrant Advoc. Ctr. v. Mayorkas, No. 20-5386, 2024 WL 3632500 (D.C. Cir. Aug. \n1, 2024); Grace v. Whitaker, 344 F. Supp. 3d 96, 118 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d in part, rev’d in part \non other grounds and remanded sub nom. Grace v. Barr, 965 F.3d 883 (D.C. Cir. 2020). That \nresult resolves the issue, because judicial review under the APA includes consideration of whether \nthe challenged agency action (whether “final” or otherwise) is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nOn  the  substance,  the  Challenged  Actions  do  indeed  fail  even  the  “fundamentally \ndeferential” standard of arbitrary-and-capricious review. Fox v. Clinton, 684 F.3d 67, 75 (D.C. \nCir. 2012) (explaining that the standard is “fundamentally deferential” but that “no deference is \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 68 of 84\nowed to an agency action that is based on an agency’s purported expertise where the agency’s \nexplanation for its action lacks any coherence” (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). \nFirst, the January 23 Huffman Memorandum claimed to “provide[] guidance regarding how to \nexercise  enforcement  discretion  in  implementing”  two  previously  announced  “policies”—a \nmemorandum authorizing DHS components to terminate certain grants of parole “immediately,” \nand the 2025 Designation Notice expanding expedited removal to the full scope of the Designation \nProvision. January 23 Huffman Memorandum at 1. Specifically, it “direct[ed]” DHS components \nto “consider” subjecting to expedited removal “any alien DHS is aware of” who “is amenable to \nexpedited removal but to whom expedited removal has not been applied,” including by terminating \nany such noncitizen’s “active parole status.” Id. at 2. It also “direct[ed]” those components to \n“consider” placing in “removal proceedings” (note: not “expedited removal”) noncitizens who \n“d[id] not meet the conditions described in (1)” (i.e., were not “amenable to expedited removal”) \nand were subject to a categorical parole policy that Huffman’s earlier memorandum directed be \n“paused, modified, or “terminated.” Id.  \nBecause the January 23 Huffman Memorandum referenced the 2025 Designation Notice \nand its two-year-continuous-presence limit, see id. at 1, it seems possible that the reason for the \ndifferential treatment of parolees—directing some to be considered for expedited removal and \nsome  for  (presumably  section  240)  removal—was  that  the  latter  group  included  parolees \ncontinuously present in the United States for more than two years and thus ineligible for expedited \nremoval under even the Defendants’ view of the Designation Provision. But the Memorandum did \nnot state that reason, much less justify it. And it would seem to require some explanation, given \nDefendants’ view of its authority under the Arriving Aliens Provision. Under DHS’s longstanding \nregulation applying that Provision, 8 C.F.R. § 1.2, all noncitizens who were paroled at a port of \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 69 of 84\nentry (whether that parole is active or terminated) are “amenable to expedited removal,” as the \nMemorandum put it. Id. at 2. Indeed, Defendants claim in this litigation that the “arriving aliens” \nregulatory definition, not the Designation Provision, was the basis for the Memorandum, despite \nthe lack of any citation to that regulation anywhere in the document. See ECF 26 at 51. So whom \nwould the second category—noncitizens with parole granted through a categorical program that \nHuffman had directed be paused or terminated—include? Under Defendants’ interpretation of its \nauthority since 1997, potentially no one. Alternatively, it may include those who do not meet the \ninadmissibility criteria (fraud/misrepresentation or lack of documents) for expedited removal. See \n8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A). But the Court is left guessing, because the Memorandum did not cite its \nlegal authorities for expedited removal eligibility or explain how it was directing DHS components \nto interpret and apply them. Instead, the Memorandum merely directed that “actions contemplated \nby this memorandum shall be taken in a manner consistent with the applicable statutes, regulations, \nand court orders.” January 23 Huffman Memorandum at 2. The question, though, is which statutes \nand regulations did the agency believe to be applicable? Nor is the Memorandum’s reference to \n“enforcement discretion” sufficient. Even guidance documents that give room for enforcement \ndiscretion must explain their legal basis and reasoning. See, e.g., Regents, 591 U.S. at 26–28. \nWithout any such explanation of the legal lines the Memorandum was drawing, the Court cannot \n“evaluate the agency’s rationale at the time of decision.” Pension Ben. Guar. Corp., 496 U.S. at \n654. \nTake next the February 18 ICE Directive, which was similarly legally opaque. That \ndocument’s section on expedited removal of parolees cited no legal authorities whatsoever besides \nthe  inadmissibility  criteria  of  sections  1182(a)(6)(C)  and  1182(a)(7).  See  February  18  ICE \nDirective at 1. Those authorities say nothing about eligibility of parolees to expedited removal. \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 70 of 84\nThe Directive suggested, by its use of the term “paroled arriving aliens,” that it was invoking the \nagency’s definition of “arriving aliens” under 8 C.F.R. § 1.2, but it did not say so explicitly. So, \ntoo, did its statement that “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to process such aliens for \n[expedited removal].” Id. That is true of expedited removal under the Arriving Aliens Provision \nbut not the Designation Provision. On its own, perhaps the February 18 ICE Directive’s use of the \nregulatorily defined term sufficed to indicate that Directive’s legal authority. \nThings get considerably murkier, though, when looking to the third Challenged Action, the \nMarch 25 CHNV Termination Notice. There, DHS stated that “[e]xpedited removal is available \nonly when an alien has not been continuously present in the United States for at least the two years \npreceding the date of the inadmissibility determination.” March 25 CHNV Termination Notice at \n13619  (citing  8  U.S.C.  § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II)26;  8  C.F.R.  § 235.3).  That  is  true  under  the \nDesignation Provision but not the Arriving Aliens Provision. Indeed, under the agency’s own \ninterpretation of its statutory authority, that statement is flat wrong. And yet, that statement played \nan important role in DHS’s explanation for why it chose to terminate the CHNV Parole Programs \nand begin subjecting those parolees to expedited removal: it was on the clock. See id. (“If DHS \nwere to allow the CHNV parolee population to remain for the full duration of their two-year parole, \nDHS would be compelled to place a greater proportion of this population in section 240 removal \nproceedings to effectuate their removal . . . .”); id. at 13620 (“Any lengthening of the wind-down \nperiod will increase the likelihood that additional CHNV parolees are no longer subject to \nexpedited removal.”). DHS gave no explanation for departing from its longstanding interpretation \nof its statutory authority—no less from the stated policy in the February 18 ICE Directive issued \njust five weeks prior.  \n \n26 The Termination Notice actually cites “8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(iii)(II),” but that appears to be a typo because a \nprovision with that numbering does not exist. \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 71 of 84\nTaking the three Challenged Actions together, DHS’s policy appears to be both that it must \nfirst terminate a noncitizen’s parole before subjecting them to expedited removal, see January 23 \nHuffman Memorandum at 2, and that it can subject even active parolees to expedited removal, see \nFebruary 18 ICE Directive at 1. The agency believes both that it must (and should) subject former \nparolees to expedited removal within two years of the beginning of their continuous presence, see \nMarch 25 CHNV Termination Notice at 13619, and that it is under “no time limit,” February 18 \nICE Directive at 1. Call it Schrödinger’s legal justification. But unlike a quantum particle, an \nagency’s legal justification cannot be two opposing things at once. Rather “unacknowledged and \nunexplained inconsistency,” including of the agency’s legal conclusions, “is the hallmark of \narbitrary and capricious decision-making.” Bauer, 325 F. Supp. 3d at 109; see also FCC v. Fox \nTelevision Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (“[T]he requirement that an agency provide \nreasoned explanation for its action would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it is \nchanging position. An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior policy sub silentio or \nsimply disregard rules that are still on the books.” (emphasis in original)); Johnson v. Copyright \nRoyalty Bd., 969 F.3d 363, 389–91 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (remanding an agency decision that “failed to \nexplain the legal authority” for a change in position).  \nIn  view  of  these  inconsistencies,  Defendants’  remaining  arguments  here  fall  apart. \nDefendants’ claim that the Challenged Actions do not “purport to justify applying expedited \nremoval to parolees” because “this authority has already existed since at least 1997,” ECF 26 at 51, \nmight make sense if the Challenged  Actions clearly and consistently relied upon the 1997 \nregulatory definition of “arriving alien.” But they did not. Instead, at various points, the Challenged \nActions implicitly abjured reliance on that definition, if not outright contradicted it. See, e.g., \nMarch 25 CHNV Termination Notice at 13619. Similarly, the flatly incorrect (under DHS’s \n71 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 72 of 84\nregulation) legal justification in the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice belies Defendants’ claim \nthat the document merely “rel[ied] on an additional source of authority for applying expedited \nremoval—the  designation  authority.”  Id.  at 52  (emphasis  in  original).  At  best,  Defendants’ \nexplanation is an “impermissible post hoc rationalization[]”; more accurately, it is nonsensical. \nRegents, 591 U.S. at 22; see Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (“[T]he \npost hoc rationalizations of the agency or the parties to this litigation cannot serve as a sufficient \npredicate for agency action.”).  \nFinally, Defendants’ claim that none of this rational-decision-making stuff matters because \nDHS has unreviewable discretion to choose between expedited removal and section 240 removal \nproceedings ignores the statutory scheme. Section 1252(e)(3)(A) permits challenges to written \npolicy directives, guidelines, and procedures implementing section 1225(b)’s expedited removal \nsystem. As already established, the Challenged Actions fall into that category. Thus, they are by \nCongress’s clear command “[j]udicial[ly] review[able].” 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A). Defendants’ \nargument to the contrary amounts to little more than a mad-libs of Executive-speak untethered to \nthe laws Congress enacted. See ECF 26 at 54–55 (“The agency has unfettered discretion over \nwhether to initiate proceedings, . . . and if so, to choose between removal proceedings, and there \nis no judicially manageable standard in the INA for this Court to review such decisions.”); id. at \n55 (“DHS need not provide extensive justification for utilizing its long-established enforcement \nauthority, particularly where that decision concerns prosecutorial charging choices traditionally \nwithin the unreviewable discretion of the Executive Branch.”). \nPlaintiffs  raise  other  important  questions,  such  as  whether  the  Challenged  Actions \nsufficiently assessed reasonable alternatives and reliance interests. But the Challenged Actions’ \nscattershot  legal  explanations  suffice  to  render  them  likely  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  this \n72 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 73 of 84\npreliminary posture. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their arbitrary \nand capricious claim. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Members Face Irreparable Harm \nIn addition to showing a likelihood of success on the merits, Plaintiffs must also establish \nthat they face irreparable injury absent the requested preliminary relief. Nat’l Min. Ass’n v. \nJackson, 768 F. Supp. 2d 34, 50 (D.D.C. 2011); Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297. To constitute \nirreparable injury, the injury “must be ‘both certain and great,’ ‘actual and not theoretical,’ ‘beyond \nremediation,’ and ‘of such imminence that there is a clear and present need for equitable relief to \nprevent irreparable harm.’” Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA., 787 F.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (quoting Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297) (emphasis in original).  \nPlaintiffs offer evidence of four categories of ongoing or imminent irreparable harm to \ntheir members and others like them: (1) lack of opportunity to apply for immigration relief in \nexpedited removal, as compared to section 240 removal proceedings; (2) lack of meaningful \nprocess in expedited removal, including lack of judicial review and limited access to counsel; \n(3) risks of persecution and death if/when noncitizens subject to expedited removal are removed; \nand (4) detention and family separation during expedited removal proceedings. ECF 22-1 at 36–\n44.  \nDefendants contest each category. They claim that Plaintiffs’ members’ lack of ability to \npursue immigration relief (besides asylum) in expedited removal does not impose irreparable harm \nbecause noncitizens can pursue an alternative, consular processing, outside of the United States at \na U.S. embassy or consulate. ECF 26 at 59. And anyway, Defendants assert, none of Plaintiffs’ \nmembers  described  in  Plaintiffs’  declarations  both  (a)  are  currently  in  expedited  removal \nproceedings and (b) have a pending application for adjustment of status. Id. at 59–60. As to the \n73 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 74 of 84\nextent of the process under expedited removal, Defendants insist that the credible fear screening \nprocess suffices to permit asylum-seekers to make such a claim, that the Supreme Court has \n“upheld the constitutionality” of this process, and that multiple instances recounted in Plaintiffs’ \nown declarations show the effectiveness of those screenings. Id. at 56–58 (citing Thuraissigiam, \n591 U.S. at 109–10). Defendants also point to the D.C. Circuit’s decision upholding expedited \nremoval and “rejecting arguments based on many of these alleged [procedural] flaws” that \nPlaintiffs raise. Id. at 60 (citing AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 52–60, aff ’d, 199 F.3d at 1357). Further, \nDefendants insist that any irreparable harm from expedited removal besides fear of persecution or \ndeath (e.g., detention, family separation, a bar on returning to the United States) applies equally \nunder section 240 removal and therefore cannot be attributed to the Challenged Actions. Id. at 58–\n59. Finally, Defendants hark back to the Supreme Court’s stay order in Noem v. Doe, which they \nsay implicitly rejected similar arguments of irreparable injury in that case. Id. at 61 (citing Doe, \n145 S. Ct. 1524).  \nDefendants  vastly  understate  Plaintiffs’  evidence  of  irreparable  injury.  Summarized, \nPlaintiffs’ asserted irreparable injuries fall into two buckets: (1) the risk of erroneous removal \narising from lack of meaningful process, whether as to asylum-based claims or other claims for \nimmigration relief; and (2) injuries resulting from the fact of being in expedited removal, such as \ndetention in far-flung facilities and family separation during such detention. As to the first bucket, \nPlaintiffs present unrebutted evidence that expedited removal proceedings lack as thorough \nprocedures as section 240 procedures and likely result in more wrongful removals. See, e.g., ECF \n22-1 at 39 n.15 (citing U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Report on Asylum Seekers in \nExpedited  Removal:  Volume  I:  Findings  &  Recommendations  4,  10  (2005), \nhttps://perma.cc/56WL-6VQC; U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Barriers to Protection: \n74 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 75 of 84\nThe Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Expedited Removal 2–3 (2016), https://perma.cc/67CM-\nYFY7; U.S. Comm’n on Int’l Religious Freedom, Barriers to Protection as of 2024: Updated \nRecommendations  on  Asylum  Seekers  in  Expedited  Removal  2–3,  10–11  (2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/YEE4-XQM3); ECF 22-7 ¶ 12 (discussing CHIRLA member’s “limited rights \nand lack of meaningful process provided in the credible fear process, including barriers to \naccessing counsel and evidence since he is detained,” relative to his section 240 proceedings); ECF \n22-10 ¶¶ 9–10 (discussing CASA member’s lack of notice about the expedited removal process \nand inability to gather evidence to support his asylum claim from his detention facility far from \nhis home and “to regularly communicate with his attorney”); ECF 22-16 ¶ 12 (discussing parolee’s \ninability to prepare with his attorney and family, or to present expert testimony, for his credible \nfear interview in expedited removal, unlike section 240 removal, which his attorney suggests \nresulted in him receiving a negative credible fear determination). And although Defendants note \nthat some of the parolees discussed in the declarations are not identified as members of one of the \nPlaintiff organizations, several others who have faced or are currently facing these and similar \nprocedural deficiencies are so identified. See, e.g., ECF 22-7 ¶ 2; ECF 22-10 ¶ 2; ECF 22-13 ¶ 2.  \nDefendants’  legal  arguments  are  similarly  unavailing.  It  is  well  established  that  a \nnoncitizen’s removal to a country where they face persecution, torture, or death constitutes \nirreparable harm. Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733–34 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  So, too, \ndoes the “delta between what the law requires with respect to the traditional [section 240] process \nand” the truncated procedures in the expedited removal context. Make the Rd. New York v. \nMcAleenan, 405 F. Supp. 3d 1, 62 (D.D.C. 2019) (K.B. Jackson, J.), rev’d on other grounds and \nremanded sub nom. Make the Rd., 962 F.3d 612; accord Kiakombua, 498 F. Supp. 3d at 57. All \nDefendants offer in response are cases in which both the Supreme Court and the D.C. Circuit held \n75 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 76 of 84\nthat the expedited removal procedures Congress created could not be challenged on due-process \ngrounds because the plaintiffs in those cases had no cognizable due process right to a certain \nremoval procedure. See Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. at 138–39; AILA, 18 F. Supp. 2d at 58–60. But \nPlaintiffs do not raise a constitutional due process claim here. Nor do Plaintiffs argue that the \nexpedited removal procedures themselves violate IIRAIRA, as in AILA, see 18 F. Supp. 2d at 52–\n57; instead, they argue that parolees should not be subject to those procedures, compliant with \nIIRAIRA or not, at all. In the irreparable injury analysis, the Court “assumes, without deciding, \nthat the movant has demonstrated a likelihood that the non-movant’s conduct violates the law.” \nChaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 303. On the assumption (as the Court found above) that parolees likely \nare not subject to expedited removal under IIRAIRA, the question is just whether expedited \nremoval procedures avert the irreparable injuries of wrongful removal to the same degree as section \n240 procedures. Neither Thuraissigiam nor AILA stands for that proposition. And Plaintiffs’ \nevidence shows the opposite. \nPlaintiffs’ asserted irreparable injuries from detention and family separation during the \nexpedited removal process also withstand Defendants’ attacks. Plaintiffs’ declarations are replete \nwith uncontested evidence that their members and other parolees have (a) been detained pursuant \nto explicit or apparent expedited removal proceedings, when they were previously undergoing \nsection 240 proceedings without being detained, (b) often been detained in far-flung locations \naway from their families and attorneys, (c) faced poor conditions in detention more commonly \nassociated with expedited removal facilities than others, and (d) suffered mental and physical \nhealth challenges as a result of their detention. ECF 22-1 at 43–44; see, e.g., ECF 22-13 ¶¶ 8, 10, \n20 (CASA member separated from his mother and suffering from a chronic health condition for \nwhich he is not receiving the treatment in detention that he was able to receive while in section \n76 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 77 of 84\n240 proceedings); ECF 22-5 ¶¶ 7–10 (discussing separation of parolee from his wife and son, who \nremained non-detained and in section 240 removal when he was sent to expedited removal, \ndetained, and held for weeks pending a credible fear interview that as of the declaration had still \nnot occurred); ECF 22-9 ¶ 14 (overcrowded conditions where detainees are “forc[ed] . . . to sleep \non the floor,” in out-of-state detention far from counsel); ECF 22-6 ¶¶ 17–20 (discussing detention \nin remote locations and that those in expedited removal face fewer options to avoid detention than \nin section 240 proceedings). Defendants’ response that section 240 proceedings can also involve \ndetention and family separation do not address—much less refute—Plaintiffs’ evidence that, in \nmany of the cases Plaintiffs identify, parolees were not detained or separated from their families \nuntil after (or just before) their section 240 proceedings were terminated and expedited removal \nproceedings begun. See ECF 26 at 58.  \nFinally, Defendants’ reliance once again on the Supreme Court’s order in Noem v. Doe, \n145 S. Ct. 1524, falls flat for the same reason as before: without any explanation from the Supreme \nCourt for its decision, this Court simply cannot apply it to any case besides the single case it \n(preliminarily) decided. \nC.  The Balance of the Equities and the Public Interest Favor a Stay \nOn the final two stay factors, which merge here, Defendants’ arguments hold little weight. \nFirst, Defendants claim that a stay of the Challenged Actions would “prevent DHS from applying \nexpedited removal to potentially hundreds of thousands of paroled aliens whose parole DHS is \nseeking to revoke or has revoked, thereby frustrating DHS’s ability to quickly remove these \naliens.” ECF 26 at 61. In addition, a stay would “impose substantial administrative burdens and \ntax agency resources by requiring DHS to initiate and litigate [section 240 proceedings] if it chose \nto  pursue  removal.”  Id.  And  because  of  the  “significance  of  expedited  removal  to  the \n77 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 78 of 84\nGovernment’s enforcement efforts,” the harm to the Government “would be particularly acute.” \nId. Those claims are all consistent with the record before the Court (and they undermine other \naspects of Defendants’ arguments, particularly their redressability objection). But subjecting \nparolees to expedited removal likely violates the law, and “there is generally no public interest in \nthe perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” Shawnee Tribe v. Mnuchin, 984 F.3d 94, 102 (D.C. \nCir. 2021) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  \nMoreover, while the Supreme Court has said that “[t]here is always a public interest in \nprompt execution of removal orders” because “[t]he continued presence of an alien lawfully \ndeemed removable undermines the streamlined removal proceedings [IIRAIRA] established,” \nNken, 556 U.S. at 436, section 240 proceedings are the main “streamlined” removal proceedings \nthat IIRAIRA established, H.R. Rep. 104-469, 12, 107–08. Similarly, the Government’s other case \non this point, Lucacela v. Reno, also discusses the “clear public interest (as expressed by Congress) \nin deporting illegal aliens without delay” in the context, it appears, of section 240 removal \nproceedings rather than expedited removal proceedings. 161 F.3d 1055, 1059 (7th Cir. 1998). \nUnder those cases, then, the public’s interest in removal of unauthorized immigrants is fully \nvindicated by section 240 proceedings and does not require expedited removal—much less \nexpedited removal in violation of the substantive statute and the APA. What’s more, “the public \nhas an interest in ‘preventing [noncitizens] from being wrongfully removed, particularly to \ncountries where they are likely to face substantial harm.’” A.B.-B. v. Morgan, 548 F. Supp. 3d 209, \n222 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Nken, 556 U.S. at 436).  \nDefendants next point to “the Executive Branch’s constitutional and statutory authority \nover immigration and the admission and removal of aliens,” into which they say the requested stay \nwould “severe[ly] intru[de].” ECF 26 at 62. Yet, the immigration system is a responsibility shared \n78 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 79 of 84\nby the Executive and Legislative branches. On some questions, in fact, Congress’s power over \nimmigration is “plenary.” Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 225 (1982) (“The Constitution grants \nCongress the power to ‘establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization.’ Drawing upon this power, \nupon its plenary authority with respect to foreign relations and international commerce, and upon \nthe inherent power of a sovereign to close its borders, Congress has developed a complex scheme \ngoverning admission to our Nation and status within our borders.” (quoting U.S. Const. Art. I., \n§ 8, cl. 4)). As relevant here, it is Congress, not the President, that “specifie[s] which aliens may \nbe removed from the United States and the procedures for doing so.” Arizona v. United States, 567 \nU.S. 387, 396 (2012). When the Executive Branch circumvents Congress’s decision, it undermines \nthat separation of powers. A court order staying such a circumvention, by contrast, vindicates it.27  \nDefendants try one final argument: “[t]he government has a substantial interest in carrying \nout the President’s policies,” and “vigorous enforcement of the immigration laws and the prompt \nremoval of aliens not entitled to remain here is one of the President’s top priorities.” ECF 26 at 62. \nFor support, Defendants cite Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion in chambers in Maryland v. King, \n567 U.S. 1301 (2012) (Roberts, J., in chambers), for the proposition that “[t]he United States \nsuffers a form of irreparable harm to its democratic system when it is prohibited from effectuating \n[the President’s] policies against anyone anywhere in the Nation.” ECF 26 at 62. But the actual \nquote from the case says something else: “Any time a State is enjoined by a court from effectuating \nstatutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.” King, 567 \n \n27 Defendants attempt, once again, to fall back on Justice O’Connor’s opinion in Legalization Assistance Project, \nwhich found that the balance of the equities tipped in favor of staying a lower-court decision that constituted an \n“improper intrusion by a federal court into the workings of a coordinate branch of Government.” 510 U.S. at 1306 \n(O’Connor, J., in chambers). But there, the lower-court’s decision was an “improper intrusion” because it permitted a \nsuit by plaintiffs without prudential standing. See id. (“Moreover, if the above analysis is correct the order is not \nmerely an erroneous adjudication of a lawsuit between private litigants, but an improper intrusion . . . .” (emphasis \nadded)) Here, by contrast, this Court follows the D.C. Circuit in holding that Plaintiffs here do fall within the zone of \ninterests, and thus this order is no “improper intrusion” under Justice O’Connor’s reasoning.  \n79 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 80 of 84\nU.S. at 1303 (quoting New Motor Vehicle Bd. of California v. Orrin W. Fox Co., 434 U.S. 1345, \n1351 (1977) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers)). That case does not stand for the proposition that the \npublic has an interest in carrying out presidential policies that violate statutes. Rather, it affirms \nthe  public  interest  in  enforcement  of  duly  enacted  statutes—statutes  like  IIRAIRA  and  its \nlimitations on which noncitizens may be subject to expedited removal.  \nThis Court will  not “endorse[] the radical proposition that the President is harmed, \nirreparably, whenever he cannot do something he wants to do, even if what he wants to do is break \nthe law.” Trump v. CASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2581 (2025) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \nDefendants point to no case endorsing such a proposition. Indeed, in CASA, the Court’s majority \nrejected that proposition, too.28 The Executive Branch must follow duly enacted laws or ask \nCongress to change them, and the public has a strong interest in seeing that principle upheld.  \nAll told, the balance of the equities and the public interest, like the other stay factors, weigh \nin favor of Plaintiffs’ requested relief. \nD.  A Stay as to All Noncitizens Paroled into the United States, Not Just Plaintiffs’ \nMembers, Is Standard and Appropriate, and No Bond Is Required. \nBecause all four factors weigh in favor of a stay, the Court will grant a stay of the \nChallenged Actions. Still, Defendants ask that if this Court does so, it limit the stay to Plaintiffs’ \n“members who [Plaintiffs] can identify as being affected by the challenged agency actions.” ECF \n26 at 64. Yet, as the D.C. Circuit has repeatedly held, vacatur of the agency action—not merely \nexempting plaintiffs from the agency action— is the normal remedy under APA section 706. Nat’l \n \n28 The CASA majority disclaimed any reliance on the “radical proposition” alleged in Justice Sotomayor’s dissent. \nInstead, the Court said the irreparable harm came not from the President being unable to enforce the Birthright \nCitizenship Order but from “the District Courts’ entry of injunctions that likely exceed the authority conferred by the \nJudiciary Act.” CASA, 145 S. Ct. at 2562; see also id. (“The dissent is wrong to say, however, that a stay applicant \ncannot demonstrate irreparable harm from a threshold error without also showing that, at the end of the day, it will \nprevail on the underlying merits.”). The majority did not dispute that the proposition Justice Sotomayor described is \nindeed a “radical” one. Id. at 2581 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \n80 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 81 of 84\nMin. Ass’n v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 145 F.3d 1399, 1409 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Courts in this and \nother circuits have applied that same rule to section 705 stays. See, e.g., Career Colls. & Schs. of \nTex. v. U. S. Dep’t of Educ., 98 F.4th 220, 255 (5th Cir. 2024), cert. granted in part sub nom. Dep’t \nof Educ. v. Career Colls. & Schs. of Tex., 145 S. Ct. 1039 (2025); Dist. of Columbia v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Agric., 444 F. Supp. 3d at 48; Cabrera, 2025 WL 2092026, at *8. Those decisions track the text \nof section 705, which authorizes the reviewing court to “postpone the effective date of an agency \naction or preserve status or rights” full stop, not only as to plaintiffs before the court. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 705. Against that authority, Defendants provide no case in which a court has granted a section \n705 stay only as to the plaintiffs, rather than as against the Government and its enforcement of the \nchallenged agency action in general. \nDefendants do attempt to argue, also without any supporting caselaw, that section 705 stays \nmust be limited to the plaintiffs because they may only be granted “to the extent necessary to \nprevent irreparable injury.” 5 U.S.C. § 705. But the statue does not say “to the extent necessary to \nprevent irreparable injury to the plaintiffs” or “to the challengers of the agency action.” And here, \nPlaintiffs have established irreparable injury to their members and to “others similarly situated.” \nECF 22-1 at 19; see also id. at 36 (discussing irreparable injury to “Plaintiffs’ members and other \nnoncitizens around the country who were paroled into the United States and are now being \nprocessed for expedited removal”). Without more, Defendants’ perfunctory textual analysis cannot \novercome the weight of the statutory text and the caselaw. \nDefendants also err in relying on CASA, which expressly reserved the question of relief \nunder section 706. See 145 S. Ct. at 2554 n.10 (“Nothing we say today resolves the distinct \nquestion whether the Administrative Procedure Act authorizes federal courts to vacate federal \nagency action.”). Accordingly, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurrence highlighted that, even after \n81 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 82 of 84\nCASA, “plaintiffs may ask a court to preliminarily ‘set aside’ a new agency rule” “in cases under \nthe Administrative Procedure Act.” Id. at 2567 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). That is precisely what \nPlaintiffs ask this Court to do here, and the Court has the power to do so under current precedent. \nFinally, it is worth pausing on the significant practical challenges and limited benefits that \nwould result from a stay limited to Plaintiffs’ members. By design, the expedited removal process \noffers  few  opportunities  to  raise  objections  to  eligibility  for  removal,  or  to  get  a  neutral \nadjudicator’s eyes on such objections. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ cited studies and declarations show \nthat the agencies struggle even to follow the limited procedures that exist—and that individuals in \nexpedited removal are often unaware of their rights. See supra Section IV.B. Now imagine the \nExecutive Branch having to implement, across every immigration facility and officer nationwide, \nadditional procedures to determine whether individuals in expedited removal are members of one \nof the Plaintiff organizations. Recall that individuals in expedited removal lack ready access to \ntheir  belongings,  families,  or  counsel.  See  id.  Would  they  be  expected  to  carry  around  a \nmembership card everywhere they went, in case they were picked up for expedited removal? How \nwould the agency verify their membership? These problems may be surmountable, but Defendants \ndo not explain how. On the flip side, one of the key practical benefits of plaintiff-confined relief, \npercolation of suits across different districts and circuits, would not materialize here. See CASA, \n145 S. Ct. at 2584 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (describing the percolation argument). Instead, under \nsection 1252(e)(3)(A), all suits like this one challenging the expedited removal system must be \nbrought in this District. In the end, then, the Court sees numerous reasons to stay the Challenged \nActions as to all noncitizens paroled into the United States at any point in time and few reasons \nnot to.  \n82 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 83 of 84\nDefendants also ask the Court to, if it grants relief, require Plaintiffs to put forward a bond \npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c). That rule requires the Court when issuing a \npreliminary injunction or temporary restraining order to order the movant to “give[] security in an \namount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found \nto have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). Yet, Plaintiffs here seek a \nstay under APA section 705, which is neither a preliminary injunction nor a temporary restraining \norder. Mich. Citizens for an Indep. Press v. Thornburgh, No. 88-CV-2322, 1988 WL 90388, at *8 \nn.12  (D.D.C.  Aug.  17,  1988)  (“[T]he  APA  stay  provision  does  not  impose  a  security \nrequirement.”). Further, even if a section 705 stay did require bond in a “proper” amount, that \nproper amount would be zero dollars here because bond would “impose a substantial hardship on \nthe  Plaintiffs”  and  “undesirably  deter  individuals  from  enforcing  their  procedural  rights  to \nchallenge agency action affecting immigration decisions.” See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c); Doe, 2025 \nWL 1099602, at *20 n.33.  \nOne last note on remedy: The March 25 CHNV Termination Notice plainly does more than \nimplement  the  expedited  removal  statute.  It  also  terminates  the  CHNV  Parole  Programs. \nAppropriately, Plaintiffs do not ask the Court to stay that Notice in its entirety, but instead ask that \nthe Court stay the Notice, like the other Challenged Actions, only “insofar as [it] subject[s] \nindividuals who have previously been granted parole at ports of entry to expedited removal.” ECF \n22-1 at 38; ECF 22-18 at 1 (Proposed Order). The Court does so today. To be clear, in other words, \nthe Court is not staying termination of the CHNV Parole Programs. Instead, the Court’s order “re-\nestablish[es] the status quo absent the unlawful agency action,” which was that CHNV Parole \nProgram parolees were generally not subject to expedited removal (unless they were already \nsubject to one of the other two Challenged Actions, which are also stayed). Texas, 40 F.4th at 220.  \n83 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 41     Filed 08/01/25     Page 84 of 84\nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for a stay of agency action, ECF 22, is \nGRANTED. The Challenged Actions (the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE \nDirective, and March 25 CHNV Termination Notice) are hereby STAYED, pending conclusion \nof these review proceedings, to the extent the Challenged Actions subject to expedited removal \nindividuals who have been, at any time, paroled into the United States at a point of entry.  \nA separate order accompanies this memorandum opinion. \n \nSO ORDERED.  \n                       __________________________ \n              JIA M.

Case No.: 1:25-cv-0872 \n   \nKRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of \n \nHomeland Security, et al., \n \n  Defendants. \nFIRST AMENDED COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This  lawsuit  challenges  the  Trump  administration’s  various  agency  policies \nexpanding expedited removal to categorically expose hundreds of thousands of people who entered \nthe country legally through humanitarian parole processes to summary deportation. \n2.  Expedited removal is an extraordinary procedure that allows removal from the \nUnited States with little to no due process. While expedited removal has historically been used \nonly for people in the process of seeking admission at a port of entry, or for people encountered in \nthe country a short time after entry and within 100 miles of a land border who had “not been \nadmitted or paroled into the United States,” on January 21, the administration decided to expand \nthe scope of expedited removal to include individuals throughout the United States who have been \ncontinuously present here for less than two years. \n3.  On January 23, the administration issued a memorandum implementing the above \nexpansion of expedited removal by directing agency personnel to “consider” using the fast-track \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 2 of 55\n \nremoval authority on any noncitizen eligible for processing through expedited removal, including \nindividuals who had previously been granted parole, including by terminating active removal \nproceedings and any active parole status (the “January 23 Huffman Memorandum”). \n4.  Shortly  thereafter,  on  February  18,  the  administration  issued  a  directive  that \npurports to expose individuals who have been paroled into the country at ports of entry and who \ndo not have a pending asylum application to the threat of expedited removal, with “no time limit \non  the  ability  to  process  such  aliens  for  ER  [expedited  removal]”  (the  “February  18  ICE \nDirective”). \n5.  The administration also issued a series of commands, both public and private, \nterminating  various  humanitarian  parole  programs  under  which  hundreds  of  thousands  of \nindividuals fleeing turmoil in their own countries have been lawfully allowed to enter the United \nstates for periods of up to two years, permitting them to live and work safely for the duration of \ntheir authorized period of parole or any subsequent lawful authorized stay, such as during the \nconsideration or granting of another immigration filing. The administration additionally ended the \nuse of CBP One, a mobile application, which allowed certain individuals outside the country, also \nfleeing turmoil in their home countries, to schedule appointments to appear at certain land ports of \nentry to be inspected and considered for parole. Many CBP One parolees were also placed in \nordinary removal proceedings, on a case-by-case basis, at the same time that they were granted \nparole. All of these paroled individuals have been able to apply for work authorization and, when \neligible, for immigration benefits, such as asylum, Temporary Protected Status (“TPS”), or other \nforms of relief, and in some circumstances could re-apply for another period of parole. \n6.  On March 25, the administration published a Federal Register Notice that formally \nterminated four such humanitarian parole processes for nationals of Cuba, Haiti. Nicaragua, and \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 3 of 55\n \nVenezuela (the “CHNV” parole processes) and purported to categorically terminate all grants of \nparole previously extended to CHNV nationals (“the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice”). In \nthis Notice, the administration again discussed the application of expedited removal to these \nparolees and observed that expedited removal only can be used with respect to individuals who \nhave been continuously present in the country for less than two years. The March 25 CHNV \nTermination Notice is inconsistent with the February 18 directive not only with respect to whether \nindividuals like CHNV parolees may be processed for expedited removal without any time limit, \nbut more fundamentally with respect to the legal basis for exposing them to expedited removal at \nall.  \n7.  Starting around May 21, 2025—the same day that White House Deputy Chief of \nStaff  Stephen  Miller  was  reported  to  have  demanded  that  U.S.  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (“ICE”) leadership meet high quotas for detentions and removals, pressuring them to \ngo to locations such as Home Depot and 7 Eleven to fulfill quotas without regard to individuals’ \ncriminal  history—Plaintiffs,  attorneys,  and  noncitizens  nationwide  began  reporting  and \nexperiencing  the  widespread  implementation  of  the  administration’s  policies  targeting  for \nexpedited removal individuals who had been previously paroled into the United States at ports of \nentry.  \n8.  In immigration courtrooms around the country, ICE Trial Attorneys representing \nthe  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”)  started  to  file  motions  to  dismiss  removal \nproceedings  against  certain  noncitizens  who  were  appearing  for  routine  hearings,  including \nnoncitizens who had been inspected and paroled into the United States at a land port of entry during \nan appointment secured through DHS’s CBP One mobile application. Some motions were filed in \nwriting; others, orally. Some motions disclosed that ICE intended to process the noncitizens for \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 4 of 55\n \nexpedited removal upon dismissal of proceedings and some made no mention of plans to continue \npursuing removal. \n9.  At the conclusion of proceedings, where the immigration judge had granted the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss, ICE officers waiting outside the courtroom arrested these \nnoncitizens without warning, and without a warrant of any kind.  \n10.  Many of those arrested were (and many remain) wholly unaware of why they are \ndetained or that they are going to be processed for expedited removal. Many had also already \nappeared for multiple prior court hearings without being detained, and many had requests for \nimmigration relief pending with the immigration court or with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (USCIS). \n11.  Those  arrested  are  often  being  separated  from  family—sometimes  physically \npulled away from loved ones in sight of the courtroom—and detained in remote immigration \ndetention  facilities,  facing  rapid  deportation  with  limited  access  to  counsel  and  without  a \nmeaningful opportunity to present claims for relief for which they are eligible. \n12.  The simultaneous expansion of expedited removal in various and inconsistent ways \nand the attempted en masse termination of hundreds of thousands of previously-issued grants of \nparole, combined with the recent rise in the use of expedited removal on the ground, including \nagainst noncitizens who have been paroled into the country at ports of entry, place these parole \nrecipients at imminent risk of being uprooted from this country and removed without basic due \nprocess rights and in violation of precise statutory limits. \n13.  In addition to courthouse arrests, there have been sweeping worksite raids taking \nplace across the country, from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, California, including significant \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 5 of 55\n \nenforcement actions taking place in Los Angeles in June 2025. These actions further reinforce that \nparole beneficiaries are at imminent risk of expedited removal and all its concomitant harms. \n14.  Without relief from this Court, individuals who have lawfully been granted parole \nand are living and working throughout the United States—many with families—are at significant \nrisk of being arrested, detained, and removed from the country through a process that not only \nlacks basic procedural safeguards (including judicial review), but that cannot even be applied to \nthem legally. \n15.  Plaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”), UndocuBlack \nNetwork  (“UndocuBlack”),  and  CASA,  Inc.  (“CASA”)  are  nonprofit,  membership-based, \nimmigrant rights organizations whose work, services, and programming are guided by their \nmembers. Each group’s members include noncitizens subject to expedited removal under the \npolicies challenged in this litigation who are at risk of being arrested or detained at any point.  \n16.  CHIRLA’s members include newly arrived migrant families who fled persecution, \ntorture, and the threat of death, and who sought safety in the United States using the CBP One \nmobile application. Although granted parole and permitted to enter the country temporarily with \nthe opportunity of applying for various forms of protection, these members are now faced with the \npossibility of being sent back to the dangers they fled without notice and a full opportunity to \nsecure relief for which they are eligible. One CHIRLA member, for example, is an Afghan man \nwho fled under fear of execution by the Taliban and attacks by ISIS due to his ethnicity, religion, \nand prior activism. If he is rapidly deported to Afghanistan, he would be in immediate danger of \nbodily injury and death, as well as severe limits to his freedoms of religion, expression, and \nmovement.  \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 6 of 55\n \n17.  UndocuBlack’s members include Black migrants who were granted parole through \nthe CHNV parole processes or after securing an appointment at a land port of entry through the \nCBP One mobile application. Since their entry into the country, these members have been targeted \nconstantly in the United States by anti-Black, anti-Haitian violence, and are plagued by the \nconstant fear of losing their parole and being subjected to rapid deportation back to persecution \nand danger in Haiti. One of these members, a Haitian man who fled political persecution in his \nhome country, describes feeling now under the administration’s expedited removal directives like \nhe is “one second away from losing everything, including [his] life.”  \n18.  CASA’s members include both individuals who were sponsored to come to the \nUnited States through the CHNV parole processes and individuals who came through using the \nCBP One mobile application, and they are experiencing widespread anxiety, fear, and confusion \nabout the administration’s new policies on parole and expedited removal. One Venezuelan CASA \nmember was granted TPS after he came to the United States on CHNV parole, but because of the \nadministration’s termination of Venezuelan TPS and expansion of expedited removal to apply to \nparoled individuals, he is now at risk of soon being subjected to expedited removal and separated \nfrom his young child.  \n19.  Plaintiffs seek a declaration that the application of expedited removal under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) to individuals like their members who have previously been granted parole \nat a port of entry is unlawful; an injunction prohibiting the Department of Homeland Security \n(“DHS”) from continuing to apply its unlawful construction of the statute to expose individuals \nwho have previously been granted parole at a port of entry to the threat of expedited removal; and \nvacatur of agency actions taken pursuant the agency’s erroneous understanding of the law. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 7 of 55\n \n20.  There are other pending cases challenging (1) the expansion of expedited removal \nto individuals in the interior of the country who have lived here for less than two years and (2) the \ntermination  of  various  humanitarian  parole  programs.  This  case  is  largely  focused  on  the \nintersection of those issues to ensure that people who were previously granted parole at a port of \nentry and have been living here continuously since that time are not subject to summary expulsion \nonce they have been stripped of parole status or their period of parole has expired. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n21.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3). Section \n1252(e)(3) provides jurisdiction in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for \nan action challenging as unlawful “a written policy directive, written policy guidance, or written \nprocedure” implementing the expedited removal statute. This Court additionally has jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331. \n22.  Venue is proper in this District because 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(A) requires that all \nSection 1252(e)(3) actions be brought in the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia. In addition, venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because a substantial part of \nthe events or omissions giving rise to this action occurred in this District and Defendants are \nofficers of the United States being sued in their official capacity and reside in the District. \nPARTIES \n23.  Plaintiff Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”) is a nonprofit \nmembership organization headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with ten offices throughout \nCalifornia and a national policy office in Washington, D.C. CHIRLA was founded in 1986, and it \nis the largest statewide immigrant rights organization in California, with approximately 50,597 \nactive members. CHIRLA’s members include noncitizens who entered the United States on some \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 8 of 55\n \nform of humanitarian parole and are subject to and are being harmed by Defendants’ application \nof expedited removal to parolees. \n24.  Plaintiff UndocuBlack Network (“UndocuBlack”) is a nonprofit membership \norganization  incorporated  in  the  District  of  Columbia.  Created  in  2016,  UndocuBlack  is  a \nmultigenerational network of Black immigrants that advocates for and supports Black immigrants \nthrough facilitating access to resources, storytelling, organizing, and community wellness. Since \nits inception, UndocuBlack has provided direct services and support to Haitian migrants who have \nsought protection in the United States as conditions in their home country have deteriorated. \nUndocuBlack has numerous members who are CHNV and CBP One parole beneficiaries from \nHaiti and are subject to and are being harmed by Defendants’ application of expedited removal to \nparolees.  \n25.  Plaintiff CASA, Inc. (“CASA”) is a national nonprofit membership organization \nheadquartered in Langley Park, Maryland, with offices in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and \nGeorgia. Founded in 1985, CASA has more than 173,000 lifetime members from across the United \nStates. CASA’s members are predominantly noncitizens in a variety of immigration statuses, \nincluding members who entered the United States on some form of humanitarian parole and are \nsubject to and are being harmed by Defendants’ application of expedited removal to parolees. \n26.  Defendant Kristi Noem is sued in her official capacity as the Secretary of the U.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), a position to which she was confirmed by the Senate \non January 25, 2025.  \n27.  Defendant Todd M. Lyons is sued in his official capacity as the Acting Director of \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), a component agency of DHS. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 9 of 55\n \n28.  Defendant  Pete  R.  Flores  is  sued  in  his  official  capacity  as  the  Acting \nCommissioner of Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), a component agency of DHS. \n29.  Defendant Angelica Alfonso-Royals is sued in her official capacity as the Acting \nDirector of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), a component agency of DHS. \n30.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is sued in his official capacity as the President of the \nUnited States. He was inaugurated on January 20, 2025. \nBACKGROUND \nThe Statutory Parole Authority \n31.  For more than 70 years, the Nation’s immigration laws have granted the Executive \nthe authority to temporarily parole certain noncitizens into the country. Such grants of parole do \nnot constitute an admission into the country, but for the duration of their parole status, noncitizens \nmay apply for employment authorization and, in some cases, request that their period of parole be \nextended. Like other noncitizens, parolees can also apply for other forms of immigration relief. \nCertain noncitizens who were inspected and paroled into the country also may apply to adjust their \nstatus to lawful permanent residence. \n32.  From 1952 until 1996, the Attorney General was authorized by statute to grant \nparole “for emergent reasons” or “for reasons deemed strictly in the national interest.” Neither \nphrase was defined by Congress. \n33.  Since 1996, the Attorney General (now the Secretary of Homeland Security) has \nbeen authorized by statute to grant parole for “urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public \nbenefit.” 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(5)(A). Again, neither phrase has ever been defined by Congress. \n34.  Humanitarian parole has been a key component of immigration policy since the \nEisenhower administration used it to allow 30,000 Hungarians fleeing Soviet invasion to come to \nthe United States. Parole has been used over 125 times by administrations of both parties—\n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 10 of 55\n \nincluding the first Trump administration—to promote the national interest by advancing various \nhumanitarian, foreign policy, regional security, and migration management objectives. \nExercises of the Statutory Parole Authority \n35.  In  the  past  two  decades  alone,  various  challenges  associated  with  managing \nmigration throughout the Western Hemisphere and at the U.S.-Mexico border, as well as fallout \nand displacement resulting from armed conflicts elsewhere in the world, informed decisions by \nDHS to create a variety of processes to facilitate the consideration of individuals for entry into the \nUnited States for a temporary period of time through the statutory parole authority. \n36.  Operation Allies Welcome. When Afghanistan’s military and government quickly \nfell to the Taliban upon the withdrawal of the U.S. military in August 2021, the U.S. government \nevacuated approximately 124,000 people, including Afghan foreign nationals, from the country \nthrough Operation Allies Welcome. After Afghan foreign national evacuees went through medical, \nsecurity, and other screenings in third countries, approximately 75,000 of them were authorized to \ntravel to the United States and were inspected and paroled into the country. Fewer than 15,000 \nAfghans remain in the United States on current grants of parole by virtue of OAW.  \n37.  Uniting for Ukraine. In the weeks following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in \nFebruary 2022, which marked the start of a war that continues to this day, significant numbers of \nUkrainian nationals began presenting at U.S. ports of entry at the U.S.-Mexico border to request \nhumanitarian protection. Initially, CBP generally paroled these individuals into the country, but in \nthe interest of creating a safe, orderly, and humane pathway for displaced Ukrainian nationals and \ntheir immediate family members in Europe to request entry to the United States, DHS established \nthe Uniting for Ukraine (“U4U”) Parole Process. See Implementation of the Uniting for Ukraine \nParole Process, 87 Fed. Reg. 25040 (Apr. 17, 2022). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 11 of 55\n \n38.  Under U4U, qualifying individuals who passed background and security checks \nand had a financial supporter in the United States would be granted travel authorization to fly to \nthe United States at no expense to the government and present themselves at an interior port of \nentry to be inspected and considered for parole. Approximately 200,000 Ukrainians are in the \nUnited States today by way of parole, the vast majority of whom were granted two years of parole \non a case-by-case basis. Most had preexisting ties to the United States, which is why they came \nhere for refuge when they fled their home country. \n39.  Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan Parole Processes: Faced with a \nmarked increase in the number of Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan nationals arriving \nat the U.S.-Mexico border in fiscal year 2022—and given the difficulties of repatriating CHNV \nnationals to their home countries for a variety of humanitarian and diplomatic reasons—the Biden \nAdministration created for each country a parole process modelled on U4U.  \n40.  In October 2022, DHS established a parole process for certain Venezuelans. See \nImplementation of a Parole Process for Venezuelans, 87 Fed. Reg. 63507 (Oct. 19, 2022). \nApproximately two months later, and in light of the effectiveness of the Venezuelan parole process \nin reducing encounters of Venezuelan nationals between the ports of entry, DHS expanded the \nVenezuelan parole process, see Implementation of Changes to the Parole Process for Venezuelans, \n88 Fed. Reg. 1279 (Jan. 9, 2023), and established similar parole processes for certain Cubans, \nHaitians, and Nicaraguans. See Implementation of a Parole Process for Cubans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1266 \n(Jan. 9, 2023); Implementation of a Parole Process for Haitians, 88 Fed. Reg. 1243 (Jan. 9, 2023); \nImplementation of a Parole Process for Nicaraguans, 88 Fed. Reg. 1255 (Jan. 9, 2023). The Federal \nRegister Notices announcing the CHNV parole processes identified a series of significant public \nbenefits and urgent humanitarian reasons that would be advanced through the use of parole for \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 12 of 55\n \nindividuals availing themselves of the processes and additionally connected the implementation of \nthe processes to ongoing foreign relations initiatives aimed at increasing regional cooperation in \nand capacity to effectively and responsibly manage migration throughout the Western Hemisphere. \n41.  CBP granted parole on a case-by-case basis, for most individuals for two years, to \nover a half million Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans parole through CHNV. \n42.  CBP One: Around the same time the administration created the CHNV parole \nprocesses, it also made available to migrants in Central and Northern Mexico a mobile application \ncalled CBP One, which could be used to schedule an in-person appointment at one of several land \nports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. Upon receiving an appointment, migrants could \npresent themselves at the port of entry for inspection and be considered for parole on a case-by-\ncase basis into the country. Typically, paroled individuals would also be issued a Notice to Appear \nin immigration court where they would be able to pursue any form of immigration relief for which \nthey might be eligible. Together with the new CHNV parole processes, the CBP One appointment \nprocess was designed to facilitate safe and orderly processing of qualified migrants at certain land \nports of entry to reduce the incidence of migrants entering the country without inspection between \nports of entry. \n43.  Central American Minors Parole: Central American Minors (CAM) parole was \ncreated in 2014 as part of a broader initiative that also involved the consideration of certain Central \nAmerican minors and qualifying family members for refugee status and potential resettlement in \nthe United States; individuals determined not to be eligible for refugee status were considered, on \na case-by-case basis, for parole into the United States. The CAM Refugee and Parole Program was \nlargely prompted by the significant number of unaccompanied children from the Northern Triangle \ncountries of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras coming to the U.S.-Mexico border. Under the \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 13 of 55\n \nprogram, certain nationals of those countries who are lawfully present in the United States may \nrequest that their children still in their home countries be considered for refugee status and, in the \nalternative, humanitarian parole, so that their families could be safely reunited. In addition to \nfamily reunification, the CAM program was intended to create a lawful and orderly pathway to \ndisincentivize children from making the overland journey to the U.S.-Mexico border. In addition \nto being dangerous and potentially enriching smugglers, unaccompanied children presenting at the \nborder create unique operational challenges for DHS. CAM parolees in the United States have \nbeen able to apply for and receive re-parole when their initial grants of parole expired. \n44.  Family Reunification Parole Programs: In 2007, DHS created the Cuban Family \nReunification Parole Program to allow certain approved beneficiaries of immigrant visa petitions, \nupon invitation by the federal government, to apply to be considered for parole into the United \nStates so that they would not have to wait abroad—sometimes for years—for a visa number to \nbecome available. See Cuban Family Reunification Parole Program, 72 Fed. Reg. 65588 (Nov. 21, \n2007). Similar programs were created for Haitian family members in 2014, family members of \nFilipino World War II veterans and their spouses in 2016, and family members from additional \ncountries in Central and South America in 2023. See, e.g. Implementation of Haitian Family \nReunification Parole Program, 79 Fed. Reg. 75581 (Dec. 18, 2014); Filipino World War II \nVeterans  Parole  Policy,  81  Fed.  Reg.  28097  (May  9,  2016);  Implementation  of  a  Family \nReunification Parole Process for Guatemalans, 88 Fed. Reg. 43581 (July 10, 2023). \nSummary Termination of Parole Processes \n45.  On January 20, 2025, President Donald Trump issued Executive Order 14165, \n“Securing Our Borders,” that, among other things, directed the Secretary of Homeland Security \n(the “Secretary”) to terminate all so-called “categorical parole program . . . including the program \nknown as the ‘Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans.’”  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 14 of 55\n \n46.  That same day, Acting Secretary Benjamine C. Huffman issued a memorandum \nentitled, “Exercising Appropriate Discretion Under Parole Authority,” to the heads of ICE, CBP, \nand USCIS. In that memorandum, Acting Secretary Huffman set out a narrow and legally incorrect \ninterpretation of the parole statute, directed that every action regarding parole henceforth use this \ninterpretation, and authorized pausing and terminating parole programs. \n47.  Also  on  January  20,  Acting  Commissioner  of  CBP  Pete  Flores  issued  a \nmemorandum restricting the CBP personnel authorized to grant parole and requiring that each \nparole granted by any CBP official be reported to him and the Chief of Staff, along with a \njustification for the grant. Acting Commissioner Flores’ memorandum expressly supersedes any \nprior conflicting guidance. \n48.  Further on that day, CBP terminated the ability of noncitizens to use the CBP One \nmobile application to schedule appointments to appear at select land ports of entry for inspection \nand consideration for parole and cancelled existing appointments. \n49.  Later that same week, Acting Director of USCIS Jennifer Higgins issued a directive \nprohibiting USCIS staff from making any further decisions on any request for, among other things, \nparole or re-parole made through the OAW, U4U, CHNV, or other named parole processes. \n50.  On March 21, DHS posted for public inspection a Federal Register Notice that \npurports to formally terminate the CHNV parole processes and to terminate en masse at the end of \na 30-day period all grants of parole issued to individuals pursuant to the CHNV parole processes. \nSee Termination of Parole Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, Mar. \n21,  2025,  https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-05128.pdf  (“CHNV  Termination \nNotice”). Through the Notice, DHS seeks to end all grants of parole and related employment \nauthorization documents and to make as many of these individuals as possible begin to accrue \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 15 of 55\n \nunlawful presence. The Notice asserts that the federal government has a “strong interest in \npromptly removing parolees when the basis for the underlying program no longer exists,” and \nnotes that “[e]xpedited removal is available only when an alien has not been continuously present \nin  the  United  States  for  at  least  the  two  years  preceding  the  date  of  the  inadmissibility \ndetermination.” Id. at 27 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(iii)(II); 8 C.F.R. § 235.5).” The Notice \nfurther observes that “[i]f DHS were to allow the CHNV parolee population to remain for the full \nduration of their two-year parole, DHS would be compelled to place a greater proportion of this \npopulation in section 240 removal proceedings to effectuate their removal.” Id. The Notice was \npublished in the Federal Register on March 25. \n51.  The termination of various humanitarian parole processes is being challenged in \nseparate litigation. See, e.g., Svitlana Doe v. Noem, No. 1:25-cv-10495 (D. Mass. filed Feb. 28, \n2025) (challenging, among other things, the termination of OAW, U4U, CHNV, and certain other \nparole processes). \nThe Statutory Expedited Removal Authority \n52.  Under our immigration laws and unless otherwise specified, removal proceedings \nconducted  in  immigration  court—with  the  right  to  appellate  review  before  the  Board  of \nImmigration Appeals and federal court review—are the “sole and exclusive procedure” for \ndetermining whether a person should be admitted to or removed from the country. 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a(a)(3). \n53.  One specified exception to full removal proceedings is the expedited removal \nprocess created by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act \nof 1996 (“IIRIRA”), which was first implemented through regulations adopted by the agency in \n1997, see Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens; Conduct of Removal Proceedings; asylum \nProcedures, 62 Fed. Reg. 10,312 (Mar. 6, 1997).  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 16 of 55\n \n54.  IIRIRA introduced a shift from the prior exclusion/deportation framework that \n“turned on whether [a noncitizen] had physically entered the United States” to “a new framework \nthat turned on whether [a noncitizen] had been lawfully admitted into the country by immigration \nauthorities.” Hillel R. Smith, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R45314, Expedited Removal of Aliens: Legal \nFramework (2019), https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R45314. \n55.  Under expedited removal, certain noncitizens determined by an immigration officer \nto be “inadmissible” because they engaged in fraud or misrepresentation to procure admission or \nother immigration benefits, 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C), or because they lack the requisite documents \nfor entry, Section 1187(a)(7), may be ordered removed by that officer “without further hearing or \nreview.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). There is no neutral arbiter in this proceeding—the officer \nwho initiates the removal order also adjudicates it. \n56.  By statute, the use of expedited removal is authorized for only two categories of \nnoncitizens. First, under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i), a noncitizen who “is arriving in the United \nStates” may be processed for expedited removal if they are found to be inadmissible on the grounds \ndescribed above. \n57.  Second, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) permits the Attorney General (now the \nSecretary of Homeland Security) to apply expedited removal to certain other noncitizens found \ninadmissible on the above grounds who have entered and remain in the United States but who \n“ha[ve] not been admitted or paroled into the United States.” For expedited removal to be used in \nthis way, the Secretary must designate certain noncitizens in the country to whom 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii) may be applied, although regardless of the Secretary’s designation, it may not \nbe applied to any noncitizen who can prove to the “satisfaction of an immigration officer” that \nthey were “admitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a port-of-entry” and \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 17 of 55\n \nhave  been  continuously  physically  present  in  the  country  for  two  years.  See  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II); 8 C.F.R. §§ 235.3(b)(1)(ii), (b)(6).  \n58.  Historically, expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) has been \napplied only to people in the process of seeking admission at a port of entry or for people \nencountered in the country a short time after entry and within 100 miles of a land border who had \n“not been admitted or paroled into the United States.” On January 21, 2025, Acting Secretary \nHuffman issued for public inspection a designation, effective immediately, expanding the scope \nof expedited removal to apply nationwide and to certain noncitizens who are unable to prove they \nhave been in the country continuously for two years. The designation was published in the Federal \nRegister three days later on January 24, 2025. See U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Designating \nAliens for Expedited Removal, 90 Fed. Reg. 8139 (Jan. 24, 2025). \n59.  This expansion of expedited removal is being challenged in separate litigation. See \nMake the Road New York v. Huffman, 25-cv-00190 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 22, 2025). \nApplication of Expedited Removal to Noncitizens Who Have Been Paroled \n60.  On January 23, 2025, Acting Secretary Huffman issued a memorandum entitled, \n“Guidance Regarding How to Exercise Enforcement Discretion,” to the leadership of ICE, CBP, \nand  USCIS.  The  memorandum  describes  the  Acting  Secretary’s  January  20  memorandum \nauthorizing the pausing or termination of various parole programs and the January 21 designation \nexpanding the scope of expedited removal—both of which are described above—and “provides \nguidance regarding how to exercise enforcement discretion in implementing these policies.” \n61.  Specifically, the January 23 Huffman Memorandum explains that “[t]o effectively \nimplement these two new policies,” agency personnel are “direct[ed]” to consider applying \nexpedited removal to “any alien DHS is aware of who is amenable to expedited removal but to \nwhom expedited removal has not been applied.” The memorandum notes that this may include \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 18 of 55\n \ntaking steps to “terminate any ongoing removal proceeding” in immigration court and/or “any \nactive parole status.” \n62.  For individuals DHS is aware of who do not meet the conditions above but have \n“been granted parole under a policy that may be paused, modified, or terminated immediately \nunder the January 20 memorandum,” the January 23 Huffman Memorandum directs that they be \nconsidered for placement in removal proceedings and that the continued appropriateness of their \nparole be reviewed. \n63.  On or about February 18, 2025, a directive was sent by ICE leadership to all \nEnforcement and Removal Operations personnel, citing a new Executive Order issued by President \nTrump on January 20, 2025 entitled “Securing Our Borders,” and directing such officers to \nconsider for expedited removal “paroled arriving aliens” who have not applied affirmatively for \nasylum with USCIS. The directive claims that “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to process \nsuch aliens for [expedited removal],” thereby exposing individuals paroled into the United States \nafter inspection at a port of entry to the indefinite threat of this fast-track removal process. \nAlthough this directive has not been officially released, a copy of the directive was published by \nReuters in connection with its reporting on the impact of the directive. See Ted Hesson and Kristina \nCooke, “Trump weighs revoking legal status of Ukrainians as US steps up deportations,” Reuters, \nMar.  6,  2025,  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-plans-revoke-legal-status-ukrainians-\nwho-fled-us-sources-say-2025-03-06/.  \n64.  The February 18 ICE Directive further states that the issuance to the individual of \nan expedited removal charging document has the effect of terminating that individual’s active \nparole status. \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 19 of 55\n \n65.  On March 25, DHS published in the Federal Register the CHNV Termination \nNotice, which discusses in multiple places when and under what authority the agency intends to \nprocess CHNV parolees for expedited removal. Like the February 18 ICE Directive, the March 25 \nCHNV Termination Notice cites the January 20, 2025 “Securing Our Borders” Executive Order \nand its direction to “terminate all categorical parole programs,” including the CHNV program, and \nannounces  the  termination  of  the  CHNV  parole  program.  The  Notice  further  states  that \n“[e]xpedited removal is available only when an alien has not been continuously present in the \nUnited States for at least the two years preceding the date of the inadmissibility determination.” \nCHNV Termination Notice at 27. Because “thousands of CHNV parolees . . . will become \nineligible for expedited removal upon the natural termination of their two-year parole,” id. at 29 \nn.77, and to “initiate expedited removal proceedings to the maximum extent possible for the \nappropriate CHNV population,” id. at 29, the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice seeks to \nterminate all existing grants of CHNV parole early, rather than allowing individuals the benefit of \nthe two-year period they have been granted, effective 30 days after the publication date.  \n66.  The March 25 CHNV Termination Notice also states that “DHS intends to prioritize \nfor removal” individuals who had not filed an immigration benefit request before the Notice’s \npublication date and are not the beneficiary of an immigration benefit request filed by another on \ntheir behalf.  \n67.  As directed by the January 23 Huffman Memorandum and the February 18 ICE \nDirective, some noncitizens who have been paroled into the country at ports of entry have been \nsubjected to expedited removal when attorneys for DHS filed motions to dismiss their pending \nremoval proceedings in order to initiate expedited removal proceedings.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 20 of 55\n \n68.  Starting around May 21, 2025, noncitizens and their attorneys nationwide began \nreporting this practice on a far broader scale. As noncitizens and their attorneys showed up to \nscheduled immigration court hearings, attorneys for DHS were filing motions, sometimes oral and \nsometimes written, to dismiss the noncitizens’ removal proceedings. Some motions provided \nlimited or no reasoning; others expressed DHS’s intent to process the noncitizen for expedited \nremoval. Noncitizens were not always given the opportunity to oppose the motion.  \n69.  If, as was often the case, an immigration judge granted the motion and dismissed \nthe case, noncitizens—and, in the case of noncitizens represented by counsel, their attorneys—\noften left these proceedings believing that the noncitizen was free of removal proceedings and \nwould be able to proceed with affirmative applications for relief outside of immigration court.  \n70.  As they were leaving the courtroom, ICE officers were waiting outside to arrest and \ndetain them, without a warrant of any kind, so they could be processed for expedited removal. In \nsome instances, ICE officers separated noncitizens from their family members, including young \nchildren, so they could apprehend and detain the noncitizens. \n71.  In some cases, noncitizens were detained after their immigration court hearings \neven though their removal proceedings had not been dismissed. They were told the proceedings \nwould be dismissed, and that they were going to be processed for expedited removal. \n72.  News reporting has indicated that this practice is widespread at immigration courts \naround the country. \n73.  Noncitizens who have been paroled into the United States, including Plaintiffs’ \nmembers and clients, are increasingly being subject to expedited removal.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 21 of 55\n \nHarm to Plaintiff Organizations and Their Members \n74.  The flaws and deficiencies in the expedited removal process, including when \ncompared to standard/normal removal proceedings under 8 USC § 1229a (“section 240 removal \nproceedings”), are widespread and well-documented. \n75.  While section 240 removal proceedings are formal adversarial civil proceedings \nconducted before a neutral adjudicator (an Immigration Judge), in expedited removal proceedings \nDHS officers both initiate and adjudicate the removal order. None of the officers involved in \nexpedited removal is required to serve as a neutral arbiter of fact. \n76.  In section 240 proceedings, noncitizens are afforded the opportunity to retain \ncounsel and request continuances to secure representation. In expedited removal, there is no \nstatutory or regulatory right to counsel prior to removal, and the compressed timeframes and \nremote locations in which these proceedings take place significantly diminish the ability of \nnoncitizens to locate and retain counsel. As the term “expedited” implies, such proceedings are \nconducted on a very compressed schedule and can result in deportation in hours or days. \n77.  Section 240 proceedings also grant noncitizens reasonable time to gather and \nsubmit  evidence,  including  documents  and  witness  testimony,  and  present  legal  motions. \nExpedited removal does not. If a noncitizen in expedited removal expresses a fear of return to their \nhome country, they should be referred for a “credible fear” screening interview with an asylum \nofficer (who is also an employee of DHS), but will be severely limited in the time they have to \ngather and present evidence during that interview and, as mentioned above, they have no right to \ncounsel during the interview. \n78.  While section 240 proceedings generate a formal record including transcripts and \nwritten decisions that are subject to appellate and judicial review, expedited removal results in \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 22 of 55\n \nsummary paperwork with no routine oversight or external review unless a credible fear claim is \naccepted.   \n79.  Clients who are not fluent in English have been forced to sign expedited removal \nforms in English without translation or interpretation. And noncitizens have very limited rights to \njudicial review of an expedited removal order. \n80.  During the recent courthouse arrests of noncitizens who have been paroled into the \ncountry, some noncitizens have been arrested without being told, and/or without understanding, \nthat they are being processed for expedited removal. They have not been given the opportunity to \ncontest the charges. \n81.  The  expedited  removal  process  also  does  not  provide  noncitizens  with  the \nopportunity to apply for any forms of immigration relief for which they are eligible, including \nthose that would lead to permanent lawful status in this country, such as asylum or a green card \nbased on marriage to a U.S. citizen. If noncitizens subjected to expedited removal are permitted to \nand do persuade an immigration official (in a brief interview often done telephonically, without \nlegal representation) that there is a sufficiently high likelihood that they will be tortured, killed, or \npersecuted if returned to their home country, those noncitizens are diverted from the expedited \nremoval system to the regular removal system. It is only then, in regular removal proceedings (or \nin no removal proceedings of any kind), that noncitizens can seek affirmative immigration relief.    \n82.  The  credible  fear  screenings,  moreover,  lack  basic  procedural  safeguards. \nEnforcement officers must refer an individual to a USCIS asylum officer to conduct the credible \nfear interview, but studies show that enforcement officers fail to do so consistently. As a result, \nasylum seekers have been deported through expedited removal without any opportunity to be \nscreened for fear, much less to apply for asylum.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 23 of 55\n \n83.  Even if noncitizens are referred for a credible fear interview, they are often detained \nin immigration detention facilities when they are interviewed, far from their attorneys, family \nmembers,  and  communities,  with  limited  access  to  resources  to  help  them  prepare  for  the \nscreening. They have limited access to counsel, and it is difficult for them to gather relevant \ndocuments, present evidence, or otherwise prepare. These inadequacies have led to the removal of \npeople back to countries where they face persecution and violence. \n84.  For noncitizens who are prima facie eligible for collateral relief (i.e., relief from \nremoval that can be granted not by an immigration court but by another entity like USCIS) such \nas applications for adjustment of status through a U.S. citizen immediate relative or other green \ncard  category,  Temporary  Protected  Status  (“TPS”),  or  Special  Immigrant  Juvenile  Status \n(“SIJS”), they have options in section 240 proceedings to request that the immigration judge \nmanage the case in a way that will allow them to pursue those applications. For example, an \nimmigration judge could grant a continuance, administratively close proceedings, or place the case \non the status docket to provide time for USCIS to adjudicate the collateral relief, which would \nobviate the need for the removal proceedings.1 The immigration judge could terminate the \nproceedings as well. These options are commonly used by immigration judges to manage their \ndockets and allow noncitizens to secure relief for which they are eligible under the law.  \n85.  In expedited removal proceedings, all of these options are foreclosed. The speed at \nwhich expedited removal proceedings move, and the lack of an independent arbiter separate from \n \n1 U.S. Dep’t of Justice, EOIR, Memorandum from Director James R.

Noncitizens who were paroled into the United States but arrested and detained for \nexpedited removal in the last few weeks have already reported that they will lose the opportunity \nto have applications for adjustment of status and SIJS adjudicated due to the government’s decision \nto detain them and process them for expedited removal. \n87.  Many of the noncitizens who were granted parole at ports of entry into the United \nStates and recently arrested to be processed for expedited removal either had asylum applications \nalready pending with the immigration court or were preparing to file them when they were \ndetained. They now face all of these new barriers. \n88.  Expedited removal orders have additional consequences for noncitizens beyond \nremoval itself, including a five-year ban on admission to the United States unless they are granted \na discretionary waiver, 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(9)(A)(i); 8 C.F.R. § 212.2. Noncitizens issued expedited \nremoval orders after having been found inadmissible based on misrepresentation are subject to a \nlifetime bar unless they are granted a discretionary exception or waiver. \n89.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit membership-based organizations whose members include \nindividuals who have been paroled into the United States through some of the humanitarian parole \nprocesses relevant to this case and are thus subject to the challenged policies implementing the \nexpedited removal statute. Defendants’ directives to apply expedited removal to parolees are \ncausing Plaintiffs’ members substantial injury.  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 25 of 55\n \n90.  Plaintiff CHIRLA’s mission is to advance the human and civil rights of immigrants \nand refugees and ensure immigrant communities are fully integrated into society with full rights \nand access to resources. \n91.  In furtherance of this mission, CHIRLA provides a range of services that reach tens \nof thousands of Californians each year. These services include education programs, legal services \nprograms, and an assistance hotline that fields on average 15,000 calls a year. CHIRLA educates \nits membership as well as the broader community through know-your-rights trainings, workshops, \nand social media and educational literature about a variety of social services and benefits, including \nimmigration law, financial literacy, workers’ rights, and civic engagement.  \n92.  CHIRLA serves individuals who were paroled into the country under humanitarian \nparole processes through all of its different programs. In particular, CHIRLA provides trauma-\ninformed wrap-around case management services to newly arrived migrant families who were \nparoled through CBP One and Afghan nationals who arrived through Operation Allies Welcome. \nThese include benefits navigation, employment services, housing search, cultural orientation, pro \nse legal services, and other services needed for newcomers to successfully integrate into their new \ncommunities. \n93.  CHIRLA members play an important role in deciding what CHIRLA’s priorities \nare and how CHIRLA serves the community. CHIRLA receives feedback from its members during \nan annual member meeting and other member convenings where CHIRLA staff meet with \nmembers to discuss priorities for CHIRLA’s work. \n94.  CHIRLA membership is voluntary, and it is open to anyone who believes in the \nimportance of social justice and supports an immigrant community, and who embodies diversity, \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 26 of 55\n \nequality and inclusion. By becoming a CHIRLA member, an individual agrees to take a stand for \nimmigrant rights. \n95.  To become a CHIRLA member, an individual must submit an online application \nfor membership, make an annual dues payment, and agree to the values and mission of CHIRLA. \nThe current membership fee for individuals is $25, which can be paid manually every year or by \nsetting up an annual recurring payment. There is also a family membership option, which is $60, \nand an enhanced individual membership (called a “community membership”) option, which is \n$100 and provides select additional benefits. The fee can be (and occasionally has been) waived \nfor individuals who experience financial hardship or are otherwise unable to pay. Once an \nindividual becomes a CHIRLA member, they will receive a membership card and access to \nCHIRLA legal services and educational resources, year-round events and membership calls, and \nother benefits.  \n96.  CHIRLA’s membership is diverse and includes U.S. citizens, non-U.S. citizens \nwith lawful status, and non-U.S. citizens without lawful status. Members include individuals who \nwere paroled into the country through the CBP One application, the Operation Allies Welcome \nparole process, and the CHNV parole process. CHIRLA has serviced hundreds of CBP One \nparolees, at least a dozen of whom have already become CHIRLA members.  \n97.  Members include both noncitizens who have been granted parole and have been \ncontinuously present in the United States for less than two years, as well as those who have been \nhere for two years or more. Some of these parolee members are in active removal proceedings \nalready, and some are not.  \n98.  Because of the services CHIRLA provides to its members, CHIRLA is acutely \naware of the harms that Defendants’ application of expedited removal to parolees is causing and \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 27 of 55\n \nwill continue to cause to its members. Parolee members of CHIRLA include individuals who are \ncurrently being processed for expedited removal and are actively and significantly harmed by \nDefendants’ directives.  \n99.  Specifically, CHIRLA has members who were granted parole through the CBP One \napplication and are currently in section 240 removal proceedings, who must appear in immigration \ncourt  for  regular  hearings.  Many  of  these  members  fear  that  they  will  be  apprehended  at \nimmigration court and summarily removed from the country because they have heard of the exact \nsame thing happening to others. CHIRLA also has members whose parole was prematurely \nterminated and who have been in the country for less than two years, including some who do not \nhave any pending applications for asylum or other immigration relief. CHIRLA members are well \naware of the recent significant increase in immigration enforcement at courthouses across the \ncountry and in and around Los Angeles. The stepped-up immigration enforcement underlines how \nexposed CHIRLA members are to the administration’s drive to terminate individual grants of \nparole and subject paroled individuals to expedited removal. \n100.  For example, E.I.R.M., a member of CHIRLA, arrived in the United States in 2023 \nafter securing a CBP One appointment, presenting at a port of entry on the appointed date, and \nbeing inspected and paroled through late 2025. At the same time as he was granted parole, he was \nissued a Notice to Appear that required him to appear at an immigration court hearing. While living \nand working in Arizona afterwards, he got engaged to a U.S. citizen, appeared for all his scheduled \nimmigration court hearings, and timely filed an asylum application with the immigration court. In \nMarch 2025, however, even though his parole was still valid, CBP arrested him when he drove \nthrough an interior CBP checkpoint and transferred him to ICE detention.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 28 of 55\n \n101.  E.I.R.M. has been in detention since then, during which time DHS moved to \ndismiss his removal proceedings so that they could process him for expedited removal. The \nimmigration judge granted the motion without providing time for E.I.R.M. to respond.  \n102.  E.I.R.M. now faces severe barriers to having his asylum claim adjudicated. He was \nnot provided access to counsel during his CFI, and he has received neither a transcript of his \ninterview, nor the immigration judge review he requested of his negative CFI determination. As \nhe will become eligible to apply for adjustment of status once he and his fiancée are married, the \ndismissal of his removal proceedings and placement of his case in expedited removal have \neffectively foreclosed his opportunity to pursue that form of relief from removal. E.I.R.M. has \nbeen in detention, and thus separated from his fiancée and family, for several months, which has \ncaused him mental distress as well. He fears swift deportation back to Mexico, where he would \nface harm. Both he and his brother received death threats from a Mexican cartel that the US \ngovernment has designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. \n103.  The parolee members of CHIRLA also include many individuals who face an \nimminent risk of expedited removal given Defendants’ application of their directives to increase \nthe use of expedited removal against parolees, and who would be deeply and severely harmed if \nthey were subject to expedited removal. For example, CHIRLA John Doe 1 is an Ecuadorian man \nwho was paroled into the United States through CBP One and concurrently issued an NTA during \nthe latter half of 2024, after he fled Ecuador out of fear for his life. After a cartel began extorting \nhim for money, threatening to kill him if he didn’t make regular payments and if he tried to leave \ntown, he felt he had no other option but to flee the country. Unable to make payments, and \nunwilling to give into pressure to join the cartel, CHIRLA Doe 1 left his home, fearing for his life. \nGiven Defendants’ use of expedited removal against individuals like him—who made a CBP One \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 29 of 55\n \nappointment and were subsequently inspected and paroled into the country at a port of entry, and \nwere concurrently placed in section 240 removal proceedings—CHIRLA John Doe 1 is likely to \nbe similarly targeted for expedited removal in the near future. Expedited removal back to Ecuador \nwould put CHIRLA John Doe 1 back at risk of being murdered by the cartel. \n104.  Another CHIRLA member is a Guatemalan woman whose husband was the target \nof death threats back in Guatemala. A man who was the head of a local criminal network and who \nwas rumored to have murdered at least one other person in the community made verbal threats to \ntheir family, including to their son, and stalked them, hanging around their house at all hours. \nBefore the death threats and stalking, he and members of his network had also harassed the \nCHIRLA member and her family when they went outside, impeding their ability to move freely. \nThe CHIRLA member and her family tried to file reports with the police to obtain help but, as the \nman was a former police officer, the police did not get involved. For their safety, she and her \nfamily left their home and arrived in the United States in the summer of 2023 after being paroled \ninto the country following a CBP One appointment. She was issued an NTA at the same time she \nwas granted parole. Given Defendants’ use of expedited removal against individuals like her who \nentered and were granted parole through a CBP One appointment and are in section 240 removal \nproceedings, this CHIRLA member and her family are likely to be similarly targeted for expedited \nremoval in the near future. The CHIRLA member has applied for asylum, but the expedited \nremoval process will pose more significant barriers to having that claim heard. If she and her \nfamily were subject to expedited removal, they would be rapidly sent back to the same severe risk \nof harm, including of death, from which they fled. \n105.  Another CHIRLA member is an Afghan man who was paroled into the United \nStates through CBP One during the summer of 2024 and issued an NTA at the same time. He fled \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 30 of 55\n \nAfghanistan  because  he  is  a  member  of  a  minority  community  that  the  Taliban  and  ISIS \nsystematically target for violence, killings, and bombings. He has survived attacks in the past, but \nthe fall of Kabul in August 2021 escalated the threats against him and his community. He is also \nan  activist,  so  he  faces  an  even  higher  risk  of  persecution,  torture,  and  even  execution  in \nAfghanistan. Given Defendants’ use of expedited removal against individuals like him who \nentered and were granted parole through a CBP One appointment and are in section 240 removal \nproceedings, this CHIRLA member is likely to be similarly targeted for expedited removal in the \nnear future. If he is put into expedited removal proceedings and deported to Afghanistan, he would \nbe in immediate danger of kidnapping, torture, and death at the hands of the Taliban. He would \nface severe restrictions on his freedom to exercise his religion, freedom of expression, and freedom \nof movement. \n106.  CHIRLA members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers and detention \nby ICE are common. ICE actively detains noncitizens all over California, including in and near \nLos Angeles. \n107.  Parolee clients and members have expressed fears to CHIRLA around their parole \nstatus being revoked and then being subject to expedited removal. Beyond being fearful, CBP One \nparolees also express a sense of betrayal as they followed an established process laid out by the \nU.S. government, with many of them waiting months and in some cases over a year in Mexico—\noften in dangerous and difficult settings—for their appointments to appear at a land port of entry \nfor inspection and consideration for parole. OAW Afghan parolees have expressed an even more \nheightened sense of disappointment as many of them risked their lives to support the U.S. military, \nand the government is now turning its back on them. \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 31 of 55\n \n108.  Expedited removal of parolees like CHIRLA’s members would be particularly \nharmful because of the rapid, summary nature of the process. It makes it more difficult for \nmembers and their families to have a plan in place; it causes more devastating, sudden family \nseparation, which has a severe impact on any children involved; and the community around the \nmembers suffer as well. Additionally, the rapid deportation process would deprive some CHIRLA \nmembers of the opportunity to submit applications for immigration protections to which they are \nentitled, as described above. \n109.  In its educational materials and know-your-rights trainings, CHIRLA has been \nteaching members about the risk of detention and deportation, including through expedited \nremoval, and what they can do to prepare themselves and their families for the possibility.   \n110.  Plaintiff  UndocuBlack’s  mission  is  to  foster  community,  facilitate  access  to \nresources,  and  contribute  to  transforming  the  realities  of  its  members—who  are  Black \nimmigrants—so they can thrive and live their fullest lives.   \n111.  UndocuBlack’s community-centered approach aspires to empower members to \nidentify their needs and help shape the trajectory of UndocuBlack’s work. UndocuBlack engages \nand supports their members and advocates for policies that protect members and Black immigrants \nat  large  through  different  areas  of  work  including  community  engagement  and  organizing, \ncommunity wellness, narrative and storytelling, and policy and advocacy.  \n112.  UndocuBlack has members across the country with chapters in New York, Los \nAngeles,  and  Washington,  D.C.  UndocuBlack  serves  thousands  of  immigrants  through  its \norganizational chapters with a national network across approximately thirty states.  \n113.  UndocuBlack’s membership is over 1,000 active members. To become an active \nUndocuBlack member, an individual must (1) identify as Black, (2) be an immigrant, and is asked \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 32 of 55\n \nto (3) apply by submitting a form to indicate their interest in joining the membership. There are no \nmembership dues required. UndocuBlack also considers individuals in the larger UndocuBlack \ncommunity—a  diverse,  inclusive,  and  expansive  network—who  have  been  involved  with \nUndocuBlack programming or who have reached out to the organization for services to be \nmembers of UndocuBlack. \n114.  UndocuBlack has long served and supported the Haitian community in particular. \nPrior to the Trump administration’s termination of humanitarian parole programs, UndocuBlack \nhelped many Haitian members in the United States determine if they were eligible to sponsor \nfamily members for CHNV parole based on their income. UndocuBlack also assisted Haitian \nmembers and their families with school enrollment, getting connected to English Language \nLearner  programs,  applying  for  work  authorizations,  and  completing  applications  for  other \nimmigration benefits like TPS.   \n115.  UndocuBlack’s members include at least 300 Haitian parole beneficiaries who were \ngranted parole through either CHNV parole or CBP One. The Trump administration’s application \nof expedited removal to parolees directly harms these members. Under the administration’s recent \npolicies, UndocuBlack’s members who are Haitian CHNV and CBP One parole beneficiaries face \nan imminent risk of being processed for expedited removal, which would cause them severe harm. \n116.   Members who were paroled into the country through the Haitian CHNV parole \nprogram have now had their parole terminated early, and they face the impending threat of \nexpedited removal given that in the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice, the federal government \nexpressed a strong interest in initiating expedited removal proceedings “to the maximum extent \npossible” for CHNV parole beneficiaries. \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 33 of 55\n \n117.  Some UndocuBlack members who are Haitian CHNV parolees did not come to the \nUnited States in time to apply for TPS, and even those who now have TPS recognize that the \nTrump administration is working to terminate those protections early (i.e., by August 3, 2025). \nMany have pending applications for other kinds of immigration relief, including asylum and \nadjustment of status, but some do not or are still preparing to file such applications. Given the \nMarch 25 CHNV Termination Notice and the government’s increased use of expedited removal \nagainst paroled individuals, these members are at imminent risk of being processed for expedited \nremoval and facing significant barriers to presenting the claims for which they are eligible. \n118.  Additionally, although the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice indicated that \nindividuals without pending immigration benefits will be prioritized for expedited removal, \nUndocuBlack’s members are well aware of news reports of the Trump administration canceling \nother immigrants’ visas and green card petitions and fear that their own petitions could likewise \nby canceled or otherwise rendered invalid. They are also well aware of news reports of the Trump \nadministration’s directives instructing DHS agencies to consider revoking individuals’ grants of \nparole in order to subject them to expedited removal. Many CBP One parole beneficiaries have \nalready had their parole revoked, and all CHNV parole beneficiaries will likely have their parole \nswiftly terminated soon. \n119.  UndocuBlack’s Haitian CHNV parolees also often have family members with \ndifferent immigration statuses. UndocuBlack expects that many affected members, if they are put \nin expedited removal, will experience abrupt family separation and/or will lose one or more \nhousehold incomes. UndocuBlack members could also be deported to Haiti where they do not have \nfamily or resources, and where they may be at risk of violence. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 34 of 55\n \n120.  UndocuBlack members who were granted parole through a CBP One appointment \nare also likely to be processed for expedited removal, given the recent rise in arrests at courthouses \nof noncitizens after their removal proceedings for that purpose. This practice of courthouse arrests \nposes particular danger to UndocuBlack members who are CBP One parolees, because many of \nthem were placed in removal proceedings at the time of their parole and must appear regularly in \nimmigration court. \n121.  UndocuBlack members who may be eligible for asylum or Convention Against \nTorture protections in the United States still fear that they could be deported through expedited \nremoval, given the flaws in the credible fear screening process. The screenings depend on case \nreferrals by enforcement personnel to asylum officers, and noncitizens are given little opportunity \nto gather relevant documents, present evidence, or consult counsel. Due to these and other \ninadequacies, the screenings can result, and have resulted in, the removal of people to dangerous \ncircumstances abroad.   \n122.  One UndocuBlack member, UBN Jane Doe 1, is a Haitian woman who was \nsponsored to come to the United States through the Haitian CHNV parole process. She applied for \nand was granted TPS, but now, due to the administration’s efforts to terminate Haitian TPS \nprematurely, that status will likely expire in August, and she could be subject to expedited removal. \nUBN Jane Doe 1’s son, who is back in Haiti, is ill, and being able to work in the U.S. through \nCHNV has been the only way UBN Jane Doe 1 has been able to provide for him. The termination \nof her CHNV parole and the anticipated early termination of her TPS, together with the possibility \nof being removed expeditiously without a meaningful opportunity to request any possible form of \nrelief, have caused significant harm to UBN Jane Doe 1, who has relied upon CHNV parole to \nprovide for herself and her ailing child. Moreover, the government’s betrayal and stripping of time \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 35 of 55\n \nthat was given to her—which would be exacerbated by efforts to quickly remove her without \nprocess—will cause deep financial and psychological harm to her. Given Defendants’ stated \nintention to initiate expedited removal proceedings to the maximum extent possible for CHNV \nbeneficiaries like her, UBN Jane Doe 1 is likely to be targeted for expedited removal in the near \nfuture. \n123.  Another UndocuBlack member, UBN Jane Doe 2, is a 45-year-old mother who fled \nHaiti and was paroled into the U.S. with her young son through CBP One in March 2024. She is \nin removal proceedings, and as she struggles to navigate the complex asylum process without legal \nrepresentation, she lives in constant fear for both her life and her child’s. Her greatest terror is that \nstepping outside for any reason could mean never returning to her son. Through free legal \nresources, she has learned that she must always be prepared to show documentation of at least two \nyears of presence in the U.S., but the harsh reality is that she simply does not have that. The weight \nof this requirement, coupled with the uncertainty of her status, leaves her paralyzed with fear—\nafraid to attend her own hearings, afraid to send her son to school, and even afraid to stay in her \nown home. Any knock at the door or passing shadow, even from the mail carrier, fills her with \nterror. She lives in a constant state of anxiety, fearing that at any minute she will be processed for \nexpedited removal, forced to try and quickly defend her asylum claim alone and without the \nopportunity to see a judge, without the ability to pay for an attorney, and while battling language \nbarriers. Given Defendants’ use of expedited removal against individuals like her who entered and \nwere granted parole through a CBP One appointment and are in section 240 removal proceedings, \nthis UndocuBlack member is likely to be similarly targeted for expedited removal in the near \nfuture. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 36 of 55\n \n124.  UndocuBlack members live in areas where encounters with ICE officers and \ndetention by ICE are common. ICE actively detains noncitizens all over New York, where the \nlargest concentration of UndocuBlack members reside. In the last several months, this activity has \nincreased significantly, including for noncitizens granted parole. \n125.  Since the administration’s expansion of expedited removal to apply nationwide and \nto certain noncitizens who cannot prove they have been here for two years and the various \ndirectives  that  expose  parolees  to  expedited  removal, UndocuBlack has  received  countless \ninquiries from its members and the UndocuBlack community at large, including from those with \nparole, regarding what these policies mean and how they will be used to arrest, detain, and \nexpeditiously remove parolees. In response to members’ questions and requests for additional \ninformation, UndocuBlack created a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) resource to share with \nmembers and the broader community. UndocuBlack has also conducted member calls that have \nincluded Know Your Rights (KYR) trainings; such trainings have covered the impact that the \nexpansion of expedited removal will have on parolees and safeguards that parolees should take to \nprotect themselves and their families.  \n126.  UndocuBlack and its members see the expedited removal policies at issue in this \ncase as another anti-Black, anti-Haitian attack in a long line of such discrimination and violence \nby the Trump administration. \n127.  As  an  organization  with  some  undocumented  members  who  are  also  Black, \nUndocuBlack’s  members  will  be  disproportionately  affected  by  the  Trump  administration’s \nexpedited removal expansion. Due to intersectional bias around race and criminality, Black people \nin the United States experience a higher rate of interaction with law enforcement than people of \nother races. This racial bias and profiling coupled with a person’s immigration status and possible \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 37 of 55\n \nlanguage barrier will mean that Haitian parolees will be some of the most adversely affected by \nthis expansion. \n128.  Plaintiff CASA’s mission is to create a more just society by building power and \nimproving the quality of life in working-class Black, Latino/a/e, Afro-descendent, Indigenous, and \nimmigrant communities. From its beginnings in a church basement, CASA has envisioned a future \nwith diverse and thriving communities living free from discrimination and fear, working together \nwith mutual respect to achieve human rights for all. \n129.  In furtherance of this mission, CASA offers a wide variety of social, health, job \ntraining, employment, and legal services to immigrant communities, with a particular focus in \nMaryland, Washington, D.C., Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Georgia. CASA also offers a more \nlimited suite of services remotely to members across the United States. Those individuals who do \nnot live in an area with a local CASA organizing committee are offered the opportunity to join a \nnational organizing committee, whose members are entitled to vote on CASA’s organizational \npriorities and are integrated into its member-led system of internal democratic governance. CASA \nalso conducts campaigns to inform members of immigrant communities of their rights and assists \nindividuals in applying for a variety of government benefits. In addition, CASA provides its \nmembers with free remote legal assistance, including free legal consultations and referrals on \nimmigration issues. Capacity permitting, CASA provides legal representation to members in \nremoval defense cases and on affirmative immigration applications to USCIS.   \n130.  A CASA member is a person who shares CASA’s values, envisions a future where \nwe can achieve full human rights for all, and is convinced that, when united and organized, we can \ncreate a more just society by building power in our working-class and immigrant communities. \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 38 of 55\n \nCASA members play an important role in deciding what campaigns CASA works on and how \nCASA serves the community. \n131.  CASA membership is voluntary. To become a member, an individual must apply, \npay dues, and subscribe to the principles of CASA. CASA members also must self-identify as \nmembers of an immigrant or working-class community. Currently, the annual fee for CASA \nmembership is $35. Alternatively, individuals may pay a recurring membership fee of $5 per \nmonth. The membership fee can be waived when appropriate. Members are also offered the \nopportunity, for an additional $5, to obtain a CASA ID. This is a physical, picture identification \ncard that contains basic information about the member. For many of CASA’s immigrant members, \nthis card may be the only type of picture identification they have, other than documents from their \nhome country. In certain jurisdictions, CASA IDs are recognized for the purposes of engaging \nwith certain government agencies, including the police. \n132.  CASA has members who have been paroled into the United States, including \nmembers who have received parole after presenting at a land port of entry with a CBP One \nappointment and through the CHNV parole processes.  \n133.  More than 33,000 CASA members entered the United States after the CBP One app \nfirst launched in October 2020, and a significant portion of those members were likely granted \nparole through CBP One. We are aware of CASA members who have had their grants of CBP One \nparole prematurely terminated, putting them at risk of being subjected to expedited removal.   \n134.  Some CASA members have already been directly harmed by being processed for \nexpedited removal under Defendants’ directives and recent actions increasing the use of expedited \nremoval against paroled individuals.  \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 39 of 55\n \n135.  For example, E.M.P. is a member of CASA and Venezuelan national who was paroled into the \ncountry through a CBP One appointment in December 2023 and issued an NTA. He filed an \napplication for asylum with the court in late 2024. When E.M.P. appeared in immigration court on \nMay 21, 2025 for his second master calendar hearing, the attorney representing DHS moved to \ndismiss his case and the Immigration Judge granted dismissal, advising E.M.P. to apply for asylum \naffirmatively with USCIS if he wanted to continue his asylum claim. It was not clear to E.M.P. \nthat dismissal meant that he was going to be put in expedited removal. However, as he was leaving \nthe courtroom, ICE officers followed him and arrested him. He has been detained since, which has \nbeen detrimental to his mental and physical health, and he is awaiting a credible fear interview. In \nexpedited removal, he now faces significant barriers to presenting and fighting his asylum case, \nincluding that he is detained far from his attorney and loved ones, and the risk of swift deportation \nback to a country to which he fears returning. \n136.  Similarly, D.L.C., a 20-year-old national of Venezuela and CASA member, was \ngranted  parole  into  the  United  States  in  May  2024  through  a  CBP  One  appointment  and \nsimultaneously issued an NTA. Once in the U.S., he lived with his mother, also a CASA member, \nand started attending public school to learn English. He also filed an application for asylum with \nthe immigration court detailing his fear of removal to Venezuela. In October 2024, D.L.C. attended \nhis first master calendar hearing, during which the Immigration Judge scheduled a second hearing \nfor May 2025. Prior to that second hearing, D.L.C. began the process of seeking Special Immigrant \nJuvenile Status (“SIJS”), a pathway to a green card for children under 21 years of age who have \nbeen “abused, neglected, or abandoned” by one or more parents. D.L.C. is prima facie eligible for \nSIJS relief. On May 21, 2025, when D.L.C. and his mother attended his second master calendar \nhearing in New York, the attorney for DHS moved to dismiss D.L.C.’s proceedings. Neither \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 40 of 55\n \nD.L.C. nor his mother realized that dismissal would lead to D.L.C.’s arrest, and both believed that \nit would allow him to pursue his asylum and SIJS applications more easily. However, after the \nimmigration judge granted dismissal and D.L.C. and his mother left the courtroom, ICE officers \nfollowed them into the elevator, ordered them up against the wall, and arrested and detained D.L.C. \nIt was only when D.L.C. was scheduled for a CFI that he and his counsel realized he was being \nprocessed for expedited removal. Being subject to expedited removal put D.L.C. at great risk of \nlosing his ability to pursue SIJS and created significant barriers to his ability to pursue his asylum \nclaim. He is also deprived of consistent access to counsel and separated from his family, school, \nand other support. D.L.C. also suffers from serious, chronic health issues for which he is unable to \nget treatment while in detention. \n137.  CASA  has  multiple  members  who  could  be  placed  in  expedited  removal \nproceedings under the Trump administration’s current policies at any point because they fit one or \nmore of the various profiles the administration has prioritized for expedited removal. CASA has \nmultiple members whose parole has been prematurely terminated and who have been in the United \nStates for less than two years, including some do not have any pending applications for alternate \nimmigration relief. CASA also has multiple members who were granted parole through the CBP \nOne application and are currently in section 240 removal proceedings, who must appear in \nimmigration court for regular hearings and who run the risk of having their proceedings dismissed \nand subsequently being placed in expedited removal. The significant ramp-up in immigration \nenforcement in recent weeks, including but not limited to courthouse arrests and raids in Los \nAngeles that have resulted in swift and summary deportations, only underlines the vulnerability of \nCASA members to the harms of the administration’s policies terminating individual grants of \nparole and exposing paroled individuals to expedited removal. \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 41 of 55\n \n138.  CASA member J.N.M., for example, is a Haitian national whose sister sponsored \nhim to come to the United States with his two children on CHNV parole in July 2024. In Haiti, \nJ.N.M. was assaulted at gun point, and gangs threatened to kidnap his children, which forced him \nto stop taking them to school. Since being paroled into the United States with his family, J.N.M. \nhas for the first time in many years been able to live in peace, with his children attending school \nand no longer fearing for their physical safety. However, now that his CHNV parole is subject to \nimminent termination, he is at risk of being subjected to expedited removal because he fits the \nprofile outlined in the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice. After consulting with a CASA \nattorney, J.N.M. was advised to apply for asylum, but he has not been able to find an attorney to \nassist him with the application and CASA has not been able to provide him with representation \ndue to resource constraints. To his knowledge, he does not have a case in immigration court, but \nhe has a pending sibling petition his sister filed for him approximately seven years ago. He is \nterrified  of  being  subjected  to  expedited  removal  without  the  chance  to  pursue  an  asylum \napplication and while the sibling petition remains unadjudicated. All of the gang members who \nthreatened his children know who he is and know that he left, so if he returns to Haiti he fears it \nwill be a death sentence for him and his family.    \n139.  L.Z.P. is a CASA member originally from Honduras who currently resides in \nMaryland. A single mother, she and her three children—ages 18, 13, and 6—entered the United \nStates on humanitarian parole after attending a CBP One appointment at the southern border in \nJuly 2024. L.Z.P.’s youngest two children are in school in the U.S., which is an opportunity they \ndid not have while living in Honduras, and she works at a fruit factory, helping to pack fruit for \ndistribution, to ensure that her family have their daily necessities. Over the last month, LZP \nreceived notice that both her parole status and work authorization have been terminated, despite \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 42 of 55\n \nthe fact that her parole was not supposed to expire until June 2, 2026 and her work authorization \nwas valid through July 1, 2026. These terminations have made her even more afraid that she could \nbe returned to Honduras, because she faced domestic violence by her ex-partner there, including \ndeath threats against her and the children. She is very afraid of being separated from her children, \nbecause they could not support themselves without her. She has a pending asylum claim and \nintends to apply for work authorization based on her pending asylum application as soon as she is \neligible, but recent reporting about individuals who, like her, were paroled into the country being \ndetained after immigration court and placed into expedited removal makes her afraid to go to her \nnext scheduled hearing. This places her in a terrible situation where she is afraid to pursue her \nlegitimate asylum claim, since even going to court could mean that she would be summarily \ndetained and removed from the country without the process she is relying upon. Yet she knows \nthat in order to have any hope for the future she must fight her case and plans to continue complying \nwith all of her legal obligations, including presenting for immigration court. \n140.  N.D.G. and Y.P.C. are a married couple originally from Venezuela who currently \nlive in Maryland. Both are CASA members. They, along with their four children—ages 16, 13, 8, \nand 5—were granted humanitarian parole through CBP One in July 2024. They were also issued \nNTAs, so they are in section 240 removal proceedings. N.D.G. works as a DoorDash driver to \nsupport their family, and Y.P.C. devotes her time to taking care of their children. Their 8-year-old \nson suffers from a disability called psychomotor delay that slows his learning process. He still \nrequires diapers, has difficulty walking, and cannot write. He requires constant support. While he \ndoes attend school, Y.P.C. often has to go to the school to help the teachers with his care. N.D.G. \nwas a politically active small business owner back in Venezuela, and he was targeted and attacked \nby the government for supporting its opposition. If he and Y.P.C. were subject to rapid, expedited \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 43 of 55\n \ndeportation back to Venezuela, they fear their family’s safety would be at risk, and they would not \nbe able to pursue their pending asylum claims. Given Defendants’ use of expedited removal against \nindividuals like them who entered and were granted parole through a CBP One appointment and \nare in section 240 removal proceedings, N.D.G. and Y. P.C. are likely to be similarly targeted for \nexpedited removal in the near future. \n141.  CASA is acutely aware of the harms that Defendants’ application of expedited \nremoval to parolees is actively causing and will continue to cause. CASA has heard from its \nmembers that there is widespread confusion and fear from the administration’s decisions to end \nparole processes and expand expedited removal. There has also been a chilling effect among \nmembers, with members unsure about whether it is safe to share their information with government \nagencies, including by applying for further immigration benefits for which they qualify. Given all \nof the recent policy reversals, they have significant and legitimate fear that their information will \nnow be weaponized against them.  \n142.  CASA members who may be eligible for asylum or Convention Against Torture \nprotections in the United States still fear that they could be deported through expedited removal, \ngiven the ever-shifting nature of policy changes within this administration. They do not know if \nthey will be able to have their case properly heard by an immigration judge, or if anyone will care \nabout their legitimate fear of return.  \n143.  In response, CASA has devoted significant resources to deportation defense and \npreparing its membership for potential immigration enforcement actions, including developing \nnew Know Your Rights resources and devoting additional resources to immigration counseling \nand rapid response to immigration enforcement. Stripping legal protections from hundreds of \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 44 of 55\n \nthousands of people, and subjecting them to rapid deportation via expedited removal, has a deep \nnegative impact on CASA’s membership. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n(as to the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive,  \nand the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice) \n \n144.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n145.  An immigration officer may process a noncitizen for expedited removal upon \ndetermining that such noncitizen “is arriving in the United States or is described in clause (iii)” \nand  is  inadmissible  under  8  U.S.C.  §§  1182(a)(6)(C)  or  1182(a)(7).  See  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i). \n146.  Subclause (I) of clause (iii) referenced above provides that the Secretary may apply \nexpedited  removal  to  “any  or  all  aliens  described  in  subclause  (II)  as  designated  by  the \n[Secretary].” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(I). \n147.  Subclause (II) referenced above includes a description of noncitizens who may be \ndesignated  by  the  Secretary  to  be  amenable  to  expedited  removal  and  specifies  that  such \nnoncitizens must not “ha[ve] been admitted or paroled into the United States.” 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). A noncitizen who “ha[s] been admitted or paroled following inspection by \nan immigration officer at a designated port-of-entry” is excluded from expedited removal under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i). 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii); see also 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) (requiring \nthat noncitizen be given a “reasonable opportunity” to establish to an immigration officer “that he \nor she was admitted or paroled into the United States following inspection at a port-of-entry” \nbefore being subjected to expedited removal). \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 45 of 55\n \n148.  The February 18 ICE Directive violates the INA and is “not in accordance with \nlaw” and “in excess of statutory . . . authority” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), to the \nextent that it authorizes the use of expedited removal for noncitizens who were inspected and \ngranted parole at a port of entry and are currently present in the United States subsequent to that \nparole. Such individuals have already arrived in the United States and have lawfully applied for \nand secured employment, enrolled their children in school, and taken steps to settle their lives here \nfor the duration of their parole or prospective immigration pathways, and are therefore no longer \nin the act of “arriving.” Because such noncitizens are not “arriving in the United States,” they \ncannot be subjected to expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i).  \n149.  The January 23 Huffman Memorandum and the March 25 CHNV Termination \nNotice violate the INA and are “not in accordance with law” and “in excess of statutory . . . \nauthority” under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), to the extent that they authorize the use of \nso-called expanded expedited removal for CHNV and other parole beneficiaries who have not \n“been physically present in the United States continuously for the 2-year period immediately prior \nto the date of the determination of inadmissibility.” 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II). See CHNV \nTermination Notice (noting that “CHNV parolees . . . will become ineligible for expedited removal \nupon the natural expiration of their two-year parole.”). Such individuals “ha[ve] been . . . paroled \ninto the United States,” which makes them ineligible for expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II), regardless of whether they have been physically present in the United States \nfor less than two years. \n150.  Each of these policies must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, and/or otherwise \nvacated. \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 46 of 55\n \n151.  Each of these policies constitutes a new and unique “written policy directive, \nwritten policy guideline, or written procedure issued by or under the authority of the [Secretary of \nHomeland Security] to implement [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b), the expedited removal statute].” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(e)(3)(A)(ii).  \n152.  Because this claim was brought within 60 days of the issuance of the January 23 \nHuffman Memorandum, the earliest issued of these policies, this action is timely instituted under \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)(B). \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) –  \narbitrary and capricious) \n(as to the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive,  \nand the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice) \n \n153.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n154.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is arbitrary and capricious. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n155.  The agency’s various articulations of its authority to expose individuals inspected \nand granted parole at ports of entry to expedited removal are unexplained and entirely inconsistent \nwith each other. In the January 23 Huffman Memorandum and the March 25 CHNV Termination \nNotice, the Department contemplates using expedited removal against parolees pursuant to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii). The March 25 CHNV Termination Notice in particular clearly \narticulates the Department’s view that under the expedited removal statute, CHNV parolees may \nbe removed only under this provision, which is why the Department decided to terminate CHNV \nbeneficiaries’ paroles precipitously in order to maximize the number of people who may be \nexpeditiously removed by minimizing the number who have been continuously present in the \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 47 of 55\n \ncountry for two years. The February 18 ICE Directive, however, appears to make all individuals \nwho were granted parole at ports of entry and are now present in the United States eligible for \nexpedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(i) as individuals who are “arriving.” The \ndirective additionally is explicit that “[t]here is no time limit on the ability to process [such parole \nbeneficiaries] for expedited removal.” \n156.  Neither the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, nor the February 18 ICE Directive, \nnor the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice contains any reasoned explanation for why parole \nbeneficiaries may be processed for expedited removal, and any explanation that exists in the \nJanuary 23 Huffman Memorandum and March 25 CHNV Termination Notice is inconsistent with \nany explanation that exists in the February 18 ICE Directive. The arbitrariness and capriciousness \nof each agency policy is further evidenced by the failure of each such policy to consider the \nagency’s own contrary conclusions regarding the legal authority for the agency to adopt the policy \nas contemplated. None of these documents acknowledges, much less provides an explanation for, \nthe inconsistency and the change in policy from the January 23 Huffman Memorandum to the \nFebruary 18 ICE Directive to the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice. Indeed, the inconsistent \nagency interpretations are both incorrect as a matter of law. \n157.  Moreover, none of the agency policies consider the impact of their decision to apply \nexpedited  removal  to  some  population  of  parolees  on  paroled individuals themselves, their \nfamilies,  their  employers,  their  communities,  and  any  financial  supporters,  as  well  as  any \nreasonable alternatives. \n158.  Each of these policies must therefore be held unlawful, set aside, and/or otherwise \nvacated.  \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 48 of 55\n \nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to  \nthe United States Constitution) \n(as to the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive,  \nand the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice) \n \n159.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n160.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that “[n]o person shall \n. . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” \n161.  Plaintiffs who are at risk of being subjected to expedited removal under the January \n23  Huffman  Memorandum,  the  February  18  ICE  Directive,  and/or  the  March  25  CHNV \nTermination Notice are entitled under the Due Process Clause to notice, an opportunity to be heard, \nand to have the law correctly applied to their cases, including to a meaningful process before they \ncan be removed from the country. \n162.  The January 23 Huffman Memorandum, the February 18 ICE Directive, and the \nMarch  25  CHNV  Termination  Notice  must  therefore  be  enjoined  as  violative  of  the  Fifth \nAmendment’s guarantee of due process. \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) –  \nAccardi Doctrine) \n(as to the January 23 Huffman Memorandum and the March 25 CHNV Termination \nNotice) \n \n163.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n164.  Title  8  U.S.C.  §  1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II)  states  that  the  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity may apply expedited removal to an individual “who has not been admitted or paroled into \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 49 of 55\n \nthe United States” and cannot show that he or she “has been physically present in the United States \ncontinuously” for two years. \n165.  Under  DHS  regulations,  when  the  federal  government  determines  that  the \nexpedited removal provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1) apply to an individual described in an \nexpedited removal designation made by the Secretary of Homeland Security under 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii),2 that individual “will be given a reasonable opportunity to establish to the \nsatisfaction of the examining immigration officer that he or she was admitted or paroled into the \nUnited States following inspection at a port-of-entry.” 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) (emphasis added). \nAn individual who cannot show “that he or she was lawfully admitted or paroled will be ordered \nremoved  pursuant  to  [section  235(b)(1)  of  the  INA,  the  expedited  removal  authority].”  Id. \n(emphasis added); see also 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii) (stating that expedited removal under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) applies only to certain noncitizens in the United States “without \nhaving been admitted or paroled,” while section 240 removal proceedings apply to a noncitizen \nhas been present in the country for at least  two years notwithstanding the fact that the noncitizen \n“was not inspected and admitted or paroled.” (emphasis added)). \n166.  The January 23 Huffman Memorandum instructs the component DHS agencies to \nconsider whether to apply expedited removal to paroled individuals, including taking “steps to \nterminate any ongoing removal proceeding and/or any active parole status.” The March 25 CHNV \n \n2 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(6) contains what appears to be an erroneous cross-reference that has been in \nplace since the interim final rule was published in 1997. Namely, although the text of the regulation \nsays it applies to “any or all aliens described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section,” it appears to \nbe meant to be referring to paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. The reference to (b)(2)(ii) appeared \nin the original Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens, 62 \nFed. Reg. 444-01, 480 (proposed Jan. 3, 1997)), and remained in place when the Interim Final \nRule was published, even though the Interim Final Rule switched the order of § 235.3(b)(1) and \n(b)(2). Inspection and Expedited Removal of Aliens, 62 Fed. Reg. 10312, 10314 (interim rule \npromulgated Mar. 6, 1997). \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 50 of 55\n \nNotice further states that CHNV parolees “will become ineligible for expedited removal upon the \nnatural expiration of their two-year parole,” and as a result states that all grants of CHNV parole \nwill terminate on April 24, 2025, to serve DHS’s “strong interest in preserving the ability to initiate \nexpedited removal proceedings to the maximum extent possible for the appropriate CHNV \npopulation.”  These  policies  are  based  on  Defendants’  interpretation  of  8  U.S.C.  § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II) that a noncitizen who has been paroled into the country becomes a person \nwho has not been paroled into the country once their parole status terminates or expires. See Doe \nv. Noem, No. 1:25-cv-10495 IT, 2025 WL 1099602, at *17 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025) (summarizing \nDefendants’ position); see also Defs.’s Mot. Dismiss, Dkt. No. 20, at 39-40 (arguing that only an \nindividual who “retains parole status” is exempt from expedited removal, while an individual \nwhose “parole is terminated or expired” may be subject to expedited removal). \n167.  Defendants’  actions  are  contrary  to  the  express  terms  of  the  statute  and  the \nimplementing regulation at 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(6), which expressly contemplate that \nan individual who can demonstrate to an immigration officer’s satisfaction “that he or she was \nadmitted or paroled into the United States” at a point in the past may not “be ordered removed \npursuant to [8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)].” \n168.  Defendants’ interpretation of the statute and relevant regulations, as set forth above, \nviolate agency procedures, including those found at 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b)(1)(ii) and (b)(6).  \n169.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, should therefore be set aside under the \nprinciple articulated in United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260 (1954). \n170.  Defendants’ actions, as set forth above, fail to comply with the issuing agencies’ \nregulations and are therefore arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 51 of 55\n \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A); \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2); 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e)(3)) \n(as to 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 definition of “arriving alien” only) \n \n171.  All the foregoing allegations are repeated and incorporated as though fully set forth \nherein. \n172.  The  INA  specifies  in  precise  terms  only  two  circumstances  under  which  a \nnoncitizen may be subjected to expedited removal: if the noncitizen “is arriving in the United \nStates” and is inadmissible either because they engaged in fraud to procure admission or other \nimmigration benefits, or because they lack the requisite documents for entry, see 8 U.S.C. § \n1225(b)(1)(A)(i); or if the noncitizen “has not been admitted or paroled into the United States” and \nhas not been in the United States continuously for at least two years before the date the noncitizen \nis determined to be inadmissible, see 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A)(iii)(II).  \n173.  The expedited removal statute “thus allows for expedited removal for a non-citizen \n‘arriving in the United States’ (i.e., arriving at the border or a port of entry).” Doe v. Noem, No. \n1:25-cv-10495 IT, 2025 WL 1099602, at *16 (D. Mass. Apr. 14, 2025). It also allows for expedited \nremoval “for a non-citizen who entered the United States without authorization, except that a non-\ncitizen who entered the United States without authorization, that is an individual who ‘has not been \nparoled or admitted into the United States,’ may not be subject to the expedited removal period if \nthat individual has been present in the United States for two years.” Id. But “[t]he statute does not \nsubject persons who were authorized to enter the United States to expedited removal, regardless \nof how long they have been in the United States.” Id.  \n174.  Title 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 defines an “arriving alien” as:  \nan applicant for admission coming or attempting to come into the \nUnited States at a port-of-entry, or an alien seeking transit through \nthe  United  States  at  a  port-of-entry,  or  an  alien  interdicted  in \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 52 of 55\n \ninternational or United States waters and brought into the United \nStates by any means, whether or not to a designated port-of-entry, \nand regardless of the means of transport. An arriving alien remains \nan arriving alien even if paroled pursuant to section 212(d)(5) of the \nAct, and even after any such parole is terminated or revoked.  \n175.  Title 8 C.F.R. § 235.3(b), the regulation that implements the expedited removal \nstatute, refers to and incorporates 8 C.F.R. § 1.2’s definition of “arriving alien” when outlining the \ntwo classes of noncitizens to whom “[t]he expedited removal provisions shall apply.” \n176.  The breadth of 8 C.F.R. § 1.2’s definition of “arriving alien” means that, via 8 \nC.F.R. § 235.3, more classes of individuals are subjected to expedited removal than permitted by \nthe expedited removal statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A). Title 8 C.F.R. § 1.2’s definition of \n“arriving alien” is therefore “not in accordance with law” and “in excess of statutory . . . authority.” \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  \n177.  The statutory limits on the Secretary’s expedited removal authority are clear: the \nSecretary may “utilize expedited removal only with regard to those arriving at the border or a port \nof entry, or those who entered the country unlawfully and have not been present in the country \nlong enough to warrant consideration of any interests their residence may have created.” Doe, 2025 \nWL 1099602, at *17.  \n178.  The overbroad definition of “arriving alien” in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2, when Defendants \napply it through 8 C.F.R. § 235.3, means that any paroled individual may be subjected to expedited \nremoval at any time, regardless of the fact that the individual was lawfully paroled into the United \nStates,  and  regardless  of  how  long  the  individual  has  been  continuously  in  the  country, \nimpermissibly expanding the narrow classes of noncitizens that Congress determined should be \nsubjected to expedited removal and deprived of the normal due process protections available in \nordinary removal proceedings under 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 53 of 55\n \n179.  To the extent the unlawfully overbroad definition of “arriving alien” in 8 C.F.R. § \n1.2 permits the application of expedited removal to individuals who have been paroled into the \nUnited States at a port of entry, regardless of the fact that the individual was lawfully paroled into \nthe United States, and regardless of how long such an individual has been continuously present in \nthe United States, the definition of “arriving alien” in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 must be held unlawful, set \naside, and/or otherwise vacated.  \n180.  To the extent the overbroad definition of “arriving alien” in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 reflects \nthe agency’s considered interpretation of the INA, that interpretation is not entitled to deference \nfrom courts reviewing agency action under the APA. Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. \n369, 392 (2024) (“Section 706 [of the APA] makes clear that agency interpretations of statutes—\nlike agency interpretations of the Constitution—are not entitled to deference. Under the APA, it \nthus ‘remains the responsibility of the court to decide whether the law means what the agency \nsays.’” (quoting Perez v. Mortgage Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 109 (2015)).). \n181.  The regulatory definition of “arriving alien” in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 is not subject to 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(a)(2), which makes certain matters pertaining to 8 U.S.C. § 1225 not subject to \njudicial review. As a result, it does not need to fit within the jurisdiction preservation provisions \nof 8 U.S.C. § 1252(e), including the filing deadline provision in (e)(3) for suits challenging the \nimplementation of the expedited removal statute.  \n182.  This claim is timely because it is brought within six years of when Plaintiffs’ right \nof action accrued. See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(a); Corner Post, Inc. v. Bd. of Governors of Fed. Reserve \nSys., 603 U.S. 799, 808, 825 (2024) (“An APA claim does not accrue for purposes of § 2401(a)’s \n6-year statute of limitations until the plaintiff is injured by final agency action.”).  \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 54 of 55\n \n183.  In the alternative and to the extent this claim is subject to the judicial review \nprovisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2) and (e)(3), this claim is timely even if it is subject to the 60-\nday  deadline  in  8  U.S.C.  §  1252(e)(3)(B),  based  on  equitable  tolling.  Boechler,  P.C.  v. \nCommissioner,  596  U.S.  199,  209  (2022)  (“[N]onjurisdictional  limitations  periods  are \npresumptively subject to equitable tolling.”). \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \n1.  Declare that noncitizens who have previously been granted parole at ports of entry \nare not amenable to expedited removal under 8 U.S.C. § 1225(b)(1)(A) and that the January 23 \nHuffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Termination Notice are \nunconstitutional and contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA; \n2.  Declare that the definition of “arriving aliens” in 8 C.F.R. § 1.2 conflicts with the \nINA and is ultra vires. \n3.  Preliminarily enjoin and stay the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 \nICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Termination Notice pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(a) and 5 U.S.C. § 705 during the pendency of this suit; \n4.  Permanently enjoin and vacate the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February \n18 ICE Directive, the March 25 CHNV Termination Notice, and 8 C.F.R. § 1.2’s definition of \n“arriving alien” at final judgment; \n5.  Enjoin Defendants from applying expedited removal to noncitizens who have \npreviously been granted parole at a port of entry; \n6.  Enter an order vacating the order of expedited removal of any member of a Plaintiff \norganization wrongfully subjected to expedited removal as a consequence of Defendants’ action(s) \nchallenged here;  \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 21     Filed 06/11/25     Page 55 of 55\n \n7.  Enter an order requiring Defendants to facilitate the return to the United States of \nany member of a Plaintiff organization wrongfully removed pursuant to an order of expedited \nremoval issued in accordance with Defendants’ action(s) challenged here; \n8.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to \nJustice Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and \n9.  Grant such relief as the Court deems just, equitable, and appropriate. \nDated: June 11, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Esther H. Sung         \nEsther H. Sung (CA00132) \nKaren C.

Case No.: 1:25-cv-0872 \n   \nKRISTI NOEM, in her official capacity as Secretary of \n \nHomeland Security, et al., \n \n       Defendants. \n \nMOTION FOR A STAY OF AGENCY ACTION UNDER 5 U.S.C. § 705 \n \nPlaintiffs Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (“CHIRLA”), CASA, Inc. (“CASA”), \nand UndocuBlack Network (“UndocuBlack”) respectfully move under 5 U.S.C. § 705 of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) to stay the effective date of agency actions. Plaintiffs seek \nan  order  immediately  postponing  and  staying  the  effective  dates  of  implementation  and  \nenforcement of the January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 \nParole Termination Notice for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) insofar \nas they subject individuals who have previously been granted parole at ports of entry to expedited \nremoval. Defendants oppose this motion. \nPlaintiffs file this motion to stop the irreparable harm that their members, their members’ \nfamilies and communities, and the public are suffering due to the agency actions. In recent weeks, \nDefendants have aggressively targeted for expedited removal individuals who entered the country \nlawfully after being inspected and paroled at official ports of entry, including by moving to dismiss \ntheir ongoing removal proceedings in immigration courts across the country. Paroled individuals \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00872-JMC     Document 22     Filed 06/11/25     Page 2 of 4\n \nshowing up to routine court appearances are being unexpectedly arrested and detained once their \nproceedings have been dismissed—and occasionally when proceedings have not been dismissed—\nand are then placed in a rapid, summary deportation process (or threatened with such placement) \ndespite the fact that they have been dutifully appearing for court hearings and, in many cases, \ntimely filed applications for asylum or other immigration relief. Plaintiffs’ members already have \nbeen subjected to serious harm by Defendants’ actions, and other members of the Plaintiff \norganizations who were paroled into the country at ports of entry are at imminent risk of being \nsimilarly subjected to expedited removal in violation of the law. Defendants’ actions, pursuant to \nthe January 23 Huffman Memorandum, February 18 ICE Directive, and March 25 CHNV Parole \nTermination Notice, are unlawful and place Plaintiffs’ members at risk of deportation without due \nprocess, loss of immigration relief for which they are eligible, and separation from their families \nand lives in the United States. \nThis Motion is based upon this Motion; the accompanying Memorandum of Law; the \nsupporting declarations and evidence filed concurrently herewith; the pleadings and filings in this \ncase; any additional matter of which the Court may take judicial notice; and such further evidence \nor argument as may be presented before, at, or after a hearing on this Motion. \nA proposed order is attached hereto. \nREQUEST FOR ORAL ARGUMENT \nPlaintiffs respectfully request an oral argument pursuant to Local Rule 7(f) on this Motion. \n \nDated: June 11, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \n  /s/ Esther H.
