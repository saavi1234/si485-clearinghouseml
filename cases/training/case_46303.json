Important countervailing interests can, in given instances, overwhelm the usual presumption and defeat access.\" (quoting Siedle v. Putnam Inv., Inc., 147 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1998)). In its assessment of a request to seal, a court is required to \"carefully balance the presumptive public right of access against the competing interests that are at stake in a particular case.\" Id. The exhibits were generated in child protective proceedings and are confidential by statute. The interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the records generated in child protection proceedings supports the seal of the exhibits in this case. By MAGISTRATE JUDGE JOHN C. NIVISON.

    "summary": "<p>This is a class action lawsuit about the administration of psychotropic drugs in Maine foster care.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On January 6, 2021, the plaintiffs, four foster children in the custody of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), filed suit through their next friend in U.S. District Court for the District of Maine against the Commissioner of the Maine DHHS and the Director of the Maine Office of Child and Family Services. The complaint set forth that Maine&rsquo;s Department of Health and Human Services and Office of Child and Family Services permit the administration of psychotropic drugs to foster children, without sufficient oversight mechanisms. There are over 2,000 children in foster care in Maine, and according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, up to 80% of children in foster care have significant mental health needs, making this population particularly vulnerable to overmedication. Plaintiffs alleged that there are strict recommended metabolic monitoring schedules for psychotropic medication and requirements set forth in federal law, but that such schedules are rarely followed. Plaintiffs alleged that Maine&rsquo;s oversight failures included the failure to maintain readily accessible, up-to-date medical records for children in foster care; failure to maintain a minimally adequate, informed consent process; and failure to maintain an appropriate monitoring system to flag and review &ldquo;outlier&rdquo; prescriptions of psychotropic medications. Plaintiffs, foster care children who had been prescribed and administered inappropriate dosages of psychotropic medication while in state custody, reported that as a result of their medication, they experienced harmful side-effects, including but not limited to suicidal idealization, hallucinations, personality changes, and brain fog. Plaintiffs filed the class action on behalf of a putative class of Maine foster children who similarly were or would be administered psychotropic medication.</p>\r\n<p>In their complaint, plaintiffs set forth the following claims under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983: (1) Defendants violated plaintiffs&rsquo; substantive due rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, which requires states to protect children in its foster care custody from unreasonable risk of harm, by acting in a way that departed from acceptable professional judgment, (2) Defendants violated plaintiffs&rsquo; procedural due rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, interfering with defendants&rsquo; liberty interests without due process of law by subjecting plaintiffs to unnecessary medication without sufficient procedures or a process for informed consent, and (3) Defendants violated plaintiffs&rsquo; rights under the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect;621, 670, which create statutory rights to individualized written case plans to assure safe and proper care and to have health records reviewed and timely supplied to foster care providers. Plaintiffs sued for injunctive and declaratory relief to enjoin defendants from continuing the use of current policies, and instead implement and maintain comprehensive electronic healthcare records for all children in foster care and timely provide medical histories to foster caretakers; develop new consent, monitoring, and training policies; and to develop and implement a system of secondary review to flag outlier prescriptions.</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2021, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, wherein they provided up-to-date information on the medical history of the named plaintiffs but otherwise re-alleged their claims.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 19, 2021, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. While conceding that the plaintiffs&rsquo; allegations warrant prompt attention from the Maine DHHS, the defendants argued that DHSS has been making substantial progress to rectify these issues and that a federal court is not the proper lens to address those concerns. Defendants argued, in substance, that (1) under the abstention doctrine in Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), the court should abstain from exercising jurisdiction where potential relief would interfere with ongoing state judicial proceedings, which implicate state interests and provide opportunity to hear federal and constitutional claims, (2) Defendants also claimed that as a minor may only sue in federal courts via a &ldquo;next friend&rdquo; or &ldquo;guardian ad litem&rdquo; and the plaintiffs sued through designated &ldquo;next friends&rdquo; instead of appointed guardians at litem, that the plaintiffs lacked standing, (3) lastly, defendants argued that the plaintiffs&rsquo; claims do not implicate the Fourteenth Amendment as they failed to allege &ldquo;conscience-shocking conduct&rdquo; or other deprivations of violation of plaintiffs&rsquo; constitutional rights, and that there is no private cause of action under the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act which the plaintiffs based some of their claims upon.</p>\r\n<p>On October 4, 2021, Judge Nancy Torrensen issued an order granting and denying in part defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. The court reviewed the legal posture of each plaintiff and reviewed defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss. First, while the court found no issue with most of the named plaintiffs, the court held that with respect to one plaintiff, the complaint never set forth how the named plaintiff was harmed by actions or omissions taken by the defendants. The court allowed leave to amend the complaint sua sponte, but noted that if the plaintiffs failed to allege how the defendants played any role in that named plaintiff being incorrectly administered psychotropic medication, that named plaintiffs&rsquo; claims must drop out.</p>\r\n<p>Second, the court then addressed each aspect of the defendants&rsquo; arguments in their motion to dismiss. For the defendants&rsquo; argument for abstention under Younger v Harris, the court held that there are three categories in which Younger abstention applies &ndash; state criminal prosecutions, state proceedings akin to a criminal prosecution, and civil proceedings with orders uniquely furthering state courts&rsquo; ability to perform their judicial functions &ndash; none of which, the court held, defendants successfully explained would apply here. For the defendants&rsquo; standing argument, the court held that the next friends in this action were appropriate: The next friends here are genuinely motivated to help plaintiffs seek relief, are familiar with the situation, understand their role, are able and willing to litigate on plaintiffs&rsquo; behalf, and are familiar with the realities that foster children face &ndash; all the criteria needed to be next friends in litigation. Lastly, with respect to defendants&rsquo; due process arguments, the court held as follows: For the procedural due process claim, the plaintiffs adequately alleged violation of procedural due process rights, which is a mixed question of law and fact. However, with respect to defendants&rsquo; motion on the plaintiffs&rsquo; Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act claim, the court noted that while the Federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act could allow for private actions to be brought, one part of the Act which the plaintiffs sued under (&sect;671) did not: This section of the Act required that the case review system operate to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the U.S. DHSS, and is not focused directly on the benefit to foster children, which is a necessary predicate for private action. As such, the court dismissed the plaintiffs&rsquo; claim grounded on &sect;671 of the Act.</p>\r\n<p>On October 18, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. In line with the court&rsquo;s action on the defendants&rsquo; motion to dismiss, plaintiffs provided greater specificity on the medical treatment of the named plaintiff, and specifically laid out how defendants failed to provide adequate oversight and medical information while the plaintiff was in foster care.</p>\r\n<p>The parties then proceeded into discovery. In 2022, while engaging in discovery discussions, the parties also began settlement negotiations. The parties filed joint status reports, providing updates on the status of those settlement talks. On March 1, 2024, after the conclusion of these negotiations, the parties filed a joint motion for approval of their settlement agreement, requesting court approval.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement, which would resolve the pending claims with the court to retain jurisdiction to enforce the settlement terms, required the following:</p>\r\n<p>1. &nbsp;Establishment of procedures for the timely preparation of a Portable Health Record for each child in DHHS custody, which would be timely updated and would move with the child from placement to placement;</p>\r\n<p>2. &nbsp;Creation of a process for informed consent by designated adults and children over fourteen years old, for all classes of psychotropic medication;</p>\r\n<p>3. &nbsp;Creation of a psychiatric Clinical Review Team to conduct prospective and retrospective reviews of psychotropic medication recommendations and prescriptions.</p>\r\n<p>The settlement agreement set forth Performance Criteria and a third-party Implementation Reviewer to ensure timely and effective implementation, and also provided for notice to all class members in the following form to make them aware of the proposed settlement. Under the terms of the agreement, the defendants agreed to compensate plaintiffs $675,000 for attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs in this litigation.</p>\r\n<p>On July 3, 2024, the court provided preliminary approval of the class action settlement. Finding that the proposed settlement agreement was reasonable and likely fell within the range of possible final approval, the court extended preliminary approval, pending a Fairness Hearing. The court also appointed class counsel to represent the class members in this settlement.</p>\r\n<p>A final Fairness Hearing was held on November 4, 2024. The parties then filed a joint motion for final approval with the court.</p>\r\n<p>On November 27, 2024, the court issued its order, providing final approval. Finding no issues raised in the Fairness Hearing, the court approved the class action settlement, class certification per the settlement terms, and attorneys&rsquo; fees. The court also, in line with the terms of the settlement agreement, dismissed all claims in this action without prejudice.</p>",

The State of Maine, through its duly appointed state officials, has an affirmative \nduty under the United States Constitution to keep safe over 2,000 children in foster care placed \ninto its custody and care due to substantiated abuse or neglect.  Oftentimes, these children are \ngiven  powerful  psychotropic  medications  while  in  state  custody  to  address  mental  health \nconditions or simply to control their behavior.  However, there is a profound “gap” between what \nMaine “believe[s] to be important to keep children safe when using [] powerful [psychotropic] \ndrugs,  and what  is  actually happening.”   According to the  Assistant  Inspector General  for \nEvaluations and Inspections at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, what is \nactually happening is that “children in the [Maine] foster care system [] aren’t getting the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 2 of 71    PageID #: 2\n \nsafeguards they need to protect them from inappropriate care” with respect to the administration \nof psychotropic medications.    \n2.  Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs that impact emotions and behavior, \nsuch as anti-anxiety agents, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and antipsychotics. \nThese  medications  are  particularly  potent  to  children.    Alas,  any  child  administered  these \nmedications faces a heightened risk of life-threatening physical and emotional harms at a greater \nfrequency and at a greater severity.  These harms include seizures, psychosis, suicidal thoughts, \nself-harm, weight gain, lack of mental clarity, excessive fatigue, aggression, mental health crises, \ninvoluntary movements, diabetes, cardiovascular events, organ damage, and even sudden death. \n3.  Foster children are particularly vulnerable to these serious harms associated with \npsychotropic medications.  The  U.S.  Department  of Health and  Human Services  Office of \nInspector General (“OIG”) informed the public that “[u]p to 80 percent of children in foster care \nenter State custody with significant mental health needs.  Unlike children from intact families, \nchildren in foster care often do not have a consistent interested party to coordinate treatment \nplanning  or  to  provide  continuous  oversight  of  their  mental  health  treatment.    Further, \nresponsibility for children in foster care is shared among multiple people—foster parents, birth \nparents, and caseworkers—which creates risk of miscommunication, conflict, and lack of follow-\nup.  Children in foster care may also experience multiple changes in placement and in physicians, \nwhich can cause health information about these children to be incomplete and spread across many \nsources.  Therefore, children in foster care may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing practices \n(e.g., too many medications, incorrect dosage, incorrect duration, incorrect indications for use, or \ninappropriate treatment).” \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 3 of 71    PageID #: 3\n \n4.  For about a decade, Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) \nand Office of Child and Family Services (“OCFS”) have openly acknowledged the serious risks \nassociated with psychotropic medication administered to foster children as well as their duty to \nmaintain robust protections to protect Maine foster children against these dangers.  Unfortunately, \nhowever, Maine has never created an adequate system to protect foster children in its care.  Instead, \nDHHS and OCFS acknowledged their own system’s failures.  The same systemic failures have \npersisted for years as the State has continued to receive scrutiny.  For instance, in late 2018, Maine \nwas criticized by the federal Department of Health and Human Services OIG for having one of the \nworst  systems  in  the nation with  respect  to  its oversight  and management of psychotropic \nmedications for foster children. \n5.  Maine DHHS and OCFS continue to permit hundreds of foster children to be \nadministered  one  or  more  dangerous  psychotropic  drugs  without  ensuring  the  provision  of \nsufficient oversight mechanisms critical for their safety, knowingly exposing vulnerable children \nin their care to life-threatening risks.  Maine’s most pronounced and harmful oversight failures \ninclude the following: \na.  Inadequate Medical Records:  Maine fails to maintain readily accessible, \ncomprehensive, and up-to-date medical records for children in its custody.  It \nfurther fails to provide these records to all foster caregivers promptly upon the \nplacement of a child in their care or to all prescribing physicians for purposes \nof treatment.  Without maintaining and promptly providing such critical records \nthat detail the child’s physical and mental health history, including current and \nprior medications and observed side effects, DHHS and OCFS fail to facilitate \nfully informed, safe, and well-coordinated treatment for its foster children.   \n \nb.  Inadequate  Informed  Consent:  Maine  fails  to  maintain  and  enforce  a \nminimally adequate informed consent process, whereby a clearly designated \nadult  consents  to  the  administration  of  any  recommended  psychotropic \nmedication to a child only after receiving complete information, both prior to \nand throughout the administration of the medications, assessing the intended \nbenefits and potential risks associated with the drugs. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 4 of 71    PageID #: 4\n \nc.  Inadequate Secondary Review:  Maine fails to maintain and operate an \nappropriate system to sufficiently ensure that all especially dangerous and \noutlier  prescriptions  of  psychotropic  medications  to  children—such  as \npotentially life-threatening combinations of psychotropic drugs administered \nconcomitantly to a child—are immediately flagged for purposes of conducting \na secondary review through a qualified child psychiatrist to assure safety.   \n \n6.  As a result of these failures, hundreds of preschoolers through teens in Maine’s \nfoster care system remain at an unreasonable risk of serious harm with each passing day.  They \ntake heavy cocktails of psychotropic medications that can, and do, lead to serious, life-altering \nphysical and psychological harms—without proper structures in place by Defendants to identify \nand guard against these harms.  \n7.  This litigation seeks solely injunctive relief to remedy these systemic failures and \nto protect these vulnerable Maine foster children. \n8.  Named Plaintiffs Bryan C., Henry B., Trent W., Grayson M., Kendall P., and \nNeville H. bring this class action on behalf of a putative class of Maine foster children who are or \nwill be administered psychotropic medications in the State’s custody and, hence, are subjected to \na substantial risk of serious harm through the State’s oversight failures.  The Named Plaintiffs \nname Jeanne M. Lambrew, Ph.D., Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human \nServices, and Todd A. Landry, Ed.D., Director of the Maine Office of Child and Family Services, \nas Defendants in their official capacities only.   \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n9.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress violations of the \nUnited States Constitution and federal statutory law.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 5 of 71    PageID #: 5\n \n10.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  District  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District.  Venue \nis proper in this Division because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to these \nclaims occurred in Kennebec and Cumberland counties.  Named Plaintiffs Bryan C. and Neville \nH. currently reside in  Cumberland County.  Named Plaintiff Henry B. currently resides in \nKennebec County. \nIII. PARTIES \nA.  The Named Plaintiffs   \ni.  Bryan C. \n11.  Bryan C.1 is a 7-year-old boy.  He was drug-exposed at birth and subjected to \nneglect,  emotional  abuse,  and  physical  abuse  throughout  his  early  childhood.   Bryan  C.’s \nbiological mother struggled with drug addiction.  At age 5, he was involved in a serious car \naccident while his mother was driving under the influence.  He was hospitalized for his injuries, \nremoved from his biological home in Hiram, Maine, and placed into foster care custody.   \n12.  In the brief two years since being placed into foster care, Bryan C. has cycled \nthrough multiple settings across the state.  Bryan C. has moved between a kinship placement with \nhis maternal aunt, crisis placements, and psychiatric hospitals and treatment facilities throughout \nthe state, such as in Aroostook County, over five hours away from his biological family.  In July \n2020, he was placed in a residential treatment facility in Bridgton, Maine, and he remains there \ntoday. \n13.  While in state custody, Bryan C.’s psychotropic medications have included at least \nthe following: (1) Risperidone (an antipsychotic); (2) Clonidine (an alpha agonist); (3) Vyvanse (a \n                                                           \n1 All Named Plaintiff first names and last initials listed in this Complaint consist of pseudonyms to protect the identities \nof the Named Plaintiff children.  A corresponding motion to use pseudonyms is filed herewith. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 6 of 71    PageID #: 6\n \nstimulant); (4) Aripiprazole (Abilify, another antipsychotic); (5) Methylphenidate (Ritalin, a \nstimulant); (6) Adderall (another stimulant), and (7) Sertraline (Zoloft, an antidepressant).  He has \nalso frequently been administered Melatonin. \n14.  Bryan  C.  has  been  repeatedly  subjected  to  polypharmacy  of  psychotropic \nmedications throughout his time in state custody.   \n15.  He  has  been  administered  at  least  four  different  psychotropic  medications \nconcurrently while in state care.  For example, he is currently being administered a cocktail of \nVyvanse, Risperidone, Clonidine, and Zoloft in addition to Melatonin.   \n16.  Bryan C. has been reportedly subjected to inappropriate dosages of medications for \na child of his age and size.  When Bryan C. was hospitalized following a crisis, a doctor reviewing \nhis medical history found the administration of Vyvanse to Bryan C. to be entirely inappropriate \nin terms of the medication itself and the dosage level.  Upon information and belief, no red flag or \nsecondary review process has been triggered by this prescribing practice.     \n17.  Bryan  C.  has  experienced  a  litany  of  harms  and  adverse  effects  from  these \npsychotropic medications.   \n18.  In  August  2019  at  age  6,  Bryan  C.’s  medication  regime  was  changed  to \nRisperidone, Vyvanse, and Melatonin.  In late August 2019, he experienced increased aggression \nand irritability.  Bryan C. also experienced his first of many suicidal ideations and threats.  He \nthreatened to kill himself with a toy gun.  He was subsequently hospitalized in Bangor, Maine.   \n19.  Bryan C. began to inflict self-harm.  For instance, at school, he would repeatedly \nbang his head against the wall.  By early 2020, a typical day at school for him consisted of violent \nbehavior toward himself and others, as well as multiple suicidal statements.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 7 of 71    PageID #: 7\n \n20.  Bryan C.’s caregiver reported as early as June 2019 that his ADHD medications \nmade him withdrawn, anxious, and irritable.   \n21.  He experienced weight gain.  At age 6, he reportedly gained approximately 25 \npounds while taking Risperidone without any discernable benefit.  OCFS has expressed awareness \nof this weight gain.  \n22.  At one point, Bryan C. developed a tic in his eye.     \n23.  Bryan  C.  experienced  excessive  fatigue,  excessive  sleeping,  and  other  sleep \ndisturbances. While in his one-on-one learning environment in early 2020, he would constantly \nfall asleep in class, often laying sound asleep on a couch in his classroom.  This fatigue, in addition \nto his frequent hospital and crisis stabilization unit stays, has significantly disrupted his learning \nand development.  In spring 2020, at age 7, he reportedly could not write his own name.  \n24.  Bryan C. has reportedly experienced excessive thirst and excessive urination while \ntaking psychotropic medications, which can be suggestive of diabetes.  His A1C levels, a critical \nmarker for diabetes, were once belatedly tested months ago but not followed up on.  Upon recent \nrequest for the results of this test, the child’s OCFS caseworker, case manager, and residential \ntreatment placement were all unable to produce the relevant records.  OCFS instead directed the \nplacement to reach out to the local hospital directly to try to obtain the records themselves.  As of \nthis writing, his A1C results continue to remain unknown to Bryan C.’s guardian ad litem and, \nupon information and belief, his OCFS caseworker. \n25.  While receiving psychotropic medications, Bryan C. has experienced an inability \nto focus and a lack of mental clarity.  In the child’s own words, his “brain doesn’t work.  [He] \ncan’t feel [his] brain.”   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 8 of 71    PageID #: 8\n \n26.  More  psychotropic  medication  became  the  answer  to  problems  caused  by \npsychotropic medications.  Bryan C. was often prescribed new psychotropic medications to treat \nside effects of other psychotropic medications.  For instance, after he was first prescribed Vyvanse \nin approximately April 2019 at age 6, he experienced irritability and aggression.  A few months \nlater, in early August, his aunt informed his OCFS caseworker and Next Friend that Risperidone \nwas added on top of his existing Vyvanse due to his aggressive behaviors.  He has more recently \nbeen administered Zoloft “to try [to] settle him down at night,” and he has regularly been \nprescribed Melatonin to help him sleep. \n27.  When he was 6 years old, a hospital monitored him for 5 days without medications, \nswitched  his  medications  to  Abilify  and  Adderall,  and  expressly  directed  that  his  prior \nprescriptions of Vyvanse, Melatonin, and Risperidone all be discontinued.  But just weeks later, \nhis prior prescriber reinstated his use of Vyvanse, and his use of Risperidone was also reinstated \nshortly thereafter.  Bryan C. again fared poorly on the old medication regime, and again ended up \nin a crisis stabilization unit. \n28.  At the time of and since these medications’ prescription, Defendants have not \ncommunicated or implemented an effective informed consent process through which an objective \ndecision-maker can consent to medication for Bryan C. after receiving full information about a \npotential  medication’s  risks,  benefits,  and  alternative  treatments,  nor  has  there  been  any \ncommunicated process by which one can object to medications.   \n29.  Upon information and belief, Bryan C.’s caseworkers are not typically present at or \ninvolved in appointments with prescribers when potential psychotropic medications are discussed \nor prescribed.  At times, upon information and belief, they were notified of medication changes \nafter the fact, rather than playing a necessary role in the medication discussion to ensure that the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 9 of 71    PageID #: 9\n \nchild is safe and that meaningful informed consent is fully obtained.  For instance, when his \nresidential treatment facility added a fourth psychotropic medication, Zoloft, to Bryan C.’s cocktail \nof psychotropic medications, his OCFS caseworker was notified of the medication change only \nafter Bryan C. had begun the medication. \n30.  Defendants have not promptly provided Bryan C., his caregivers, his advocates, or \nhis prescribing physicians a comprehensive, up-to-date medical record that would contain his \nmedical information and psychotropic medications, such as adverse effects and instructions for \ncurrent medications, or warnings about prior unsuccessful medications.  \n31.  For instance, no medical passport listing his medical history and psychotropic \nmedications has moved with the child from placement to placement. \n32.  Bryan C.’s health record is poorly maintained by Defendants such that Bryan C.’s \ncaretakers, clinicians, advocates, and even Defendants’ caseworkers do not have ready access to \nhis prior and current medication regimes at any given time.  This has harmed Bryan C. on more \nthan one occasion. \n33.  For  instance,  when  Bryan  C.  first  entered  care  at  age  5,  he  suffered  an \napproximately 3 month gap when no caseworker had clear and comprehensive responsibility for, \nor access to, Bryan C.’s medical file containing his critical health information, and, hence, could \nnot adequately monitor him or his medications.  During those three months, no OCFS caseworker \ntook responsibility for his file or his case, such that no one at OCFS was maintaining and promptly \nupdating the file during that period.   \n34.  Even worse, in early March 2020, Bryan C. landed in the emergency room for a \ncrisis evaluation due to suicidal threats and aggression, and shortly thereafter was transferred to a \ncrisis stabilization unit several hours away in Rockport, Maine.  The clinician there expressed \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 10 of 71    PageID #: 10\n \nconcerns that Bryan C.’s medications may need to be changed, since they were seeing many of the \nsame problematic behaviors.  However, Defendants did not provide the unit’s clinicians with a list \nof current and prior medications for the child.  When the clinician reached out to his OCFS \ncaseworker to request it, the caseworker failed to respond to the request and provided no such \ninformation.  As a result, Bryan C. suffered a one-month period during which the clinicians in \ncharge of treating the acute crisis Bryan C. experienced could not access his basic psychotropic \nmedication records needed to sufficiently treat or monitor him.  After the OCFS caseworker finally \ncontacted them, the caseworker reported that they did not have ready access to the information and \ntherefore could not provide the information.  Instead, the caseworker directed Bryan C.’s aunt to \ncontact Bryan C.’s previous psychiatrist to try to learn information about his medications.  \n35.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Bryan C.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n36.  Bryan C. remains in Defendants’ custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \n37.  Bryan C.’s case is brought by his adult Next Friend Mr. Michael P. Dixon. \nii.  Henry B. \n38.  Henry B. is a 15-year-old boy who is currently in foster care custody.  Henry B.’s \ncase is brought by his adult Next Friend Michael P. Dixon. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 11 of 71    PageID #: 11\n \n39.  Henry B. currently resides in Belgrade, Maine in a respite foster home, where he \nhas been for the past several months.  He entered foster care custody from Bridgton, Maine as a \nresult of neglect in July 2018.  Over the last two and a half years that he has been in Maine foster \ncare, Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for his safety and well-being as to how \npsychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n40.  Henry B. has received several psychotropic medications throughout his time in state \ncustody.   \n41.  Henry B.’s current cocktail of medications consists of the following psychotropic \nmedications:  (1) Venlafaxine (an antidepressant); (2) Trazodone (an antidepressant); (3) Clonidine \n(an alpha agonist); (4) Guanfacine (an alpha agonist); and (5) Concerta (a stimulant).   \n42.  Henry B. has received up to six different psychotropic medications at once while \nin state custody.  For instance, Henry B.’s cocktail of psychotropic medications earlier this year \nconsisted  of:    (1)  Bupropion  (Wellbutrin,  an  antidepressant);  (2)  Sertraline  (Zoloft,  an \nantidepressant);  (3)  Trazodone  (an  antidepressant);  (4)  Clonidine  (an  alpha  agonist);  (5) \nGuanfacine (an alpha agonist); and (6) Concerta (a stimulant).   \n43.  To Henry B. and his Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has \nbeen triggered by this polypharmacy.  \n44.  Henry  B.  has  experienced  numerous  adverse  effects  as  a  result  of  these \npsychotropic medications.  \n45.  Henry B. has experienced rapid blinking and a twitch in one eye. \n46.  He has experienced brain fog as well as difficulty processing information. \n47.  While taking psychotropic medications, he has experienced increased aggression, \nsexualized behaviors, and mental health crises.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 12 of 71    PageID #: 12\n \n48.  At the time of the prescription and continued administration of his psychotropic \nmedications, Henry B. and his caregivers were not adequately and consistently informed about the \nrisks,  potential  consequences,  and  alternatives  to  these  medications.    Defendants  did  not \ncommunicate an effective informed consent or assent process through which Henry B. or his \ncaregivers could object to taking medications.   \n49.  Henry  B.  has  not  been  regularly  included  in  meaningful  informed  consent \nconversations about the administration of new or ongoing psychotropic medications, even after he \nturned 14.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have never informed Henry B. that he is able \nto have a meaningful role in the decision-making process.   \n50.  He does not currently understand which psychotropic medications he is on, why he \nis taking them, and what their alternatives are.  Henry B. does not even seem to understand that \nthese psychotropic medications have side effects that could affect him.  \n51.  Over the past two and a half years, Henry B. has had 5 different OCFS caseworkers \nwith minimal involvement in his psychotropic medication decision-making or administration.   \n52.  Henry B. and his caregivers have not received a portable record of critical health \ninformation pertaining to his mental health and psychotropic medications.  \n53.  OCFS has so poorly maintained his mental health records that it is unclear, for \ninstance,  what  Henry  B.’s  mental  health  diagnoses  even  are.    A  comprehensive,  adequate \npsychological evaluation was never performed for this child after entering care.  When Henry B.’s \nnew caseworker asked what his diagnoses were at a recent transition meeting with OCFS and \nothers, no one present from OCFS could answer this question.  When the new caseworker asked \nfor a copy of Henry B.’s initial evaluation—which would contain at least his initial diagnoses, his \ncurrent case manager reported that they did not have a copy of this document. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 13 of 71    PageID #: 13\n \n54.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Henry B.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n55.  Henry B. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \niii.  Trent W. \n56.  Trent W. is an 8-year-old boy currently in foster care custody.  Trent W.’s case is \nbrought by his adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n57.  Trent W. now resides in a crisis unit in Calais, Maine.  He entered state custody in \nJanuary 2020, as a result of extreme neglect.  \n58.  Trent W. spent his first five to six weeks in state custody “hotelled,” that is, cycling \nbetween spending days at a time residing at a hotel supervised by an OCFS caseworker, leaving \nthe hotel to spend days at a “respite” foster home, and then returning to a hotel stay. \n59.  In February 2020, Trent W. was seen by a primary care physician for his initial \nevaluation, a “pediatric rapid evaluation.”  The records from that appointment noted that he “has \nbeen diagnosed with ADHD,” for which he took psychotropic medication.  \n60.  That diagnosis was wrong.  In fact, a 2018 psychological evaluation of Trent W. by \na psychologist had specifically ruled out a diagnosis of ADHD. \n61.  The primary care visit noted that Trent W. was having problems sleeping, and had \nbeen prescribed Trazodone to help with his sleeping issues.    \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 14 of 71    PageID #: 14\n \n62.  Eventually, in March 2020, Trent W. was placed in a therapeutic foster home. \n63.  In late June 2020, Trent W. underwent a psychological re-evaluation.  This re-\nevaluation was conducted by the same psychologist who had performed the 2018 evaluation of \nTrent W.  The re-evaluation concluded that Trent W. had been accurately diagnosed with autism-\nspectrum disorder and that Trent W. had impairments in communication, understanding social \ncues, and interacting with his peers.        \n64.  Notably, the 2020 re-evaluation confirmed the finding made in 2018: that Trent W. \ndid not have ADHD.  \n65.  However, upon being placed into state custody in January 2020 until November \n2020, Trent W. was prescribed, and took, a stimulant psychotropic medication aimed at treating \nthe condition he did not have, ADHD. \n66.  The continued administration of the stimulant medication harmed Trent W. \n67.  Specifically, the psychologist who reevaluated Trent W. in June 2020 noted that his \nthen-current treatment of stimulant medication was “not appropriate and is contra-indicated.”  The \npsychologist further concluded that it was likely that the administration of the psychotropic \nstimulant medication was contributing to Trent W.’s hyperactivity and was exacerbating his sleep \nproblems.  \n68.  According to that psychologist, Trent W.’s worsening behavioral difficulties could \nbe attributed to his medication.  The psychologist noted that the continued medication of Trent W. \nwas concerning based on his previous medical history and diagnoses, which included his diagnoses \nof autism and post-traumatic stress disorder.  \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 15 of 71    PageID #: 15\n \n69.  Nonetheless,  following  his  June  2020  psychological  re-evaluation,  Trent  W. \nremained on the stimulant despite ruling out a diagnosis of ADHD in 2018 and confirming that \nfinding in June 2020. \n70.  On or about November 17, 2020, following an acute crisis he experienced in \nsouthern Maine, Trent W. spent the weekend in the emergency room at Maine General Medical \nCenter in Waterville.  Trent W. was then transferred and admitted to Northern Maine Medical \nCenter, a hospital in Fort Kent.  \n71.  The day after Trent W.’s admission to Northern Maine Medical Center, a team of \nindividuals associated with Trent W.’s care conducted a meeting to assess treatment of his crisis.  \nAttending this meeting were Trent W.’s OCFS caseworker, his guardian ad litem, his private-\ntreatment foster-care coordinator, a social worker, and healthcare providers from the hospital. \n72.  At the meeting, the hospital healthcare providers reported that Trent W. was on a \nstimulant. \n73.  Those team members who had knowledge of Trent W.’s prior medical history noted \nthat Trent W. should not be taking such medication because he did not have a diagnosis of ADHD. \n74.  With  this  information,  the  hospital  later  discontinued  Trent  W.’s  use  of  the \nstimulant. \n75.  The hospital also noted that Trent W. had been taking Trazodone to help with his \nsleeping problems. \n76.  Although the hospital discontinued use of the stimulant, the hospital did prescribe \nTrent W. Abilify to treat anxiety.  Trent W. remains on Abilify today. \n77.  The November 18 meeting with the hospital’s healthcare providers also revealed \nthat the hospital had no medical records for Trent W.  This included a lack of any records \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 16 of 71    PageID #: 16\n \ndocumenting his recent psychological evaluation, his recent pediatric rapid evaluation, or records \nof a prior, crisis-related hospitalization.  \n78.   Accordingly, Trent  W.’s guardian ad litem endeavored to  obtain Trent  W.’s \nrecords from a prior crisis hospitalization and fax them to Northern Maine Medical Center, and \nalso send Trent W.’s available medical history.  The guardian ad litem, however, did not have a \ncopy of Trent W.’s 2020 psychological evaluation and thus that most recent evaluation was not \nimmediately provided to the hospital. \n79.  Subsequently, Trent W. was discharged from the hospital and placed in a crisis unit \nin Calais, where he remains today.  \n80.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Trent W.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, including the administration of \npsychotropic medication for treatment of a diagnosis he did not have; failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process; and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n81.  Trent W. remains in Defendants’ custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices.  \niv.  Grayson M.  \n82.  Grayson M. is an 11-year-old boy from Rumford, Maine who is currently in foster \ncare.  His case is brought by his adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n83.  Grayson M. entered DHHS custody in December 2019 due to long-term physical \nabuse and neglect.  He was separated from his sibling and placed in hotels, a hospital, a crisis unit, \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 17 of 71    PageID #: 17\n \na kinship placement, and foster homes.  Grayson M. has had at least 9 placements over an \napproximately one-year span.  He is currently in a respite placement in South Paris, Maine.  In the \npast year, Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide oversight for Grayson M.’s safety \nand well-being with respect to psychotropic medications. \n84.  Shortly upon entering care, his January 2020 psychological evaluation reported his \nofficial diagnoses to be oppositional defiant disorder (“ODD”) and generalized anxiety disorder \n(“GAD”).  In February 2020, his medication manager reported his diagnoses as ADHD with a \npotential sensory integration disorder, without any reference to the prior diagnoses of ODD or \nGAD.  A few months later in May, his therapeutic agency reported his February diagnoses as \nADHD and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, without reference to his February 2020 potential sensory \nintegration disorder or any of this other diagnoses from January 2020.  In June, a hospital treated \nhim for a mental health crisis and simply reported his diagnosis as adjustment disorder. \n85.  Grayson M. has received psychotropic medications during much of his time in state \ncustody.  These psychotropic medications have included Risperidone (an antipsychotic) and \nMethylphenidate (a stimulant). \n86.  He  has  been  subjected  to  polypharmacy.    At  times,  Grayson  M.  has  been \nadministered Risperidone, Methylphenidate, and Melatonin concurrently.   \n87.  Grayson M. has experienced numerous adverse effects from these psychotropic \nmedications. \n88.  Before coming into state custody, Grayson M. had a substantial, but not positive, \nmedical  history  with  psychotropic  medication.    He  had  been  prescribed  multiple  different \npsychotropic medications, but these medications had adverse, not positive, effects on him.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 18 of 71    PageID #: 18\n \n89.  Upon entering custody, in early 2020, Grayson M. informed clinicians that his \nmedications such as Risperidone did not help him and, rather, did the opposite.  His biological \nmother, who maintained parental rights, expressed apprehension, too.  She reported that such \nmedication made Grayson M. act like a zombie or stay awake for days at a time.  Nonetheless, \nGrayson M. was administered Risperidone thereafter.  He continues to receive it today. \n90.  While being prescribed Methylphenidate in early 2020, 10-year-old Grayson M. \nexperienced increased aggression.   \n91.  Around that time, he made threats to harm others and himself, self-harmed, and \nexperienced suicidal ideations.  \n92.   Both  Grayson  M.  and  his  biological  mother  reported  prior  and  then-current \nhallucinatory effects of his psychotropic medication to his clinician and caseworker in October \n2020.   \n93.  To his Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has been triggered \nby Grayson M.’s polypharmacy or adverse reactions to psychotropic medication.  \n94.  Defendants failed to communicate a sufficient informed consent or assent process \nthrough which a biological parent, his caregivers, or the child could object to Grayson M.’s \nadministration of psychotropic medications.  Accordingly, there is no formal medical record of all \nconcerns voiced by Grayson M.’s biological parent, his caregivers, or Grayson M. himself which \nwould inform clinicians in the future treatment of Grayson M.    \n95.  In fall 2020, Grayson M. attempted to refuse his medications after reporting \nhallucinations.  Grayson M.’s biological mother also objected to the use of the psychotropic \nmedications in light of the hallucinations.  She asked his OCFS caseworker that he be taken off \nthem.  The OCFS caseworker responded that regardless of any hallucinations, he must remain on \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 19 of 71    PageID #: 19\n \nthe medications.  Instead of providing Grayson M.’s biological mother with any meaningful \nopportunity to be heard by a neutral decision-maker, the caseworker simply told her she was \nwelcome to contact his clinician.   \n96.  At the time of these medications’ prescription and while he was taking these \nmedications, Grayson M. and his caregivers were not consistently informed about the intended \npurpose, risks, consequences, and alternatives to treatment through an adequate informed consent \nor assent conversation.  Rather, they have little to no involvement in the decision-making process. \n97.  The  only  record  of  consent  resulted  from  a  cursory  process  initiated  by  the \nhealthcare provider, not by the Defendants.  In February 2020, a clinician faxed the clinician’s \nown consent form to Grayson M.’s OCFS caseworker, requesting the caseworker’s consent to \nprescribe Methylphenidate to Grayson M. after merely noting a few potential side effects.  The \ncaseworker signed the form five days later.  \n98.  Defendants have not provided Grayson M., his caregivers, or his medical doctors a \ncomprehensive, up-to-date medical record of current and past medications, potential adverse \neffects  and  instructions  for  current  medications,  past  adverse  reactions  to  psychotropic \nmedications, or biological family medical history.   \n99.  In Grayson M.’s recent crisis hospital stay from early October 2020 to early \nNovember 2020, upon information and belief, the hospital did not receive adequate medical and \nmental health records for Grayson M. \n100.  There is no known, up-to-date summary of Grayson M.’s medical and mental health \nhistory and treatment that has moved with him from placement to placement.  \n101.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Grayson M.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 20 of 71    PageID #: 20\n \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to maintain and disseminate current medical and mental \nhealth records. \n102.  Grayson M. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of harm as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices.   \nv.  Kendall P.  \n103.  Kendall P. is a 17-year-old girl from Rangeley, Maine who is currently in Maine \nfoster care custody.  Kendall P.’s case is brought by her adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n104.  Kendall P. has been subjected to neglect and physical abuse for most of her life.  \nMaine DHHS first took custody of her when she was 3 months old through 18 months old due to \nneglect by her mother.   DHHS and OCFS returned when she was 7 years old, after her mother \noverdosed on medications and attempted suicide in front of her.  After intermittent non-custodial \ninvolvement, DHHS took custody of Kendall P. again at age 15 in May 2019.  By then, she had \nbeen subjected to long-term sexual abuse.   \n105.  Since  most  recently  entering  custody  in  May  2019,  Kendall  P.  has  had \napproximately 9 different placements.  She has been shuffled through unlicensed and licensed \nhomes, treatment centers, and hospital crisis units and emergency rooms throughout Maine, such \nas in Portland, Auburn, Rangeley, Farmington, Lewiston, and Bangor.   \n106.  Kendall P.’s recent mental health diagnoses are PTSD, ADHD, and an unspecified \nmood disorder.   Her prior diagnoses have included Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 21 of 71    PageID #: 21\n \n107.  Kendall P. has been repeatedly administered psychotropic medications while in \nstate custody, and Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for Kendall P.’s safety and \nwell-being as to how psychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n108.  Her current medication cocktail consists of: (1) Abilify (atypical antipsychotic); (2) \nHydroxyzine Pamoate (anti-anxiety sedative, generic for Vistaril); (3) Prazosin HCI (anti-anxiety \nalpha blocker, generic for Minipress); (4) Strattera (antidepressant sNRI whose FDA indication is \nto treat ADHD); (5) Lexapro (antidepressant SSRI); and (6) Propranolol (anti-anxiety beta blocker, \ngeneric for Inderal). \n109.  Kendall P. has experienced numerous adverse effects as a result of the psychotropic \nmedications she’s been administered. \n110.  In Kendall P.’s own words, she does not feel right when she is taking psychotropic \nmedications.  Instead, she often feels like a “zombie.”  At other times, she feels as if she’s crawling \nout of her own skin.   \n111.  She  has  suffered  increased  anxiety  and  depression  while  taking  psychotropic \nmedications. \n112.  Kendall P. has experienced suicidal ideations as well as attempted harm toward \nherself and others.  In June 2020, she eloped from a residential treatment home to lay down in the \nmiddle of a four-way intersection in the middle of a rainy night, intending to kill herself.  In July \n2020, Defendants then sent Kendall P. to a residential treatment center in Bennington, Vermont, \nwhere she remains today under DHHS custody. \n113.  Kendall P. has also experienced severe weight gain due to psychotropic medication.  \nFrom April 2020 to October 2020, she gained over 60 pounds while taking the antipsychotic \nZyprexa, known to cause severe weight gain.  She reported this to her clinicians and explained that \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 22 of 71    PageID #: 22\n \nher body felt very heavy, she had a hard time moving her body, and she did not feel like herself.  \nNonetheless, she remained on this medication for months. \n114.  At the time of these medications’ prescription and while she was taking these \nmedications, Kendall P. and her caregivers were not adequately informed about the risks, potential \nconsequences of, and alternatives to these medications.   \n115.  Defendants did not communicate an effective informed consent or assent process \nthrough which Kendall P. or her caregivers could object to taking medications.  Due to the lack of \na clear informed consent and assent process, Kendall P. often continued taking psychotropic \nmedications that actively harmed her because Defendants did not define a coherent path for \nrefusing her medications and transitioning to less harmful treatments or medications.   \n116.  Kendall P. repeatedly requested to stop or revisit her psychotropic medication \nprescriptions.  Unfortunately, however, this was typically ignored by her OCFS caseworkers and \nproviders. \n117.  On  one  occasion  on  or  about  May  2020,  Kendall  P.  reported  to  her  OCFS \ncaseworker her concerns about the way that Zyprexa harmed her.  Instead of providing her with \nany information about Kendall P.’s decision-making role or any process to be heard by a neutral \ndecision maker, the caseworker incorrectly informed Kendall P. that they must do whatever her \ndoctor says.  Kendall P. subsequently met with the doctor and her guardian ad litem Next Friend \nto inform the doctor of these adverse effects and to request to be taken off the medications.  When \nKendall P. asked if there were any alternatives to these medications, the doctor replied no and that \nshe needed to remain on the medication.  Kendall P. felt defeated and anxious. She believes that \nshe does not have any voice or autonomy with respect to her psychotropic medications. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 23 of 71    PageID #: 23\n \n118.  Instead of being adequately informed and involved in the decision-making process \nfor medication changes, Kendall P. is often notified of medication changes after the fact.  This has \nfurthered her anxiety.   \n119.  For instance, in the first week of December 2020, her caseworker and clinician \nmade a decision about a medication change for Kendall P. without involving Kendall P. in any \ncapacity.  On December 8, 2020, her guardian ad litem Next Friend reported to her OCFS \ncaseworker, aunt, and clinician that Kendall P. feels like her recent medication change has caused \nincreased anxiety along with night terrors, fears of being attacked, and inability to sleep.  On \nDecember 9, the clinician reported to the Next Friend that the OCFS caseworker recently approved \na medication change to begin the following day to help with anxiety.  When her Next Friend \nmentioned the medication change to Kendall P., Kendall P. asked what she was talking about.  \nKendall P. was never involved in any conversation to discuss any specific proposed change, ask \nquestions, consider the risks and benefits, learn about alternatives, or provide consent.  Kendall P. \nbecame confused and even more anxious.  When she informed staff about her anxiety over this \nunknown medication change, staff directed Kendall P. to take her anxiety medication.   \n120.  This early December surprise medication change ended up being the addition of \nLexapro, which has reportedly not helped with her anxiety. \n121.  One week later in mid-December, Kendall P. was subjected to another surprise \nmedication change.  Similarly, this new psychotropic medication was approved without Kendall \nP.’s  involvement  in  the  decision-making  process.    Unbeknownst  to  Kendall  P.,  her  OCFS \ncaseworker and her clinician reached out to Kendall P.’s medication provider to request and \napprove a medication change.  Her clinician notified Kendall P. after the fact that Kendall P. would \nbe adding Propranolol to her cocktail of drugs.  Kendall P. felt upset but agreed to try the \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 24 of 71    PageID #: 24\n \nmedication to avoid trouble.  The day after Kendall P. tried the Propranolol, she felt so fatigued \nthat she slept the entire day.  She worries that the Propranolol will continue to interfere with her \nfunctioning and her goals.  In Kendall’s own words, “I don’t want another med[ication]; I wanted \nsupport for the anxiety.”  \n122.  Kendall  P.’s  foster  parent  recently  expressed  concerns  about  Kendall  P.’s \npsychotropic medications.  Her aunt suggested to Kendall P.’s OCFS caseworker and clinician that \nit may be better for Kendall P. to be removed from all of her medications, like a doctor had once \ndone years prior.  The caseworker did not address her concern or otherwise provide her with any \nopportunity to be heard.    \n123.  To Kendall P. and her Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has \nbeen triggered by any of this.  \n124.  Defendants have not given Kendall P., her caregivers, or her medical doctors an up-\nto-date comprehensive medical and mental health record of her current and past medications, \npotential and past adverse effects, instructions, or biological family medical history.   \n125.  For instance, Kendall P. was previously placed in two residential treatment centers \nprior to her current DHHS custody period.  However, there is no medication history or any record \nof her prior treatments from those facilities accessible to those charged with caring for Kendall P.   \n126.  Kendall P. and her Next Friend are not aware of any portable record of her critical \nmental health information that has moved with her from placement to placement. \n127.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Kendall P.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect her from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 25 of 71    PageID #: 25\n \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide her caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n128.  Kendall P. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \nvi.  Neville H.  \n129.  Neville H. is a 10-year-old boy from Biddeford, Maine who is currently in Maine \nfoster care custody.  At age 4, he was removed from his home due to abuse and neglect.  Neville \nH.’s case is brought by his adult Next Friend Sandra Romano-Shain.  \n130.  While in foster care, Neville H. has been placed in 4 different foster homes and 2 \nresidential placements throughout Maine:  Long Island, Buxton, Cornish, Kennebunk, Auburn, \nand  Bridgton.  During  the  span  of  these  varied  placements,  he  had  5  separate \nhospitalizations.  Neville H. currently lives in a residential group home in Bridgton. \n131.  Neville H.’s recent mental health diagnoses are chronic PTSD, disruptive behavior \ndisorder, and reactive attachment disorder.   \n132.  He has been repeatedly administered psychotropic medications while in state \ncustody, and Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for Neville H.’s safety and well-\nbeing as to how psychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n133.  Shortly after  entering  foster care, he  was  administered Tenex to manage his \nbehavior.   \n134.  At age 5, he was placed on Prozac, an antidepressant.  Neville H.’s long-term \ntherapist expressed anger and confusion to his OCFS caseworker about the administration of \nProzac to Neville H., who was only in kindergarten at the time.  Upon information and belief, \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 26 of 71    PageID #: 26\n \nDefendants did not follow-up with the prescriber or conduct any sort of secondary review in \nresponse.  \n135.  Neville H. has been subjected to polypharmacy while in state care. \n136.  His current medication cocktail consists of Seroquel (an atypical antipsychotic), \nGuanfacine (an alpha agonist), and Melatonin.   \n137.  Neville  H.  has  experienced  adverse  effects  as  a  result  of  the  psychotropic \nmedications he has been administered. \n138.  For instance, while taking Seroquel, he experienced a 30 to 40 pound weight gain \nover the course 6 months.  At a meeting with his OCFS caseworker, a doctor suggested that \nSeroquel caused his weight gain.  Neville H. remains on Seroquel. \n139.  Neville H. has experienced lethargy and drowsiness.  Although he entered care as \na vivacious,  engaging  youngster,  he now struggles to  carry  a conversation and avoids eye \ncontact.  Although he has been found to be of average intelligence, 10-year-old Neville H. tests at \na first grade reading level and a second grade math level. \n140.  He has experienced suicidal ideation and increased aggression.     \n141.  Neville H.’s Next Friend recounts that his behaviors have only become worse after \nhe began taking psychotropic medications, such that “he is not the same child.”  \n142.  The long-term administration of psychotropic medications to Neville H. from age \n5 though today at age 10 has not helped to improve his behaviors.  \n143.  Defendants have not communicated an effective informed consent or assent process \nthrough which Neville H. and his caregivers could meaningfully participate in the informed \nconsent process.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 27 of 71    PageID #: 27\n \n144.  Prior to his psychotropic medications’ prescriptions and during their continued \nadministration, Neville H. and his caregivers were not consistently informed about the intended \npurposes, risks, potential consequences of, and alternatives to his psychotropic medications.   \n145.  Neville H.’s assent is not regularly sought from him, nor is he regularly included in \nconversations about his medications. \n146.  In summer 2017, a doctor removed a medication from Neville H.’s cocktail and \nprescribed a new medication, but his foster parents only learned of these medication changes after \nthe fact.  They were not involved in any meaningful informed consent process prior to these \nchanges and later objected to their lack of any involvement.  \n147.  To his Next Friend’s knowledge, no meaningful secondary review process has been \ntriggered for Neville H. \n148.  Defendants  have not  provided Neville H. and  all  his  caregivers and  medical \nproviders with a current, updated comprehensive medical and mental health record for Neville H. \n149.  For instance, a doctor treating Neville H. in a psychiatric hospital informed an \nOCFS caseworker that he did not have Neville H.’s psychotropic medication history.  Specifically, \nhe considered the possibility of treating Neville H. with a new antidepressant or anti-anxiety \nmedication, but he did not know if Neville H. was previously administered the antidepressant \nProzac or the antipsychotics Risperidone or Abilify, or how those medications may have fared in \nthe past. \n150.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Neville H.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a meaningful \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 28 of 71    PageID #: 28\n \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n151.  Neville H. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \nB.  The Next Friends   \n152.  Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(2), Plaintiffs Bryan C. and Henry B. appear \nthrough their Next Friend Mr. Michael P. Dixon.  Mr. Dixon has been an attorney guardian ad \nlitem based in the Portland, Maine area for the past 7 years.  He knows Bryan C. personally, and \nhe has served as Bryan C.’s guardian ad litem from early 2019 to the present.  He also knows \nHenry B. personally, having served as Henry B.’s guardian ad litem from mid-2018 to the present.  \nMr.  Dixon  has  observed  Defendants’  failure  to  adequately  oversee  the  administration  of \npsychotropic drugs to Bryan C. and Henry B.

Lambrew, Ph.D., the Commissioner of the Maine DHHS, is sued in her \nofficial capacity only.  Defendant Lambrew maintains her principal office at Maine DHHS, 109 \nCapitol Street, Augusta, Maine 04333.  Defendant Lambrew is vested under state law with “all of \nthe powers and duties necessary to carry out the mission and responsibilities” of DHHS.  The \nmission and responsibilities of DHHS expressly include “provid[ing] supportive, preventive, \nprotective,  public  health  and  intervention  services  to  children,  families  and  adults,”  and \n“assist[ing] individuals in meeting their needs and families in providing for the developmental, \nhealth and safety needs of their children, while respecting the rights and preferences of the \nindividual or family.”  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 30 of 71    PageID #: 30\n \n156.  Todd A. Landry, the Director of the Maine OCFS, also known as the Central Bureau \nof Child and Family Services, is sued in his official capacity only.  Defendant Landry maintains \nhis principal office at the Maine OCFS Central Office, 2 Anthony Avenue, 11 State House Station, \nAugusta, Maine 04333.  Defendant Landry oversees the office that is “primarily responsible for \nthe  development,  delivery  and  oversight  of  all  activities  attendant  to  Child  Protective  and \nChildren’s Services,” and which “drafts, implements and monitors all aspects of programs relating \nto child welfare by way of State Plan for Child Welfare Services.” \n157.  Ms. Lambrew and Mr. Landry, in their official capacities as Commissioner of \nDHHS and Secretary of OCFS, respectively, are responsible for Maine’s Title IV-E Agency, which \nis the State of Maine, Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child and Family \nServices. \nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n158.  Plaintiffs Bryan C., Henry B., Trent W., Grayson M., Kendall P., and Neville H. \nbring this action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated children.  \n159.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n160.  The putative class (“the Class”) is defined as all children who are or will be in \nDHHS foster care custody and who are or will be prescribed or administered one or more \npsychotropic medication while in state care.  Psychotropic medications are medications that impact \nemotions or behavior.  Psychotropic medications include medications in the drug classes of:  \nantidepressants;  antipsychotics;  stimulants;  alpha  agonists  (e.g.,  Clonidine,  Guanfacine); \nanxiolytics (anti-anxiety) / hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines); and mood \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 31 of 71    PageID #: 31\n \nstabilizers  (e.g.,  lithium).    They  also  include  medications  from  the  anticonvulsant  and \nantihypertensive drug classes when the medication is prescribed for a behavioral health indication.    \n161.  The  Class  is  sufficiently  numerous  to  make  joinder  impracticable.    Upon \ninformation and belief, at least hundreds of children in Maine foster care receive psychotropic \nmedications.  As of December 1, 2020, an estimated 2,316 children were in the legal custody of \nDHHS.  Defendant Landry stated in November 2019 that 20.8% of children in Maine foster care \nwere administered one or more psychotropic medications.  That would equate to almost 500 \nchildren in the current foster care population.  Joinder of hundreds of children would be unduly \nburdensome and impractical in these circumstances. \n162.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests \nof the entire Class. \n163.  The violations of law and resulting harms averred by the Named Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all class members. \n164.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a Next Friend.  Each Next Friend has sufficient \nknowledge and familiarity with the facts of their respective Named Plaintiffs as well as the \nsystemic common deficiencies underlying this complaint.  Each Next Friend is dedicated to fairly \nand adequately representing the best interests of their respective Named Plaintiffs as well as the \nbest interests of the putative class.  \n165.  Named Plaintiffs and the Class are represented by attorneys employed by: (i) \nChildren’s Rights, a non-profit organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and \nexpertise in child welfare institutional reform class actions; (ii) Bernstein Shur, a private law firm \nbased in Portland with  extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, \nincluding class action litigation; and (iii) Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit civil legal aid and \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 32 of 71    PageID #: 32\n \neconomic justice organization working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for \npeople  in  Maine  with  deep  knowledge  and  expertise  on  Maine’s  state  agencies  and  local \npopulation. \n166.  These attorneys (collectively, “Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) have identified and thoroughly \ninvestigated all claims in this action, and they have committed sufficient resources to represent the \nClass. \n167.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, \nnecessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel knows of no \nconflicts among class members. \n168.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiffs’ claims are common to \nand typical of those raised by the putative class of children they seek to represent.  Each child in \nthe Class relies on Defendants for their safety and well-being, including their physical and mental \nhealth.  The longstanding and well-known systemic deficiencies of DHHS and OCFS in relation \nto its centralized administration and oversight of psychotropic medications place all children in \nfoster care custody at a common and ongoing risk of harm.  \n169.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nmembers of the Class, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. \n170.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \ni.  Whether  Defendants,  through  their  actions  and  inactions,  have \ndemonstrated  a  uniform  policy,  pattern,  custom  and/or  practice  of \ninadequately monitoring and overseeing the administration of psychotropic \nmedications to children in the custody of DHHS by failing to: (a) maintain \ncomplete, current, and reasonably accessible medical records, including \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 33 of 71    PageID #: 33\n \nmedication history for children in foster care, and to provide these records \nto foster caregivers and health care providers to facilitate the effective \ndelivery of services;  (b) operate a statewide secondary  review system \ncapable of timely identifying and addressing outlier prescribing practices to \nassure the safe administration of drugs to foster children; (c) ensure that \nadequate  informed  consent  with  adequate  notice  and  a  meaningful \nopportunity to be heard is obtained prior to and throughout the time that \nchildren in foster care are administered any psychotropic medications, or \ninstitute a procedure to ensure that all psychotropic medications are given \nappropriately and only when necessary; and (d) maintain a uniform policy, \npattern,  custom,  and/or  practice  providing  for  periodic  review  or \nreconsideration  of  the  prescription  and  administration  of  psychotropic \nmedications to children in foster care. \nii.  Whether these systemic failures result in harm or the substantial risk of \nserious harm to children administered psychotropic medications while in \nDHHS custody. \n171.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \ni.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s substantive due process rights to be free \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm while in state custody, as guaranteed by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nii.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s procedural due process rights to be free \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 34 of 71    PageID #: 34\n \nfrom the unnecessary and inappropriate administration of psychotropic \nmedication as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, including whether the Class, through an independent \nadult, receives adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard; \niii.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s rights under the Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”) to have their medical records \nkept  up-to-date  and  timely  delivered  to  their  foster  caretakers  upon \nplacement in their home; and  \niv.  Whether the class members are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief \nto vindicate the rights they have been denied. \nV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Substantial Risks of Emotional, Psychological, and Physical Harm Attend the Use of \nPsychotropic Medications in Children.    \n \n172.  As a federal district court in Missouri recently explained in M.B. v. Corsi, No. 2:17-\nCV-04102-NKL, 2018 WL 327767, at *2 (W.D. Mo. Jan. 8, 2018), “psychotropic drugs are \npowerful medications that directly affect the central nervous system. They are particularly potent \nwhen administered to children.  Children administered psychotropic medications are at particularly \nserious risk of long-lasting adverse effects. They are more vulnerable to psychosis, seizures, \nirreversible movement disorders, suicidal thoughts, aggression, weight gain, organ damage, and [] \nlife-threatening conditions,” among other things.  “Thus, due to the serious risks associated with \npsychotropic drugs, they should be administered to children only when necessary, and safely, and \naccordingly it is critical that children being administered these medications are monitored.”  Id. at \n*3. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 35 of 71    PageID #: 35\n \n173.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not approved the use of many \npsychotropic medication for children, as they have not proven safe and effective in children.  For \nthose psychotropic medications that are FDA-approved for children or adolescents, FDA approval \ntypically limits usage to children with specific serious diagnoses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar \ndisorder, and older age groups.  For instance, not a single atypical antipsychotic—such as \nAripiprazole/Abilify, Risperidone/Risperdal, Quetiapine/Seroquel and Paliperidone/Invega—has \nbeen approved for children under age 5. \n174.  Little  scientific  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of \npsychotropic medications in children, in contrast to rigorous testing in the adult population.  Given \nthis circumstance, the medical, legal, and child welfare communities have all deemed the use of \npsychotropic medications in children particularly risky. \n175.  For instance, the American Bar Association has stated that “[l]ittle is known about \nhow [psychotropic] medications impact children and adolescents in the short or long term. \nChildren are not just ‘mini adults’; they cannot just be given a smaller dose because they have \nsmaller bodies.” \n176.  More recently, the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry \nand Allied Professions (“IACAPAP”) stated that “[p]harmacological treatment during human \ndevelopment [such as childhood and adolescence] may result in toxicities that are not seen in adults \n. . . and result in unwanted long-lasting changes.” \n177.  The Administration for Children and Families (“ACF”), the office within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services charged with administering the federal Title IV-E \nfoster care program, acknowledged in 2019 that “research on the safe and appropriate pediatric \nuse of psychotropic medications lags behind prescribing trends. . . . In the absence of such research, \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 36 of 71    PageID #: 36\n \nit is not possible to know all of the short- and long-term effects, both positive and negative, of \npsychotropic medications on young minds and bodies.” \n178.  All of these uncertainties have not stopped physicians or others from routinely \nprescribing these drugs to children “off-label,” a term the FDA defines as the “[u]napproved use \nof an approved drug.”  At least one study has shown that approximately 45% of medications to \ntreat emotional or behavioral disturbances in children or adolescents are prescribed off-label. \n179.  While some of the risks to children may not be well known, psychotropic drugs are \nalready known to cause serious and sometimes irreversible side effects, even in adults.  These well-\ndocumented physical and mental harms include:  \n  Kidney, thyroid, liver and pancreas damage; \n  Psychosis, suicidal thoughts, and agitation; \n  Blurred vision; \n  Nightmares and hallucinations; \n  Drowsiness and dizziness; \n  Irreversible movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), rigidity, tremor and \ntics; \n  Seizures; and  \n  Weight gain, diabetes and high cholesterol. \n \n180.  Multiple expert research bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics \n(“AAP”), the Government Accountability Office, the IACAPAP, the American Association of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry (“AACAP”), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Association (“SAMHSA”) have all stated the need for further research on the safety, \neffectiveness, and long-term effects of psychotropic medications in children. \n181.  In the developing brain and body of a child, psychotropic medications may induce \nadverse effects more frequently and with greater severity. A 2019 medical review article that \nexamined  a  decade  (2007-2017)  of  FDA  drug  trial  data  for  common  antipsychotics  and \nantidepressants found that adverse drug effects were significantly worse for children than adults \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 37 of 71    PageID #: 37\n \nin over 60% of the studied combinations of medications.  Recent studies have linked psychotropic \nmedications to the worsening of certain liver conditions in children, linked stimulant psychotropic \nmedications to elevated cardiovascular risk factors, and demonstrated disturbing links between \nantipsychotics and unexplained deaths among youth. \n182.  A  2018  psychiatry  clinical  trial  concluded  that  the  “potential  benefits  [of \nantipsychotic medications] should be carefully weighed against the risk for adverse changes in \ntotal and abdominal adiposity and insulin sensitivity, known contributors to the development of \nearly-onset type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses associated with premature \nmorbidity and mortality.” \n183.  Many psychotropic medications—including all second generation antipsychotics  \nand SSRIs—come with “black box” warning labels indicating that “their use requires particular \nattention and caution regarding potentially dangerous or life threatening side effects.”  It is \ncommonly recognized that these drugs may increase the risk of “suicidal thinking and behavior \n(suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults,” and that patients starting these drugs \nshould be “monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or \nunusual changes in behavior.”  The stimulant class of psychotropics, commonly used to treat \nADHD, carries a black box warning for abuse potential, sudden death, and serious cardiovascular \nevents.  Black box warnings for mood stabilizing and anticonvulsant psychotropics also include \npotentially life-threatening complications. \n184.  Given the numerous side effect profiles, there are strict recommended metabolic \nmonitoring  schedules  for  the  various  psychotropic  drug  classes  that  include  baseline  blood \npressure, body mass index, blood glucose, and lipid panels, as well as follow-up monitoring every \nfour weeks for the first twelve weeks, followed by quarterly measurements throughout treatment.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 38 of 71    PageID #: 38\n \nHowever, those monitoring schedules are often not followed.  A 2018 review of Medicaid Analytic \nExtract data found that only approximately 8% of foster children on antipsychotics received \nbaseline metabolic screening and only approximately 25% reported evidence of any annual \nmetabolic laboratory monitoring.  Given psychotropic medications’ serious side effects, the failure \nto monitor them can have life-threatening consequences.  Hence, strict monitoring and effective \noversight policies are crucial. \n185.  AACAP, the leading professional organization dedicated to promoting psychiatric \ncare and healthy development of children and adolescents, posits that “[b]est practice does not \ninvolve psychotropic medication as the sole intervention for youth with complex mental health \nneeds.  Psychosocial interventions, particularly those that are evidence-based and systematically \nmonitored, are also essential.” \n186.  An ACF report using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-\nBeing explained that “the use of medications without simultaneous use of psychosocial treatments” \nequates to potential inappropriate psychotropic medication use.  \n187.  SAMHSA describes the need for a two-step monitoring process prior to prescribing \nantipsychotics to youth and over the course of their care that answer the following questions: \nA)  Prior to initiation: “Has the patient received an adequate trial of first‐line, \nevidence‐based psychosocial therapy and medication treatments before starting an \nantipsychotic?” \n \nB) Over the course of care: “What is the plan to monitor risks and benefits of \ntreatment and timeframe that ineffective or poorly tolerated medication will be \ndiscontinued?” \n188.  Too frequently, psychotropic medications are administered to achieve behavioral \ncontrol rather than to treat an underlying trauma.  For instance, for some mental health disorders \nsuch  as  Reactive  Attachment  Disorder  or  Disinhibited  Social  Engagement  Disorder,  no \npsychopharmacological  intervention  trials  have  been  conducted  to  date,  nor  are  there  any \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 39 of 71    PageID #: 39\n \nindications to prescribe medications to treat these disorders, yet children are still prescribed \npsychotropic medications to “treat” these disorders. \n189.  Children in foster care are also particularly vulnerable to high-risk prescriptions \nbecause “the majority of physicians responsible for prescribing psychotropic medication to foster \nchildren are pediatricians or general psychiatrists without formal training in child and adolescent \npsychiatry and may not have an abundance of exposure to concerns specific to children in foster \ncare.”  AACAP practice guidelines makes clear that a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation of a \nchild should be completed before any pharmacological intervention is considered.  Such an \nevaluation “increases the likelihood that medication interventions will be well conceptualized and \nhopefully reduce the likelihood of treatment failure and poor adherence.”   However, despite these \nrecommendations, a 2018 Medicaid data review study found that over 40% of foster children with \nantipsychotic  prescriptions  did  not  receive  appropriate  first-line  psychosocial  care  prior  to \ninitiation of the medications. \n190.  Given  the  lack  of  research  on  the  safe  and  appropriate  use  of  psychotropic \nmedications in children, and the inherent vulnerabilities of this population, it is of particular \nconcern when children in foster care are exposed to “outlier” prescribing practices.  In 2012, ACF \nissued guidance to states on implementing effective oversight of psychotropic medications for \nyouth in foster care.  ACF defined “outlier practices” as “[p]atterns that may signal that factors \nother than clinical need are impacting the prescription of psychotropic medications.”  As a federal \njudge noted in 2018, this means that “for many, if not most, of the affected children, psychotropic \ndrugs are administered to treat a diagnosis that the drugs were never designed to address” in \nchildren.  M.B. v. Corsi, 2018 WL 327767 at *2. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 40 of 71    PageID #: 40\n \n191.  ACF has identified the following three outlier areas of concern that should trigger \nheightened scrutiny: “instances where children are prescribed too many psychotropic medications, \ntoo much medication, or at too young an age,” commonly referred to as “too many, too much, and \ntoo young.”  Foster children have been found to be at increased risk of all three of these harmful \npractices. \n192.  Too many.  Polypharmacy (the use of multiple psychotropic medications at once) \nis increasingly prevalent in the foster care population, despite long-standing awareness of “the lack \nof supporting evidence and the potential for adverse effects (e.g., side effects, drug interactions, \nmetabolic effects, and potential that some medications may alter nervous system development).”   \nEvidence from a Medicaid data review shows that foster children are over two times more likely \nto be prescribed multiple concurrent antipsychotics than their non-foster Medicaid insured peers. \n193.  There is “scant evidence” that using multiple psychotropic medications at once is \neffective in children, particularly of the antipsychotic class, and no research exists to support the \nuse of five or more psychotropic drugs in tandem.  Leading medical guidance bodies including \nSAMHSA and AACAP both support the need to start “low and go slow” and ensure appropriate \nclinical monitoring throughout. \n194.  Experts report that “increasing the number of drugs used concurrently increases the \nlikelihood of adverse reactions and long-term side effects, such as high cholesterol or diabetes, \nand limits the ability to assess which of multiple drugs are related to a particular treatment goal.” \nFor  instance,  medical  research  studying  the  incidence  of  type  2  diabetes  among  children \nadministered an antipsychotic medication found that children given an antipsychotic were three \ntimes more likely than non-medicated children to suffer from diabetes.  Multiple studies show side \neffects increase with polypharmacy, with one study showing five times the risk of obesity with \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 41 of 71    PageID #: 41\n \ntwo or more antipsychotics.  Additional research has found the risk of developing diabetes was \neven greater for children given an antidepressant concurrently with the antipsychotic. \n195.  Another study gathering information from parents about adverse effects of one or \nmore psychotropic medications given to youth found: \n  The number of adverse effects increased with the number of medications being \nused.  In comparison with children taking one medication, those taking two drugs \nreported on average 17% more adverse effects while those taking three or more \nmedications reported on average 38% more adverse effects.  \n  The side effect profile  shifted for children depending  upon the number of \nmedications  taken.    Suicidality  and  self-harm  became  more  frequent  with \nincreasing numbers of medication.  Increased appetite, sleepiness/fatigue, and \ntics and tremors were approximately 200 to 300% more prevalent among children \ntaking three or more medications than those taking only one drug.  \n  The  number  of  adverse  effects  increased  the  longer  the  child  was  on  the \nmedication. \n  Polypharmacy  regimens  including  antidepressants  (SSRIs)  or  antipsychotics \nwere especially associated with adverse effects. \n \n196.  Children in foster care are frequently subjected to polypharmacy practices.  For \ninstance,  they  are  frequently  administered  an  antidepressant  psychotropic  and  a  stimulant \npsychotropic concurrently.  Data to substantiate the safety and efficacy of this combination of \ndrugs is lacking.   \n197.  Additionally, a recent study found low rates of de-prescribing of antipsychotics \namong foster youth.  This means that once a provider prescribes a psychotropic medication, they \nare less likely to remove this drug in the future, even when clinically warranted. \n198.  An ACF report using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-\nBeing stated that “the use of three or more medications simultaneously” constitutes a potentially \ninappropriate psychotropic use. \n199.  Too  much.    Because  the  majority  of  pediatric  psychotropic  medication  is \nprescribed off-label, there are very few research-based guidelines for medication dosages, which \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 42 of 71    PageID #: 42\n \nwould typically be supplied by FDA prescription labels.  For this reason, it is a cause for concern \nwhen children are prescribed these medications at dosages that exceed recommendations. \n200.  The above-mentioned 2018 ten-state Medicaid study showed that foster children, \neven when compared to other Medicaid-insured youth, are twice as likely to receive higher than \nrecommended doses of antipsychotics.  Experts report that this practice “increases the risk of \nadverse side effects and does not typically increase the efficacy of the drugs to any significant \nextent.” \n201.  Too young.  Young children are particularly vulnerable to the possible adverse side \neffects  of  psychotropic  medications.    For  instance,  experts  have  reported  that  there  is  “no \nestablished use [for psychotropic medications] for mental health conditions in infants [under age \none]; providing them these drugs could result in serious adverse effects.”  Moreover, it is generally \naccepted that drugs in the class of atypical antipsychotics, one of the most powerful psychotropic \ndrug categories, should never be administered to children below the age of 5.  An ACF report using \ndata from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being concluded that “the use of \nmedications in children under the age of 6 years” or “the use of any antipsychotic for all ages and, \nspecifically, for children under the age of 6 years” consists of potential inappropriate psychotropic \nuse. \nB.  Federal Law and Professional Standards Require That States Have in Place a \nSystem  to  Oversee  the  Administration  of  Psychotropic  Medications  to \nChildren in Foster Care.  \n \n202.  The  vital  need  for  rigorous  and  effective  administration  and  oversight  of \npsychotropic medication use for children in foster care is well-established.   \n203.  Under federal law, the “Maine Department of Health and Human Services[], Office \nof Child and Family Services” must develop “a plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 43 of 71    PageID #: 43\n \nhealth care services for any child in a foster care placement,” which must include “an outline of . \n. . the oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for the appropriate use and \nmonitoring of psychotropic medications.”  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(15)(A), 622(b)(15)(A)(v).    \n204.  ACF has directed that “[s]trengthened oversight of psychotropic medication use is \nnecessary in order to responsibly and effectively attend to the clinical needs of children who have \nexperienced  maltreatment”  and  urged  “close  supervision  and  monitoring  .  .  .  [and]  careful \nmanagement and oversight” in the use of psychotropic medications for children. \n205.  “For the[ir] APSR [Annual Progress and Services Report] submission,” ACF \nrequires that:  \nStates must provide information on . . . [t]he protocols used to \nmonitor  the  appropriate  use  of  psychotropic  medications  for \nchildren and youth in the foster care system.  States must support \ntheir choice of protocols and provide additional information on how \nthe  child  welfare  workforce  and  providers  are  trained  on  the \nappropriate use of psychotropic medications.  The State’s protocol \nmust address:  \n \n Comprehensive  and  coordinated  screening,  assessment,  and \ntreatment  planning  mechanisms  to  identify  children’s  mental \nhealth  and  trauma-treatment  needs  (including  a  psychiatric \nevaluation,  as  necessary,  to  identify  needs  for  psychotropic \nmedication);  \n Informed and shared decision-making (consent and assent) and \nmethods for ongoing communication between the prescriber, the \nchild,  his/her caregivers, other  healthcare providers, the child \nwelfare worker, and other key stakeholders;  \n Effective medication monitoring at both the client and agency \nlevel;  \n Availability of mental health expertise and consultation regarding \nboth consent and monitoring issues by a board-certified or board-\neligible Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist (at both the agency and \nindividual case level); and  \n Mechanisms  for  sharing  accurate  and  up-to-date  information \nrelated to psychotropics to clinicians, child welfare staff, and \nconsumers.  This should include both data sharing mechanisms \n(e.g., integrated information systems) and methods for sharing \neducational materials. \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 44 of 71    PageID #: 44\n \n \n206.  Additionally, AACAP has published recommended practices for child welfare \nagencies to implement in overseeing the mental health treatment of children in foster care, \nincluding active monitoring to assure safe utilization of psychotropic medications.  AACAP \nexplained that children in state custody “often have no consistent interested party to provide \ninformed consent for their treatment, to coordinate treatment planning and clinical care, or to \nprovide longitudinal oversight of their treatment.”  Thus, “[t]he state has a duty to perform this \nprotective role for children in state custody.” \n207.  A 2019 Research Summary by the publicly-funded Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute (“PCORI”) recommended that states implement six policies and practices \nconcerning psychotropic medication and oversight for  youth in out-of-home care, based on \n“current research and best practices”:  \n  Implement  a  robust  informed  consent  and  informed  assent \npolicy that ensures consenters and youth have the information \nthey  need  and  access  to  consult  a  child  and  adolescent \npsychiatrist to make a truly informed decision; \n  Create  a  centralized,  up-to-date,  accessible  medical  records \nsystem; \n  Implement  monitoring  and  oversight  systems  that  will  flag \ndangerous outlier prescribing practices for peer review both \nprospectively and retrospectively, and will seek to curb such \npractices moving forward; \n  Promote safe prescribing practices, including by ensuring the \navailability  of  concurrent  psychosocial  services  and  closely \ntracking required bloodwork monitoring; \n  Provide ready access to pertinent information for clinicians, \nfoster parents, and other caregivers; [and] \n  Collect, track, and analyze relevant data to evaluate the efficacy \nof various initiatives implemented. \n \n208.  Over the past several years, Maine has repeatedly acknowledged these federal laws \nand standards, as well as the compelling need to implement a robust system to protect children in \nfoster care from unsafe medication practices.   \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 45 of 71    PageID #: 45\n \n209.  For instance, Maine Citizen’s Review Panel Recommendations for a Coordinated \nHealth Plan for Children in Foster Care told OCFS in as early as 2014 that “[t]he State of Maine, \nin order to be in compliance [with federal law], needs to meet the requirements as stated in the \nFederal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008,” including a \nsystem for “oversight of prescription medicines” that includes an “outline of ‘protocols for the \nappropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications.’” \nC.  Maine Defendants Have Long Acknowledged the Risks Associated with the \nImproper  Administration  and  Inadequate  Oversight  of  Psychotropic \nMedications to Children As Well As Maine’s Own Systemic Failures. \n \ni.  Defendants Fully Understand the Dangers Associated with the Improper \nUse and Oversight of Psychotropic Medications in Children.       \n \n210.  For years, DHHS and OCFS have repeatedly acknowledged their awareness of the \nserious risks accompanying the use of psychotropic medications in foster care populations.  In \ndoing so, they have openly endorsed the same scientific principles discussed above in Section \nV(A). \n211.  For instance, in 2012, several DHHS officials authored a report with the Maine \nIndependent Clinical Information Service detailing the serious harms associated with psychotropic \nmedication administration to children.  It stated that “[s]ide effects can lead to or exacerbate other \nhealth problems.  Children on these drugs are prone to significant weight gain, which can lead to \ndiabetes and other weight-related issues, such as cardiovascular risks.” \n212.  That same year, then-OCFS Director Therese Cahill-Lowe and then-OCFS Medical \nDirector Lindsey Tweed attended the conference entitled “Because Minds Matter: Collaborating \nto Strengthen Management of Psychotropic Medications for Children and Youth in Foster Care.”  \nThis conference taught state agencies the serious risks of harms associated with psychotropic \nmedications, the need for robust oversight mechanisms, and how to reform a state’s oversight \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 46 of 71    PageID #: 46\n \nsystem in order to adequately protect children.  It provided Defendants and other attendees many \ntools to protect foster children from harm.    \n213.  In 2013, the then-OCFS Director gave opening remarks at  a conference that \nexplored  the  trend  of  “skyrocket[ing]”  psychotropic  drug  prescriptions  for  children  and \nadolescents “in spite of the fact that there is an absence of valid research to support the practice.”  \nThe  conference  brochure  explained  that  “[u]nbiased  scientific  research  indicates  that  these \nmedications  have  questionable  effectiveness  and  that  their  use  poses  serious  long-term \nconsequences to developing brains and bodies.” \n214.  In November 2019, OCFS Director Todd Landry and the acting Medical Director \nof OCFS acknowledged that “[p]sychotropic medications alone are often not the best treatment” \nfor foster youth, and that “[t]hey should typically be used with non-pharmacological interventions, \nsuch as behavior interventions and behavioral health therapy, for long-lasting effects.” \n215.  At that time, they expressly admitted that outlier prescription practices of “[t]oo \nmuch,” “[t]oo many,” and “[t]oo young”—as well as “[t]oo long”—are all problematic “[c]oncerns \nin [f]oster [c]are” with respect to psychotropic medications.  OCFS also acknowledged the risks \nof “[m]edical side effect[s] [and] complication[s]” associated with psychotropic medications. \n216.  Substantial numbers of children in DHHS foster care custody continue to be \nprescribed psychotropic medications in the absence of an oversight system that ensures their \nsafety.  Despite their awareness of the risks, Defendants failed to implement an adequate system \nof safeguards and oversight of psychotropic medications to adequately protect Maine foster \nchildren from ongoing substantial risks of serious harm.   \n \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 47 of 71    PageID #: 47\n \nii.  DHHS  and  OCFS  Fully  Understand  That  Their  Own  System  Lacks \nAdequate Safeguards and Oversight Mechanisms to Protect Hundreds of \nMaine Foster Children from Ongoing Substantial Risks of Serious Harm. \n \n217.  Besides  acknowledging  the  substantial  dangers  associated  with  psychotropic \nmedications, supra § V(C)(i), DHHS and OCFS have been made aware of and even expressly \nacknowledged their own system’s failures that expose hundreds of foster children in their custody \nto those substantial dangers.  Nonetheless, DHHS and OCFS have still failed to implement a robust \nsystem of safeguards and oversight of psychotropic medications to adequately protect foster \nchildren. \n218.  As  early  as  2010,  DHHS  and  OCFS’s  then-Medical  Directors  publically \nhighlighted some of Maine’s oversight problems.  They acknowledged that children in Maine \nfoster care are disproportionately prescribed psychotropics, stating that the rate of “foster children \n[] on mental health drugs [is] 3x the rate of non-foster children,” and that as to antipsychotics, it is \neven higher at “4x the rate of usage in non-foster children.”  They also highlighted Maine’s unsafe \npolypharmacy practices, stating that “1 in 10 MaineCare [Medicaid] members [including foster \nchildren] under 19 is on 4 or more mental health medications in the course of a year.”   \n219.  That same year, the Child Welfare Services Maine Ombudsman “brought a serious \nconcern  to  the  Department’s  Divisions  of  Child  Welfare  and  Children’s  Behavioral  Health \nregarding the use of anti-psychotic medication with children and youth in DHHS custody,” and \n“the Department’s [DHHS’s] Medical Directors for child . . . mental health also raised this \nconcern.”  They warned that Maine “still rel[ies] too much on psychiatric medications like anti-\npsychotic drugs” that “have serious long-term side effects, and that state wards are much more \nlikely to be prescribed this medication than other children and youth.” \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 48 of 71    PageID #: 48\n \n220.  In 2011, the following year, the Ombudsman again raised the same concern.  He \nfound that the “use of psychotropic medications for youth in care” child welfare policies and \npractices within DHHS/OCFS required further development.  He classified the “[a]ppropriate use, \nand follow-up of psychotropic medication for youth in care” as challenges for DHHS, and he \nrecommended  that  DHHS/OCFS  reform  their  child  welfare  policies  and  practices  as  to \n“psychotropic medications for youth in care.”   \n221.  Shortly thereafter in 2012, several Maine officials within DHHS authored a report \non medication for children and youth in which they acknowledged that “there may be some overuse \n[of antipsychotic psychotropic medication] that can be reduced” in Maine. \n222.  Also in 2012, a Maine DHHS official shared a 2009 study showing that 37% of \nfoster children in Maine were on mental health drugs compared to only 12.3% of non-foster \nchildren, and that 19.2% of foster children were on four or more mental health drugs compared to \nonly 12% of non-foster children.  As a result of these findings, the official stated that the Drug \nUtilization Review investigated and “found evidence that most prescribers writing for these \nmedications were family practitioners and not providers that have the appropriate education to \nwrite prescriptions for these meds [sic].”  \n223.  Several years later, Maine’s psychotropic oversight issues became the subject of \nnational attention.  In 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services OIG issued a \nreport entitled “Treatment Planning and Medication Monitoring Were Lacking for Children in \nFoster Care Receiving Psychotropic Medication.”  The OIG investigated Maine because it was \none of the worst states nationwide, with one of the five “highest utilization of psychotropic \nmedications in their foster care populations.” \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 49 of 71    PageID #: 49\n \n224.  OIG conducted its review and issued the 2018 OIG Report because “[u]p to 80 \npercent of children enter foster care with significant mental health needs” and may be prescribed \npsychotropic “medications [that] can have serious side effects.”  But even though “ACF suggests \nand the five States [including Maine] in [their] sample require [that psychotropics] [] be used in \nconjunction with treatment planning mechanisms and effective medication monitoring,” there are \nstill “serious quality-of-care concerns in the treatment of children with psychotropic medications.” \n225.  The 2018 OIG Report made clear that DHHS and OCFS’s practices do not pass \nmuster, not even by their own policies.  It concluded that Maine does not fully comply with its \n“own [s]tate requirements for treatment planning and medication monitoring for children in foster \ncare receiving psychotropic medication.” \n226.  For  instance,  although  Maine  has  written  state  requirements  that  foster  care \nmedication plans be reviewed quarterly, the 2018 OIG Report found that “26 percent of children \nin foster care [in Maine] had a medication plan that was not reviewed quarterly by the treatment \nprovider.” \n227.  Although Maine acknowledges the importance of formal treatment planning, the \n2018 OIG Report found that “28 percent of children in [Maine] foster care did not receive a \ntreatment plan.” \n228.  And although Maine acknowledges the importance of medication monitoring, the \n2018 OIG Report found that “11 percent of children in foster care did not receive medication \nmonitoring by a prescribing professional.”    \n229.  In  addition,  although  Maine  Defendants’  policy  requires  the  “caseworker  to \nparticipate in medical or psychiatric appointments where antipsychotic medications are initially \ndiscussed and a determination is made to proceed or not, and then at least every 3 months \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 50 of 71    PageID #: 50\n \nfollowing,” the 2018 OIG report found that a shocking “59 percent of children [prescribed \nantipsychotic medications] did not have a caseworker who participated in initial medical or \npsychiatric appointments and then at least every 3 months following.” \n230.  Besides identifying Defendants’ overt failures to satisfy Maine’s own policies, the \n2018 OIG Report also revealed fundamental problems with the policies themselves.  For instance, \nit found that requirements “did not always include suggested professional practice guidelines \ndesigned to protect [] children.”  As such, the OIG warned that “[i]mproved compliance and \nstrengthened [s]tate requirements are imperative to provide protections for children who are at risk \nfor inappropriate treatment and inappropriate prescribing practices.”  \n231.  After the 2018 OIG Report’s release in September 2018, Defendants expressed \nawareness of the report and Maine’s specific issues highlighted therein.  For instance, in OCFS’s \nDecember 2018 Children’s Behavioral Services Assessment, DHHS and OCFS discussed the \nReport  and  its  findings—admitting  Maine’s  “lack  of  monitoring,”  its  need  to  ensure  that \npsychotropic medications are “appropriately monitored,” and “need for service quality measures”: \nIn September 2018, the United States DHHS Office of Inspector \nGeneral  (OIG)  produced  a  report  concerning  the  medication \nmanagement and treatment of youth entering foster care. This OIG \nreport found that out of the 3,527 children in foster care in Maine, \n1,155  of  them  (32.7  percent)  were  treated  with  psychotropic \nmedications. The report also found that although Maine requires a \ntreatment plan for children in foster care, 28 percent did not have \ntreatment plans. Additionally, the report found that 26 percent of \nmedication plans were not reviewed quarterly as required and that \n11 percent of children in foster care did not receive medication \nmonitoring by a prescribing professional. The lack of monitoring by \na prescribing professional may be a result of the statewide shortage \nof child psychiatrists in Maine. This report highlights the importance \nof  behavioral  health  providers  and  child  welfare  staff  working \ntogether collaboratively to ensure these children receive needed \ntreatment and that medication is appropriately monitored and the \nneed for service quality measures particularly around the use of \npsychotropic medication. \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 51 of 71    PageID #: 51\n \n \n232.  In a news article on the 2018 OIG Report entitled “Few Safeguards Exist for Foster \nKids on Psych Drugs,” the former OCFS Medical Director commented that “[i]t would be great \n[for  Maine]  to  get  more  focus  and  more  resources  on  treatment  planning  and  treatment \nmonitoring.” \n233.  In December 2018, the Public Consulting Group (“PCG”) published an assessment \nof Maine DHHS’s children’s behavioral health services that highlighted the OIG Report and \nMaine’s oversight problems.  PCG stressed the “importance of behavioral health providers and \nchild welfare staff working together collaboratively to ensure these children receive needed \ntreatment and that medication is appropriately monitored and the need for service quality measures \nparticularly around the use of psychotropic medication.”  PCG recognized the OIG Report’s \nrecommendations  that  DHHS  must  implement  greater  oversight  to  protect  children  from \nsubstantial risk of serious harm. \n234.  In late 2019, former OCFS Medical Director Matt Lahaie gave a presentation to the \nMaine Chapter of the AAP concerning “Psychotropic Medication in Maine Foster Youth.”  He, \ntoo, referred to the 2018 OIG Report, which found that Maine has one of the highest rates in the \ncountry of young people in foster care being prescribed psychotropics. \n235.  Despite having known for years of the risks associated with these medications and \nthe large numbers of children in Maine foster care who are prescribed such medications, to this \nday, OCFS continues to fall short of its responsibility for protecting children from harm.  As further \nset forth below, Defendants have not implemented an adequate system of safeguards and oversight \nof psychotropic medications to protect Maine foster children from ongoing substantial risks of \nserious harm.   \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 52 of 71    PageID #: 52\n \nD.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Complete and Current Medical Records for the \nClass and to Provide These Records Promptly to Caregivers.  \n \n236.  The case plan and case review system requirements of the Adoption Assistance and \nChild Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, require child \nwelfare agencies to maintain and share up-to-date medical records as part of a written case plan \nfor each and every child in care. \n237.  The case plan is a written “plan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper \ncare and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster parents in order to . . . address \nthe needs of the child while in foster care.”  By law, that plan must contain “the health . . . records \nof the child, including the most recent information available regarding . . . the names and addresses \nof the child’s health . . . providers, . . . the child’s known medical problems, the child’s medications, \nand any other relevant health . . . information.” \n238.  Additionally, child welfare agencies must have a case review system and procedure \nto ensure their requirements that each “child’s health record . . . is reviewed and updated” and that \n“a copy of the record is supplied to the foster parent or foster provider with whom the child is \nplaced, at the time of each placement of the child in foster care.” \n239.  These requirements reflect the critical need for caregivers to have immediate access \nto a child’s full medical history in order to ensure effective medical and mental health care for \nchildren, including the administration of psychotropic drugs when applicable.    \n240.  Defendants agree with this.  OCFS’s own policy acknowledges the critical role of \nchild and family health information in assessing health status, providing continuity of health care, \navoiding duplication of services, and carrying out the DHHS’s duties and responsibilities toward \nchildren in its custody. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 53 of 71    PageID #: 53\n \n241.  Unfortunately,  however,  DHHS  and  OCFS  fail  to  adequately  maintain  and \ndisseminate to the necessary individuals complete and current medical records including sufficient \ninformation on psychotropic medications. \n242.  Defendants’ written case plans that must contain health records are insufficient, and \nDefendants agree.  In the “Written Case Plan[s]” Item of Maine’s most recent Child & Family \nServices Review (“CFSR”), Maine was labelled as “[n]eeding [i]mprovement.”  In Maine’s 2020-\n2024 Child & Family Services Plan, OCFS and DHHS wrote that “[h]istorically, OCFS has \nrecognized [written case plans] as being a challenge.” \n243.  OCFS has a “Health Records” policy that is deficient and not implemented in \npractice.  Upon information and belief, this policy dates back to 1994 and has been unchanged \nsince 2002—almost two decades—despite recommendations to OCFS in the interim to update its \npolicies to ensure better oversight of psychotropic medications.  For instance, the 2009 Child \nWelfare Services Ombudsman Report “recommend[ed] the further development of policy . . . by \nOCFS, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children in care who are prescribed these high-risk \nmedications.” \n244.  That almost 20-year-old OCFS “Health Records” policy requires that a child’s \nhealth history is “sought prior to any out-of-home placement.”  Certain child health information, \nincluding serious medical conditions, allergies, and medications for chronic and acute conditions, \nmust be provided directly to the foster parent or other child care provider at the time of the child’s \nplacement with them, or to the caseworker responsible for placing the child.  Additional child \nhealth information is to be gathered after the child has entered custody, and the child’s health \nrecord is to be updated. \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 54 of 71    PageID #: 54\n \n245.  The  Child  Welfare  League  of  America  (“CWLA”)  has  promulgated  widely-\naccepted standards that instruct public child welfare agencies to develop “an abbreviated health \nrecord, such as a medical passport, that accompanies the child throughout the child’s stay in out-\nof-home care.”  This critical record is to include, among other things: “[t]he child’s health history \nprior to placement[;] . . . health status immediately before entering care[;] . . . [a]ny medical, dental, \nmental health, or developmental problems[;] . . . [c]urrent medications[;] . . . [and a]llergies. . . . \n[It] should [additionally] prominently identify . . . any medication allergies.”  CWLA standards \nfurther provide that the agency should update this record “in a timely manner, entering information \nabout the child’s health status, services, and needs as soon as [it] becomes available.” \n246.  Similarly, AACAP recommends maintenance of “an ongoing record of diagnoses, \nheight  and  weight,  allergies,  medical  history,  ongoing  medical  problem  list,  psychotropic \nmedications, and adverse medication reactions that are easily available to treating clinicians 24 \nhours a day.”  Review of these records “to assess past successful and unsuccessful treatments can \n. . . reduce the chance that previously ineffective treatments will be used again.” \n247.  OCFS’s written policy requires portable health records for children in DHHS \ncustody.  Among other requirements, the portable health record is supposed to move with the child \nfrom placement to placement and contain an on-going record of medical care sought and received \nwhile the child is in custody.  It is supposed to include medical diagnoses and treatment, psychiatric \nand psychological information, a brief history including traumatic events, an ongoing record of \ncare and psychiatric treatment while in state custody, and medication history, such as the name, \nstrength, dosage, frequency, start date, and stop date.  By policy, this portable health record for \neach child in custody is to be given to foster parents, residential facilities, caseworkers, and other \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 55 of 71    PageID #: 55\n \ncaregivers, and it must be updated by the caseworker every six months and each time the child \nmoves placements.   \n248.  Despite its federal and policy obligations, OCFS fails to promptly prepare and \ndeliver portable health records containing critical information on psychotropic medications at the \ntime a child is placed in their foster home or other placement.   \n249.  Upon information and belief, instead of receiving critical written information about \nthe child’s health and psychotropics upon placement, foster placements often receive only a plastic \nbag filled with drugs.  Too often, they have little idea what to do with them, what side effects to \nlook out for, and how to effectively care for that child’s specific needs.   \n250.  OCFS recently admitted that portable health records do not, in practice, move with \nthe child from placement to placement, and that they are not promptly provided to placements \nwhen the child arrives there.  Although their own policy expressly requires the state to provide a \nportable health record upon foster care placement, OCFS’s 2015 Annual Report to the Legislature \nstated that “[f]oster parents shall request a medical history of [the] child at the time of placement.” \n251.  Even if OCFS were properly maintaining, reviewing, and updating medical records \nor portable health records in practice, they would be of no use if the individuals charged with \ncaring for and, in some cases providing informed consent for medications being given to those \nchildren, do not have ready access to them.  OCFS often fails to provide the required medical \nrecords to foster caregivers, as required by law and policy.  Upon information and belief, foster \ncaregivers are often provided incomplete health records and medication histories for children in \ntheir care, or are provided with no health or medication information at all—such that no essential \npsychotropic medication information arrives with the child or moves from placement to placement.  \nInstead, upon information and belief, foster children often arrive with only a bag of medications. \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 56 of 71    PageID #: 56\n \n252.  Without a system to ensure that foster caregivers are consistently provided with this \ninformation,  caretakers  are  often  left  to  conduct  their  own  research  into  a  child’s  health \ninformation, contacting physicians whose names are on pill bottles, with little guidance as to what \nmedications to administer, when and how to administer them, potential risks and adverse effects, \nand how to respond when a child experiences adverse effects.  Defendants’ failure to maintain \ncomplete and current medical records for the Class and to provide these records to caregivers \nharms children and subjects them to continuing and imminent risk of serious harm. \n253.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  do  not  have  a  quality  assurance \nmechanism or other means of tracking their compliance with their federal obligations. \nE.  Defendants Fail to Assure a Meaningful Informed Consent Process.  \n \n254.  A minimally adequate informed consent process generally requires that a doctor \nprovide full information about the risks and benefits of a particular psychotropic medication before \nexpress  authorization  is  given  by  an  appropriate  adult  consenter  for  the  medication  to  be \nadministered to the child.  \n255.  In a 2012 Information Memorandum, the federal government identified the “need \nfor written policies” with provisions for “[i]nformed and shared decision-making (consent and \nassent) and methods for on-going communication between the prescriber, the child, his/her \ncaregivers, other healthcare workers, [and] the child welfare worker” as an element that is \nconsistently  included  in  guidelines  and  recommendations  for  the  systemic  monitoring  and \noversight of psychotropic medications in the foster care context. \n256.  AACAP standards further clarify that “[a]lthough particularly important at the time \nof  psychotropic  medication  initiation,  informed  consent  and  assent  are  ongoing  processes.  \nInformed consent involves discussion of target symptoms, likely benefits of a potential treatment, \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 57 of 71    PageID #: 57\n \npotential risks of treatment, and risks of not pursuing the treatment in question.  Documentation of \nthe discussion is essential, to provide clear evidence of what occurred.” \n257.  OCFS’s own policy acknowledges the importance of the informed consent process \nin delivering and assuring safe and appropriate care to children, stating that: \nAll  clients,  including  children  and  youth,  have  the  right  to \nparticipate in all service decisions, review their treatment, case or \nservice plan, refuse any service unless mandated by law or court \norder  and  be  informed  about  the  consequences  of  refusal  or \ndisengagement with services. The client of mental health services \nshould be provided with a copy of the Rights of Recipients of Mental \nHealth Services published by DHHS. Clients must be informed of \ntheir right to choice in the selection of a service provider qualified \nto meet the assessed service or treatment need. Services are to be \nprovided to meet the assessed need and should not go beyond the \nscope of that need unless requested by the client. The client is to be \ninformed  prior  to  any  engagement  in  services  of  their  rights \nregarding confidentiality and privacy protections by the provider. \nDHHS staff must comply with the DHHS confidentiality policy. \n \n258.  OCFS has not promulgated a policy setting forth the informed consent process or \nprocedures for all classes of psychotropic medications.  Rather, OCFS has promulgated an \ninformed consent policy only with respect to the class of antipsychotic medications, and that policy \nis wholly insufficient—even as to antipsychotics. \n259.  That OCFS policy, titled “Use of Antipsychotic Medications for Youth in Foster \nCare,” provides that absent certain emergency or urgent circumstances, youth over 14 can only be \nprescribed medication that they, their caretaker and their prescriber all consent to, but is silent as \nto who must provide consent for youth under 14.  The policy includes an Antipsychotic Medication \nConsent Worksheet, which states that youth under 14 should assent to use of medication, and \nwhich, upon information and belief, is not consistently employed.  The child’s “caseworker is \nrequired to be present in person or by phone at the appointment with the prescriber at the first \nappointment and every three months following or as requested by the caregiver or provider to \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 58 of 71    PageID #: 58\n \nattend.”  “Prior to any consideration of medication to address a child’s mental health needs[,] the \ntreating provider must be given a full description of the circumstances of the child that follows a \nCasework Review.” \n260.  OCFS’s existing informed consent policy on antipsychotics is deficient on its face \nin at least the following ways: \ni.  The  policy  addresses  informed  consent  only  for  the  administration  of \nantipsychotics, rather than for all psychotropic medications. \nii.  The policy does not provide for the involvement of a child’s biological parent(s) \nin the informed consent process, even if the biological parents’ rights have not \nbeen terminated. \niii.  The  policy  does  not  include  a  process  to  resolve  disagreements  among \ncaregivers, parents, caseworkers or providers over whether a medication should \nbe administered. \niv.  The policy lacks a complete list of the factors that should be considered before \nmaking a decision. \nv.  The policy does not adequately give a timeline for continuing, changing, and \ndiscontinuing prescriptions. \nvi.  The policy does not provide for a uniform system for tracking informed consent \nand assent both at an individual-case and aggregate level to facilitate oversight. \nvii.  The policy does not provide for or require any periodic review of the initial \nconsent nor set forth factors that require a reconsideration of initial consent, \nwhich may result in foster children continuing on a regimen of medications for \nmonths or years without review. \nviii.  The  policy  lacks  a  detailed  process  for  informed  consent  in  emergency \nsituations. \nix.  It is unclear who is required to complete the Antipsychotic Medication Consent \nWorksheet and where it must be stored, if at all. \n \n261.  This lack of a streamlined process to evaluate a refusal to consent or assent to the \nadministration of psychotropic medications without a meaningful opportunity to be heard can \nresult in a child being unwillingly subjected to medications with potentially serious side effects. \n262.  Because the OCFS policy for Use of Antipsychotic Medications for Youth in Foster \nCare is so limited and ambiguous, it is often either misapplied, misunderstood, or entirely \noverlooked by caseworkers and caregivers in securing informed consent for children in DHHS \ncustody. \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 59 of 71    PageID #: 59\n \n263.  For instance, although Maine’s antipsychotic policy requires caseworkers to attend \nappointments with prescribers where antipsychotics are discussed, it does not specify whether the \ncaseworkers must attend appointments where other classes of psychotropics are discussed, and it \ndoes not specify whether and how the caseworkers should be involved in the informed consent \ndecision-making process at any such appointments.   \n264.  Although their attendance is required by this policy, in practice, caseworkers are \nnot routinely present at these meetings or involved in these consent conversations.  Tellingly, 59% \nof a sample of 39 Maine foster children prescribed antipsychotics did not have a caseworker who \nparticipated in initial medical or psychiatric appointments and then at least every 3 months \nfollowing. \n265.  Maine’s antipsychotic policy also neglects to involve a child’s biological parent(s) \nin the informed consent process, even if the parents’ rights have not been terminated.  For instance, \nthe antipsychotic policy does not require that biological parents receive notice when a healthcare \nprovider recommends the prescription of a new psychotropic medication to the child.  Likewise, \nthe policy does not require that other appropriate adults, such as a child’s guardian ad litem or \ncourt-appointed special advocate, be notified of informed consent requests.  Nor is there a process \nset forth in the policy for resolving disagreements between caregivers, parents, caseworkers, or \nproviders over whether the child should receive psychotropic medication.  And there is no process \nin  the  policy  by  which  an  alternative  adult  may  seek  to  serve  as  the  child’s  consenting \nauthority.  Consequently, the lack of involvement of appropriate adults in the informed consent \nprocess can subject foster children to the administration of psychotropic medications without \nadequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 60 of 71    PageID #: 60\n \n266.  Similarly, although informed consent is an ongoing process, Maine’s policy does \nnot expressly provide a timeline for continuing, changing, and discontinuing prescriptions, or for \nthe expiration of informed consent and assent.  The 2018 OIG Report found that in a sample of \n120 Maine foster children prescribed psychotropic medications, approximately 26% did not have \ntheir medication plan reviewed quarterly by the treatment provider, and approximately 11% did \nnot receive any medication monitoring by a prescribing professional.  These numbers indicate that \na significant percentage of Maine foster children on psychotropics thus did not have a proper \nongoing informed consent and assent process under the AACAP standards. \n267.  Despite  the  critical  importance  of  obtaining  proper  informed  consent,  upon \ninformation and belief, OCFS has no system to track compliance with the agency’s informed \nconsent policy across all children in care, betraying the widely recognized principle that “you \ncannot manage what you cannot measure.” \n268.  Specifically, OCFS has no system for tracking in the aggregate whether (a) the \nchild’s  parents  are  engaged  in  medical  decision-making  when  available,  (b)  the  assigned \ncaseworker is notified by the resource parents before they administer medication to a child for \nwhich the resource parents provided informed consent to the prescriber, (c) youth are given the \nopportunity for informed assent before going on a psychotropic medication regimen, or (d) when \nmedication is refused, whether the appropriate procedures are followed and documented before \nOCFS overrides this refusal.  Absent this aggregate data, OCFS is unable to identify and timely \ncorrect areas of non-compliance with this important policy, leaving children at risk. \n269.  Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive and up-to-date medical records for all \nchildren in care makes it likely that medications may be approved without the benefit of knowing \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 61 of 71    PageID #: 61\n \na child’s health history, which could include allergies to medication, documented adverse effects \nto medications, or failed previous attempts with that very same drug.   \n270.  This risk is exacerbated by Maine’s scarcity of prescribers with a scarcity of time \nto devote to each child.  In December 2018, the PCG report concluded that “there is a severe \nshortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists in Maine.”  As such, Maine foster children are often \nprescribed psychotropic medications by others, such as pediatricians or nurse practitioners. \n271.  In the absence of an effective informed consent process, OCFS has failed to \ninstitute any other procedures to ensure that informed consent is obtained for the administration of \npsychotropic medications to children in custody. \n272.  Further, DHHS and OCFS’s policies and practices further fail to ensure that the \nadult providing informed consent is appropriately positioned to exercise informed, objective \njudgment in the best interest of the child.   \n273.  For instance, although the antipsychotic informed consent policy requires that the \ntreating provider must be given a full description of the circumstances of the child that follows a \nCasework Review prior to any medication administration, caseworkers who could have access to \nthis information routinely do not attend these medication administration appointments, supra ¶¶ \n263-64, and foster parents routinely do not receive vital information about their child’s health and \nmedication history and adverse reactions, supra ¶¶ 236-52.  Further, Maine’s antipsychotic policy \ndoes not provide for the involvement of biological parents, guardians ad litem, court-appointed \nspecial advocates, or other appropriate adults in the informed consent process, and it does not set \nforth  a  process  for  resolving  disagreements  regarding  whether  the  child  should  receive \npsychotropic medications.  DHHS and OCFS fail to provide foster children with a sufficient \nprocess for obtaining initial and ongoing informed consent, including adequate notice and a \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 62 of 71    PageID #: 62\n \nmeaningful opportunity to be heard prior to and throughout the time that children in foster care are \nadministered psychotropic medications. \nF.  Defendants  Fail  to  Operate  a  Monitoring  and  Oversight  System  That \nPromptly  Flags  Outlier  Prescriptions  and  Subjects  Them  to  Secondary \nReview.  \n \n274.  Absent access to comprehensive medical records and effective informed consent, \nprocedures to  ensure  that outlier prescription  practices  are  timely  identified  and  subjected \nto secondary review are particularly critical.  The 2015 AACAP recommendations, as well as \nguidance from ACF and professional organizations, call for collaboration between child welfare \nagencies,  Medicaid  agencies,  and  mental  health  agencies  to  effectively  monitor  the  safe \nadministration of psychotropic medication to children in foster care.  In particular, AACAP calls \nfor the systemic capacity to identify “red flag criteria triggering external reviews,” and for \n“[m]andatory consultations with an identified child and adolescent reviewer” in response to \nidentified  red  flags.   ACF  guidance  similarly  calls  for  systems  designed  to  flag  outlier \nprescriptions,  including  “instances  where  children  are  prescribed  too  many  psychotropic \nmedications, too much medication, or at too young an age:  too many, and too much, too young.” \n275.  OCFS  currently  fails  to  operate  a  monitoring  and  oversight  system \nthat adequately flags outlier prescriptions of psychotropic medications to children in its custody \nand subjects these prescriptions to a secondary review. \n276.  A sizeable number of states, including several New England states, have established \nand published red flag criteria which trigger mandatory secondary reviews of designated outlier \nprescriptions.  Maine has not developed such red flag criteria, thereby failing to meet the minimal \nstandard of care in the field. \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 63 of 71    PageID #: 63\n \n277.  Additionally, Maine has failed to implement a secondary review system that utilizes \nchild  psychiatrists  to  undertake  the  secondary  reviews.   In  its  “Practice  Parameters  for  the \nAssessment and Management of Youth Involved with the Child Welfare System,” AACAP \nstresses the unique, “important role” child and adolescent psychiatrists play in psychotropic \nmedication oversight.   The use of child psychiatrists is vital, as they possess the requisite training \nand experience to conduct meaningful secondary reviews.  Oftentimes, the initial prescription to \nbe subjected to a secondary review was written by a pediatrician or nurse practitioner who does \nnot possess sufficient knowledge to assure safe practice vis-à-vis psychotropic medications for \nyouth in foster care.  AACAP specifically instructs child welfare agencies to “establish[] programs \nadministered by child psychiatrists to oversee and evaluate the use of medications for youth in \nstate custody at the individual youth and population levels.” \n278.  Furthermore, in December 2020, DHHS and OCFS identified the elimination of “a \ngroup of staff dedicated to children’s behavioral health quality assurance” as a “significant barrier \nto the goal of increasing the use of evidence-based models and evidence-informed interventions,” \nand acknowledged that there is now “limited monitoring of the quality of [behavioral health] \nservices delivered or their fidelity to evidence-based models.” \n279.  Defendants’ failure to institute a comprehensive secondary review system places \nfoster children at risk of remaining on inappropriate psychotropic medication regimens for months, \nor even years, without a proper review by a qualified medical professional. \n \n \n \n \n \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 64 of 71    PageID #: 64\n \nVI. CAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ SUBSTANTIVE DUE \nPROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class                                        \nand against all Defendants) \n \n280.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n281.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it takes that child \ninto its foster care custody. \n282.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute a failure to meet their affirmative duty to protect the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm.  These failures are a substantial factor leading to, and proximate \ncause of, the ongoing violation of the class members’ constitutionally-protected fundamental \nliberty  interests  conferred  upon  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n283.  Defendants are well aware of the policies and practices that constitute a failure to \nprotect the Class from an unreasonable risk of harm. \n284.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that are contrary to law and are substantial \ndepartures from any accepted professional judgment such that they are outside of that judgment. \nDefendants’ actions and inactions are also in deliberate indifference to their awareness of facts \nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists for Named \nPlaintiffs and the Class.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Named Plaintiffs and \nthe Class have been harmed or are at continuing and imminent risk of serious harm, and have been \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 65 of 71    PageID #: 65\n \ndeprived of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n285.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right to \nprotection from harm or unreasonable risk of harm while in state foster care custody; the right to \nnecessary treatment, care, and services to protect class members from deteriorating or being \nharmed physically, psychologically, developmentally, or otherwise while in state foster care; and \nthe right to adequate supervision and monitoring of class members’ health and safety. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ PROCEDURAL DUE \nPROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class \nand against all Defendants) \n \n286.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n287.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution prohibits Defendants from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law. \n288.  Foster children have a substantial liberty interest, protected by the Due Process \nClause, in being free from the unnecessary administration of medical treatment, including the \nunnecessary administration of psychotropic medication. \n289.  Defendants have a compelling interest in the protection of minor children. \n290.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that deprive the Plaintiff Children and class \nmembers of this liberty interest without due process of law. \n291.  Defendants’ actions and inactions have interfered with the Named Plaintiffs and \nclass members’ liberty interest. \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 66 of 71    PageID #: 66\n \n292.  Defendants’ actions and inactions subject the Named Plaintiffs and class members \nto the unnecessary administration of psychotropic medication without having sufficient procedures \nfor ensuring that these medications are appropriately administered to the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass. \n293.  Defendants’ actions and inactions fail to provide the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \na sufficient process for informed consent, including adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity \nto be heard, prior to and throughout the time that children in foster care are administered any \npsychotropic medications. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS UNDER THE \nFEDERAL ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AND CHILD WELFARE ACT (“AACWA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq.  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class                                        \nand against all Defendants) \n \n294.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n295.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that violate the statutory rights of the \nPlaintiff Children and class members under the federal statute AACWA, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq., and the regulations \npromulgated under the Act, 45 C.F.R. Parts 1355-1357. \n296.  These rights include, but are not limited to, the rights of the Plaintiff Children and \nclass members to:  (a) have their own individualized “written” case plan “for assuring that the child \nreceives safe and proper care and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster parents \nin order to . . . address the needs of the child while in foster care” that contain, inter alia, the health \nrecords of the child, which must “includ[e] the most recent information available regarding” the \nnames and addresses of the child’s health providers, a record of the child’s immunizations, the \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 1   Filed 01/06/21   Page 67 of 71    PageID #: 67\n \nchild’s  known  medical  problems,  the  child’s  medications,  and  any  other  relevant  health \ninformation concerning the child determined to be appropriate by the State agency; and (b) have \nhis or health records reviewed, updated, and supplied to the foster parent or foster care providers \nwith whom the child is placed before or at the time of placement.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(8)(A)(ii), \n671(a)(16), 675(1), 675(5). \n297.  These rights created by AACWA are clearly and expressly intended to benefit the \nPlaintiff Children and class members, the rights are specific and concrete requirements that are \nneither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence, and the statutory provisions noted \nabove impose a mandatory, binding obligation on the states to fulfill these requirements. \nVII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \n298.  WHEREFORE,  the  Named  Plaintiffs,  on  behalf  of  the  putative  Class  they \nrepresent, respectfully request that this Court exercise its legal and equitable powers and award \nclass-wide relief as follows: \na.

The State of Maine, through its duly appointed state officials, has an affirmative \nduty under the United States Constitution to keep safe over 2,000 children in foster care placed \ninto its custody and care due to substantiated abuse or neglect.  Oftentimes, these children are \ngiven  powerful  psychotropic  medications  while  in  state  custody  to  address  mental  health \nconditions or simply to control their behavior.  However, there is a profound “gap” between what \nMaine “believe[s] to be important to keep children safe when using [] powerful [psychotropic] \ndrugs, and what is  actually happening.”   According to the Assistant Inspector General for \nEvaluations and Inspections at the federal Department of Health and Human Services, what is \nactually happening is that “children in the [Maine] foster care system [] aren’t getting the \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 2 of 73    PageID #: 443\nsafeguards they need to protect them from inappropriate care” with respect to the administration \nof psychotropic medications.    \n2.  Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs that impact emotions and behavior, \nsuch as anti-anxiety agents, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and antipsychotics. \nThese  medications  are  particularly  potent  to  children.    Alas,  any  child  administered  these \nmedications faces a heightened risk of life-threatening physical and emotional harms at a greater \nfrequency and at a greater severity.  These harms include seizures, psychosis, suicidal thoughts, \nself-harm, weight gain, lack of mental clarity, excessive fatigue, aggression, mental health crises, \ninvoluntary movements, diabetes, cardiovascular events, organ damage, and even sudden death. \n3.  Foster children are particularly vulnerable to these serious harms associated with \npsychotropic  medications.    The  U.S.  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  Office  of \nInspector General (“OIG”) informed the public that “[u]p to 80 percent of children in foster care \nenter State custody with significant mental health needs.  Unlike children from intact families, \nchildren in foster care often do not have a consistent interested party to coordinate treatment \nplanning  or  to  provide  continuous  oversight  of  their  mental  health  treatment.    Further, \nresponsibility for children in foster care is shared among multiple people—foster parents, birth \nparents, and caseworkers—which creates risk of miscommunication, conflict, and lack of follow-\nup.  Children in foster care may also experience multiple changes in placement and in physicians, \nwhich can cause health information about these children to be incomplete and spread across many \nsources.  Therefore, children in foster care may be at risk for inappropriate prescribing practices \n(e.g., too many medications, incorrect dosage, incorrect duration, incorrect indications for use, or \ninappropriate treatment).” \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 3 of 73    PageID #: 444\n4.  For about a decade, Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) \nand Office of Child and Family Services (“OCFS”) have openly acknowledged the serious risks \nassociated with psychotropic medication administered to foster children as well as their duty to \nmaintain robust protections to protect Maine foster children against these dangers.  Unfortunately, \nhowever, Maine has never created an adequate system to protect foster children in its care.  Instead, \nDHHS and OCFS acknowledged their own system’s failures.  The same systemic failures have \npersisted for years as the State has continued to receive scrutiny.  For instance, in late 2018, Maine \nwas criticized by the federal Department of Health and Human Services OIG for having one of the \nworst systems in  the  nation with respect  to its oversight  and management  of  psychotropic \nmedications for foster children. \n5.  Maine DHHS and OCFS continue to permit hundreds of foster children to be \nadministered  one  or  more  dangerous  psychotropic  drugs  without  ensuring  the  provision  of \nsufficient oversight mechanisms critical for their safety, knowingly exposing vulnerable children \nin their care to life-threatening risks.  Maine’s most pronounced and harmful oversight failures \ninclude the following: \na.  Inadequate Medical Records:  Maine fails to maintain readily accessible, \ncomprehensive, and up-to-date medical records for children in its custody.  It \nfurther fails to provide these records to all foster caregivers promptly upon the \nplacement of a child in their care or to all prescribing physicians for purposes \nof treatment.  Without maintaining and promptly providing such critical records \nthat detail the child’s physical and mental health history, including current and \nprior medications and observed side effects, DHHS and OCFS fail to facilitate \nfully informed, safe, and well-coordinated treatment for its foster children.   \n \nb.  Inadequate  Informed  Consent:  Maine  fails  to  maintain  and  enforce  a \nminimally adequate informed consent process, whereby a clearly designated \nadult  consents  to  the  administration  of  any  recommended  psychotropic \nmedication to a child only after receiving complete information, both prior to \nand throughout the administration of the medications, assessing the intended \nbenefits and potential risks associated with the drugs. \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 4 of 73    PageID #: 445\nc.  Inadequate Secondary Review:  Maine fails to maintain and operate an \nappropriate system to sufficiently ensure that all especially dangerous and \noutlier  prescriptions  of  psychotropic  medications  to  children—such  as \npotentially life-threatening combinations of psychotropic drugs administered \nconcomitantly to a child—are immediately flagged for purposes of conducting \na secondary review through a qualified child psychiatrist to assure safety.   \n \n6.  As a result of these failures, hundreds of preschoolers through teens in Maine’s \nfoster care system remain at an unreasonable risk of serious harm with each passing day.  They \ntake heavy cocktails of psychotropic medications that can, and do, lead to serious, life-altering \nphysical and psychological harms—without proper structures in place by Defendants to identify \nand guard against these harms.  \n7.  This litigation seeks solely injunctive relief to remedy these systemic failures and \nto protect these vulnerable Maine foster children. \n8.  Named Plaintiffs Bryan C., Henry B., Trent W., Grayson M., Kendall P., and \nNeville H. bring this class action on behalf of a putative class of Maine foster children who are or \nwill be administered psychotropic medications in the State’s custody and, hence, are subjected to \na substantial risk of serious harm through the State’s oversight failures.  The Named Plaintiffs \nname Jeanne M. Lambrew, Ph.D., Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human \nServices, and Todd A. Landry, Ed.D., Director of the Maine Office of Child and Family Services, \nas Defendants in their official capacities only.   \nII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE  \n9.  This action is brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to redress violations of the \nUnited States Constitution and federal statutory law.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1343(a)(3), and authority to grant declaratory relief under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 \nand 2202 and Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 5 of 73    PageID #: 446\n10.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  District  pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(b)  because  a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District.  Venue \nis proper in this Division because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to these \nclaims occurred in Kennebec and Cumberland counties.  Named Plaintiffs Bryan C. and Neville \nH. currently reside in Cumberland County.  Named Plaintiff Henry B. currently resides in \nKennebec County. \nIII. PARTIES \nA.  The Named Plaintiffs   \ni.  Bryan C. \n11.  Bryan C.1 is a 7-year-old boy.  He was drug-exposed at birth and subjected to \nneglect,  emotional  abuse,  and  physical  abuse  throughout  his  early  childhood.   Bryan  C.’s \nbiological mother struggled with drug addiction.  At age 5, he was involved in a serious car \naccident while his mother was driving under the influence.  He was hospitalized for his injuries, \nremoved from his biological home in Hiram, Maine, and placed into foster care custody.   \n12.  In the brief two years since being placed into foster care, Bryan C. has cycled \nthrough multiple settings across the state.  Bryan C. has moved between a kinship placement with \nhis maternal aunt, crisis placements, and psychiatric hospitals and treatment facilities throughout \nthe state, such as in Aroostook County, over five hours away from his biological family.  In July \n2020, he was placed in a residential treatment facility in Bridgton, Maine, and he remains there \ntoday. \n13.  While in state custody, Bryan C.’s psychotropic medications have included at least \nthe following: (1) Risperidone (an antipsychotic); (2) Clonidine (an alpha agonist); (3) Vyvanse (a \n                                                            \n1 All Named Plaintiff first names and last initials listed in this Complaint consist of pseudonyms to protect the identities \nof the Named Plaintiff children.  A corresponding motion to use pseudonyms is filed herewith. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 6 of 73    PageID #: 447\nstimulant); (4) Aripiprazole (Abilify, another antipsychotic); (5) Methylphenidate (Ritalin, a \nstimulant); (6) Adderall (another stimulant), and (7) Sertraline (Zoloft, an antidepressant).  He has \nalso frequently been administered Melatonin. \n14.  Bryan  C.  has  been  repeatedly  subjected  to  polypharmacy  of  psychotropic \nmedications throughout his time in state custody.   \n15.  He  has  been  administered  at  least  four  different  psychotropic  medications \nconcurrently while in state care.  For example, he is currently being administered a cocktail of \nVyvanse, Risperidone, Clonidine, and Zoloft in addition to Melatonin.   \n16.  Bryan C. has been reportedly subjected to inappropriate dosages of medications for \na child of his age and size.  When Bryan C. was hospitalized following a crisis, a doctor reviewing \nhis medical history found the administration of Vyvanse to Bryan C. to be entirely inappropriate \nin terms of the medication itself and the dosage level.  Upon information and belief, no red flag or \nsecondary review process has been triggered by this prescribing practice.     \n17.  Bryan  C.  has  experienced  a  litany  of  harms  and  adverse  effects  from  these \npsychotropic medications.   \n18.  In  August  2019  at  age  6,  Bryan  C.’s  medication  regime  was  changed  to \nRisperidone, Vyvanse, and Melatonin.  In late August 2019, he experienced increased aggression \nand irritability.  Bryan C. also experienced his first of many suicidal ideations and threats.  He \nthreatened to kill himself with a toy gun.  He was subsequently hospitalized in Bangor, Maine.   \n19.  Bryan C. began to inflict self-harm.  For instance, at school, he would repeatedly \nbang his head against the wall.  By early 2020, a typical day at school for him consisted of violent \nbehavior toward himself and others, as well as multiple suicidal statements.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 7 of 73    PageID #: 448\n20.  Bryan C.’s caregiver reported as early as June 2019 that his ADHD medications \nmade him withdrawn, anxious, and irritable.   \n21.  He experienced weight gain.  At age 6, he reportedly gained approximately 25 \npounds while taking Risperidone without any discernable benefit.  OCFS has expressed awareness \nof this weight gain.  \n22.  At one point, Bryan C. developed a tic in his eye.     \n23.  Bryan  C.  experienced  excessive  fatigue,  excessive  sleeping,  and  other  sleep \ndisturbances. While in his one-on-one learning environment in early 2020, he would constantly \nfall asleep in class, often laying sound asleep on a couch in his classroom.  This fatigue, in addition \nto his frequent hospital and crisis stabilization unit stays, has significantly disrupted his learning \nand development.  In spring 2020, at age 7, he reportedly could not write his own name.  \n24.  Bryan C. has reportedly experienced excessive thirst and excessive urination while \ntaking psychotropic medications, which can be suggestive of diabetes.  His A1C levels, a critical \nmarker for diabetes, were once belatedly tested months ago but not followed up on.  Upon recent \nrequest for the results of this test, the child’s OCFS caseworker, case manager, and residential \ntreatment placement were all unable to produce the relevant records.  OCFS instead directed the \nplacement to reach out to the local hospital directly to try to obtain the records themselves.  As of \nthis writing, his A1C results continue to remain unknown to Bryan C.’s guardian ad litem and, \nupon information and belief, his OCFS caseworker. \n25.  While receiving psychotropic medications, Bryan C. has experienced an inability \nto focus and a lack of mental clarity.  In the child’s own words, his “brain doesn’t work.  [He] \ncan’t feel [his] brain.”   \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 8 of 73    PageID #: 449\n26.  More  psychotropic  medication  became  the  answer  to  problems  caused  by \npsychotropic medications.  Bryan C. was often prescribed new psychotropic medications to treat \nside effects of other psychotropic medications.  For instance, after he was first prescribed Vyvanse \nin approximately April 2019 at age 6, he experienced irritability and aggression.  A few months \nlater, in early August, his aunt informed his OCFS caseworker and Next Friend that Risperidone \nwas added on top of his existing Vyvanse due to his aggressive behaviors.  He has more recently \nbeen administered Zoloft “to try [to] settle him down at night,” and he has regularly been \nprescribed Melatonin to help him sleep. \n27.  When he was 6 years old, a hospital monitored him for 5 days without medications, \nswitched  his  medications  to  Abilify  and  Adderall,  and  expressly  directed  that  his  prior \nprescriptions of Vyvanse, Melatonin, and Risperidone all be discontinued.  But just weeks later, \nhis prior prescriber reinstated his use of Vyvanse, and his use of Risperidone was also reinstated \nshortly thereafter.  Bryan C. again fared poorly on the old medication regime, and again ended up \nin a crisis stabilization unit. \n28.  At the time of and since these medications’ prescription, Defendants have not \ncommunicated or implemented an effective informed consent process through which an objective \ndecision-maker can consent to medication for Bryan C. after receiving full information about a \npotential  medication’s  risks,  benefits,  and  alternative  treatments,  nor  has  there  been  any \ncommunicated process by which one can object to medications.   \n29.  Upon information and belief, Bryan C.’s caseworkers are not typically present at or \ninvolved in appointments with prescribers when potential psychotropic medications are discussed \nor prescribed.  At times, upon information and belief, they were notified of medication changes \nafter the fact, rather than playing a necessary role in the medication discussion to ensure that the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 9 of 73    PageID #: 450\nchild is safe and that meaningful informed consent is fully obtained.  For instance, when his \nresidential treatment facility added a fourth psychotropic medication, Zoloft, to Bryan C.’s cocktail \nof psychotropic medications, his OCFS caseworker was notified of the medication change only \nafter Bryan C. had begun the medication. \n30.  Defendants have not promptly provided Bryan C., his caregivers, his advocates, or \nhis prescribing physicians a comprehensive, up-to-date medical record that would contain his \nmedical information and psychotropic medications, such as adverse effects and instructions for \ncurrent medications, or warnings about prior unsuccessful medications.  \n31.  For instance, no medical passport listing his medical history and psychotropic \nmedications has moved with the child from placement to placement. \n32.  Bryan C.’s health record is poorly maintained by Defendants such that Bryan C.’s \ncaretakers, clinicians, advocates, and even Defendants’ caseworkers do not have ready access to \nhis prior and current medication regimes at any given time.  This has harmed Bryan C. on more \nthan one occasion. \n33.  For  instance,  when  Bryan  C.  first  entered  care  at  age  5,  he  suffered  an \napproximately 3 month gap when no caseworker had clear and comprehensive responsibility for, \nor access to, Bryan C.’s medical file containing his critical health information, and, hence, could \nnot adequately monitor him or his medications.  During those three months, no OCFS caseworker \ntook responsibility for his file or his case, such that no one at OCFS was maintaining and promptly \nupdating the file during that period.   \n34.  Even worse, in early March 2020, Bryan C. landed in the emergency room for a \ncrisis evaluation due to suicidal threats and aggression, and shortly thereafter was transferred to a \ncrisis stabilization unit several hours away in Rockport, Maine.  The clinician there expressed \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 10 of 73    PageID #:\n451\nconcerns that Bryan C.’s medications may need to be changed, since they were seeing many of the \nsame problematic behaviors.  However, Defendants did not provide the unit’s clinicians with a list \nof current and prior medications for the child.  When the clinician reached out to his OCFS \ncaseworker to request it, the caseworker failed to respond to the request and provided no such \ninformation.  As a result, Bryan C. suffered a one-month period during which the clinicians in \ncharge of treating the acute crisis Bryan C. experienced could not access his basic psychotropic \nmedication records needed to sufficiently treat or monitor him.  After the OCFS caseworker finally \ncontacted them, the caseworker reported that they did not have ready access to the information and \ntherefore could not provide the information.  Instead, the caseworker directed Bryan C.’s aunt to \ncontact Bryan C.’s previous psychiatrist to try to learn information about his medications.  \n35.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Bryan C.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n36.  Bryan C. remains in Defendants’ custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \n37.  Bryan C.’s case is brought by his adult Next Friend Mr. Michael P. Dixon. \nii.  Henry B. \n38.  Henry B. is a 15-year-old boy who is currently in foster care custody.  Henry B.’s \ncase is brought by his adult Next Friend Michael P. Dixon. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 11 of 73    PageID #:\n452\n39.  Henry B. currently resides in Belgrade, Maine in a respite foster home, where he \nhas been for the past several months.  He entered foster care custody from Bridgton, Maine as a \nresult of neglect in July 2018.  Over the last two and a half years that he has been in Maine foster \ncare, Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for his safety and well-being as to how \npsychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n40.  Henry B. has received several psychotropic medications throughout his time in state \ncustody.   \n41.  Henry B.’s current cocktail of medications consists of the following psychotropic \nmedications:  (1) Venlafaxine (an antidepressant); (2) Trazodone (an antidepressant); (3) Clonidine \n(an alpha agonist); (4) Guanfacine (an alpha agonist); and (5) Concerta (a stimulant).   \n42.  Henry B. has received up to six different psychotropic medications at once while \nin state custody.  For instance, Henry B.’s cocktail of psychotropic medications earlier this year \nconsisted  of:    (1)  Bupropion  (Wellbutrin,  an  antidepressant);  (2)  Sertraline  (Zoloft,  an \nantidepressant);  (3)  Trazodone  (an  antidepressant);  (4)  Clonidine  (an  alpha  agonist);  (5) \nGuanfacine (an alpha agonist); and (6) Concerta (a stimulant).   \n43.  To Henry B. and his Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has \nbeen triggered by this polypharmacy.  \n44.  Henry  B.  has  experienced  numerous  adverse  effects  as  a  result  of  these \npsychotropic medications.  \n45.  Henry B. has experienced rapid blinking and a twitch in one eye. \n46.  He has experienced brain fog as well as difficulty processing information. \n47.  While taking psychotropic medications, he has experienced increased aggression, \nsexualized behaviors, and mental health crises.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 12 of 73    PageID #:\n453\n48.  At the time of the prescription and continued administration of his psychotropic \nmedications, Henry B. and his caregivers were not adequately and consistently informed about the \nrisks,  potential  consequences,  and  alternatives  to  these  medications.    Defendants  did  not \ncommunicate an effective informed consent or assent process through which Henry B. or his \ncaregivers could object to taking medications.   \n49.  Henry  B.  has  not  been  regularly  included  in  meaningful  informed  consent \nconversations about the administration of new or ongoing psychotropic medications, even after he \nturned 14.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have never informed Henry B. that he is able \nto have a meaningful role in the decision-making process.   \n50.  He does not currently understand which psychotropic medications he is on, why he \nis taking them, and what their alternatives are.  Henry B. does not even seem to understand that \nthese psychotropic medications have side effects that could affect him.  \n51.  Over the past two and a half years, Henry B. has had 5 different OCFS caseworkers \nwith minimal involvement in his psychotropic medication decision-making or administration.   \n52.  Henry B. and his caregivers have not received a portable record of critical health \ninformation pertaining to his mental health and psychotropic medications.  \n53.  OCFS has so poorly maintained his mental health records that it is unclear, for \ninstance,  what  Henry  B.’s  mental  health  diagnoses  even  are.    A  comprehensive,  adequate \npsychological evaluation was never performed for this child after entering care.  When Henry B.’s \nnew caseworker asked what his diagnoses were at a recent transition meeting with OCFS and \nothers, no one present from OCFS could answer this question.  When the new caseworker asked \nfor a copy of Henry B.’s initial evaluation—which would contain at least his initial diagnoses, his \ncurrent case manager reported that they did not have a copy of this document. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 13 of 73    PageID #:\n454\n54.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Henry B.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n55.  Henry B. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \niii.  Trent W. \n56.  Trent W. is a 9-year-old boy currently in foster care custody.  Trent W.’s case is \nbrought by his adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n57.  Trent W. now resides in a therapeutic foster home in Sydney, Maine.  He entered \nstate custody in January 2020, as a result of extreme neglect.  \n58.  Trent W. spent his first five to six weeks in state custody “hotelled,” that is, cycling \nbetween spending days at a time residing at a hotel supervised by an OCFS caseworker, leaving \nthe hotel to spend days at a “respite” foster home, and then returning to a hotel stay.  During this \ntime,  a  caseworker  provided  Trent  W.  with  an  ADHD  psychotropic  medication,  despite \nDefendants being in possession of medical records that ruled out a diagnosis of ADHD for Trent \nW.  Defendants failed to provide accurate, current medical records or a medical passport to Trent \nW.’s caregivers and prescriber, and Defendants failed to ensure that meaningful informed consent \nwas provided for this medication. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 14 of 73    PageID #:\n455\n59.  In February 2020, Trent W. was seen by a primary care physician for his initial \nevaluation, a “pediatric rapid evaluation.”  The records from that appointment noted that he “has \nbeen diagnosed with ADHD,” for which he took psychotropic medication.  \n60.  That diagnosis was wrong.  In fact, a 2018 psychological evaluation of Trent W. by \na psychologist had specifically ruled out a diagnosis of ADHD.  Defendants were in possession of \nthat 2018 psychological evaluation at the time of the February 2020 pediatric rapid evaluation, but \nDefendants failed to provide it to the primary care physician conducting that pediatric rapid \nevaluation.    Because  the  medical  records  were  not  provided,  meaningful  informed  consent \nconcerning Trent W.’s psychotropic medication was not possible. \n61.  The primary care visit noted that Trent W. was having problems sleeping, and had \nbeen prescribed Trazodone to help with his sleeping issues.    \n62.  Eventually, in March 2020, Trent W. was placed in a therapeutic foster home. \n63.  In late June 2020, Trent W. underwent a psychological re-evaluation.  This re-\nevaluation was conducted by the same psychologist who had performed the 2018 evaluation of \nTrent W.  The re-evaluation concluded that Trent W. had been accurately diagnosed with autism-\nspectrum disorder and that Trent W. had impairments in communication, understanding social \ncues, and interacting with his peers.        \n64.  Notably, the 2020 re-evaluation confirmed the finding made in 2018: that Trent W. \ndid not have ADHD.  \n65.  However, upon being placed into state custody in January 2020 until November \n2020, Trent W. was prescribed, and took, a stimulant psychotropic medication aimed at treating \nthe condition he did not have, ADHD.  Throughout that time, Defendants failed to provide Trent \nW.’s caregivers and doctors with up-to-date medical records or a medical passport indicating he \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 15 of 73    PageID #:\n456\ndid not have ADHD, and Defendants failed to ensure a sufficient informed consent process \noccurred for evaluating the propriety of the ADHD medication. \n66.  The continued administration of the stimulant medication harmed Trent W. \n67.  Specifically, the psychologist who reevaluated Trent W. in June 2020 noted that his \nthen-current treatment of stimulant medication was “not appropriate and is contra-indicated.”  The \npsychologist further concluded that it was likely that the administration of the psychotropic \nstimulant medication was contributing to Trent W.’s hyperactivity and was exacerbating his sleep \nproblems.  \n68.  According  to  that  psychologist,  Trent  W.’s  worsening  behavioral  difficulties, \nincluding self-harm, could be attributed to his medication.  The psychologist noted that the \ncontinued medication of Trent W. was concerning based on his previous medical history and \ndiagnoses, which included his diagnoses of autism and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Defendants \nfailed  to  disseminate  the  medical  record  from  this  re-evaluation,  and  Defendants  failed  to \nincorporate this re-evaluation’s critical information into an informed consent process regarding \nthis medication. \n69.  As  a  result,  following  his  June  2020  psychological  re-evaluation,  Trent  W. \nremained on the stimulant to treat ADHD despite ruling out a diagnosis of ADHD in 2018 and \nconfirming that finding in June 2020.  To his Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review \nprocess has been triggered by this inappropriate and harmful prescribing practice.  \n70.  On or about November 17, 2020, following an acute crisis he experienced in \nsouthern Maine, Trent W. spent the weekend in the emergency room at Maine General Medical \nCenter in Waterville.  Trent W. was then transferred and admitted to Northern Maine Medical \nCenter, a hospital in Fort Kent.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 16 of 73    PageID #:\n457\n71.  The day after Trent W.’s admission to Northern Maine Medical Center, a team of \nindividuals associated with Trent W.’s care conducted a meeting to assess treatment of his crisis.  \nAttending this meeting were Trent W.’s OCFS caseworker, his guardian ad litem, his private-\ntreatment foster-care coordinator, a social worker, and healthcare providers from the hospital. \n72.  At the meeting, the hospital healthcare providers reported that Trent W. was on a \nstimulant. \n73.  Those team members who had knowledge of Trent W.’s prior medical history noted \nthat Trent W. should not be taking such medication because he did not have a diagnosis of ADHD. \n74.  With  this  information,  the  hospital  later  discontinued  Trent  W.’s  use  of  the \nstimulant. \n75.  The hospital also noted that Trent W. had been taking Trazodone to help with his \nsleeping problems. \n76.  Although the hospital discontinued use of the stimulant, the hospital did prescribe \nTrent W. Abilify to treat anxiety.  Trent W. remains on Abilify today. \n77.  The November 18, 2020 meeting with the hospital’s healthcare providers also \nrevealed that the hospital had no medical records for Trent W; Defendants failed to provide the \nhospital with any records documenting his recent psychological evaluation, his recent pediatric \nrapid evaluation, or records of a prior, crisis-related hospitalization.  \n78.   Accordingly, Trent W.’s guardian ad litem endeavored to obtain Trent W.’s \nrecords from a prior crisis hospitalization and fax them to Northern Maine Medical Center, and \nalso send Trent W.’s available medical history.  The guardian ad litem, however, did not have a \ncopy of Trent W.’s 2020 psychological evaluation because Defendants had not provided it, and \nthus that most recent evaluation was not immediately provided to the hospital. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 17 of 73    PageID #:\n458\n79.  Subsequently, Trent W. was discharged from the hospital in December 2020 and \nplaced in a crisis unit in Calais.  Soon after, he was placed in a therapeutic foster home in Belfast, \nMaine.  He was later moved again and now lives in a therapeutic foster home in Sydney, Maine. \n80.  From the beginning of Trent W.’s entry into state custody in January 2020, at least \nuntil his entry into the crisis unit, Defendants failed to provide those in charge of his care with up-\nto-date medical records that would contain his accurate, current medical diagnoses and use of \npsychotropic medications. Defendants failed to provide any type of accurate, current medical \npassport  listing  critical  information  about  Trent  W.’s  medical  history  and  psychotropic \nmedications as he moved from placement to placement.  There is no indication that Trent W.’s \ncaseworkers ever attended an appointment with a prescribing physician to discuss the potential \nprescription of new or existing psychotropic medications, or otherwise participated in or oversaw \nan informed consent process for Trent W.  As a result, Defendants failed to ensure a meaningful \ninformed  consent  and  review  process  to  protect  Trent  W.  from  inappropriate,  unnecessary \nadministration of psychotropic medications and related harms.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, \npolicies, patterns, customs, and/or practices have violated and continue to violate Trent W.’s \nconstitutional and federal statutory rights.  Defendants have failed to protect him from harm and \nrisk of harm while in their care by failing to adequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication \nregimens, including the administration of psychotropic medication for treatment of a diagnosis he \ndid not have; failing to ensure a consistent informed consent process; and failing to provide his \ncaregivers with updated medical and mental health records. \n81.  Trent W. remains in Defendants’ custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices.  \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 18 of 73    PageID #:\n459\niv.  Grayson M.  \n82.  Grayson M. is an 11-year-old boy from Rumford, Maine who is currently in foster \ncare.  His case is brought by his adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n83.  Grayson M. entered DHHS custody in December 2019 due to long-term physical \nabuse and neglect.  He was separated from his sibling and placed in hotels, a hospital, a crisis unit, \na kinship placement, and foster homes.  Grayson M. has had at least 9 placements over an \napproximately one-year span.  He is currently in a respite placement in South Paris, Maine.  In the \npast year, Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide oversight for Grayson M.’s safety \nand well-being with respect to psychotropic medications. \n84.  Shortly upon entering care, his January 2020 psychological evaluation reported his \nofficial diagnoses to be oppositional defiant disorder (“ODD”) and generalized anxiety disorder \n(“GAD”).  In February 2020, his medication manager reported his diagnoses as ADHD with a \npotential sensory integration disorder, without any reference to the prior diagnoses of ODD or \nGAD.  A few months later in May, his therapeutic agency reported his February diagnoses as \nADHD and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, without reference to his February 2020 potential sensory \nintegration disorder or any of this other diagnoses from January 2020.  In June, a hospital treated \nhim for a mental health crisis and simply reported his diagnosis as adjustment disorder. \n85.  Grayson M. has received psychotropic medications during much of his time in state \ncustody.  These psychotropic medications have included Risperidone (an antipsychotic) and \nMethylphenidate (a stimulant). \n86.  He  has  been  subjected  to  polypharmacy.    At  times,  Grayson  M.  has  been \nadministered Risperidone, Methylphenidate, and Melatonin concurrently.   \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 19 of 73    PageID #:\n460\n87.  Grayson M. has experienced numerous adverse effects from these psychotropic \nmedications. \n88.  Before coming into state custody, Grayson M. had a substantial, but not positive, \nmedical  history  with  psychotropic  medication.    He  had  been  prescribed  multiple  different \npsychotropic medications, but these medications had adverse, not positive, effects on him.   \n89.  Upon entering custody, in early 2020, Grayson M. informed clinicians that his \nmedications such as Risperidone did not help him and, rather, did the opposite.  His biological \nmother, who maintained parental rights, expressed apprehension, too.  She reported that such \nmedication made Grayson M. act like a zombie or stay awake for days at a time.  Nonetheless, \nGrayson M. was administered Risperidone thereafter.  He continues to receive it today. \n90.  While being prescribed Methylphenidate in early 2020, 10-year-old Grayson M. \nexperienced increased aggression.   \n91.  Around that time, he made threats to harm others and himself, self-harmed, and \nexperienced suicidal ideations.  \n92.   Both  Grayson  M.  and  his  biological  mother  reported  prior  and  then-current \nhallucinatory effects of his psychotropic medication to his clinician and caseworker in October \n2020.   \n93.  To his Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has been triggered \nby Grayson M.’s polypharmacy or adverse reactions to psychotropic medication.  \n94.  Defendants failed to communicate a sufficient informed consent or assent process \nthrough which a biological parent, his caregivers, or the child could object to Grayson M.’s \nadministration of psychotropic medications.  Accordingly, there is no formal medical record of all \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 20 of 73    PageID #:\n461\nconcerns voiced by Grayson M.’s biological parent, his caregivers, or Grayson M. himself which \nwould inform clinicians in the future treatment of Grayson M.    \n95.  In fall 2020, Grayson M. attempted to refuse his medications after reporting \nhallucinations.  Grayson M.’s biological mother also objected to the use of the psychotropic \nmedications in light of the hallucinations.  She asked his OCFS caseworker that he be taken off \nthem.  The OCFS caseworker responded that regardless of any hallucinations, he must remain on \nthe medications.  Instead of providing Grayson M.’s biological mother with any meaningful \nopportunity to be heard by a neutral decision-maker, the caseworker simply told her she was \nwelcome to contact his clinician.   \n96.  At the time of these medications’ prescription and while he was taking these \nmedications, Grayson M. and his caregivers were not consistently informed about the intended \npurpose, risks, consequences, and alternatives to treatment through an adequate informed consent \nor assent conversation.  Rather, they have little to no involvement in the decision-making process. \n97.  The  only  record  of  consent  resulted  from  a  cursory  process  initiated  by  the \nhealthcare provider, not by the Defendants.  In February 2020, a clinician faxed the clinician’s \nown consent form to Grayson M.’s OCFS caseworker, requesting the caseworker’s consent to \nprescribe Methylphenidate to Grayson M. after merely noting a few potential side effects.  The \ncaseworker signed the form five days later.  \n98.  Defendants have not provided Grayson M., his caregivers, or his medical doctors a \ncomprehensive, up-to-date medical record of current and past medications, potential adverse \neffects  and  instructions  for  current  medications,  past  adverse  reactions  to  psychotropic \nmedications, or biological family medical history.   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 21 of 73    PageID #:\n462\n99.  In Grayson M.’s recent crisis hospital stay from early October 2020 to early \nNovember 2020, upon information and belief, the hospital did not receive adequate medical and \nmental health records for Grayson M. \n100.  There is no known, up-to-date summary of Grayson M.’s medical and mental health \nhistory and treatment that has moved with him from placement to placement.  \n101.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Grayson M.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to maintain and disseminate current medical and mental \nhealth records. \n102.  Grayson M. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of harm as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices.   \nv.  Kendall P.  \n103.  Kendall P. is a 17-year-old girl from Franklin County, Maine who is currently in \nMaine foster care custody.  Kendall P.’s case is brought by her adult Next Friend Taylor S. Kilgore.  \n104.  Kendall P. has been subjected to neglect and physical abuse for most of her life.  \nMaine DHHS first took custody of her when she was 3 months old through 18 months old due to \nneglect by her mother.   DHHS and OCFS returned when she was 7 years old, and after intermittent \nnon-custodial involvement, DHHS took custody of Kendall P. again at age 15 in May 2019.  By \nthen, she had been subjected to long-term sexual abuse.   \n105.  Since  most  recently  entering  custody  in  May  2019,  Kendall  P.  has  had \napproximately 9 different placements.  She has been shuffled through unlicensed and licensed \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 22 of 73    PageID #:\n463\nhomes, treatment centers, and hospital crisis units and emergency rooms throughout Maine, such \nas in Portland, Auburn, Rangeley, Farmington, Lewiston, and Bangor.   \n106.  Kendall P.’s recent mental health diagnoses are PTSD, ADHD, and an unspecified \nmood disorder.  Her prior diagnoses have included Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, which she is no longer \ndiagnosed with.   \n107.  Kendall P. has been repeatedly administered psychotropic medications while in \nstate custody, and Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for Kendall P.’s safety and \nwell-being as to how psychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n108.  As of early January 2021, her medication cocktail consisted of: (1) Abilify (atypical \nantipsychotic); (2) Hydroxyzine Pamoate (anti-anxiety sedative, generic for Vistaril); (3) Prazosin \nHCI (anti-anxiety alpha blocker, generic for Minipress); (4) Strattera (antidepressant sNRI whose \nFDA indication is to treat ADHD); (5) Lexapro (antidepressant SSRI); and (6) Propranolol (anti-\nanxiety beta blocker, generic for Inderal).  Her prescriptions for Prazosin HCI and Propranolol \nhave since been discontinued. \n109.  Kendall P. has experienced numerous adverse effects as a result of the psychotropic \nmedications she’s been administered. \n110.  In Kendall P.’s own words, she does not feel right when she is taking psychotropic \nmedications.  Instead, she often feels like a “zombie.”  At other times, she feels as if she’s crawling \nout of her own skin.   \n111.  She  has  suffered  increased  anxiety  and  depression  while  taking  psychotropic \nmedications. \n112.  Kendall P. has experienced suicidal ideations as well as attempted harm toward \nherself and others.  In June 2020, she eloped from a residential treatment home to lay down in the \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 23 of 73    PageID #:\n464\nmiddle of a four-way intersection in the middle of a rainy night, intending to kill herself.  In July \n2020, Defendants then sent Kendall P. to a residential treatment center in Bennington, Vermont, \nwhere she remains today under DHHS custody. \n113.  Kendall P. has also experienced severe weight gain due to psychotropic medication.  \nFrom April 2020 to October 2020, she gained over 60 pounds while taking the antipsychotic \nZyprexa, known to cause severe weight gain.  She reported this to her clinicians and explained that \nher body felt very heavy, she had a hard time moving her body, and she did not feel like herself.  \nNonetheless, she remained on this medication for months. \n114.  At the time of these medications’ prescription and while she was taking these \nmedications, Kendall P. and her caregivers were not adequately informed about the risks, potential \nconsequences of, and alternatives to these medications.   \n115.  Defendants did not communicate an effective informed consent or assent process \nthrough which Kendall P. or her caregivers could object to taking medications.  Due to the lack of \na clear informed consent and assent process, Kendall P. often continued taking psychotropic \nmedications that actively harmed her because Defendants did not define a coherent path for \nrefusing her medications and transitioning to less harmful treatments or medications.   \n116.  Kendall P. repeatedly requested to stop or revisit her psychotropic medication \nprescriptions.  Unfortunately, however, this was typically ignored by her OCFS caseworkers and \nproviders. \n117.  On  one  occasion  on  or  about  May  2020,  Kendall  P.  reported  to  her  OCFS \ncaseworker her concerns about the way that Zyprexa harmed her.  Instead of providing her with \nany information about Kendall P.’s decision-making role or any process to be heard by a neutral \ndecision maker, the caseworker incorrectly informed Kendall P. that they must do whatever her \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 24 of 73    PageID #:\n465\ndoctor says.  Kendall P. subsequently met with the doctor and her guardian ad litem Next Friend \nto inform the doctor of these adverse effects and to request to be taken off the medications.  When \nKendall P. asked if there were any alternatives to these medications, the doctor replied no and that \nshe needed to remain on the medication.  Kendall P. felt defeated and anxious. She believes that \nshe does not have any voice or autonomy with respect to her psychotropic medications. \n118.  Instead of being adequately informed and involved in the decision-making process \nfor medication changes, Kendall P. is often notified of medication changes after the fact.  This has \nfurthered her anxiety.   \n119.  For instance, in the first week of December 2020, her caseworker and clinician \nmade a decision about a medication change for Kendall P. without involving Kendall P. in any \ncapacity.  On December 8, 2020, her guardian ad litem Next Friend reported to her OCFS \ncaseworker, aunt, and clinician that Kendall P. feels like her recent medication change has caused \nincreased anxiety along with night terrors, fears of being attacked, and inability to sleep.  On \nDecember 9, the clinician reported to the Next Friend that the OCFS caseworker recently approved \na medication change to begin the following day to help with anxiety.  When her Next Friend \nmentioned the medication change to Kendall P., Kendall P. asked what she was talking about.  \nKendall P. was never involved in any conversation to discuss any specific proposed change, ask \nquestions, consider the risks and benefits, learn about alternatives, or provide consent.  Kendall P. \nbecame confused and even more anxious.  When she informed staff about her anxiety over this \nunknown medication change, staff directed Kendall P. to take her anxiety medication.   \n120.  This early December surprise medication change ended up being the addition of \nLexapro, which has reportedly not helped with her anxiety. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 25 of 73    PageID #:\n466\n121.  One week later in mid-December, Kendall P. was subjected to another surprise \nmedication change.  Similarly, this new psychotropic medication was approved without Kendall \nP.’s  involvement  in  the  decision-making  process.    Unbeknownst  to  Kendall  P.,  her  OCFS \ncaseworker and her clinician reached out to Kendall P.’s medication provider to request and \napprove a medication change.  Her clinician notified Kendall P. after the fact that Kendall P. would \nbe adding Propranolol to her cocktail of drugs.  Kendall P. felt upset but agreed to try the \nmedication to avoid trouble.  The day after Kendall P. tried the Propranolol, she felt so fatigued \nthat she slept the entire day.  She worries that the Propranolol will continue to interfere with her \nfunctioning and her goals.  In Kendall’s own words, “I don’t want another med[ication]; I wanted \nsupport for the anxiety.”  \n122.  Kendall  P.’s  foster  parent  recently  expressed  concerns  about  Kendall  P.’s \npsychotropic medications.  Her aunt suggested to Kendall P.’s OCFS caseworker and clinician that \nit may be better for Kendall P. to be removed from all of her medications, like a doctor had once \ndone years prior.  The caseworker did not address her concern or otherwise provide her with any \nopportunity to be heard.    \n123.  To Kendall P. and her Next Friend’s knowledge, no secondary review process has \nbeen triggered by any of this.  \n124.  Defendants have not given Kendall P., her caregivers, or her medical doctors an up-\nto-date comprehensive medical and mental health record of her current and past medications, \npotential and past adverse effects, instructions, or biological family medical history.   \n125.  For instance, Kendall P. was previously placed in two residential treatment centers \nprior to her current DHHS custody period.  However, there is no medication history or any record \nof her prior treatments from those facilities accessible to those charged with caring for Kendall P.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 26 of 73    PageID #:\n467\n126.  Kendall P. and her Next Friend are not aware of any portable record of her critical \nmental health information that has moved with her from placement to placement. \n127.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Kendall P.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect her from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a consistent \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide her caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n128.  Kendall P. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \nvi.  Neville H.  \n129.  Neville H. is a 10-year-old boy from Biddeford, Maine who is currently in Maine \nfoster care custody.  At age 4, he was removed from his home due to abuse and neglect.  Neville \nH.’s case is brought by his adult Next Friend Sandra Romano-Shain.  \n130.  While in foster care, Neville H. has been placed in 4 different foster homes and 2 \nresidential placements throughout Maine:  Long Island, Buxton, Cornish, Kennebunk, Auburn, \nand  Bridgton.  During  the  span  of  these  varied  placements,  he  had  5  separate \nhospitalizations.  Neville H. currently lives in a residential group home in Bridgton. \n131.  Neville H.’s recent mental health diagnoses are chronic PTSD, disruptive behavior \ndisorder, and reactive attachment disorder.   \n132.  He has been repeatedly administered psychotropic medications while in state \ncustody, and Defendants have failed in their obligation to provide for Neville H.’s safety and well-\nbeing as to how psychotropic medications are administered and monitored.   \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 27 of 73    PageID #:\n468\n133.  Shortly  after  entering  foster  care,  he  was  administered Tenex  to  manage  his \nbehavior.   \n134.  At age 5, he was placed on Prozac, an antidepressant.  Neville H.’s long-term \ntherapist expressed anger and confusion to his OCFS caseworker about the administration of \nProzac to Neville H., who was only in kindergarten at the time.  Upon information and belief, \nDefendants did not follow-up with the prescriber or conduct any sort of secondary review in \nresponse.  \n135.  Neville H. has been subjected to polypharmacy while in state care. \n136.  His current medication cocktail consists of Seroquel (an atypical antipsychotic), \nGuanfacine (an alpha agonist), and Melatonin.   \n137.  Neville  H.  has  experienced  adverse  effects  as  a  result  of  the  psychotropic \nmedications he has been administered. \n138.  For instance, while taking Seroquel, he experienced a 30 to 40 pound weight gain \nover the course 6 months.  At a meeting with his OCFS caseworker, a doctor suggested that \nSeroquel caused his weight gain.  Neville H. remains on Seroquel. \n139.  Neville H. has experienced lethargy and drowsiness.  Although he entered care as \na vivacious, engaging youngster, he now struggles to  carry a conversation and avoids eye \ncontact.  Although he has been found to be of average intelligence, 10-year-old Neville H. tests at \na first grade reading level and a second grade math level. \n140.  He has experienced suicidal ideation and increased aggression.     \n141.  Neville H.’s Next Friend recounts that his behaviors have only become worse after \nhe began taking psychotropic medications, such that “he is not the same child.”  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 28 of 73    PageID #:\n469\n142.  The long-term administration of psychotropic medications to Neville H. from age \n5 though today at age 10 has not helped to improve his behaviors.  \n143.  Defendants have not communicated an effective informed consent or assent process \nthrough which Neville H. and his caregivers could meaningfully participate in the informed \nconsent process.   \n144.  Prior to his psychotropic medications’ prescriptions and during their continued \nadministration, Neville H. and his caregivers were not consistently informed about the intended \npurposes, risks, potential consequences of, and alternatives to his psychotropic medications.   \n145.  Neville H.’s assent is not regularly sought from him, nor is he regularly included in \nconversations about his medications. \n146.  In summer 2017, a doctor removed a medication from Neville H.’s cocktail and \nprescribed a new medication, but his foster parents only learned of these medication changes after \nthe fact.  They were not involved in any meaningful informed consent process prior to these \nchanges and later objected to their lack of any involvement.  \n147.  To his Next Friend’s knowledge, no meaningful secondary review process has been \ntriggered for Neville H. \n148.  Defendants have  not provided Neville H. and  all his caregivers and medical \nproviders with a current, updated comprehensive medical and mental health record for Neville H. \n149.  For instance, a doctor treating Neville H. in a psychiatric hospital informed an \nOCFS caseworker that he did not have Neville H.’s psychotropic medication history.  Specifically, \nhe considered the possibility of treating Neville H. with a new antidepressant or anti-anxiety \nmedication, but he did not know if Neville H. was previously administered the antidepressant \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 29 of 73    PageID #:\n470\nProzac or the antipsychotics Risperidone or Abilify, or how those medications may have fared in \nthe past. \n150.  Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices \nhave violated and continue to violate Neville H.’s constitutional and federal statutory rights. \nDefendants have failed to protect him from harm and risk of harm while in their care by failing to \nadequately oversee harmful psychotropic medication regimens, failing to ensure a meaningful \ninformed consent process, and failing to provide his caregivers with updated medical and mental \nhealth records. \n151.  Neville H. remains in foster care custody and continues to be at risk of injury as a \nresult of Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, and/or practices. \nB.

Lambrew, Ph.D., the Commissioner of the Maine DHHS, is sued in her \nofficial capacity only.  Defendant Lambrew maintains her principal office at Maine DHHS, 109 \nCapitol Street, Augusta, Maine 04333.  Defendant Lambrew is vested under state law with “all of \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 31 of 73    PageID #:\n472\nthe powers and duties necessary to carry out the mission and responsibilities” of DHHS.  The \nmission and responsibilities of DHHS expressly include “provid[ing] supportive, preventive, \nprotective,  public  health  and  intervention  services  to  children,  families  and  adults,”  and \n“assist[ing] individuals in meeting their needs and families in providing for the developmental, \nhealth and safety needs of their children, while respecting the rights and preferences of the \nindividual or family.”  \n156.  Todd A. Landry, the Director of the Maine OCFS, also known as the Central Bureau \nof Child and Family Services, is sued in his official capacity only.  Defendant Landry maintains \nhis principal office at the Maine OCFS Central Office, 2 Anthony Avenue, 11 State House Station, \nAugusta, Maine 04333.  Defendant Landry oversees the office that is “primarily responsible for \nthe  development,  delivery  and  oversight  of  all  activities  attendant  to  Child  Protective  and \nChildren’s Services,” and which “drafts, implements and monitors all aspects of programs relating \nto child welfare by way of State Plan for Child Welfare Services.” \n157.  Ms. Lambrew and Mr. Landry, in their official capacities as Commissioner of \nDHHS and Secretary of OCFS, respectively, are responsible for Maine’s Title IV-E Agency, which \nis the State of Maine, Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child and Family \nServices. \nIV. CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n158.  Plaintiffs Bryan C., Henry B., Trent W., Grayson M., Kendall P., and Neville H. \nbring this action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and 23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on \nbehalf of themselves and a class of similarly situated children.  \n159.  This action is properly maintained as a class action pursuant to Rules 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 32 of 73    PageID #:\n473\n160.  The putative class (“the Class”) is defined as all children who are or will be in \nDHHS foster care custody and who are or will be prescribed or administered one or more \npsychotropic medication while in state care.  Psychotropic medications are medications that impact \nemotions or behavior.  Psychotropic medications include medications in the drug classes of:  \nantidepressants;  antipsychotics;  stimulants;  alpha  agonists  (e.g.,  Clonidine,  Guanfacine); \nanxiolytics (anti-anxiety) / hypnotics (e.g., benzodiazepines, non-benzodiazepines); and mood \nstabilizers  (e.g.,  lithium).    They  also  include  medications  from  the  anticonvulsant  and \nantihypertensive drug classes when the medication is prescribed for a behavioral health indication.    \n161.  The  Class  is  sufficiently  numerous  to  make  joinder  impracticable.    Upon \ninformation and belief, at least hundreds of children in Maine foster care receive psychotropic \nmedications.  As of December 1, 2020, an estimated 2,316 children were in the legal custody of \nDHHS.  Defendant Landry stated in November 2019 that 20.8% of children in Maine foster care \nwere administered one or more psychotropic medications.  That would equate to almost 500 \nchildren in the current foster care population.  Joinder of hundreds of children would be unduly \nburdensome and impractical in these circumstances. \n162.  The Named Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately represent and protect the interests \nof the entire Class. \n163.  The violations of law and resulting harms averred by the Named Plaintiffs are \ntypical of the legal violations and harms suffered by all class members. \n164.  Each Named Plaintiff appears by a Next Friend.  Each Next Friend has sufficient \nknowledge and familiarity with the facts of their respective Named Plaintiffs as well as the \nsystemic common deficiencies underlying this complaint.  Each Next Friend is dedicated to fairly \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 33 of 73    PageID #:\n474\nand adequately representing the best interests of their respective Named Plaintiffs as well as the \nbest interests of the putative class.  \n165.  Named Plaintiffs and the Class are represented by attorneys employed by: (i) \nChildren’s Rights, a non-profit organization whose attorneys have substantial experience and \nexpertise in child welfare institutional reform class actions; (ii) Bernstein Shur, a private law firm \nbased in Portland with extensive experience in complex civil and public interest litigation, \nincluding class action litigation; and (iii) Maine Equal Justice, a nonprofit civil legal aid and \neconomic justice organization working to increase economic security, opportunity, and equity for \npeople  in  Maine  with  deep  knowledge  and  expertise  on  Maine’s  state  agencies  and  local \npopulation. \n166.  These attorneys (collectively, “Plaintiffs’ Counsel”) have identified and thoroughly \ninvestigated all claims in this action, and they have committed sufficient resources to represent the \nClass. \n167.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to the Class, \nnecessitating declaratory and injunctive relief for the Class.  Plaintiffs’ Counsel knows of no \nconflicts among class members. \n168.  The questions of fact and law raised by Named Plaintiffs’ claims are common to \nand typical of those raised by the putative class of children they seek to represent.  Each child in \nthe Class relies on Defendants for their safety and well-being, including their physical and mental \nhealth.  The longstanding and well-known systemic deficiencies of DHHS and OCFS in relation \nto its centralized administration and oversight of psychotropic medications place all children in \nfoster care custody at a common and ongoing risk of harm.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 34 of 73    PageID #:\n475\n169.  Defendants have acted or failed to act on grounds generally applicable to all \nmembers of the Class, necessitating class-wide declaratory and injunctive relief. \n170.  Questions of fact common to the Class include: \ni.  Whether  Defendants,  through  their  actions  and  inactions,  have \ndemonstrated  a  uniform  policy,  pattern,  custom  and/or  practice  of \ninadequately monitoring and overseeing the administration of psychotropic \nmedications to children in the custody of DHHS by failing to: (a) maintain \ncomplete, current, and reasonably accessible medical records, including \nmedication history for children in foster care, and to provide these records \nto foster caregivers and health care providers to facilitate the effective \ndelivery  of services;  (b)  operate a statewide secondary  review system \ncapable of timely identifying and addressing outlier prescribing practices to \nassure the safe administration of drugs to foster children; (c) ensure that \nadequate  informed  consent  with  adequate  notice  and  a  meaningful \nopportunity to be heard is obtained prior to and throughout the time that \nchildren in foster care are administered any psychotropic medications, or \ninstitute a procedure to ensure that all psychotropic medications are given \nappropriately and only when necessary; and (d) maintain a uniform policy, \npattern,  custom,  and/or  practice  providing  for  periodic  review  or \nreconsideration  of  the  prescription  and  administration  of  psychotropic \nmedications to children in foster care. \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 35 of 73    PageID #:\n476\nii.  Whether these systemic failures result in harm or the substantial risk of \nserious harm to children administered psychotropic medications while in \nDHHS custody. \n171.  Questions of law common to the Class include: \ni.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s substantive due process rights to be free \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm while in state custody, as guaranteed by \nthe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; \nii.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s procedural due process rights to be free \nfrom the unnecessary and inappropriate administration of psychotropic \nmedication as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution, including whether the Class, through an independent \nadult, receives adequate notice and an opportunity to be heard; \niii.  Whether Defendants’ actions and inactions, policies, patterns, customs, \nand/or practices violate the Class’s rights under the Adoption Assistance \nand Child Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”) to have their medical records \nkept  up-to-date  and  timely  delivered  to  their  foster  caretakers  upon \nplacement in their home; and  \niv.  Whether the class members are entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief \nto vindicate the rights they have been denied. \n \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 36 of 73    PageID #:\n477\nV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nA.  Substantial Risks of Emotional, Psychological, and Physical Harm Attend the Use of \nPsychotropic Medications in Children.    \n \n172.  As a federal district court in Missouri recently explained in M.B. v. Corsi, No. 2:17-\nCV-04102-NKL, 2018 WL 327767, at *2 (W.D. Mo. Jan. 8, 2018), “psychotropic drugs are \npowerful medications that directly affect the central nervous system. They are particularly potent \nwhen administered to children.  Children administered psychotropic medications are at particularly \nserious risk of long-lasting adverse effects. They are more vulnerable to psychosis, seizures, \nirreversible movement disorders, suicidal thoughts, aggression, weight gain, organ damage, and [] \nlife-threatening conditions,” among other things.  “Thus, due to the serious risks associated with \npsychotropic drugs, they should be administered to children only when necessary, and safely, and \naccordingly it is critical that children being administered these medications are monitored.”  Id. at \n*3. \n173.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has not approved the use of many \npsychotropic medication for children, as they have not proven safe and effective in children.  For \nthose psychotropic medications that are FDA-approved for children or adolescents, FDA approval \ntypically limits usage to children with specific serious diagnoses, such as schizophrenia and bipolar \ndisorder, and older age groups.  For instance, not a single atypical antipsychotic—such as \nAripiprazole/Abilify, Risperidone/Risperdal, Quetiapine/Seroquel and Paliperidone/Invega—has \nbeen approved for children under age 5. \n174.  Little  scientific  research  has  been  conducted  on  the  safety  and  efficacy  of \npsychotropic medications in children, in contrast to rigorous testing in the adult population.  Given \nthis circumstance, the medical, legal, and child welfare communities have all deemed the use of \npsychotropic medications in children particularly risky. \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 37 of 73    PageID #:\n478\n175.  For instance, the American Bar Association has stated that “[l]ittle is known about \nhow [psychotropic] medications impact children and adolescents in the short or long term. \nChildren are not just ‘mini adults’; they cannot just be given a smaller dose because they have \nsmaller bodies.” \n176.  More recently, the International Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry \nand Allied Professions (“IACAPAP”) stated that “[p]harmacological treatment during human \ndevelopment [such as childhood and adolescence] may result in toxicities that are not seen in adults \n. . . and result in unwanted long-lasting changes.” \n177.  The Administration for Children and Families (“ACF”), the office within the U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services charged with administering the federal Title IV-E \nfoster care program, acknowledged in 2019 that “research on the safe and appropriate pediatric \nuse of psychotropic medications lags behind prescribing trends. . . . In the absence of such research, \nit is not possible to know all of the short- and long-term effects, both positive and negative, of \npsychotropic medications on young minds and bodies.” \n178.  All of these uncertainties have not stopped physicians or others from routinely \nprescribing these drugs to children “off-label,” a term the FDA defines as the “[u]napproved use \nof an approved drug.”  At least one study has shown that approximately 45% of medications to \ntreat emotional or behavioral disturbances in children or adolescents are prescribed off-label. \n179.  While some of the risks to children may not be well known, psychotropic drugs are \nalready known to cause serious and sometimes irreversible side effects, even in adults.  These well-\ndocumented physical and mental harms include:  \n▪  Kidney, thyroid, liver and pancreas damage; \n▪  Psychosis, suicidal thoughts, and agitation; \n▪  Blurred vision; \n▪  Nightmares and hallucinations; \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 38 of 73    PageID #:\n479\n▪  Drowsiness and dizziness; \n▪  Irreversible movement disorders (such as tardive dyskinesia), rigidity, tremor and \ntics; \n▪  Seizures; and  \n▪  Weight gain, diabetes and high cholesterol. \n \n180.  Multiple expert research bodies, including the American Academy of Pediatrics \n(“AAP”), the Government Accountability Office, the IACAPAP, the American Association of \nChild and Adolescent Psychiatry (“AACAP”), and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health \nServices Association (“SAMHSA”) have all stated the need for further research on the safety, \neffectiveness, and long-term effects of psychotropic medications in children. \n181.  In the developing brain and body of a child, psychotropic medications may induce \nadverse effects more frequently and with greater severity. A 2019 medical review article that \nexamined  a  decade  (2007-2017)  of  FDA  drug  trial  data  for  common  antipsychotics  and \nantidepressants found that adverse drug effects were significantly worse for children than adults \nin over 60% of the studied combinations of medications.  Recent studies have linked psychotropic \nmedications to the worsening of certain liver conditions in children, linked stimulant psychotropic \nmedications to elevated cardiovascular risk factors, and demonstrated disturbing links between \nantipsychotics and unexplained deaths among youth. \n182.  A  2018  psychiatry  clinical  trial  concluded  that  the  “potential  benefits  [of \nantipsychotic medications] should be carefully weighed against the risk for adverse changes in \ntotal and abdominal adiposity and insulin sensitivity, known contributors to the development of \nearly-onset type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other illnesses associated with premature \nmorbidity and mortality.” \n183.  Many psychotropic medications—including all second generation antipsychotics  \nand SSRIs—come with “black box” warning labels indicating that “their use requires particular \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 39 of 73    PageID #:\n480\nattention and caution regarding potentially dangerous or life threatening side effects.”  It is \ncommonly recognized that these drugs may increase the risk of “suicidal thinking and behavior \n(suicidality) in children, adolescents and young adults,” and that patients starting these drugs \nshould be “monitored appropriately and observed closely for clinical worsening, suicidality, or \nunusual changes in behavior.”  The stimulant class of psychotropics, commonly used to treat \nADHD, carries a black box warning for abuse potential, sudden death, and serious cardiovascular \nevents.  Black box warnings for mood stabilizing and anticonvulsant psychotropics also include \npotentially life-threatening complications. \n184.  Given the numerous side effect profiles, there are strict recommended metabolic \nmonitoring schedules  for  the  various  psychotropic  drug  classes  that  include  baseline  blood \npressure, body mass index, blood glucose, and lipid panels, as well as follow-up monitoring every \nfour weeks for the first twelve weeks, followed by quarterly measurements throughout treatment.  \nHowever, those monitoring schedules are often not followed.  A 2018 review of Medicaid Analytic \nExtract data found that only approximately 8% of foster children on antipsychotics received \nbaseline metabolic screening and only approximately 25% reported evidence of any annual \nmetabolic laboratory monitoring.  Given psychotropic medications’ serious side effects, the failure \nto monitor them can have life-threatening consequences.  Hence, strict monitoring and effective \noversight policies are crucial. \n185.  AACAP, the leading professional organization dedicated to promoting psychiatric \ncare and healthy development of children and adolescents, posits that “[b]est practice does not \ninvolve psychotropic medication as the sole intervention for youth with complex mental health \nneeds.  Psychosocial interventions, particularly those that are evidence-based and systematically \nmonitored, are also essential.” \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 40 of 73    PageID #:\n481\n186.  An ACF report using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-\nBeing explained that “the use of medications without simultaneous use of psychosocial treatments” \nequates to potential inappropriate psychotropic medication use.  \n187.  SAMHSA describes the need for a two-step monitoring process prior to prescribing \nantipsychotics to youth and over the course of their care that answer the following questions: \nA)  Prior to initiation: “Has the patient received an adequate trial of first‐line, \nevidence‐based psychosocial therapy and medication treatments before starting an \nantipsychotic?” \n \nB) Over the course of care: “What is the plan to monitor risks and benefits of \ntreatment and timeframe that ineffective or poorly tolerated medication will be \ndiscontinued?” \n188.  Too frequently, psychotropic medications are administered to achieve behavioral \ncontrol rather than to treat an underlying trauma.  For instance, for some mental health disorders \nsuch  as  Reactive  Attachment  Disorder  or  Disinhibited  Social  Engagement  Disorder,  no \npsychopharmacological  intervention  trials  have  been  conducted  to  date,  nor  are  there  any \nindications to prescribe medications to treat these disorders, yet children are still prescribed \npsychotropic medications to “treat” these disorders. \n189.  Children in foster care are also particularly vulnerable to high-risk prescriptions \nbecause “the majority of physicians responsible for prescribing psychotropic medication to foster \nchildren are pediatricians or general psychiatrists without formal training in child and adolescent \npsychiatry and may not have an abundance of exposure to concerns specific to children in foster \ncare.”  AACAP practice guidelines makes clear that a comprehensive psychiatric evaluation of a \nchild should be completed before any pharmacological intervention is considered.  Such an \nevaluation “increases the likelihood that medication interventions will be well conceptualized and \nhopefully reduce the likelihood of treatment failure and poor adherence.”   However, despite these \nrecommendations, a 2018 Medicaid data review study found that over 40% of foster children with \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 41 of 73    PageID #:\n482\nantipsychotic  prescriptions  did  not  receive  appropriate  first-line  psychosocial  care  prior  to \ninitiation of the medications. \n190.  Given  the  lack  of  research  on  the  safe  and  appropriate  use  of  psychotropic \nmedications in children, and the inherent vulnerabilities of this population, it is of particular \nconcern when children in foster care are exposed to “outlier” prescribing practices.  In 2012, ACF \nissued guidance to states on implementing effective oversight of psychotropic medications for \nyouth in foster care.  ACF defined “outlier practices” as “[p]atterns that may signal that factors \nother than clinical need are impacting the prescription of psychotropic medications.”  As a federal \njudge noted in 2018, this means that “for many, if not most, of the affected children, psychotropic \ndrugs are administered to treat a diagnosis that the drugs were never designed to address” in \nchildren.  M.B. v. Corsi, 2018 WL 327767 at *2. \n191.  ACF has identified the following three outlier areas of concern that should trigger \nheightened scrutiny: “instances where children are prescribed too many psychotropic medications, \ntoo much medication, or at too young an age,” commonly referred to as “too many, too much, and \ntoo young.”  Foster children have been found to be at increased risk of all three of these harmful \npractices. \n192.  Too many.  Polypharmacy (the use of multiple psychotropic medications at once) \nis increasingly prevalent in the foster care population, despite long-standing awareness of “the lack \nof supporting evidence and the potential for adverse effects (e.g., side effects, drug interactions, \nmetabolic effects, and potential that some medications may alter nervous system development).”   \nEvidence from a Medicaid data review shows that foster children are over two times more likely \nto be prescribed multiple concurrent antipsychotics than their non-foster Medicaid insured peers. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 42 of 73    PageID #:\n483\n193.  There is “scant evidence” that using multiple psychotropic medications at once is \neffective in children, particularly of the antipsychotic class, and no research exists to support the \nuse of five or more psychotropic drugs in tandem.  Leading medical guidance bodies including \nSAMHSA and AACAP both support the need to start “low and go slow” and ensure appropriate \nclinical monitoring throughout. \n194.  Experts report that “increasing the number of drugs used concurrently increases the \nlikelihood of adverse reactions and long-term side effects, such as high cholesterol or diabetes, \nand limits the ability to assess which of multiple drugs are related to a particular treatment goal.” \nFor  instance,  medical  research  studying  the  incidence  of  type  2  diabetes  among  children \nadministered an antipsychotic medication found that children given an antipsychotic were three \ntimes more likely than non-medicated children to suffer from diabetes.  Multiple studies show side \neffects increase with polypharmacy, with one study showing five times the risk of obesity with \ntwo or more antipsychotics.  Additional research has found the risk of developing diabetes was \neven greater for children given an antidepressant concurrently with the antipsychotic. \n195.  Another study gathering information from parents about adverse effects of one or \nmore psychotropic medications given to youth found: \n•  The number of adverse effects increased with the number of medications being \nused.  In comparison with children taking one medication, those taking two drugs \nreported on average 17% more adverse effects while those taking three or more \nmedications reported on average 38% more adverse effects.  \n•  The  side  effect  profile  shifted  for  children  depending  upon  the  number  of \nmedications  taken.    Suicidality  and  self-harm  became  more  frequent  with \nincreasing numbers of medication.  Increased appetite, sleepiness/fatigue, and \ntics and tremors were approximately 200 to 300% more prevalent among children \ntaking three or more medications than those taking only one drug.  \n•  The  number  of  adverse  effects  increased  the  longer  the  child  was  on  the \nmedication. \n•  Polypharmacy  regimens  including  antidepressants  (SSRIs)  or  antipsychotics \nwere especially associated with adverse effects. \n \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 43 of 73    PageID #:\n484\n196.  Children in foster care are frequently subjected to polypharmacy practices.  For \ninstance,  they  are  frequently  administered  an  antidepressant  psychotropic  and  a  stimulant \npsychotropic concurrently.  Data to substantiate the safety and efficacy of this combination of \ndrugs is lacking.   \n197.  Additionally, a recent study found low rates of de-prescribing of antipsychotics \namong foster youth.  This means that once a provider prescribes a psychotropic medication, they \nare less likely to remove this drug in the future, even when clinically warranted. \n198.  An ACF report using data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-\nBeing stated that “the use of three or more medications simultaneously” constitutes a potentially \ninappropriate psychotropic use. \n199.  Too  much.    Because  the  majority  of  pediatric  psychotropic  medication  is \nprescribed off-label, there are very few research-based guidelines for medication dosages, which \nwould typically be supplied by FDA prescription labels.  For this reason, it is a cause for concern \nwhen children are prescribed these medications at dosages that exceed recommendations. \n200.  The above-mentioned 2018 ten-state Medicaid study showed that foster children, \neven when compared to other Medicaid-insured youth, are twice as likely to receive higher than \nrecommended doses of antipsychotics.  Experts report that this practice “increases the risk of \nadverse side effects and does not typically increase the efficacy of the drugs to any significant \nextent.” \n201.  Too young.  Young children are particularly vulnerable to the possible adverse side \neffects  of  psychotropic  medications.    For  instance,  experts  have  reported  that  there  is  “no \nestablished use [for psychotropic medications] for mental health conditions in infants [under age \none]; providing them these drugs could result in serious adverse effects.”  Moreover, it is generally \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 44 of 73    PageID #:\n485\naccepted that drugs in the class of atypical antipsychotics, one of the most powerful psychotropic \ndrug categories, should never be administered to children below the age of 5.  An ACF report using \ndata from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being concluded that “the use of \nmedications in children under the age of 6 years” or “the use of any antipsychotic for all ages and, \nspecifically, for children under the age of 6 years” consists of potential inappropriate psychotropic \nuse. \nB.  Federal Law and Professional Standards Require That States Have in Place a \nSystem  to  Oversee  the  Administration  of  Psychotropic  Medications  to \nChildren in Foster Care.  \n \n202.  The  vital  need  for  rigorous  and  effective  administration  and  oversight  of \npsychotropic medication use for children in foster care is well-established.   \n203.  Under federal law, the “Maine Department of Health and Human Services[], Office \nof Child and Family Services” must develop “a plan for the ongoing oversight and coordination of \nhealth care services for any child in a foster care placement,” which must include “an outline of . \n. . the oversight of prescription medicines, including protocols for the appropriate use and \nmonitoring of psychotropic medications.”  See 42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(15)(A), 622(b)(15)(A)(v).    \n204.  ACF has directed that “[s]trengthened oversight of psychotropic medication use is \nnecessary in order to responsibly and effectively attend to the clinical needs of children who have \nexperienced  maltreatment”  and  urged  “close  supervision  and  monitoring  .  .  .  [and]  careful \nmanagement and oversight” in the use of psychotropic medications for children. \n205.  “For the[ir] APSR [Annual Progress and Services Report] submission,” ACF \nrequires that:  \nStates must provide information on . . . [t]he protocols used to \nmonitor  the  appropriate  use  of  psychotropic  medications  for \nchildren and youth in the foster care system.  States must support \ntheir choice of protocols and provide additional information on how \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 45 of 73    PageID #:\n486\nthe  child  welfare  workforce  and  providers  are  trained  on  the \nappropriate use of psychotropic medications.  The State’s protocol \nmust address:  \n \n• Comprehensive  and  coordinated  screening,  assessment,  and \ntreatment  planning  mechanisms  to  identify  children’s  mental \nhealth  and  trauma-treatment  needs  (including  a  psychiatric \nevaluation,  as  necessary,  to  identify  needs  for  psychotropic \nmedication);  \n• Informed and shared decision-making (consent and assent) and \nmethods for ongoing communication between the prescriber, the \nchild, his/her caregivers, other healthcare providers, the child \nwelfare worker, and other key stakeholders;  \n• Effective medication monitoring at both the client and agency \nlevel;  \n• Availability of mental health expertise and consultation regarding \nboth consent and monitoring issues by a board-certified or board-\neligible Child and Adolescent Psychiatrist (at both the agency and \nindividual case level); and  \n• Mechanisms  for  sharing  accurate  and  up-to-date  information \nrelated to psychotropics to clinicians, child welfare staff, and \nconsumers.  This should include both data sharing mechanisms \n(e.g., integrated information systems) and methods for sharing \neducational materials. \n \n206.  Additionally, AACAP has published recommended practices for child welfare \nagencies to implement in overseeing the mental health treatment of children in foster care, \nincluding active monitoring to assure safe utilization of psychotropic medications.  AACAP \nexplained that children in state custody “often have no consistent interested party to provide \ninformed consent for their treatment, to coordinate treatment planning and clinical care, or to \nprovide longitudinal oversight of their treatment.”  Thus, “[t]he state has a duty to perform this \nprotective role for children in state custody.” \n207.  A 2019 Research Summary by the publicly-funded Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute (“PCORI”) recommended that states implement six policies and practices \nconcerning psychotropic medication and oversight for youth in out-of-home care, based on \n“current research and best practices”:  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 46 of 73    PageID #:\n487\n•  Implement  a  robust  informed  consent  and  informed  assent \npolicy that ensures consenters and youth have the information \nthey  need  and  access  to  consult  a  child  and  adolescent \npsychiatrist to make a truly informed decision; \n•  Create  a  centralized,  up-to-date,  accessible  medical  records \nsystem; \n•  Implement  monitoring  and  oversight  systems  that  will  flag \ndangerous outlier prescribing practices for peer review both \nprospectively and retrospectively, and will seek to curb such \npractices moving forward; \n•  Promote safe prescribing practices, including by ensuring the \navailability  of  concurrent  psychosocial  services  and  closely \ntracking required bloodwork monitoring; \n•  Provide ready access to pertinent information for clinicians, \nfoster parents, and other caregivers; [and] \n•  Collect, track, and analyze relevant data to evaluate the efficacy \nof various initiatives implemented. \n \n208.  Over the past several years, Maine has repeatedly acknowledged these federal laws \nand standards, as well as the compelling need to implement a robust system to protect children in \nfoster care from unsafe medication practices.   \n209.  For instance, Maine Citizen’s Review Panel Recommendations for a Coordinated \nHealth Plan for Children in Foster Care told OCFS in as early as 2014 that “[t]he State of Maine, \nin order to be in compliance [with federal law], needs to meet the requirements as stated in the \nFederal Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008,” including a \nsystem for “oversight of prescription medicines” that includes an “outline of ‘protocols for the \nappropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications.’” \nC.  Maine Defendants Have Long Acknowledged the Risks Associated with the \nImproper  Administration  and  Inadequate  Oversight  of  Psychotropic \nMedications to Children As Well As Maine’s Own Systemic Failures. \n \ni.  Defendants Fully Understand the Dangers Associated with the Improper \nUse and Oversight of Psychotropic Medications in Children.       \n \n210.  For years, DHHS and OCFS have repeatedly acknowledged their awareness of the \nserious risks accompanying the use of psychotropic medications in foster care populations.  In \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 47 of 73    PageID #:\n488\ndoing so, they have openly endorsed the same scientific principles discussed above in Section \nV(A). \n211.  For instance, in 2012, several DHHS officials authored a report with the Maine \nIndependent Clinical Information Service detailing the serious harms associated with psychotropic \nmedication administration to children.  It stated that “[s]ide effects can lead to or exacerbate other \nhealth problems.  Children on these drugs are prone to significant weight gain, which can lead to \ndiabetes and other weight-related issues, such as cardiovascular risks.” \n212.  That same year, then-OCFS Director Therese Cahill-Lowe and then-OCFS Medical \nDirector Lindsey Tweed attended the conference entitled “Because Minds Matter: Collaborating \nto Strengthen Management of Psychotropic Medications for Children and Youth in Foster Care.”  \nThis conference taught state agencies the serious risks of harms associated with psychotropic \nmedications, the need for robust oversight mechanisms, and how to reform a state’s oversight \nsystem in order to adequately protect children.  It provided Defendants and other attendees many \ntools to protect foster children from harm.    \n213.  In 2013, the then-OCFS Director gave opening remarks at a conference that \nexplored  the  trend  of  “skyrocket[ing]”  psychotropic  drug  prescriptions  for  children  and \nadolescents “in spite of the fact that there is an absence of valid research to support the practice.”  \nThe  conference  brochure  explained  that  “[u]nbiased  scientific  research  indicates  that  these \nmedications  have  questionable  effectiveness  and  that  their  use  poses  serious  long-term \nconsequences to developing brains and bodies.” \n214.  In November 2019, OCFS Director Todd Landry and the acting Medical Director \nof OCFS acknowledged that “[p]sychotropic medications alone are often not the best treatment” \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 48 of 73    PageID #:\n489\nfor foster youth, and that “[t]hey should typically be used with non-pharmacological interventions, \nsuch as behavior interventions and behavioral health therapy, for long-lasting effects.” \n215.  At that time, they expressly admitted that outlier prescription practices of “[t]oo \nmuch,” “[t]oo many,” and “[t]oo young”—as well as “[t]oo long”—are all problematic “[c]oncerns \nin [f]oster [c]are” with respect to psychotropic medications.  OCFS also acknowledged the risks \nof “[m]edical side effect[s] [and] complication[s]” associated with psychotropic medications. \n216.  Substantial numbers of children in DHHS foster care custody continue to be \nprescribed psychotropic medications in the absence of an oversight system that ensures their \nsafety.  Despite their awareness of the risks, Defendants failed to implement an adequate system \nof safeguards and oversight of psychotropic medications to adequately protect Maine foster \nchildren from ongoing substantial risks of serious harm.   \n \nii.  DHHS  and  OCFS  Fully  Understand  That  Their  Own  System  Lacks \nAdequate Safeguards and Oversight Mechanisms to Protect Hundreds of \nMaine Foster Children from Ongoing Substantial Risks of Serious Harm. \n \n217.  Besides  acknowledging  the  substantial  dangers  associated  with  psychotropic \nmedications, supra § V(C)(i), DHHS and OCFS have been made aware of and even expressly \nacknowledged their own system’s failures that expose hundreds of foster children in their custody \nto those substantial dangers.  Nonetheless, DHHS and OCFS have still failed to implement a robust \nsystem of safeguards and oversight of psychotropic medications to adequately protect foster \nchildren. \n218.  As  early  as  2010,  DHHS  and  OCFS’s  then-Medical  Directors  publically \nhighlighted some of Maine’s oversight problems.  They acknowledged that children in Maine \nfoster care are disproportionately prescribed psychotropics, stating that the rate of “foster children \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 49 of 73    PageID #:\n490\n[] on mental health drugs [is] 3x the rate of non-foster children,” and that as to antipsychotics, it is \neven higher at “4x the rate of usage in non-foster children.”  They also highlighted Maine’s unsafe \npolypharmacy practices, stating that “1 in 10 MaineCare [Medicaid] members [including foster \nchildren] under 19 is on 4 or more mental health medications in the course of a year.”   \n219.  That same year, the Child Welfare Services Maine Ombudsman “brought a serious \nconcern  to  the  Department’s  Divisions  of  Child  Welfare  and  Children’s  Behavioral  Health \nregarding the use of anti-psychotic medication with children and youth in DHHS custody,” and \n“the Department’s [DHHS’s] Medical Directors for child . . . mental health also raised this \nconcern.”  They warned that Maine “still rel[ies] too much on psychiatric medications like anti-\npsychotic drugs” that “have serious long-term side effects, and that state wards are much more \nlikely to be prescribed this medication than other children and youth.” \n220.  In 2011, the following year, the Ombudsman again raised the same concern.  He \nfound that the “use of psychotropic medications for youth in care” child welfare policies and \npractices within DHHS/OCFS required further development.  He classified the “[a]ppropriate use, \nand follow-up of psychotropic medication for youth in care” as challenges for DHHS, and he \nrecommended  that  DHHS/OCFS  reform  their  child  welfare  policies  and  practices  as  to \n“psychotropic medications for youth in care.”   \n221.  Shortly thereafter in 2012, several Maine officials within DHHS authored a report \non medication for children and youth in which they acknowledged that “there may be some overuse \n[of antipsychotic psychotropic medication] that can be reduced” in Maine. \n222.  Also in 2012, a Maine DHHS official shared a 2009 study showing that 37% of \nfoster children in Maine were on mental health drugs compared to only 12.3% of non-foster \nchildren, and that 19.2% of foster children were on four or more mental health drugs compared to \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 50 of 73    PageID #:\n491\nonly 12% of non-foster children.  As a result of these findings, the official stated that the Drug \nUtilization Review investigated and “found evidence that most prescribers writing for these \nmedications were family practitioners and not providers that have the appropriate education to \nwrite prescriptions for these meds [sic].”  \n223.  Several years later, Maine’s psychotropic oversight issues became the subject of \nnational attention.  In 2018, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services OIG issued a \nreport entitled “Treatment Planning and Medication Monitoring Were Lacking for Children in \nFoster Care Receiving Psychotropic Medication.”  The OIG investigated Maine because it was \none of the worst states nationwide, with one of the five “highest utilization of psychotropic \nmedications in their foster care populations.” \n224.  OIG conducted its review and issued the 2018 OIG Report because “[u]p to 80 \npercent of children enter foster care with significant mental health needs” and may be prescribed \npsychotropic “medications [that] can have serious side effects.”  But even though “ACF suggests \nand the five States [including Maine] in [their] sample require [that psychotropics] [] be used in \nconjunction with treatment planning mechanisms and effective medication monitoring,” there are \nstill “serious quality-of-care concerns in the treatment of children with psychotropic medications.” \n225.  The 2018 OIG Report made clear that DHHS and OCFS’s practices do not pass \nmuster, not even by their own policies.  It concluded that Maine does not fully comply with its \n“own [s]tate requirements for treatment planning and medication monitoring for children in foster \ncare receiving psychotropic medication.” \n226.  For  instance,  although  Maine  has  written  state  requirements  that  foster  care \nmedication plans be reviewed quarterly, the 2018 OIG Report found that “26 percent of children \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 51 of 73    PageID #:\n492\nin foster care [in Maine] had a medication plan that was not reviewed quarterly by the treatment \nprovider.” \n227.  Although Maine acknowledges the importance of formal treatment planning, the \n2018 OIG Report found that “28 percent of children in [Maine] foster care did not receive a \ntreatment plan.” \n228.  And although Maine acknowledges the importance of medication monitoring, the \n2018 OIG Report found that “11 percent of children in foster care did not receive medication \nmonitoring by a prescribing professional.”    \n229.  In  addition,  although  Maine  Defendants’  policy  requires  the  “caseworker  to \nparticipate in medical or psychiatric appointments where antipsychotic medications are initially \ndiscussed and a determination is made to proceed or not, and then at least every 3 months \nfollowing,” the 2018 OIG report found that a shocking “59 percent of children [prescribed \nantipsychotic medications] did not have a caseworker who participated in initial medical or \npsychiatric appointments and then at least every 3 months following.” \n230.  Besides identifying Defendants’ overt failures to satisfy Maine’s own policies, the \n2018 OIG Report also revealed fundamental problems with the policies themselves.  For instance, \nit found that requirements “did not always include suggested professional practice guidelines \ndesigned to protect [] children.”  As such, the OIG warned that “[i]mproved compliance and \nstrengthened [s]tate requirements are imperative to provide protections for children who are at risk \nfor inappropriate treatment and inappropriate prescribing practices.”  \n231.  After the 2018 OIG Report’s release in September 2018, Defendants expressed \nawareness of the report and Maine’s specific issues highlighted therein.  For instance, in OCFS’s \nDecember 2018 Children’s Behavioral Services Assessment, DHHS and OCFS discussed the \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 52 of 73    PageID #:\n493\nReport  and  its  findings—admitting  Maine’s  “lack  of  monitoring,”  its  need  to  ensure  that \npsychotropic medications are “appropriately monitored,” and “need for service quality measures”: \nIn September 2018, the United States DHHS Office of Inspector \nGeneral  (OIG)  produced  a  report  concerning  the  medication \nmanagement and treatment of youth entering foster care. This OIG \nreport found that out of the 3,527 children in foster care in Maine, \n1,155  of  them  (32.7  percent)  were  treated  with  psychotropic \nmedications. The report also found that although Maine requires a \ntreatment plan for children in foster care, 28 percent did not have \ntreatment plans. Additionally, the report found that 26 percent of \nmedication plans were not reviewed quarterly as required and that \n11 percent of children in foster care did not receive medication \nmonitoring by a prescribing professional. The lack of monitoring by \na prescribing professional may be a result of the statewide shortage \nof child psychiatrists in Maine. This report highlights the importance \nof  behavioral  health  providers  and  child  welfare  staff  working \ntogether collaboratively to ensure these children receive needed \ntreatment and that medication is appropriately monitored and the \nneed for service quality measures particularly around the use of \npsychotropic medication. \n \n232.  In a news article on the 2018 OIG Report entitled “Few Safeguards Exist for Foster \nKids on Psych Drugs,” the former OCFS Medical Director commented that “[i]t would be great \n[for  Maine]  to  get  more  focus  and  more  resources  on  treatment  planning  and  treatment \nmonitoring.” \n233.  In December 2018, the Public Consulting Group (“PCG”) published an assessment \nof Maine DHHS’s children’s behavioral health services that highlighted the OIG Report and \nMaine’s oversight problems.  PCG stressed the “importance of behavioral health providers and \nchild welfare staff working together collaboratively to ensure these children receive needed \ntreatment and that medication is appropriately monitored and the need for service quality measures \nparticularly around the use of psychotropic medication.”  PCG recognized the OIG Report’s \nrecommendations  that  DHHS  must  implement  greater  oversight  to  protect  children  from \nsubstantial risk of serious harm. \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 53 of 73    PageID #:\n494\n234.  In late 2019, former OCFS Medical Director Matt Lahaie gave a presentation to the \nMaine Chapter of the AAP concerning “Psychotropic Medication in Maine Foster Youth.”  He, \ntoo, referred to the 2018 OIG Report, which found that Maine has one of the highest rates in the \ncountry of young people in foster care being prescribed psychotropics. \n235.  Despite having known for years of the risks associated with these medications and \nthe large numbers of children in Maine foster care who are prescribed such medications, to this \nday, OCFS continues to fall short of its responsibility for protecting children from harm.  As further \nset forth below, Defendants have not implemented an adequate system of safeguards and oversight \nof psychotropic medications to protect Maine foster children from ongoing substantial risks of \nserious harm.   \nD.  Defendants Fail to Maintain Complete and Current Medical Records for the \nClass and to Provide These Records Promptly to Caregivers.  \n \n236.  The case plan and case review system requirements of the Adoption Assistance and \nChild Welfare Act of 1980 (“AACWA”), under Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, require child \nwelfare agencies to maintain and share up-to-date medical records as part of a written case plan \nfor each and every child in care. \n237.  The case plan is a written “plan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper \ncare and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster parents in order to . . . address \nthe needs of the child while in foster care.”  By law, that plan must contain “the health . . . records \nof the child, including the most recent information available regarding . . . the names and addresses \nof the child’s health . . . providers, . . . the child’s known medical problems, the child’s medications, \nand any other relevant health . . . information.” \n238.  Additionally, child welfare agencies must have a case review system and procedure \nto ensure their requirements that each “child’s health record . . . is reviewed and updated” and that \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 54 of 73    PageID #:\n495\n“a copy of the record is supplied to the foster parent or foster provider with whom the child is \nplaced, at the time of each placement of the child in foster care.” \n239.  These requirements reflect the critical need for caregivers to have immediate access \nto a child’s full medical history in order to ensure effective medical and mental health care for \nchildren, including the administration of psychotropic drugs when applicable.    \n240.  Defendants agree with this.  OCFS’s own policy acknowledges the critical role of \nchild and family health information in assessing health status, providing continuity of health care, \navoiding duplication of services, and carrying out the DHHS’s duties and responsibilities toward \nchildren in its custody. \n241.  Unfortunately,  however,  DHHS  and  OCFS  fail  to  adequately  maintain  and \ndisseminate to the necessary individuals complete and current medical records including sufficient \ninformation on psychotropic medications. \n242.  Defendants’ written case plans that must contain health records are insufficient, and \nDefendants agree.  In the “Written Case Plan[s]” Item of Maine’s most recent Child & Family \nServices Review (“CFSR”), Maine was labelled as “[n]eeding [i]mprovement.”  In Maine’s 2020-\n2024 Child & Family Services Plan, OCFS and DHHS wrote that “[h]istorically, OCFS has \nrecognized [written case plans] as being a challenge.” \n243.  OCFS has a “Health Records” policy that is deficient and not implemented in \npractice.  Upon information and belief, this policy dates back to 1994 and has been unchanged \nsince 2002—almost two decades—despite recommendations to OCFS in the interim to update its \npolicies to ensure better oversight of psychotropic medications.  For instance, the 2009 Child \nWelfare Services Ombudsman Report “recommend[ed] the further development of policy . . . by \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 55 of 73    PageID #:\n496\nOCFS, to ensure the safety and wellbeing of children in care who are prescribed these high-risk \nmedications.” \n244.  That almost 20-year-old OCFS “Health Records” policy requires that a child’s \nhealth history is “sought prior to any out-of-home placement.”  Certain child health information, \nincluding serious medical conditions, allergies, and medications for chronic and acute conditions, \nmust be provided directly to the foster parent or other child care provider at the time of the child’s \nplacement with them, or to the caseworker responsible for placing the child.  Additional child \nhealth information is to be gathered after the child has entered custody, and the child’s health \nrecord is to be updated. \n245.  The  Child  Welfare  League  of  America  (“CWLA”)  has  promulgated  widely-\naccepted standards that instruct public child welfare agencies to develop “an abbreviated health \nrecord, such as a medical passport, that accompanies the child throughout the child’s stay in out-\nof-home care.”  This critical record is to include, among other things: “[t]he child’s health history \nprior to placement[;] . . . health status immediately before entering care[;] . . . [a]ny medical, dental, \nmental health, or developmental problems[;] . . . [c]urrent medications[;] . . . [and a]llergies. . . . \n[It] should [additionally] prominently identify . . . any medication allergies.”  CWLA standards \nfurther provide that the agency should update this record “in a timely manner, entering information \nabout the child’s health status, services, and needs as soon as [it] becomes available.” \n246.  Similarly, AACAP recommends maintenance of “an ongoing record of diagnoses, \nheight  and  weight,  allergies,  medical  history,  ongoing  medical  problem  list,  psychotropic \nmedications, and adverse medication reactions that are easily available to treating clinicians 24 \nhours a day.”  Review of these records “to assess past successful and unsuccessful treatments can \n. . . reduce the chance that previously ineffective treatments will be used again.” \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 56 of 73    PageID #:\n497\n247.  OCFS’s written policy requires portable health records for children in DHHS \ncustody.  Among other requirements, the portable health record is supposed to move with the child \nfrom placement to placement and contain an on-going record of medical care sought and received \nwhile the child is in custody.  It is supposed to include medical diagnoses and treatment, psychiatric \nand psychological information, a brief history including traumatic events, an ongoing record of \ncare and psychiatric treatment while in state custody, and medication history, such as the name, \nstrength, dosage, frequency, start date, and stop date.  By policy, this portable health record for \neach child in custody is to be given to foster parents, residential facilities, caseworkers, and other \ncaregivers, and it must be updated by the caseworker every six months and each time the child \nmoves placements.   \n248.  Despite its federal and policy obligations, OCFS fails to promptly prepare and \ndeliver portable health records containing critical information on psychotropic medications at the \ntime a child is placed in their foster home or other placement.   \n249.  Upon information and belief, instead of receiving critical written information about \nthe child’s health and psychotropics upon placement, foster placements often receive only a plastic \nbag filled with drugs.  Too often, they have little idea what to do with them, what side effects to \nlook out for, and how to effectively care for that child’s specific needs.   \n250.  OCFS recently admitted that portable health records do not, in practice, move with \nthe child from placement to placement, and that they are not promptly provided to placements \nwhen the child arrives there.  Although their own policy expressly requires the state to provide a \nportable health record upon foster care placement, OCFS’s 2015 Annual Report to the Legislature \nstated that “[f]oster parents shall request a medical history of [the] child at the time of placement.” \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 57 of 73    PageID #:\n498\n251.  Even if OCFS were properly maintaining, reviewing, and updating medical records \nor portable health records in practice, they would be of no use if the individuals charged with \ncaring for and, in some cases providing informed consent for medications being given to those \nchildren, do not have ready access to them.  OCFS often fails to provide the required medical \nrecords to foster caregivers, as required by law and policy.  Upon information and belief, foster \ncaregivers are often provided incomplete health records and medication histories for children in \ntheir care, or are provided with no health or medication information at all—such that no essential \npsychotropic medication information arrives with the child or moves from placement to placement.  \nInstead, upon information and belief, foster children often arrive with only a bag of medications. \n252.  Without a system to ensure that foster caregivers are consistently provided with this \ninformation,  caretakers  are  often  left  to  conduct  their  own  research  into  a  child’s  health \ninformation, contacting physicians whose names are on pill bottles, with little guidance as to what \nmedications to administer, when and how to administer them, potential risks and adverse effects, \nand how to respond when a child experiences adverse effects.  Defendants’ failure to maintain \ncomplete and current medical records for the Class and to provide these records to caregivers \nharms children and subjects them to continuing and imminent risk of serious harm. \n253.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  do  not  have  a  quality  assurance \nmechanism or other means of tracking their compliance with their federal obligations. \nE.  Defendants Fail to Assure a Meaningful Informed Consent Process.  \n \n254.  A minimally adequate informed consent process generally requires that a doctor \nprovide full information about the risks and benefits of a particular psychotropic medication before \nexpress  authorization  is  given  by  an  appropriate  adult  consenter  for  the  medication  to  be \nadministered to the child.  \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 58 of 73    PageID #:\n499\n255.  In a 2012 Information Memorandum, the federal government identified the “need \nfor written policies” with provisions for “[i]nformed and shared decision-making (consent and \nassent) and methods for on-going communication between the prescriber, the child, his/her \ncaregivers, other healthcare workers, [and] the child welfare worker” as an element that is \nconsistently  included  in  guidelines  and  recommendations  for  the  systemic  monitoring  and \noversight of psychotropic medications in the foster care context. \n256.  AACAP standards further clarify that “[a]lthough particularly important at the time \nof  psychotropic  medication  initiation,  informed  consent  and  assent  are  ongoing  processes.  \nInformed consent involves discussion of target symptoms, likely benefits of a potential treatment, \npotential risks of treatment, and risks of not pursuing the treatment in question.  Documentation of \nthe discussion is essential, to provide clear evidence of what occurred.” \n257.  OCFS’s own policy acknowledges the importance of the informed consent process \nin delivering and assuring safe and appropriate care to children, stating that: \nAll  clients,  including  children  and  youth,  have  the  right  to \nparticipate in all service decisions, review their treatment, case or \nservice plan, refuse any service unless mandated by law or court \norder  and  be  informed  about  the  consequences  of  refusal  or \ndisengagement with services. The client of mental health services \nshould be provided with a copy of the Rights of Recipients of Mental \nHealth Services published by DHHS. Clients must be informed of \ntheir right to choice in the selection of a service provider qualified \nto meet the assessed service or treatment need. Services are to be \nprovided to meet the assessed need and should not go beyond the \nscope of that need unless requested by the client. The client is to be \ninformed  prior  to  any  engagement  in  services  of  their  rights \nregarding confidentiality and privacy protections by the provider. \nDHHS staff must comply with the DHHS confidentiality policy. \n \n258.  OCFS has not promulgated a policy setting forth the informed consent process or \nprocedures for all classes of psychotropic medications.  Rather, OCFS has promulgated an \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 59 of 73    PageID #:\n500\ninformed consent policy only with respect to the class of antipsychotic medications, and that policy \nis wholly insufficient—even as to antipsychotics. \n259.  That OCFS policy, titled “Use of Antipsychotic Medications for Youth in Foster \nCare,” provides that absent certain emergency or urgent circumstances, youth over 14 can only be \nprescribed medication that they, their caretaker and their prescriber all consent to, but is silent as \nto who must provide consent for youth under 14.  The policy includes an Antipsychotic Medication \nConsent Worksheet, which states that youth under 14 should assent to use of medication, and \nwhich, upon information and belief, is not consistently employed.  The child’s “caseworker is \nrequired to be present in person or by phone at the appointment with the prescriber at the first \nappointment and every three months following or as requested by the caregiver or provider to \nattend.”  “Prior to any consideration of medication to address a child’s mental health needs[,] the \ntreating provider must be given a full description of the circumstances of the child that follows a \nCasework Review.” \n260.  OCFS’s existing informed consent policy on antipsychotics is deficient on its face \nin at least the following ways: \ni.  The  policy  addresses  informed  consent  only  for  the  administration  of \nantipsychotics, rather than for all psychotropic medications. \nii.  The policy does not provide for the involvement of a child’s biological parent(s) \nin the informed consent process, even if the biological parents’ rights have not \nbeen terminated. \niii.  The  policy  does  not  include  a  process  to  resolve  disagreements  among \ncaregivers, parents, caseworkers or providers over whether a medication should \nbe administered. \niv.  The policy lacks a complete list of the factors that should be considered before \nmaking a decision. \nv.  The policy does not adequately give a timeline for continuing, changing, and \ndiscontinuing prescriptions. \nvi.  The policy does not provide for a uniform system for tracking informed consent \nand assent both at an individual-case and aggregate level to facilitate oversight. \nvii.  The policy does not provide for or require any periodic review of the initial \nconsent nor set forth factors that require a reconsideration of initial consent, \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 60 of 73    PageID #:\n501\nwhich may result in foster children continuing on a regimen of medications for \nmonths or years without review. \nviii.  The  policy  lacks  a  detailed  process  for  informed  consent  in  emergency \nsituations. \nix.  It is unclear who is required to complete the Antipsychotic Medication Consent \nWorksheet and where it must be stored, if at all. \n \n261.  This lack of a streamlined process to evaluate a refusal to consent or assent to the \nadministration of psychotropic medications without a meaningful opportunity to be heard can \nresult in a child being unwillingly subjected to medications with potentially serious side effects. \n262.  Because the OCFS policy for Use of Antipsychotic Medications for Youth in Foster \nCare is so limited and ambiguous, it is often either misapplied, misunderstood, or entirely \noverlooked by caseworkers and caregivers in securing informed consent for children in DHHS \ncustody. \n263.  For instance, although Maine’s antipsychotic policy requires caseworkers to attend \nappointments with prescribers where antipsychotics are discussed, it does not specify whether the \ncaseworkers must attend appointments where other classes of psychotropics are discussed, and it \ndoes not specify whether and how the caseworkers should be involved in the informed consent \ndecision-making process at any such appointments.   \n264.  Although their attendance is required by this policy, in practice, caseworkers are \nnot routinely present at these meetings or involved in these consent conversations.  Tellingly, 59% \nof a sample of 39 Maine foster children prescribed antipsychotics did not have a caseworker who \nparticipated in initial medical or psychiatric appointments and then at least every 3 months \nfollowing. \n265.  Maine’s antipsychotic policy also neglects to involve a child’s biological parent(s) \nin the informed consent process, even if the parents’ rights have not been terminated.  For instance, \nthe antipsychotic policy does not require that biological parents receive notice when a healthcare \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 61 of 73    PageID #:\n502\nprovider recommends the prescription of a new psychotropic medication to the child.  Likewise, \nthe policy does not require that other appropriate adults, such as a child’s guardian ad litem or \ncourt-appointed special advocate, be notified of informed consent requests.  Nor is there a process \nset forth in the policy for resolving disagreements between caregivers, parents, caseworkers, or \nproviders over whether the child should receive psychotropic medication.  And there is no process \nin  the  policy  by  which  an  alternative  adult  may  seek  to  serve  as  the  child’s  consenting \nauthority.  Consequently, the lack of involvement of appropriate adults in the informed consent \nprocess can subject foster children to the administration of psychotropic medications without \nadequate notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard. \n266.  Similarly, although informed consent is an ongoing process, Maine’s policy does \nnot expressly provide a timeline for continuing, changing, and discontinuing prescriptions, or for \nthe expiration of informed consent and assent.  The 2018 OIG Report found that in a sample of \n120 Maine foster children prescribed psychotropic medications, approximately 26% did not have \ntheir medication plan reviewed quarterly by the treatment provider, and approximately 11% did \nnot receive any medication monitoring by a prescribing professional.  These numbers indicate that \na significant percentage of Maine foster children on psychotropics thus did not have a proper \nongoing informed consent and assent process under the AACAP standards. \n267.  Despite  the  critical  importance  of  obtaining  proper  informed  consent,  upon \ninformation and belief, OCFS has no system to track compliance with the agency’s informed \nconsent policy across all children in care, betraying the widely recognized principle that “you \ncannot manage what you cannot measure.” \n268.  Specifically, OCFS has no system for tracking in the aggregate whether (a) the \nchild’s  parents  are  engaged  in  medical  decision-making  when  available,  (b)  the  assigned \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 62 of 73    PageID #:\n503\ncaseworker is notified by the resource parents before they administer medication to a child for \nwhich the resource parents provided informed consent to the prescriber, (c) youth are given the \nopportunity for informed assent before going on a psychotropic medication regimen, or (d) when \nmedication is refused, whether the appropriate procedures are followed and documented before \nOCFS overrides this refusal.  Absent this aggregate data, OCFS is unable to identify and timely \ncorrect areas of non-compliance with this important policy, leaving children at risk. \n269.  Furthermore, the lack of comprehensive and up-to-date medical records for all \nchildren in care makes it likely that medications may be approved without the benefit of knowing \na child’s health history, which could include allergies to medication, documented adverse effects \nto medications, or failed previous attempts with that very same drug.   \n270.  This risk is exacerbated by Maine’s scarcity of prescribers with a scarcity of time \nto devote to each child.  In December 2018, the PCG report concluded that “there is a severe \nshortage of child and adolescent psychiatrists in Maine.”  As such, Maine foster children are often \nprescribed psychotropic medications by others, such as pediatricians or nurse practitioners. \n271.  In the absence of an effective informed consent process, OCFS has failed to \ninstitute any other procedures to ensure that informed consent is obtained for the administration of \npsychotropic medications to children in custody. \n272.  Further, DHHS and OCFS’s policies and practices further fail to ensure that the \nadult providing informed consent is appropriately positioned to exercise informed, objective \njudgment in the best interest of the child.   \n273.  For instance, although the antipsychotic informed consent policy requires that the \ntreating provider must be given a full description of the circumstances of the child that follows a \nCasework Review prior to any medication administration, caseworkers who could have access to \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 63 of 73    PageID #:\n504\nthis information routinely do not attend these medication administration appointments, supra ¶¶ \n263-64, and foster parents routinely do not receive vital information about their child’s health and \nmedication history and adverse reactions, supra ¶¶ 236-52.  Further, Maine’s antipsychotic policy \ndoes not provide for the involvement of biological parents, guardians ad litem, court-appointed \nspecial advocates, or other appropriate adults in the informed consent process, and it does not set \nforth  a  process  for  resolving  disagreements  regarding  whether  the  child  should  receive \npsychotropic medications.  DHHS and OCFS fail to provide foster children with a sufficient \nprocess for obtaining initial and ongoing informed consent, including adequate notice and a \nmeaningful opportunity to be heard prior to and throughout the time that children in foster care are \nadministered psychotropic medications. \nF.  Defendants  Fail  to  Operate  a  Monitoring  and  Oversight  System  That \nPromptly  Flags  Outlier  Prescriptions  and  Subjects  Them  to  Secondary \nReview.  \n \n274.  Absent access to comprehensive medical records and effective informed consent, \nprocedures to  ensure  that outlier prescription  practices  are  timely  identified  and  subjected \nto secondary review are particularly critical.  The 2015 AACAP recommendations, as well as \nguidance from ACF and professional organizations, call for collaboration between child welfare \nagencies,  Medicaid  agencies,  and  mental  health  agencies  to  effectively  monitor  the  safe \nadministration of psychotropic medication to children in foster care.  In particular, AACAP calls \nfor the systemic capacity to identify “red flag criteria triggering external reviews,” and for \n“[m]andatory consultations with an identified child and adolescent reviewer” in response to \nidentified  red  flags.   ACF  guidance  similarly  calls  for  systems  designed  to  flag  outlier \nprescriptions,  including  “instances  where  children  are  prescribed  too  many  psychotropic \nmedications, too much medication, or at too young an age:  too many, and too much, too young.” \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 64 of 73    PageID #:\n505\n275.  OCFS  currently  fails  to  operate  a  monitoring  and  oversight  system \nthat adequately flags outlier prescriptions of psychotropic medications to children in its custody \nand subjects these prescriptions to a secondary review. \n276.  A sizeable number of states, including several New England states, have established \nand published red flag criteria which trigger mandatory secondary reviews of designated outlier \nprescriptions.  Maine has not developed such red flag criteria, thereby failing to meet the minimal \nstandard of care in the field. \n277.  Additionally, Maine has failed to implement a secondary review system that utilizes \nchild  psychiatrists  to  undertake  the  secondary  reviews.   In  its  “Practice  Parameters  for  the \nAssessment and Management of Youth Involved with the Child Welfare System,” AACAP \nstresses the unique, “important role” child and adolescent psychiatrists play in psychotropic \nmedication oversight.   The use of child psychiatrists is vital, as they possess the requisite training \nand experience to conduct meaningful secondary reviews.  Oftentimes, the initial prescription to \nbe subjected to a secondary review was written by a pediatrician or nurse practitioner who does \nnot possess sufficient knowledge to assure safe practice vis-à-vis psychotropic medications for \nyouth in foster care.  AACAP specifically instructs child welfare agencies to “establish[] programs \nadministered by child psychiatrists to oversee and evaluate the use of medications for youth in \nstate custody at the individual youth and population levels.” \n278.  Furthermore, in December 2020, DHHS and OCFS identified the elimination of “a \ngroup of staff dedicated to children’s behavioral health quality assurance” as a “significant barrier \nto the goal of increasing the use of evidence-based models and evidence-informed interventions,” \nand acknowledged that there is now “limited monitoring of the quality of [behavioral health] \nservices delivered or their fidelity to evidence-based models.” \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 65 of 73    PageID #:\n506\n279.  Defendants’ failure to institute a comprehensive secondary review system places \nfoster children at risk of remaining on inappropriate psychotropic medication regimens for months, \nor even years, without a proper review by a qualified medical professional. \nVI. CAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ SUBSTANTIVE DUE \nPROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class                                        \nand against all Defendants) \n \n280.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n281.  A state assumes an affirmative duty under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \nStates Constitution to protect a child from an unreasonable risk of harm once it takes that child \ninto its foster care custody. \n282.  The foregoing policies and practices of Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute a failure to meet their affirmative duty to protect the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \nfrom an unreasonable risk of harm.  These failures are a substantial factor leading to, and proximate \ncause of, the ongoing violation of the class members’ constitutionally-protected fundamental \nliberty  interests  conferred  upon  them  by  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution. \n283.  Defendants are well aware of the policies and practices that constitute a failure to \nprotect the Class from an unreasonable risk of harm. \n284.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that are contrary to law and are substantial \ndepartures from any accepted professional judgment such that they are outside of that judgment. \nDefendants’ actions and inactions are also in deliberate indifference to their awareness of facts \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 66 of 73    PageID #:\n507\nfrom which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists for Named \nPlaintiffs and the Class.  As a result of Defendants’ actions and inactions, Named Plaintiffs and \nthe Class have been harmed or are at continuing and imminent risk of serious harm, and have been \ndeprived of their substantive due process rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n285.  These substantive due process rights include, but are not limited to: the right to \nprotection from harm or unreasonable risk of harm while in state foster care custody; the right to \nnecessary treatment, care, and services to protect class members from deteriorating or being \nharmed physically, psychologically, developmentally, or otherwise while in state foster care; and \nthe right to adequate supervision and monitoring of class members’ health and safety. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ PROCEDURAL DUE \nPROCESS RIGHTS UNDER THE U.S. CONSTITUTION  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class \nand against all Defendants) \n \n286.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n287.  The  Due  Process  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution prohibits Defendants from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without \ndue process of law. \n288.  Foster children have a substantial liberty interest, protected by the Due Process \nClause, in being free from the unnecessary administration of medical treatment, including the \nunnecessary administration of psychotropic medication. \n289.  Defendants have a compelling interest in the protection of minor children. \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 67 of 73    PageID #:\n508\n290.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that deprive the Plaintiff Children and class \nmembers of this liberty interest without due process of law. \n291.  Defendants’ actions and inactions have interfered with the Named Plaintiffs and \nclass members’ liberty interest. \n292.  Defendants’ actions and inactions subject the Named Plaintiffs and class members \nto the unnecessary administration of psychotropic medication without having sufficient procedures \nfor ensuring that these medications are appropriately administered to the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass. \n293.  Defendants’ actions and inactions fail to provide the Named Plaintiffs and the Class \na sufficient process for informed consent, including adequate notice and a meaningful opportunity \nto be heard, prior to and throughout the time that children in foster care are administered any \npsychotropic medications. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF PLAINTIFFS’ RIGHTS UNDER THE \nFEDERAL ADOPTION ASSISTANCE AND CHILD WELFARE ACT (“AACWA”), 42 \nU.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq.  \n \n(Asserted on behalf of all Named Plaintiffs and the putative class                                        \nand against all Defendants) \n \n294.  Paragraphs 1 to 279 above are repeated and re-alleged as if fully set forth herein. \n295.  The foregoing actions and inactions of the Defendants, in their official capacities, \nconstitute policies, patterns, practices and/or customs that violate the statutory rights of the \nPlaintiff Children and class members under the federal statute AACWA, as amended by the \nAdoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 et seq., 670 et seq., and the regulations \npromulgated under the Act, 45 C.F.R. Parts 1355-1357. \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 68 of 73    PageID #:\n509\n296.  These rights include, but are not limited to, the rights of the Plaintiff Children and \nclass members to:  (a) have their own individualized “written” case plan “for assuring that the child \nreceives safe and proper care and that services are provided to the parents, child, and foster parents \nin order to . . . address the needs of the child while in foster care” that contain, inter alia, the health \nrecords of the child, which must “includ[e] the most recent information available regarding” the \nnames and addresses of the child’s health providers, a record of the child’s immunizations, the \nchild’s  known  medical  problems,  the  child’s  medications,  and  any  other  relevant  health \ninformation concerning the child determined to be appropriate by the State agency; and (b) have \nhis or health records reviewed, updated, and supplied to the foster parent or foster care providers \nwith whom the child is placed before or at the time of placement.  42 U.S.C. §§ 622(b)(8)(A)(ii), \n671(a)(16), 675(1), 675(5). \n297.  These rights created by AACWA are clearly and expressly intended to benefit the \nPlaintiff Children and class members, the rights are specific and concrete requirements that are \nneither vague nor amorphous such to strain judicial competence, and the statutory provisions noted \nabove impose a mandatory, binding obligation on the states to fulfill these requirements. \nVII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF  \n298.  WHEREFORE,  the  Named  Plaintiffs,  on  behalf  of  the  putative  Class  they \nrepresent, respectfully request that this Court exercise its legal and equitable powers and award \nclass-wide relief as follows: \na.  Assert subject matter jurisdiction over this action; \nb.  Order that this action be maintained as a class action pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2); \nc.  Declare pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 57 that:  \n68 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 69 of 73    PageID #:\n510\ni.  Defendants’ failure to maintain a minimally adequate oversight system in \nrelation to the administration of psychotropic medications to the Class of \nchildren in DHHS foster care custody violates Plaintiffs’ substantive due \nprocess rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment \nto the United States Constitution to be protected from serious harm or the \nsubstantial risk of serious harm while in state custody; and \nii.  Defendants’  failure  to  institute  procedures  to  ensure  that  psychotropic \nmedications are being appropriately given to the Named Plaintiffs and the \nClass  violates  Plaintiffs’  procedural  due  process  rights  under  the  Due \nProcess  Clause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  to  the  United  States \nConstitution  to  be  free  from  the  unnecessary  and  inappropriate \nadministration of psychotropic medication; and \niii.  Defendants’ failure to (1) maintain complete and updated medical records, \nincluding, but not limited to, medication history and any history of adverse \nreactions and side effects, in the case plans of each child in the Class of \nchildren in DHHS foster care custody and (2) deliver such medical records \nto Plaintiffs’ foster caretakers upon placement violates Plaintiffs’ statutory \nrights under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act to: (a) a written \ncase plan that contains, inter alia, the health records of the child, including \nthe child’s most recent health information available regarding the names \nand  addresses  of  the  child’s  health  providers,  a  record  of  the  child’s \nimmunizations,  the  child’s  known  medical  problems,  the  child’s \nmedications, and any other relevant health information concerning the child \n69 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 70 of 73    PageID #:\n511\ndetermined to be appropriate by the State agency; and (b) to have his or her \nhealth records reviewed, updated, and supplied to foster care providers with \nwhom the child is placed before or at the time of placement. \nd.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from subjecting the Class of children in DHHS \ncustody to policies and practices that violate Plaintiffs’ constitutional and statutory \nrights as set forth in subparagraph (c) above as follows: \ni.  Medical Records: Order Defendants to: (1) implement and maintain a \ncomprehensive and updated electronic healthcare record for all children in \nDHHS foster care custody; and (2) deliver to each child’s foster caretaker \nupon placement of the child in the caretaker’s home or licensed facility a \ncomplete medical history for the child including, but not limited to, the \nchild’s prescription medication history and any history of adverse reactions \nand side effects; and \nii.  Informed Consent Policy: Order Defendants to: (1) promulgate a clear, \nunambiguous and effective informed consent policy that extends to all \npsychotropic medications; (2) develop, maintain, and review a system of \nrecords that facilitates the tracking of aggregate compliance with the above \ninformed consent policy; and (3) develop and implement a mandatory \ntraining program for all social workers and foster caretakers regarding the \nsafe administration of psychotropic medications to children and compliance \nwith DHHS policy in relation to these medications; and \niii.  Secondary Review System: Order Defendants to develop and implement a \nsecondary review system that (1) establishes and tracks “red flag” criteria \n70 \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 45     Filed 10/18/21     Page 71 of 73    PageID #:\n512\ndesignating outlier or elevated risk prescription practices in relation to the \nadministration of one or more psychotropic or antipsychotic medications to \nchildren in DHHS foster care custody; and (2) requires secondary review \nby a qualified child psychiatrist of all “red flag” prescription regimens to \nchildren in DHHS foster care custody and a feedback mechanism to the \nprescribing doctor and the adult authorized to provide informed consent on \nbehalf of the child regarding the findings of the secondary review and any \nneed for revision of the prescription; \ne.  Award to Plaintiffs the reasonable costs and expenses incurred in the prosecution \nof this action, including reasonable attorneys’ fees pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1920 \nand 42 U.S.C. § 1988 and Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(e) and 23(h); and \nf.  Grant such further equitable relief as the Court deems just, necessary, and proper \nto abate the ongoing risk of harm and protect Plaintiffs from further harm while in \nDefendants’ custody and care. \n \nDATED:  October 18, 2021 \nRespectfully Submitted, \n \nBERNSTEIN, SHUR, SAWYER & NELSON, P.A. \n \n/s/ John A.

LAMBREW, et al.,  ) \n  ) \n   Defendants.  ) \n \nORDER ON DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS \n  Before me is the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the Plaintiffs’ First Amended \nComplaint  (“FAC”).  For  the  reasons  stated  below,  the  motion  to  dismiss  is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART. \nBACKGROUND1 \n  The Plaintiffs are foster children currently in the custody of the State,2 each of \nwhom is represented by his/her state-appointed guardian ad litem as his/her next \nfriend (the “Next Friends”).3 The Plaintiffs seek to bring a class action against \nJeanne Lambrew, the Commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human \nServices (“DHHS”), and Todd Landry, the Director of the Office of Child and Family \n \n1   The facts below are drawn from the allegations in the First Amended Complaint (“FAC”), \nwhich I take as true for the purposes of deciding a motion to dismiss. Alston v. Spiegel, 988 F.3d 564, \n571 (1st Cir. 2021). \n2   The Plaintiffs are identified by pseudonyms. \n3   Several of the Plaintiffs share the same guardian ad litem, so there are three next friends \nrepresenting the six plaintiffs. \n \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 2 of 60    PageID #: 382\nServices (“OCFS”), both in their official capacities. The putative class consists of “all \nchildren who are or will be in DHHS foster care custody and who are or will be \nprescribed or administered one or more psychotropic[4] medication while in state \ncare.” FAC ¶ 160 (ECF No. 22).  \n  The Plaintiffs allege that DHHS’s system of administering psychotropic drugs \nto foster children violates the Constitution and that DHHS’s recordkeeping violates \nthe federal Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act (“AACWA”). The factual \nallegations are detailed and voluminous, but, in sum, the Plaintiffs generally allege \nthat the Defendants have failed to: (1) “maintain readily accessible, comprehensive, \nand up-to-date medical records”; (2) provide all medical records to foster caregivers \npromptly upon placement, or to all prescribing physicians for purposes of treatment; \n(3) establish an adequate informed consent process both prior to and throughout \nadministration of psychotropic medications; and (4) maintain and operate a system \nof secondary review by a child psychiatrist to ensure the safety of any psychotropic \nmedications, and combination of psychotropic medications, administered. FAC ¶ 5. \nI.  The Plaintiffs \nA.  Bryan C. \n  Plaintiff Bryan C. has been prescribed dosages of medications inappropriate \nfor a child of his size and age (seven). FAC ¶¶ 11, 16. For example, an outside doctor \n \n4   “Psychotropic medications are powerful drugs that impact emotions and behavior, such as anti-\nanxiety agents, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and antipsychotics.” FAC ¶ 2 (ECF No. \n22). These drugs can have serious side effects, including seizures, psychosis, suicidal ideation, self-\nharm, aggression, diabetes, organ damage, and even sudden death. FAC ¶ 2. These drugs are \nparticularly potent in children. FAC ¶ 2. \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 3 of 60    PageID #: 383\nnot normally in charge of Bryan’s care determined that his prescription for Vyvanse \n(a stimulant) was “entirely inappropriate” and should not have been prescribed to \nBryan at all, much less in the dosage he was receiving. FAC ¶¶ 13, 16. At one point, \na hospital directed that three of Bryan’s prescriptions should be discontinued, but \nshortly thereafter, his prior prescriber reinstated two of these medications. FAC ¶ 27. \nBryan has suffered a number of severe side effects from these medications, some of \nwhich have been treated by the administration of additional psychotropic drugs. FAC \n¶¶ 17–24, 26. \n  There  has  been  no  “effective  informed  consent  process  through  which  an \nobjective decision-maker can consent to medication for Bryan,” his caseworkers are \nnot typically present at appointments when psychotropic medications are prescribed, \nand Bryan’s caseworkers are sometimes only notified of a new prescription after the \nmedication has already begun to be administered. FAC ¶¶ 28–29. His Vyvanse \nprescription was not subject to any secondary review. FAC ¶ 16. \n  The Plaintiffs also allege deficiencies in Bryan’s medical records. He has no \nmedical passport that has moved with him from placement to placement. FAC ¶ 31. \nHis caseworkers, clinicians, and advocates do not have ready access to his prior and \ncurrent medical records, impairing their ability to monitor his medications. FAC \n¶¶ 32–33. And his caregivers, advocates, and treating physicians have not always \nhad access to updated medical records. FAC ¶¶ 30, 34. For example, Bryan received \na blood test months ago to screen for diabetes, but OCFS has been unable to produce \nthe records related to that test, and the results remain unknown. FAC ¶ 24. \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 4 of 60    PageID #: 384\nB.  Henry B. \n  Plaintiff  Henry  B.  has  been  administered  as  many  as  six  psychotropic \nmedications at a time without any secondary review of the propriety of this practice. \nFAC ¶¶ 42–43. Henry has suffered serious side effects from these medications. FAC \n¶¶ 44–47. There is no adequate informed consent process for the administration of \npsychotropic medications to Henry. FAC ¶ 48. In particular, the Defendants failed to \ninform Henry that he was entitled to have a meaningful role in the decision-making \nprocess with regard to his prescriptions. FAC ¶ 49. And despite OCFS policy requiring \nindividuals  over  the  age  of  fourteen  to  consent  to  prescriptions  in  almost  all \ncircumstances, Henry has not been included in informed consent conversations even \nafter  turning  fourteen.  FAC  ¶¶  49,  259.  Henry’s  medical  records  are  so  poorly \nmaintained, it is not even clear what his mental health diagnoses are. FAC ¶ 53. \nC.  Trent W. \n  While in state custody, Plaintiff Trent W. was misdiagnosed with ADHD and \nwas administered psychotropic medication as a result of this misdiagnosis. FAC \n¶¶ 59–60, 64–65. Trent continued to be administered medication for his ADHD while \nin state custody even after it was confirmed that he did not have ADHD. FAC ¶¶ 63–\n65, 69. In November 2020, Trent was hospitalized following an acute crisis, but at the \ntime of his hospitalization, the hospital lacked any medical records for him. FAC \n¶¶ 70, 77. Trent’s guardian ad litem tried to obtain these medical records but was not \nable to obtain all of them. FAC ¶ 78. \n  However, the Plaintiffs never allege that any of these issues are the fault of \nthe Defendants. That is, it is never alleged whether the Defendants played any role \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 5 of 60    PageID #: 385\nin Trent being administered medication for his ADHD when he did not have ADHD \nor in the hospital lacking medical records for Trent when he was hospitalized. The \nPlaintiffs only vaguely allege that the Defendants have violated Trent’s rights, FAC \n¶ 80, which is not enough to sustain a claim. However, rather than dismiss Trent’s \nclaims outright, I will allow the Plaintiffs leave to amend. Should Trent file amended \nclaims and the Defendants consider those amended claims to still be deficient, the \nDefendants are free to renew their motion to dismiss as to Trent W.  \nD.  Grayson M. \n  Prior to entering the custody of the State, Plaintiff Grayson M. had been \nprescribed psychotropic medications that had an adverse effect on him, including \nRisperidone (an antipsychotic). FAC ¶¶ 13, 88–89. Grayson informed his clinicians of \nthis, and his biological mother (who maintained parental rights) also expressed \nconcern about him being prescribed Risperidone. FAC ¶ 89. Nevertheless, Grayson \nwas prescribed—and continues to be prescribed—Risperidone. FAC ¶ 89. Grayson \nhas experienced serious side effects from his psychotropic medications. FAC ¶¶ 87, \n90–91. Grayson and his biological mother have reported some of these side effects to \nhis clinician and caseworker, but no secondary review process has occurred. FAC \n¶¶ 92–93. After Grayson tried to refuse his medications and after his biological \nmother objected to his continued use of them, OCFS required Grayson to continue to \ntake them FAC ¶ 95. The informed consent process prior to the administration of \nthese medications was inadequate, and Grayson and his biological mother have had \nlittle  to  no  involvement  in  the  decision-making  process  with  respect  to  his \nmedications. FAC ¶¶ 94, 96. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 6 of 60    PageID #: 386\n  The Defendants have also failed to provide complete and accurate medical \nrecords to Grayson, his caregivers, or his doctors. FAC ¶¶ 98, 99. \nE.  Kendall P. \n  Plaintiff Kendall P. was administered psychotropic medications without an \nadequate process of informed consent. FAC ¶¶ 114–15. Despite her repeated requests \nto stop or revisit her medications, these pleas were often ignored. FAC ¶¶ 116–17. \nKendall is often notified of changes in her medication only after the changes have \nalready been made even though she is seventeen and thus her informed consent is \nrequired under OCFS policy. FAC ¶¶ 103, 118–19, 121. She has suffered multiple \nadverse side effects from the psychotropic medications administered to her. FAC \n¶¶ 109–14, 119, 121. No secondary review process has been triggered by any of \nKendall’s objections or the side effects that she has suffered. FAC ¶ 123.  \n  The Defendants have not provided Kendall, her caregivers, or her doctors \ncomplete, updated medical records, and she has no portable record that can move \nwith her from placement to placement. FAC ¶¶ 124, 126. \nF.  Neville H. \n  Plaintiff Neville H. was administered psychotropic medications without an \nadequate process of informed consent. FAC ¶¶ 143–46. Neville has experienced \nadverse effects from his psychotropic medications. FAC ¶ 137–41. After Neville was \nplaced on Prozac (an antidepressant) at age five, his therapist expressed anger and \nconfusion about this decision to OCFS, but the Defendants did nothing to follow up \nwith the prescriber or conduct any secondary review. FAC ¶ 134. No meaningful \nsecondary review process has been conducted for any of Neville’s medications. FAC \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 7 of 60    PageID #: 387\n¶ 147.  The  Defendants  have  not  provided  complete,  updated  medical  records  to \nNeville, his caregivers, or his medical providers, which has impaired his doctors’ \nability to treat him. FAC ¶¶ 148–49. \nII.  The Claims \n  The Plaintiffs put forth three causes of action: a substantive due process claim, \na procedural due process claim, and a statutory claim. The substantive due process \nclaim is premised on the Defendants’ duty to protect the children in their care, which \nthe Plaintiffs contend has been violated by the aforementioned actions. FAC ¶¶ 280–\n81.  In  particular,  the  Plaintiffs  contend  that  the  Defendants  have  violated  the \nputative class members’ rights: (1) to protection from harm or unreasonable risk of \nharm; (2) to necessary treatment, care, and services to protect them from harm; and \n(3) to adequate supervision and monitoring of their health and safety. FAC ¶ 285. \n  With regard to the procedural due process claim, the Plaintiffs allege that they \nhave a substantial liberty interest in being free from the unnecessary administration \nof psychotropic medication and that they have been deprived of this liberty interest \nwithout sufficient procedural protections. FAC ¶¶ 288, 292–93. \n  The Plaintiffs also allege that the Defendants have violated their rights under \nthe AACWA to (1) have an individualized written case plan and (2) have their health \nrecords reviewed, updated, and supplied to a foster parent or foster care provider at \nthe time of placement. FAC ¶ 296. \n  In their prayer for relief, the Plaintiffs request injunctive relief ordering the \nDefendants to: (1) “implement and maintain a comprehensive and updated electronic \nhealthcare record for all children in DHHS foster care custody; (2) provide each child’s \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 8 of 60    PageID #: 388\nfoster  caretaker  with  the  child’s  complete  medical  history  upon  placement; \n(3) promulgate an effective informed consent policy for psychotropic medications; \n(4) develop, maintain, and review a system to track compliance with that informed \nconsent policy; (5) train all social workers and foster caretakers regarding the safe \nadministration of psychotropic drugs; (6) implement a secondary review system to \nflag outlier or elevated risk prescription practices; and (7) require secondary review \nby a child psychiatrist of all flagged prescription regimens. FAC ¶ 298(d). \nIII.  The Briefing \n  The Defendants put forward three reasons why they contend the FAC should \nbe  dismissed.  Their  primary  argument  is  that  the  Court  should  abstain  under \nYounger v. Harris because the Plaintiffs’ cases are supervised by the state courts. \nDefs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Mot.”) 10–15 (ECF No. 25). Second, they argue that \nthe Plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem are not proper representatives of the Plaintiffs and \nthat this deprives the Court of subject matter jurisdiction. Defs.’ Mot. 15–18. Third, \nthe Defendants contend that the FAC fails to state any claim upon which relief can \nbe granted. Defs.’ Mot. 18–34. The Plaintiffs dispute each of these points. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  In reviewing a motion to dismiss, I must “accept as true all well-pleaded facts \nalleged in the complaint and draw all reasonable inferences therefrom in the pleader’s \nfavor.” Alston v. Spiegel, 988 F.3d 564, 571 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting Santiago v. Puerto \nRico, 655 F.3d 61, 72 (1st Cir. 2011)). “[A] complaint will survive a motion to dismiss \nwhen it alleges ‘enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’ ” \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 9 of 60    PageID #: 389\nId.  (quoting  Bell  Atl.  Corp.  v.  Twombly,  550  U.S.  544,  570  (2007)).  A  claim  is \n“plausible” if the facts alleged give rise to a reasonable inference of liability. Id. \n“Plausible”  means  “more  than  merely  possible”  but  does  not  require  all  facts \nnecessary to establish a prima facie case. Carrero-Ojeda v. Autoridad de Energía \nEléctrica, 755 F.3d 711, 717–18 (1st Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Younger Abstention \n  I first address the Defendants’ argument that I should abstain under Younger \nv. Harris, 401 U.S. 37 (1971), because exercising jurisdiction would interfere with the \nstate judicial system. \nA.  Legal Background \n  Younger abstention is one of the few doctrines that either requires or allows \nfederal courts to defer to state proceedings, and it embodies the principle that federal \ncourts  should  “refrain  from  interfering  with  certain  state  proceedings.”  Sirva \nRelocation, LLC v. Richie, 794 F.3d 185, 191 (1st Cir. 2015) (citation omitted). But \nthe Supreme Court’s “dominant instruction” to lower federal courts is that “even in \nthe presence of parallel state proceedings, abstention from the exercise of federal \njurisdiction is the ‘exception, not the rule.’ ” Sprint Commc’ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. \n69, 81–82 (2013) (quoting Haw. Hous. Auth. v. Midkiff, 467 U.S. 229, 236 (1984)). \n“Federal courts . . . have ‘no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is \ngiven, than to usurp that which is not given.’ ” Id. at 77 (quoting Cohens v. Virginia, \n19 U.S. 264, 404 (1821)). “[F]ederal courts ordinarily should entertain and resolve on \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 10 of 60    PageID #: 390\nthe merits an action within the scope of a jurisdictional grant, and should not ‘refuse \nto decide a case in deference to the States.’ ” Id. at 73 (quoting New Orleans Pub. \nServ., Inc. v. Council of the City of New Orleans (NOPSI), 491 U.S. 350, 368 (1989)).  \n  “Abstention is not in order simply because a pending state-court proceeding \ninvolves  the  same  subject  matter.”  Id.  at  72.  Only  “exceptional  circumstances” \nwarrant  deviation  from  the  general  rule  that  federal  courts  must  exercise  the \njurisdiction that is given to them. Id. at 78 (quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368). Those \nexceptional circumstances arise in three—and only three—contexts: (1) an ongoing \nstate criminal prosecution, (2) certain civil enforcement proceedings, and (3) “pending \n‘civil proceedings involving certain orders uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ \nability to perform their judicial functions.’ ” Id. (quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368).  \n  The first category (stemming from the facts of Younger itself) encompasses \nstate criminal prosecutions. See id. at 72. The second encompasses “state proceedings \n‘akin to a criminal prosecution’ in ‘important respects.’ ” Id. at 79 (quoting Huffman \nv. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592, 604 (1975)). Cases of this kind typically arise from an \ninvestigation that culminates in the filing of a formal complaint or charges by a state \nactor “to sanction the federal plaintiff, i.e., the party challenging the state action, for \nsome wrongful act.” Id. at 79–80.  \n  To illustrate the third category—“pending civil proceedings involving certain \norders uniquely in furtherance of the state courts’ ability to perform their judicial \nfunctions”—the Sprint Court cited to two cases: Juidice v. Vail, 430 U.S. 327, 336 \nn.12 (1977) (plaintiffs who were held in contempt by state court judges sought relief \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 11 of 60    PageID #: 391\nin federal court), and Pennzoil Co. v. Texaco, Inc., 481 U.S. 1, 13 (1987) (plaintiffs \nchallenged constitutionality of Texas bond provisions). See id. at 78–79. Both of those \ncases rested on the importance of the States being able to enforce the orders and \njudgments of their own courts. See id. at 79 (describing this category as “touch[ing] \non a state court’s ability to perform its judicial function”). Unlike cases involving the \nvalidity of a state court judgment, “it has never been suggested that Younger requires \nabstention  in  deference  to  a  state  judicial  proceeding  reviewing  legislative  or \nexecutive action. Such a broad abstention requirement would make a mockery of the \nrule that only exceptional circumstances justify a federal court’s refusal to decide a \ncase in deference to the States.” NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368. \n  The analysis as to whether Younger abstention is appropriate begins with \nexamining whether a particular state proceeding falls within one of these three \ndefined categories. Sirva, 794 F.3d at 192–93. If the state proceeding at issue does \n“fall[ ] within the Younger taxonomy,” the court next evaluates “whether the [so-\ncalled] Middlesex factors support abstention.” Id. at 193. That is, the court looks to \nwhether there is “an ongoing state judicial proceeding,” whether “the proceedings \nimplicate important state interests,” and whether “there is an adequate opportunity \nin the state proceedings to raise constitutional challenges.” Middlesex Cnty. Ethics \nComm. v. Garden State Bar Ass’n, 457 U.S. 423, 432 (1982). “[I]f these two steps leave \nthe case on track for abstention,” the court then looks to whether any of the limited \nexceptions to the Younger doctrine apply. Sirva, 794 F.3d at 193. \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 12 of 60    PageID #: 392\n  It is important to emphasize that Sprint narrowed the scope of Younger to the \nthree specified categories. Id. at 189. Previously, many lower courts treated the \nMiddlesex factors as the dispositive test, regardless of whether a case fell into one of \nthe three specified categories. Id. at 192. In Sprint, the Supreme Court clarified that \nthis was not correct, emphasizing that a strict application of the Middlesex factors \n“would extend Younger to virtually all parallel state and federal proceedings, at least \nwhere a party could identify a plausibly important state interest.” 571 U.S. at 81. The \nCourt noted that such a result is not consistent with its repeated admonition that \n“abstention from the exercise of federal jurisdiction is the ‘exception, not the rule.’ ” \nId. at 81–82 (quoting Midkiff, 467 U.S. at 236). \nB.  Maine’s Foster Care System \n  Maine law gives the Maine District Court jurisdiction over child protection \nproceedings. 22 M.R.S. § 4031(1)(A). As a part of these proceedings, the Maine \nDistrict  Court  makes  a  determination  as  to  whether  the  child  is  in  “jeopardy,” \nmeaning whether the child has been the victim of serious abuse or neglect. Id. \n§§ 4002(6), 4035. The court must review any case in which it has made a jeopardy \ndetermination at least once every six months, although the court or the child’s \nguardian ad litem may otherwise move for judicial review. Id. § 4038(1), (2). During \nsuch a review, the court must assess “[t]he safety of the child” and other factors \nregarding the placement of the child. Id. § 4038(5). \n  The Maine District Court has broad authority regarding what it can order in a \nchild protection proceeding, including “[n]ecessary emergency medical treatment for \nthe child” when the person who has custody of the child is unwilling or unable to \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 13 of 60    PageID #: 393\nconsent. See generally id. § 4036. DHHS, a doctor, or the chief medical administrator \nof a hospital may petition the court for a medical treatment order, and the court may \norder such treatment if it “is necessary to treat or prevent an immediate risk of \nserious injury.” Id. § 4071(1), (4). \nC.  Analysis \n  In arguing for abstention, the Defendants rely on the outdated Middlesex \nframework as being the dispositive test for whether abstention is appropriate. Defs.’ \nMot. 10–11. The cases cited by the Defendants—all of which pre-date Sprint—do the \nsame. See, e.g., 31 Foster Children v. Bush, 329 F.3d 1255, 1274–82 (11th Cir. 2003); \nJ.B. ex rel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1291 (10th Cir. 1999); Carson P. ex rel. \nForeman v. Heineman, 240 F.R.D. 456, 523 (D. Neb. 2007); Laurie Q. v. Contra Costa \nCnty., 304 F. Supp. 2d 1185, 1194 (N.D. Cal. 2004). The Supreme Court eschewed this \napproach in Sprint.5 See Sirva, 794 F.3d at 192.  \n  The  Plaintiffs  contend  that  periodic  individual  child  welfare  state  court \nproceedings do not fit within any of the three Younger abstention categories. Because \nthe Defendants address only the Middlesex factors—that is, step two of the three-step \nanalysis laid out in Sirva—they fail to address how the state proceedings fit into one \nof the three categories within the Younger taxonomy. See id. at 193. Even after the \nPlaintiffs clearly raised the issue in their response, the Defendants did not address \n \n5   The Defendants make a cursory “see also” cite to Sprint, but their analysis relies only on pre-\nSprint cases. See Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss FAC (“Defs.’ Mot.”) 11 (ECF No. 25). \n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 14 of 60    PageID #: 394\nthe question in their reply brief, continuing to rely exclusively on the Middlesex \nfactors. \n  Because the state proceedings are not criminal cases, there can be no argument \nthat the first Younger abstention category applies. Nor does this case fall into the \nsecond category, which involves quasi-criminal cases. As Justice Ginsburg explained \nin Sprint, the quasi-criminal category of cases “are characteristically initiated to \nsanction the federal plaintiff, i.e., the party challenging the state action, for some \nwrongful act.” 571 U.S. at 79. While it is true that a state-initiated proceeding to gain \ncustody of children allegedly abused by their parents could fall into this category,6 \nhere,  the  state  proceedings  are  beyond  the  custody  determination  and  are  not \nattempts to sanction a party by removing parental rights for some wrongful act. The \nparallel proceedings involving the Plaintiffs may involve periodic reviews by the state \ncourt,  but  they  lack  any  element  that  would  put  them  into  the  quasi-criminal \ncategory. See Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 771 F. Supp. 2d 142, 154 (D. Mass. \n2011) (holding that Younger abstention was not warranted where “[p]laintiffs’ claims \n \n6   The Defendants contend that Moore v. Sims, 442 U.S. 415 (1979) supports their contention \nthat abstention is required. Defs.’ Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss First Am. Compl. \n(“Defs.’ Reply”) 4 n.2 (ECF No. 42). But Moore is a very different type of case from this one. In Moore, \nparents brought suit in federal court after the state of Texas took temporary custody of their children \nfollowing a report of child abuse. 442 U.S. at 418–21. Notably, the Supreme Court found abstention to \nbe warranted because the State’s temporary removal of a child due to potential abuse was similar in \nkind to the pending criminal proceedings at issue in Younger. Id. at 423. That same pursuit of a state \nenforcement action occurring in the shadow of potential criminal conduct is lacking here. See M.B. ex \nrel. Eggemeyer v. Corsi, No. 2:17-cv-04102-NKL, 2018 WL 327767, at  *6 (W.D. Mo. Jan. 8, 2018) (“[T]he \noperative fact here is not that the juvenile court placed a given child into [state] custody, but that [the \nstate] has custody over the child . . . .”). \n \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 15 of 60    PageID #: 395\nrelate only to alleged injuries suffered while in [the Defendants’] custody”), aff’d, 774 \nF.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2014). \n  The  third  category  involves  federal  plaintiffs  seeking  to  undo  state  court \norders—such as a contempt or bond order—that are “uniquely in furtherance of the \nstate  courts’  ability  to  perform  their  judicial  functions.”  Sprint,  491  U.S.  at  78 \n(quoting NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368). The Defendants make no effort to explain how they \nwould fit into this category. The Defendants identify no existing state court order that \nthis case would interfere with, let alone any order that is “uniquely in furtherance of \nthe state courts’ ability to perform their judicial functions.” Id. This lawsuit is about \nthe care that the Plaintiffs are receiving in the Defendants’ custody; it has nothing to \ndo with the rightness or wrongness of any order of the Maine District Court or its \nauthority to adjudicate any matters in the Plaintiffs’ cases. See M.B. ex rel. Eggemeyer \nv. Corsi, No. 2:17-cv-04102-NKL, 2018 WL 327767, at *6 (W.D. Mo. Jan. 8, 2018); \nConnor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 155 (“Plaintiffs’ claims do not implicate the proceedings \nthemselves, only the aftermath of the proceedings.”); Sam M. ex rel. Elliott v. Chafee, \n800 F. Supp. 2d 363, 377 (D.R.I. 2011). “It is the executive’s actions that are being \nquestioned, not the power of the juvenile court.” M.B., 2018 WL 327767, at *6; accord \nKenny A. ex rel. Winn v. Perdue, 218 F.R.D. 277, 286 (N.D. Ga. 2003). And Younger \nhas no applicability where state court involvement is limited to a review of executive \naction. Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 154; see also NOPSI, 491 U.S. at 368 (explaining \nthat  requiring  Younger  abstention  “in  deference  to  a  state  judicial  proceeding \nreviewing legislative or executive action . . . would make a mockery of the rule that \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 16 of 60    PageID #: 396\nonly exceptional circumstances justify a federal court's refusal to decide a case in \ndeference to the States”). Because the Defendants fail to explain how they fit within \nany of the Younger categories, their argument for Younger abstention falters at step \none. \n  The Defendants contend that the Plaintiffs’ requested relief will interfere with \nthe Maine District Court’s ongoing review of the Plaintiffs’ cases, Defs.’ Mot. 11, but \nthey  fail  to  explain  why.  They  argue  that  their  administration  of  psychotropic \nmedications and their medical recordkeeping are “questions that are entrusted to the \nMaine  District  Court.”  Defs.’  Mot.  12  (citing  22  M.R.S.  §§  4036(1)(H),  4038; \nM.R.G.A.L. 4(c)(3), (6)–(7), (9)). But their cited statutes and rules do not speak to the \nMaine District Court’s authority to alter the Defendants’ recordkeeping practices or \nadministration of medicine. The statutes barely allude to the Maine District Court’s \nauthority in the realm of medical care, and their discussion of medical care only \npertains to emergency treatment. The Defendants identify no order issued in any of \nthe Plaintiffs’ cases—or, frankly, in the case of any foster child—pertaining to medical \nrecordkeeping  or  the  use  of  psychotropics  despite  the  alleged  pervasiveness  of \npsychotropics in foster care.7 \n  The Defendants fail to show how any order from this Court would interfere \nwith any existing or potential order in the State court. “It would be absurd to conclude \n \n7   A 2018 report by the Office of Inspector General for the United States Department of Health \nand Human Services found that 32.7% of the children in foster care in Maine—1,155 children—were \ntreated with psychotropic medications in fiscal year 2013.

Younger abstention applies. To so hold would mean that a \nfederal court would always have to abstain [in] any dispute related to a foster child \n[solely] because the juvenile court has continuing jurisdiction over the child.” M.B., \n2018 WL 327767, at *7; see also Rio Grande Cmty. Health Ctr., Inc. v. Rullan, 397 \nF.3d 56, 71 (1st Cir. 2005) (“[T]he mere possibility of inconsistent results in the future \nis insufficient to justify Younger abstention.”).  Moreover, the relief requested in this \ncase may well further the Maine District Court’s “own mission of ensuring that \nchildren removed from their parents’ custody because of abuse or neglect are not \nfurther harmed when the juvenile court orders them into the custody of the state.” \nKenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 286. \n  Finally, it is worth noting how different this case is from the cases relied on by \nthe Defendants.8 In 31 Foster Children, for example, the Eleventh Circuit found that \nthe plaintiffs’ requested relief would directly interfere with the plaintiffs’ juvenile \ncourt proceedings “by placing decisions that [were previously] in the hands of the \nstate courts under the direction of the federal district court.” 329 F.3d at 1278. The \nTenth Circuit came to a similar conclusion in J.B. 186 F.3d at 1292. That is not so \n \n8   The Defendants also complain that the Plaintiffs have not first raised these issues in state \ncourt. And they appear to accuse the Plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem of “withholding” information from \nthe Maine District Court “in anticipation of bringing federal litigation.” Defs.’ Reply 5–6. Even \nassuming the truth of this accusation, the Defendants identify no legal authority that says that claims \nthat can be raised in state court must be raised in state court prior to bringing a federal lawsuit. The \ncases that the Defendants cite in an effort to justify their grievance involve a failure to pursue an \nappeal,  see  Huffman  v.  Pursue,  Ltd.,  420  U.S.  592,  608  (1975),  and  a  failure  to  exhaust  an \nadministrative process, see Esso Standard Oil Co. v. Cotto, 389 F.3d 212, 221 (1st Cir. 2004); Maymó-\nMeléndez v. Álvarez-Ramírez, 364 F.3d 27, 34–35 (1st Cir. 2004). Defs.’ Mot. 14–15. Those cases have \nno application here. \n17 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 18 of 60    PageID #: 398\nhere. The Defendants fail to identify any decisions that the Plaintiffs are requesting \nthis Court to make that would normally be made by the Maine District Court. See \nKenny  A.,  218  F.R.D.  at  287–88  (distinguishing  31  Foster  Children—which was \nbinding precedent—based on the far-reaching relief the plaintiffs had requested in \nthat case and the potential for conflicting state and federal court orders if those \nrequests had been granted). As the Plaintiffs point out, numerous district courts have \nheld in cases challenging the administration of a state’s foster care system that \nYounger abstention is not appropriate,9 including the only case that either of the \nparties cite involving a state’s system of administering psychotropic drugs to foster \nchildren, see M.B., 2018 WL 327767, at *1, *6–7.10 \nII.  The Plaintiffs’ Next Friends \nA.  Legal Background \n  A minor plaintiff may bring a lawsuit in federal court through a representative, \nsuch as a guardian. Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c)(1)(A). “A minor . . . who does not have a duly \nappointed representative may sue by a next friend or by a guardian ad litem.” Id. \n17(c)(2). An individual’s capacity to represent a minor in federal court is governed by \nstate law. Sam M. ex rel. Elliott v. Carcieri, 608 F.3d 77, 86 (1st Cir. 2010). “The \n \n9   See, e.g., Tinsley v. McKay, 156 F. Supp. 3d 1024, 1034, 1041 (D. Ariz. 2015); Connor B. ex rel. \nVigurs v. Patrick, 771 F. Supp.2d 142, 156 (D. Mass. 2011), aff’d, 774 F.3d 45 (1st Cir. 2014); Sam M. \nex rel.

Supp. 662, 688 (S.D.N.Y. 1996), aff'd, 126 F.3d 372 (2d Cir. \n1997). \n10   The Defendants do not offer any way to distinguish M.B. and cite to it only once in a footnote \ndiscussing the Plaintiffs’ procedural due process claim. See Defs.’ Reply 10 n.8. \n18 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 19 of 60    PageID #: 399\nburden is on the ‘next friend’ clearly to establish the propriety of his status and \nthereby justify the jurisdiction of the court.” Whitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 164 \n(1990). \n  Typically, the authority and responsibilities of a guardian ad litem are limited \n“to child welfare and dependency matters brought before the court in which the \n[guardian ad litem] is appointed.” Sam M., 608 F.3d at 86 n.8. Where state law does \nnot confer general authority on a guardian ad litem to represent a child outside of \nfamily  court  proceedings,  the  guardian  ad  litem  is  not  considered  to  be  a \nrepresentative who can sue on behalf of a minor pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 17(c)(1). Id. at 87. However, a federal court can appoint a state-appointed \nguardian  ad  litem  as  an  unrepresented  child’s  representative  pursuant  to  Rule \n17(c)(2) if the guardian ad litem petitions the federal court to represent the child and \nthe court concludes that he/she is an appropriate next friend. Id. at 87 n.11. \n  In evaluating the suitability of a next friend for a foster child, the court should \nexamine whether the next friend is acting in good faith, is genuinely motivated to \nhelp the child seek relief, is familiar with the child’s situation, understands the role \nof a next friend, is able and willing to litigate on the child’s behalf, and is familiar \nwith the realities that foster children face. See id. at 92–94. The next friend need not \nhave a particularly close relationship with the child. See id. at 93–94 (allowing \nprofessor who studied child maltreatment to act as next friend for children whom he \nhad never met where it was apparent that he was knowledgeable about the issues \nand problems children face in foster care, he was familiar with what the plaintiffs \n19 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 20 of 60    PageID #: 400\nhad  been  through,  and  he  had  demonstrated  a  good  faith  desire  to  pursue  the \nchildren’s best interests). \nB.  Maine Law Pertaining to Guardians Ad Litem \n  The Maine District Court must appoint a guardian ad litem in most child \nprotection proceedings. 22 M.R.S. § 4005(1)(A). The guardian ad litem is obligated to \n“act in pursuit of the best interests of the child,” meaning in a way that prioritizes \nthe  child’s  safety  and  well-being.  Id.  §§  4002(1-C),  4005(1)(B).  To  fulfill  this \nobligation, the guardian ad litem must be given access to all relevant medical records \nof the child. Id. § 4005(1)(B). The guardian ad litem is also charged with providing \nbiannual reports to the Maine District Court “regarding the guardian ad litem’s \nactivities on behalf of the child and recommendations concerning the manner in \nwhich the court should proceed in the best interest of the child.” Id. The guardian ad \nlitem acts as an agent of the Maine District Court. Id. § 4005(1)(G). \n  Guardians  ad  litem  are  also  subject  to  various  rules  promulgated  by  the \nSupreme Judicial Court. See 4 M.R.S. § 1554(2). These rules “are designed to govern \nand define the services provided by guardians ad litem to the [Maine District Court] \nand to promote the best interests of the children whose interests they are appointed \nto represent.” M.R.G.A.L. 1(b).

Id. 4(c)(7)(E). The guardian ad litem must always act in the best interests \nof the child and must “exercise his or her independent judgment on behalf of the child \nin all relevant matters.” Id. 5(b).

Guardians ad litem must disclose \nto the Maine District Court if they are “a party to any case in court, other than in \n[their] capacity as a guardian ad litem.” Id. 5(i)(5). \nC.  Analysis \n  The Defendants raise seven objections to the Plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem \nserving as their next friends: (1) guardians ad litem act as agents of the Maine  \nDistrict Court; (2) their responsibilities are limited to proceedings in the appointment \norder, and they have no authority to act beyond the appointment order; (3) the duty \nof a guardian ad litem is to represent the best interests of the child, and their \nobligations as next friends will force them to violate that duty; (4) in order to comply \nwith their discovery obligations, the guardians ad litem will be forced to disclose \nconfidential information that they are prohibited from disclosing; (5) the interests of \nthe Named Plaintiffs may conflict with the interests of other members of the putative \nclass; (6) the guardians ad litem have not alleged that they have disclosed their \nparticipation in this lawsuit to the Maine District Court; and (7) the Next Friends \nhave not alleged that they have raised any of these issues in the Maine District Court. \nDefs.’ Mot. 15–18. \n21 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 22 of 60    PageID #: 402\n  At bottom, the Defendants misunderstand the role of the Next Friends in this \nCourt. While these three individuals happen to be the Plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem \nin their foster care proceedings, they are not acting as guardians ad litem in this case. \nThey are acting as the Plaintiffs’ next friends. To be sure, the Next Friends are \nqualified to serve as the Plaintiffs’ next friends because of their experience as the \nPlaintiffs’ guardians ad litem, but that does not mean that they are acting as the \nPlaintiffs’ guardians ad litem in this action. To put it differently, even if the Plaintiffs \nwere to get different guardians ad litem tomorrow, that would not change the ability \nof the Next Friends to serve as the Plaintiffs’ next friends in this litigation. \n  Rather, what matters is that all three be genuinely motivated to help the \nPlaintiffs seek relief, be familiar with the Plaintiffs’ situation, understand the role of \na next friend, be able and willing to litigate on the Plaintiffs’ behalf, and be familiar \nwith the realities that foster children face. It is apparent from the FAC and the \nPlaintiffs’ opposition that the Next Friends meet all of these criteria. The Defendants \ndispute none of this. \n  Most of the Defendants’ objections are rooted in the contention that the Next \nFriends are violating—or might violate—the Maine Rules for Guardians Ad Litem \n(“MRGAL”) in bringing this action. But the Defendants fail to explain what relevance \nthat has to their ability to act as the Plaintiffs’ next friends in this proceeding. If the \nNext Friends are in fact violating the MRGAL, the Defendants are free to raise this \nissue with the Maine District Court and to give it the opportunity to decide whether \nthe Next Friends remain suitable guardians ad litem. That is not something to be \n22 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 23 of 60    PageID #: 403\nlitigated here.11 The Defendants conflate federal law requirements to act as a next \nfriend (which govern in this Court) with state law requirements to act as a guardian \nad litem (which do not). \n  The only one of the Defendants’ arguments that is not based on the Next \nFriends’  purported  violations  of  the  MRGAL  is  the  contention  that  the  Named \nPlaintiffs’ interests might conflict with the interests of the putative class and that the \nNext Friends will not be able to represent all of the interests of the plaintiffs in the \nputative class. This objection is premature and is more properly made in response to \na motion to certify the putative class.12 \n \n11   It is worth noting, however, that it is not clear that the Plaintiffs’ next friends (“the Next \nFriends”) have violated—or are likely to violate—any of the Maine Rules for Guardians Ad Litem \n(“MRGAL”). First, the Defendants contend that because the Next Friends are agents of the Maine \nDistrict Court, they are acting against an entity to whom they owe a duty. That is not true. Guardians \nad litem are agents of the court, not the government. This action is against the State, not the Maine \nDistrict Court. \n  Second, the Defendants contend that the Next Friends might have to violate their duties to act \nin the best interests of the Plaintiffs by disclosing information in discovery even when it is not in the \nPlaintiffs’ best interests. This may be true, although it seems that the Plaintiffs’ guardians ad litem \nmight be subject to discovery even if they were not acting as Next Friends. Regardless, it may be the \ncase that this lawsuit is in the Plaintiffs’ best interests, regardless of what information might need to \nbe disclosed in discovery. And the ultimate duty of the guardians ad litem is to act in the best interests \nof the children they represent. \n  Third, although the MRGAL generally prohibit the release of confidential information, this \nonly extends to any person who is not a party to the case. As the Plaintiffs point out, any confidential \ninformation required to be disclosed in discovery will be disclosed to the Defendants, who are parties \nto the proceedings in the Maine District Court. Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Dismiss \n(“Pls.’ Opp’n”) 11–12 (ECF No. 36). In addition, this prohibition has exceptions for disclosures \nrequired by law, and disclosures in discovery would seem to fall within that category. \n  Fourth, the Defendants complain that the Plaintiffs have not alleged that the Next Friends \nnotified the Maine District Court that they were bringing this suit or that they have raised any of \nthese issues in Maine District Court. But the Plaintiffs were not required to make those allegations in \ntheir FAC, since they are not a component of any of their causes of action. It is unknown whether they \nhave provided any such information to the Maine District Court. It is also unknown whether the \nguardians ad litem have sufficient information about all of the Plaintiffs’ cases to petition the Maine \nDistrict Court, since the Plaintiffs allege that some of their guardians ad litem (e.g., in the cases of \nBryan and Trent) have been unable to obtain the Plaintiffs’ medical records. \n12   The Defendants also cite to an amicus brief filed in Sam M. by the National Association of \nCounsel for Children for the proposition that guardians ad litem may have unwaivable conflicts. Defs.’ \nMot. 17 (citing Br. for Nat’l Ass’n of Couns. for Child. et al. as Amici Curiae in Supp. of Pls.-Appellants \n23 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 24 of 60    PageID #: 404\n  “Important social interests are advanced by allowing minors access to a judicial \nforum to vindicate their constitutional rights through a Next Friend . . . particularly \nwhere, as here, the minors seek relief for alleged violations of the[ir] guardian’s duty \nto protect them.” Sam M., 608 F.3d at 91–92. The burden is on the Next Friends to \nprove their suitability, and I conclude that they have met their burden. I also note \nthat it is the Defendants who are in the best position to find someone to represent the \nPlaintiffs since they “effectively control the children’s lives as the children’s legal \ncustodian.” Id. at 88 n.12. It is difficult to think of who could better act as the \nPlaintiffs’ next friends than their guardians ad litem, and the Defendants do not \nidentify any alternatives.13 The Next Friends may permissibly act as next friends in \nthis lawsuit. \n \n(“NACC Brief”) at 10, Sam M. ex rel. Elliot v. Carcieri, 608 F.3d 77 (1st Cir. 2010) (No. 09-1759), 2009 \nWL 6809239, at *10). The Defendants take this argument out of context. This amicus brief was filed \nto argue that foster children should not be required to be represented by their state-appointed \nguardians ad litem in federal court because, for example, unwaivable conflicts may arise. NACC Brief \nat 28–30, 2009 WL 6809239, at *28–30. But the amicus brief acknowledges that a guardian ad litem \ncan sometimes be an appropriate representative for a foster child in federal court. NACC Brief at 19, \n30, 2009 WL 6809239, at *19, *30. \n13   The Defendants argue that a lack of a suitable next friend warrants dismissal for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, but the support for this proposition is thin. The three cases that the \nDefendants cite for support were all brought by next friends who were acting at odds with either the \nparty they were purporting to represent or that party’s legal guardian. In the first case, an activist \nsought to sue on behalf of two incompetent plaintiffs, each of whom had a natural guardian (for one, \nhis mother; for the other, her brother). Developmental Disabilities Advoc. Ctr., Inc. v. Melton, 689 F.2d \n281, 284–86 (1st Cir. 1982). Both guardians opposed the lawsuit. Id. at 285–86. Rule 17(c) of the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure only allows the appointment of a next friend if a minor or incompetent \nperson lacks a proper guardian, unless the interests of the guardian and the minor or incompetent \nplaintiff conflict. Id. The First Circuit affirmed the district court’s findings that the plaintiffs were \nadequately  represented  by  their  guardians,  who  opposed  the  lawsuit,  and  that  dismissal  was \nwarranted. Id. at 286. \n  In the second, the plaintiff sought to bring a lawsuit, pro se, on behalf of her mother.  Gibson-\nKennedy ex rel. Gibson v. Slutsky, Civ. No. 13-4324, 2014 WL 317871, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 29, \n2014), aff'd 650 F. App'x 122 (3d Cir. 2016). However, the Complaint was dismissed because not only \nwas the plaintiff not her mother’s guardian, but the court also found that a guardian cannot represent \nan incompetent adult without the assistance of counsel. Id. at *4. \n24 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 25 of 60    PageID #: 405\nIII.  Substantive Due Process \nA.  Legal Background \n  The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall “deprive any person \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, § 1. \n“[W]hen the State by the affirmative exercise of its power so restrains an individual’s \nliberty that it renders him unable to care for himself, and at the same time fails to \nprovide for his basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and \nreasonable safety—it transgresses the substantive limits on state action set by . . . \nthe Due Process Clause.” DeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. \n189, 200 (1989). “[I]t is the State’s affirmative act of restraining the individual’s \nfreedom to act on his own behalf” that creates the “deprivation of liberty” that triggers \nthe  protections  of  the  Due  Process  Clause.  Id.  “Whether  the  state  deprived  an \nindividual of ‘freedom to act on his own behalf,’ and is so subject to a correlative \n \n  In the third, a son, on behalf of his mother, sought to sue various defendants, including his \nmother’s guardian, alleging that his mother’s involuntary placement in a nursing home and the \nappointment of the guardian violated her constitutional rights. Bak v. Niagara Rehab. & Nursing Ctr., \nNo. 13-CV-215S, 2014 WL 297346, at *1–2 (W.D.N.Y. Jan. 27, 2014). The court was suspicious of the \ncomplaint, concluding that the son had named the guardian as a defendant in order to create a conflict \nof interest such that the guardian could not represent his mother in the lawsuit. Id. at *5. And the \ncourt was also suspicious of the fact that although the lawsuit was purportedly brought by the son to \nprotect his mother’s well-being, the lawsuit was seeking only monetary relief rather than injunctive \nor declaratory relief related to his mother’s well-being. Id. The court thus concluded that the son was \nnot motivated by a sincere desire to seek justice on his mother’s behalf and that he could not \npermissibly proceed as his mother’s next friend. Id. \n  It makes sense that a lawsuit would be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction where a person \npurporting to represent the plaintiff was acting antagonistically toward the plaintiff or her legal \nguardian and thus the plaintiff did not have a proper representative. This is analogous to a situation \nwhere one person files a lawsuit on behalf of another person without that person’s knowledge or \npermission. That lawsuit would, of course, be summarily dismissed. That is not the case here. The \nDefendants cite to no case where plaintiffs were represented by representatives who were acting in \ntheir best interest and the case was dismissed for lack of proper representation. \n  The short of it is that it cannot be the case that the Plaintiffs can be shut out of court merely \nbecause they are minors. There must be someone who can suitably represent each of the Plaintiffs, \nand their guardians ad litem appear to be in the best position to do so. \n25 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 26 of 60    PageID #: 406\nconstitutional  duty,  is  often  described  as  whether  a  ‘special  relationship’  exists \nbetween the state and the individual.” Connor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 774 F.3d \n45, 53 (1st Cir. 2014) (quoting J.R. v. Gloria, 593 F.3d 73, 79 (1st Cir. 2010) (quoting \nRivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir. 2005)) (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \n  The  First  Circuit  has  tread  lightly  when  faced  with  questions  involving \nsubstantive due process in the foster care context. See, e.g., id. at 52. It has assumed, \nwithout deciding, that a child’s entry into foster care creates a special relationship,14 \nand it has assumed arguendo that the special relationship of foster care requires a \nstate  to  provide,  among  other  things,  a  safe  living  environment  and  “care  and \ntreatment  through  the  exercise  of  accepted  professional  judgment.”  Id.  at  53.  I \nconclude  that  a  child’s  entry  into  foster  care  does  create  a  special  relationship \ntriggering at least some constitutional duty by the State to care for the children in its \ncustody.  \n  In Connor B., the First Circuit also sidestepped the question of what standard \napplies to a substantive due process claim in the foster care context. See id. at 54. The \ncourt explained that two different standards have arisen in evaluating substantive \n \n14   The unanimous consensus among the circuits is that a child’s entry into foster care does create \na relationship of constitutional significance. See Matican v. City of New York, 524 F.3d 151, 156 (2d \nCir. 2008); Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 808 (3d Cir. 2000); Doe ex rel. Johnson v. S.C.

Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982). See id. at 53–54. The First \nCircuit recognized that there might be some “tension” between the two tests but \ndecided that it did not need to reconcile these tests because it found that the plaintiffs \ncould not meet the Youngberg standard. See id. at 54.15 \n  The First Circuit has stated that the “shocks the conscience” test “governs all \nsubstantive due process claims based on executive . . . action.” Martínez v. Cui, 608 \nF.3d 54, 64 (1st Cir. 2010) (emphasis deleted). The “shocks the conscience” standard \nrequires an evaluation of “whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so \negregious,  so  outrageous,  that  it  may  fairly  be  said  to  shock  the  contemporary \nconscience.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 847 n.8. “In order to shock the conscience, the conduct \nmust be ‘truly outrageous, uncivilized, and intolerable.’ ” McConkie v. Nichols, 446 \nF.3d 258, 260 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Hasenfus v. LaJeunesse, 175 F.3d 68, 72 (1st \nCir. 1999)).  \n  “[C]onduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government \ninterest is the sort of official action most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking \n \n15   In the district court, the court had concluded that “to establish a substantive due process claim, \nPlaintiffs must show that Defendants’ conduct represented a substantial departure from accepted \nprofessional judgment, which deprived them of conditions of reasonable care and safety, and that such \nconduct shocks the conscience.” Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 163. Requiring proof of an absence of \nprofessional judgment makes sense because “administration of a foster care system is a matter of \nprofessional judgment . . . involving specialized expertise and professional norms.” Connor B., 774 F.3d \nat 54 n.10. And the Tenth Circuit has pointed out that there is not much difference between these two \nstandards in the foster care context. See Yvonne L. ex rel. Lewis v. N.M. Dep’t of Hum. Servs., 959 F.2d \n883, 894 (10th Cir. 1992).  \n27 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 28 of 60    PageID #: 408\nlevel.” Lewis, 523 U.S. at 849. Although the assessment is more difficult for conduct \nthat  is  not  intentional,  deliberately  indifferent  behavior  can  also  shock  the \nconscience. Id. at 849–52. A plaintiff can establish conscience-shocking deliberate \nindifference by showing that the state actor “knew of a substantial risk of serious \nharm  and  disregarded  that  risk”  in  a  situation  where  the  state  actor  had  the \nopportunity to make an unhurried judgment. Irish v. Fowler, 979 F.3d 65, 75 (1st Cir. \n2020). Deliberate indifference is most pronounced “where the state official performs \nmultiple acts of indifference” that collectively create a “risk of acute and severe \ndanger.”  Id.  This  analysis  is  necessarily  fact-intensive.  Lewis,  523  U.S.  at  850. \n“Deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently \negregious in another . . . .” Id.   \n  The “professional judgment” standard demands that a reviewing court “show \ndeference to the judgment exercised by a qualified professional.” Youngberg, 457 U.S. \nat 322. Decisions made by a professional are “presumptively valid” and may result in \nliability “only when the decision by the professional is such a substantial departure \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice, or standards as to demonstrate that \nthe person responsible actually did not base the decision on such a judgment.” Id. at \n323. “[A] substantial departure from accepted professional judgment may shock the \nconscience under some circumstances but not others.” Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at \n163.  \nB.  Analysis \n  In support of their substantive due process claim, the Plaintiffs have alleged \nthat  the  Defendants  are  facilitating  the  administration  of  potentially  harmful \n28 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 29 of 60    PageID #: 409\nmedications without consent or adequate medical justification and without ensuring \nsufficient oversight. The Plaintiffs allege serious deficiencies in informed consent, \nFAC ¶ 254, which is a fundamental aspect of medical care, see Woolley v. Henderson, \n418 A.2d 1123, 1128 n.3 (Me. 1980) (noting the fiduciary character of the physician-\npatient relationship). They allege that the Defendants have forced them to take \nmedications  to  which  they  have  expressed  their  opposition,  that  are  medically \nimproper, that are inappropriate for their age, and that are excessive in dosage and \nin  the  number  of  medications  administered.  The  Plaintiffs  also  allege  that  the \nDefendants are aware not only of the harms that have been caused to the individual \nPlaintiffs but also of the general harms caused by the Defendants’ administration of \npsychotropic drugs. FAC ¶¶ 210–16.  \n  The Plaintiffs further allege that the Defendants have provided caregivers and \nmedical providers with inaccurate medical records. See M.B., 2018 WL 327767, at \n*10. Failure to provide medical records to caregivers and medical providers means \nthat those charged with caring for the Plaintiffs are less aware of what drugs the \nPlaintiffs are taking, what side effects to look out for, and how to take care of that \nparticular child. FAC ¶¶ 70, 77 (describing how Trent was hospitalized following an \nacute crisis but the hospital lacked any medical records for him), 249.16 \n \n16   The Defendants argue that their conduct was per se constitutional because they relied on the \nprofessional judgment of doctors to diagnose the Plaintiffs and to prescribe them medications. This \nargument ignores the allegation that the Plaintiffs’ medical providers had inaccurate medical records. \nBecause the Plaintiffs have alleged that the Defendants failed to provide accurate medical records to \ntheir doctors, the Defendants cannot necessarily rely on the professional judgment of the allegedly ill-\ninformed doctors. \n29 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 30 of 60    PageID #: 410\n  The Defendants concede that the allegations the Plaintiffs make “are serious,” \nbut they contend that the allegations do not rise to the conscience-shocking level. \nDefs.’ Mot. 21. The Defendants have not persuaded me that as a matter of law the \nPlaintiffs cannot succeed. Rather the Defendants are asking me to assess the merits \nof the claim. Defs.’ Mot. 18 (“Complaint Fails on the Merits”).  At this stage, the \nPlaintiffs need only include allegations that state a plausible claim; they are not \nrequired  to  win  on  the  merits.  The  Plaintiffs’  allegations  plausibly  allege  a \nsubstantive due process claim regardless of whether the “shocks the conscience” or \n“professional judgment” standard (or both) applies.   \nIV.  Procedural Due Process \nA.  Legal Background \n  The procedural due process analysis is a two-step inquiry. The reviewing court \n“first  asks  whether  there  exists  a  liberty  or  property  interest  which  has  been \ninterfered with by the State.” González-Fuentes v. Molina, 607 F.3d 864, 886 (1st Cir. \n2010) (quoting Ky. Dep’t of Corrs. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 460 (1989)). The second \nquestion, then, is “whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were \nconstitutionally sufficient.” Id. (quoting Thompson, 490 U.S. at 460). As a part of \nanswering that second question, the Court balances three factors to determine what \nprocess is constitutionally due: (1) the private interests at issue, (2) the risk of an \nerroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used and the probable \nvalue of any additional or substitute procedural safeguards, and (3) the governmental \ninterests at stake. Haidak v. Univ. of Mass.-Amherst, 933 F.3d 56, 66 (1st Cir. 2019). \n“[T]he quantum and quality of the process due in a particular situation depend upon \n30 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 31 of 60    PageID #: 411\nthe need to serve the purpose of minimizing the risk of error.” Greenholtz v. Inmates \nof Neb. Penal & Corr. Complex, 442 U.S. 1, 13 (1979).  \nB.  Analysis \n  The Defendants argue that the FAC fails to state a viable procedural due \nprocess claim for three reasons. First, they contend that the Plaintiffs allege that they \nhave been deprived of a protected liberty interest in freedom from unnecessary \nadministration of psychotropic medications but that they have not alleged that they \nhave  been  “administered  unnecessary  medications.”  Defs.’  Mot.  23.  Second,  the \nDefendants contend that the Plaintiffs have failed to allege that any deprivation of \ntheir liberty interests is attributable to them. They point out that it is the medical \nprofessionals, not the Defendants, who are prescribing the medications allegedly in \nviolation of OCFS policy. Defs.’ Mot. 23–24. Finally, the Defendants argue that even \nif the Plaintiffs have alleged a deprivation of liberty attributable to them, the existing \nprocedures available under state law satisfy due process. Defs.’ Mot. 25.  \n  The Defendants’ first argument misrepresents the FAC, which fairly can be \nread to be asserting a liberty interest in “avoiding nonconsensual or unnecessary \nadministration of psychotropic medications.” Pls.’ Mem. of Law in Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. \nto Dismiss (“Pls.’ Opp’n”) 20 (ECF No. 36). Individuals have a significant liberty \ninterest in not being forced to take psychotropic drugs regardless of whether a \nmedical professional thinks that they are necessary.17 Washington v. Harper, 494 \n \n17   In Washington v. Harper, the Supreme Court weighed a prisoner’s right to refuse psychotropic \nmedications against the State’s interest in prison safety and security. See 494 U.S. 210, 214, 223 \n(1990).  The  Court  emphasized  that  the  prisoner’s  “interest  in  avoiding  the  unwarranted \nadministration of antipsychotic drugs [was] not insubstantial” because “[t]he forcible injection of \n31 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 32 of 60    PageID #: 412\nU.S. 210, 221–22 (1990). This, of course, includes foster children.18 See M.B., 2018 \nWL 327767, at *11; cf. Tamas v. Dep’t of Soc. & Health Servs., 630 F.3d 833, 847 (9th \nCir. 2010) (concluding that foster children have a protected liberty interest in a safe \nfoster care placement). This liberty interest is heightened where psychotropic drugs \nare being administered in a manner that is not medically appropriate and not for \npurposes of treatment. Cf. Harper, 494 U.S. at 222 n.8, 233.  \n  As to the Defendants’ argument that the Plaintiffs have not alleged that they \nhave been forced to take unnecessary medication, the Defendants miss the point. The \nFAC alleges that children in the foster care system from preschool to high school are \nbeing administered too many psychotropic medications and that they are receiving \nimproperly high dosages despite adverse side effects and the potential for dangerous \nlong-term effects. The FAC fairly alleges, therefore, that the Defendants are using \n \nmedication into a nonconsenting person’s body represents a substantial interference with that person’s \nliberty.” Id. at 229. In a later case, the Court concluded that “forcing antipsychotic drugs on a convicted \nprisoner is impermissible absent a finding of overriding justification and a determination of medical \nappropriateness.” Riggins v. Nevada, 504 U.S. 127, 135 (1992) (emphasis added). That is, once the \ndefendant in that case sought to terminate administration of the medication, it was incumbent upon \nthe state to establish not only the medical appropriateness of the medication, but also an “overriding \njustification” for it. See id.  In particular, the Riggins Court took issue with the district court’s failure \nto make any determination of need or to make any findings as to reasonable alternatives to forced \nmedication. Id. at 136. \n18   Not only do foster children have greater rights than the prisoners involved in Harper and \nRiggins, see Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 160; Yvonne L., 959 F.2d at 894, but the countervailing \nsecurity interest that exists in prisons or mental institutions is not at play in the foster care context. \nAnd while the Supreme Court has not examined the issue of forced administration of psychotropic \ndrugs in the foster care context, it has concluded that children have “a substantial liberty interest in \nnot being confined unnecessarily for medical treatment.” Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S. 584, 600 (1979). \nBecause involuntary confinement for purposes of medical treatment is analogous to the forced \nadministration of medication, it follows that children have an equally substantial interest in not being \nforcibly administered medication. \n32 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 33 of 60    PageID #: 413\nexcessive psychotropic drugs both across the purported class and as to the named \nPlaintiffs. \n  Further,  the  Plaintiffs  allege  that  the  Defendants  have  failed  to  use  an \nadequate  informed  consent  procedure,  that  they  did  not  have  a  say  in  the \nprescriptions  they  were  being  given,  and  that  they  were  not  given  sufficient \ninformation to provide informed consent. The liberty interest in not being forcibly \nadministered medication extends to medications about which the Plaintiffs or their \ncaretakers have been insufficiently informed (i.e., a lack of informed consent). See \nM.B., 2018 WL 327767, at *12.  \n  Turning to the Defendants’ second argument—that the deprivation is not \nattributable to the Defendants, since the psychotropic medications administered to \nthe Plaintiffs were prescribed by medical professionals—the Plaintiffs are alleging \nwidespread systemic failures in informed consent and the absence of secondary \nreview procedures that have as much to do with the Defendants as the medical \nproviders actually prescribing the medication. Further, the Plaintiffs allege that \nmedical providers have not been operating with sufficient information because they \nlack  up-to-date  medical  records.  This  alleged  information  void  is  also  directly \nattributable to the Defendants. “[E]ven if a fully informed physician’s assessment \nthat a child should be medicated might constitute sufficient process, [such process] \narguably cannot be sufficient” where “a full picture of the child’s medical history and \nsocial profile,” is absent. Id. Finally, I note the fact that a prescription does not take \ninto account the heightened risk of a caregiver acting against the best interests of the \n33 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 34 of 60    PageID #: 414\nchild by using medication to make the caregiver’s job easier rather than to address a \ngenuine medical need.19 Id. In other words, the Defendants’ participation in, and \nmotivations for, seeking these prescriptions are relevant, too. \n  As for the Defendants’ last argument—that the existing procedural protections \nare  constitutionally  sufficient—the  Defendants  rely  on  OCFS’s  policies,20  but, \nbecause the Plaintiffs allege multiple violations of these policies, their adequacy does \nnot carry the day. See Rodi v. Ventetuolo, 941 F.2d 22, 29 (1st Cir. 1991). \n \n19   The Supreme Court addressed this conflict in Parham in the course of its examination of \nGeorgia’s procedure for the involuntary institutionalization of children. The Court noted the potential \n“risk of error inherent in the parental decision to have a child institutionalized for mental health care” \nand  thus  determined  that  a  neutral  factfinder  was  required  to  assess  whether  the  statutory \nrequirements for admission had been satisfied, and to conduct periodic reviews thereafter. 442 U.S. at \n606. That risk is even greater in the foster care context where there is no natural bond of parental \naffection and where “the exigencies of accommodating numerous children with limited resources may \nincentivize medically unnecessary medication.” M.B., 2018 WL 327767, at *12. Critically, in Parham, \na single medical professional did not have the unbridled discretion whether to commit a child. See id. \n(citing Parham, 442 U.S. at 615). And in Harper, the Supreme Court mandated that the person \nultimately making the decision about what medication could be forcibly administered could not be \ninvolved in the inmate’s current diagnosis or treatment. See id. (citing Harper, 494 U.S. at 233). \nNeither safeguard appears to be present here. Rather, there is no indication that there is any check \non a doctor’s ability to prescribe any psychotropic medications requested by the Defendants before a \nchild is forced to take that medication. \n20   OCFS has a policy entitled “Authorization of the Use of Antipsychotic Medications for Youth \nin Foster Care” (the “Psychotropic Medication Policy”). OCFS Policy IV.A-C. This policy sets forth \nthat all youth in foster care “have the right to participate in all service decisions”; to “review their \ntreatment, case or service plan”; to “refuse any service unless mandated by law or court order”; and to \n“be informed about the consequences of refusal or disengagement with services.” Id. at 1. Pursuant to \nthe policy, antipsychotic medications may be “used only when clinically indicated,” and when they are \nused, their side effects must be properly monitored. Id. at 2. Administration of medication to youth \nfourteen and over without the consent of the youth is prohibited except in the event of imminent danger \nof bodily harm. Id. at 3. When a child moves to a new placement, the caseworker must identify for the \nnew care provider the medications the child is taking and who the prescribers are. Id. at 4. \n  The Psychotropic Medication Policy also outlines Maine’s Youth Bill of Rights, which provides \nthat foster children have the rights, among other things, to: have an informed choice in the type of \ncare received, see and understand treatment plans, have a say in treatment decisions, be informed \nabout medications and medication options, have a voice in decisions about prescription of medications, \nnot be overmedicated, not be punished for refusal to take medications, be made aware of possible risks \nthat come from refusing to take medications, and access medical records. Id. at 9. \n34 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 35 of 60    PageID #: 415\n  The Defendants also point to the judicial oversight by the Maine District Court, \nwhich they characterize as being “[c]ategorically . . . adequate process under the Due \nProcess [C]lause.” Defs.’ Mot. 25. But post-deprivation procedures such as judicial \noversight may be inadequate if “the state is in a position to provide for predeprivation \nprocess.” San Geronimo Caribe Project, Inc. v. Acevedo-Vila, 687 F.3d 465, 479 (1st \nCir. 2012) (en banc) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 534 (1984)). “Whether \nthe opportunity [for due process] needs to be furnished before the seizure or whether \na post-seizure opportunity is sufficient depends on the circumstances.” Herwins v. \nCity of Revere, 163 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1998). “Where feasible, the opportunity (for \nobvious  reasons)  is  expected  to  be  pre-deprivation  .  .  .  .”  Id.  Post-deprivation \nopportunity is only sufficient where quick action is required or where the provision of \nany meaningful pre-deprivation process is impractical. Id. The Defendants make no \nargument that pre-deprivation process is not possible here. \n  The Plaintiffs have adequately alleged a violation of their procedural due \nprocess rights. Contrary to the Defendants’ claim that the issue is a question of law, \nDefs.’ Reply Mem. in Further Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss First Am. Compl. 9 (ECF No. \n42), the adequacy of the existing procedural safeguards is at least a mixed question \nof law and fact. Issues such as whether there is a substantial interference with a \nliberty interest, the risks of erroneous deprivation, and the value of additional or \nalternative procedures are fact-based. The Defendants repeatedly invoke Connor B. \nin an attempt to shore up their claims, but the Plaintiffs in Connor B. had the benefit \nof discovery and actually were allowed to present their entire case during a bench \n35 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 36 of 60    PageID #: 416\ntrial. See 774 F.3d at 48. At this stage in the proceedings, I take the allegations as \ntrue and draw all inferences in favor of the Plaintiffs, who need only state a plausible \nclaim, which they have done. The motion to dismiss the procedural due process claim \nis therefore denied.  \nV.  AACWA \nA.  Legal Background \n1.  AACWA \n  Pursuant to the AACWA, a state is eligible for federal funding for its foster \ncare system if it meets particular requirements established by Congress. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 671(a). As relevant here: \nIn order for a State to be eligible for [such] payments . . . it shall have a \nplan approved by the Secretary which— \n(16) provides for the development of a case plan . . . for each [foster] child . . . \nand  provides  for  a  case  review  system  which  meets  the  [statutory \nrequirements] with respect to each child. \n \nId. § 671(a)(16). \n  The statutory requirements for what must comprise a case plan and a case \nreview system are numerous and lengthy, but I highlight in abbreviated fashion the \ncomponents that are most important to my analysis: \n(1) The term “case plan” means a written document which . . . includes \nat least the following: \n(A) A description of the type of home or institution in which a child is to \nbe placed, including a discussion of the safety and appropriateness of \nthe placement . . . . \n \n(B) A plan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper care and \nthat services are provided to the parents, child, and foster parents in \norder to improve the conditions in the parents’ home, facilitate return of \n36 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 37 of 60    PageID #: 417\nthe child to his own safe home or the permanent placement of the child, \nand address the needs of the child while in foster care, including a \ndiscussion of the appropriateness of the services that have been provided \nto the child under the plan . . . . \n \n(C) The health and education records of the child, including the most \nrecent information available regarding— \n \n    (i) the names and addresses of the child’s health and educational \nproviders; \n     \n    (ii) the child’s grade level performance; \n \n(iii) the child’s school record; \n \n(iv) a record of the child’s immunizations; \n \n(v) the child’s known medical problems; \n \n(vi) the child’s medications; and \n \n(vii)  any  other  relevant  health  and  education  information \nconcerning the child determined to be appropriate by the State \nagency. \n \n(D) For a child who has attained 14 years of age or over, a written \ndescription of the programs and services which will help such child \nprepare for the transition from foster care to a successful adulthood. \n \n(E) In the case of a child with respect to whom the permanency plan is \nadoption or placement in another permanent home, documentation of \nthe steps the agency is taking to find [a suitable placement]. At a \nminimum, such documentation shall include child specific recruitment \nefforts . . . . \n \n(F) In the case of a child with respect to whom the permanency plan is \nplacement with a relative . . . a description of— \n \n    (i) the steps the agency has taken to determine that it is not \nappropriate for the child to be returned home or adopted; \n     \n    (ii) the reasons for any separation of siblings during placement; \n \n37 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 38 of 60    PageID #: 418\n(iii) the reasons why a permanent placement with a fit and willing \nrelative  . . . is in the child’s best interests; \n \n. . . \n \n(G) A plan for ensuring the educational stability of the child while in \nfoster care, including— \n \n    (i) assurances that each placement of the child in foster care takes \ninto  account  the  appropriateness  of  the  current  educational \nsetting and the proximity to the school in which the child is \nenrolled at the time of placement; and \n     \n    (ii) \n(I) an assurance that the State agency has coordinated with \nappropriate local educational agencies . . . to ensure that \nthe  child  remains  in  the  school  in  which  the  child  is \nenrolled at the time of each placement; or \n \n(II) if remaining in such school is not in the best interests \nof the child, assurances . . . to provide immediate and \nappropriate enrollment in a new school, with all of the \neducational records of the child provided to the school. \nId. § 675(1). \n \nThe case plan for any child in foster care under the responsibility of the State \nwho has attained 14 years of age shall [also] include— \n \n(1) a document that describes the rights of the child with respect to \neducation, health, visitation, and court participation, the right to be \nprovided with the documents specified in section 675(5)(I) of this title in \naccordance  with  that  section,  and  the  right  to  stay  safe  and  avoid \nexploitation; and \n \n(2)  a  signed  acknowledgment  by  the  child  that  the  child  has  been \nprovided a copy of the document and that the rights contained in the \ndocument have been explained to the child in an age-appropriate way. \n \nId. § 675a(b). \n \n  The term “case review system” means a procedure for assuring that— \n \n(A) each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in a safe \nsetting  that  is  the  least  restrictive  (most  family  like)  and  most \n38 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 39 of 60    PageID #: 419\nappropriate setting available and in close proximity to the parents’ \nhome, consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child, \nwhich— \n \n(i) if the child has been placed [somewhere] a substantial distance \nfrom the home of the parents of the child . . . sets forth the reasons \nwhy such placement is in the best interests of the child, and \n \n(ii) if the child has been placed in foster care outside the State in \nwhich the home of the parents of the child is located, requires \nthat, periodically, but not less frequently than every 6 months, a \ncaseworker . . . visit such child in such home or institution and \nsubmit a report on such visit . . . , \n \n(B) the status of each child is reviewed periodically but no less frequently \nthan once every six months by either a court or by administrative review \n. . . in order to determine the safety of the child, the continuing necessity \nfor and appropriateness of the placement, the extent of compliance with \nthe case plan, and the extent of progress which has been made toward \nalleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster \ncare, and to project a likely date by which the child may be returned to \nand  safely  maintained  in  the  home  or  placed  for  adoption  or  legal \nguardianship, and, for a child for whom another planned permanent \nliving arrangement has been determined as the permanency plan, the \nsteps the State agency is taking to ensure the child’s foster family home \nor child care institution is following the reasonable and prudent parent \nstandard  and  to  ascertain  whether  the  child  has  regular,  ongoing \nopportunities to engage in age or developmentally appropriate activities \n. . . ; \n \n. . . \n \n(D) a child’s health and education record . . . is reviewed and updated, \nand a copy of the record is supplied to the foster parent or foster care \nprovider with whom the child is placed . . . ; [and] \n \n. . . \n \n(I) each child in foster care under the responsibility of the State who has \nattained 14 years of age receives without cost a copy of any consumer \nreport . . . pertaining to the child each year until the child is discharged \nfrom care, receives assistance . . . in interpreting and resolving any \ninaccuracies in the report, and, if the child is leaving foster care . . . is \nnot discharged from care without being provided with . . . an official or \n39 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 40 of 60    PageID #: 420\ncertified copy of the United States birth certificate of the child, a social \nsecurity card issued by the Commissioner of Social Security, health \ninsurance  information,  a  copy  of  the  child’s  medical  records,  and  a \ndriver’s license or identification card issued by a State . . . and any \nofficial documentation necessary to prove that the child was previously \nin foster care. \n \nId. § 675(5). \n  Section 622 then provides that in order to be eligible for funding, “a State must \nhave  a  plan  for  child  welfare  services”  that  meets  a  number  of  requirements, \nincluding that the plan “provides assurances that the State . . . is operating, to the \nsatisfaction of the Secretary . . . a case review system . . . for each child” in foster care. \nId. § 622(a), (b)(8)(A)(ii). \n2.  Private Causes of Action \n  Legislation enacted pursuant to Congress’s spending power typically does not \nallow for a private cause of action in the event of noncompliance. Pennhurst State \nSch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 28 (1981). Rather, the appropriate remedy is \nfor the federal government to terminate the funds to the state violating the statute. \nId. However, if the statute does provide for an enforceable right, a plaintiff can sue to \nenforce that right pursuant to § 1983. Id. \n  Assessing whether a statute may be enforceable under § 1983 begins with the \nquestion of whether Congress intended for that statute to create an individual right. \nSee Colón-Marrero v. Vélez, 813 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2016). Congress’s intention to \ncreate  an  individual  right  is  apparent  if  three  conditions  are  met.  Blessing  v. \nFreestone,  520  U.S.  329,  340–41  (1997);  Colón-Marrero,  813  F.3d  at  17.  “First, \nCongress must have intended that the provision in question benefit the plaintiff.” \n40 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 41 of 60    PageID #: 421\nColón-Marrero, 813 F.3d at 17 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340). This “requires \nmore than a showing that the plaintiff is an intended beneficiary of the statute or \n‘within the general zone of interest that the statute is intended to protect.’ ” Id. \n(quoting Gonzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 283 (2002)). “Rather, ‘the plaintiff must \ndemonstrate that the federal statute creates an individually enforceable right in the \nclass of beneficiaries to which he belongs.’ ” Id. (quoting City of Rancho Palos Verdes \nv. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113, 120 (2005)). Even where language merely “directs state \nofficials in the implementation of statutory objectives,” such language can “still create \nan enforceable right where it ‘mentions a specific, discrete beneficiary group within \nthe statutory text’ and ‘speaks in individualistic terms, rather than at the aggregate \nlevel of institutional policy or practice.’ ” Id. at 17–18 (quoting Rio Grande, 397 F.3d \nat 74). \n  “Second, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the right assertedly protected by \nthe statute is not so vague and amorphous that its enforcement would strain judicial \ncompetence.” Id. at 17 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 340–41). “[S]pecificity” can help \nto “shield[ ] against potentially disparate outcomes, bolstering the conclusion that the \nlanguage is rights-creating.” Id. at 20. \n  “Third, the statute must unambiguously impose a binding obligation on the \nStates.” Id. at 17 (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341). “In other words, the provision \ngiving rise to the asserted right must be couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, \nterms.” Id. (quoting Blessing, 520 U.S. at 341). \n41 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 42 of 60    PageID #: 422\n  If a plaintiff “demonstrates that Congress intended to confer an individual \nright, the right is presumptively enforceable by § 1983.” Id. at 16. To rebut that \npresumption, it is incumbent upon the defendant to “show that Congress ‘shut the \ndoor to private enforcement either expressly’ in the statute creating the right, ‘or \nimpliedly, by creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that is incompatible with \nindividual enforcement under § 1983.’ ” Id. (quoting Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. \n275, 284 n.4 (2001)). The burden to overcome the presumption of enforceability is a \n“difficult” one. Blessing, 520 U.S. at 346. \n  Evaluating whether a statute provides for a private cause of action requires \nthe plaintiff “to identify with particularity the rights” claimed, rather than looking at \nthe statute “as an undifferentiated whole.” Id. at 342. Thus, this framework must \nseparately be applied to each identified right in a statute. See id. \n3.  Private Causes of Action in the AACWA Context \n  The Plaintiffs’ AACWA claim partially relies on the notion that 42 U.S.C. \n§ 671(a)(16)—the AACWA’s case plan requirement—creates a private cause of action. \nClose to forty years ago, the First Circuit examined this exact question. See Lynch v. \nDukakis, 719 F.2d 504, 506 (1st Cir. 1983). In doing so, the First Circuit noted the \nSupreme  Court’s  repeated  conclusion  (prior  to  1983)  that  rights  under  various \nprovisions of the Social Security Act (“SSA”) are enforceable and that remedies under \nthe SSA are exclusive only when the SSA expresses such an intent. Id. at 510. The \ncourt also rejected the defendants’ arguments that a private cause of action would \nweaken the enforcement discretion of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health \n42 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 43 of 60    PageID #: 423\nand Human Services (the “Secretary”) or that the Secretary’s ability to withhold \nfunding  precluded  a  private  cause  of  action.  Id.  at  511.  Ultimately,  the  court \nconcluded that a private cause of action could be brought pursuant to § 1983 to enforce \nthe case plan requirement in § 671(a)(16). Id. at 512; see Suter v. Artist M., 503 U.S. \n347, 354 n.5 (1992) (noting—but not opining on—Lynch’s holding). \n  But Lynch is not dispositive because the governing law, both in the context of \nprivate causes of action in general  and in the context of private causes of action under \nthe AACWA specifically, has changed.21 Notably, a decade after Lynch, the Supreme \nCourt analyzed a neighboring provision of the AACWA, § 671(a)(15). That provision \nrequires states to “have a plan approved by the [federal government] which . . . \n \n21   The Plaintiffs contend that Lynch settles the issue as to whether the case plan and case review \nrequirements are privately enforceable. Pls.’ Opp’n 26–27. I disagree, but not for the same reasons as \nthe Defendants. The Defendants contend that Lynch analyzed other case plan requirements than the \none at issue here and contend that “other case plan requirements in the [Adoption Assistance and \nChild Welfare Act (“AACWA”)] remain subject to evaluation.” Defs.’ Reply 11. \n  I recognize that Blessing requires that statutes be analyzed piece by piece rather than being \nexamined “as an undifferentiated whole.” Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 342 (1997). But I do not \nunderstand this to mean that each case plan or case review system requirement must be analyzed \nindependently to establish whether it can support a private cause of action. This is because each of \nthese components comprises the definition of “case plan” and “case review system.” It does not make \nsense to subdivide these definitions because, by definition, if any component is lacking, it is not a “case \nplan” or a “case review system,” since each term is defined by the entirety of its parts. In my view, then, \nthe question is whether a private cause of action can be brought based on the idea that a state’s case \nplan (in general) or case review system (in general) is deficient because it is lacking in some way. In \nother words, the question is whether the case plan and case review system requirements are privately \nenforceable, not whether it is privately enforceable to have each component of a case plan or case \nreview system. As the Defendants emphasize, § 671 is merely definitional. It is § 675(a) that does or \ndoes not establish the right, and § 671 only serves to flesh out what some of the words in § 675(a) \nmean. \n  Having said this, I do not view Lynch as dispositive. While it has not been overruled, and its \nholding might remain good law, the analysis in Lynch is outdated. It appears to skip the first part of \nthe so-called Blessing/Gonzaga framework (i.e., the modern approach to evaluating the existence of a \nprivate right of action) and jumps right to asking whether Congress intended to foreclose a § 1983 \nremedy before examining whether Congress intended to create a federal right. See Lynch v. Dukakis, \n719 F.2d 504, 512 (1st Cir. 1983) (“[N]othing in the language or structure of Title IV-E suggests that \nCongress meant section 671(b) to be an exclusive remedy . . . .”). I thus question the continuing vitality \nof Lynch and do not think its holding can be extrapolated to new fact patterns like the one at issue \nhere. \n43 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 44 of 60    PageID #: 424\nprovides that, in each case, reasonable efforts will be made (A) prior to the placement \nof a child in foster care, to prevent or eliminate the need for removal of the child from \nhis home, and (B) to make it possible for the child to return to his home.” Suter, 503 \nU.S. at 351 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(15)). The Suter plaintiffs brought a class \naction  alleging  that  the  Illinois  Department  of  Children  and  Family  Services \n(“DCFS”) failed to promptly assign caseworkers to children placed in DCFS custody \nand that DCFS thereby failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent removal and to \nfacilitate reunification of families, in violation of § 671(a)(15). Id. at 352. \n  The Court recognized that § 671(a)(15) was mandatory by its terms but found \nthat the statute only mandated the states to have a plan containing the listed features \napproved  by  the  federal  government.  Id.  at  358.  That  is,  the  Court  found  that \n§ 671(a)(15) only guaranteed the existence of the plan, not the implementation of the \nplan. See id. at 358–59. This is in contrast to the Supreme Court’s prior rejection of \nthis same line of reasoning in another case just two years earlier in which the Court \nhad taken a broader approach in analyzing the existence of a private right of action. \nSee Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496 U.S. 498, 513–14 (1990).22 \n \n22   In that case, Wilder v. Virginia Hospital Association, the Supreme Court analyzed whether a \nhealthcare provider could sue pursuant to § 1983 to challenge the reimbursement method of a state \n(in that case, Virginia) under the Medicaid Act. 496 U.S. 498, 501 (1990). The Medicaid Act required \nstates to submit a “plan for medical assistance” to be approved by the Secretary of the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services (the “Secretary”). Id. at 502 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)). And that \nplan was required to provide payments that “the State finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the \nSecretary, are reasonable and adequate to meet the costs” of a facility’s provision of care. Id. at 502–\n03 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A)) (emphasis deleted). Virginia tried to argue that the statute’s \nrequirements were mere procedural requirements and that it was not required to adopt rates that \nwere actually found to be reasonable and adequate but that the statute only required states to satisfy \nthemselves that their rates were “reasonable and adequate and to make assurances to that effect to \nthe Secretary.” Id. at 512–13. The Court rejected that argument, finding that that “would render the \nstatutory requirements of findings and assurances, and thus the entire reimbursement provision, \nessentially meaningless.” Id. at 514. And the Court ultimately held—adopting a similar framework to \n44 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 45 of 60    PageID #: 425\n  The  Suter  court  also  concluded  that  the  AACWA  gave  the  states  broad \ndiscretion in deciding how to comply with the directive in § 671(a)(15). See 503 U.S. \nat 360. And the Court concluded that the statute lacked sufficient “guidance . . . as to \nhow ‘reasonable efforts’ [were] to be measured.” Id. Rather than a private cause of \naction, the Court concluded that the remedy for a violation of § 671(a)(15) was for the \nSecretary to reduce or eliminate payments if he/she were to find that a state’s plan \nfailed to comply with the statute or that a state failed to comply with its established \nplan. Id. \n  This  decision  was  met  with  backlash.  Congress  was  concerned  that \n“beneficiaries of the State plan titles of the” SSA—meaning those aspects of the SSA \nrequiring states to develop specific plans to implement federal programs, such as the \nAACWA —would not be able to sue to ensure that these plans complied with the SSA. \nH.R. Rep. No. 102-631, at 365 (1992). Congress was also concerned that Suter would \naffect not just the enforceability of the AACWA, but also the ability of beneficiaries \nof all federal programs with state plan requirements (e.g., Medicaid, Unemployment, \netc.) to sue to enforce state violations of those federal programs. Id. And Congress \nalso noted that the Supreme Court’s pre-Suter case law “recognized, in a substantial \nnumber of decisions” (such as Wilder) “that beneficiaries of Federal-State programs \ncould seek to enjoin State violations of Federal statu[t]es by suing under 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1983.” Id. at 364.  \n \nthat of Blessing and Gonzaga—that healthcare providers could use a private right of action to sue to \nenforce the outlined reimbursement requirements. See id. \n45 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 46 of 60    PageID #: 426\n  Based  on  those  concerns,  Congress  swiftly  responded  with  legislation \ncolloquially known as the “Suter fix.” Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 168 n.9. That \nstatute says: \nIn an action brought to enforce a provision of this chapter, such provision \nis not to be deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section of \nthis chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the required contents \nof a State plan. This section is not intended to limit or expand the \ngrounds for determining the availability of private actions to enforce \nState plan requirements other than by overturning any such grounds \napplied in Suter v. Artist M., 112 S. Ct. 1360 (1992), but not applied in \nprior Supreme Court decisions respecting such enforceability; provided, \nhowever, that this section is not intended to alter the holding in Suter \nv. Artist M. that section 671(a)(15) of this title is not enforceable in a \nprivate right of action. \n42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2. \n  In enacting the Suter fix, Congress sought to turn back the clock, “to restore to \nan aggrieved party the right to enforce . . . the Federal mandates of the State plan \ntitles of the” SSA as it existed prior to Suter (i.e., in Wilder). H.R. Rep. No. 102-631, \nat 365. In other words, Congress sought to “preserve[ ] private rights of action as they \nexisted before” Suter and “to assure that individuals who have been injured by a \nstate’s failure to comply with . . . state plan requirements [would be] able to seek \nredress in the federal courts to the extent they were able to prior to” Suter. Id. at 366. \nCongress  did  not,  however,  seek  to  overturn  the  specific  holding  of  Suter  that \n§ 671(a)(15) was too vague to be judicially enforceable. Id. Rather, Congress only \nsought to alter the aspect of Suter “suggesting that failure of a state to comply with a \nstate plan provision is not litigable as a violation of federal statutory rights.” Id. \n   \n46 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 47 of 60    PageID #: 427\n  “[A]lthough Congress did not overrule Suter . . . it made clear that the inclusion \nof a requirement as part of a state plan was not sufficient to render that requirement \nunenforceable by private action.” L.J. v. Wilbon, 633 F.3d 297, 309 (4th Cir. 2011); \naccord Charlie H. v. Whitman, 83 F. Supp. 2d 476, 484 (D.N.J. 2000). Courts have \nthus interpreted the Suter fix to overrule the “portion of the opinion identifying and \nallowing a court to rely exclusively on the state plan criteria in determining the \nexistence of a federal right.” Sam M., 800 F. Supp. 2d at 386 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted); see also Olivia Y. ex rel. Johnson v. Barbour, 351 F. Supp. 2d 543, \n559–60 (S.D. Miss. 2004). \nB.  Analysis \n  The Plaintiffs argue that two provisions of the AACWA can support a private \ncause  of  action:  §§  671(1)(a)(16)  and  622(b)(8)(A)(ii).  Pls.’  Opp’n  25–26.  The \nDefendants dispute this and also argue that even if these private causes of action are \nviable, the Plaintiffs’ AACWA claim fails on the merits. I begin with the question of \nwhether these provisions provide for a private cause of action. \n1.  Private Cause of Action \na.  Section 671(a)(16) \ni.  Intent to Benefit \n  Section  671(a)(16)  requires  states  to  include  in  their  foster  care  plans \nprovisions for the development of a “case plan . . . for each [foster] child” and for a \n“case review system . . . with respect to each . . . child.” From this language alone it \nis apparent that the “case plan” and “case review system” requirements are intended \n47 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 48 of 60    PageID #: 428\nto benefit “each child” (i.e., individual foster children). Sam M., 800 F. Supp. 2d at \n387–88; Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 171; Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 292. This \ncongressional intent to benefit foster children is made more apparent by looking \nthrough these terms of art to their statutory definitions. \n  The statutory requirements for what comprise a “case plan” contain no fewer \nthan eight components that are focused directly on, and clearly intended to benefit, \nindividual foster children.23 The description of the “case review system” is similarly \nchild-focused, as at least four components of that system are focused directly on, and \nclearly intended to benefit, individual foster children.24 The required components of \nthe case plan and the case review system speak in individualized terms rather than \n \n23   See 42 U.S.C. § 675(1)(A) (“a discussion of the safety and appropriateness” of the child’s \nplacement), (B) (“[a] plan for assuring that the child receives safe and proper care and that services \nare provided to . . . address the needs of the child while in foster care”), (C) (inclusion of all “relevant \nhealth and education information concerning the child”), (D) (for children over fourteen, description of \nprograms and services that will help them prepare for transition to adulthood), (E) (documentation of \nsteps agency is taking to find a suitable placement for the child, including “child specific recruitment \nefforts”), (F) (for children placed with a relative, explanations for why child should not be returned \nhome or adopted, why the child is separated from any siblings, and why the placement “is in the child’s \nbest  interests”),  (G)  (“[a]  plan  for  ensuring  the  educational  stability  of  the  child,”  including \nconsideration of the proximity of the child’s placement to the child’s current school, and a requirement \nthat school placement must be “in the best interests of the child”); id. § 675a(b)(1) (for children over \nfourteen, case plan must describe the child’s rights, including “the right to stay safe and avoid \nexploitation”),  (2) (children  over  fourteen  must  sign  an  acknowledgment  they  have  been  given \ndocumentation reflecting these rights and have had them explained “in an age-appropriate way”). \n24   See 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(A) (placement must be “in a safe setting that is the least restrictive \n(most family like) and most appropriate setting available and in close proximity to the parents’ home, \nconsistent with the best interest and special needs of the child,” and more distant placements must be \n“in the best interests of the child,” while out-of-state placements require a caseworker to visit the child \nperiodically and to submit a report), (B) (“status of the child” must be reviewed at least every six \nmonths to evaluate “safety of the child,” appropriateness of the placement, and “whether the child has \nregular,  ongoing  opportunities  to  engage  in  age  or  developmentally  appropriate  activities”), \n(D) (“child’s health and education record” must be “reviewed and updated” and “supplied to” the child’s \ncustodian), (I) (children over fourteen must receive copies of reports and assistance in interpreting and \nresolving  inaccuracies,  while  children  leaving  foster  care  must  receive  particular \ndocuments/information). \n \n48 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 49 of 60    PageID #: 429\nin terms of institutional policy or practice as a whole. It is apparent from the language \nused that the statute is primarily concerned with the interests of the individual \nchildren in foster care. M.B., 2018 WL 327767, at *15; Elisa W. ex rel. Barricelli v. \nCity of New York, No. 15 CV 5273-LTS-HBP, 2016 WL 4750178, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. \n12, 2016); Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 292; Brian A. ex rel. Brooks v. Sundquist, 149 F. \nSupp. 2d 941, 947 (M.D. Tenn. 2000); cf. Colón-Marrero, 813 F.3d at 19 (noting that \n“no gap exists between the operative text . . . and the persons whose interests are at \nstake”  where  “[t]he  statutory  proscription  .  .  .  directly  and  explicitly  protects \nindividual voters”). \n  The Defendants provide four arguments as to why they believe § 671(a)(16) \ndoes not satisfy the “intent to benefit” prong of the test. Defs.’ Mot. 30–31. First, the \nDefendants contend that the statute is “not unambiguously structured to benefit \nindividual claimants” since it “is enforced by the Secretary.” Defs.’ Mot. 30. This \nmisunderstands the structure of the statute. While the plan must be approved by the \nSecretary, the focus of § 671(a)(16) is on ensuring that the plan contains each of the \nlisted components. The two components at issue—the case plan and case review \nsystem—have numerous sub-components clearly intended to benefit individual foster \nchildren.25 \n \n25   The Defendants implicitly acknowledge that at least part of the AACWA’s case review system \nis intended to benefit individual foster children. They note how, under Maine law, the Maine District \nCourt must review foster children’s cases at least every six months. Defs.’ Mot 2, 11, 17, 25. And they \nhighlight this as a child-protective aspect of Maine’s foster care system. See Defs.’ Mot. 17–18 \n(explaining that guardians ad litem can raise issues with child’s care with Maine District Court at \nleast every six months), 25 (“In instances where these [procedural] safeguards fail, the child and/or \n[guardian ad litem] can bring their concerns to the Maine District Court overseeing their child \nprotective case . . . even outside the regular six-month review period.”). The requirement that reviews \nbe held at least every six months is mandated by the AACWA. See 42 U.S.C. § 675(5)(B). It cannot be \n49 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 50 of 60    PageID #: 430\n  The  Defendants’  interpretation  mostly  ignores  §  675(1)  and  (5),  focusing \nexclusively on § 671(a)(16). But “case plan” and “case review system,” as used in \n§ 671(a)(16), are defined phrases, and those defined phrases are devoid of meaning \nwithout looking at their definitions in § 675(1) and (5). Because these are defined \nphrases, every time those phrases appear in the statute, their definitions must be \nplugged into their place. See King v. Burwell, 576 U.S. 473, 489 (2015); cf. Tanzin v. \nTanvir, 141 S. Ct. 486, 490 (2020) (noting that a statutory definition controls over the \nplain  meaning  of  a  word).  When  the  child-focused  language  is  imported  into \n§ 671(a)(16), it is plainly structured to benefit the children in foster care. \n  Second, the Defendants insist that § 671(a)(16) has an “aggregate focus.” Defs.’ \nMot. 30–31. This is belied by the requirements that the case plan must be developed \n“for each child” and that the case review system meet the requirements for “each such \nchild.” See Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 171 (“The fact that these provisions are \n‘embedded within the requirements for a state plan’ does not transform them into an \ninstitutional policy.” (quoting Rio Grande, 397 F.3d at 74)). \n  The Defendants cite 31 Foster Children for the proposition that § 671(a)(16) \nhas an aggregate focus. Defs.’ Mot. 31. But 31 Foster Children is of little precedential \nvalue. The plaintiffs in 31 Foster Children brought suit specifically to enforce two \nparticular provisions of § 675(5) (not § 671)—that is, some of the requirements for a \ncase review system. 329 F.3d at 1270. And the Eleventh Circuit found that because \n \nthe case that both the State’s case review system provides adequate protections for foster children and \nthat the AACWA’s requirement for this case review system is not sufficiently focused on benefitting \nindividual foster children. \n50 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 51 of 60    PageID #: 431\nthose aspects of the statute were “definitional in nature, they alone cannot and do not \nsupply a basis for conferring rights enforceable under § 1983.” Id. at 1271. The 31 \nFoster Children court thus looked to § 671(a)(16) because it is the only other part of \nthat portion of the AACWA that uses the term “case review system.” Id. But the court \nfound it significant that § 671(a)(16) did not “explicitly require a plan to meet the \nrequirements” of the particular provisions of § 675(5) that the plaintiffs sought to \nenforce. Id. That is, while § 671(a)(16) required that a case review system meet other \nrequirements specified in the statute, it did not require a case review system to meet \nthe requirements that the plaintiffs sought to enforce. Id. The court thus found it \nsignificant that Congress required compliance with some aspects of the case review \nsystem but not others. Id. at 1272. \n  That statutory mismatch no longer exists because § 671(a)(16) has specifically \nincluded a reference to § 675(5) in its entirety since 2014. See M.B., 2018 WL 327767, \nat *15 n.8. The 31 Foster Children analysis is thus inapt. See Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at \n292 (noting that 31 Foster Children—which was binding precedent—did not control \nbecause it only held that § 675(5)(D) and (E) together with § 671(a)(16) did not alone \ncreate privately enforceable rights). \n  The 31 Foster Children analysis also contravenes the Suter fix. The Eleventh \nCircuit noted the references to individual children and their placements in § 675(5) \nbut reasoned that because these references are only “made in the context of describing \nwhat the procedure is supposed to ensure,” they “cannot make out the requisite \ncongressional intent to confer individual rights enforceable by § 1983.” 31 Foster \n51 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 52 of 60    PageID #: 432\nChildren, 329 F.3d at 1272 (quoting Gonzaga, 536 U.S. at 289). That sounds like a \nconclusion that inclusion of these references as requirements as part of a state plan \nnecessarily means that there is no enforceable private right. But that is exactly the \nreasoning that the Suter fix disavowed. See Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at 168 & n.9. \n  Third, the Defendants argue that the language of § 671(a)(16) “stands in stark \ncontrast” to the language of other statutes that do provide for private causes of action, \nsuch as Title IX. Defs.’ Mot. 31. I am not persuaded that there is a meaningful \ndifference  between  the  “No  person  .  .  .  shall”  language  in  Title  IX26  and  the \nrequirement that a state “shall have a plan approved by the Secretary which . . . \nprovides for the development of a case plan . . . for each child . . . and provides for a \ncase review system . . . with respect to each such child.” In my view, the inclusion of \nthe requirement that the plan be approved by the Secretary does not vitiate the \nstatute’s focus that a case plan and case review system must be established for “each \nchild.” And that “each child” language is just as individualized as the language in \nTitle IX. \n  Fourth, the Defendants point to § 674(d)(3)(A) as evidence that Congress did \nnot intend to establish a private cause of action. Section 674(d)(3)(A) specifically \ncreates a private cause of action by allowing “[a]ny individual who is aggrieved by a \n \n26   Title IX says: “No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education \nprogram or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,” except in certain circumstances. 20 U.S.C. \n§ 1681(a). \n52 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 53 of 60    PageID #: 433\nviolation  of”  §  671(a)(18)  to  sue.  42  U.S.C.  §  674(d)(3)(A).  Section  671(a)(18), \nmeanwhile, requires a state plan to: \nprovide[ ] that neither the State nor any other entity in the State that receives \nfunds from the Federal Government and is involved in adoption or foster care \nplacements may— \n \n(A) deny to any person the opportunity to become an adoptive or a foster \nparent, on the basis of the race, color, or national origin of the person, or \nof the child, involved; or \n \n(B) delay or deny the placement of a child for adoption or into foster care, \non the basis of the race, color, or national origin of the adoptive or foster \nparent, or the child, involved . . . . \n \nId. § 671(a)(18). That § 674(d)(3)(A) creates a private cause of action for a violation of \n§ 671(a)(18) is obvious. And some courts have concluded that Congress’s decision to \nadd this provision explicitly allowing a lawsuit for a violation of § 671(a)(18) but not \nfor any other parts of § 671 “is strong evidence that Congress did not intend” the other \nparts of § 671(a) to allow for a private cause of action. See, e.g., Charlie H., 83 F. Supp. \n2d at 489; Ashley W. ex rel. Durnell v. Holcomb, 467 F. Supp. 3d 644, 659 (S.D. Ind. \n2020) (citing Charlie H.). \n  I am not as persuaded. To begin with, it is difficult to read too much into \nCongress’s failure to do something, especially when there is no authoritative evidence \nexplaining such a failure to act. For example, it may be the case that some legislators \nthought it unnecessary to spell out that a private cause of action existed for other \naspects of § 671 because they already interpreted the statute to allow it. See Bostock \nv. Clayton Cnty., 140 S. Ct. 1731, 1747 (2020) (“Maybe some in the later legislatures \nunderstood the impact [the statute’s] broad language already promised for cases like \n53 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 54 of 60    PageID #: 434\nours and didn’t think a revision needed.”). In short, “speculation about why a later \nCongress” failed to legislate in a particular manner “offers a particularly dangerous \nbasis on which to rest an interpretation of an existing law a different and earlier \nCongress did adopt.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n  The argument that § 674(d)(3)(A) is the only permissible private cause of action \nunder the AACWA also proves too much. Congress made clear in enacting the Suter \nfix that, outside of § 671(a)(15), it expected that some parts of the AACWA allowed for \nprivate rights of action. To say that they do not contravenes Congress’s clear intent \nin enacting the Suter fix. \n  There is also a logical explanation for why § 674(d)(3)(A) is different from the \nrest  of  the  AACWA.  Section  671(a)(18)  is  uniquely  situated  among  the  other \nprovisions  of  §  671(a)  in  that  it  embodies  an  antidiscrimination  value  that  is \nomnipresent in the United States Code. It transcends the foster care system. The \nother aspects of § 671(a), on the other hand, are particular to the foster care context. \nIt thus makes sense that Congress would want to provide an explicit private cause of \naction for victims of discrimination as it does in other statutes (like in Title IX). Given \nhow distinct § 671(a)(18) is from the rest of the statute, the inclusion of § 674(d)(3)(A) \nis not significant evidence of a congressional intent on the broader issue of whether \n§ 671(a)(16) allows for a private cause of action.   \nii.  Judicially discernible language \n  The case plan and case review system requirements are not so vague and \namorphous as to strain judicial competence. Elisa W., 2016 WL 4750178, at *5; Sam \n54 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 55 of 60    PageID #: 435\nM., 800 F. Supp. 2d at 388; Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 292; Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at \n947. Each has multiple, highly specific components that are easy enough for a court \nto assess. Sam M., 800 F. Supp. 2d at 388; see Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at 947 (“These \nprovisions [of the AACWA] are extraordinarily specific, spelling out exactly what a \nstate must do for children in its care in order to receive funding under the Act.”). For \nexample, it is no particular challenge for a court to review a case plan to determine \nwhether it contains a description of the child’s placement, a plan for the child’s safe \nand proper care, the child’s health and education records, or a plan for ensuring the \neducational  stability  of  the  child.  42  U.S.C.  §  675(1)(A),  (B),  (C),  (G).  Nor  is  it \nunusually difficult for a court to assess a case review system to determine whether it \nhas a plan designed to achieve a placement that is in the best interests of the child, a \nprocedure to evaluate the child’s status every six months (including assessing specific \naspects of the child’s placement), or whether the child’s health and education record \nis reviewed and updated. See id. § 675(5)(A), (B), (D). \n  Some of these provisions are nonspecific, to be sure, and there is a lot of room \nfor states to have flexibility in crafting case plans and case review systems. But the \ndifficulty comes on the front end—in terms of a state crafting such a plan and \nsystem—not on the back end, in terms of evaluating what the state has developed. \nFor example, it may be difficult for a state to figure out how to develop a procedure \nfor assuring that “each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in a \nsetting . . . consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child.” See id. \n§ 675(5)(A). But this “best interests of the child” benchmark is a familiar judicial \n55 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 56 of 60    PageID #: 436\nstandard that the Maine state courts are often called on to apply in family court \nproceedings.  See  Costigan  v.  Costigan,  418  A.2d  1144,  1146  (Me.  1980)  (“The \nparamount concern of the court in any proceeding concerning child custody is to act \nin the best interest of the child.”). It may not be an easy standard, but it is a judicially \nadministrable one. See id. (“In determining [who] will provide for a child’s best \ninterests, the court should consider all factors having reasonable bearing on the \nphysical and psychological well-being of the child.”). \niii.

Supp. 2d at 171; Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at 947. The statute clearly \nimposes  a  binding  obligation  on  the  states.  Kenny  A.,  218  F.R.D.  at  292.  The \nDefendants do not dispute this. \niv.  Whether  Congress  shut  the  door  to  private \nenforcement \n  The Defendants have not argued here that Congress has expressly or impliedly \nattempted to overcome any presumption of enforceability, and there is no indication \nthat it has. For example, AACWA has no private enforcement mechanism. Sam M., \n800 F. Supp. 2d at 388; Kenny A., 218 F.R.D. at 292; Connor B., 771 F. Supp. 2d at \n171–72. And the Suter fix plainly left the door to private enforcement open. \n56 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 57 of 60    PageID #: 437\nb.  Section 622(b)(8)(A)(ii) \n  Unlike with § 671, the language of § 622 is not focused on the intended \nbeneficiary (the foster children) but rather is focused on the Secretary. The only \nreference to the Secretary in § 671 is requiring that the plan be approved by the \nSecretary, but otherwise, § 671 requires a case plan and case review system meeting \nthe specified requirements, most of which are directly intended to benefit foster \nchildren. The role of the Secretary in § 671 appears purely ministerial. That is, while \n§ 671 notes that a state’s case plan and case review system must be approved by the \nSecretary, the focus of § 671 is on ensuring that the case plan and case review system \nare comprised of the individual components designed to benefit foster children.27 \n  Section 622, on the other hand, is focused on ensuring that the case review \nsystem is being implemented in a manner that is “to the satisfaction of the Secretary.” \nSo, while § 671 is focused on ensuring that the case review system contains the \nparticular  components  intended  to  benefit  foster  children,  §  622  is  focused  on \nensuring that the case review system is operating to the satisfaction of the Secretary.  \nThis belt and suspenders approach exists presumably to ensure that a state’s case \nreview system is operating in the way Congress intended, both to ensure foster \nchildren are being helped (§ 671) and to ensure that the Secretary is satisfied of the \n \n27   The grammar of § 671(a) supports this reading as well. The statute says that states “shall have \na plan approved by the Secretary which” provides for various requirements. That is, § 671(a) does not \nrequire that the Secretary approve a plan, but rather it requires that a plan has been approved by the \nSecretary. If there were a comma after “Secretary,” it would support the reading that the “shall” \nmandates the plan approval. Because of the lack of a comma, the sentence implies that the plan must \nhave been approved by the Secretary at some point but that the “shall” is directed at mandating the \nlisted requirements, rather than the plan approval. \n57 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 58 of 60    PageID #: 438\nsame (§ 622). But only § 671 is focused directly on the benefit to foster children, and \nonly § 671 can support a private cause of action. The Defendants’ motion is thus \nGRANTED with respect to the Plaintiffs’ AACWA claim premised on a violation of \n§ 622. \n2.  Merits of the Claim \n  The Defendants contend that even if a private cause of action can be brought \npursuant to the AACWA, “DHHS policy plainly meets the dictates of the AACWA.” \nDefs.’ Mot. 32. OCFS has a policy governing the management of health records for \nyouth in foster care. OCFS Policy V.I-2. An OCFS caseworker “is responsible for \ngathering [a youth’s] health and health care information and providing it directly to \nthe foster parent or other child care provider at the time of the child’s placement.” Id. \nat 1. The child’s caseworker is then responsible for updating this health record. Id. \nSimilarly, the child’s caseworker is responsible for updating the child’s portable \nhealth record, either by providing an updated “sheet” to the caretaker or by asking \nthe foster parent or caretaker to make the necessary changes on the existing sheet. \nId. at 4. Whenever a child’s placement changes, the portable health record is returned \nto an OCFS caseworker, who reviews the record and adds any information not already \nrecorded in it. Id. at 6. “While the child is in [OCFS] care or custody, the child’s \ncaseworker is responsible for adding medical information to the child’s case record in \norder that the case record contain that included in the portable health record.” Id. \nThese updates must occur at the time of each child’s placement, or at least every six \nmonths. Id. \n58 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 59 of 60    PageID #: 439\n  While this policy does exist, the Defendants ignore the Plaintiffs’ allegations \nthat the Defendants have violated their own policies.28 The Defendants also nitpick \nthe Plaintiffs’ allegations regarding their medical records and portray them as failing \nto allege any violation of federal law. Defs.’ Mot. 33–34. That is not so. Every plaintiff \nexcept Trent W. has alleged that the Defendants have not maintained updated \nmedical  records  or  provided  those  updated  medical  records  to  the  Plaintiffs’ \ncaregivers, in violation of the AACWA. FAC ¶¶ 23, 30–34 (Bryan), 53 (Henry), 98–99 \n(Grayson), 124 (Kendall), 148–49 (Neville). To the extent that the Defendants allege \nthat these allegations are unclear or conclusory, I disagree. They meet the low bar to \nsurvive a motion to dismiss. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, the Court DENIES the Defendants’ motion to \ndismiss, except the Court GRANTS the Defendants’ motion to dismiss the aspect of \nthe Plaintiffs’ AACWA claim relying on 42 U.S.C. § 622(b)(8)(A)(ii). Although Trent \nW.’s allegations are currently insufficient to support his claims, the Court sua sponte \n \n28   The Defendants do not specifically argue that to the extent that the AACWA allows for a \nprivate cause of action, it only allows a plaintiff to require that a case plan be developed, not that a \ncase plan be implemented. Courts have reached differing conclusions on whether the AACWA private \ncause of action extends to the implementation of the plan. Compare Brian A., 149 F. Supp. 2d at 947 \n(“[T]he enforceable rights in question are not merely procedural rights that the state's plan make the \nrelevant provisions. Rather, the rights that are enforceable include the substantive right that the state \nactually act in accordance with its plan; it must implement that which it assures.” (quoting Wood v. \nTompkins, 33 F.3d 600, 608 n.16 (6th Cir. 1994)), with Elisa W. ex rel. Barricelli v. City of New York, \nNo. 15 CV 5273-LTS-HBP, 2016 WL 4750178, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 12, 2016) (“While it is of course to \nbe expected that a plan will be implemented, nothing in the statutory language specifically requires \nimplementation or achievement of all of the particulars of the plan, much less successful achievement \nof outcomes. Rather, the plan principally serves notice and accountability functions in aid of reviews \nof goals, services and outcomes.”). However, it is a more faithful application of the law, particularly in \nlight of the Suter fix, to say that the cause of action also extends to the implementation of the plan. \nSee Wilder, 496 U.S. at 513–14. \n59 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 43   Filed 10/04/21   Page 60 of 60    PageID #: 440\nGRANTS Trent W. leave to amend his claims.

Second Am. Compl. for Injunctive \n \n1   Pursuant to Rule 25(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Sara Gagné-Holmes is \nsubstituted for Jeanne M.

Compl.”) ¶ 1 (ECF \nNo. 45). In March of 2019, attorneys with Children’s Rights, a national non-profit \norganization advocating for children in state systems, began an investigation of \nMaine’s  practices  in  this  area.  Joint  Mot.  for  Prelim.  Approval  of  Class  Action \nSettlement, Certification of Settlement Class, and Approval of Form and Manner of \nClass Notice (“Joint Mot.”) 1 & n.1 (ECF No. 118); Joint Mot. Ex. 3 (“Nardi Decl.”) \n¶¶ 1, 4 (ECF No. 118-3). Among other things, the investigation included conducting \nextensive factual research on Maine’s child welfare and mental health agencies and \nsystems; identifying, investigating, and pursuing potential legal claims; researching \nrelevant  First  Circuit  law;  and  speaking  with  dozens  of  knowledgeable  people \nthroughout Maine, such as current and former youth in foster care. Nardi Decl. ¶ 4. \n  On January 6, 2021, Bryan C., Henry B., Trent W., Grayson M., Kendall P., \nand Neville H. (together, the “Named Plaintiffs”), through their adult Next Friends, \nfiled a class action lawsuit against Jeanne M. Lambrew in her official capacity as \nCommissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) \nand Todd A. Landry in his official capacity as Director of the Maine Office of Child \nand Family Services (“OCFS”). Compl. for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief and Req. \nfor Class Action (ECF No. 1). The Named Plaintiffs brought the complaint on behalf \nof a putative class of “all children who are or will be in DHHS foster care custody and \nwho are or will be prescribed or administered one or more psychotropic medication[s] \nwhile in state care” (the “Class”). Second Am. Compl. ¶ 160. The Named Plaintiffs \nallege that three of the State’s most pronounced and harmful oversight failures are: \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 3 of 18    PageID #: 1056\n(1)  inadequate  maintenance  and  timely  dissemination  of  medical  records;  (2) \ninadequate informed consent procedures; and (3) an inadequate system to ensure that \noutlier prescriptions of psychotropic drugs to foster care children are flagged for \nsecondary review. Second Am. Compl. ¶ 5. To address these failures, the Named \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for violations of the Class members’ \nsubstantive and procedural due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, as \nwell as violations of the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 621 \net seq., 670 et seq.; Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 280–98. \n  After I denied the Defendants’ motion to dismiss on October 4, 2021, Order on \nDefs.’ Mot. to Dismiss (ECF No. 43), the parties proceeded to discovery, Joint Mot. 2. \nThe discovery process included taking depositions, gathering facts, working with \nexperts,  exchanging  dozens  of  requests  for  production  and  interrogatories,  and \npreparing, reviewing, and exchanging 37,000 pages of discovery material, including \nthe Named Plaintiffs’ case files. Nardi Decl. ¶ 6; Joint Mot. 2. \n  During the discovery process in early 2022, the parties started discussing \nsettlement,  and  Magistrate  Judge  Nivison  agreed  to  assist  them  in  settlement \ndiscussions. Nardi Decl. ¶ 7; see Order Setting Settlement Conference (ECF No. 67).2 \nIn preparation for the first settlement conference, the parties exchanged terms sheets \nand prepared detailed statements for Judge Nivison. Nardi Decl. ¶ 7. The parties \n \n2   The parties assert that they “jointly selected the Honorable Judge John C. Nivison as the \nmediator in February of 2022.” Second Am. Compl. Ex. 1 (“Agreement”) 3 (ECF No. 118-1). That \nstatement is misleading. A number of judicial officers in the District of Maine volunteer to assist \nparties in resolving cases by holding judicial settlement conferences. See Local Rule 83.11(c). Parties \ndo not have the right to “select” a specific judge.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 4 of 18    PageID #: 1057\nengaged in negotiations through Judge Nivison on April 11, 2022, June 1, 2022, and \nJuly 7, 2022 (ECF Nos. 72, 80, 87). On July 13, 2022, the parties entered into a stay \nof discovery (ECF No. 88). The parties met for settlement discussions with Judge \nNivison seven more times over the next year (ECF Nos. 94, 99, 103, 106, 108, 112, \n114). In between meetings, the parties had many direct discussions and utilized \nsubject-matter consultants with knowledge of psychotropic medication oversight and \nsecondary  review.  Nardi  Decl.  ¶ 8.  The  Next  Friends  participated  in  sessions, \nreviewed drafts, and provided feedback. Nardi Decl. ¶ 8.   \n  On  March  1,  2024,  the  parties  executed  a  settlement  agreement  that \ncontemplates resolving the pending claims, with the Court retaining jurisdiction to \nenforce  the  terms  of  the  agreement.  Second  Am.  Compl.  Ex.  1  (“Agreement”) \n§§ IV.1.B, 4.B (ECF No. 118-1). Although both parties believe they could win the case, \nboth sides recognize the risks, burdens, and uncertainties of litigation. Joint Mot. 4.  \n  The Agreement purports to tackle the three main issues with the State’s \nprescribing of psychotropic medication to children in foster care by:  \n1.  Establishing procedures for the timely preparation and dissemination of a \nPortable Health Record for each child in DHHS custody. The Portable Health \nRecord will move with the child from placement to placement and will be \nroutinely updated with medical, mental, and behavioral health information. \nThis  information  will  be  gathered  through  improved  collection  and \nappointment procedures and will be incorporated into the child’s case plan. \nAgreement III.1.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 5 of 18    PageID #: 1058\n2.  Creating a process for informed consent by designated adults and children ages \nfourteen  or  older  that  covers  all  classes  of  psychotropic  medication.  This \nincludes a grievance mechanism; education and training for staff and Resource \nParents3; procedures for emergencies; and a detailed informed consent form. \nAgreement III.2. \n3.  Creating  a  psychiatric  Clinical  Review  Team  to  perform  both  prospective \nreviews of certain recommendations for psychotropic medications for youth in \nfoster  care  and  retrospective  reviews  of  files  for  children  prescribed \npsychotropic medications that meet certain triggers. Agreement III.3. \nTo ensure that these changes are implemented, the Agreement sets Performance \nCriteria, establishes a timeline for implementation and enforcement, and provides \nfor a third-party Implementation Reviewer to monitor the Defendants’ progress. \nAgreement IV.2–3.  \n  The parties also agreed to a communication to all class members about the \nproposed settlement. Joint Suppl. Br. to Joint Mot. Ex. 2 (“Notice”) (ECF No. 119-2).  \nThis four-page Notice explains who it is addressed to, why it is important, what the \nclass action is about, and the terms of the Agreement. Notice 2–3. In addition to \nproviding the time and place of the fairness hearing, the Notice explains what will \nhappen at that hearing, including that I will hear evidence and argument to decide if \nthe settlement should be finally approved. Notice 2, 4. The Notice also explains to \n \n3   A “Resource Parent” is someone providing foster care to children in the State’s custody. \nAgreement § I.14. \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 6 of 18    PageID #: 1059\nClass members how to submit comments or objections to the Agreement and how to \nrequest to speak at the fairness hearing. Notice 4. The Notice further provides a link \nto the Agreement, a number to call for a copy of the Agreement, and the email and \nmailing addresses for class counsel, who will be available to answer questions. Notice \n4–5. \n  The Notice comes with an addendum setting out the plan for sending it to the \nClass. The Defendants will post a copy of the Notice on their websites and will \ntransmit a copy to placement providers, parents, Guardians ad Litem for Class \nmembers,  and  Class  members  in independent  or  transitional  living  placements. \nNotice 7. The Defendants also will send copies to locations that Class members and \ntheir legal representatives would be likely to see them, such as congregate care \nplacements,  group  homes,  residential  counseling  centers,  residential  treatment \ncenters, and child-placing agencies that the Defendants use. Notice 7. \n  The Named Plaintiffs are represented by Children’s Rights and Bernstein, \nShur, Sawyer & Nelson, P.A. (“Bernstein Shur”), a private law firm. Joint Mot. 16. \nAfter additional settlement discussions with Judge Nivison, the parties agreed on \nMarch 22, 2024 that the Defendants would reimburse Plaintiffs’ Counsel $675,000 \nfor their attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses in this matter. Joint Suppl. Br. to Joint \nMot. (“Joint Suppl. Br.”) 1–2 (ECF No. 119); Joint Suppl. Br. Ex. 3 (“Suppl. Nardi \nDecl.”) (ECF No. 119-3). The Notice explains this sum to the prospective Class.

See Joint Mot. On April 4, 2024, \nthe parties filed a joint brief regarding their attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses. See \nJoint Suppl. Br.  \nDISCUSSION \n  I deal first with the parties’ request for preliminary approval of their proposed \nsettlement, then proceed to class certification and appointment of class counsel, and \nfinally address the issue of notice. \nI.  The Settlement Agreement \nA.  Legal Standard \n  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e) provides the procedural framework when \nthe parties to a putative class action have reached a proposed settlement. Anderson \nv. Team Prior, Inc., 2:19-cv-00452-NT, 2021 WL 3852720, at *4 (D. Me. Aug. 27, 2021); \nMichaud v. Monroe Muffler Brake, Inc., No. 2:12-cv-00353-NT, 2015 WL 1206490, at \n*8 (D. Me. Mar. 17, 2015). Before notice can be sent to the putative class, the parties \nmust demonstrate that the court “will likely be able to . . . approve the proposal under \nRule 23(e)(2).” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(1)(B)(i). Rule 23(e)(2), which governs whether a \nsettlement is finally approvable, requires a finding, after hearing, that the proposal \nis:   \nfair, reasonable, and adequate, after considering whether:  \n(A)  the  class  representatives  and  class  counsel  have  adequately \nrepresented the class; \n(B) the proposal was negotiated at arm’s length; \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 8 of 18    PageID #: 1061\n(C) the relief provided for the class is adequate, taking into account: \n(i) the costs, risks, and delay of trial and appeal; \n(ii) the effectiveness of any proposed method of distributing relief \nto the class, including the method of processing class-member \nclaims; \n(iii) the terms of any proposed award of attorney’s fees, including \ntiming of payment; and \n(iv) any agreement required to be identified under Rule 23(e)(3); \nand \n(D) the proposal treats class members equitably relative to each other. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2).  \n  The preliminary approval contemplated by Rule 23(e)(1)(B)(i) may be given \nwhere it results from the parties’ “serious, informed, and non-collusive negotiations”; \n“there are no grounds to doubt its fairness and no other obvious deficiencies” such as \nunduly preferential treatment of certain class members or excessive compensation \nfor  attorneys;  and  “the  settlement  appears  to  fall  within  the  range  of  possible \napproval.” Anderson, 2021 WL 3852720, at *5 (internal citations and quotation marks \nomitted). If the parties negotiated at arm’s length and conducted sufficient discovery, \nthe  Court  presumes  the  settlement  is  reasonable.  In  re  Pharm.  Indus.  Average \nWholesale  Price  Litig.,  588  F.3d  24,  32–33  (1st  Cir.  2009);  Anderson,  2021  WL \n3852720, at *7. \nB.  Application \n  At this preliminary, pre-fairness hearing stage, I find that the parties have \ndemonstrated that the Agreement likely “fall[s] within the range of possible final \napproval.” Michaud, 2015 WL 1206490, at *9 (quoting Trombley v. Bank of Am. Corp., \nNo. 08–cv–456–JD, 2011 WL 3740488, at *4 (D.R.I. Aug. 24, 2011)). \n8 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 9 of 18    PageID #: 1062\n  First,  as  addressed  more  fully  below,  the  class  representatives  and  class \ncounsel have adequately represented the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(A). \n  Second, over the course of sixteen months, the parties engaged in ten judicial \nsettlement  conferences  with  Judge  Nivison  while  simultaneously  engaging  in \ndiscovery and seeking the input of outside experts and consultants. The Agreement \nis a product of these extensive arm’s-length negotiations. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(B). \n  Third, the relief provided for the class is likely adequate. Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(e)(2)(C).  The  Agreement  addresses  the  three  main  problems  alleged  in  the \nComplaint: inadequate maintenance and timely dissemination of medical records; the \nlack of a meaningful informed consent process; and the need for a secondary review \nsystem to screen outlier and high-risk prescriptions. The Agreement does so by \ncreating  new  practices  for  collecting  and  disseminating  medical  information, \nobtaining informed consent from caretakers and older youth, and prospectively and \nretrospectively reviewing outlier prescriptions.  \n  The parties acknowledge that there would be notable risks, costs, and delays \nfor both sides if this case were to go to trial. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C)(i). As I noted \nin my Order on the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, the standard for substantive due \nprocess claims in the foster care context is unsettled. See Order on Defs.’ Mot. to \nDismiss  26–27.  If  the  parties  were  to  forgo  settlement,  there  would  likely  be \nadditional  delays  and  costs  related  to  completing  discovery,  class  certification, \nsummary judgment, expert challenges, and, ultimately, trial. See Joint Mot. 8. The \n9 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 10 of 18    PageID #: 1063\nAgreement avoids these risks by offering systemic reforms that will provide relief for \nall Class members within the timeframe in the Agreement.  \n  The  proposed  method  of  providing  relief  seems  effective.  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(ii). The Agreement requires systemic changes, meaning all children in \nfoster care who are prescribed psychotropic drugs will benefit from the new practices \nand policies. The Agreement thus appears to effectively provide relief while treating \nclass members equitably relative to each other. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C)(ii), (e)(2)(D). \n  Finally, the proposed award of $675,000 in attorney’s fees, also negotiated at \narm’s  length,  appears  reasonable  at  this  preliminary  stage.4  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P. \n23(e)(2)(C)(iii). Counsel for the Named Plaintiffs investigated this matter for over a \nyear before they even filed suit. Over the past two years, they were required to litigate \nthe Defendants’ motion to dismiss, engaged in extensive discovery, and participated \nin extended settlement talks. Joint Mot. 8. Further, the attorney’s fees award appears \nreasonable in comparison to similar cases. See M.B. v. Tidball, No. 2:17-cv-4102-NKL, \n2020  WL  1666159,  at  *2,  20  (W.D.  Mo.  Apr.  3,  2020),  aff’d  sub  nom.  M.B.  by \nEggemeyer v. Tidball, 18 F.4th 565 (8th Cir. 2021) (awarding $3,253,651.25 in fees \nand $132,907.56 in expenses where case settled two years after complaint was filed \n \n4   One method for awarding fees in class actions is the “lodestar” method, under which class \ncounsel’s fee is calculated based on the time spent on the matter, the attorneys’ hourly rates, and any \nmultipliers or discounts for special circumstances. Michaud v. Monroe Muffler Brake, Inc., No. 2:12-\ncv-00353-NT, 2015 WL 1206490, at *8 (D. Me. Mar. 17, 2015). The parties represent that the \nnegotiated amount is a significant reduction of the over $1 million class counsel could have sought \nunder the lodestar analysis. Joint Suppl. Br. to Joint Mot. 5 (ECF No. 119); Joint Suppl. Br. to Joint \nMot. Ex. 3, at 2 (ECF No. 119-3). Class counsel should be prepared to discuss the lodestar analysis \nwith appropriate accompanying documentation prior to the final fairness hearing or the filing of any \nmotion for attorney’s fees.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 11 of 18    PageID #: 1064\nin a similar class action involving the use of psychotropics in foster care); M.B. v. \nHoward, 555 F. Supp. 3d 1047, 1092 (D. Kan. 2021) (awarding $2,225,306.64 in fees \nand $72,305.15 in expenses where case settled 18 months after the complaint was \nfiled in a foster care reform class action concerning mental health oversight). \n  The parties have met their burden of demonstrating that I will likely be able \nto approve the Agreement under the Rule 23(e)(2) factors.5  \nII.  Class Certification  \nNext, the parties seek provisional certification of the class. Joint Mot. 9. \nA.  Legal Standard  \n  Pursuant to Rule 23 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, parties requesting \nclass certification must demonstrate that: \n(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; \n(2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; \n(3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the \nclaims or defenses of the class; and \n(4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the \ninterests of the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). “If the conditions are satisfied, a court may certify a class action \nif the action is of a type identified in section (b) of the Rule.” Miller v. Carrington \nMortg. Servs., LLC, No. 2:19-cv-00016-JDL, 2020 WL 2898837, at *1 (D. Me. June 3, \n2020). One of those types of actions is where “the party opposing the class has acted \nor refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \n \n5   One concern that I have with the Agreement is that it requires the Court to retain jurisdiction \nfor as long as the Agreement is in effect. See Agreement IV.1.B.a (anticipating a five-year term subject \nto extension). The parties should be prepared at the hearing on final approval to address my concern \nwith this Court retaining jurisdiction for an unlimited amount of time. \n11 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 12 of 18    PageID #: 1065\nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). \nB.  Application \n1.  Numerosity \n  The class must be “so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.” \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). “ ‘Impracticability’ does not mean ‘impossibility,’ but only the \ndifficulty or inconvenience of joining all members of the class.” Michaud, 2015 WL \n1206490, at *2 (quoting Advert. Specialty Nat’l Ass’n v. Fed. Trade Comm’n, 238 F.2d \n108, 119 (1st Cir. 1956)). “[C]ourts in this circuit have generally found that a class of \n40 or more individuals satisfies numerosity.” Venegas v. Global Aircraft Servs., 159 \nF. Supp. 3d 93, 98 (D. Me. 2016). \n  Here, as of December of 2023, DHHS had legal custody of approximately 2,500 \nchildren,  about  500  of  whom  had  been  prescribed  one  or  more  psychotropic \nmedication.  When  future  foster  children  are  factored  in,  the  number  of  Class \nmembers is even higher. Joint Mot. 12. The numerosity requirement has been met.  \n2.  Commonality \n  Rule 23(a)(2) requires that “there are questions of law or fact common to the \nclass.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(a)(2).  Class  members’  claims  must  be  capable  of \n“generat[ing] common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.” Wal-Mart \nStores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, 350 (2011) (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted). “Those common answers typically come in the form of ‘a particular and \nsufficiently well-defined set of allegedly illegal policies or practices’ that work similar \nharm on the class plaintiffs.” Parent/Pro. Advoc. League v. City of Springfield, 934 \n12 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 13 of 18    PageID #: 1066\nF.3d 13, 28 (1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Parsons v. Ryan, 754 F.3d 657, 679 (9th Cir. \n2014)). \n  In this case, the Named Plaintiffs challenged the Defendants’ system-wide \npolicies and practices concerning the monitoring and oversight of the administration \nof psychotropic medications to Class members. Considering that each member of the \nClass is, has been, or will be in foster care in Maine, they are equally subject to the \npolicies applicable to the foster care system. Joint Mot. 12. The Class members also \nshare the legal questions of whether DHHS’s policies and practices violate their \nconstitutional and statutory rights, which can be answered on a class-wide basis. See \nM.B. v. Corsi, 327 F.R.D. 271, 278–80 (W.D. Mo. 2018) (certifying class in a similar \ncase about reforming the use of psychotropics in Missouri’s foster care system). The \ncommonality requirement has been met. \n3.  Typicality \n  Rule 23(a)(3) requires that “the claims or defenses of the representative parties \n[must be] typical of the claims or defenses of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(3). \n“Typicality is satisfied when the named plaintiff[s’] ‘injuries arise from the same \nevents or course of conduct as do the injuries of the class and when the plaintiff[s’] \nclaims and those of the class are based on the same legal theory.” Anderson v. Team \nPrior, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-00452-NT, 2022 WL 1156056, at *3 (D. Me. Apr. 19, 2022) \n(quoting Glynn v. Me. Oxy-Acetylene Supply Co., No. 2:19-cv-00176-NT, 2020 WL \n6528072, at *2 (D. Me. Nov. 5, 2020)). \n  Here, like the rest of the Class, the Named Plaintiffs are youth in Maine’s \nfoster care system prescribed psychotropic medications. Second Am. Compl. ¶¶ 11–\n13 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 14 of 18    PageID #: 1067\n151, 160. The Named Plaintiffs’ injuries arise from the Defendants’ policies and \nprocedures regarding the administration of psychotropics to youth in foster care, so \nthe Named Plaintiffs’ and the wider Class’s claims are based on the same legal \ntheories, and the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the Class.  \n4.  Adequacy \n  The fourth requirement is that “the representative parties will fairly and \nadequately protect the interests of the class.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). The Supreme \nCourt has explained that this requirement “serves to uncover conflicts of interest \nbetween  named  parties  and  the  class  they  seek  to  represent,”  and  “factors  in \ncompetency and conflicts of class counsel.” Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. \n591, 625, 626 n.20 (1997). “Only conflicts that are fundamental to the suit and that \ngo to the heart of the litigation prevent a plaintiff from meeting the Rule 23(a)(4) \nadequacy requirement.” Matamoros v. Starbucks Corp., 699 F.3d 129, 138 (1st Cir. \n2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \n  The Named Plaintiffs’ interest in addressing current deficiencies in Maine’s \npsychotropic medication program for foster care youth aligns neatly with the interest \nof the Class at large. There is also no evidence of class counsel’s lack of competency \nor conflicts of interest, “such as differences in the type of relief sought, a theory of law \nor fact that benefits some class members, but harms others, or a scenario where some \nclass members benefit from the defendant’s conduct.” Michaud, 2015 WL 1206490, at \n*4; see also M.B. v. Corsi, 327 F.R.D. at 282. The adequacy requirement has been \nsatisfied. \n14 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 15 of 18    PageID #: 1068\n5.  Rule 23(b) Requirement \n  As discussed above, a class must also satisfy one of the requirements of Rule \n23(b). The parties represent that the Class here satisfies Rule 23(b)(2). The subsection \nprovides that certification is appropriate if “the party opposing the class has acted or \nrefused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a \nwhole.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Classes certified under Rule 23(b)(2) are often “the \nvehicle for civil rights actions and other institutional reform cases,” such as cases \nalleging deficiencies in government-administered programs. Hawkins ex rel. Hawkins \nv. Comm’r of N.H. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. Civ. 99-143-JD, 2004 WL \n166722, at *4 (D.N.H. Jan. 23, 2004) (internal quotations and citation omitted); see \nM.B. v. Corsi, 327 F.R.D. at 282. \n  The Named Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants acted or refused to act on \ngrounds that apply to the Class generally by implementing policies and practices \nregarding the prescribing of psychotropic medications to Class members. The Named \nPlaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief rather than monetary damages, as \ncontemplated by Rule 23(b)(2). Rule 23(b)(2) is satisfied. See M.B. v. Corsi, 327 F.R.D. \nat 282; Hawkins, 2004 WL 166722, at *4 (granting the parties’ joint motion and \ncertifying  Rule  23(b)(2)  class  consisting  of  children  who  alleged  that  the  New \nHampshire Department of Health and Human Services failed to provide dental \nservices). \n15 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 16 of 18    PageID #: 1069\nIII.  Class Counsel \nA.  Legal Standard  \n  “Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(g), the Court must appoint \ncounsel who will ‘fairly and adequately represent the interest of the class.’ ” Conant \nv. FMC Corp., 2:19-cv-00296-JDL, 2020 WL 1482634, at *3 (D. Me. Mar. 27, 2020) \n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(4)), R. & R. adopted 2020 WL 2145318. The Rule \nrequires me to consider:  \n(i) the work counsel has done in identifying or investigating potential \nclaims in the action; \n(ii)  counsel’s  experience  in  handling  class  actions,  other  complex \nlitigation, and the types of claims asserted in the action; \n(iii) counsel’s knowledge of the applicable law; and \n(iv) the resources that counsel will commit to representing the class. \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(g)(1)(A).  \nB.  Application  \n  As this case’s history and the declarations of Attorneys Nardi and Woodcock \nshow, proposed counsel meet Rule 23(g)’s standards. Proposed counsel investigated \nand researched this case for over a year prior to filing the initial complaint. Nardi \nDecl.  ¶ 4.  They  have  extensive  class  action  experience  both  in  this  Court  and \nnationally, and they have represented youth in the child welfare system in similar \ncases. Nardi Decl. ¶¶ 2–3, 5, 11–12; Woodcock Decl. ¶¶ 2, 7. Proposed counsel have \nalso  demonstrated  knowledge  of  the  applicable  law  during  the  litigation  of  the \nDefendants’  motion  to  dismiss.  Finally,  Children’s  Rights  and  Bernstein  Shur \nrepresent  that  they  have  dedicated  considerable  resources  to  the  case  and  will \ncontinue to do so. In addition, in this and other cases, counsel have consistently \n16 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT   Document 120   Filed 07/03/24   Page 17 of 18    PageID #: 1070\ndemonstrated that they are highly skilled and knowledgeable practitioners. Nardi \nDecl. ¶ 10; Woodcock Decl. ¶¶ 6–7. Because the record reflects that counsel have and \nwill continue to fairly and adequately represent the class, I find it appropriate to \nappoint Children’s Rights and Bernstein Shur as class counsel in this case.  \nIV.  Notice \n  For a class certified under Rule 23(b)(2), I may “direct appropriate notice to the \nclass” “in a reasonable manner.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(c)(2)(a), (e)(1)(B). I must find that \nthe notice “is reasonably calculated to reach the class members and inform them of \nthe existence of and the opportunity to object to the settlement.” Nilsen v. York Cnty., \n382 F. Supp. 2d 206, 210 (D. Me. 2005).  \n  I have reviewed the Notice and find that it is clear, concise, and states in plain \nlanguage the certified class definition, what the class action is about, what the \nAgreement does, and how to be heard on the matter and contact class counsel. The \nparties plan to disseminate the Notice online, send copies directly to Class members \nand their guardians, and post copies in locations that Class members and their legal \nrepresentatives would be likely to see them. The Notice also explains the agreed-upon \nattorney’s fees. Other courts have approved similar notice plans in foster care class \nactions. See M.B. v. Tidball, No. 2:17-cv-04102, ECF Nos. 280, 282, at 4–6 (W.D. Mo. \nJuly 15, 2019); M.B. v. Howard, No. 2:18-cv-02617, ECF No. 140, at 5–8 (D. Kan. \nSept.  9,  2020).  Accordingly,  the  Notice  satisfies  Rule  23  and  due  process \nrequirements. See id.; Michaud, 2015 WL 1206490, at *10; In re New Motor Vehicles \nCanadian Export Antitrust Litig., 270 F.R.D. 30, 35–36 (D.

Second  Am.  Compl.  for  Injunctive  and \nDeclaratory Relief and Req. for Class Action ¶¶ 1–8 (ECF No. 45).2 \n  On March 1, 2024, after participating in extensive settlement discussions with \nthe United States Magistrate Judge, the parties moved for preliminary approval of a \nclass action settlement agreement. Joint Mot. for Prelim. Approval of Class Action \nSettlement (ECF No. 118). On April 3, 2024, the parties filed a joint brief regarding \nattorney’s fees and costs. See Joint Suppl. Br. to Joint Mot. for Prelim. Approval (ECF \nNo. 119); Joint Agreement on Mediated Fees (ECF No. 119-1). On July 3, 2024, I granted \npreliminary approval of the proposed settlement. Order on Joint Mot. for Prelim. \nApproval of Class Action Settlement (“Prelim. Approval Order”) (ECF No. 120). \nAmong  other  things,  my  order  preliminarily  approved  the  parties’  proposed \nsettlement agreement, see Joint Settlement Agreement (“Agreement”) (ECF No. \n118-1); provisionally certified the proposed Class; appointed Class counsel; approved \nthe proposed notice plan; and directed Class counsel to issue notices to all Class \nmembers. Prelim. Approval Order 18. In my order, I also asked the parties to prepare \nbriefing or comments on a provision in the Agreement that would maintain this \nCourt’s  jurisdiction  even  after  settlement  approval  and  dismissal  of  the  action. \nPrelim. Approval Order 11 n.5. \n  The parties jointly moved for final approval on September 11, 2024. Joint Mot. \nfor Final Approval of Class Action Settlement (“Mot. for Final Approval”) (ECF No. \n \n2   The original and amended complaints were filed by six named plaintiffs through their adult \nnext friends (ECF Nos. 1, 22, 45). One plaintiff was removed after reaching the age of majority (ECF \nNo. 57). See Joint Settlement Agreement § I.8 (defining “Named Plaintiffs”) (ECF No. 118-1). \n2 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 3 of 8    PageID #:\n1203\n123). As required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e), I held a final fairness \nhearing on November 4, 2024. Order Scheduling Final Fairness Hr’g (ECF No. 122); \nMinute Entry (ECF No. 127). Five individuals spoke at the hearing in favor of the \nAgreement, including three adults serving as next friends in the lawsuit, one young \nwoman who was a named plaintiff until she reached the age of majority, and one \ncommunity member not directly involved in the litigation.3 \nDISCUSSION \n  I now consider whether to certify the Class and finally approve the Agreement, \nincluding Class counsel’s request for attorney’s fees and the Agreement’s provision \non this Court’s continuing jurisdiction. \nI.  Class Certification \n  I begin by determining whether the proposed Class meets the requirements for \ncertification for settlement purposes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23. See \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a).4 The Class consists of “children who are or will be in Defendants’ \nfoster care custody and who are or will be prescribed one or more Psychotropic \nMedication[s] while in state care.” Agreement § I.12; Mot. for Final Approval 5. \n  In my preliminary approval order, I found the Class satisfied Rule 23(a)’s \nrequirements  of  numerosity,  commonality,  typicality,  and  adequacy  of \n \n3   See Pls.’ Summ. of Comments and Requests to Speak at the Fairness Hr’g in Response to the \nNotice of Proposed Class Action Settlement (“Pls.’ Summ. of Comments”) (ECF No. 124). \n4   See also Anderson v. Team Prior, Inc., No. 2:19-cv-00452-NT, 2022 WL 16531690, at *3 (D. Me. \nOct. 28, 2022) (“A class proposed to be certified for settlement purposes must meet the class action \nrequirements prescribed in Rule 23(a) and (b).”) (citing Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.S. 591, \n620–22 (1997)). \n3 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 4 of 8    PageID #:\n1204\nrepresentation. Prelim. Approval Order 11–14. I also found the Class satisfied Rule \n23(b)(2) because the Defendants “acted or refused to act on grounds that apply \ngenerally” to all Class members, such that final injunctive or declaratory relief “is \nappropriate respecting the [C]lass as a whole. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).” Prelim. \nApproval  Order  15.  The  parties  assert  that  “[n]othing  has  changed”  since  my \npreliminary approval order “that would alter the propriety of certification of the \nClass.” Mot. for Final Approval 6. Accordingly, further analysis is unnecessary, and \nthe Class is hereby certified for settlement purposes under Rule 23.5 \nII.  Settlement Approval \n  I now turn to the proposed settlement. Under Rule 23(e), to approve a proposed \nsettlement for a Rule 23(b)(2) class, I am required to: (1) ensure that reasonable \nnotice has been given to all class members; (2) determine “after a hearing” that the \nproposed settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate”; (3) require the parties to \nidentify “any agreement made in connection with the proposal”; and (4) provide an \nopportunity for class member objections. Scovil v. FedEx Ground Package Sys., Inc., \nNo. 1:10-cv-515-DBH, 2014 WL 1057079, at *2 (D. Me. Mar. 14, 2014) (quoting Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 23(e)). \n \n5   Other courts have found classes of children in foster care custody to satisfy the requirements \nof Rule 23(b). See, e.g., D.G. v. Devaughn, 594 F.3d 1188, 1192 (10th Cir. 2010) (affirming the \ncertification of a class of foster children in Oklahoma); M.B. v. Corsi, 327 F.R.D. 271, 278–80 (W.D. \nMo. 2018) (certifying a class of foster children challenging Missouri’s use of psychotropic drugs); \nConnor B. ex rel. Vigurs v. Patrick, 272 F.R.D. 288, 292 (D. Mass. 2011) (certifying a class of children \nchallenging various failures by Massachusetts’s foster care system); Hawkins ex rel. Hawkins v. \nComm’r of N.H. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. Civ. 99-143-JD, 2004 WL 166722, at *4 (D.N.H. \nJan. 23, 2004) (challenging New Hampshire’s foster care system’s failure to provide dental services). \n4 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 5 of 8    PageID #:\n1205\n  Here, there was a final fairness hearing; no side agreements exist (ECF No. \n130); and no objectors have appeared. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2), (3), (5). The remaining \nissues are whether (A) the Class members received reasonable notice, id. 23(e)(1); \nand (B) the settlement is “fair, reasonable, and adequate,” id. 23(e)(2). \nA.  Notice to Class Members \n  After my preliminary approval, the parties effectuated notice consistent with \ntheir proposed plan and sufficient to satisfy the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \ndue process. Prelim. Approval Order 17; Mot. for Final Approval 15–17. See Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 23(e)(1)(B) (requiring courts to “direct notice in a reasonable manner to all \nclass members who would be bound” by a settlement). The record indicates that the \nnotice practices were “reasonably calculated to reach the absent class members.” \nReppert v. Marvin Lumber & Cedar Co., 359 F.3d 53, 56 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal \ncitation omitted); accord Michaud v. Monro Muffler Brake, Inc., No. 2:12-cv-00353-\nNT, 2015 WL 1206490, at *10 (D. Me. Mar. 17, 2015). Moreover, no Class member \nfiled an objection, objected at the fairness hearing, or opted out of the settlement.6 \nAccordingly, the notices satisfy Rule 23(e) and due process. \nB.  Agreement Terms \n  To determine whether to finally approve the settlement, I consider whether it \nis “fair, reasonable, and accurate” based on the four factors enumerated under Rule \n \n6   The parties submitted detailed documentation of their notice practices. See Decl. of M.C. Nardi \nin Supp. of Joint Mot. for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement ¶¶ 3–7 (ECF No. 123-1) (describing \nthe notice and comment process); Aff. of B. Gutierrez in Her Capacity as Communication and \nCompliance Manager ¶ 4 (ECF No. 123-3) (describing the dissemination of the notice of proposed class \naction settlement); Pls.’ Summ. of Comments 2 (describing comments as “overwhelmingly positive and \nweigh[ing] strongly in favor of final approval of the proposed Settlement Agreement”). \n5 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 6 of 8    PageID #:\n1206\n23(e)(2), which I analyzed in my preliminary approval order. Prelim. Approval Order \n8–11. Because the parties assure me that “no new circumstances have altered the \nassessment of any factor” relevant to that analysis, Mot. for Final Approval 8, I now \nadopt the analysis contained in my preliminary approval order. Only two issues merit \nfurther discussion: (1) Class counsel’s requested attorney’s fees; and (2) the issue of \nthis Court’s continuing jurisdiction. \n1.  Attorney’s fees \n  In my earlier order, I found  the proposed attorney’s fee award of $675,000 \nreasonable at that preliminary stage. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(e)(2)(C)(iii); Prelim. Approval \nOrder 10. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(h) (providing that a court approving a class action \nsettlement agreement “may award reasonable attorney’s fees and nontaxable costs \nthat are authorized by law or by the parties’ agreement”); Noll v. Flowers Foods Inc., \nNo. 1:15-cv-00493-LEW, 2022 WL 1438606, at *8 (D. Me. May 3, 2022) (“It falls to the \ncourt to ensure that any award of attorney’s fee[s] is fair.”). Class counsel has since \nsubmitted additional documentation showing that the requested amount “represents \na significant reduction from the over $1 million amount that [they] could reasonably \nhave sought in a contested fee application.” Mot. for Final Approval 12; Decl. of M.C. \nNardi in Supp. of Joint Mot. for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement ¶¶ 12–17 \n(ECF No. 123-1) (calculating the amounts the Plaintiffs could have sought under a \nlodestar analysis applying either party’s proposed rates); see also App’x: Materials in \nSupp. of Pls.’ Fee Calculations (ECF No. 123-2). Moreover, as noted in my preliminary \n6 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 7 of 8    PageID #:\n1207\napproval order, I find the fees reasonable after reviewing those awarded in class \nactions concerning other states’ foster care systems. Prelim. Approval Order 10–11.7 \n2.  Retaining jurisdiction \n  Finally, I consider the provision of the parties’ Agreement concerning this \nCourt’s continuing jurisdiction over this action. See Agreement § IV.1.B. District \ncourts have authority to retain jurisdiction over a case when the “obligation to comply \nwith the terms of the settlement agreement ha[s] been made part of the order of \ndismissal—either by separate provision (such as a provision ‘retaining jurisdiction’ \nover the settlement agreement) or by incorporating the terms of the settlement \nagreement in the order.” Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, \n381 (1994); see also Commonwealth Sch., Inc. v. Commonwealth Acad. Holdings LLC, \n994 F.3d 77, 84 (1st Cir. 2021) (“[A] district court may retain jurisdiction to enforce a \nsettlement in a dismissed case as long as the order of dismissal either incorporates \nthe  settlement  agreement  or  explicitly  reserves  jurisdiction  to  enforce  the \nsettlement.”). Courts in this District frequently retain jurisdiction for the limited \npurpose of enforcing settlement agreements. See, e.g., Anderson v. Team Prior, Inc., \nNo. 2:19-cv-00452-NT, 2022 WL 16531690, at *7 (D. Me. Oct. 28, 2022); Venegas v. \nGlob. Aircraft Serv., Inc., No. 2:14-cv-249-NT, 2017 WL 2730025, at *4 (D. Me. June \n26, 2017). The parties also cite several out-of-circuit examples of courts retaining \n \n7   See, e.g., M.B. v. Tidball, No. 2:17-cv-4102-NKL, 2020 WL 1666159, at *2, 20 (W.D. Mo. Apr. \n3, 2020), aff’d sub nom. M.B. by Eggemeyer v. Tidball, 18 F.4th 565 (8th Cir. 2021) (awarding \n$3,253,651.25 in fees and $132,907.56 in expenses in a class action concerning a foster care system’s \nuse of psychotropic drugs that settled two years after filing); M.B. v. Howard, 555 F. Supp. 3d 1047, \n1092 (D. Kan. 2021) (awarding $2,225,306.64 in fees and $72,305.15 in expenses in a class action \ncomplaint concerning a foster care system’s mental health policies that settled 18 months after filing). \n7 \n\nCase 1:21-cv-00005-NT     Document 131     Filed 11/27/24     Page 8 of 8    PageID #:\n1208\njurisdiction in cases specifically involving claims against state foster care systems. \nMot. for Final Approval 17–18 (collecting cases). \n  Here,  I  exercise  my  discretion  to  approve  the  provision  on  continued \njurisdiction  based  in  part  on  its  temporal  and  substantive  limitations,  which  I \ndiscussed with counsel for both parties at the final fairness hearing. For example, \nthis Court’s jurisdiction will continue only “for as long as the Agreement remains in \neffect,” Agreement § IV.1.B., which is limited to “five . . . years from the date the \nImplementation Reviewer’s contract begins,” id. § IV.1.B.a. Any modification to that \nfive-year expiration date must be requested by the parties and approved by the Court. \nId. § IV.1.B.a.i.–ii. Moreover, the Court may only exercise its continuing jurisdiction \nfor the limited purpose of “enforc[ing] and ensur[ing] compliance with the terms of \nthe Agreement.” Id. § IV.1.B. See generally Mot. for Final Approval 17–19. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons stated above, I GRANT the parties’ joint motion for Class \ncertification, final approval of the Agreement, and attorneys’ fees and costs (ECF No. \n123). The case is DISMISSED without prejudice according to the terms of the \nAgreement. Without affecting this order’s finality, this Court shall retain jurisdiction \nover this matter consistent with the terms of the Agreement. \n \nSO ORDERED. \n              /s/ Nancy Torresen                                         \n            United States District Judge \nDated this 27th day of November, 2024. \n8 ",
