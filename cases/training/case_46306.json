    "summary": "<p>On March 21, 2025, the Trump administration officially terminated funding for legal representation for unaccompanied immigrant children. This case challenges this action.</p>\r\n<p>On March 26, 2025, Community Legal Services and other non-profit legal services and advocacy groups for immigrants and refugees filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), and the Department of the Interior (DOI). Plaintiffs alleged violations of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Represented by Immigrants Defender Law Center, Justice Action Center and Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, plaintiffs sought declaratory judgment and a nationwide injunction to compel the government to reinstate this funding and continue providing legal counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Araceli Martinez-Olguin.</p>\r\n<p>On March 27, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which Judge Martinez-Olguin granted the same day, effective through April 16, 2025. The TRO barred the government from terminating, suspending, or reducing funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children, and required the continued disbursement of funds to legal service providers at the levels in effect as of March 20, 2025. It also prohibited the implementation of any new policies or directives inconsistent with those funding obligations, pending resolution of a preliminary injunction motion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The same day, the government filed a motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order on the basis that there had been a significant change in controlling law, affirming the discretion of federal agencies to make funding determinations without judicial interference, following the Supreme Court&rsquo;s decision in Department of Education v. California.</p>\r\n<p>On April 4, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On April 7, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the temporary restraining order (TRO), alleging that the government had not complied with the court&rsquo;s order.</p>\r\n<p>On April 9, 2025, the government filed a motion for recusal of the district judge, asserting that Judge Martinez-Olguin was biased in favor of the plaintiffs because of her prior role as managing attorney at Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto.</p>\r\n<p>In light of the recusal motion, on April 10, 2025, the court extended the TRO through April 30, and scheduled a joint hearing on April 23, to consider both the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for preliminary injunction and the government&rsquo;s motion to dissolve the order.</p>\r\n<p>On April 12, 2025, the government appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit (docket 25-2358). Two days later, they sought a stay pending resolution of that appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied relief on April 18, holding that the time-limited TRO was not appealable. 2025 WL 1189827. On May 5, the court denied rehearing en banc.</p>\r\n<p>Back in the district court, Judge Martinez-Olguin denied recusal on April 17, 2025, stating that a judge's past employment at a plaintiff organization does not, by itself, create a presumption of bias. 2025 WL 1346877. Her reasoning was that the recusal statute requires more than a mere suggestion of prejudice. She also noted that the central issue for recusal is whether a judge was involved in the specific litigation as an advocate before taking the bench, not that they simply worked for a legal employer or practiced in a given area of law.</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, 2025 the district court granted the plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for a preliminary injunction. 780 F.Supp.3d 897. It held that the plaintiffs had standing and that the Tucker Act did not require the claims to be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, since they did not sound in contract. On the merits, the court found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on three Administrative Procedure Act theories. First, the court found that the government likely violated the TVPRA by cutting all funding for direct legal representation without any alternative plan to ensure unaccompanied children received legal counsel as required by statute. Second, the court held that ORR failed to follow its own regulations, which required the agency to fund legal services when appropriations were available and pro bono counsel was not feasible. Ending all funding, the court concluded, was inconsistent with this obligation. Third, the court determined that the decision was likely arbitrary and capricious because the government failed to provide a reasoned explanation supported by evidence and instead relied on post hoc attorney argument. Accordingly, the court enjoined the government from withdrawing ORR services or funding in place as of March 20, 2025, including funding for direct legal representation under the TVPRA and ORR&rsquo;s Foundational Rule. The injunction barred any cutoff of congressionally appropriated funds while it remains in effect.</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2025, the government appealed the preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit. Then, on May 13, the government filed a motion to stay the preliminary injunction, which the court denied on May 14. 137 F.4th 932. The court found that there was no Tucker Act obstacle to the suit and that the government had not demonstrated irreparable harm from the challenged injunction. The court denied the government&rsquo;s subsequent petition for rehearing en banc on May 26, over a dissent by Judges Bumatay and VanDyke, who raised concerns about judicial overreach and separation of powers.</p>\r\n<p>The government's appeal of the preliminary injunction remains pending in the Ninth Circuit, while the underlying case remains ongoing in the district court.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "On March 21, 2025, the Trump administration terminated funding for legal representation of unaccompanied immigrant children. Five days later, on March 26, 2025, Community Legal Services and allied immigrant advocacy groups filed suit in the Northern District of California, alleging violations of the TVPRA and APA and seeking injunctive relief. On March 27, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction; the court granted the TRO the same day, prohibiting termination of funding and requiring continued disbursement through April 16. That same day, the government moved to dissolve the TRO based on a change in controlling law. On April 4, plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction. On April 7, they moved to enforce the TRO, alleging noncompliance. On April 9, the government moved for Judge Martinez-Olguin’s recusal, citing her prior employment at Community Legal Services. The next day, the court extended the TRO through April 30 and scheduled a joint hearing for April 23. Meanwhile, the government appealed the TRO to the Ninth Circuit on April 12 and moved for a stay on April 14. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay on April 18, holding the TRO was not appealable. On April 17, the district court denied the recusal motion. Then, on April 29, it granted plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that plaintiffs had standing and were likely to succeed on three APA theories, including violations of the TVPRA and agency regulations. The order enjoined the government from withdrawing ORR legal services and funding in place as of March 20. The government appealed on May 1 and moved to stay the injunction on May 13. The Ninth Circuit denied the stay on May 14 and denied rehearing en banc on May 26. The appeal of the preliminary injunction remains pending, and proceedings continue in district court.",

The requested relief \nwould upend, not preserve, the longstanding management of legal services for \nunaccompanied alien children (“UAC”)—services that remain subject to available \nappropriations and the agency’s judgment. Even if the district court’s order were not \nbeyond the district court’s jurisdiction and the scope of the APA, as the Supreme \nCourt recently held in Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. ----, 2025 \nWL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam), a closely analogous case, such \nan order would be outrageous—overriding the relevant statute and regulation, as \nwell as the President’s authority to administer those authorities. And the injunction \nentered is all the more outrageous given the district court is irrefutably conflicted \nfrom  hearing  the  case  and  must  recuse.  Facing  a  motion  for  recusal  filed  by \nDefendants, the district judge extended the TRO and deemed consideration of her \nblatant conflict to be the basis for the extension. The district court order entered \nwithout jurisdiction by a judge with numerous conflicts imposes irreparable harms \non the government and should be immediately stayed.  \n1 \n\n(10 of 348), Page 10 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 10 of 348\nBACKGROUND \nOn March 20, 2025, United States Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”)  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement  (“ORR”)  directed  Department  of  the \nInterior (“DOI”) to partially terminate a contract previously funding direct legal \nrepresentation services. ECF Docket 31, Attachment 1 (Biswas Decl. ¶¶ 11–13), \nN.D.  Cal.  No.  25-cv-02847.2  This  termination  was  executed  through  a  formal\ndecision  memorandum  signed  by  the  DOI  Acting  Assistant  Secretary  of  the \nAdministration for Children and Families (“ACF”). Id. ¶¶ 13–14.  \nPlaintiffs are legal service providers. On March 26, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their \nComplaint  for  Declaratory  and  Injunctive  Relief  seeking  to  enjoin  the  partial \ncontract termination under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). Docket No. 1. \nOn March 27, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion and proposed order for a temporary \nrestraining order to “grant immediate provisional and nationwide relief enjoining” \n“Defendants from interfering with [certain statutory and regulatory] requirements to \nprovide direct legal representation services to unaccompanied children, including by \ncutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding.” Docket No. 7. On March \n31, 2025, Defendants opposed the motion, arguing, among other things, that the \nAPA does not waive sovereign immunity for the monetary relief that Plaintiffs seek, \n2 Docket citations are to No. 25-cv-02847 unless otherwise noted. \n2 \n\n(11 of 348), Page 11 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 11 of 348\nand that the district court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because the rights \nthey seek to enforce must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. Docket 24. \nOn April 1, 2025, the district court granted Plaintiffs’ Motion for Temporary \nRestraining Order. Docket 33. \nDefendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of March \n20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and ORR’s Foundational \nRule,  45  C.F.R.  §  410.1309(a)(4),  particularly  ORR’s  provision  of \nfunds  for  direct  legal  representation  services  to  unaccompanied \nchildren. This injunction precludes cutting off access to congressionally \nappropriated funding for its duration. \nIbid. The district court set the injunction to remain in effect until April 16, 2025, and \ndenied the government’s request for an injunction bond under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). \nIbid. \nOn April 4, 2025, Defendants moved to dissolve the temporary restraining \norder based on the intervening Supreme Court decision in Department of Education \nv. California, 2025 WL 1008354 at *1 (holding that “the government is ‘likely to\nsucceed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of \nmoney under the APA’” and requiring such cases to be transferred to the Court of \nFederal Claims), and to shorten time to hear the dissolution motion. Docket 38, 39. \nDefendants also asked for a stay of the temporary restraining order as alternative \nrelief.  On  April  7,  2025,  Plaintiffs  filed  an  emergency  motion  to  enforce  the \ntemporary restraining order. Docket 40. The district court granted the motion to \n3 \n\n(12 of 348), Page 12 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 12 of 348\nshorten  time,  and  ordered  status  reports  on  compliance  with  the  temporary \nrestraining order. Docket 42. On April 11, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a second emergency \nmotion to enforce the temporary restraining order. Docket 53.  \nOn April 9, 2025, Defendants filed a motion seeking recusal of the district \njudge. That motion contends that the district judge was required to recuse because \nshe was recently a managing attorney at Plaintiff Community Legal Services of East \nPalo Alto, and had publicly condemned President Trump’s immigration policies as \n“cruel,” meaning she had the appearance of bias. Moreover, the motion argued the \ndistrict judge could not review the case because she has personal knowledge of the \none Plaintiff’s budget and operations directly relevant to a disputed fact in this \ncase—namely, allegations regarding irreparable harm to the organization. Docket \n47. In that motion, Defendants asked the district court to vacate the TRO based on\nthe recusal requirement. \nOn April 10, 2025, the district court entered an order extending the temporary \nrestraining order to April 30, 2025, asserting that  \nBefore the Court is Defendants’ motion for recusal and reassignment. \nThe  Court  must  address  this  pending  motion  before  further \nconsideration of the case. Thus, the Court finds that consideration of \nthe motion for recusal constitutes good cause requiring extension of the \nTemporary Restraining Order dated April 1, 2025 (“TRO”). \nDocket 48. In other words, the district court found the recusal motion itself served \nas the “good cause” required to extend the TRO for an additional fourteen days.  \n4 \n\n(13 of 348), Page 13 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 13 of 348\nARGUMENT \nAn immediate stay pending appeal is warranted because the government can \ndemonstrate: (1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its appeal; (2) \nirreparable harm absent a stay; (3) that Plaintiffs will not be substantially harmed by \na stay; and (4) that the public interest favors a stay. Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. \n770, 776 (1987). \nThe district court’s order is fundamentally flawed. Although the district court \nis correct that it must adjudicate the recusal motion, that provides no excuse to extend \nthe plainly improper temporary restraining order where a recent Supreme Court \ndecision makes clear both that the district lacks jurisdiction and that the relief under \nthe APA that Plaintiffs seek here is foreclosed. Even if recusal were not a foregone \nconclusion under the circumstances here, Plaintiffs cannot prevail on the merits and \nwould not suffer irreparable harm  absent  a  TRO.  The  district court abused its \ndiscretion  by  refusing  to  dissolve  and  instead  extending  the  restraining  order, \nparticularly given that it rejected the government’s request for an injunction bond \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c), creating a grave risk that the government would be \nunable to recover public funds once they are paid to comply with this lawless order.  \nI. Defendants Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Appeal\nOn April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court directly addressed several of the issues\nin this case in Department of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354. In that \n5 \n\n(14 of 348), Page 14 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 14 of 348\ncase, a group of States challenged under the APA the termination of certain federal \ngrants. Id. at *1. A district court granted several States’ motion for temporary \nrestraining order and required the government to pay out past-due grant obligations \nand to continue paying obligations as they accrued. Ibid. The government appealed \nand moved for a stay pending appeal; the court of appeals denied the stay; and the \ngovernment filed an application with the Supreme Court to vacate the temporary \nrestraining order and requested an immediate administrative stay. Ibid. The Supreme \nCourt treated the government’s application to vacate the order as seeking a stay \npending appeal and granted the application. Id. at *2. \nIn its per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court held that the government was \nlikely to succeed in showing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order the \npayment of money under the APA, the relief sought by the States. Id. at *1. The \nSupreme Court stated that “the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend \nto orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’” as the district court had \nordered the government to continue, and that “the Tucker Act grants the Court of \nFederal Claims jurisdiction over [such] suits.” Ibid. It therefore stayed the district \ncourt’s temporary restraining order. \nThis Court should stay the district court’s order for the same reasons. As a \npreliminary matter, it is an appealable order. “Although the Courts of Appeals \ngenerally lack jurisdiction over appeals from TROs, several factors counsel in favor \n6 \n\n(15 of 348), Page 15 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 15 of 348\nof construing the District Court’s order as an appealable preliminary injunction.” \nIbid. Like the order in California, this order “carries many of the hallmarks of a \npreliminary injunction.” Ibid. The court held an adversarial hearing, and “the court’s \nbasis for issuing the order [was] strongly challenged.” Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. \n61, 86-87 (1974). And the order has the same “practical effect of granting … an \ninjunction,” as it ordered the reactivation of grants and disbursement of funds. Abbott \nv. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 594 (2018) (citation omitted).\nFurther, as in California, “the District Court’s ‘basis for issuing the order is \nstrongly challenged,’ as the Government is likely to succeed in showing the District \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.” California, \n2025 WL 1008354, at *1 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court made clear that \nfederal district courts lack jurisdiction over claims like Plaintiffs’—which ask a \ncourt “to order the payment of money under the APA” or “enforce a contractual \nobligation to pay money.” Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted). “Instead, the \nTucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any \nexpress  or  implied  contract  with  the  United  States.’”  Id.  (quoting  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a)(1).\nThose conclusions apply with equal force in this case. Plaintiffs proceeded \nunder the APA but sought monetary relief. And the district court issued an order “to \nenforce  a  contractual  obligation  to  pay  money”—the  sort  of  order  that  lies \n7 \n\n(16 of 348), Page 16 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 16 of 348\nexclusively in the province of the Court of Federal Claims. Id. (quoting Great-West \nLife & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002)). Defendants raised \nthese issues to the district court in their motion to dissolve the temporary restraining \norder on April 4, the same day the Supreme Court decided California. Yet the district \ncourt inexplicably extended, rather than dissolved, the TRO. Because Plaintiffs’ \nclaims are not cognizable under the APA, and rather must be brought in the Court \nof Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, the district court abused its discretion and \nDefendants are likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal.  \nIf that were not enough, the district court’s stated justification for extending \nthe temporary restraining order is patently insufficient. Defendants filed a recusal \nmotion on April 9, raising the prospect of serious conflicts of interest—conflicts that \nmay divest the district judge of authority over this case—for the court’s attention. \nSpecifically, Defendants explained that the district judge presiding over this case \npreviously worked as a managing attorney at Plaintiff Community Legal Services in \nEast  Palo  Alto  (CLSEPA).  That  experience  likely  provides  her  with  personal \nknowledge of CLSEPA’s alleged irreparable harm—that loss of funds will impact \nCLSEPA’s ability to operate—requiring recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1).  \nBut at minimum, it raises the prospect that a reasonable person would likely \nquestion her impartiality, making recusal proper under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). Those \nconcerns  are  particularly  acute  as  the  district  judge  did  not  disclose  her  prior \n8 \n\n(17 of 348), Page 17 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 17 of 348\nemployment to Defendants, who discovered it independently. Defendants further \nidentified further context that underscores the appearance of partiality: the district \njudge  has  made  various  statements  critical  of  President  Trump’s  immigration \nagenda, which underpins this case; and she has personally served as co-counsel with \nat least one of Plaintiff’s lawyers in previous cases involving child migrants. These \nfacts raise serious questions about the appearance of impartiality here.  \nYet  rather  than  vacating  its  temporary  restraining  order—which,  as \nDefendants explained, would be the proper remedy for a void order entered by a \ndistrict judge required to recuse, see Liljeberg v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., \n486  U.S.  847,  870  (1988)—the  district  court  used  the  pending  disqualification \nmotion as its sole justification for extending that order. See Docket 48 (“The Court \nmust address this pending motion before further consideration of the case. Thus, the \nCourt finds that consideration of the motion for recusal constitutes good cause \nrequiring  extension  of  the  Temporary  Restraining  Order  dated  April  1,  2025 \n(“TRO”)). It cannot be that the prospect that an order is void provides good cause to \nextend that same order. And the district court offered no other justification for \nextending the temporary restraining order, which may only have effect beyond 14 \ndays  if  “the  court,  for  good  cause,  extends  it.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  65(b)(2)  (also \nproviding that the “reasons for an extension must be entered in the record”).  \n9 \n\n(18 of 348), Page 18 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 18 of 348\nDefendants are therefore likely to succeed on the merits of their appeal. This \nCourt  should  vacate  or  stay  the  district  court’s  temporary  restraining  order \nimmediately. \nII. Continuing  irreparable  harm  to  the  United  States  supports  an\nemergency stay of the temporary restraining order\nThe  injunction  imposes  irreparable  harm  on  the  government  and  public, \nwhose  interests  merge  here.  See  Nken  v.  Holder,  556  U.S.  418,  435  (2009). \nWhenever a district court issues a universal injunction against the Executive Branch, \nthe  United  States  suffers  a  form  of  irreparable  harm.  The  President  is  “a \nrepresentative of the people” and holds “the mandate of the people to exercise his \nexecutive power.” Myers v. United States 272 U.S. 52, 123 (1926). The government \nhas a substantial interest in carrying out the President’s policies. Courts play an \nimportant role in adjudicating the lawfulness of those policies in justiciable cases, \nbut they irreparably injure our democratic system when they forbid the government \nfrom  effectuating  those  policies  against  anyone  anywhere  in  the  Nation.  Cf. \nMaryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). And \nthose  concerns  are  heightened  when,  as  here,  the  injunction  undermines  the \nExecutive Branch’s constitutional and statutory authority over immigration and the \nadmission of aliens, and thereby constitutes an “unwarranted judicial interference in \nthe conduct of foreign policy.” Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 116 \n(2013).  \n10 \n\n(19 of 348), Page 19 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 19 of 348\nAnd even separate from the government’s sovereign interests, the temporary \nrestraining order requires the government to disburse public funds that will be spent \nand never recovered. Again, this case mirrors California, in which the district court \nentered a stay pending appeal. “No grantee ‘promised to return withdrawn funds \nshould its grant termination be reinstated,’ and the District Court declined to impose \nbond.” California, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1. The government is therefore “unlikely \nto recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.” Id. \nIII. The balance of the equities and the public interest favor a stay\nFinally,  Plaintiffs  are  unlikely  to  suffer  irreparable  harm  if  the  Court’s\ntemporary restraining order is stayed pending appeal. Plaintiffs have not asserted \nthat they will have to cease operations if funds are withheld for the duration of the \ntemporary  restraining  order—which  is  less  than  one  month.  Nor  have  they \nestablished any other source of certain, immediate irreparable harm; the “risk” of \nlosing staff or expertise they cite is speculative.  \nAnd the public interest favors a stay. As explained above, injunctions against \nthe government work substantial harm to the public interest when they forbid the \ngovernment from effectuating the policies of democratically-elected leaders—and \neven more so when those injunctions apply against anyone anywhere in the Nation. \nFurther, this order, issued without complying with Rule 65’s bond requirement, \nwould  require  the  government  to  pay  out  taxpayer  funds  with  no  prospect  of \n11 \n\n(20 of 348), Page 20 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 20 of 348\nrecovering those funds if it ultimately prevails in the litigation. That concern is \nheightened when the order at issue was entered by a judge whose background \nsuggests serious concerns about the appearance of impartiality.  \nThe public interest is further served here by respecting Congress’s deliberate \npolicy choice to route claims sounding in contract or seeking to recover monies to \nthe Court of Federal Claims. And it is disserved by orders, such as that entered \nbelow, that flout Congress’s deliberate choice to vest exclusive jurisdiction with the \nCourt of Federal Claims. \nThe equities and public interest therefore favor a stay.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant an emergency stay of the temporary restraining order \npending  appeal.  Given  that  Plaintiffs  are  imminently  seeking  to  enforce  that \ntemporary  restraining  order,  this  Court  should  also  grant  an  immediate \nadministrative  stay  while  it  considers  the  government’s  request  for  a  full  stay \npending appeal. \n12 \n\n(21 of 348), Page 21 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 21 of 348\nRespectfully submitted, \nYAAKOV M.

But on March 21, 2025, Defendants abruptly terminated this long-standing\nfunding for direct legal representation for these unaccompanied children.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nseek a temporary restraining order preventing Defendants from violating the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) by illegally ceasing funding for direct legal representation services for \nunaccompanied  immigrant  children  in  violation  of  8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(5)  and  45  C.F.R. \n§410.1309(a)(4).\nPlaintiffs request that this motion be heard on an expedited basis.

Absent intervention from legal services providers, \nthey are forced to navigate our country’s complicated immigration processes alone.  Plaintiffs are \na group of legal services providers who provide congressionally mandated legal representation and \nservices to UCs in a variety of immigration proceedings.  Recognizing the importance of this \nrepresentation, Congress has appropriated funding for them since 2012, and continuing through \nSeptember 2027.  Nonetheless, on March 21, 2025, Defendants abruptly cancelled direct legal \nrepresentation  for UCs  under the  contract effectuating  Congress’s mandate.   Without  these \ncongressionally mandated funds, Plaintiffs face the impossible choice of continuing to represent \ntheir UC clients in violation of Defendants’ order and without compensation, or abandoning their \ncore functions. \nRecognizing that children navigating complicated legal proceedings need counsel, in 2008, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them \nin legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(5).    In  keeping  with  that  mandate,  Congress  has  funded  direct  legal \nrepresentation for UCs since 2012.  In 2024, acknowledging its responsibility to provide these \ncongressionally mandated legal  services, ORR issued its Unaccompanied Children Program \nFoundational Rule (“Foundational Rule”) and bound itself to funding legal services providers, so \nlong as congressional appropriations were available.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).   \nOn March 21, 2025, Defendants ordered an immediate stop to the representation work in \nclear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Defendants have provided no \n1 \n\n(35 of 348), Page 35 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 35 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 34\ninformation as to how or if they will now comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations. \nDefendants have also provided no information to Plaintiffs about how they should deal with their \nongoing commitments to represent UCs (including UCs with immigration court dates as soon as \nthis week).  As a result, Plaintiffs must choose between several intolerable options:  continuing to \nrepresent their clients without compensation, drawing down precious or scarce discretionary or \nreserve funding, cutting other organizational services, laying off or terminating experienced staff, \nor seeking to withdraw from representation, thereby abandoning their child clients in the middle \nof legally complex immigration proceedings they likely cannot navigate alone.  Defendants’ \nactions are contrary to congressional and regulatory mandate and are arbitrary and capricious \nbecause they violate their own regulatory obligations.  To prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, \nto say nothing of irreparable harm to their UC clients, this Court should enjoin Defendants’ attempt \nto terminate direct legal representation for UCs under the APA.  \nThis Court should expedite consideration of this motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a) and \ngrant immediate provisional relief enjoining Defendants’ illegal action, which is creating ongoing \nand irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and their clients.   \nBACKGROUND \nA. Thousands of Unaccompanied Children Rely on Legal Representation Every Year to\nExercise Their Legal Rights\nIn the 2024 fiscal year alone, nearly 100,000 new children were identified by federal \nauthorities as UCs and referred to ORR.  ORR, Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Fact Sheet \n(March 7, 2025), https://acf.gov/orr/fact-sheet/programs/uc/fact-sheet.  These children’s journeys \nto the United States may differ, but all of them are now in the United States without their parents \nor guardians.  William A. Kandel, et al., CRS Report R43628, Unaccompanied Alien Children: \nPotential Factors Contributing to Recent Immigration, at 3, 10 (2014).  Of the UCs who moved \n2 \nStay Motion Addendum 011\n\n(36 of 348), Page 36 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 36 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 34\nthrough ORR custody in 2024, nearly a quarter were 12 years old or younger.  ORR, Fact Sheets \nand Data, supra. \nGiven their inherent vulnerabilities, UCs have special legal rights, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§1232(a)(5)(D), including the right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the\nConvention Against Torture and voluntary departure.  Many UCs also have the right to apply for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), which offers a path to lawful permanent resident status \nbut requires state court proceedings that require counsel.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(j).  UCs may \nalso pursue asylum before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in a non-adversarial process \nwithout  being  subject  to  the  one-year  filing  deadline  applicable  to  adults.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§1158(b)(3)(C).  But these rights are meaningless unless children are educated about their rights\nand equipped with the tools to exercise them, including legal counsel.  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 \n(Apr. 30, 2024).  Unaccompanied children primarily learn about and exercise their rights through \neither full legal representation or limited-scope assistance from a lawyer—often, until March 21, \n2025, an attorney funded by Defendants, and provided by Plaintiffs. \nB. Congress Has Directed HHS to Ensure Unaccompanied Children Have Legal Counsel\nCongress  has  recognized  that  UCs  are  uniquely  vulnerable  to  trafficking,  abuse  in \ngovernment custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system.  Through the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, Congress gave Defendants Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”) and ORR legal custody of UCs, with the mandate to care for the children.  See 6 U.S.C. \n§279(g)(2).  Congress also commanded Defendants HHS and ORR to “develop[] a plan to be\nsubmitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is timely \nappointed to represent the interests of each such [unaccompanied] child.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A).  \nActing on this congressional command, in 2005, ORR developed a three-year pilot program to \nmeet the legal needs of UCs through provision of pro bono legal services.  At the end of the pilot \n3 \nStay Motion Addendum 012\n\n(37 of 348), Page 37 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 37 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 34\nprogram in 2008, a summary report detailed that volunteer attorneys alone were not sufficient to \nmeet  the  representation  needs  of  UCs.    See  Olga  Byrne  &  Elise  Miller,  The  Flow  of \nUnaccompanied  Children  Through  the  Immigration  System,  at  22–23  (March  2012), \nhttps://shorturl.at/KI3Jt.  The report concluded that paid attorneys would be required to cover a \nsignificant  percentage  of  the  representation  that  UCs  needed,  spurring  Congress  to  impose \nadditional representation-related requirements on ORR and HHS through the William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 \n(“TVPRA”).  \nThe TVPRA, which Congress passed in 2008 and has regularly reauthorized since then \n(most recently in 2023), mandates that HHS must provide counsel for UCs: “The Secretary of \nHealth  and  Human  Services  shall  ensure,  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  . . .  that  all \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary \nof Homeland Security . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters.”  8 \nU.S.C. §1232(c)(5) (emphasis added).  Defendants have violated this mandate. \nC. ORR’s Own 2024 Regulations Require Funding for Legal Services for Unaccompanied\nChildren Consistent with Available Appropriations.\nORR has recognized “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \nChildren Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, 2024).  On April 30, \n2024, ORR issued the final “Foundational Rule,” which codified in part HHS’s 1997 Flores \nsettlement.   Id.  Section 410.1309 of the final rule, titled “Legal Services,” affirms ORR’s position \n1 The Flores settlement, entered into by the federal government and four noncitizen children in \n1997, sets forth requirements regarding the care of UCs while in ORR custody.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34386. \n4 \nStay Motion Addendum 013\n\n(38 of 348), Page 38 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 38 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 34\nthat “legal services providers who represent unaccompanied children undertake an important \nfunction” and  explains  ORR’s goal  of “100 percent  legal  representation of unaccompanied \nchildren.”  Id. at 34526.   \nThe Foundational Rule requires that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund \nlegal  service  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children.”2  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  To comply with the TVPRA and the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  the  rule  recognizes  ORR  must  “ensure  that  all \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \nthat “[t]o the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not \npracticable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide \ndirect immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s \ndiscretion and available appropriations.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), (d).   \n2 Congress has also required ORR to compile and provide lists of legal services providers \n“qualified  to  provide  guardian  and  attorney  representation  services”  for  UCs.    6  U.S.C. \n§279(b)(1)(I).  The Foundational Rule also binds ORR to working with qualified legal services\nproviders to provide orientations and consultations for UCs.  (a)(2)(i)(A).\n5 \nStay Motion Addendum 014\n\n(39 of 348), Page 39 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 39 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 34\nrelease services . . . including . . . access to legal services.”  Id. at 168.  Finally, the Senate Report \nexpressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund counsel for UCs:  “The \nCommittee also expects these funds will be used to provide access to counsel, consistent with the \ngoals of the [TVPRA] of 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration \nproceedings.”  Id. at 169.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the same levels for \nUC legal representation.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. \nL.119-4, div. A, tit. I, § 1101(8) (2025)).  From December 2023 until March 21, 2025, Defendants\nsatisfied this obligation through contracting with Acacia Center for Justice, who contracted with \norganizations like Plaintiffs to provide direct legal representation for unaccompanied children. \nD. Defendants Terminate Funding for Direct Legal Representation for Unaccompanied\nChildren.\nDespite Congress’s consistent funding of legal representation for UCs as mandated by the \nTVPRA, Defendants’ actions undermine congressional appropriations, the TVPRA’s mandate, \nand ORR’s Foundational Rule.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent a letter titled “Notice of \nPartial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” (the “Cancellation Order”) to the Acacia \nCenter for Justice, the prime contractor on this contract, who then notified Plaintiffs of the \ntermination.  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for direct legal \nrepresentation for UCs—both in and out of ORR’s custody—as of close of business that day, \nignoring the requirement to fund these programs under the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  \nThe letter further commanded the Plaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on any of the active \nrepresentations of UCs and to stop taking on new engagements.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; VAAP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Up until the March 21 letter, Defendants enabled legal services providers, including \nPlaintiffs, consistently to provide direct and ongoing representations to tens of thousands of UCs \nin proceedings, including removal and SIJS proceedings.  The letter provided no explanation for \n6 \nStay Motion Addendum 015\n\n(40 of 348), Page 40 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 40 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 34\nthe termination nor guidance on how to handle existing representations, including those with \nimminent court hearings.  Defendants were silent as to whether providers could continue existing \nrepresentations (unfunded), despite the stop-work direction, or must withdraw immediately and (if \ngranted) be forced to leave their clients in the lurch.  See NWIRP Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11; VAAP Decl. ¶¶ \n12, 13, 21; Estrella Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 19.  \nThis is not the first time that Defendants have acted to halt the legal representation of \nunaccompanied children.  About a month earlier, on February 18, 2025, Defendant Department of \nthe Interior (“DOI”) and Defendant HHS issued an “Immediate Stop Work Order,” ordering legal \nservices providers—including Plaintiffs—to indefinitely “cease all services” and “stop all work” \nfor active legal services.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; MIRC Decl. ¶ 21; Public Counsel \nDecl. ¶ 10; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11.  Although Defendants rescinded the stop work \norder three days later, Defendants’ drastic actions spurred 32 Senators to sign a letter expressing \n“strong opposition” to the stop work order and noting its violation of the TVPRA.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11; see Senator Mazie K. Hirono, \nLetter to HHS and Interior on Legal Services for Children in Immigration System (March 3, 2025), \nhttps://shorturl.at/RcUr3. \nDespite this strong opposition and TVPRA’s mandate, Defendants terminated funding on \nMarch 21, 2025, and have further provided no information about whether or how they intend to \nreplace these critical legal services for UCs.  Terminating funding for these legal services has \ndevastating and irreparable effects on Plaintiffs, which are all the more devastating for the harm \nthey will do to UCs.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 7.  For example, VAAP previously furloughed two of its \nthree direct legal service practitioners on staff after the February stop work order, leaving the \nremaining practitioner to bear two additional full caseloads at a time.

See Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc., 240 \nF.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining the analysis for a TRO and preliminary injunction\nare “substantially identical”).  A temporary restraining order is warranted where the plaintiffs \nestablish:  (1) their likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) the balance of \nequities tips in their favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  All. for the Wild \nRockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)); see also Stuhlbarg, 240 F.3d at 839 n.7 (applying preliminary injunction \nstandard to a temporary restraining order).  Where the government is the defendant, the last two \nfactors merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nARGUMENT \nAgency action cannot stand if it is contrary to law.  Because Defendants’ termination of\ndirect  legal  representation services is  contrary to  the TVPRA and ORR’s own  regulations, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n8 \nStay Motion Addendum 017\n\n(42 of 348), Page 42 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 42 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 34\nA. The Cancellation Order Determines Plaintiffs’ Legal Rights and Obligations and is\nFinal Agency Action Reviewable Under the APA.\nThe APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public \nand their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 \n(1992).  Persons or organizations, like Plaintiffs here, who are “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, [are] entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “[A]gency action” includes not \nonly agencies’ affirmative acts, but also their omissions and failures to act.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). \nUnder the APA, this Court may set aside and enjoin unlawful agency action, and compel \nagency action unlawfully withheld, if it is a (1) “final agency action,” (2) “for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court,” so long as (3) there are no “statutes [that] preclude judicial \nreview” and “agency action is [not] committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), \n704. Plaintiffs satisfy each of these criteria here, and APA relief is therefore proper.\nFinal Agency Action.  Under the APA, “agency action” is defined as “the whole or a part\nof an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to \nact.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13); 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(2).  An agency action is final where two conditions \nare satisfied: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess,” and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n(quotation marks and citations omitted). \nDefendants’ refusal to fund or otherwise provide direct legal representation for UCs is a \nfinal agency action.  See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (attempt to “pause” funding and disbursements constituted final agency \naction).  Immigrant Defenders Law Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, No. 2:21-\n9 \n\n(43 of 348), Page 43 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 43 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 34\ncv-00395, Dkt. 304 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 14, 2025), is instructive.  In that case, plaintiffs alleged that\nthe Department of Homeland Security unlawfully denied the rights guaranteed by the TVPRA \nfrom unaccompanied children who had previously been processed under the Department of \nHomeland Security’s Migrant Protection Protocols Policy (“MPP”), despite having entered and \nbeen designated as UCs.  Id. at *21–22.  The court held that plaintiffs met the first requirement \nbecause “nothing in the record indicates that the Policy is tentative or that decisionmaking is \nongoing.”  Id. at *18. As to the second, the court found the policy at issue was final because it was \n“an agency action ‘from which legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. at *19 (quoting Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 178). \nHere, Defendants clearly ceased funding direct legal representation to UCs in violation of \nan express statutory mandate and their own regulatory frameworks.  The Cancellation Order \ndirected Plaintiffs to stop all work providing direct legal representation to UCs, including existing \nclients whom Plaintiffs undertook to represent before the Cancellation Order.  This notification is \nfinal:  it terminates all funding for and orders a halt to all direct legal representation, leaving only \nfunding for certain Know Your Rights (“KYR”) presentations and confidential legal consultations.  \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 13; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 11.  That order went \ninto effect immediately on March 21, 2025. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs are forced to choose between continuing to provide unfunded legal \nrepresentation  in  the  face  of  extremely  limited  resources;  cutting  other  vital  organizational \nprograms, laying off, furloughing, or terminating staff; or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing \nrepresentation duties for court hearings, client meetings, and other important preparations for legal \nproceedings as soon as this week.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21.  The longer Plaintiffs go without this funding \nor clarity regarding how to handle their current clients, the fewer services they can provide as they \n10 \nStay Motion Addendum 019\n\n(44 of 348), Page 44 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 44 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 20 of 34\nare forced to withdraw from ongoing representations, cut other core programs, and/or lay off or \nreassign staff.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 20–22; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 14.  Institutional knowledge will be \npermanently lost if significant numbers of experienced staff are laid off, irreparably damaging the \nPlaintiffs’ capabilities, regardless of whether funding is ever reinstated.  Thus, this termination \nundeniably has an immediate effect on parties’ rights or obligations.  \nNo Other Adequate Remedy.  Plaintiffs do not have any other adequate remedy for their \nclaims.  The Supreme Court narrowly interprets the “other adequate remedy” limitation, stressing \nthat it “should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of \njudicial review of agency action.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988); see also \nChang v. United States, 327 F.3d 911, 923 (9th Cir. 2003) (“generous” APA review provisions \nmust be given “hospitable” interpretation (citing Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140, 141 \n(1967))).  Instead, “Congress intended by that provision simply to avoid duplicating previously \nestablished special statutory procedures for review of agency actions.”  Darby v. Cisneros, 509 \nU.S. 137, 146 (1993).  Here, no such special procedures have been established.   \nNo Statutory Bar to Review.  Finally, no statute bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims here, and \nCongress has done nothing to override “the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial \nreview”  of  the  administrative  actions  Plaintiffs  challenge.    Bowen  v.  Mich.  Acad.  of  Fam. \nPhysicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986). \nB. Termination of the Legal Representation Programs Violates the TVPRA.\nUnder the TVPRA, Congress requires that the government “shall ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and \nto  “protect  them from  mistreatment,  exploitation,  and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  \nCanceling funding for and ordering stoppage of direct legal representation services to UCs violates \n11 \n\n(45 of 348), Page 45 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 45 of 348\nan express congressional mandate.  The Cancellation Order should be held unlawful and set aside.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(2)(A).  \nThe TVPRA, requiring Defendants to “ensure [UC legal representation] to the greatest \nextent  practicable,”  precludes  them  from  terminating  the  legal  representation  program  and \nnullifying its congressionally appropriated funding under circumstances here.  See, e.g., Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 655075, at *18 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (government agencies violated the \nAPA when they withheld appropriated funds when agencies were “required, ‘to the extent of \navailable  appropriations,’  to  ensure  provision  of  support  services  for  resettled  refugees”).  \nDefendants terminated this funding and ordered Plaintiffs to cease UC client representation \nwithout providing any other avenues of legal services for UCs—failing to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that UCs have legal counsel in their immigration proceedings.  Defendants’ \nCancellation Order effectively ends meaningful legal representation for UCs by Plaintiffs and \nforecloses other providers from providing similar legal representation.  VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 20–21. \nAlthough the TVPRA grants Defendants some discretion in how to allocate appropriated \nfunds for legal access, Defendants cannot simply cease funding for direct legal representation in \nits entirety.  See Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18.  That is precisely what happened here: \nDefendants cut off funding for direct legal representation services without providing any guidance \nor explanation to Plaintiffs regarding how they should deal with their ongoing representations and \nwithout any alternative plan for implementing their duties under the statute.  Amica Decl. Ex. 3. \nUltimately, canceling the programs defies express congressional mandates in both the \nTVPRA and appropriations bills.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n118-47, § 4, 130 Stat. 460, 461 (incorporating the explanatory statement published at  170\nCongressional Record H1501-01, which in turn incorporates Senate Report No. 118-84).  Out of \n12 \nStay Motion Addendum 021\n\n(46 of 348), Page 46 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 46 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 34\nthe $5,506,258,000 the Senate Report specified for the UCP, the Report recommended “no less \nthan the fiscal year 2023 funding level for post-release services; legal services and access to \ncounsel; and child advocates,” and that such “funds will be used to provide access to counsel, \nconsistent with the goals of the [TVPRA].”  S. Rep. 118-84 at 167–70 (2023) (emphases added).   \nAfter mandating in the TVPRA that Defendants provide legal representation to UCs “to \nthe greatest extent practicable,” Congress facilitated the provision of legal representation by \nappropriating billions of dollars to the UCP program, which includes (among other services) direct \nlegal representation to UCs.  By consistently appropriating funds for this program for more than a \ndecade, Congress not only ensured that it would be practicable to provide legal representation to \nUCs, but also expressly intended to ensure this outcome.  Given that appropriations are available \nto fund access to direct legal representation, Defendants cannot, consistent with their TVPRA \nobligations, simply refuse to fund such representation.   \nC. Terminating the Legal Representation Programs Violates the ORR Foundational Rule.\nThe government also is “bound by the regulations it imposes upon itself.”  See United \nStates v. 1996 Freightliner Fld Tractor VIN1FUYDXYB-TP822291, 634 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. \n2011).  “Where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their \nown procedures.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974).  Under the Accardi doctrine, parties \nmay bring claims under the APA asserting that an agency has failed to follow its own rules and \ninternal policies.  See, e.g., Alcaraz v. I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  Accardi \nconcerned the failure by the Board of Immigration Appeals to exercise its independent discretion \nin deciding an appeal as required by the agency’s own regulations.  See United States ex rel. \nAccardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266–67 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds.    \n13 \nStay Motion Addendum 022\n\n(47 of 348), Page 47 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 47 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 34\nOtro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024) (plaintiffs \nsufficiently alleged a policy violation based on a rule preamble and alleged substantial hardship \nbased on border turnback policy); see also Carnation Co. v. Sec’y of Lab., 641 F.2d 801, 804 n.4 \n(9th Cir. 1981) (the standard for an Accardi violation is “whether violation of the regulation \nprejudiced the party involved”).  Here, Defendants’ actions violate their express commitment in \nthe Foundational Rule, a binding regulation, to fund legal services providers to provide UC legal \nrepresentation as long as appropriations are available.  Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced \nbecause they rely on that funding to provide critical legal services to UCs and will, in some cases, \nbe forced to stop providing that representation to their UC clients.  Plaintiffs will have to choose \nbetween financial survival and adhering to binding ethical obligations as to existing clients if \nDefendants’ actions are not enjoined.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 14; Estrella Decl. ¶ 15; see also infra \nSection II.A.  \nORR has “recognize[d] that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34529; see also Al Otro Lado, 2024 WL 4370577, at *9 (preambles may sufficiently bind agencies \nunder Accardi).  Accordingly, ORR just last year stated its intention to provide “universal legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children by FY 2027.”  HHS: Administration for Children & \nFamilies,  Justification  of  Estimates  for  Appropriations  Committees,  at  78  (2024), \nhttps://shorturl.at/4VDSL; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 34526 (“ORR strives for 100 percent legal \nrepresentation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to the extent \npossible.”).  Thus, in 2024, ORR adopted the Foundational Rule, which states in relevant part: \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is \nnot practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service \n14 \nStay Motion Addendum 023\n\n(48 of 348), Page 48 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 48 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 34\nproviders  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations. \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  ORR explicitly noted that “in some cases it is \nimpracticable for ORR to secure pro bono legal services for unaccompanied children,” and \nprovided that ORR would fund legal services with available congressional appropriations for those \ncases.  89 Fed. Reg. at 34529.  The Foundational Rule thus explicitly obligates ORR to fund legal \nservices providers to provide direct immigration legal representation, so long as congressional \nappropriations are available and pro bono counsel is not practicable.  See id. at 34529 (“ORR has \ndetermined that its approach to providing legal services to unaccompanied children by enabling \nthem to access pro bono counsel ‘to the greatest extent practicable’ and funding legal services for \nadditional  unaccompanied  children,  as  resources  allow,  is  consistent  with  ORR’s  statutory \nobligations.”).  \nDefendants’ actions on March 21, 2025, subvert these ORR commitments and regulations, \nviolate the Accardi doctrine, and are both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 411 F. Supp. 3d 1036, 1068–69 (C.D. Cal. \n2019).  Congressional appropriations are readily available until September 2027 to fund these legal \nservices, including funds appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025.  See, e.g., Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) \n(2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. \n460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  Nonetheless, without explanation and without a plan \nto replace these critical legal services, the Cancellation Order violates Defendants’ obligations and \nhas caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs substantial hardship, as described below.  See also \ninfra Section II.A.  Because Defendants’ actions violate their own stated policies and substantially \nprejudice Plaintiffs, the termination order should be enjoined.   \n15 \n\n(49 of 348), Page 49 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 49 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 25 of 34\nII. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements for Injunctive Relief\nA. Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm\nA temporary restraining order is appropriate where, as here, the moving party shows that \nit faces irreparable harm—harm which is (1) “immediate”, Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. \nBaldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988), and (2) “for which there is no adequate legal remedy.”  \nAriz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nHere, immediate injunctive relief is necessary to protect Plaintiffs from suffering severe \nand irreparable harm.  Defendants’ abrupt termination of funding for direct legal representation \ndirectly interferes with Plaintiffs’ missions, immediately impeding their ability to provide critical \nlegal representation that is at the heart of Plaintiffs’ core activities.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 22; VAAP \nDecl.  ¶¶ 21–22;  NWIRP  ¶¶  13–15.    There  is  no  question  that  ceasing  funding  for  legal \nrepresentation services for UCs and terminating the existing services will cause imminent harm \nthat cannot be later remediated.  MIRC Decl. ¶ 32–33; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 37.  The Cancellation Order \nprevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of unaccompanied children with the direct legal \nrepresentation  required  under the TVPRA and the Foundational  Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ \n16 \nStay Motion Addendum 025\n\n(50 of 348), Page 50 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 50 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 26 of 34\nprimary mission of representing these children as contemplated by Congress and the TVPRA.  See, \ne.g., ImmDef Decl. ¶ 2.  If this occurs, “‘there can be no do over and no redress.’”  League of\nWomen Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting League of Women Voters \nof N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014)).   \nPlaintiffs have relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding for these \ncritical resources will continue to be available.  Amica Decl. ¶ 11; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 18.  Cutting \noff this vital resource threatens immediate and irreparable harm.  See, e.g., CLSEPA Decl. ¶ 13; \nVAAP Decl. ¶¶ 22–24; KIND Decl. ¶¶ 16–19.  For example, Immigrant Defenders Law Center \nhas already had to provide 27 staff with layoff notices in response to the Cancellation Order and \nanticipates additional cuts would be necessary if funding is not restored; these staff losses threaten \nits ability to continue representing the 1900 UCs it currently represents.  ImmDef Decl. ¶¶ 20–22. \nIn Texas, Estrella del Paso currently manages 324 pending cases and predicts the loss of funding \nwill require staff layoffs and increase caseloads for existing staff.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6.  The \nGalveston-Houston Immigration Representation Project expects to lay off most of their Immigrant \nChildren and Youth staff within four weeks.  GHIRP Decl. ¶ 21.  Sustaining these services without \nthis funding will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Private providers predict devastating financial consequences, including the potential for \nbankruptcy.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 19; MM Decl. ¶ 18.  And these losses do not even account for the \norganizational knowledge at risk of being lost.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 38; Amica Decl. \n¶ 25; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 21.     \nThese  harms  cannot  be  remediated  or  redressed,  even  if  Defendants  later  provide \nalternative routes for providing direct legal representation for UCs.  The harm to Plaintiffs and \ntheir clients is imminent and irreparable.  The termination of services took effect immediately upon \n17 \nStay Motion Addendum 026\n\n(51 of 348), Page 51 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 51 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 27 of 34\nreceipt of Defendants’ letter on March 21, 2025, which provided no guidance as to what Plaintiffs \nshould do with their existing obligations, including immigration court hearings scheduled for this \nweek.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 15; Amica Decl. ¶ 20; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs have ethical obligations \nto their clients and cannot simply immediately withdraw from representation; indeed, most \nattorneys will require court permission to withdraw.  FIRRP ¶ 34.  Plaintiffs and their clients are \nalready experiencing irreparable harm far exceeding the mere loss of funding, including because \nthey have to furlough or layoff staff and increase the caseloads of staff who can stay on.  After \nlimited reserves run out, Immdef will be forced “to take drastic action to terminate staff across all \npositions  funded  under  this  contract.”  Immdef  Decl.  ¶  21.    Similarly,  KIND  “anticipate[s] \nsignificant layoffs, starting within days” after the termination of funding.  KIND ¶ 16.  Children’s \nimmigration cases “are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly skilled attorneys \nto competently handle them.”  Id. at ¶ 23. Impacted attorneys and staff have years of individualized \nexperience and wisdom with clients, making rehiring after layoffs impracticable.   \nThe imminent potential harms to children are immediate and severe.  For example, “if a \nchild at one of the ORR-subcontracted facilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal \nneed such as an outstanding removal order, Amica Center—the only legal provider with access to \nthe ORR-subcontracted facility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to \nprotect the child from imminent removal.”  Amica Decl. ¶ 21.  Further, “[a]t this very moment, \nthere are children in ORR custody who need our representation who are not receiving it.  This \nmeans that children who want voluntary departure will have their return home unacceptably \ndelayed, victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections they deserve, and children \nfleeing persecution will not be able to have their day in court.”  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 25.  The Court \n18 \n\n(52 of 348), Page 52 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 52 of 348\ncannot later reset the clock.  Absent a temporary restraining order Plaintiffs will suffer harm that \ncannot later be fixed.  \nB. The Balance of Equities\nFinally, in considering whether to grant a temporary restraining order, the Court should \n“balance the competing claims of injury and . . . consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 \n(9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)).  Where an \ninjunction will not “substantially injure the other [interested] parties,” the balance of equities tips \nin plaintiffs’ favor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \nHere, there will be no harm to Defendants if this Court issues a temporary restraining order: \nthe Government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Instead, “there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”  State v. Azar, 385 F. Supp. \n3d 960, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds and remanded sub nom. California ex rel. \nBecerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Newby, 838 F.3d at 12) (cleaned up). \nTerminating funding for direct legal representation for UCs, without any plan to ensure \nthat current representations are not interrupted, violates Congress’s express directive in the \nTVRPA and ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.  Enjoining Defendants from \neffectively terminating these services merely prevents Defendants from defying these mandates \nand shirking their own voluntarily undertaken obligations.  Paying out funds already appropriated \nfor these services cannot harm Defendants in any meaningful way compared to the harms that \nPlaintiffs and their clients will suffer if this Court does not issue a temporary restraining order.   \n19 \nStay Motion Addendum 028\n\n(53 of 348), Page 53 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 53 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 29 of 34\nMaintaining funding for these direct legal representation services furthers critical public \ninterests: ensuring children have access to legal representation and protection from trafficking, as \nwell as promoting efficiency and fairness within the immigration system for thousands of children \nwho have viable claims for immigration relief in the United States.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 34529 \n(recognizing benefit of UC representation to the immigration system generally).  Plaintiffs’ work \nwith UCs is widely recognized and commended by the legal community writ large, including by \nImmigration Judges, clerks, and the Department of Homeland Security’s field office staff.  VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 11; MIRC Decl. ¶ 19; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 13. The programs promote judicial economy by \npreventing immigration courts from bearing expenses such as unnecessary status conferences, \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 11, terminating proceedings for children where jurisdiction is improper, VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 9; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 10, and efficiently funneling contact with the courts through a single \npoint of contact rather than having 50 or more representatives reaching out individually, MIRC \nDecl. ¶ 19.  Plaintiffs play a key role in ensuring that children’s needs are being met while in ORR \ncustody.  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, Plaintiffs make referrals to Child Advocates, advocate \ndirectly with ORR to avoid unnecessary “step ups” for children at risk of being placed in more \nrestrictive detention settings, and request Trafficking Victim designations from the Office of \nTrafficking in Persons.  Id.  Because Plaintiffs are independent, non-governmental organizations, \nchildren often share concerns with Plaintiffs they do not feel comfortable sharing with ORR-\nsubcontracted staff or other stakeholders.  Id.  A temporary restraining order enjoining the \nCancellation Order is in the public interest.   \nIf the Court does not issue a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs and the thousands of \nUCs they represent will face clear, immediate, and irreparable harms.  Defendants themselves, \nmeanwhile, do not face any injury from the issuance of a temporary restraining order to stop their \n20 \n\n(54 of 348), Page 54 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 54 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 30 of 34\nillegal action.  Given these considerations, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of \nissuing a temporary restraining order here. \nIII. A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate\nWhile injunctive relief must be tailored to the scope of the case, “there is no bar against . . . \nnationwide relief in federal district or circuit court when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal v. Brock, 843 \nF.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 1987).  Moreover, “an injunction is not necessarily made over-broad by\nextending benefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is \nnot a class action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they \nare entitled.”  Id. at 1170–71.  Accordingly, “when a reviewing court determines that agency \nregulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their application \nto the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640,681 \n(9th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  The appropriate injunctive relief “often depend[s] as much on the \nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l. Refugee \nAssistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579–80 (2017).   \nHere, because “the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff,” a nationwide injunction is necessary \nto provide Plaintiffs complete relief.  See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); Doe #1 \nv. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1069 (9th Cir. 2020) (nationwide scope of injunction proper to provide\ncomplete relief).  Defendants’ decision to terminate direct legal representation directly violates the \nTVPRA and the Foundational Rule as to every legal services provider and will cause irreparable \nharm if allowed to proceed.  A nationwide injunction is the only way to effectively grant Plaintiffs \nthe relief they seek: the preservation of their mission to provide critical legal services for UCs \nacross the country who would otherwise be left to navigate the immigration system alone.  It is \nalso the only way to ensure that Defendants comply with the congressional mandate and their own \n21 \n\n(55 of 348), Page 55 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 55 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 31 of 34\nregulatory obligations to provide legal representation to UCs to the greatest extent practicable \nWithout a nationwide injunction, Defendants may continue to deny funding to other nonprofit \norganizations providing similar services, preventing thousands of UCs from  receiving legal \nrepresentation and assistance, and forcing Plaintiffs to make an impossible choice between serving \ntheir mission unfunded or turning their backs on vulnerable clients.  Plaintiffs, whose primary \nmission and core organizational activities include critical direct legal representation for these \nchildren, will be forced to either deplete their reserves by continuing to provide as much direct \nlegal representation services as possible or turn their backs on vulnerable clients.  Notably, \nDefendants—who, consistent with congressional appropriations, already allocated funding for \ndirect legal representation—will not face any harm from a nationwide injunction requiring them \nto continue funding legal representation as planned.  Thus, the balance of equities weighs heavily \nin favor of a nationwide injunction. \nCourts have recognized that “a fragmented immigration policy would run afoul of the \nconstitutional and statutory requirement for uniform immigration law and policy.”  Washington v. \nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2017).  “For these reasons, in immigration cases, [this \nCourt] consistently recognize[s] the authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a \nuniversal basis.” E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681 (quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nMoreover,  plaintiffs  are  located  throughout  the  country,  and  “[d]ifferent  interpretations  of \nexecutive policy across circuit or state lines will needlessly complicate agency and individual \naction,” see E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681, and piecemeal injunctive relief for the more than \n80 providers nationwide would be impractical and difficult to administer.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, \n985 F.3d 309, 326–27 (4th Cir. 2021).

See, e.g., Pacesetter, Inc. v. Aortech Intl. PLC, 2012 WL 12894007, at *1 \n(C.D. Cal.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.   \n \n1.  My name is Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu. I am a licensed attorney and a member in good \nstanding in the State Bar of Arizona. I am currently employed as Deputy Director of the \nFlorence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (“Florence Project” or “FIRRP”). I joined \nthe Florence Project on September 6, 2016, and have served in my current role since \nSeptember 2024. Before I assumed my current position, I previously served as Children’s \nLegal Program Manager, Managing Attorney for the Children’s Pro Bono Program, Pro \nBono Mentor, Staff Attorney, and Law Graduate with the Florence Project's Children’s \nLegal Program serving unaccompanied immigrant children in Arizona.  During my time \nat the Florence Project, I have personally provided free legal services, including friend of \ncourt services, direct representation, legal orientation and education, and pro bono \nmentorship, to at least 140 children. Additionally, as Children’s Legal Program Manager \nand Deputy Director I have supervised attorneys, pro bono volunteer attorneys, law \ngraduates, accredited representatives, legal assistants, intake specialists, and social \nworkers who have provided free legal services, both direct representation and pro se \nservices, to thousands of individuals detained in Office of Refugee Resettlement “ORR” \nand ICE custody in Arizona. \n \nFlorence Project’s Mission and Scope\n \n2.  Founded in 1989, the Florence Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit legal services \norganization with offices in Tucson, Phoenix, and Florence, Arizona. The Florence \nProject’s mission is to provide free legal and social services to detained adults and \nchildren facing immigration removal proceedings in Arizona. On any given day, there are \nthousands of people detained and facing deportation proceedings in Arizona, including \nadults in rural detention centers in Eloy and Florence, Arizona and unaccompanied \nchildren who are or were previously in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(“ORR”) in shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. With no public \ndefender structure in immigration removal proceedings, the vast majority of people \nfacing removal are forced to go unrepresented in immigration court due to poverty or lack \nof access to counsel, this includes unaccompanied children who are in the country \nwithout a parent or legal guardian. The Florence Project’s vision is to ensure that all \nimmigrants facing removal have access to counsel, understand their rights under the law, \nand are treated fairly and humanely. \n \n3.  The Florence Project is the sole 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing \nfree immigrant legal services to unaccompanied children in Arizona. Through our \nattorneys, accredited representatives, law graduates, intake specialists, legal assistants, \nsocial workers, and network of pro bono attorneys, the Florence Project provides free \nStay Motion Addendum 042\n\n(67 of 348), Page 67 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 67 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 19\nlegal education and free representation and social services to thousands of \nunaccompanied children who are facing deportation proceedings in Arizona.  \n \nFlorence Project’s Services Under the Unaccompanied Children’s Program \n \n4.  The Florence Project began providing legal services to unaccompanied children who \nwere detained and facing deportation proceedings in Arizona in 2000. At the time, \nunaccompanied children were detained in the custody of the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, (“INS”), the same agency that managed adult immigration \ndetention and removal, in jail-like facilities in Central Arizona. Those facilities were ill-\nequipped to manage the special needs of children and children regularly suffered harmful \ntreatment–for example, routine strip searches before attorney visits, prolonged detention, \nplacement in solitary confinement, and other restraints. In 2002 as part of the general \nrestructuring of immigration enforcement under the Homeland Security Act, and in \nrecognition of the special needs of children, Congress moved away from the adult \ndetention model and transferred the care and custody of unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren to the Office of Refugee Resettlement “ORR”. At or about that same time, \nchildren began to be detained in shelter facilities in the Phoenix area. The Florence \nProject subsequently opened an office in Phoenix to better facilitate serving these \nunaccompanied child clients. In 2014, ORR opened additional shelters in the Tucson area \nand, again, the Florence Project opened a Tucson office to serve those clients. The \nFlorence Project has continuously served unaccompanied children detained in Arizona \nsince 2000.     \n \n5.  As it pertains to unaccompanied children, in order to carry out our mission of providing \nfree legal and social services to unaccompanied children facing removal proceedings in \nArizona, the Florence Project’s Children’s Legal Program and Children’s Social Services \nTeam has a number of main work components that involve providing unaccompanied \nchildren with legal education and know your rights presentations, legal screenings, legal \nadvocacy, friend of court assistance, and direct representation both from Florence Project \nattorneys and through pro bono placements. Each of these facets of Florence Project’s \nwork is addressed in more detail below.   \n \n6.  First, the foundational level of our services to unaccompanied children are based on \nproviding age-appropriate legal education services and “know your rights” presentations \nand conducting individual legal screenings(intakes) with all unrepresented children in \nORR custody in Arizona. Under the UCP, Florence Project staff ensure that every \nunaccompanied child who is detained in ORR custody in Arizona receives age-\nappropriate, basic “know your rights” information and an intake in a language they \nunderstand within 10 business days of their arrival in an Arizona ORR shelter facility, \nwhere possible, in keeping with 45 CFR 410.1309(a)(2)(i)(B). For children who are \nreunified to a sponsor before Florence Project staff are able to meet with them, staff call \nthe child and provide a know your rights presentation and intake over the phone. Every \nyear, Florence Project staff provide these educational services to tens of thousands of \nchildren in Arizona; in 2023 alone, Florence Project staff provided 17,514 \nStay Motion Addendum 043\n\n(68 of 348), Page 68 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 68 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 19\nunaccompanied children with a “know your rights” presentation.  These are critical \nservices because unaccompanied children almost universally lack resources to afford \nlegal representation and, without the Florence Project, would not have meaningful access \nto accurate and age-appropriate resources to help them understand their rights, \nresponsibilities, or legal options.  \n \n7.  Second, Florence Project attorneys also attend every detained Unaccompanied Minor \nchildren's docket in the Phoenix and Tucson Immigration Courts and, where allowed by \nthe judge and appropriate, serve as Friend of Court for any cases in which the child is still \nseeking and likely to attain reunification with a sponsor or family member, and the Court \nrequires additional information to assess next steps. Because the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) requires that unaccompanied children “be \npromptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” \nmany of the children to whom we provide educational “know your rights” services \neventually reunify with sponsors elsewhere in the United States. As a result, Florence \nProject staff do not immediately enter as counsel on every child’s case in Arizona, but we \ndo ensure that no child is alone in court by being present and to help provide critical \ninformation to the Court regarding the status of the reunification process, best language, \nspecial vulnerabilities and other critical information, where appropriate and allowed by \nthe Court.   \n \n8.  Third, the Florence Project provides non-representational legal advocacy for non-\nrepresented children in ORR custody. This includes advocating with ORR shelters for \nthings like communication in the proper language, access to medical care, religious \naccommodations, access to education, access to proper food, access to communication \nwith family and sponsors, and access to counsel. Through this type of non-\nrepresentational advocacy, the Florence Project works to ensure that children in ORR \ncare are being treated with dignity, respect, and are not subject to discrimination or \nmistreatment, and that the shelters are abiding by laws surrounding the treatment of \nchildren.  \n \n9.  Fourth, every year Florence Project attorneys provide direct representation to hundreds of \nunaccompanied children in Arizona; in 2023 alone Florence Project attorneys represented \n1,091 unaccompanied children in Arizona. Excepting cases of ethical conflict, Florence \nProject attorneys represent all unaccompanied children who are placed into Long-Term \nFoster Care (“LTFC”) facilities in Arizona, as well as other unaccompanied children who \nremain in ORR custody during their removal proceedings or as they approach “aging-\nout” of the age of minority by turning 18. Additionally, Florence Project attorneys \nrepresent unaccompanied children who have passed through ORR custody and reunified \nwith family members or sponsors here in Arizona, or have been placed in the \nUnaccompanied Refugee Minor Program in Phoenix, AZ. In all these cases, Florence \nProject’s representation of these unaccompanied children can include representation \nbefore the Immigration Courts and the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”), as well as representation in Arizona State Court juvenile or probate \nproceedings where necessary and appropriate for children who have been abandoned, \nabused, or neglected.  \nStay Motion Addendum 044\n\n(69 of 348), Page 69 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 69 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 19\n \n10. Fifth, Florence Project also has two specialized direct representation teams, which are \npartially funded by UCP. The first is the Children’s Trafficking Response Team, which \nworks to educate and guide staff and community stakeholders and partners on how to \nidentify and support child survivors or trafficking, or children at risk of trafficking. This \nteam is partially funded by UCP and works directly with unaccompanied minors who are \nat risk of or have survived trafficking, whether in the U.S., their country of origin, or on \ntheir journey to the U.S. The second in the Released Representation team which focuses \non providing direct legal and social services to children who were formerly detained by \nORR and living in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  \n \n11. The Sixth and final major component of the Florence Project’s Children’s Legal Program \nis our Children’s Pro Bono Team, who receive pro bono case referrals from Children’s \nProgram staff and then connect unrepresented unaccompanied children with pro bono \ncounsel from law firms or pro bono private immigration practitioners. Each year, our pro \nbono team places dozens of cases with volunteer attorneys before the immigration court, \nUSCIS, Arizona state courts, and Board of Immigration Appeals and provides full-\nservice mentorship, ongoing training, and technical support on those cases. Pro bono \nscreening and mentorship in cases before the agency also are funded and conducted, \nthrough the UCP contract. \n \n12. As of February 28, 2025,  the Florence Project provided free legal services to \nunaccompanied children at 24 shelters located in the State of Arizona, primarily in the \nPhoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. These shelters have a combined capacity to \ndetain over 2,000 children on any given day. Of these, 18 facilities are located in \nMaricopa County and 6 are located in Pima or Pinal counties. These shelters include 3 \nLTFC facilities as well as 3 transitional foster care facilities that serve particularly \nvulnerable or special needs populations such as children under the age of 13, siblings \ndetained together, teens who are parenting or pregnant, and children with special needs.  \nUnaccompanied children in Arizona with active immigration court cases generally are \ndocketed on either the Phoenix or Tucson immigration court dockets and, as noted above, \nFlorence Project staff ensure that no detained unaccompanied child in Arizona stands \nalone in immigration court, either by representing children or being present to provide \nFriend of the Court services as deemed appropriate and approved by the Court.  \n \n13. The Florence Project currently employs 114 full time staff who are dedicated to directly \nproviding services under the UCP and whose positions are largely funded through U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding. Specifically, Florence \nProject employs 1 Program Manager and 1 Associate Program Manager as well as 9 \nmanaging attorneys, 9 managing legal assistants, and 1 managing social worker who \ndirectly oversee and train staff providing UCP legal services, help manage legal and \ncontractual compliance, and directly provide legal services under the UCP themselves. \n \n1 On February 28, 2025, Florence Project staff began to learn of “stop placement orders” and an accompanying \ndepopulation of various shelters we have historically served. The reason, scope, and anticipated duration of the stop \nplacement order and accompanying depopulation remain unclear at this time as do any possible plans for opening \npotential replacement shelter services in our region.   \nStay Motion Addendum 045\n\n(70 of 348), Page 70 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 70 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 19\nAdditionally, Florence Project employs 21 staff attorneys and law graduates, and 4 \naccredited representatives who provide direct representation, legal consultation, and legal \neducation and screenings under the UCP;  1 pro bono Managing Attorney who oversees \nthe Pro Bono Program, screens volunteer attorneys, places cases, and supervises the Pro \nBono team, and 2 pro bono mentors who provide technical support to pro bono attorneys;  \n49 legal assistants and intake specialists who help provide know your rights presentations \nand legal screenings under attorney supervision; 9 social workers; and 3 legal \nadministrative assistants who support the team with UCP related data entry and billing \nrequirements.  Due to staff turnover, internal transitions, and promotions, the Florence \nProject also has 20 open positions that are contemplated under the Florence Project’s \nUCP that we have yet to backfill. In addition to our regular full-time employees noted \nabove, the Florence Project also currently hosts 3 Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) \nfellows and one Equal Justice Works (“EJW”) Fellow who work in conjunction with our \ngeneral staff to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings.   \n \n14. Staff providing representation and “know your rights” presentations to children in ORR \nfacilities routinely travel to each of the 24 shelter facilities in person to conduct client \ninterviews and screenings, prepare clients for hearings, as well as provide legal \neducation, legal screenings, and other legal support to detained children. Florence Project \nstaff are typically present in shelters anywhere from 3-5 days a week. The Florence \nProject represents unaccompanied children in removal proceedings in immigration court, \naffirmative relief such as seeking asylum before USCIS, U-visas and T-visas, Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) applications both before the agency and in state \ncourts for necessary predicate orders, BIA appeals, and petitions for review to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  \n \n15. For every child that passes through ORR in Arizona, the Florence Project monitors to \nmake sure that the child is on track for reunification with a sponsor. If the shelter \nindicates that a child does not have a sponsor, or if the child has been detained for an \nextended period of time, or if the child’s case merits entering of representation, the \nFlorence Project will place the case with an in-house attorney or accredited \nRepresentative, or with a volunteer pro-bono attorney from the community. \n \n16. The Florence Project currently directly represents over 800 children under the UCP \ncontract. Some are children still in detention, and many are children who have been \nreleased from ORR and are living in Arizona, and have been waiting for their cases to be \nresolved for years due to government backlogs. Some cases take up to 6 years to \nconclude at the Legal Permanent Resident stage, and the presence of an attorney is \ncritical during that long time span since Immigration Law changes at a rapid rate. \n \n17. These various services provided under the UCP, from education through full \nrepresentation are a critical safety net for unaccompanied children who are or have been \nin ORR custody. The children the Florence Project serves are often extremely vulnerable \n– they have often experienced significant trauma, have been abused, abandoned, or \nneglected. Many have experienced discrimination, trafficking, or harm in their country of \norigin or en route to the United States. We routinely work with children who identify as \n\n(71 of 348), Page 71 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 71 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 19\nLGBTQ. We also regularly work with children who are experiencing symptoms of \nsignificant disabilities including mental health conditions as well as medical disabilities \nthat can directly impact their ability to participate in proceedings, for example vision or \nhearing impairment. Moreover, some of our child clients are very young such that their \nage presents unique barriers to their ability to participate in their legal cases. The \nFlorence Project also serves facilities that specialize in young or “tender aged” children \nunder the age of 13, where the children we at times encounter children who are so young \nthat they do not know even their parent’s names (aside from “mom” or “dad”). Florence \nProject staff have even represented children who were pre-verbal, with at least one client \nwho was only six-months old. For such individuals, the UCP is a critical safety net since, \nwithout the UCP, the vast majority of these particularly vulnerable children would be left \nwithout any information and most likely would face significant barriers to adequately and \nefficiently preparing their cases without counsel, nor would a child be well-positioned to \npay the thousands of dollars required to retain counsel. Indeed, almost universally, \nunaccompanied children lack sufficient resources and knowledge to obtain private \ncounsel and the Florence Project is the only non-profit organization that provides free \nlegal services to unaccompanied children who are detained by ORR in Arizona. Without \nthe services the Florence Project provides under the UCP, unaccompanied children in \nArizona would be forced to go through their legal process entirely alone, without a \nlawyer. However, immigration law is famously complex and given the \neducational/literacy barriers, language barriers, developmental stage barriers, age \nbarriers, and emotional and mental hurdles caused by past discrimination, trauma, and \nharm, the vast majority of our child clients would be simply incapable of navigating their \nlegal proceedings without assistance from trusted, independent legal and social service \nproviders like the Florence Project. Additionally, a significant number of the children we \nwork with are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), which requires \nproceedings and findings before state juvenile courts, which children simply cannot \nobtain without the assistance of counsel.   \n   \n18. Looking at SIJS in particular is useful to understanding how complicated and specialized \nthe work the Florence Project does with unaccompanied minors is. SIJS requires \nattorneys to be well-versed and competent to represent clients in not one, but two \ncomplicated areas of law: immigration removal defense and state court child welfare \nprocesses, which vary from state to state. In Florence Project’s experience, not only do \nour advocates need to be completely fluent in both areas to advocate in individual client’s \ncases, but historically we have had to do a great deal of education for both the state courts \nand the immigration courts about what the other side of the coin looks like and how the \nother court system operates. This requires regular stakeholder outreach, developing \nstrong relationships with courts, and participating in opportunities to educate judges and \ncourt staff, extending even to formal trainings where courts have requested such support, \nto ensure cases that involve both systems are able to move forward effectively and \nefficiently.  \n \n19. In addition to representing clients in their immigration proceedings, Florence Project \nrepresents clients in various forms of advocacy that arise incident to their custody. In this \ncontext, Florence Project staff play a critical role in building trust with clients and being a \n\n(72 of 348), Page 72 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 72 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 19\nconstant, dependable point of contact who is independent and not part of the United \nStates government, which allows these vulnerable youth to share information regarding \nabuse or mistreatment these children have experienced both before, during, and after their \ncustody by the U.S. government. Because we build this trusting connection with the \nchildren we serve, Florence Project clients have not only felt comfortable sharing \nexamples of abuse and violence they experienced in their countries of origin and during \ntheir journeys to the United States that are critical to developing their legal cases for \nrelief here in the United States, but also regularly share information about abuses they \nexperienced while in the custody of the United States government.  \n \n20. Examples of the types of abuses our unaccompanied children clients have reported to us, \nand about which the Florence Project has engaged in advocacy on our clients’ behalf, \ninclude lack of access to proper food, religious services, regular communication with \nparents or potential sponsors, clothing, hygiene items, parenting ability, and appropriate \nmedical care in both Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) and ORR custody; verbal and \nphysical assaults in CBP custody; physical abuse and sexual assaults in ORR custody; \nand attempted trafficking and/or grooming by ORR staff. Because we begin working with \nthese children within days of their arrival into ORR custody, Florence Project staff often \nare the first to learn about harmful government policies – things like widespread family \nseparations in 2017-2018 and the unlawful use of dental imaging as the sole basis to \nredetermine a child’s age as a justification for moving a minor into adult ICE custody. \nBecause we are independent legal service providers, we have the unique ability to \nadvocate on our clients’ behalf to raise awareness and push back against such harmful \npolicies.  \n \n21. For example, Florence Project staff screen each child for abuse or mistreatment at CBP \nfacilities prior to their arrival in ORR through questions designed to ensure that \nchildren’s legal rights are respected and that children are treated humanely by CBP. \nMany children the Florence Project encounters report being held for extended periods of \ntime beyond that allowed by the TVPRA, lacking proper food, being held in ice-cold \nfacilities or cages, having possessions, including religious items and medical items \nremoved, and being verbally and physically abused by CBP officers. We have heard \nstories of young mothers not being provided with blankets or diapers for their babies. In \nfact, over the last year alone, the Florence Project has documented over 150 complaints \non behalf of children and filed at least 30 formal complaints with the Office of Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties to seek official review and redress over abusive treatment or \nconditions children face while in CBP custody.2 For many children, it can take some time \nbefore they feel willing to open up regarding abuse or harm they have experienced. \nLimiting funding for legal service providers like the Florence Project to exclusively know \nyour rights presentations and intakes, will limit opportunities for Florence Project staff to \nbuild the type of trusting relationship with these children that enables children to feel \n \nStay Motion Addendum 048\n\n(73 of 348), Page 73 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 73 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 19\nsufficiently safe to disclose abuse experienced, particularly abuse experienced at the \nhands of U.S. Government officials. This will create circumstances that put children in \nincreased danger of abuse and harm by government officials and allow abusive CBP \nofficials to continue to act with increasing impunity, emboldened by the knowledge that \nchildren will have few, if any, opportunity to report harm or resources necessary to do so \nin a way that would potentially result in any accountability. This directly undermines the \nFlorence Project’s mission to ensure that all people facing deportation are treated fairly \nand humanely. Florence Project’s ability to build meaningful trusting relationships with \nunaccompanied children under the UCP helps our staff identify disturbing patterns and \ntrends in the types of abuses our children clients report. The role of possible \nrepresentation is particularly crucial in cases where serious trends of harm appear, as was \nthe case, for example, when Florence Project staff were some of the first to note and blow \nthe whistle on how the Trump administration’s “Zero Tolerance” border prosecution \npolicy resulted in widespread separations of minor children from their parents at the \nborder. The type of public advocacy and media that eventually brought a halt to that \negregious family separation policy is only possible under portions of the UCP that allow \nfor additional legal services and representation, a fact that is surely not lost on this second \nTrump administration in this decision to eliminate all portions of funding that allowed the \nFlorence Project to advocate for our children clients in this way.     \n \n22. Beyond advocating for our clients when they have experienced more extreme abuses and \nharm while in ORR or CBP custody, Florence Project staff also routinely support clients \nwith other types of advocacy which are equally necessary to ensure the rights of \nvulnerable children are properly respected. This type of advocacy can include advocating \nfor less restrictive or more appropriate placements in custody as well as the least \nrestrictive placement when a child turns 18. It also includes advocating for access to \nproper medical care and treatment in custody – from everything for advocating that a \nclient with vision impairment be given glasses so they could see, to advocating that a \nclient with serious medical condition such as a coma is placed in a facility that is \nequipped to care for their needs.  We help our clients file complaints with oversight \nagencies to document and resolve myriad of issues that arise as a result of our clients’ \ncustody and vulnerable status.  \n \n23. Many of our child clients also speak languages other than English or Spanish and our \nstaff not only provide them with legal services and education in a language they \nunderstand, as required by the Foundational Rule, but also advocate that they have \nappropriate language access in immigration court as well as other spaces, including ORR \ncommunications and medical appointments. For example, our child clients frequently \nreport to Florence Project staff that ORR staff insist on communicating with them in \nSpanish, despite that fact the child does not speak Spanish or prefers another language. \nChildren also report to Florence Project staff being discriminated against by shelter staff \nfor speaking indigenous language, or African languages. Many indigenous children or \nchildren who are part of a minority have experienced discrimination at home due to their \nethnicity, race, or national origin, and it can be difficult for them to advocate for \nthemselves for access to communication in their best language, especially if the shelter \nstaff are displaying prejudice or discrimination against them. Ensuring that \nStay Motion Addendum 049\n\n(74 of 348), Page 74 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 74 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 19\ncommunication takes place in the appropriate language that a child understands is critical \nand this is even more true when shelters or judges are attempting to share important \ninformation with the child. Florence Project staff not only regularly advocates that \nimportant government communications be conducted in the child’s best language, but \nalso meet with children in detention, build trust with our clients, and empower them to \nassert their language rights themselves. \n  \n24. Florence Project staff also often advocate for the medical needs of children. Florence \nProject staff have seen countless examples of ORR not taking adequate measures to \nprotect the health of children. Attorneys have advocated for visits to medical \nprofessionals who were able to diagnose conditions requiring surgery or medication, \nincluding for broken arms and necessary blood transfusions. Staff have learned of special \nmedical needs from children that the shelter did not know about, which resulted in \nchildren receiving life-saving treatment. Staff have advocated for proper dental care for \nchildren who had a difficult time eating due to mouth pain. Children have also reported \nORR staff misrepresenting the purpose of medical visits, children being told they are \ngoing to routine dental appointments only to later learn that the dental exams were \nactually completed for the purposes of age redetermination to facilitate transferring \nminors into adult ICE custody. Staff have also pushed back in cases where ORR was \nattempting to pressure minors to return to home country before proper medical care could \nbe assured for things like traumatic brain injuries, or other conditions.  \n \n25. The Florence Project also regularly advocates for First Amendment protections, \nparticularly access to religious activities, including ensuring that children are taken to \nservices, are given the proper diet, and are provided with adequate space and time to \ncomplete religious rites. Children who observe fasting have been denied food after \nbreaking fast, have had nighttime prayers interrupted, and have faced discrimination at \nthe hand of ORR staff for their religious observances. In such cases, the Florence Project \nplays a critical role as an independent third party able to both identify potential first \namendment and civil rights violations and empower our child clients to assert their rights \nas well.      \n \n26. Florence Project staff also frequently work with ORR and shelter staff to ensure that \nshelter staff refrain from the unauthorized practice of law. ORR staff are not legally \ntrained and are not lawyers with the associated privilege and confidentiality – they are not \nable to advise children as to their legal rights or counsel them on their legal options. \nDespite these known facts and rules against unauthorized practice of law, in many cases \nORR staff have provided legal advice to children, which more often than not has been \nincorrect, harmful, or contrary to the child’s wishes.  Florence Project attorneys regularly \ncorrect mistakes by ORR staff, for example, when ORR staff submit case assistance \nrequests through the Office of Trafficking in Persons (“OTIP”). The Florence Project has \nobserved countless cases where ORR staff’s submission was denied due to a lack of \nunderstanding of the requirements of an OTIP request for assistance, the child’s life, the \nlegal definitions of trafficking, or a combination thereof. In such cases, Florence Project \nattorneys have re-submitted requests and received OTIP approvals for case assistance for \nchildren who have rightly been determined to be survivors of severe forms of trafficking.  \nStay Motion Addendum 050\n\n(75 of 348), Page 75 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 75 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 19\n \n27. The Florence Project has long enjoyed a cooperative stakeholder relationship with our \nArizona immigration courts. Beginning from the initial call to action by an Immigration \nJudge that led to the creation of the Florence Project, Immigration Judges in Arizona \nhave consistently engaged with and welcomed the Florence Project’s legal education \nservices. In the context of unaccompanied children, both the Phoenix and Tucson \nImmigration Courts have a long history of working collaboratively with the Florence \nProject. For example, in both courts this cooperative stakeholder relationship has allowed \nfor the coordination of specialized dockets for unaccompanied children. The Florence \nProject has worked with the court and individual judges to ensure the children’s docket \nare as child-friendly as possible, with one judge even electing to wear a more informal \nHawaiian shirt instead of the traditional black robes. For decades, the vast majority of \njudges on the children’s docket have welcome Florence Project attorneys to serve as \nfriend of court to assist the court by sharing important information, such as updates \nregarding likelihood and timeline of reunification, the child’s best language, and other \ninformation necessary to properly and efficiently adjudicate children’s cases.  This \ncooperation has included everything from willingness to provide Florence Project staff \nspace in the physical courtrooms to conduct pre-court orientations to children before their \nhearings, to smaller acts of appreciation, including swearing in Florence Project law \ngraduates into the bar. Judges in Phoenix and Tucson have long relied on the Florence \nProject as a resource to which they may refer respondents who are confused or unclear \nabout the next step in their immigration court process. Judges in Phoenix have also \nallowed the Florence Project to serve as friend of court over the Government’s objection, \nin acknowledgement of the critical information provided for children’s cases. In both \nEOIR and ICE stakeholder meetings, government partners routinely express thanks and \nemphasize the value of the services the Florence Project provides.  \n \n \nUCP Stop Work Order, Stop Work Recission, and Subsequent Termination of all but \nCLIN 1 Funding Under UCP Contract \nStay Motion Addendum 051\n\n(76 of 348), Page 76 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 76 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 19\nremain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes \noutside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication of poor \nperformance.”  \n \n29. On February 18, 2025, shortly after receiving the stop work notice, Florence Project \nleadership promptly notified all staff regarding receipt of the UCP stop work order and \nprovided additional specific instruction to staff who provided services under the UCP \nclarifying how they would need to change aspects of their work to follow that order. \nHowever, because the Florence Project’s mission is to provide free legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children in Arizona, we also immediately began to discuss \nhow we could potentially transition the critical services that had been conducted under \nthe UCP to other legal access mechanisms, specifically legal access as envisioned by \nprovisions of the TVPRA mandating that “to the greatest extent practicable...that all \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of [HHS or DHS] \nhave counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \nmistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” As such, we also provided instruction to staff \non how we envisioned ensuring continuity of legal and social services for children in \nORR shelters served by the organization without government funding, at least for the \nshort term.  \n \n30. Just three days after it was abruptly issued, the UCP stop work order was just as abruptly \nrescinded on February 21, 2025. Like the original stop work order, the cancellation of \nsaid order came via email notification from the UCP prime contractor and the actual \nrecission order from the government contracting office provided little to no information \nas to why the stop work order had been issued originally or why that decision had now \nbeen reversed. It simply stated that the stop work order had been cancelled and that all \nactivities under the contract could be resumed.   \n \n31. In the three-day window in which the UCP stop work order was in effect, Florence \nProject staff were consistently allowed to continue to access our child clients in ORR \ncustody without interruption from shelter or ORR staff using our own funds to support \nthis work. As of this date, it is not clear what, if any, reimbursement for those services \nFlorence Project will receive.  \n \n32. On March 21, 2025, again without warning, the Florence Project learned that HHS \nthrough the U.S. Department of Interior contracting officer, terminated almost all aspects \nof the current UCP contract. Again, the Florence Project learned about the nearly \ncomplete termination of services under the UCP contract through an email notification \nfrom the government prime contractor on the UCP program, the Acacia Center for \nJustice, at approximately 8:15 a.m. Arizona time. The termination was effective the same \nday we received it, March 21, 2025. As noted, HHS terminated the contract with respect \nto three of the four contract line numbers (“CLINs”): CLIN 2, which funds legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children, as well as shelter advocacy and other non-\nrepresentation services, such as pro bono referrals, friend of court services, and data \nStay Motion Addendum 052\n\n(77 of 348), Page 77 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 77 of 348\ntracking3; (3) Attorney recruitment project and IJC fellows; and (4) Spanish language \ninstruction and interpretation. CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who \nrepresent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, which funds \nSpanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. For the time \nbeing, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR custody. Per the termination, \nHHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and \n4. HHS has not provided any justification for the termination of these services other than, \nallegedly, the “Government’s convenience.”  \n \n33. On March 21, 2025, shortly after receiving the notice of termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 \nunder the UCP contract, Florence Project leadership promptly notified all staff regarding \nthe terminations and provided additional specific instruction to staff who provided \nservices under the UCP clarifying how they would need to change aspects of their work \nto follow that order. That guidance explained to staff the different ways in which aspects \nof the critical legal services we provide children would be treated moving forward. For \nthose key legal services falling under CLIN 1 – initial KYRs and legal consultations – \nFlorence Project leadership explained to impacted staff that these services can and would \ncontinue without pause, explaining details like the fact that staff can and should use \nAcacia resources for third-language interpretation for such services. However, for those \nother critical and core aspects of our work with unaccompanied children – notably our \ndirect representation of said children, friend of court and docket presence, and data entry \n– the Florence Project leadership communicated that such work would no longer fall \nunder the UCP, staff may not refer to these programs as being through Acacia or the \nUCP, and staff cannot use Acacia interpretation resources to support such cases. Per \ninstructions from Acacia regarding documenting “unavoidable work” on open cases \nunder the terminated CLINs for possible, but not guaranteed, reimbursement through a \npotential termination settlement, Florence Project leadership requested that Florence \nProject staff continue to carefully document time, mileage, and data for internal purposes \nfor any work done on represented cases or other parts of the terminated CLINs. \nAdditionally, because the Florence Project’s mission is to provide free legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children in Arizona, with a core value of ensuring that no \nchild ever stands alone in immigration court, we also immediately began to discuss how \nwe could potentially transition the critical representational, shelter advocacy,and friend of \ncourt services that had been conducted under terminated CLINs of the UCP to other legal \naccess mechanisms. As such, we also provided initial instruction to staff on how we \nenvision ensuring continuity of legal and social services for children appearing pro se \nbefore EOIR as well as those whom we were already representing under CLIN 2 without \ngovernment funding. However, Florence Project funding is such that, without a massive \nnew source of revenue to support such efforts, the Florence Project will only be able to \nsustain these efforts at our current level based on general funding for a short period of \ntime.  Finally, we notified staff in our children’s program targeted communication that, \ngiven the loss of UCP funding, we had to hold on responding to any new case referrals \n \n3 On March 25, 2025, Florence Project received word that the government was considering moving data \nreporting requirements from CLIN 1 to CLIN 2, a process that still must undergo bilateral negotiation on \npricing.   \nStay Motion Addendum 053\n\n(78 of 348), Page 78 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 78 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 19\nand refrain from entering into any new attorney/client relationships for unaccompanied \nchildren in Arizona.   \n \nOrganizational Harm Caused By Loss of UCP Contract Services \n \n34. As an initial matter, the termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 under the UCP contract will \ncause serious financial harm to the Florence Project. The UCP subcontract constitutes a \nmajor portion of the Florence Project’s overall annual budget, with an average value of \napproximately 12 million per option year on the full contract. The terminated CLINs \nrepresent – depending on the option year being considered – a lost value of over 8 to \nnearly 10 million dollars of funding that supports Florence Project’s core legal and social \nservices for unaccompanied children. Moreover, the termination of the majority of the \nUCP contract also means that the Florence Project will also have to pay out-of-pocket for \ninterpretation services for the child clients we currently directly represent – over 800 \nchildren with whom we entered into representation in good faith specifically under this \ncontract – for those who do not speak either Spanish or English. Given the vast number \nof clients we serve and the many languages they speak, this also represents a significant \nadditional expense. For example, in one month, Florence Project staff reported requiring \nat least 11,000 minutes of interpreter time. Without language support through the UCP \ncontract, this cost will be incurred by the Florence Project.  \n35. As noted above, over 100 staff members’ salaries are directly funded by the UCP \nsubcontract and the loss of more than 70% of the funding for the Children’s Program \nmeans that the Florence Project now faces needing to pay for those salaries using general \nfunding sources. The Florence Project’s ability to pay staff to continue our core work \nproviding legal and social services to unaccompanied children, work that is mandated by \nstatute and regulation, will become fiscally untenable in a matter of months unless the \nterminated CLINs are reinstated, or another massive influx of alternative funding can be \nidentified.   \n \n36. The termination of all but a small portion of the UCP funding reflects the Government’s \nintent to permanently shrink in size and end the provision of these critical legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children. This is cause for serious concern as to the Florence \nProject’s overall budget, staffing plans, staff morale, longstanding community and \nstakeholder relationships, and the ability to keep qualified and trained staff with the \norganization. At the outset, due to transitions, internal promotions, and staff departures, \nthe Florence Project’s UCP subcontract contemplates 20 additional positions that are \ncurrently open. However, as a direct result of this termination, the Florence Project is \nundergoing a hiring pause on all currently unfilled positions. This hiring pause extends \nbeyond only those positions that would have been funded under the UCP; rather it \ntouches hiring for all currently open positions across the organization, with very few \nexceptions, given that general funding will need to be tapped to cover the substantial lost \nfunding for salaries that would have been covered under the UCP. Thus, staff and \nprograms across the organization, not only within the Children’s Program, feel both the \nnegative financial and morale ripple effects of this loss of UCP funding.  \nStay Motion Addendum 054\n\n(79 of 348), Page 79 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 79 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 19\n \n37. Moreover, the uncertainty around the budget and the Florence Project’s long-term ability \nto pay our staff’s salaries with general funds or fundraising is creating a sense of \noverwhelm and stress among remaining staff, both on the directly impacted team as well \nas on other teams, which negatively affects morale and people’s sense of job security. \nWhile the Florence Project hopes to avoid immediate layoffs, unless the terminated \nCLINs are reinstated or some miracle fundraising occurs, it is extremely likely that the \nall-but-total termination of funding under the UCP will necessitate substantial downsizing \nof the Children’s Program staffing. Indeed, Florence Project leadership has determined \nthat, based on this lost funding, layoffs will be necessary unless funding is reinstated, or \nwe receive miracle fundraising. As such, Florence Project leadership is beginning the \nmanagerial and administrative preparation for likely layoffs. Because the Florence \nProject is a unionized workplace, for most of our staff, the Florence Project must comply \nwith specific terms of our collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) regarding \ncommunication with the union about termination, notice prior to termination of \nemployment, and severance payments. This, in itself, results in the Florence Project \nincurring additional financial burdens in the form of legal expenses to plan for potential \nnecessary layoffs with our labor and employment counsel to ensure compliance with our \nCBA and applicable laws as well as the financial loss of severance pay to any employees \nwho may be subject to layoffs.  \n \n38. It is also critical to note that people are not like cogs in a machine where one can be \ninterchangeably and readily replaced by another; once layoffs are announced and/or \nbegin in earnest, the Florence Project will lose staff and, with them, their experience, \nexpertise, and work towards our mission. Even if funding were to be restarted, we would \nnot be able to simply replace lost staff with equally qualified and experienced people. We \nwould have to invest significantly in recruitment and training any new or replacement \nstaff, which poses additional costs to the organization. Moreover, in the uncertain world \nof non-profit services, an organization’s reputation as a relatively steady or secure place \nto work carries great weight in that organization’s ability to recruit and keep qualified \nstaff. Thus, if we must undergo significant lay-offs due to lack of funding, the harm to the \nFlorence Project’s reputation as being able to offer reasonably secure employment will be \nirreparably undermined, which will make it exceedingly difficult for us to hire to replace \npositions even if funding is eventually restored.   \n  \n39. Additionally, the termination of all portions of the UCP contract touching on \nrepresentation of clients substantially harms both the Florence Project and our clients \nbecause the termination notice, it seems, provided no guidance, support, or wind-down \nprocess for the cases in which our attorneys have already entered. Florence Project \nattorneys are currently entered on over 800 UCP cases in Arizona. As is the case with all \nof Florence Project’s services, our representation of these children is entirely free of \ncharge to the clients. As attorneys, we have ethical obligations to our clients, particularly \nthose with imminent court appearances or key case filings or other deadlines. We cannot \nethically simply stop representing our child clients – doing so would not only be morally \nwrong but also would subject the Florence Project to substantial legal liability and our \nattorneys to discipline from the bar. Beyond this fact, we must also take into account the \nStay Motion Addendum 055\n\n(80 of 348), Page 80 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 80 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 19\nparticular vulnerabilities of our clients – such as their young age, their lack of financial \nresources and in many cases their inability to work in order to raise funds for paid \ncounsel, language and education barriers, and the technical complexity of many of their \ncase – when determining whether terminating or otherwise limiting our representation \nwould be ethical or appropriate. As a result, minimally, the Florence Project will certainly \nincur significant expenses to continue representation to our clients who we are ethically \nobligated to continue representing despite the termination of these funds. And, given that \nour mission continues to be to provide free legal and social services with a vision of \nensuring that all unaccompanied children have access to counsel and are treated fairly \nand humanely, Florence Project continues to be dedicated to seeking means to continue \nrepresentation of all of our clients, current and prospective, as well. This means that our \ndevelopment efforts have been diverted from other critical initiatives to instead attempt to \nreplace as much as possible this lost funding and to try to reduce the impact of this \nmassive loss.    \n \n40. The complete termination of all CLINs touching on representation services, shelter \nadvocacy, friend of court services, and more will irreparably harm the people that the \nFlorence Project serves and severely hamper our ability to provide our core services. \nIndeed, just prior to the announcement of the termination of these programs, Florence \nProject staff noted DHS in Phoenix advancing cases of children in ORR custody, \nspeeding up the removal process. Similarly, in the Tucson EOIR, Florence Project staff \nrecently noted the appearance of children’s names on the court docket even where there is \nno evidence that Notices to Appear have even been filed yet with the courts in those cases \nand no notice of hearing listed on the EOIR Automated Case information system, raising \nserious questions both about accelerating the court process for children and doing so in \nways that may not comport with statutes, regulations, or due process. However, without \nfunding to provide representation or even appear as friend of court, it has become unclear \nhow Florence Project staff can best advocate regarding the legal propriety of placing \nchildren on a ‘rocket docket’ or scheduling children for court before charging documents \nhave even been filed. It is not realistic to expect children to navigate the complexities of \nimmigration court on their own in general, much less on an expedited timeline. \nAdditionally, our staff have recently experienced judges denying reasonable requests, \nsuch as administrative closure for children with claims for relief before USCIS. I \npersonally witnessed an Immigration Judge in Phoenix conduct group master calendar \nhearings rife with due process issues in which children were forced to answer the judge’s \nquestions related to notice, service, and, notably, best language out loud and all at once. \nPractices such as these all but guarantee that, without robust UCP services in place \ncontinuously, children’s cases will be expedited in a way that deny children the \nopportunity to reunify with sponsors and will result in children being ordered removed \nnot because of the merits of their case, but because of their age, developmental stage, lack \nof education or language abilities, and lack of knowledge or understanding of the legal \nrequirements. \n \n41. The due process cost of so many unaccompanied children potentially losing experienced \npro bono counsel across the state of Arizona, and indeed the nation, at the same time, is \nStay Motion Addendum 056\n\n(81 of 348), Page 81 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 81 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 17 of 19\nalso going to be unmeasurable. Florence Project staff currently represent many children \nwho will suffer immediate harm if we are unable to continue representing them pro bono.  \n \n42. For example, Florence Project attorneys currently represent a set of siblings who fled \ntheir country of origin after their mother died and their sister was murdered in front of \none of the siblings. All three have applications for asylum pending before USCIS and \nthey have been recently approved for SIJS with deferred action. Both are processes that \nwill require additional complicated legal work, including potential asylum interviews and \nadjustment of status applications among other things, which will require the assistance of \nan attorney. Additionally, given the rapidly changing landscape in immigration law, \npolicy, and enforcement, it is apparent that these children will likely require additional \nsupport for legal counsel while their process is pending. Indeed, just recently, despite \nhaving actively been participating in their immigration process – they had attended \nUSCIS  biometric appointments and receiving approved I-360 Petition for Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status with deferred action, and the immigration court case was \nalready concluded with non-opposition by DHS to allow them to move forward with the \nUSCIS process – despite all of this, armed immigration enforcement officers came to \ntheir home claiming they were “missing” and demanding to speak to them about their \ncases. While seasoned attorneys work diligently to keep abreast of changes in \nimmigration law, policy, and enforcement and have training in how to respond to a \nsituation like this, it is unreasonable to expect children like these siblings to do the same \non their own. Additionally, with three children all needing legal services, the cost to hire \nprivate counsel would be a significant financial burden their sponsor. As such, the \nelimination of funding to support children like these would seriously harm these clients \nand cut to the very core of the Florence Project’s mission and services.  \n \n43. In another example, Florence Project staff attorneys recently learned about two separate \ncases of children, both babies, under the age of two-years-old who are in one of the \nArizona tender-aged shelters who are currently not getting reunified with their parents \nand require additional advocacy for the government to follow protocols established under \nthe Ms. L. v. ICE settlement agreement – a settlement agreement arising out of the \nmassive violation of rights of children and parents that occurred under “zero tolerance” \nfamily separation policies from 2017 to 2018. Like most two-year-olds, both of these \nchildren are pre-verbal and unable to advocate for themselves about anything, much less \ncomplicated matters involving legal settlement agreements and reunification policies. \nHowever, given the current termination of representation under the UCP, there is no \nfunding to represent these children or even advocate for them in any way short of full \nrepresentation. As such, Florence Project managers are currently assessing to what extent \nwe will be able to help these extremely young children without any funding, knowing \nthat we must either absorb the cost of representation for these extremely vulnerable \nchildren by drawing down on general funding or reassigning funds from other programs \nor stand by and allow the rights of these children to be violated. \n \n44.  Elimination of funding for the UCP program also creates an untenable system whereby \naccess by legal advocates to children in detention will be left up to the government \nStay Motion Addendum 057\n\n(82 of 348), Page 82 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 82 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 19\noffices and workers, who are at times the very people abusing and trafficking children. \nWith this funding eliminated, children will have to pay for attorneys out of pocket, a \nconcept which boggles the mind, especially considering the dearth of experienced \nimmigration pro bono counsel in the United States. Moreover, there is already a serious \nshortfall of attorneys in Arizona who have the specialized experience needed to work on \ndetained children’s cases, which pose unique issues of law. The pool of attorneys willing \nto do the work is even smaller for children’s cases, as many children’s cases require \nadditional expertise in juvenile law in Arizona, which all FIRRP attorneys have, but \nwhich many private practioners do not. Indeed, while immigration court is a federal \nsystem which allows attorneys barred in any state to represent clients, only attorneys \nbarred in the state of Arizona may represent clients in state court proceedings; many \nprivate immigration attorneys who practice in Arizona (who may be barred outside of \nArizona and legally work on federal immigration cases) may not even be qualified to \nrepresent unaccompanied children who require these state court proceedings.  \n45.Without federal funding for UCP work, access to counsel also will be largely left up to\nthe ORR shelters. If this were to pass, it would create a clear conflict of interest, as ORR\nis often the perpetrator of abuse, mistreatment, or failure to follow legal protections for\nchildren. With the recent dismantling of the ORR Ombudsman office, and the Office of\nCivil Rights and Civil Liberties, children detained in ORR custody are placed in a system\nwith even less independent oversight and accountability than before, which makes access\nto free counsel more important than ever.\n46.Finally, elimination of access to the unaccompanied children who are detained in ORR\ncustody for representation, for the first time since we began working with unaccompanied\nchildren 25 years ago, is deeply disruptive to our core legal service model and will\ndirectly harm children who will be deprived free legal and social services, attorneys to\nrepresent them in court or assist as friend of court when they are waiting to reunify with\nfamily members. Unaccompanied children, particularly those who are placed in LTFC\nshelters, or who remain in ORR custody during their removal proceedings, or who are\nnear to turning 18 and require immediate urgent action on their cases to protect their\nrights, all groups children who the Florence Project now routinely represents as a matter\nof course, will have no means to pay any private attorney to represent them, leaving those\nwho are in many ways the most vulnerable most likely to be denied their basic rights. The\nloss of funding to support these services cut deeply at the Florence Project’s core mission\nand vision.  Children will no longer have caring advocates they can trust, who will get to\nknow their cases through expert and age-appropriate methods and advocate for their\nexpressed interests. Even the threat of loss of access and the resulting uncertainty it has\ncaused within our staff has had a profound impact on the morale of our staff who have\ndedicated their careers to serving unaccompanied children; now, facing the termination of\nall but the most basic KYR services to the thousands of children we serve is devastating\nto staff morale.\n47.Additionally, FIRRP’s vision that every person facing removal have access to counsel,\nunderstand their rights, and be treated fairly and humanely is also severely undermined\nby the elimination of the UCP. First, for the majority of children in ORR custody in\nStay Motion Addendum 058\n\n(83 of 348), Page 83 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 83 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 19\nArizona, Florence Project attorneys and staff working under the UCP are likely their only \naccess to counsel and opportunity to receive pro bono representation. Eliminating access \nto representation and friend of court services under the UCP will ensure that children are \nforced into removal proceedings – proceedings we have already seen are being \naccelerated and conducted in part using mass hearings that violate due process – without \ncounsel. Termination of all but CLIN 1 of the UCP will effectively guarantee that more \nchildren in ORR custody in Arizona will go through their removal proceedings without \nan attorney to represent them or even help them navigate the system during their court \nprocess. No child should be expected to be able to learn immigration law and present a \ncomplex legal case against a trained government attorney, often in a language they do not \nunderstand, on their own.       \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \nExecuted this 26th day of March, 2025 in Phoenix, Arizona. \n_____________________ \nRoxana Avila-Cimpeanu \nDeputy Director\nFlorence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project\nStay Motion Addendum 059\n\n(84 of 348), Page 84 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 84 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION DANIELA \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nHERNÁNDEZ CHONG CUY IN \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1. My name is Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy and I am the founder, owner and Directing\nattorney of the Law Office of Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy, a Professional Corporation.\n(“Law Office of D. H. CH. C.”).  Based in Pasadena, California, the Law Office of D. H.\nCH. C. provides comprehensive legal representation to unaccompanied immigrant children\nformerly in the custody the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) in Los Angeles, San\nBernadino, Ventura, and Riverside counties.  We are also the sole legal service provider\nfor two ORR long-term foster care facilities: Building Bridges Foster Family Agency in\nOntario, CA, and MarSell Wellness in Montebello, CA.\n3. In order to carry out this mission, the Law Office of D. H. CH. C. has several main work\ncomponents: (1) Representing children in long-term foster care under ORR custody in\nimmigration proceedings; (2) Representing unaccompanied minors who are not in ORR\ncustody in immigration proceedings;  and (3) Providing educational services in the form of\nlegal education “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations for unaccompanied minors\nunder the Post-release Initial Legal Service (“PILS”) program.\n4. The Law Office of D. H. CH. C. has been providing legal services for unaccompanied\nimmigrant children in California since May 2023. In May 2023, as subcontractors of the\nUnaccompanied Children’s Program, we began providing legal representation for children\ndetained in an LTFC in Ontario, California, and for unaccompanied minors who were no\nlonger in ORR custody in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Riverside counties.\nIn 2024, our services under the contract expanded to include a second LTFC facility in\nMontebello, California, and to cover a larger number of released unaccompanied children.\n1 \nStay Motion Addendum 061\n\n(86 of 348), Page 86 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 86 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\n5.  Since 2023, our office has initiated a combined total of 75 cases. In 2024, we initiated \nrepresentation for 15 children in long-term foster care and 27 children that have been \nreleased from previous ORR custody—a total of 42 children just that year. Just in the first \nfew months of 2025 alone, we have initiated representation of eight unaccompanied minors \nin long-term foster care, which is likely explained due to the uptick of children in need of \nlong-term care.  \n6.  Currently our office has 60 open cases under the ORR contract. To fulfill our duties as a \nprovider of legal services for unaccompanied minors, I have had to restructure my business \nmodel and the clientele my Law Office serves, limiting the number of private clients I can \ntake at any given time to accommodate the growing demand of competent legal service \nproviders for this vulnerable population.    \n7.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, the Law Office of \nD. H. CH. C. has maintained four staff members dedicated to providing legal services to \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  Specifically, our team is composed of two full-time \nattorneys, including myself, and two full-time paralegals. Our fourth and most recent hire \nwas welcomed to our team in October 2024.  \n8.  Staff providing representation and KYR presentations to children in long-term foster care \nregularly travel to meet each child in person to conduct client interviews and prepare clients \nfor Immigration Court hearings. Our staff visits the facilities at least once a month, with \nin-person visits often occurring on a bi-weekly basis. The LTFC clients can also request a \nvirtual meeting with their attorney for faster and more convenient scheduling; we take these \nsorts of meetings at least twice a week. In-person visits can range from one to four hours, \ndepending on the legal work to be done and the youth served on each visit. Child \nrepresentation requires a trauma-informed approach, so the work cannot be rushed. The \nclients will set the tone and pace for our work and conversations.   \n9.  In addition to providing representation in removal proceedings before the Immigration \nCourt,  we  provide  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  before  United  States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) and California Family, Probate, and \nDependency court as needed.  A majority of the children we represent are eligible for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), a critical form of immigration relief for \nchildren  who  have  suffered  abuse,  abandonment,  or  neglect.  SIJS  proceedings  are \nespecially pertinent to children in long-term foster care, who require dependency courts to \ndesignate an institutional caregiver to ensure their well-being.  Many children we serve are \nalso eligible for asylum, as they fear persecution in their countries of origin.  Our office \nprovides services not only to initiate their asylum applications, but to accompany them to \ntheir critical asylum interview before USCIS.  Other children we serve are eligible for U \nNonimmigrant Visas, as they have been victims of criminal activity in the United States, \n2 \n \n\n(87 of 348), Page 87 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 87 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\nthus we provide representation before the necessary law enforcement agencies to prepare \ntheir case.    \n10. A large part of our ORR contract focuses on serving unaccompanied children in long-term \nfoster care.  Unaccompanied immigrant children are placed in long-term foster care when \nthey have no one in the United States who is available to care for them.  These children \nrequire a particular form of representation, due to the increased vulnerability of not having \nan adult to be released to in the United States.  Due to their circumstances, children in long-\nterm foster care do not have the financial resources to pay for an immigration attorney.  \nFurther, many of these children experienced severe abuse, neglect, or persecution in their \ncountries of origin, and require trauma-informed advocates to help them navigate the \ncomplex world of immigration law. We have clients as young as two years old, who would \nbe unable to represent themselves before any court or government agency or to find a paid \nattorney. We represented  a client belonging to the Hazara/Suni ethnic and religious \nminority who fled Afghanistan after the takeover by the Taliban regime in 2021; we helped \nhim prepare and present his asylum application before the Los Angeles Asylum Office, \nand file other applications for relief before USCIS, all complex procedures he would be \nunable to navigate on his own, due to age, and cultural and language barriers. We have an \nindigenous Raramuri client, a 16-year-old girl who has no known direct relatives either in \nMexico or in the United States; we provided representation for the appointment of an \ninstitutional guardian in state court and just received notices of approval of her SIJS \napplication. We advocated before multiple stakeholders so that a family of four young \nchildren from Angola be released from ORR custody to reunify with their family in \nCanada.  None of these clients would have been able to seek relief without our assistance.    \n11. Our work is critical not only in preserving our clients’ access to justice, but in ensuring that \nthe Immigration Court’s juvenile docket runs efficiently. The consistency in the way we \nhave provided legal representation for our detained clients and prepared applications for \nrelief during the past two years has led to an efficient management of the juvenile docket \nat the Immigration Court in Santa Ana, California, where our cases are routinely terminated \nor administratively closed.  This avoids unnecessary delays, alleviates the Court’s and \nICE’s case load, and directs resources where they may be best and most efficiently used. \nOur advocacy for our clients ensures that the due process rights of children in immigration \nproceedings are respected without need of the Immigration Court mandating unnecessary \ncontinuances of their proceedings, or without requiring that the Immigration Judge take \nadditional time to explain to the children before them their rights in those proceedings and \nhow they could in theory advocate for themselves.  In every court appearance, Immigration \nJudges have expressed their gratitude for our work.   \n12. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  five  Contract  Line  Numbers  (CLINs). \n3 \n \n\n(88 of 348), Page 88 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 88 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 8\nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025 \n13. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers (CLINs):  \nCLIN  2,  Legal  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  as  well  as  other  non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children.  \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities, and CLIN 5, which \nfunds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent children not covered under other \nCLINs. Per the partial termination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n14. On March 21, 2025, I was notified via email communication by the Acacia Center for \nJustice that a stop work order had been issued for all the legal work we do under the \nunaccompanied children’s program. Immediately, I communicated this message to my \nteam, ordering them to cancel any activity that was not strictly necessary to fulfill our \nethical duties and giving them the rest of the guidelines necessary to comply with the order.  \n15. When I learned about the stop work order and termination of the contract, my office staff \nwas in State Court attending to guardianship hearings for LTFC clients, and in the LTFC \nprogram we serve. As soon as I was able to speak with them, I informed my staff to cease \nall work under the contract. Our office is scheduled to appear in Court on Friday, March \n28, 2025, on two separate cases, and to prepare for asylum interviews with the Asylum \nOffice and respond to USCIS notices before April 1, 2025. Until I am able to determine \nhow to proceed on each one of the cases without being in violation of the rules of \nprofessional conduct, I plan to appear in Court for our scheduled cases, and to attend all \nlegal and court mandated deadlines, so long as it is financially feasible.   \n16. Earlier today, the Lead Case Manager for one of the LTFCs my office serves, requested \nthat I make arrangements to speak with our clients tomorrow, March 27, 2025, to inform \nthem of the termination of the contract, per the request of their Regional Director. At this \npoint, I continue to navigate the ethical implications of the termination of the contract and \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 064\n\n(89 of 348), Page 89 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 89 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\nthe impact this will have on representation of my detained and non-detained clients. I \nrespectfully declined the program’s request and informed them that termination of the \ncontract does not automatically terminate legal representation, and that I will schedule to \nspeak with the minors as soon as I am able to provide them with clear responses of the full \nextent of the implications of the termination of the contract.  \n17. Currently, the funds we receive for our unaccompanied children’s work accounts for 70-\n75% of our overall budget.  Similarly, most of the work we perform on our daily operation \nrelates to these contracts. As a small firm, our entire staff is affected by a loss of \nunaccompanied children’s funding. Before we entered into this contract with ORR, my \nLaw Office was not dependent on this funding, but its demands have required me to \nrestructure my Law Office’s clientele and expand my staff.  From May 2023 to September \n2024, we managed to operate with two attorneys and one paralegal; we welcomed the \nfourth member of our team in October 2024.  Because my office is a private practice, the \npartial termination of this program will have a severe financial impact on the operation of \nmy Law Office.  Within two months I will not be able to cover the financial obligations \ntowards my staff or cover the cost of our daily operations.  As a private practice, we are \nestablished as an “S” corporation, and do not have the tax structure or lobbying capacity \nnecessary to secure the external funding required to solvently continue providing these \ntypes of legal services without the payment previously contracted.  \n18. For the duration of the original stop work order which occurred on February 18, 2025, we \nwere fortunate enough to continue providing the strictly necessary legal services to our \nexisting clients and fulfill our ethical duties with minimum repercussions.  Still, we were \nforced to reschedule appointments with clients and provide services like attending court \nhearings without knowing if we were going to be compensated for the work done, while \navoiding unnecessary stress or burden for our clients.  \n19. The effects of the current termination on our office are immediate.  The impact on our \nmorale is severe, as it forces us to restrict communications and services presented to our \nclients to the bare minimum, which is contrary to our client-centered approach.  Moreover, \nit will not be possible to provide a living wage to my staff and quality legal services to my \nclients as a Law Office without unaccompanied children’s funds. A shutdown of the \nunaccompanied children’s program income leaves us in the precarious situation of having \nde facto 60 new unfunded clients, from our total of approximately 150 clients, to whom we \nhave a duty to continue to provide service, at least for the foreseeable future.  Under the \nCalifornia Rules of Professional Conduct, attorneys in general may withdraw from their \nrepresentation if they are paid for services if the client breaches the agreement and the \nattorney  gives  them  reasonable  time  to  secure  new  representation,  amongst  other \nconditions.  However, the representation contract we entered with the children from the \nunaccompanied children’s program is pro bono. That is, our attorneys cannot unilaterally \nterminate their client’s legal representation solely for lack of payment or professional \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 065\n\n(90 of 348), Page 90 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 90 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\nfunding, particularly because it would be highly prejudicial for them as unaccompanied \nchildren while they are detained or underage.  Under Rule 1.16(d), a lawyer shall not \nterminate  representation  until  they  have  taken  reasonable  steps  to  avoid  reasonably \nforeseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, such as giving the client sufficient notice \nto permit the client to retain other counsel or obtain a copy of their legal file. It is very \ndifficult to see a scenario under which our young clients under long-term foster care, ages \n2-17, would be able to retain legal counsel on their own or to be able to present competent \nrepresentation that would make our withdrawal permissive under California Rules.  \n20. Continuing to operate with at least 60 unfunded clients for the foreseeable future will  likely \nbankrupt my small business.  It will force me to incur significant debt to try to once again \nredistribute the ratio of my client portfolio to serve additional private clients. With my \nreduced staff, and considering that we already serve over 150 clients, it would be nearly \nimpossible to manage a clientele restructuring while maintaining a full staff and sound \nfinances.   \n21. In addition, on January 8, 2025, my house was completely destroyed in the Eaton fire, in \nAltadena, California.  This forced my family of three, including my two-year old, to be \ndisplaced.  It was not until March 1, 2025, that we were able to secure temporary housing. \nThe disaster my family experienced disrupted my business operations. While my office \ncontinued working, and the rest of my staff was spared from the fire, I had to take \nextraordinary measures to be able to respond to the stop work order and the financial \nimplications that followed.  \n22. When I started the Law Office of D. H. CH. C. in 2020, I wanted to create a private law \npractice that could provide both a balanced environment for my staff and provide services \nso that clients of all backgrounds and resources could find competent and caring legal \nservices.  To this day, we aim to provide zealous, competent and holistic representation to \nour clients in the immigration system, whether detained or non-detained, and at all stages \nof their immigration removal proceedings. Our mission is still to provide client-centered \nand trauma-informed legal representation. I hope that we can carry on with this vision \nwithout it leading to financial ruin.     \n   \n   \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 066\n\n(91 of 348), Page 91 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 91 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 8\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 26 of March 2025, in Pasadena, CA.         \n       \n   ______________________________  \nDaniela Hernandez Chong Cuy \nDirecting Attorney/Owner  \nLaw Office of Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy \nUCP Legal Service Provider \n \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 067\n\n(92 of 348), Page 92 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 92 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 12\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ANA RAQUEL \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nDEVEREAUX (MIRC) IN SUPPORT \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and correct \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Ana Raquel Devereaux, and I am a Senior Managing Attorney at the \nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center (hereinafter, “MIRC”). MIRC is a non-profit \norganization that provides free legal services for children and other non-citizens who \nhave suffered abuse, trafficking, and persecution. MIRC is the only organization serving \nunaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(hereinafter, “ORR”) in Michigan and the primary organization providing legal services \nto children in the unaccompanied refugee minor program in Michigan and to children \nreleased from ORR custody to sponsors in Michigan.  \n2.  Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) is a legal resource center for Michigan's \nimmigrant communities. MIRC works to build a thriving Michigan where immigrant \ncommunities experience equity and belonging. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is \na program of   . MIRC has five local \noffices  throughout  the  state  of  Michigan  which  provide  direct  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied children and also provide general community immigration legal services. \nOur five local offices are located in  Detroit, Ypsilanti, Lansing, Grand Rapids, and \nKalamazoo. These five offices are supported by a statewide structure within MIRC to \nprovide training, administrative and supervisory support, community engagement, and \npro bono support.  \n3.  In  order  to  carry  out  this  mission  with  respect  to  providing  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied  children,  MIRC  has  several  main  work  components:  (1)  Providing \neducational  and  pro  se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” \n(“KYR”) presentations, conducting individual consultations (intakes), and conducting pro \nse  workshops  with  all  unrepresented  children  in  ORR  custody  in  Michigan;  (2) \nRepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration \nproceedings; and (3) Representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. \nWe  further  host  Immigrant  Justice Corps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied \nchildren  in  removal  proceedings  and  provide  Spanish-language  support  for  staff \nrepresenting unaccompanied children. \n4.  MIRC  has  been  providing  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  immigrant children in \nMichigan since 2009 at a smaller scale and with a dedicated unaccompanied children’s \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 069\n\n(94 of 348), Page 94 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 94 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 12\nteam beginning in 2017 when MIRC received its first subcontract to serve children in \nORR custody in Michigan. That first contract focused on providing KYR presentations, \nlegal screening, support for hearings, and representation as needed for all children in \nshort-term ORR custody in Michigan and providing universal immigration representation \nto all children in long-term ORR custody in Michigan.  \n5.  Since 2017, the ORR bed capacity in Michigan for short and long-term shelters and foster \ncare facilities has expanded significantly to its current capacity of 335 short-term beds \nand 122 long-term beds. In 2021, MIRC’s subcontract expanded to permit MIRC to offer \nrepresentation to children in Michigan who have been released from ORR custody and \nare in removal proceedings. MIRC has grown its capacity to represent released children \nfrom  240  to  565.  Additionally,  in  2021,  an  Emergency Intake Site was opened in \nMichigan with 225 beds. MIRC served all of the children in that facility by providing \nKYR  presentations,  conducting  intakes,  and  conducting  pro  se  workshops  with  all \nunrepresented  children  in  ORR  custody  in  Michigan,  and  offering  representation, \nespecially when the facility turned over its population and housed most of the Afghan \nUnaccompanied Minors who arrived in ORR custody and the contract provided for and \nrequired asylum and work authorization for these youth while in ORR custody. MIRC \ncontinues to serve all ORR beds in Michigan and remains ready to expand to serve any \nadditional facilities that serve unaccompanied children in the state and to reach as many \nreleased children for representation as is within our capacity, which we have continually \nexpanded to address the unmet need in the state of Michigan. At this time, we serve the \nfollowing  facilities:  BCC  Caminos  Nacional  –  Michigan  Children’s  Home  Society, \nBethany Christian Services – Wedgwood Christian Services, Bethany TLC, Bethany \nUSCCB (Bellaview and Casa del Sol), LIRS – BCS MI Kalamazoo LTFC – Casa de \nEsperanza, LIRS  – BCS MI Kalamazoo LTFC TGH – Hacienda De Luz, Samaritas \nLTFC, LIRS–BCS MI Alma Shelter, LIRS–BCS MI East Lansing TFC, LIRS–BCS MI \nGrand Rapids Shelter – TAC, LIRS–BCS MI Grand Rapids TFC, LIRS–BCS MI Holland \nTFC, LIRS–BCS MI Muskegon TFC, USCCB Catholic Charities West Michigan TFC, \nSamaritas Shelter – Grand Rapids,  Samaritas URM – LIRS – Lansing, MI ,  Bethany \nChristian Services URM – USCCB – Kalamazoo, MI ,  Bethany Christian Services URM \n–  USCCB/LIRS  –  Grand Rapids, MI , Bethany Christian Services URM – LIRS – \nTraverse City, MI.    \n6.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, MIRC currently \nhas 147 positions serving children in and released from ORR custody in Michigan.  \nSpecifically, these 147 positions encompass 113 full-time employee’s worth of funding \nand dedicated services to unaccompanied children. Of these roles 58 are attorney staff \nroles (including attorney managers), 3 of which are Immigration Justice Corps Attorney \nFellows,  47  are  paralegals (all of whom are either DOJ-Accredited or are working \ntowards their DOJ-Accreditation), 13 are paralegal supervisors, and the remaining staff \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 070\n\n(95 of 348), Page 95 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 95 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 12\nfocus  on  data  reporting,  administrative  case  support,  case  intake,  training,  and \ncommunication. \n7.  Staff  providing  representation  and  KYR  presentations to children in ORR facilities \nregularly travel to each facility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for \nhearings,  as  well  as  provide  legal  education,  individual  consultations,  and  pro  se \nworkshops for pro se children.  MIRC serves children in 9 short-term facilities, which \nrange in size from 12 beds to 36 beds. Each week, MIRC staff visit the facility one to two \ndays to provide KYRs and intakes with each child who has arrived within the last week \nand also to provide follow-up services to children who have been at the facility for an \nextended time or are otherwise in need of representational legal services. Additionally, \nthe children come to our offices one additional day during the week as that additional \ntime is usually required to complete all the services within the contractually required 7-10 \nbusiness day period after their arrival in custody.   Additionally, we have 8 long-term \nORR facilities in Michigan, ranging in bed size from 8 to 32. When children arrive to \nlong-term ORR facilities, MIRC assigns an attorney/paralegal team to meet with the child \nand offer representation within 30 days of their arrival.  \n8.  For  children  released  from  custody,  the  children  are  either  referred  through  the \nAcacia-facilitated  referral  system,  UCORD,  or  by  calling  our  intake line,  once we \ndetermine  that the child meets the eligibility criteria while offices are accepting new \ncases, we then meet with the child within 30 days to offer representation. For children \nwith whom we have entered representational agreements, MIRC’s legal teams represent \nchildren in state and immigration court, file petitions with USCIS, file motions and \npetitions with the immigration court, file mandamus and habeas actions in the Eastern \nand Western Federal District Courts in Michigan, file appeals with the Michigan Court of \nAppeals, USCIS,  EOIR, the BIA (and in similar cases, we have proceeded as far at \npursuing appeals in 6th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, but it has not been necessary yet \nfor a case under this contract), as well as pursue other advocacy efforts within ORR and \nother spaces where unaccompanied children are detained and/or receive services.   \n9.  Children in short-term ORR custody have just arrived in this country and generally have \nnever been in a formal custodial system. They speak many different languages and have a \nvariety of educational backgrounds, ranging from no formal education to middle school \nlevel schooling, including high school-age children because they have rarely had high \nschool educational opportunities. Due to all of these factors, they are not yet equipped \nwith the resources to fully understand what rights they have while in custody and it is \nessential for them to meet with legal services providers to understand that they have a \nright to bodily safety, contact with family, medical care, and educational services, among \nother rights guaranteed in the Flores Settlement and the Foundational Rule. Additionally, \nthe  immigration  legal  system  is  extremely  complex  and  nuanced,  and  without  an \norientation with a legal service provider, it would be near impossible for children, let \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 071\n\n(96 of 348), Page 96 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 96 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 12\nalone the non-attorney staff at these short-term custodial sites to be able to explain, to \nunderstand critical pieces of the system that affect them, including the importance of \nkeeping addresses up to date and attending immigration hearings (and even how to \nunderstand the notices that arrive indicating when a hearing will occur).  \n10. A reality that must be addressed is that children in custody are incredibly vulnerable by \nthe nature of a custodial system where the vulnerability factors for sexual and physical \nabuse  are  extremely  prevalent.  A  bad  actor  may  take advantage of these systemic \nvulnerabilities. If these children do not have access to legal counsel that is independent \nfrom ORR and the organizations that sub-contract to provide the custodial services, these \nchildren surely will face even greater levels of abuse in custody. MIRC intervened and \nrepresented children in 2023 when there was an instance of systemic sexual abuse of \nchildren in short-term custody in one of the ORR Michigan facilities. MIRC worked to \nrepresent  individual  children,  supporting  them  in reporting to law enforcement and \nparticipating  in  the  prosecution  of  the  crime,  and  holding  agency  staff  and  ORR \nleadership accountable for ensuring further protections are put in place for future children \nin custody at that facility. Additionally, MIRC represented individual children who faced \nabuse in ORR foster homes and as soon as the child disclosed the circumstances to \nMIRC,  we  ensured  they  received  protection  and  there  was  accountability  for  the \nindividual and systemic failures that harmed the child.   \n11. In Michigan, if MIRC did not provide these services under the HHS contract, it would be \nimpossible for the majority of the children to receive representation. The private bar in \nMichigan is relatively small and generally at capacity. Very few private immigration \npractitioners take children’s cases, due to the specialty area of law it encompasses. The \nfew attorneys who do take the cases will charge $10,000 on average, which is outside of \nreach for most children released to the community and impossible for all children in ORR \ncustody who by definition have no family or financial support in the country. Before \nMIRC began working under the contract, we would receive frequent calls from staff at \nthe ORR facilities asking us to take the cases because no one else would do so, but \nwithout offering any funding for the work. We turned down a large number of these cases \ndue to a lack of capacity. \n12. Since MIRC’s founding in 2009, MIRC has engaged in recruitment and mentorship of \npro bono attorneys to the fullest extent possible, but a significant challenge has been that \nin the state of Michigan, pro bono attorneys do not generally have immigration expertise, \nonly speak English (and unwilling to pay for interpretation for pro bono cases), and are \nunwilling to commit to the timeframe of children’s immigration cases or with the special \ncare needed when working with children. Only recently have we had some small success \ninvolving pro bono attorneys in our children’s work, and it has been because the HHS \ncontract funds language support for the pro bono attorneys and we have a dedicated team \nto train and support those pro bono attorneys. Even with this support, the pro bono \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 072\n\n(97 of 348), Page 97 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 97 of 348\nattorneys will usually only offer support in small ways and rarely or never take on full \ncases for representation. \n13. A few other small non-profit legal service providers exist in the state of Michigan, but all \nof them are quite small and have only had capacity to focus on primarily adult and \nUSCIS-only representation, leaving no other non-profit options for children in removal \nproceedings aside from MIRC. \n14. In  addition  to  MIRC  providing  the  only  available  and  financially  accessible  legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied immigrant children in the state of Michigan, MIRC \ndedicates significant resources to ensuring the staff MIRC hires are culturally humble, are \npassionate  about  serving  immigrant  children,  are  trained  in  best  practices  for \ntrauma-informed and child-friendly legal services, follow strict child abuse prevention \nguidelines,  and  as  much  as  possible  share  cultural,  linguistic,  and  experiential \nbackgrounds with our child clients.  \n15. Under the unaccompanied child legal services program, since 2017, MIRC has entered \nrepresentation for 1,697 children, provided 5,686 Know Your Rights sessions, 4,061 legal \nscreenings, and identified 6,158 potential pathways for relief for our young clients. We \nhave represented children as young as 10 months old. In 2024, MIRC offered legal \nservices and representation to children who spoke 62 different languages MIRC has filed \nasylum for 725 children, with an 83% approval rate, and filed 351 applications for \npermanent residency, with 155 of those already approved (the remaining are pending). \nMIRC currently has over 900 cases open for unaccompanied children in removal \nproceedings. These numbers result in real, meaningful changes in the lives of children \nand families, children who grow up to thrive and be part of our communities. \n16. MIRC has represented children fleeing abuse, including those who were regularly \nwhipped with electric cords or who faced ongoing sexual abuse with no hope of \nprotection from their communities. MIRC has reunited children with loved ones–children \nshould have the opportunity to be children and the law requires them to be placed in the \nleast restrictive environment feasible, the best place for a traumatized child is with the \nfamily or community members with whom they feel most comfortable. These were \ncourses of action that required a lawyer due to their complexity, the legal expertise \nrequired, the many logistical barriers within USCIS and immigration court. Without  \nlegal representation, these children would have been forced to return to situations of \nabuse, persecution, and lack of safety due to the inability for a child to meaningfully \npresent their case. \n17. We have also represented children who have been trafficked, such as children who were \nforced to do dangerous work and beaten when they were too sick to go to work. One of \nthe most powerful tools that traffickers use is the threat of deportation to intimidate their \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 073\n\n(98 of 348), Page 98 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 98 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 12\ntargets. Taking lawyers away from children strengthens traffickers’ hands. Many times \nour legal services have prevented children from falling through the cracks–sometimes by \nidentifying abuse in custody and supporting children in coming forward to authorities \nabout such abuse and sometimes by helping children who find themselves in an unsafe \nsituation obtain safe housing or meet other needs to escape violence. \n18. In  addition  to  the  work  we do for children in and released from ORR custody in \nMichigan, we also work to connect children with counsel when they are moved to an \nORR placement outside of Michigan or are released out of state. We work with the child \nand use the information we obtained during intake consultation to prepare a referral and \nhave staff dedicated to following up to do our best to connect children to free legal \ncounsel in their new location.  \n19. MIRC is well respected among the local state courts, immigration courts, ICE, USCIS, \nand  local  ORR  subcontractor  staff.  MIRC  developed  norms  with  each \nORR-subcontracted facility by having quarterly meetings to work through logistics and \ncontinue to uphold best practices on behalf of the children in custody. Staff from these \nagencies regularly express their gratitude for MIRC staff and how essential they are for \nthe children. MIRC and the immigration court staff developed a weekly call framework \nwhere MIRC efficiently funnels the matters needing the court’s attention through one \ncentral point of contact, rather than having more than fifty representatives reaching out \nindividually  to  get  questions  answered  or  provide  information.  The court regularly \napproaches MIRC for support for pro se respondents and in support of MIRC remaining \non the court pro bono list (MIRC is the only organization on that list in Michigan). MIRC \nregularly  engages  with  ICE  and  USCIS  both  in  representational  settings  and  in \nstakeholder engagement contexts respectfully and collaboratively on behalf of the clients \nwhen possible. One of Detroit’s Immigration Judges recently took some time after a \nhearing to thank  our staff member for working for MIRC and for all the great and \nimportant work MIRC does.  \n20. Additionally,  MIRC  received  the  Champion  of  Change  award  in  2024  from  the \nGovernor’s Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and Children's Advocacy Centers of \nMichigan, as part of the nomination for the award, Veronica Thronson, leader of the \nMichigan State University College of Law’s Immigration Clinic, was quoted as praising \nMIRC as follows: \nThe nominee has been a champion for children since its inception, through direct \nrepresentation of children and their families in seeking protection in immigration \nand state contexts... These children have been abused, neglected, or abandoned in \nthe State of Michigan. MIRC's team has grown from two attorneys to its current \nsize of [, with] staff members focused specifically on protecting the rights of \nchildren  in  federal  custody  in  Michigan, achieving permanent protection for \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 074\n\n(99 of 348), Page 99 of 348  Case: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 99 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 12\nchildren through state and federal courts, and advancing the law to create the \ngreatest access to these protections for all children in Michigan. MIRC has stood \nin the gap during family separation under the Zero Tolerance policy and ensured \nthat all children in Michigan were reunited with their families according to their \nwishes. Further, MIRC has held the federal government and its subcontractors \naccountable when children’s rights were violated in federal care in Michigan, in \nlicensed and unlicensed facilities. The nominee has led efforts to try to ensure \nresponses to abuse in custody are trauma-informed and provide the protection \nneeded for children in care.   Illustrative of the difference that the nominee’s \nservices have made in the lives of children, in 2023 alone, the nominee served \nover  one  thousand  children  through  Know  Your  Rights  presentations,  legal \nscreenings,  and  direct  representation  in  immigration,  state  court,  and before \nimmigration agencies. Also in 2023, the nominee secured state court protections \nin  multiple  counties  and  began  a  path  toward  citizenship  for  hundreds  of \nimmigrant children. More stable immigration status allows children to thrive in all \nother aspects of their lives.  \nThe nominee recently added an innovative team to address social, emotional, and \nphysical needs, which has already assisted over 150 children. The nominee has \nincreased  knowledge  of  protections  for  immigrant  children  in  state  courts \nthroughout Michigan, creating a safety net for children across the state. These \nchildren who are released to sponsors or relatives frequently went without access \nto an attorney before the nominee’s programming emerged to serve them. MIRC \nhas been the leader in appellate cases that have enshrined protections available \nunder  the  law  to  immigrant  children  who  have  been  abused,  neglected,  or \nabandoned. In particular, the nominee has won two critical appeals that serve as \nseminal case law impacting immigrant children in Michigan.  \nThe nominee leads several collaborative efforts with stakeholders to enhance \noutcomes for children, through joint advocacy, training, and resource sharing. As \nnew populations of immigrant children enter the state, the nominee has taken a \nleading role in assisting service providers to be ready to welcome children in a \nculturally  informed  and  humble  manner.  Where  necessary,  the  nominee  has \nadvocated on behalf of children whose religious and cultural needs were not fully \nmet by other service providers and to ensure that children who are victims of \nsexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes are met with a holistic and \nculturally sensitive response. For example, the nominee has worked with law \nenforcement to inform them of the impact of trauma on specific populations, such \nas youth arriving from Afghanistan who had been evacuated during the Taliban’s \ntakeover and who had been separated from their families. \nThe nominee has also championed change through legislative advocacy at the \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 075\n\n(100 of 348), Page 100 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 100 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 12\nstate level to enhance protections for children who are harmed through child \nlabor, to expand access to Medicaid to children in need, and to ensure language \naccess  for  state  services. In particular, the nominee has partnered with state \nlegislators  to  increase  protections  for  children  exposed  to  exploitative  labor \npractices, partnering with various stakeholders and leaders to testify on the needs \nof children to local, state, and national media. \nOverall,  MIRC  has  changed  the  landscape  of  representation  for  immigrant \nchildren for the better in ways that are measurable in the law and the experience \nof children and their families in the community. Over the years, thousands of \nchildren have safety, stability, and the opportunity to thrive in no small part due to \nthe  team  focused  on  the  rights  and  representation  of  immigrant children in \nMichigan that the nominee has been able to cultivate and grow and seeks to keep \ndoing so to continue to serve children. \n21. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the \nInterior)  issued  a  national  contract  stop  work  order  for  Legal  Services  for \nUnaccompanied Children, effective immediately, which extended to all five Contract \nLine Numbers (CLINs): 1. KYR presentations and legal services for pro se children in \nORR facilities; 2. Legal representation for unaccompanied children not in ORR custody; \n3. Legal representation for unaccompanied children in ORR custody; 4. Spanish language \ntutoring for organizational staff who work with children; and 5. Immigrant Justice Corps \nfellows  who  represent  children  not  covered  under  other  CLINs.  Without  further \nelaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order states that it “shall remain in \nplace until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n22. Some MIRC staff were on a virtual meeting led by the Acacia Center for Justice on other \nmatters when the Acacia Center for Justice received notice of the stop work order around \n1:00  PM  EST.  Information  was  shared  on that call and an email was sent shortly \nthereafter to the entire network. We then immediately had to sort out what this meant in \npractice and how to ensure every staff member received the information and began to act \naccordingly. We had an urgent leadership meeting to understand the stop work order and \nattended an Acacia call hosted on the topic of the stop work order and then held a \nmeeting for our team to explain what we knew at that point, which was very little.  \n23. During the stop work order, MIRC used a small fund reserve to ensure our clients had the \nbest possible service for as long as possible. The stop-work order did not cut off legal \nrepresentation for children who are already represented. Because MIRC’s lawyers had \nalready filed paperwork with the court and USCIS as the attorney of record for our cases, \nthey are obligated to continue representation or face the possibility of sanctions or bar \ncomplaints — unless they ask a judge to be removed from the case, which takes time and \n8 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 076\n\n(101 of 348), Page 101 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 101 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 12\nhas very specific ethics rules that guide how to make this request and when and if a judge \nwill grant it. These reserves can only carry our staff for a few weeks. Roughly 80% of \nMIRC’s budget is funded through the unaccompanied children’s HHS funding. If we lose \nthis funding in the long term, we would expect to let go of all of 113 employees, in other \nwords, we do not expect meaningful replacement funding that would allow us to carry on \nthe work under this contract. We would also need to seek to withdraw from all of the \n1,205 open cases under the contract and would need to use reserves to have staff focus on \nthat work. The reserves are a critical part of MIRC’s long-term sustainability, so the Stop \nWork Order and any other loss of funding under this contract affects MIRC’s other work \nin the community for other vulnerable populations.  \n24. During the stop work order, we paused offering KYRs and intakes for children in ORR \ncustody and focused on using our limited resources to maintain our ethical obligations to \ncurrent child clients.  \n25. Time spent on stop-work order logistics cost us valuable time in needing to communicate, \nunderstand, and change our case management practices to account for the change under \nthe stop-work order. More than that, it has caused a significant feeling of instability, \nstress, and low morale. MIRC’s highly trained, experienced, and specialized staff are \nbeginning to put in their resignation notices to go to jobs that have more funding security. \nMIRC has built an outstanding reputation as an employer and has been able to attract \nunusually high quantities of staff to our work, compared to similar local non-profits, \nbecause of our commitment to the community, our stable funding, and our efforts to train \nand support our staff in their work. This reputation is being significantly undermined by \nthe stop work order and the subsequent lack of security around the ongoing funding of \nthe contract and it will make it harder to attract new staff in the future to replace those \nwho have left during this time.  \n26. When the stop work order was rescinded, MIRC resumed providing all services under the \nUCP contract. On March 21, 2025, MIRC received notice of ORR’s termination of \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4 of the Acacia UCP contract, effective at the close of business that day.  \n27. MIRC currently represents over one thousand children under the Acacia UCP contract \nCLINs 2 and 3 work. These cases involve representation before Michigan local state \ncourts, USCIS, and the Detroit Immigration Court. Without CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding, \nMIRC will begin an immediate process to withdraw from these cases. Even though we \nhave  made  significant  efforts  to  fundraise  with  individual,  foundation,  and  local \ngovernment funding, there is no meaningful replacement for the funding offered for \nrepresentational  services  of  unaccompanied  children  under  the  UCP  contract.  Our \nalternate fundraising may allow us to keep as many as 100-200 cases open, which would \nleave  over  800  children  whose  representation  we  will  need  to  withdraw  from \nimmediately. While we will begin our efforts to withdraw from the cases for which we \n9 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 077\n\n(102 of 348), Page 102 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 102 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 12\ndid not obtain alternate funding, the process of withdrawal takes some time with ensuring \nthe proper wrap-up tasks have been completed so the client is not unduly prejudiced by \nthe withdrawal and counsel needs to formally seek to withdraw where we have entered \nappearances before tribunals, which takes time and is subject to the decision of the judge \non each case.  \n28. While we have attempted to do the most we could for each client before we were in the \nposition, we still have many clients for whom no relief has been filed because we have \nonly  begun  working  on  their  cases  recently  or  there  were  external  hurdles  to \naccomplishing our initial goals in the case. Almost every one of the children MIRC \nrepresents qualifies for protection under the immigration law, however, it is a lengthy, \narduous, and legally complex process that allows us to usher the client to the point of \nreceiving the immigration status they qualify for. Many of the children whom we will no \nlonger be able to represent due to the termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 of the UCP \ncontract will be unable to secure new counsel and be unable to navigate the immigration \nprocesses without counsel, and so will be left without protections they qualified for and \nwill  be  deported  to  situations  where  they  would  face  abuse,  neglect,  persecution, \nseparation from critical caregivers and services. In all of this, expecting these children to \nface the immigration system without counsel will have deprived these children of their \nright to due process under the law.  \n29. CLINs  2,  3,  and  4,  comprise  about  75%  of  MIRC’s budget. Of the 113  full-time \nemployee’s worth of funding in our UCP budget, about 98 of those are in CLINs 2, 3, and \n4. If funding from CLINs 2, 3, and 4 is not restored within a few days, MIRC will need to \nproceed to provide layoff notices to the majority of staff funded under those CLINs. We \nare able to use some of the funds we raised to allow us to provide staff a short notice \nperiod to withdraw from cases and honor their rights as employees. Even this little bit of \nessential transition period after a layoff notice, will cost MIRC at least 1.2 million dollars \nof funds drawn from other sources that take away from MIRC’s ability to serve other \nvulnerable populations.  \n30. However, if the restoration of CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding is delayed any more than a week \nand we have already given staff their layoff notices, we expect most staff will still seek to \ndepart,  even  if  funding  is  restored,  because  of  the  uncertainty  and  individualized \ndetriment to their morale to know they specifically were not retained. Even as we have \nbeen nearing the end of the contract period, more and more staff have been departing, \nespecially  our  more  seasoned  staff,  because the earlier stop work order gave them \nconcern for the future of the funding. \n31. If the restoration of CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding is delayed any more than a month, and we \nwould be in a position to have to rehire for the work, it would be unlikely that most of the \nlaid-off staff would be interested in returning. Before this season of funding uncertainty, \n10 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 078\n\n(103 of 348), Page 103 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 103 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 12\nMIRC has been close to exhausting the hiring pool of those interested in and able to do \nwork under the UCP contract, especially where attorneys are concerned, and so I expect \nour success in bringing on new staff would be limited, to begin with, and it would cost us \nthe months of labor in recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and building their familiarity with \nthe work that it takes to return to the staffing norm we have now. \n32. Beyond the cost to the staff themselves, the cost to the clients of closing cases, laying off \nstaff, then having to bring on new staff, and trying to reach out to clients to try to offer \nthem representation again is devastating, specifically shattering those relationships of \ntrust which have taken so much to build. A stable and trusting relationship is critical for \nchildren. They will have no reason to trust our ability to continue to keep their cases and \nthey will have to build relationships with new people, assuming they are available, which \nis already hard for anyone having to share the most traumatic details of their life story in \norder to pursue immigration relief, but it is especially hard for a child in that situation.  \n33. The uninterrupted and ongoing funding of this work with unaccompanied children is \ncritical to the protection of children from harm in custody and against the significant risk \nposed by going through removal proceedings without counsel and the subsequent harm \nthat would result from removal. Not only that, but the stability of this funding is critical \nto MIRC’s ongoing work as an anchor immigrant rights organization. \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the District of Columbia that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 22 of March 2025, in Lansing, Michigan.           \n            \n_______________________________  \nAna Raquel Deveraux (P79145) \nSenior Managing Attorney \nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center \n11 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 079\n\n(104 of 348), Page 104 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 104 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF JILL MARTIN \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nDIAZ, ESQ.

My name is Jill Martin Diaz (they/them pronouns and Mx. honorific), and I am the \nExecutive Director  at Vermont Asylum Assistance  Project  (VAAP;  www.vaapvt.org). \nVAAP is a nonprofit immigration law firm dedicated to expanding access to critical legal \nservices for noncitizens across Vermont. VAAP grew from years of grassroots advocacy to \nmeet low-income Vermonters’ increasingly urgent needs for structured, equitable, and \ntrauma-informed  immigration  representation.  Today,  VAAP  is  Vermont’s  only  firm \ndedicated  to  providing  legal  services  to  indigent  unaccompanied  immigrant  children \nexiting detention, other youth and adult subpopulations in removal proceedings. \n2.  VAAP is a legal services organization committed to expanding access to immigration legal \nknowledge and direct services. We envision a Vermont where noncitizens fully understand \nand access their legal rights, and where immigrant and mixed-status families feel a true \nsense of belonging, regardless of legal status. Founded in 2021 by grassroots volunteers, \nVAAP incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) in late 2023. Now guided by an 11-\nmember board and staffed by a supervising attorney and three legal advocates, including \ntwo pending admission to practice, VAAP is mobilizing dozens of pro bono attorneys and \ntransforming Vermont’s immigration legal landscape through direct representation, pro \nbono coordination, technical assistance, and advocacy at the state and federal levels.  \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, VAAP has several main work components, including: (1) \nProviding educational and pro se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” \n(“KYR”) presentations, conducting individual consultations (intakes), and conducting pro \nse workshops with all unrepresented children exiting ORR custody into Vermont; and (2) \nRepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration \nproceedings.  We  further  host  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  (IJC)  fellows  to  represent \nunaccompanied children in removal proceedings and provide Spanish-language tutoring \nfor staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  VAAP has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in Vermont \nsince 2024. This marked a significant milestone for access to justice as VAAP doubled its \nstaff and brought Vermont its first-ever IJC Legal Fellows: Cameron Briggs Ramos and \nEmma Matters-Wood. Both are Unaccompanied Children Program (UCP) fellows who \nstarted in September 2024 and expanded VAAP’s intake criteria to not only include legal \nservices  for  immigrant  youth  and  over-18  UCs  but  also  to  guarantee  universal \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 081\n\n(106 of 348), Page 106 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 106 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\n \nrepresentation for all under-18 UCs exiting ORR custody into Vermont (noting Vermont \nlacks any ORR facilities in-state.).  \n5.  Since VAAP added two full time IJC UCP fellows to our staff in September 2024, we have \nbegun serving a combined annual number of around 135 immigrant children including: (a) \nabout 15 under-18 unaccompanied children leaving ORR custody and seeking full-scope \nrepresentation  on  asylum,  Special  Immigrant  Juvenile  Status  (SIJS),  or  related \nhumanitarian relief; (b) about 20 factually unaccompanied children who were not so-\ndesignated and/or were over-18 at intake and are also seeking full-scope representation; \nand (c) about 100 derivative beneficiary children included in their parents’ pro se asylum \napplications filed at VAAP-supervised pro bono legal clinics.  \n6.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, VAAP currently has \nhired two full time staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied \nimmigrant children. Specifically, VAAP employs IJC UCP Fellow Emma Matters-Wood \non a full-time basis directly serving clients statewide for a renewable one-year contract \nperiod from September 1, 2024, through August 31, 2025; and IJC UCP Fellow Cameron \nBriggs Ramos on a full-time basis directly serving clients statewide for a two-year contract \nperiod from September 1, 2024, through August 31, 2026. \n7.  VAAP staff providing representation and KYR presentations to children leaving ORR \nfacilities  to  a  Vermont  parent  or  caregiver  regularly  meet  clients  to  conduct  client \ninterviews, prepare clients for hearings, as well as provide legal education, individual \nconsultations, and pro se workshops for pro se children. The kinds of legal matters VAAP \nrepresents children in include removal proceedings in immigration court, affirmative relief \nlike asylum before USCIS, SIJS in state court, and advocacy in terms of equal access and \nenjoyment of state law-based rights and remedies. \n8.  As  Vermont’s  foremost  immigration  technical  assistance  provider  and  main  conduit \nbetween regional and national communities of practice and local communities, the unmet \nneed for KYR services/pro se workshops and/or legal representation is astonishing. These \nunmet needs are due to, for example, unaccompanied children not being able to afford \nrepresentation,  age  of  children,  trauma,  language  barriers,  geographic  isolation, \ntechnological and transportation barriers isolating rural parts of the state, lack of attorneys \ndue  to  remoteness  of  Vermont  towns,  and  scant  amount  of  nonprofit  and  private \nimmigration attorneys in the region.  \n9.  Vermont-based children trying to apply for various kinds of relief and/or advocate for \nthemselves without an attorney find it functionally impossible to access their removal \nproceedings in the Boston and Chelmsford Immigration Courts, as Vermont lacks public \ntransportation, services, and awareness and only represented parties can access virtual \nproceedings. Caregivers for unrepresented Vermont children as young as five years old \nhave contacted VAAP letting us know that without a cash grant for transportation and \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 082\n\n(107 of 348), Page 107 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 107 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\n \novernight accommodation and meaningful language access assistance, they would be \nunable to get the children to Immigration Court let alone to assist them to prepare and file \nthe children’s meritorious applications for legal relief. When VAAP has been able to offer \nrepresentation—universally to eligible UCs through the IJC UCP Fellows, and ad hoc to \nother immigrant children in Vermont—we have successfully stabilized children’s status by \nsecuring relief including SIJS; and promoted judicial economy by terminating proceedings \nfor children where court jurisdiction is improper. \n10. As a hybrid direct presentation/pro bono coordination service provider, VAAP provides \nfull-scope direct representation to about 35-40 children each year through our two IJC UCP \nFellow positions. VAAP  also  mobilizes  limited  assistance for  dozens  more who  are \nderivative beneficiaries of primary asylum seeker clinics accessing pro bono services on a \nlimited basis in VAAP-coordinated attorney-for-the-day clinics.  \n11. Numerous judges, clerks, and staff of local state and immigration courts, as well as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s field office staff, have commended VAAP staff for \npromoting more streamlined, fair, and efficient through their legal work. For example, on \nseveral occasions Chelmsford and Boston Immigration Courts have thanked us for helping \nto prevent unnecessary status conferences, at least, and at best for giving previously \nunrepresented parties the precious chance to fully developing their clearly meritorious \nclaims for relief. Representing Vermont children also prevents the courts from interfacing \nwith confused respondents about their travels and allows Vermont respondents to appear \nefficiently via Webex video conferencing. \n12. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025.  \n \n13. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective on the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 083\n\n(108 of 348), Page 108 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 108 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 8\n \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n14. Through social media/word-of-mouth, VAAP staff Emma and Cameron were the first to \nbecome  aware  of  the  February  21  and  March  21  orders  threatening  their  funding, \nexacerbating the adverse impacts them and their clients. On February 21, the information \nVAAP staff received was incomplete and changing, and as their supervisor I was not \nequipped to either confirm or deny rumors until IJC provided written guidance a few hours \nlater, which they supplemented in the days that followed with a town halls for IJC hosts \nand a one-on-one meeting with me. On March 21, VAAP staff were first to learn about the \nnew order, doing so from their peer fellows hosted by other organizations. Again, I \nconfirmed shortly thereafter with IJC, this time in person since the order was issued while \nIJC was gathered in New York City for its inaugural alumni convening. \n15. This funding loss is devastating to VAAP’s financial picture. Currently, the number of \nimmigrant children VAAP currently represents under the CLIN2 subcontract is about 15 \nand growing, as our contract is new and VAAP was in the process of conducting outreach \nwith referring partners statewide to connect incoming children with us as counsel—an \nonerous piece of work considering Vermont lacks any in-state ORR detention. For context, \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement-originated funding, including but not limited to our CLIN2 \nsubcontract, accounts for about half of VAAP’s overall operating budget and accounts for \nabout 75% of the funding VAAP needs to host our two IJC UCP fellows. As a newer \norganization with limited cashflow and mostly reimbursement-based funding sources, \nVAAP cannot administer payroll without UCP contract funding, and may need to furlough \nits two IJC UCP fellows. Indeed, when the Stop-Work Order was first announced in \nFebruary, VAAP temporarily furloughed our two IJC UCP fellows effective immediately \ncausing financial harm to the fellow and to VAAP and legal harm to VAAP clients including \nchildren in proceedings. When IJC UCP Fellows are furloughed, I am rendered the sole \nremaining direct legal service practitioner on staff and must absorb two full-time caseloads \nin addition to my existing full-time administrative, fiscal, and professional duties. Only \nwith IJC’s commitment of an expedited reimbursement for expenses incurred last quarter \nplus an additional 30 days of prepaid funding for the month of March was VAAP able to \nrestore Emma and Cam to full-time after a 48-hour furlough. \n16. Notably, the February Stop-Work order conspicuously co-occurred with the  J.O.P. v. \nDepartment of Homeland Security class settlement deadline of February 24, 2025, the date \nwhen  unaccompanied  children  class  members  were  required  to  file  their  asylum \napplications with USCIS at pain of waving initial USCIS jurisdiction over their claims. \nVAAP staff were placed in the impossible posture of either working without pay to meet \nprofessional duties to several class member clients or leaving the work piled onto my \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 084\n\n(109 of 348), Page 109 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 109 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\n \ncatastrophically  overloaded  docket  at  risk  of  permanent  legal  harm  to  clients  and \nprofessional liability for VAAP. VAAP staff worked without pay to meet their child clients’ \ndeadlines, causing undue delay to their own contingency planning to replace lost income \nand prevent rent arrearage and loss of housing.  \n17. Moreover, since February, the threat to UCP funding has closed VAAP to new legal intakes, \nincluding for unaccompanied children in deportation proceedings. Intake closure comes at \na time when DHS is ramping up enforcement and detention activities in our northern border \nstate, causing an increasing volume of indigent Vermont children and youth to enter \nremoval proceedings in Boston and Chelmsford Immigration Courts without counsel.  \n18. For existing clients, VAAP staff describes the act of strategizing on individual cases or \nmanaging their overall dockets long term as “impossible,” since they are finishing each \nworkday without knowing whether they will be returning the next. Funding threats and \nassociated uncertainty of employment is threatening legal service quality and making it \ndifficult for VAAP staff to prioritize among increasing, overlapping case emergencies.  \n19. For example, one CLIN2 subcontract client from Sudan has a pending asylum application \nand an approved USCIS Form I-360 granting Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Prior to \nseeking refuge in Vermont, Sudanese law enforcement repeatedly refused to offer client \nwith protection from the physical and verbal attacks he faced for reasons relating to his \nnationality, ethnicity, and religion. The child client was being held in ORR custody for an \nextended period in a southern U.S. state, since the SIJS sponsoring organization required \nproof of counsel in Vermont before permitting the child to be released here. Client was on \nhis way to release to Vermont with VAAP’s offer of full-scope representation, which we \nhave suddenly rescinded considering this funding loss. The child clients’ navigation of \nremoval proceedings pro se from his unnecessarily prolonged detention hangs in the \nbalance.    \n20. Another CLIN2 subcontract client from Mexico has a pending asylum application and was \njust beginning the SIJS process when funding was cut. Prior to seeking refuge in Vermont, \nthe child witnessed neighbors, friends, and peers his age tortured and killed by cartel \nmembers and their families, and all were denied assistance by local police. When the client \nbegan receiving threats that the same would happen to him, he fled. Since arriving in the \nUnited States, a severe health condition and hospitalizations have made client’s court \nappearances literally impossible to access  without  resource-intensive  assistance from \ncounsel including home visits to his rural Vermont town. Resultantly, he was up against the \nJ-O-P- deadline to file his asylum application and receive the benefits to which he was \nentitled and nearly lost out in spite of his and counsel’s heroic efforts to overcome his health \ncondition and make his filing deadline. They were just able to submit client’s meritorious \nasylum application in time, despite the odds they were up against. Client will not be able \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 085\n\n(110 of 348), Page 110 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 110 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nto continue pursuing his applications for relief without counsel, given his young age and \nfragile health.  \n21. Yet another CLIN2 subcontract client from Mexico has a pending asylum application with \nan upcoming biometrics appointment. Prior to seeking refuge in Vermont, the now 10-year-\nold child’s uncle was murdered in his presence. The same group that murdered his uncle \nthreatened our child client and attempted his kidnapping, at which point he fled for his life \nto the United States. Unfortunately, our client and the family he reunited with in the United \nStates were then subjected to severe forms of labor trafficking. After all of this, our client \nmade his way to Vermont and had just managed to secure our representation and to file his \nasylum claim when funding was cut. This young child needs our legal assistance to access \nhis upcoming biometrics appointment, to understand and prepare evidence substantiating \nhis claims, and to share his story in an asylum interview. The child client will be unable to \ncomplete his interview without the assistance of counsel, as he is incredibly shy and has \neither panic attacks or breaks into inconsolable sobs when he attempts to speak about it.  \n22. The uncertainty of future funding has prompted VAAP’s difficult decision to not renew the \ncontract of the one paralegal advocacy/program coordination person on staff and eliminate \nthe position. Now, VAAP staff is shrinking from four to three, and potentially to one, at a \ntime when the complexity and volume of unmet legal service needs are increasing.  \n23. In the interest of prioritizing professional duties owed to child clients above all else, VAAP \nis also forgoing administrative work that would reimburse staff for work-related expenses \nand replace lost funding to sustain VAAP’s ongoing operations. My professional duties to \nclients and fiscal duties to the future of VAAP are now in direct conflict because of this \ncontract cancellation. As a result of these sudden, unplanned resource constraints, existing \nchild clients are waiting longer to hear back from VAAP regarding clients’ increasingly \nfrightened requests for clarification and assistance.  \n24. Without restored funding, I will likely be the only full-time attorney at VAAP within the \nnext four-to-six weeks, rendering me solely responsible for the firm’s existing attorney-\nclient duties as well as all existing fiscal and administrative ones. My resource constraints \nand conflicting professional and administrative duties would require me to keep our intake \nclosed and to withdraw from representation in all child clients’ removal proceedings. This \nwould irreparably harm clients’ legal claims for relief and increase their likelihood of \ndeportation, as there are no other legal service providers of this type serving Vermont. Harm \nto  VAAP  clients  is  harmful  to  VAAP’s  mission-based  staff.  That  said,  continued \nrepresentation of clients under ethical obligations without funding is also harmful to staff.  \n25. Even if VAAP can diversify funding at the last minute to prevent IJC UCP staff from \nbecoming re-furloughed because of contract cancellation, the harm of February’s stop-\nwork order continues to distract staff energy and drain organizational morale.

I certify under(cid:2271)penalty(cid:2271)of(cid:2271)perjury(cid:2271)that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(cid:2271)§(cid:2271)1746.  \n1.  My name is Marion Donovan-Kaloust, and I am the Director of Legal Services of the \nChildren’s  Representation  Project  (“CRP”)  at  Immigrant  Defenders  Law  Center \n(“ImmDef”), where I have been employed for almost ten years. ImmDef is a non-profit \norganization headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with additional offices in Santa \nAna, Riverside and San Diego. ImmDef believes in providing universal representation so \nthat no immigrant is forced to face removal proceedings without an attorney or accredited \nrepresentative  at  their  side.  ImmDef  is  the  largest  provider  of  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied children in California and currently provides legal services to children \nhoused  in  seventeen  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement  (“ORR”)  facilities  throughout \nSouthern California. ImmDef also represents thousands of unaccompanied children who \nhave been released from ORR and are residing with sponsors in the Greater Los Angeles \narea.  \n2.  ImmDef’s mission and vision is  that  no immigrant  should have to face deportation \nproceedings alone. We believe that every person facing removal deserves to have zealous, \ncompetent counsel at their side. We represent approximately 3,100 noncitizens annually in \ntheir removal proceedings and provide other legal services to  approximately 33,000 \nadditional noncitizens. We provide pro bono representation and other legal services to \nunaccompanied minor children, indigent detained adults, individuals deemed mentally \nincompetent to represent themselves, deported veterans, and families separated at the \nborder, among others. Our CRP program is the largest of our departments and has primary \nresponsibility for carrying out this mission and vision as it relates to unaccompanied \nchildren. \n3.  In  order  to  carry  out  its  mission,  ImmDef’s  CRP  program  has  several  main  work \ncomponents: (1) Providing legal education “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations, \nconducting  individual  consultations  (legal  screenings),  and  making  referrals  to  legal \nservice providers for detained children who will not remain in our service area, as well as \nChild Advocate referrals and appearing as Friend of Court for unrepresented detained \nchildren;  (2)  Representing  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in \nimmigration proceedings, including children who have been released to sponsors, and those \nresiding in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (“URM”) program; and (3) Representing \nchildren in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. We represent children in short-term \nORR custody as well as children who have been placed in long-term foster care settings. \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 089\n\n(114 of 348), Page 114 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 114 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 9\nWe  further  host  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  (“IJC”)  fellows  to  represent  released \nunaccompanied children in removal proceedings and provide Spanish-language tutoring \nfor non-Spanish speaking staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  ImmDef has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nCalifornia since 2015. Providing legal services to unaccompanied children has always been \nat the core of ImmDef’s work. In 2024 alone, we provided KYRs and legal screenings to \nover 3,750 children and made over 4,200 referrals for legal services. We offered full-scope \nrepresentation to over 670 detained children and to over 175 children who had been \nreleased from ORR custody, including children placed in the URM program. ImmDef \ncurrently represents over 1,900 unaccompanied children in their removal proceedings \nunder the UCP contract.   \n5.  Of our staff of over 200, ImmDef has hired approximately 113 staff funded with U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding dedicated to providing legal \nservices  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children.  Specifically,  ImmDef’s  CRP  project \nemploys forty-three attorneys, four IJC Attorney Fellows, and thirty-eight non-attorney \nsupport staff providing direct representation services. We also employ twenty-five Program \nAssociates and Program Coordinators with primary responsibility for providing KYRs, \nlegal screenings and referrals for detained children.   \n6.  ImmDef staff providing representation and non-representation legal services (such as \nKYRs and legal screenings to children) in ORR-subcontracted facilities regularly travel to \neach such facility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for hearings, and \nprovide legal education and individual consultations. Our team visits each of the thirteen \nshort-term ORR subcontracted facilities whenever there are new arrivals, as well as when \nchildren in care need follow-up legal services (typically resulting in weekly facility visits). \nAttorneys also regularly visit children detained in each of the four long-term foster care \nprograms we serve to help them pursue their immigration cases. The vast majority of \nchildren we serve have fled dangerous circumstances in their home countries, including \ntrafficking, child abuse and neglect, and community violence. Take for example some of \nour clients—a 16-year-old girl, and her one-year-old son. Beginning at the age of six years-\nold, our older client was sex trafficked by her own family in Mexico.  After giving birth to \nher son, she fled to the U.S. to save him from the same fate. \n7.  Our office represents children like these pro bono in their removal proceedings, including \nrepresentation before immigration courts and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(“USCIS”). We also represent children before the California Superior Court in connection \nwith applications for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings (which are necessary to apply \nfor Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a form of immigration protection available to \nchildren who have experienced abuse, abandonment or neglect). We pursue victim-based \nrelief such as asylum, T-nonimmigrant status for victims of trafficking, U-nonimmigrant \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 090\n\n(115 of 348), Page 115 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 115 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 9\nstatus  for  children  who  have  experienced  crimes  in  the  United  States,  and  Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status, as well as litigating any other relief for which the children may \nbe eligible   \n8.  For detained children, we play a key role in advocating with ORR-subcontracted facilities \nand other stakeholders to ensure that children’s needs are being met while in ORR custody.  \nFor example, we make referrals to Child Advocates, advocate directly with ORR to avoid \nunnecessary “step ups” for children at risk of being placed in more restrictive detention \nsettings, and request Trafficking Victim designations from the Office of Trafficking in \nPersons. Because we are an independent, non-governmental organization, children often \nshare concerns with us they do not feel comfortable sharing with ORR-subcontracted staff \nor other stakeholders.  Thus, we are key voices for detained children—ensuring their rights \nare respected and their needs are being met while in care.  As an example, I once met with \na detained child who was wearing a thick, hooded sweatshirt with the hood up in 95+ \ndegree weather. When I asked her about it, she explained that her Muslim faith required \nher to cover her hair, but the ORR-subcontracted facility had not provided her with head \ncoverings. ImmDef was able to advocate for her religious rights to be respected and her \ncultural needs met. Every day there are new similar examples of our life-saving and life-\naffirming work.  \n9.  The children we serve range in age from infants to teenagers, and the vast majority are \nindigent (which is unsurprising given that they are children). Children, especially detained \nchildren, are still recovering from their journey and have yet to reach a place of security \nand permanency. Our team must often conduct multiple meetings with children to build \ntrust and rapport. We also serve children from diverse geographic, linguistic and cultural \nbackgrounds. While most of our staff are bilingual in Spanish and English, in recent years, \nwe have seen an increase of children from non-majority-Spanish-speaking countries, who \nrequire interpretation in order for their stories to be told and their rights to be vindicated. \nWe also often serve indigenous children from Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador who \nsimilarly require interpretation into a Mayan language or Quechua. The vast majority of \nchildren  we  serve  have  also  experienced  significant  trauma,  whether  in  their  home \ncountries, on the journey to the United States, or at the hands of U.S. Immigration Officials \n(or all three). As a result of these factors, ImmDef’s staff is highly trained to conduct our \nservices using child-friendly, trauma-informed and culturally responsive methods. Due to \nthese same factors, the children cannot be expected to represent themselves in immigration \ncourt, nor can they expect to rely on a private attorney who may charge much more than \nthey can afford, and who may lack the training and linguistic or cultural responsiveness to \neffectively represent them.  \n10. We also serve children detained in remote ORR-subcontracted facilities, far from the Los \nAngeles city center. As ORR-subcontracted bed capacity expanded in the last several years, \nImmDef was repeatedly tapped to serve children in the more remote facilities because no \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 091\n\n(116 of 348), Page 116 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 116 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 9\nother attorneys would agree to travel to those distant locations. Because of ImmDef’s \nmission and vision, and our expertise serving unaccompanied children, we agreed to take \non the work—we refused to leave children unserved, even though doing so stretched our \ncapacity. It would be unreasonable to expect that these children’s needs might be met by \nthe private bar in these underserved regions—we have seen in practice that it cannot be \ndone. \n11.  Finally, immigration is an exceedingly complex area of law that changes rapidly. Our legal \nstaff is constantly monitoring changes in case law, listservs, the news, and government \nannouncements to ensure we have up-to-date information to provide the best representation \nfor our clients. Children cannot be expected to navigate our complicated legal immigration \nsystem on their own. In fact, when ImmDef has worked with pro bono attorneys to provide \nlegal representation for children, we have found that even licensed attorneys who are not \nspecialized in this area of law need intensive training and support to be able to effectively \nrepresent their clients.   \n12. This work has resulted not only in children stabilizing their legal status but stabilizing their \nlives. Without the looming anxiety of removal proceedings, we have seen children thrive. \nOne of our clients, a youth from West Africa who faced parental abandonment and \npersecution in his home country, recently received a full-ride athletic scholarship to \ncollege.  \n13. While our work often results in positive outcomes for our child clients, we have also seen \nthat government stakeholders benefit from our work. Since its founding in 2015, ImmDef \nhas staffed the Detained Juvenile Docket, currently held on Wednesday afternoons at Santa \nAna Immigration Court. Our presence both as counsel for detained children, as well as \nFriend of Court for unrepresented children, makes the hearings run much more efficiently.  \nJudges are not required to painstakingly attempt to explain immigration law or next steps \nto children—rather, they can move quickly through hearings, because the children are \nassisted in the matters by counsel or Friend of Court. Over the years, ImmDef has appeared \nbefore multiple Immigration Judges who preside over the Detained Juvenile Docket, and \neach has expressed their gratitude for our pro bono assistance on the cases. \n14. We  have  also  developed  strong  stakeholder  relationships  with  ORR  Federal  Field \nSpecialists and ORR-subcontracted facility staff. As ORR and the subcontracted facility \nwork to care for the children, ImmDef provides key information to the children about the \nnext steps in their immigration processes and reassurances about what’s to come.  We have \noften heard from ORR-subcontracted staff that receiving appropriate immigration advice \nalleviates children’s anxiety and stress. Further, as mentioned above, we are often able to \nhelp ORR staff and ORR-subcontracted facility staff identify issues the children are facing, \nbecause children may feel more comfortable sharing these concerns with a third party.  \nWhether it’s a child sharing that they have not been provided with sufficient clean clothing, \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 092\n\n(117 of 348), Page 117 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 117 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 9\nor that they have been subjected to sexual abuse in care, our ability to note these issues and \nraise them appropriately means that children are better protected, and ORR is able to \nurgently respond to pressing needs. Over the years, we have worked alongside multiple \nFederal Field Specialists in the greater Los Angeles region who have expressed that they \nrely on and trust us to raise issues that may be occurring at the subcontracted facilities. In \nsome cases, our notifications led ORR to investigate and take corrective action against \nsubcontracted facilities.   \n15. We have also developed positive working relationships with Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”) attorneys. For example, \nwhen children who were previously enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocol (“MPP”) \nstarted entering ORR-subcontracted facilities in 2019, the government was not adequately \ntracking them. Through our work in ORR-subcontracted facilities, ImmDef was able to \nidentify these children and notify OPLA of their presence in ORR custody before they \nreceived an in absentia order for failing to appear at their immigration hearings in MPP.  A \nchild being ordered removed for failing to appear at a hearing through no fault of their own \nbecause they were in federal custody in a distant location is an illogical outcome all parties \nwanted to avoid.   \n16. The arrival of MPP-impacted children into ORR custody was just one instance when \nImmDef stepped in to fill a gap in communication between government agencies. During \nthe “Zero Tolerance” policy in 2017 and 2018, when  children were routinely being \nseparated from their parents, we found that ORR-subcontracted facilities often did not \nknow where parents were detained or how to contact them. ImmDef played a key role in \nlocating separated parents for children’s case managers to ensure that parents and children \nhad contact, and that ORR knew where parents were being held. More recently, we have \nseen the same pattern play out, with parents being separated from their children because \nthey are serving as material witnesses, because of hospitalizations, or for a number of other \nreasons. ImmDef has been the first to identify the separation and flag it for ORR, to locate \nthe separated parent, and to assist in troubleshooting barriers to communication between \nthe child and parent in multiple instances. Thus, we have seen that ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities often rely on ImmDef to bridge gaps in communication or tracking of families \nbetween government agencies that interact with the children. \n17. On March 21, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) partially terminated \nthe  current  contract  with Acacia  Center  for  Justice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a \nsubcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  children.  Effective \nimmediately, HHS’ terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line \nNumbers (CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children as well as \nother non-representation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2, and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 093\n\n(118 of 348), Page 118 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 118 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 9\nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than “the \nGovernment’s convenience.”  \n18. At around 8:15 AM on Friday March 21, our office received an email from the Acacia \nCenter for Justice notifying us of the contract termination they had received from the \nDepartment of the Interior. ImmDef staff was already in our offices, on the way to hearings, \nand preparing to meet with detained clients.  Our work was unable to stop as requested due \nto our ethical responsibilities under California Attorney Ethics rules to zealously represent \nour clients and avoid prejudice to their cases.    \n19.  Over the ten years that ImmDef has participated in the contract, ImmDef has built an active \nclient caseload of 1,900 clients and has represented nearly 4,000 children in total.  We have \nprovided non-representation legal services to over 25,000 children.  We hired staff and \nopened satellite offices to meet the demands of contract deliverables and ensure children \nin need were being served. While no individual contract year was ever guaranteed, we \nrelied on the fact that these services are mandated in the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act  (“TVPRA”)  and  the  multi-year  nature  of  the  contract  to  make \ndecisions regarding our organization’s growth.  The abrupt termination of the contract puts \nthe organization as a whole in peril.  Funding impacted by the contract termination makes \nup approximately 55% of ImmDef’s budget.   \n20. As mentioned above, we employ 113 of our approximately 200-person staff under this \ngrant.  While we have limited flexible funding that has allowed us to continue to employ \nstaff  to  discharge  our  ethical  responsibilities  to  our  clients  following  the  contract \ntermination  we  cannot  continue  for  long  without  reinstatement  of  unaccompanied \nchildren’s funding.  Our current reserves will be completely exhausted within six months, \nand  dramatic  cuts  in  staffing  will  be  needed  well  before  that  to  avoid  completely \nbankrupting the organization. In fact, we have already had to provide 27 staff with layoff \nnotices in response to the contract termination. Further, before the contract termination, our \nreserves were intended to fund other mission-focused work such as providing pro se clinics \nto new arrivals and rapid response to immigration raids.  Reallocating those reserves to \nfund the children’s work would have negative ripple effects across our entire organization. \nWe have taken additional steps to prevent further dipping into our reserves, including \nstopping any non-essential support for clients, such as helping to pay for medical exams \nneeded for adjustment of status applications, and putting a pause on all non-essential office \nsupply purchases. \n21. As reserves run out, we would have to take drastic action to terminate staff across all \npositions funded under this contract.  As mentioned, we have already sent layoff notices to \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 094\n\n(119 of 348), Page 119 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 119 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 9\n27 staff, but additional layoffs would be necessary were the funding not restored. These \ncuts would be incompatible with our ethical responsibilities to the over 1,900 child clients \nwe currently represent. We have limited ability to retrain and reassign staff to other \nprograms under other funding sources.  Prior to each grant or contract year, agreements are \noutlined, and existing staff are identified within each program for the contract or grant year, \nwhich  results  in  little  room  for  unexpected  shifts  in  already  approved  budgets. \nRestructuring  other grants  to  absorb  unaccompanied  children’s  staff  mid-year  is  not \nfeasible, and we don’t have the capacity or the ability to absorb over 1,900 cases into other \nattorneys’ caseloads. Furthermore, retraining staff takes time and resources—resources that \nour organization does not have without this funding.  \n22. Additional furloughs and layoffs are inevitable if we are not able to restore funding. \nHowever, as mentioned—we have over 1,900 open children’s cases. Laying off staff \nfunded under this grant would prevent us from competently representing our existing child \nclients.  In response to a prior stop work order, we instituted a hiring freeze, which will \nremain ongoing in light of the contract cancelation.  There are open positions of case-\ncarrying attorneys and paralegals that we cannot fill, putting additional strain on a team \nthat will be further exacerbated in light of the contract termination. \n23. The contract termination presents an immediate existential threat to ImmDef’s existence \nand to our mission. The contract termination froze, without notice, funding to represent \nnearly 2000 children with whom we undertook attorney-client relationships in reliance on \nthat funding. These cases are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly \nskilled attorneys to competently handle them. For example, our office filed an asylum \napplication for one youth from West Africa in February 2025. He. is currently awaiting an \ninterview with the asylum office. As a speaker of a language from the Niger-Congo \nlanguage family, his case requires specialized translations and in-depth country conditions \nresearch. His case could be pending before the asylum office for years, and without \nrepresentation at the ready, he risks having to present his asylum case before USCIS alone.  \n24. Currently, we have over twenty-five immigration and state court hearings for children \nwhose representation is funded under the contract scheduled in the week following the \ncontract termination, including one for a 4-year-old child from Mexico. It would be \nimpossible to withdraw from these cases on such short notice without seriously prejudicing \nour clients—if the courts would even allow us to do so.  \n25. It has been a full-time job, as the leader of our Children’s Representation Project, to field \nquestions from staff about what the abrupt contract termination means for them and for \ntheir clients. It has been a challenge to keep staff focused on representing clients while they \nunderstandably feel panic about whether they will even have a job tomorrow. While we \ncontinue to provide key non-representational services and represent existing clients, the \ncontract termination has forced us to stop offering new representation to children currently \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 095\n\n(120 of 348), Page 120 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 120 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 9\ndetained. At  this  very  moment,  there  are  children  in  ORR  custody  who  need  our \nrepresentation who are not receiving it. This means that children who want voluntary \ndeparture will have their return home unacceptably delayed, victims of trafficking will not \nbe able to access the protections they deserve, and children fleeing persecution will not be \nable to have their day in court. These impacts are unacceptable to an organization founded \non the belief that no child—some of whose feet don’t even touch the floor when they sit in \ncourt—should have to face a trained government prosecutor alone. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 24 of March 2025, in Riverside, California.          \n            \n \n___________________________  \nMarion (\"Mickey\") Donovan-Kaloust \nImmigrant Defenders Law Center \n634 S.

I  certify \nunder penalty of perjury that  the  following  statement  is  true  and  correct  pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My  name  is  Joel  Frost-Tift,  and  I  am  the  Senior  Supervising  Attorney  of  the \nUnaccompanied Children’s Team at Public Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm in \nLos Angeles dedicated to advancing civil rights and racial and economic justice, as well as \nto amplifying the power of our clients through comprehensive legal advocacy. Public \nCounsel is one of the primary organizations dedicated to providing legal services to \nindigent unaccompanied immigrant children who are released from Office of Refugee \nResettlement (ORR) custody throughout the greater Los Angeles area.  \n2.  The Unaccompanied Children’s team is the largest of four teams within the Immigrants’ \nRights  Project  at  Public  Counsel. The  Immigrants’  Rights  Project  practices  holistic, \ntrauma-informed advocacy, recognizing that our clients come to us with extraordinary \nstrengths, but also vulnerability due to the violence many have experienced through forced \nmigration and our dysfunctional immigration system. Our team of advocates collaborates \nwith immigrant clients and communities to fight fearlessly for legal protections and a just \nimmigration system. \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, Public Counsel represents unaccompanied children who \nare not in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. We further host Immigrant Justice \nCorps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings and \nprovide Spanish-language tutoring for staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  Public Counsel has been providing legal services for unaccompanied children funded by \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the greater Los Angeles area \nsince 2014. Public Counsel serves around 200 unaccompanied children each year.  \n5.  Public Counsel currently has 14 staff members funded by HHS who are dedicated to \nproviding legal services to unaccompanied children. They are a supervising attorney, a \nprogram  manager,  six  staff  attorneys,  one  IJC  fellow,  one  social  worker,  one  case \ncoordinator, and three paralegals.  \n6.  Public Counsel provides full scope representation, which includes representation in state \ncourts, in removal proceedings before the immigration court, in appellate proceedings \nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals, in petitions for review in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in applications for affirmative humanitarian relief like \nasylum  and  Special  Immigrant  Juvenile  Status  before  USCIS.  Our  staff  frequently \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 098\n\n(123 of 348), Page 123 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 123 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-9     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 4\nrepresent clients in the Los Angeles, Orange County, and Van Nuys immigration courts, \nthe Los Angeles Asylum Office, and state courts in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, \nRiverside, Ventura and  Santa Barbara counties. We also provide  Know Your Rights \nservices to communities throughout Southern California.  \n7.  Public Counsel has witnessed pro se children in court struggle to articulate their claims due \nto their age, language barriers, and the complexity of immigration law. Most of these \nchildren cannot afford private attorneys, so the loss of the HHS funding would prove \ndevastating for them since it would greatly decrease the number of providers who could \nrepresent them.  \n8.  Our  Unaccompanied  Children’s  team  receives  referrals  from  existing  clients,  the \ncommunity, and the online Acacia Center for Justice referral database system. Once we \nreceive a referral we conduct a brief phone screening, followed by a more in-depth intake \nbefore initiating representation of a child by signing a representation agreement. When we \nhave capacity to take on cases, we accept all cases that are eligible under HHS funding \nguidelines where the child resides within our service area.  \n9.  Immigration judges have often expressed gratitude to Public Counsel for the efficiency we \nbring to their dockets, and they have referred children to Public Counsel. They have \nremarked to our clients that they are lucky to have such quality representation.  \n10. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all four Contract Line Numbers (CLINs) of the \ncontract for which Public Counsel is a subcontractor of the Acacia Center for Justice: (1) \nKYR presentations and legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities; (2) Legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children not in ORR custody; (3) Legal representation \nfor unaccompanied  children in ORR custody;  and (4) Spanish-language tutoring  for \norganizational staff who work with children. Without further elaboration on duration or \nreasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain in place until you are notified \notherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside of your control and should not \nbe misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n11. Members of Public Counsel learned of the stop work order suddenly on February 18, 2025, \nwhen we received communications from the Acacia Center for Justice and from the Center \nfor Gender and Refugee Studies abruptly informing us that trainings and officer hours had \nbeen cancelled. Then, just as suddenly, HHS rescinded the stop work order on February 21, \n2025. \n12. On March 21, 2025, again without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated this same contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice for which Public Counsel is a subcontractor. This termination was effective the \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 099\n\n(124 of 348), Page 124 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 124 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-9     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 4\nsame day, March 21, 2025. HHS terminated the contract with respect to three of the four \nContract Line Numbers CLINs: (1) CLIN2, Legal representation for unaccompanied \nchildren not in ORR custody; (2) CLIN3, Legal representation for unaccompanied children \nin ORR custody; and (3) CLIN4, Spanish-language tutoring for organizational staff who \nwork with children. For now, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe partial termination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors—which includes Public \nCounsel—to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification \nfor the partial termination other than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n13. HHS provides about $1 million per year in funding for 14 of the 15 staff members on Public \nCounsel’s  Unaccompanied  Children’s  Team.  This  accounts  for  about  5%  of  Public \nCounsel’s annual operating budget. Without this funding, we will be unable to maintain \nthis staffing of the Unaccompanied Children’s team. This loss of staff would have a \ndevastating impact on our ability to continue to represent unaccompanied children.  \n14. The partial contract termination and the uncertainty of continued HHS funding have had a \nserious deleterious effect on morale within the organization. Members of our staff have \nstated their intention to look for other jobs because of the need for reliable continued \nemployment. The anxiety that the  partial contract termination and the uncertainty has \ncaused our staff as well as the time we have devoted to contingency planning have impacted \nour ability to focus squarely on representing our clients. In addition, we are unable to take \non new clients due to the funding uncertainty.  \n15. Children without representation are much more likely to be denied relief and ordered \nremoved to countries where they fear harm, contrary to Public Counsel’s mission of \nadvancing civil rights and justice for all.  \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 22nd of March 2025, in Burbank, CA.           \n            \n_______________________________  \nSenior Supervising Attorney \nUnaccompanied Children’s Team \nPublic Counsel \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 100\n\n(125 of 348), Page 125 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 125 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF VANESSA \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nGUTIERREZ (NWIRP) IN SUPPORT OF \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and correct pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Vanessa Gutierrez, and I am the Deputy Director at Northwest Immigrant \nRights Project (“NWIRP”) who oversees NWIRP’s Unaccompanied Children Program \n(“UCP”). NWIRP provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth \nwho have been released from Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody to sponsors \nthroughout Washington State.  \n3.  NWIRP has provided legal services through UCP since 2022. We expanded to provide In-\nPerson Post-Release Legal Services to children and youth released from emergency ORR \nfacilities in 2023, and we expanded again to provide representation to youth entering the \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 102\n\n(127 of 348), Page 127 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 127 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 6\nURM program in February 2025. NWIRP has over 500 open UCP cases in which we are \nproviding direct legal representation to unaccompanied children and youth released from \nORR custody. \n4.  With funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), NWIRP \ncurrently has 20.9 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff members dedicated to providing direct \nlegal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth. Specifically, we have a \ndirecting attorney, 3.65 FTE supervising attorneys, 8.7 FTE staff attorneys, 7 FTE legal \nadvocates, and one social services advocate. In addition to these staff, NWIRP has three \nFTE Immigrant Justice Corps (IJC) fellow attorneys who provide direct representation for \nunaccompanied children and youth in removal proceedings.  \n5.  NWIRP UCP staff represent unaccompanied children and youth in removal proceedings in \nimmigration  court,  BIA  appeals,  affirmative  relief  before  USCIS  (including  asylum, \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification, Adjustment of Status, T visas and U visas), \nand state court cases (including dependencies, minor guardianships, parenting plans, and \nvulnerable youth guardianships). Staff must regularly travel to the Seattle Immigration \nCourt, and occasionally the Portland Immigration Court, as well as state courts throughout \nWashington for court filings and hearings.  \n6.  NWIRP’s UCP Program provides critical legal services to unaccompanied children and \nyouth, who are not guaranteed appointment of counsel in removal proceedings. Most \nunaccompanied children and youth in our state lack the financial resources to be able to \nhire private immigration attorneys. There are not many attorneys in Washington state who \nprovide representation in removal proceedings for unaccompanied children and youth or \nin state court for SIJ-eligible children and youth, especially on a low bono or pro bono \nbasis. Due to their young age (we have represented UCP clients as young as 1 year old), \nthe  trauma  they  may  have  experienced,  language  barriers,  and  the  complexity  of \nimmigration law, it is not realistic to expect unaccompanied children and youth to attempt \nto apply for immigration relief before USCIS, pursue state court cases, or advocate for \nthemselves in immigration court without an attorney.  \n7.  NWIRP successfully serves children and youth in rural and urban areas of Washington \nState. When we receive a referral for a UCP-eligible child, we direct the referral to the UCP \nteam at the NWIRP office that covers the county where the child lives and schedule an \nindividual  consultation.  If  the  child  would  like  NWIRP  to  represent  them  in  their \nimmigration case, we accept their case on a universal representation basis, without regard \nfor the type of relief they may qualify for or the strength of their case. We then assign their \ncase to an attorney, or a legal advocate working in collaboration with an attorney. When \npossible, for children and youth who are eligible for SIJ classification, we try to place their \nstate court case with a pro bono attorney. We regularly engage in pro bono recruitment and \nmentorship, and we periodically offer training to pro bono attorneys. When NWIRP is \n2 \n \n\n(128 of 348), Page 128 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 128 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 6\nunable to find a pro bono attorney, we take on the state court case in-house. We provide \nin-house representation on the immigration case before the immigration court and USCIS.  \n8.  For  most  of  NWIRP’s  UCP  clients,  we  represent  them  in  their  first  appearance  in \nimmigration court. Many of our UCP clients have never been to any court ever in their life \nbefore their first immigration court hearing. Before their hearing, their assigned NWIRP \nattorney meets with them to explain what to expect during the hearing, including who will \nbe present, what the layout of the courtroom will be, what the immigration judge may ask \nduring the hearing, what their NWIRP advocate may say on their behalf, and what some \npossible outcomes of their hearing may be. We review the factual allegations and charges \nof  removability  in  their  Notice  to  Appear  with  them,  and  we  review  the  forms  of \nimmigration relief that we have already discussed with them, making sure they fully \nunderstand and that we answer any questions they have. This preparation helps put the \nchild or youth more at ease, helps ensure their presence at their scheduled hearing, and \nhelps the hearing run more efficiently and smoothly because the child better understands \nwhat is happening. \n9.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  four  Contract  Line  Numbers  (CLINs). \nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February \n21, 2025. Even this short lapse in funding negatively impacted NWIRP’s UCP work. The \nstop work order created confusion among staff over how to categorize and memorialize the \nwork they continued to do on behalf of our clients, adding extra timekeeping requirements \nthat took away valuable time that could have been spent advocating for clients. During the \nstop  work  order,  we  continued  the  direct  representation  and  legal  services  without \ninterruption, as ethically required by the Rules of Professional Conduct in Washington \nState, but we did not know if we would ever be reimbursed for our work while the stop \nwork order was in effect. Even after NWIRP submitted a Request for Equitable Adjustment  \nfor the work completed while the stop work order was in effect, it was communicated to \nNWIRP that our submissions are “not” official invoices and that our submission “does not” \nguarantee reimbursement and we were told that it “will ultimately be decided by the \ngovernment.” \n10. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers (CLINs):   \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 104\n\n(129 of 348), Page 129 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 129 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 6\nCLIN2,  Legal  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  as  well  as  other  non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children.   \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. For NWIRP, this results in a full termination of our entire UCP contract. \nHHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than “the Government’s \nconvenience.”  \n11. NWIRP learned about this contract termination through an email communication from \nAcacia Center for Justice, sent at 8:15 a.m. on March 21, 2025 to NWIRP’s Executive \nDirector, Malou Chávez. The title of the email was “Urgent: Notice of Partial Termination \nfor the Government’s Convenience.” Acacia hosted a meeting for further discussion of the \ncontract termination. \n12. While NWIRP is still considering how to respond to the contract termination, we are \ncommitted to continuing to represent existing clients, at least in the short term. Our \norganization’s ability to continue representing clients long-term depends on many factors, \nincluding whether any case continuity funding might be available to support the winding \ndown of the contract through HHS. \n13. UCP funding represents approximately 10% of NWIRP’s overall annual budget. Loss of \nfunding impacts 28 staff (20.9 FTEs) at NWIRP. Over the short-term, NWIRP aims to \nmaintain all positions to ensure continuity of representation. The organization will do so \nby borrowing from its reserves and by seeking support from donors and is currently in the \nprocess of determining how long this solution will sustain the services previously funded \nby the UCP contract. Sustaining services will cost NWIRP at least $200,000 per month. \nSince NWIRP provides extensive legal services beyond its UCP contract, it must consider \nall of its mission-focused work when determining use of limited reserve funding or donor \nresources. Any funds that NWIRP directs to sustain services under this contract take away \nfrom other critical services that NWIRP is committed to providing in the community, \nespecially during this period of exponentially-increased demand for immigration legal \nservices. We anticipate that NWIRP will be unable to sustain services over the long-term \nand will need to reduce its staff accordingly. \n14. The UCP contract termination detrimentally impacts NWIRP’s mission to promote justice \nby defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic \nadvocacy, and community education. Research has shown that unrepresented children and \nyouth are more likely to be issued an order of removal, even if they have a strong \nimmigration claim, demonstrating the high need for legal representation in these cases. \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 105\n\n(130 of 348), Page 130 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 130 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 6\nWhile NWIRP aims to continue representation in as many cases as possible, we will have \nextremely limited capacity to assist children and youth who need representation in the \nfuture,  negatively  impacting  their  chances  of  gaining  immigration  relief  and  likely \nchanging the trajectory of their lives.  \n15. Having to turn away youth from services is difficult for our committed legal staff, many of \nwhom are immigrants themselves and share an understanding of the experiences the \nchildren and youth are facing. Contract termination will undoubtedly negatively impact the \nmorale of staff who already work under challenging conditions in the immigration system. \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the District of Columbia that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 21st of March 2025, in Wenatchee, Washington.          \n            \n_______________________________  \nVanessa Gutierrez \nDeputy Director \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project  \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 106\n\n(131 of 348), Page 131 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 131 of 348\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ASHLEY T. \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nHARRINGTON (RMIAN) IN SUPPORT \n \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nv.

HARRINGTON \nCHILDREN’S PROGRAM MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR THE \nROCKY MOUNTAIN IMMIGRANT ADVOCACY NETWORK \nI, Ashley T. Harrington make the following statements on behalf of the Rocky Mountain \nImmigrant Advocacy Network.  I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is \ntrue and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746. \n1. My name is Ashley T. Harrington, and I am the Children’s Program Managing Attorney at \nthe Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”). RMIAN is a Colorado-\nbased nonprofit organization that provides free immigration legal and social services to \nindividuals in civil immigration detention, as well as to immigrant children and families. \nThrough its staff attorneys, paralegals, social workers, and a network of hundreds of pro \nbono attorneys, RMIAN provides legal education and free legal representation to low-\nincome immigrants who otherwise would not be able to afford an attorney.\n2. RMIAN’s primary programs are 1) the Detention Program which provides free legal \nservices to individuals in civil detention; 2) the Children’s Program which provides free \nlegal services to children and families in immigration proceedings; and 3) the Social \nService  project  which  provides  comprehensive  supportive  services  to  particularly \nvulnerable individuals, children and families.\n3. RMIAN is the primary organization dedicated to providing legal services to indigent \nunaccompanied immigrant children in Colorado. Specifically, RMIAN provides free legal \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children who have been released from the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement (“ORR”) to sponsors, to unaccompanied children who have been \nplaced in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program, and to unaccompanied children in \nORR Long-Term Foster Care. RMIAN previously also provided free legal services to \nchildren in ORR short-term shelters in Colorado.\n4. RMIAN has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nColorado through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding since \nthe first ORR short-term shelter opened in Colorado in 2019. RMIAN provided know-\nyour-rights presentations, individual legal screenings, legal representation and referrals to \nhundreds of youth in ORR custody in Colorado from December 2019 through May 2023 \nwhen the shelters closed.\n5. RMIAN has continued providing representation to unaccompanied children who were \nreleased from ORR custody—both from the shelters in Colorado as well as shelters all over \nthe country. With HHS funding, RMIAN is currently representing 160 unaccompanied \nchildren, including unaccompanied children released to individual sponsors and children \nreleased into the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program. In addition, RMIAN recently\n1\nStay Motion Addendum 108\n\n(133 of 348), Page 133 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 133 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nexpanded its services to provide representation to children in the ORR Long-Term Foster \nCare program placed in Colorado.  \n6.  With HHS funding, RMIAN currently employs approximately six full-time-equivalent \nstaff dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children. This \nincludes a managing attorney, staff attorneys, a law clerk, coordinators, a paralegal, and an \nadministrative assistant.   \n7.  RMIAN represents unaccompanied children in removal proceedings in immigration court \nand in humanitarian relief applications before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nincluding  asylum, Special  Immigrant  Juvenile Status,  U and T nonimmigrant  status, \nadjustment of status to lawful permanent residency, and applications for employment \nauthorization. In addition, RMIAN staff attorneys and pro bono partners represent children \nin state court proceedings, including guardianship, allocation of parental responsibilities \nand child welfare proceedings.   \n8.  RMIAN has initiated representation with unaccompanied children as young as two years \nup to those on the eve of their eighteenth birthday. None of these children are fluent in \nEnglish or have received higher education. These children’s cases require navigating a \ncomplicated maze of laws and legal processes necessary to secure lawful status and defend \nfrom  deportation.  Most  require  analysis  of  both  state  and  federal  laws  and  require \nsimultaneous applications and motions before the immigration court, a State court and U.S. \nCitizenship  and  Immigration  Services.  Each  of  these  forums  have  specific,  detailed \nprocedures that must be followed to ensure cases don’t result in rejection or denial. \nChildren’s legal cases often take several years to ultimately result in lawful permanent \nresidency, requiring constant monitoring and regular required filings during the lengthy \nprocess. It would be virtually impossible for a child to successfully navigate all the \nrequirements to avoid deportation and successfully obtain lawful status without an attorney.  \n9.  The unaccompanied children RMIAN represents have often been through complex and \nsignificant trauma. Many of RMIAN’s child clients have been subjected to sex and labor \ntrafficking, child abuse, neglect and abandonment, sexual abuse and other violence. Many \nof  the  applications  for  legal  protection  require  detailed  declarations  and  interviews \nregarding the trauma and abuse these children have endured—something that would be \nincredibly difficult to endure without a trauma-informed attorney’s assistance.  \n10. RMIAN’s services are not only beneficial to the children in removal proceedings, but also \nto immigration judges, court staff and government attorneys. RMIAN has built strong \nrelationships with Denver’s immigration judges and staff as well as attorneys for the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA). \nRMIAN routinely meets with immigration judges and staff along with OPLA to discuss \nhow to improve services and efficiency. RMIAN has worked jointly with OPLA to request \nand  obtain  dismissal  of  removal  proceedings  for  dozens  of  unaccompanied  children \n2 \n \n\n(134 of 348), Page 134 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 134 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\npursuing relief applications with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, thereby \npreserving the court and OPLA’s time and resources for cases ripe for resolution by the \ncourt. In addition, when a RMIAN attorney enters their appearance with the immigration \ncourt, typically the next hearing is cancelled and written deadlines are provided, thereby \nsaving the court’s limited time for other cases. RMIAN routinely receives requests from \nimmigration court staff and judges to assist unaccompanied children and families with \nanything from a change of address form to a screening for potential human trafficking.  \nRMIAN ensures that children are fully informed of their rights and options and, wherever \npossible, that they have expert legal representation to navigate the immigration legal \nsystem more efficiently and effectively. Without RMIAN, removal proceedings would take \nfar longer and the dockets would be clogged with cases that are not even under the court’s \njurisdiction while a child is pursuing legal status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. Immigration judges and court staff regularly express gratitude for the ways in \nwhich RMIAN’s services assist the court.  \n11. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025. \n \n12. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied  children.  This  termination  was  effective  the  same  day,  March  21, \n2025.HHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers \n(CLINs): CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non- \nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows and Randstad placements who represent unaccompanied \nchildren  not  covered  under  CLIN  2;  and  CLIN  4,  Spanish  language  tutoring  for \norganizational staff who work with children. For the time being, HHS has left in place only \nCLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se \nchildren in  ORR facilities. Per the partial termination,  HHS ordered Acacia and  all \nsubcontractors  to  stop  work  immediately  on  CLINs  2,  3,  and  4.  HHS  provided  no \njustification for the partial termination other than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n13. RMIAN received news of both the stop work order and the notice of contract termination \nfrom the Acacia Center for Justice via email. RMIAN staff had to immediately pivot from \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 110\n\n(135 of 348), Page 135 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 135 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nproviding representation to children to informing all staff of the stop work order and \ncontract termination and planning for its impact on RMIAN’s services and funding. \n14. Funding from HHS for unaccompanied children’s legal services comprises approximately \n15%  of  RMIAN’s  total  annual budget and  26%  of  its  Children’s  Program  Budget—\napproximately  $772,000  this  year.  Because  there  are  currently  no  ORR  shelters  in \nColorado, RMIAN does not receive any funding for CLIN1 services to children in ORR \ncustody. Thus, the partial contract termination serves as a complete termination of all \nfunding for RMIAN’s work under the contract.  \n15. HHS funding currently allows RMIAN to employ approximately six full-time-equivalent \nstaff  positions, including  attorneys,  a  law  clerk,  coordinators,  a  paralegal  and  an \nadministrative assistant. It remains uncertain whether staff and client cases could be shifted \nto other funding sources. RMIAN would need to pull from its reserves and limited \nunrestricted funds to continue paying staff and providing representation to unaccompanied \nchildren. This would only be possible on a temporary basis until layoffs would need to be \nconsidered. \n When news of the stop work order broke, RMIAN received panicked calls from children, \ntheir caregivers, foster care providers, and case managers worried that the stop work order \nmeant  that  RMIAN  would  no  longer  provide  representation.  Similar  panic  ensued \nfollowing the news of the contract termination. Instead of focusing on preparing children’s \nlegal applications, RMIAN staff had to respond to countless calls and inquiries about how \nthe stop work order and contract termination would impact its child clients. While RMIAN \nhas  been  able  to  provide  temporary  reassurance  that  children  will  continue  to  be \nrepresented using RMIAN’s reserves and limited unrestricted funding, its staff will be \nunable to provide such assurances long-term.  \n17. RMIAN firmly believes that no child should be forced to navigate immigration legal \nproceedings alone, and that every child deserves to have an attorney to inform them of their \nrights and options and to represent them in any defenses they may qualify for under the \nlaw. In reliance on the government’s consistent funding, RMIAN has been steadily building \nits Children’s Program to be able to increase how many children it is able to serve each \nyear.  RMIAN  hopes  to  continue  expanding  programming  and  staffing  so  that  more \nunaccompanied children in Colorado have access to expert legal representation. However, \nwithout HHS funding, not only will RMIAN not be able to provide representation to any \nadditional children, but the ability to provide continued representation to current child \nclients is also under threat.  \n18. RMIAN  has  relied  upon  the  government’s  consistent  funding  of  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied  children  in  building  its  Children’s  Program,  and  in  crafting  the \nrepresentational agreements RMIAN has executed with child clients. In reliance on the \ngovernment’s  consistent  funding  consistent  with  congressional  appropriations,  the \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 111\n\n(136 of 348), Page 136 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 136 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nTVPRA, the Foundational  Rule, and in accordance with  RMIAN’s subcontract  with \nAcacia, RMIAN’s representation agreements with most unaccompanied children include a \ncommitment to continue representation through obtaining asylum, U/T nonimmigrant \nstatus, or permanent residency, if they are eligible for this relief under U.S. law. For most \nof RMIAN’s clients, this means that it has promised to continue representation for several \nyears due to extreme delays and backlogs in processing and adjudications of these relief \napplications.  \n19. RMIAN has legally and ethically binding obligations to its clients to continue providing \nrepresentation despite this halt in funding. Ethical rules require attorneys to continue \nrepresentation to the conclusion of the matters undertaken on behalf of clients. Withdrawal \nmay only be permitted under ethical rules if withdrawal would not be materially adverse \nto the client’s case. Withdrawal from children’s cases would be materially adverse because \nthey cannot competently represent themselves in matters before the immigration court, the \nstate court, or before USCIS, they could not afford private counsel to represent them, and \nwithdrawal would more than likely lead to their cases being denied—resulting in their \nremoval.  \n20. RMIAN is committed to continuing to represent its child clients despite this termination of \nfunding. However, it will have to pull from limited reserves and unrestricted funding to do \nso, and may have to consider staff layoffs. Ultimately, if significant layoffs become \nnecessary, despite the significant detrimental impact on clients, RMIAN may need to \nconsider withdrawing from clients’ cases if it does not have sufficient staff to continue \nrepresentation.  \n21. RMIAN will have to dedicate its limited staff time to fundraising to try to raise the funds \nnecessary to continue providing representation, with no guarantee of success. This diverts \nlimited time and resources away from providing representation. It also diverts limited \nfunding for representation of other clients as well as funding that allows for staff leave and \nbenefits, staff wellness initiatives, and necessary organizational infrastructure. The stop \nwork order caused great distress among staff, but was short-lived. The termination of \nfunding has significantly impacted staff morale and caused staff stress and concern about \nwhether they will continue to have a job and be able to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. Even if layoffs don’t become immediately necessary, this worry may cause staff \nto leave RMIAN for employment that is more securely funded. This would leave RMIAN \nshort-staffed and place more of the burden to continue representation on fewer staff, and \nwould increase the likelihood RMIAN would have to consider withdrawal from clients’ \ncases.  \n22.  Any interruption, reduction or termination in HHS funding significantly harms RMIAN \nand its mission to provide legal representation to unaccompanied children.  \n \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 112\n\n(137 of 348), Page 137 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 137 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n Executed on the 22nd day of March 2025, in Westminster, Colorado.       \n                \n_______________________________  \nAshley T.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My  name  is  Gautam  Jagannath,  and  I  am  the  Executive  Director  at  Social  Justice \nCollaborative (“SJC”).  We are based in Berkeley, California in the San Francisco Bay Area \nand have been provided full-scope deportation defense services for low-income noncitizens \nall over the nine Bay Area counties as well as the California central valley. SJC is one of \nthe primary organizations dedicated to providing legal services to indigent unaccompanied \nimmigrant children who are not in detention as well as those held in Office of Refugee \nResettlement (“ORR”) custody throughout Northern and Central California.  \n2.  Our organization teams are composed of administration, executive staff, attorneys, legal \nassistants, social workers and other individuals who work together in units to represent \nclients, ensure that their needs are met and that we continually prevail in court.  Because \nwe are a legal services organization, we operate like a law office and our teams depend on \nhaving lawyers and legal assistants work on all aspects of the case, from intake to work-up \nand preparation for trial. \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, SJC has several main work components, but relevant to \nthe instant litigation, we represent unaccompanied minors who are not in ORR custody in \nimmigration proceedings. We further host Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) fellows to \nrepresent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings.  Our programs at SJC are \nunique because we have always provided full-scope representation to vitally underserved \nminors as well as families, but we also provide access to wrap around services including \nsocial workers to help navigate challenges of newcomer life in the United States. \n4.  SJC has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in California \nsince 2012. Since our inception, we have always taken cases for any indigent immigrant in \nCalifornia, we represent thousands of families a year.  Our unaccompanied minor clients \nrepresent about a third of all we represent in immigration proceedings. Specifically, SJC \nserves a combined annual number of around over 400 unaccompanied children. Roughly \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 115\n\n(140 of 348), Page 140 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 140 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nfor at least the fiscal year 2024, our representative breakdown for these minors was 35% \nadjustment of status, 38% asylum proceedings, 25% special juvenile status.  The residue \nbalance is composed of U/T nonimmigrant relief, refugee petitions and other applications. \nNaturally, a lot of work authorizations are not included for all these children to get kids the \nbenefits,  both  entitlements  and  means  tested  that  they  deserve  in  California.    That \nrepresents over 200 applications just in FY 2024. \n5.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, SJC currently has \nhired three (3) staff members, all of whom are IJC fellows, dedicated to providing legal \nservices to unaccompanied immigrant children. Specifically, one is a California lawyer and \ntwo of the staff members are law graduates with pending bar admission results. \n6.  Staff providing representation to children regularly conduct client interviews, prepare \nclients for hearings, as well as provide legal education, individual consultations, and attend \ncourt hearings and other appointments for clients as well as their families. SJC represents \nchildren in all stage of removal proceedings in immigration court, BIA appeals, petitions \nfor  review  at  the  Ninth  Circuit,  affirmative  relief  like  asylum  before  USCIS,  SIJS \npredicates in state court. \n7.  In recent months, we have had several referrals come from youth-serving professionals \nwho are actively trying to find help for the children they work with. Even those who \nregularly refer to legal service providers are hitting roadblocks. Waitlists are closed. Pro \nbono and nonprofit providers are overwhelmed. Paying for legal services is out of reach \nfor the vast majority of adult immigrants let alone children who need to be in school. \n8.  We routinely place cases for that have made their way through the immigration system to \npro bono counsel at our firm partners through our legal clinics.  These legal clinics are held \nfrequently throughout the year and would be severely, albeit indirectly, affected by the loss \nof funding through this grant.  \n9.  In 2023, SJC’s new Special Immigrant Juvenile (“SIJ”) Task Force completed its first full \nyear. The task force was created in response to the growing demand for legal representation \nfor minors. This was based on an increased number of intakes and referrals. However, \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 116\n\n(141 of 348), Page 141 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 141 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nconversations with partners across various sectors made it clear this was not an isolated \nissue. It reflected broader, statewide, and national trends. \n10. SJC is one of the few organizations who works in areas considered legal deserts in \nCalifornia. In some of these regions, we are one of the only organizations offering any legal \nservices, including full-scope removal defense.  We do not merely fill forms for clients and \nwish them luck. Even in more populated counties where other providers exist, the demand \nstill far exceeds what’s available. \n11. A partner recently shared that a very young immigrant child believed that carrying a red \ncard—a know-your-rights resource widely distributed in immigrant communities—would \nprevent them from being detained if stopped. While red cards are an important tool for \nasserting one’s rights, this child was under the impression that the card functioned more \nlike a legal shield. It’s easy to understand how a young person, without legal guidance, \ncould draw that conclusion not knowing much more.  \n \n12. Stories like this make it painfully clear that general information, no matter how widely \nshared, is not a substitute for individualized legal support. Children need someone who \ncan walk them through their options and answer their questions.  That is where SJC often \ncomes in.  We have a team of legal professionals working up and prevailing on legal sta-\ntus, but we also are providing social workers to support our children.  \n13. We currently have clients who are not yet one year old. Even without considering trauma, \nlanguage barriers, or lack of resources, there is no path forward for a child that young \nwithout help. But of course, we do have to consider those things. Many of our clients are \nindigenous and do not speak Spanish, a language many assume they would speak. These \nminors often face not only trauma and language access issues but also deep cultural barriers \nand a long-standing experience with systems that overlook or ignore them. This makes it \nextremely difficult—if not impossible—for children to find legal representation, let alone \nsecure it in time to meet the deadlines in their cases. \n14. Immigration Judges (“IJ’s”) have over the past decade and more have expressed gratitude \nto SJC staff attorneys for the efficiency our providers bring to their dockets, which are often \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 117\n\n(142 of 348), Page 142 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 142 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nexpedited, and caseload management.  It is not uncommon for the EOIR based in San \nFrancisco, Concord and Sacramento to make referrals of minors to SJC’s intake team. \nMany IJs appreciate our work product because we are known for bringing cases fully \nprepared for trial, well developed, and often fully documented.  We have often been able \nto engage in stipulations with government counsel to avoid unnecessary continuances and \nappeals especially for minors. \n15. Our organization repeatedly earns praise from the California State Bar, as we are an IOLTA \nfunded legal service provider.  We are also regularly praised by the California Department \nof Social Services who has continuously renewed contractual awards with SJC since 2015. \nWe recently have been praised for maintained a shared vision centered on program \nassessment, we advance diversity and inclusion, we emphasize excellence, achieve goals, \nfoster communication, engage staff at all levels, and ensure proper training and resource \nmanagement. SJC exhibits a strong client-centered delivery system with programming \naligned to our vision and funding requirements. We also demonstrate cultural competence \nthrough understanding of diverse community needs and histories, effectively engage with \neligible  populations,  and  establish  appropriate  partnerships  with  government  and \ncommunity organizations. \n16. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025. \n \n17. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 118\n\n(143 of 348), Page 143 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 143 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n18.  We learned of the contract cancellation through an email from a statement put out by Jojo \nAnnobil, the CEO of Immigrant Justice Corps. \n19. The terminated funding accounts for roughly 8% of our organization’s total budget.  SJC \nhad been funded to represent roughly 45 unaccompanied minors per year under CLIN 2. \nThe staff affected would be three IJC fellows.  If we had to lose this funding and there was \nno new funding to be secured, we would be forced to lay off these fellows ASAP because \nwe do not have operating budget to sustain their work.  We have not yet secured any \nadditional or new funding to secure these fellows.  \n20. The funding loss is a huge blow to our immigrant communities and morale of staff.  We \nhave been fortunate enough to survive almost a decade and a half without a single layoff \nand yet this could be our first.  \n21. For example, the SJC cases of Y, JS, and MHC represent particularly compelling scenarios \nfor continued IJC funding support. All three individuals are currently not in active removal \nproceedings. Each presents strong affirmative relief claims requiring immediate legal \nintervention—specifically through asylum and SIJS pathways—demonstrating clear harm \nif representation were terminated. Financial barriers are insurmountable for all three cases: \nY's family faces demonstrable poverty alone, JS as a dependent high school student has no \nincome  source,  and  MHC's  family  lacks  financial  means  for  private  representation. \nCritically, none of these clients have any alleged gang affiliations or criminal history. \nFurthermore,  each  client  has  been  released  to  documented  sponsors  with  lawful \nimmigration status—Y to a U.S. resident sponsor with a Social Security number, JS to a \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 119\n\n(144 of 348), Page 144 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 144 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nsponsor with asylum-based residency, and MHC to a sponsor with SIJS-based residency—\nall people with valid legal status. Without sustained IJC funding, these vulnerable youth \nwith  strong  relief  eligibility  would  face  the  complex  immigration  processes  without \ncounsel, dramatically reducing their likelihood of securing protection despite qualifying \nunder established legal criteria. \n22. In the face of these layoffs, we may be forced to try and refer out the clients such as the \nones described above who were previously represented by our IJC fellows. However,  we \nknow that all organizations doing this work are overly burdened and many cannot take new \ncases.  As noted above, all providers are overburdened.  Thus, it is highly unclear whether \nwe would be successful in referring out our affected clients.  \n23. If we are unsuccessful in referring these clients to other organizations, then we believe \nunder California law and relevant legal ethics that we would be forced to continue \nrepresentation of clients without ORR funding. This would lead to further depletion of \nlimited resources. This patently hurts staff morale, especially when our other staff are \nalready working at and above their full capacity. Trying to competently represent affected \nclients without sufficient funding will likely lead to burn-out and result in other staff \nresigning or leaving for other jobs, thereby further harming our organization and the clients.  \n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the Laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct.  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Berkeley, California, United States.     \n              \n_______________________________  \nGautam Jagannath, Esq. \nExecutive Director \nSOCIAL JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE \n1832 Second Street \nBerkeley, CA 94710 \n(p) 510.992.3964 \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 120\n\n(145 of 348), Page 145 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 145 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF LISA KOOP (NIJC) \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nIN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \n \nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY \nPlaintiffs, \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND \nv.

The mission of NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project \nis to educate children about the United States immigration legal system and assess their \nclaims for legal relief, including asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, and protection \nfrom human trafficking. The Children’s Protection Project equips children to make \ninformed decisions about how to proceed with their immigration cases and represents \nchildren in applications for immigration benefits and in their removal proceedings before \nthe immigration courts.    \n \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project has several main \nwork components: (1) Providing educational services in the form of legal education \n“Know Your Rights” (“KYR”) presentations and conducting individual consultations \nwith unrepresented children in ORR custody in Illinois and Indiana; (2) Representing \nunaccompanied minors who are not in ORR custody in immigration and related \nproceedings; and (3) Representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. \nNIJC hosts Immigrant Justice Corps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren in removal proceedings and provides Spanish-language support for staff \nrepresenting unaccompanied children. \n \n4.  NIJC has provided legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children since its \ninception more than 40 years ago. More than 15 years ago, NIJC began receiving funding \nfrom the federal government to provide KYRs and legal consultations to children in ORR \ncustody. NIJC’s contract to serve immigrant children expanded several times to allow for \na broader range of services to a larger number of children. NIJC is funded by the federal \ngovernment to provide legal services, including KYRs, consultations, and representation \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 122\n\n(147 of 348), Page 147 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 147 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nto children in ORR custody and children outside of ORR custody, who were previously \ndetained. The funds are administered by the Acacia Center for Justice.  \n \n5.  At present, NIJC serves children detained by the federal government in 11 facilities in \nIllinois and Indiana, which together have capacity for 431 children on any given day. \nNIJC serves a combined annual number of around 2,300 children. NIJC provides KYRs \nand legal screenings to around 1,800 children in ORR custody, initiates representation \nwith about 100 detained children, and maintains a caseload of around 500 children who \nare released from ORR custody and continue in their applications for relief and in \nremoval proceedings. \n \n6.  With United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, NIJC \nemploys about 42 staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied \nimmigrant children. Specifically, to do this work, NIJC employs one director partially on \nthis funding, one managing attorney fully on this funding, one program manager fully on \nthis funding, four legal supervisors fully on this funding, three legal supervisors partially \non this funding, nine staff attorneys fully on this funding, seven fellows fully on this \nfunding, one coordinator partially on this funding, 13 paralegals fully on this funding, and \ntwo paralegals partially on this funding.  \n \n7.  NIJC staff members providing KYR presentations, consultations, and representation to \nchildren in ORR facilities regularly travel to each facility to provide in-person legal \neducation, offer legal consultations, conduct client interviews, and prepare clients for \nhearings. NIJC visits each ORR facility once or twice each week. NIJC legal workers \nmeet with recently arrived children who need KYRs and legal screenings, meet with \nchildren who are seeking additional information about legal proceedings, and meet with \nchildren who are NIJC clients for client counseling and case preparation.   \n \n8.  NIJC represents children seeking various forms of immigration relief and protection from \ndeportation including asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, T-visas for survivors of \nhuman trafficking, temporary protected status, and family-based petitions. NIJC \nrepresents children before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the \nimmigration courts, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and state courts. Where \nappropriate, NIJC advocates for the release of children from ORR custody or for transfer \nbetween ORR programs. If NIJC’s clients are transferred to adult detention and held by \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), NIJC may represent clients in bond \nhearings and in seeking relief from removal while in ICE detention.  \n \n9.  NIJC’s next scheduled court hearing for an unaccompanied child client is on April 2, \n2025. NIJC has at least eight immigration court hearings and two state court hearings for \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 123\n\n(148 of 348), Page 148 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 148 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nchild clients in April. While NIJC expects to attend the hearings in April, NIJC’s ability \nto do so in May and beyond is in jeopardy because of the contract termination and the \ncancellation of funding to serve this population.  \n \n10. Children served by NIJC in ORR custody are particularly vulnerable. Many experienced \npersecution by the governments in their home countries or by agents their governments \nare unwilling or unable to control. Many children experienced abandonment, abuse, and \nneglect by one or both of their parents. Some children served by NIJC are survivors of \nhuman trafficking. NIJC frequently serves children considered to be of tender age, \nbecause they are younger than 13 years old. NIJC serves many children who speak rare \nlanguages, meaning not Spanish or English. NIJC staff members are trained to provide \nlegal education and legal services through interpreters to reach these children.  \n \n11. Without NIJC services, it is highly unlikely children in ORR custody in NIJC’s service \narea will receive legal services. Most children served by NIJC are indigent and cannot \npay private attorneys to represent them. Pro bono resources for children in ORR custody \nare scant. Children who are unable to pay a private attorney or connect with a nonprofit \norganization like NIJC face deportation proceedings on their own, without an attorney. \nFor most children, the task of presenting a claim for relief from removal on their own is \ninsurmountable and they are denied the opportunity to present their cases, are denied due \nprocess, and are likely to be ordered deported.  \n \n12. For example, NIJC representation is critical to clients like eight-year-old Juan,1 who is an \nindigent immigrant child who was released from ORR custody into the care of his United \nStates citizen mother. Juan is not in removal proceedings and has no negative factors in \nhis case. Juan was abandoned by his father and requires attorney representation to \nestablish eligibility for family-based protection through his mother.   \n \n13. NIJC’s work with immigrant children is increasingly critical because in recent weeks, \nICE has increased the rate and speed with which it serves Notices to Appear (NTAs) on \nimmigrant children. Service of the NTA and the filing of the NTA with the immigration \ncourt causes removal proceedings against children to proceed. Under this practice, \nchildren have reduced time to have their cases screened by NIJC, receive case \nassessments, make decisions about how they wish to proceed, file procedural motions to \nposition their cases to proceed before the court, prepare applications for relief, gather \nevidence, and develop legal arguments in support of their claims for relief from removal. \nWithout access to NIJC’s legal services—an inevitable reality given the loss of funding to \ndo this work—children with filed NTAs will be greatly disadvantaged.  \n \n1 NIJC is using a substitute name to project client confidentiality.  \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 124\n\n(149 of 348), Page 149 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 149 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\n \n14. In the event that NIJC is forced to cease representing existing clients, the children NIJC \ncurrently serves will be highly unlikely to find private attorneys or pro bono counsel to \nrepresent them. In NIJC’s experience, pro bono attorneys are usually not willing to accept \nmatters involving immigrant children without training and ongoing support from an \norganization with immigration law expertise, like NIJC.      \n \n15. NIJC’s work on behalf of immigrant children is welcomed by immigration judges. NIJC \nmaintains a strong working relationship with ICE attorneys as well as ORR officials. In \nrecent weeks, as the sustainability of NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project has been \nthreatened, a judge at the Chicago Immigration Court expressed concern that NIJC might \nnot be available to represent children appearing before her court. Judges have stated to \nNIJC attorneys that their representation of children allows the court to proceed in an \nefficient manner; it allows judges to be assured that the children have been screened for \nrelief, counseled about their options, and equipped to make informed decisions as they \nface removal proceedings. Likewise, local shelter providers rely on NIJC to provide \ntimely KYR services to the children in their care and value NIJC’s expertise and \nknowledge in working with unaccompanied children. \n \n16. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the United States Department of \nthe Interior) issued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for \nUnaccompanied Children, effective immediately, which extended to all of our Contract \nLine Numbers (CLINs): 1. KYR presentations and legal services for pro se children in \nORR facilities; 2. Legal representation for unaccompanied children both in ORR custody \nand released from ORR custody, as well as additional tasks to support and report on the \nprovision of legal services; 3. Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent children \nnot covered under other CLINs; and 4. Spanish language interpretation and training for \norganizational staff who work with children. Without elaboration on duration or \nreasoning, the stop work order stated that it would “remain in place until you are notified \notherwise” and was “being implemented due to causes outside of your control and should \nnot be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n \n17. NIJC received notice of the stop work order from the Acacia Center for Justice. NIJC \npromptly informed staff members on the Children’s Protection Project, who were greatly \ndistressed by the news that NIJC’s ability to serve immigrant children had been \ndramatically compromised. The stop work order remained in force for about three days, \nbut the program was briefly reinstated and the stop-work order lifted on the third day.  \n \n18. Then, on March 21, 2025, also without warning, NIJC learned that HHS (through the \nUnited States Department of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 125\n\n(150 of 348), Page 150 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 150 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nAcacia Center for Justice (to which NIJC is a subcontractor) that funds legal services for \nunaccompanied children. This termination took effect the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 CLINs: CLIN 2, Legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-representation services, \nsuch as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows \nwho represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish \nlanguage support for organizational staff who work with children.  \n \n19. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no explanation for the partial termination other than \n“the Government’s convenience.” \n \n20. NIJC received notice of the partial termination from the Acacia Center for Justice. NIJC \npromptly informed staff members on the Children’s Protection Project, who were again \ngreatly distressed by the news that NIJC’s ability to serve immigrant children had been \ndramatically compromised after having previously endured the stop work order. \n \n21. The funding NIJC receives from the federal government to serve immigrant children \namounts to more than four million dollars and comprises more than 25% of NIJC’s \noverall budget. Without this funding, NIJC cannot maintain its staff and will be forced to \nterminate positions. To the extent NIJC is able to transition some staff members from the \nChildren’s Protection Project to other projects at NIJC, NIJC may be able to preserve \nsome jobs, but the funding sources for other projects would require people to shift the \nscope of their work. Other funding streams do not allow for the scope and volume of \nservices NIJC currently provides to immigrant children. Put simply: without this funding, \nchildren in NIJC’s service area will lose their attorneys, will be unable to seek protection \nlike asylum, will be more vulnerable to human trafficking, and will face deportation to \nplaces where they will be harmed.  \n \n22. Even in the limited circumstances where it is possible, shifting staff members from \nNIJC’s Children’s Protection Project to other NIJC projects carries significant costs for \nNIJC. NIJC will lose the ability to fully use the expertise of Children’s Protection Project \nstaff members as some of those staff members are incorporated into other teams and the \nfocus of their work is broadened.  \n \n23. In light of the partial contract termination and ongoing risk to funding for legal services \nfor immigrant children, NIJC has initiated transfers of about five staff members to other \nNIJC projects. NIJC has not re-hired for positions vacated by Children’s Protection \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 126\n\n(151 of 348), Page 151 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 151 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nProject staff members who left NIJC. These adjustments have already compromised the \nability of NIJC to serve immigrant children. NIJC is also undertaking an assessment of \nvacancies in other NIJC teams and likely departures in the coming months to identify \nother ways to keep at least some members of the Children’s Protection Project employed. \nThe Children’s Protection Project has conducted significant restructuring and \nreassignment of cases and other responsibilities to account for these shifts. NIJC’s senior \nmanagement team, including NIJC’s executive director, chief operating officer, director \nof development, and director of legal services, have devoted significant time to \nresponding to the Children’s Protection Project funding crisis. Responding to this \nsituation has prevented NIJC from conducting other work critical to NIJC’s mission.  \n \n24. NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project is a core part of NIJC’s mission and an integral \ncomponent of NIJC’s comprehensive work to protect the rights of immigrants, refugees, \nand asylum seekers. A significant reduction in NIJC’s ability to represent children, as will \noccur if federal funding is not restored, will undermine the mission of NIJC, will deny \nimmigrant children a fair day in court, and compromise decades of work NIJC has \naccomplished for immigrant children.       \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Goshen, Indiana.           \n            \ns/ Lisa Koop                      .  \nLisa Koop, National Director of Legal Services  \nNational Immigrant Justice Center  \n110 E.

I \ncertify under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Laura Nally, and I am the Program Director overseeing the Children’s Program \nat Amica Center for Immigrant Rights (“Amica Center”), formerly known as the Capital \nArea Immigrants’ Rights (“CAIR”) Coalition. Amica Center is a Washington, D.C.-based \nnonprofit legal services organization that strives to ensure equal justice for all indigent \nimmigrant  men,  women,  and  children  at  risk  of  detention  and  deportation  in  the \nWashington,  D.C.  area  and  beyond,  through  providing  pro  bono  legal  services  and \nrepresentation. I am an attorney licensed in Virginia and the District of Columbia and have \nbeen practicing immigration law for more than 15 years. I joined the Children’s Program \nat Amica Center in August 2019.  \n2.  Amica Center operates three main programs: the Detained Adult Program (“DAP”), the \nChildren’s Program (“DUCs” or the “Children’s Program”), and the Immigration Impact \nLab. DUCs’ work specifically focuses on offering legal services and representation to \nunaccompanied immigrant children held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) \nat ORR-subcontracted facilities, including shelter and foster care programs, as well as \nchildren in ORR Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (“ORR URM”) programs in the greater \nWashington, D.C. and Baltimore areas.  \n3.\n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 138\n\n(163 of 348), Page 163 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 163 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 17\n4.  To provide these services, Amica Center’s Children’s Program now has 33 full-time and 4 \npart-time staff members. Specifically, the Children’s Program employs a program director, \ndeputy program director, three managing attorneys, one supervising attorney, five senior \nattorneys, six staff attorneys, one Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) Attorney Fellow, two \ncontract attorneys, two managing paralegals, four senior paralegals, seven paralegals, one \nsenior program associate, and three social services staff members. Several additional \npositions are currently vacant due to challenges hiring qualified attorneys in a climate of \nfunding uncertainty. We rely on funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (“HHS”), distributed to us through the Acacia Center for Justice as sub-contractor, \nto fund over 96% of our program. \n5.  Children’s Program staff work to provide legal support, direct representation, and social \nservices to unaccompanied immigrant children who are currently or have been released \nfrom ORR custody at juvenile facilities in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland. Our \ngoals are to educate children about their rights and their legal options while in ORR \ncustody, ensure that their needs are being met and their rights respected, and to represent \nchildren in pursuing any immigration relief or applications for which they may be eligible. \n6.  This work has two principal work components: (1) providing legally-required “Know Your \nRights” presentations to children held in ORR-subcontracted facilities; conducting age-\nappropriate  and  trauma-informed  one-on-one  legal  screenings  for  eligibility  for \nimmigration relief; referring children reunified outside of our geozone to other legal service \nproviders; and preparing and accompanying all detained unaccompanied children in our \ngeozone to their court appearances; and (2) providing in-house direct legal representation \nto unaccompanied children in immigration court, before federal agencies, and in state court \nto pursue immigration relief and applications, as well as referring cases to and mentoring \npro-bono attorneys.  \n7.  To deliver KYR, legal screening, and other non-representational services, Amica Center \nstaff travel in person to each ORR-subcontracted facility on a weekly basis. In calendar \nyear 2024, we provided “Know Your Rights” trainings and intakes to nearly 1,600 children \nin more than 20 languages. In 2023, our team developed a specialized KYR presentation \nusing cartoon animals to provide age-appropriate services to tender age (under 12) children. \nAmica Center utilizes a weekly visit model to ensure that all children receive these initial \nservices within 10 days of their arrival in ORR custody. Depending on the children’s \nlanguage needs, multiple Know Your Rights presentations may be provided on any given \nday. Most children do not understand why they are being held in government custody, that \nthey will be placed in removal proceedings, or that legal protections exist for children under \nU.S. immigration law. Our staff are trained not only to break down complex information \nand topics in  age- and culturally-appropriate ways, but to utilize active engagement \nstrategies to ensure that children are fully engaged and focused on the material and able to \nask questions. Children then immediately receive a legal screening with a staff member \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 139\n\n(164 of 348), Page 164 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 164 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 17\ntrained in trauma-informed and child-friendly interviewing. It is not uncommon for a legal \nscreening to take place over multiple meetings if a child is too emotionally overwhelmed \nto tell their story or needs time to build trust before recounting traumatic events.  \n8.  The Children’s Program also provides a crucial suite of nonrepresentational services \nincluding court preparation, courtroom assistance and accompaniment, and legal referrals. \nWhen  a  child  in  an  ORR-subcontracted  facility  is  scheduled  for  an  appearance  in \nimmigration court, we meet individually with the child to explain what to expect in court \nand then appear alongside the child as “Friend of the Court” to share information and \nupdates with the immigration court such as the child’s expected reunification location. We \nalso help children with matters related to their placement and rights within the ORR system. \nWhen a child is expected to remain in ORR custody until their 18th birthday, we have \nassisted the ORR-subcontracted facility staff to identify suitable post-18 placements such \nas transitional housing programs for young adults and liaised with the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) Field Office Juvenile Coordinator to advocate for the \nchild’s release to a community-based program rather than transfer to ICE detention. When \nwe identify a child to be a potential victim of trafficking, we refer them to the Office on \nTrafficking in Persons (“OTIP”) for a determination of eligibility for benefits and services \nunder federal law.  \n9.  Amica Center staff offer full legal representation to children in the ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities we serve who do not have a viable ORR sponsor, who are placed into an LTFC \nprogram, who wish to return to their home countries, whose immigration proceedings \nadvance to a point where they are expected to make substantive decisions about their legal \ncase, and who are confirmed to be reunifying into our geozone to ensure continuity of legal \nservices. We also initiate representation for particularly vulnerable children, including \nvictims of trafficking, children who have experienced abuse or neglect in custody, or \nchildren who have been placed in restrictive settings or out-of-network placements.  \n10.  Between March 30, 2024, and March 20, 2025, we initiated representation with 192 \nchildren in ORR-subcontracted facilities and ORR URM programs. Children’s Program \nattorneys represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings before the Hyattsville, \nBaltimore, Annandale, and Sterling Immigration Courts and the Board of Immigration \nAppeals (“BIA”). DUCs staff also represent children in applications with U.S. Citizen and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) including asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status \n(“SIJS”), family-based and humanitarian (U and T) visas, Temporary Protected Status \n(“TPS”) and self-petitions under the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”). In addition \nto providing direct legal services, Amica Center staff also work to recruit, train, and \nsupervise  teams  of  pro  bono  attorneys  who  represent  unaccompanied  children  in \nimmigration proceedings and applications for immigration status. These pro bono attorneys \nare a critical part of Amica Center’s mission and model which allows us to leverage \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 140\n\n(165 of 348), Page 165 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 165 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 17\nvolunteer legal services to more efficiently represent children. Approximately 15% of cases \ncurrently open with the Children’s Program are placed with pro bono attorneys. \n11.  Amica Center’s Children’s Program has continuously received HHS funding since 2015. \nWe currently have more than 850 open cases that were initiated and continuously funded \nthrough HHS funding. Children released to sponsors or transitional living programs live \nthroughout the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas, including in the \nsuburbs of Virginia and Maryland. Specific bar licensure is required to represent children \nin SIJS cases in each of the three jurisdictions where we practice, and this affects how case \nassignments are made among our attorneys. Due to the significant backlogs in state courts, \nUSCIS, and the immigration courts, children’s immigration cases often take years to \nresolve before an eligible child is granted asylum, a U or T visa, or lawful permanent \nresidence.  \n12.  The need for legal representation and other support services for unaccompanied children—\nespecially those in government custody and those facing deportation—is truly critical. \nImmigration law and procedures are incredibly complex and becoming more so every day. \nThe  overwhelming  majority  of  unaccompanied  children  that  we  encounter  in  ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities do not have the means to pay for a qualified private immigration \nattorney to represent them. ORR-subcontracted facilities are often located in rural areas \nwhere  there  are  limited  or  no  pro  bono  resources.  For  example,  one  of  the  ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities that we serve is located approximately two hours away from \nWashington, D.C., the closest metropolitan area, by car and far from any other potential \nservice providers. \n13.\n14.  In our experience, other government stakeholders including immigration judges, ORR-\nsubcontracted facility staff, and the DHS Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”) \nattorneys also prefer and appreciate when an unaccompanied child is represented by \ncounsel. We frequently appear as Friend of Court to relay important updates regarding a \nchild’s reunification to OPLA and the immigration court and to coordinate appropriate \nchanges of address and changes of venue. ORR-subcontracted facility staff often have \nquestions for us about the logistics for children’s appearances in court. Immigration judges \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 141\n\n(166 of 348), Page 166 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 166 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 17\nhave sometimes requested that we enter appearances for children if the judge has doubts \nabout the child’s competency or understanding of their legal options. We also play a critical \nrole in identifying and referring children for appointment of a Child Advocate. For children \nwho are reunifying outside of our geozone, we provide legal referrals, either directly to \nanother Acacia Center network provider or by providing a list of potential pro bono or low-\ncost resources directly to the child and sponsor. Because capacity for free and low-cost \nrepresentation is overstretched in most areas, however, these resources can be very difficult \nto access. \n15.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a Stop Work Order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, effective \nimmediately,  which  extended  to  “all  activities”  under  the  contract. Attached  hereto \nas Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the Stop Work Order, dated February 18, 2025. \nWithout further elaboration as to duration or reasoning, the Stop Work Order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” Ex. 1 at 1. HHS then rescinded the Stop Work Order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of the Stop Work \nOrder Recission, dated February 21, 2025. \n16.  The chilling effect of the February Stop Work Order has had lasting effects on the \nChildren’s Program. Two staff members, including one Senior Paralegal and one IJC \nAttorney Fellow, have accepted employment with private immigration firms and cited as \nthe deciding factor the job insecurity generated by doubts about the security of our HHS \nfunding. This climate of uncertainty has also had a chilling effect on hiring qualified \nattorney candidates to fill existing vacancies, which in turn increases the caseloads of \nexisting staff and has a negative effect on morale and retention.  \n17.\n18.  Our program was notified of the Partial Termination via an email from the Acacia Center \nfor Justice shortly after 11 AM on March 21. We called a teamwide meeting several minutes \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 142\n\n(167 of 348), Page 167 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 167 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 17\nlater to share the news with staff and answer their questions. Although our staff are \nunderstandably  concerned  about  their  job  security  and  their  ability  to  obtain  future \nemployment due to the sweeping expanse of the cuts to funded legal representation for \nchildren, their overwhelming response was to look for solutions for how to continue to \nrepresent the clients who trust and rely on us for their legal cases.  \n19.  The abrupt termination of CLIN 2 funding for representation and associated services \nrepresents a loss of approximately 30% of Amica Center’s total annual budget and 75% of \nthe budget for the Children’s Program. Amica Center has not yet set a timeline by which \ndecisions would need to be made regarding staff layoffs or the discontinuation of any major \naspects of our work. However, all work on cases where representation was undertaken \nduring the preceding 10 years of HHS funding through the Acacia Center for Justice is now \nbeing funded using general operating funds. The organization has taken this position due \nto our ongoing ethical obligations to our clients and to preserve our ability to continue \nproviding high-quality representation to those clients by minimizing the loss of qualified \nstaff  members. Amica  Center  cannot  continue  to  fund  this  casework  using  general \noperating funds indefinitely. We are urgently seeking funding from other sources, but the \ncollective impact of a nationwide shutdown is so great that the gap cannot be filled by \nprivate donors. To the extent that cases initiated under HHS funding could be transferred \nto funding streams held by other Amica Center programs (for example, state or local \nfunding currently being used for adult representation), this would interfere with Amica \nCenter’s mission to maximize representation for indigent immigration men, women, and \nchildren at risk for detention and deportation by directly supplanting the organization’s \nability to represent other affected individuals. \n20.  The alternative—to immediately withdraw from representation in our 850 affected cases—\nis antithetical to our ethical obligations as attorneys and our values as a mission-driven \norganization. In many of the open legal cases for our child clients, there are upcoming \nhearings or deadlines which mean that withdrawing from the case would not be possible. \nAcross the Children’s Program, we have six clients scheduled for hearings with local \nimmigration courts between March 24 and March 27. Not only is it nearly logistically \nimpossible to withdraw from an immigration matter in that time frame, since withdrawal \nrequires leave of the immigration judge, it is also impossible to do so without prejudicing \nthe client’s legal interests. We have dozens of open matters pending with state courts for \nchildren who are eligible for SIJS. In addition to upcoming hearings, there are ongoing \ntime-sensitive legal requirements in those cases, including service of process on opposing \nparties, requests for orders of default, and other procedural requirements that, if not timely \ncompleted, could lead to dismissal or significant delay. Pro bono attorneys are heavily \nreliant on mentorship from experienced in-house immigration attorneys and at risk of \ncommitting errors or omissions in their cases without mentorship.  \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 143\n\n(168 of 348), Page 168 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 168 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 17\n21.  Although KYR presentations and legal screenings remain funded for now through CLIN \n1, significant, interrelated pieces of our work have been terminated, the consequences of \nwhich are immediate and severe. For example, if a child at one of the ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal need such as an outstanding \nremoval  order,  Amica  Center—the  only  legal  provider  with  access  to  the  ORR-\nsubcontracted facility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to \nprotect the child from imminent removal. Many children who enter ORR custody with prior \nremoval orders are eligible to have their immigration court proceedings reopened, but \ndoing so requires filing a motion as quickly as possible, something which children simply \ncannot do without the help of an experienced attorney. Similarly, without timely access to \ncompetent legal services, older children are at risk of losing access to protections based on \ntheir age. A 17-year-11-month-old child who has been severely abused by their parent(s), \nfor example, is eligible under federal law to petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status \nuntil age 21. In Virginia, however, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations (“JDR”) court, \nmust make the necessary findings of fact regarding eligibility, must obtain jurisdiction \nbefore the child turns 18. Without access to legal representation who can initiate the \nnecessary proceedings before the child’s 18th birthday, that child’s right and ability to seek \nprotection through SIJS is functionally eliminated.  \n22.  One of the children currently represented by the Children’s Program is a four-year-old boy \nfrom Haiti, referred to here as “Jean.” He is currently in an ORR URM program living with \nfoster parents in Virginia. Jean entered the United States shortly after he turned three years \nold and was placed in ORR custody. After it was determined that there were no viable \nsponsors for him in the United States, Jean was released from custody to an ORR URM \nprogram served by Amica Center. Amica Center coordinated with the HHS-funded legal \nprovider which had been working with him at his ORR placement to transfer his legal case \nand  substitute  counsel  on  all  of  his  pending  matters  to  avoid  an  interruption  in \nrepresentation. Jean has a TPS application pending, is eligible for SIJS and is in removal \nproceedings. SIJS findings for Jean would be made through his open foster care proceeding \nin Virginia, and he is scheduled for a hearing on April 2, 2025. His Amica Center attorney \nhas been working to prepare the necessary motion and proposed order in advance to ensure \nthat the matter can be heard at the upcoming hearing. Jean is also scheduled for a Master \nCalendar Hearing in early June at which it is obvious that he could neither engage with the \nproceeding nor provide relevant updates to the court regarding his other pending legal \nmatters to the court other than through counsel. \n23.  The  interruption  and  subsequent  termination  of  funding  for  representation  and \nnonrepresentational services to unaccompanied children has already frustrated Amica \nCenter’s mission and threatened the sustainability of our work. Providing a legal screening \nwithout the ability to refer a child for long-term representation, connect them to benefits \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 144\n\n(169 of 348), Page 169 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 169 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 17\nand  services  for  victims  of  trafficking,  or  prepare  and  accompany  them  to  court, \nfundamentally restricts the efficacy of that legal orientation and screening.  \n24.\n25.  If the Children’s Program were forced to lay off staff due to sudden and unexpected \ntermination of funding, it would be a drain on our organizational expertise in the delivery \nof legal representation and other services to the unaccompanied immigrant children held \nin ORR custody. The collective experience of our specialized staff would be nearly \nimpossible to recover and would hobble our ability to deliver high-quality services to \nunaccompanied children in ORR custody in the Capital region, even if funding were \nrestored to similar levels in the future. The level of investment required to hire and train \nnew staff, fellows, volunteers, or interns would divert significant director and manager time \nand resources from the continued provision of representation to existing clients and have a \nlasting impact on the morale and retention of supervisors and managers. My own time over \nthe past month has been overwhelmingly diverted from essential case supervision and legal \nguidance in a rapidly changing area of immigration practice, to responding to threats to our \nfunding and program stability.  \n26.  The continued funding of this work is critical to ensuring that children do not experience \nirreparable harm to their ability to access legal protections in the United States. Children \nwho have spent months and years building trust and rapport with an attorney or legal \nadvocate will be faced with the prospect of navigating a complicated and increasingly \nhostile legal system alone or urgently seeking out either the few remaining low-cost \nresources for representation in this space or the resources to pay for private counsel, \nreliving and recounting some of their most personal and traumatic experiences with a \nstranger.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25 of March 2025, in Alexandria, Virginia.  \n                          \n8 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 145\n\n(170 of 348), Page 170 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 170 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 17\n_______________________________  \nDirector, Detained Children’s Program  \nAmica Center for Immigrant Rights \n1025 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 701 \nWashington, D.C. 20036            \nP: (202) 916-8179 \nlaura@amicacenter.org \n \n9 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 146\n\n(171 of 348), Page 171 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 171 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 17\n \nExhibit \n1  \n\n(172 of 348), Page 172 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 172 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 17\nStay Motion Addendum 148\n\n(173 of 348), Page 173 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 173 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 17\n \nExhibit \n2  \n\n(174 of 348), Page 174 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 174 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 17\n \nStay Motion Addendum 150\n\n(175 of 348), Page 175 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 175 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 17\n \nExhibit \n3  \nStay Motion Addendum 151\n\n(176 of 348), Page 176 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 176 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 17\n   \nUnited States Department of the Interior \nINTERIOR BUSINESS CENTER \nWashington, DC 20240   \n \n \n \n \nMarch 25, 2025 \n \nTo:    \n    Acacia Center for Justice \n1025 Connecticut Avenue NW \nSuite 1000A \nWashington, DC 20036 \n \nSubject:   Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience \n \nContract 140D0422C0009, awarded on March 29, 2022, by the United States Department of the \nInterior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families \n(ACF), Office Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as a part of our Interagency Agreement for acquisition \nservices, is hereby partially terminated for the Government’s convenience.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true \nand correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Martha Ruch, and I am the Lead Managing Attorney of the Immigration \nProgram at Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”). I have been an \nimmigration attorney with CLSEPA for five and a half years, since September 2019. \nCLSEPA is a non-profit legal aid organization that serves residents of San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California. CLSEPA has offices in the city of East Palo Alto, San \nFrancisco, and Mountain View. CLSEPA is one of the primary organizations dedicated to \nproviding free immigration legal services to low-income immigrants in San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California, including indigent unaccompanied immigrant children \nwho are residing with sponsors in the San Francisco Bay Area after their release from \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody.  \n2.  CLSEPA is a legal aid organization with immigration, housing, and economic advancement \nlegal services. Our economic advancement work includes post-conviction relief, re-entry \nwork, workers’ rights, and consumer protection law. CLSEPA’s mission is to deliver \ntransformative legal services, empower communities, and help community members in \nEast Palo Alto, San Mateo County, and Santa Clara County achieve a secure and thriving \nfuture.  CLSEPA’s  immigration  practice  is  unique  among  immigration  legal  service \norganizations in that we handle both adult and children’s cases, as well as both defensive \ncases in deportation proceedings before the immigration court, and affirmative applications \nfor humanitarian or family-based visas from the immigration benefits agency, United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). CLSEPA tries to prioritize vulnerable \nclients for immigration representation, as well as clients who would be unable to afford \nlegal representation elsewhere. \n3.  In order to carry out its mission, CLSEPA represents unaccompanied minors in removal \nproceedings in immigration court after they are released from ORR custody to sponsors \nliving in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. As a major part of this work, we represent \nunaccompanied immigrant children who are in foster care and who are receiving social \nwork  services  from  another  organization,  Catholic  Charities  of  Santa  Clara  County \n(“CCSCC”).

CLSEPA has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nCalifornia since 2014. CLSEPA began assisting unaccompanied immigrant children in \nremoval proceedings as part of Bay Area removal defense collaboratives and expanded our \nwork to include removal defense for immigrant children immediately following their \nrelease from ORR detention. CLSEPA currently represents about 50 children who are either \nin removal proceedings, or who we previously represented in removal proceedings. We \ncontinue to assist with affirmative applications for immigration status even after the \nconclusion of a child’s case in immigration court. Of these children, 23 are living in foster \ncare and were referred to CLSEPA for representation in their removal proceedings once \nthey were released from ORR detention into the custody of legal guardians. Most of our \nunaccompanied child clients are either based in Santa Clara or have ties there, either \nbecause they reside with their legal guardians in Santa Clara County, or their case workers \nare located there through CCSCC. \n5.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, CLSEPA employs \nsix staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren. For all six staff members, representation of unaccompanied children makes up a \nsignificant portion of their case work. Specifically, three attorneys work on unaccompanied \nminors’  removal  defense  cases  in  immigration  court  and  each  represent  five  to  ten \nimmigrant children who were released from ORR custody into foster care. Three non-\nattorney paralegals assist CLSEPA’s immigration attorneys in the representation of our \nyouth and child clients. \n6.  CLSEPA’s work with unaccompanied minors only extends to legal representation after the \nchild’s release from ORR custody. We represent children in ongoing immigration cases in \nnon-detained  immigration  court,  or  in  applications  before  USCIS.  Staff  providing \nrepresentation to unaccompanied minors make every effort we can to meet with our clients \nin person and provide culturally appropriate and child-sensitive services. Staff travel to \ndifferent parts of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area to meet with clients, and work in \ncollaboration with clients’ guardians and social workers to conduct appointments and \nprepare applications for immigration benefits. CLSEPA represents children in removal \nproceedings in immigration court, affirmative relief like asylum before USCIS, Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) in state court, and humanitarian visas like the T visa, \nU visa, or VAWA. \n7.  CLSEPA has represented 25 children through HHS’s Legal Services for Unaccompanied \nChildren  program  since  2022.  These  25  children  all  came  to  the  United  States  as \nunaccompanied immigrant children, and the majority live in foster care. Two of CLSEPA’s \nclients whom we served through HHS funding were children from Afghanistan who were \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 156\n\n(181 of 348), Page 181 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 181 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 6\ngranted  asylum  before  USCIS  and  have  already  been  granted  permanent  residency. \nCLSEPA remains the attorney of record for the remaining 23 of our child immigrant clients \nwhom we retained through HHS funding. \n8.  In our representation of unaccompanied minors in immigration court, CLSEPA has had a \npositive interaction with immigration judges and has been successful in negotiating with \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) to dismiss or terminate many clients’ \nremoval proceedings. CLSEPA is proactive about filing applications for immigration status \nas soon as possible and contacts opposing counsel from ICE in advance of all clients’ \nscheduled hearings in immigration court to ensure that clients can move forward with their \nimmigration cases without needing to miss school or appear in person at their hearings. Of \nthe 25 children who CLSEPA has represented in their immigration cases under the HHS \nUnaccompanied Children Program, none are currently in active removal proceedings. All \nclients’ removal defense cases have either been terminated, dismissed, were never filed \nwith the immigration court, or are administratively closed while awaiting a decision from \nUSCIS on an application for immigration benefits. \n9.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all four Contract Line Numbers (“CLINs”). \nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. \n \n10. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation services, such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds attorneys \nplaced through the Attorney Recruitment Project and Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who \nrepresent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish \nlanguage tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. For the time being, HHS \nhas left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal \nconsultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial termination, HHS ordered \nAcacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS \nprovided  no  justification  for  the  partial  termination  other  than  “the  Government’s \nconvenience.”  \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 157\n\n(182 of 348), Page 182 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 182 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 6\n11. CLSEPA found out about the termination of the HHS contract for unaccompanied children \non the morning of Friday, March 21, through an email from the Acacia Center for Justice. \nOur staff was already working on our clients’ cases as usual and received receipt notices \nfor some of our HHS-funded clients’ immigration cases in the mail that same day. CLSEPA \ncontinued to advise and update our child clients about their cases, as required by our ethical \nobligations as attorneys and pursuant to the California Rules of Professional Responsibility.  \n12. If our HHS funding to represent unaccompanied minors in their immigration cases is \nterminated for good, CLSEPA will need to find another source of funding to continue \nrepresenting our clients. CLSEPA intends to continue representing our clients in their \naffirmative immigration applications with USCIS and in their administratively closed \nremoval proceedings in removal court. We will follow through on our commitment to re-\ncalendar and terminate clients’ administratively closed removal proceedings when they are \neligible and will continue to renew the employment authorization for clients who have \npending asylum applications or approved SIJS status. For our clients who have SIJS status \nand are in the visa backlog with their applications for permanent residency, CLSEPA \nunfortunately may need to re-evaluate our signed contracts to determine whether we can \nstill guarantee representation once their priority date becomes current to adjust their status. \nAll 23 of our current child clients have approved SIJS status and are waiting for their \nopportunity to apply for permanent residency, but CLSEPA may no longer be able to assist \nthem without continued funding. \n13. CLSEPA’s funding from HHS to represent unaccompanied children in their immigration \ncases is one of our primary sources of funding for our immigration work. It currently \ncomprises about 15% of our immigration direct services budget. The three attorneys and \nthree support staff who work on this grant will need to do additional work to evaluate the \nnext steps on our children’s cases and determine whether we can continue to meet our \nobligations in their cases. CLSEPA will not be able to hire or train new staff as anticipated \nin order to continue this important work. CLSEPA may be able to assign our cases to other \nlocal, county, or state grants but this will vary depending on each child’s current location \nand case circumstances. Even if we are able to reassign our cases to other grants, it will \ncreate a burden on our staff and will mean that we are unable to take on new clients using \nthose already assigned funds. \n14. The contract termination creates a serious impact on CLSEPA’s mission and our ability to \nfulfill our ethical obligations to our clients. Unaccompanied immigrant children represent \nsome of our most vulnerable clients, especially those living in foster care. Most of these \nclients have approved SIJS status but need ongoing advice and renewals of immigration \nbenefits in order to maintain stability and participate in civic life in the United States. For \nclients in administratively closed removal proceedings, the process of substituting or \nwithdrawing counsel may prejudice the client or cause them to be placed back into active \nremoval  proceedings.  CLSEPA  intends  to  keep  representing  our  clients  in  removal \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 158\n\n(183 of 348), Page 183 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 183 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 6\nproceedings pursuant to our ethical obligations so that they are not harmed by a change in \ntheir  counsel.  However,  CLSEPA  has  had  grim  conversations  with  our  partner \norganizations to let them know that we may no longer be able to continue accepting \nreferrals for new cases. In particular, we have had to inform CCSCC that we can no longer \nguarantee representation for unaccompanied immigrant children who are placed into foster \ncare after release from ORR custody, even if they are in removal proceedings and have no \ncounsel to appear with them in court. Thus, the negative effects of the partial contract \ntermination are being felt beyond CLSEPA and affect the wider community’s ability to \nprovide services to unaccompanied children in San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, and \nthe Greater Bay Area.  \n15. The uncertainty around HHS funding and contract termination has also had a negative \nimpact on CLSEPA’s ability to hire and train new staff. This has in turn aggravated staff \nburnout. This burnout and overburdening of our remaining staff will continue to have a \nnegative impact over time if CLSEPA is unable to bring new attorneys into the team after \nstaff turnover.  While CLSEPA seeks new funding so we can represent our clients into the \nfuture, the reality that we may need to withdraw from some cases in the future causes a \nmoral injury to our staff who are dedicated to our clients and their wellbeing. The prospect \nof withdrawing from our clients’ cases is contrary to the sense of trust and safety that we \ntry to instill in our work, especially with our child clients. Furthermore, if our clients lose \ntheir immigration legal advocates, they will be at risk of having their legal status expire or \nof losing the opportunity to apply for permanent residency when they are eligible. Youth \nclients may also fall victim to immigration enforcement or be referred back to removal \nproceedings without ongoing advice from a legal advocate. The termination of this funding \nfor CLSEPA’s most vulnerable clients during a time when immigration enforcement has \nbecome more commonplace and more likely to violate clients’ constitutional rights is a \ndevastating loss for CLSEPA, for our staff, and for the communities we fight for so that \nthey can survive, thrive, and contribute to life here in the United States. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in San Francisco, California         \n              \n_______________________________  \nMartha Ruch \nLead Managing Attorney \nCLSEPA \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 159\n\n(184 of 348), Page 184 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 184 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ELIZABETH \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nSANCHEZ KENNEDY (GHIRP) IN \n \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1. My name is Elizabeth Sanchez Kennedy, and I am the Executive Director at the Galveston-\nHouston Immigrant Representation Project. GHIRP is a legal services organization that\nwas launched in October 2020 with a mission to build a resilient, diverse community by\nproviding comprehensive representation and holistic legal services to immigrants in need.\nGHIRP’s legal services range from outreach and education to complex litigation in the\nGalveston-Houston  area.  Our  legal  team  provides  holistic  and  comprehensive\nrepresentation to immigrants in the community, including unaccompanied minors, adults,\nand women, children, and families.\n3. GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & Youth program is dedicated to representing indigent\nunaccompanied immigrant children who are not in detention as well as those held in Office\nof Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody throughout the Galveston-Houston area. This\nprogram was directly impacted by the termination of funds dedicated to unaccompanied\nimmigrant  children.  Core  to  GHIRP’s  mission  and  legal  services,  is  providing\nrepresentation to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth. GHIRP was founded with\nfunding for unaccompanied immigrant children and our first year of services focused\nalmost exclusively on legal services for detained and released unaccompanied immigrant\nchildren.  The contract termination, which cuts funding dedicated to one of our main legal\nservices, perceptibly impairs our core business activities.\n4. In order to carry out our mission, GHIRP has several main work components: (1) providing\neducational and pro se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” (KYR)\npresentations,  conducting  individual  consultations  (intakes),  and  conducting  pro  se\nservices with unrepresented children in ORR custody in the Greater Houston Area; (2)\nrepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration\n1 \nStay Motion Addendum 161\n\n(186 of 348), Page 186 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 186 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\nproceedings; (3) representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings; (4) \nreferring children for pro bono legal services outside of the Galveston-Houston area; and \n(5) providing social services to unaccompanied children. We further host an Immigrant \nJustice Corps (IJC) fellow to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings \nand provide Spanish-language tutoring for staff representing unaccompanied children. \n5.  GHIRP  has  been  providing  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  in \nGalveston  and  Houston  since  2020,  when  the  organization  was  founded.  Since  the \norganization opened, our legal services dedicated to unaccompanied immigrant children \nhave expanded each year.  In 2020, we provided direct representation to approximately 35 \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  In 2021, GHIRP initiated services in a newly opened \nORR facility in Houston (Children's First Residential Care TX Gasmer), providing KYR \npresentations, intakes, direct representation, social services, and referrals for children who \nwere released to other jurisdictions.  In 2023, GHIRP began providing the same legal \nservices to unaccompanied children in a second ORR shelter named LSSS Upbring Krause \nChildren's Center. GHIRP’s direct representation services dedicated to children who are \nnot in custody have also expanded, from 35 cases in our first year of existence (2020) to \nnow serving approximately 300 clients per year (2025).  Currently, GHIRP serves a \ncombined annual number of nearly 1,500 children per year, including approximately 1,500 \nchildren  detained  in  ORR  custody,  approximately  300  children  receiving  direct \nrepresentation services per year, 120-150 children receiving social services per year, and \napproximately 35-50 children receiving pro se assistance per year.  \n6.  Wholly with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, GHIRP has \nhired 19 staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren. Specifically, our team comprises seven (7) attorneys, one (1) Department of \nJustice Accredited Representative, nine (9) legal assistants, and two (2) social services \ncoordinators.  As executive director, I oversee the program, support the managing attorney, \nand provide mentorship to the legal team. All staff on GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & \nYouth team are full time employees, and one of the attorneys is an Immigrant Justice Corps \nfellow. Through this contract, we serve recently arriving children in the ORR facilities, as \nwell as released children in the community.   \n7.  GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & Youth team serves detained children who are between the \nages of six (6) and seventeen (17) years old, and non-detained children of all ages. We \nprovide legal services to children within seven to ten (7-10) business days of their arrival \nto the ORR facilities, if not sooner.   \n8.  GHIRP staff provide detained services in the facilities two to four (2-4) times per week, for \napproximately  two  to  four  (2-4)  hours  or  more  each  visit.  Staff  providing  direct \nrepresentation and KYR presentations to children in ORR facilities regularly travel to each \nfacility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for hearings, gather evidence, \n2 \n \n\n(187 of 348), Page 187 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 187 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\nas well as provide legal education, individual consultations, and pro se legal services. Our \nteam also provides “friend of court” legal services so that children appearing in court \nwithout an attorney do not have to appear alone. The courts function more efficiently when \nlegal  representatives  are  involved  as  “friend  of  court”  as  they  explain  technical \nrequirements at preliminary hearings and move the cases along while protecting their \nrights.  GHIRP’s legal team also advocates for children in ORR custody seeking release or \ntransfers, reporting disclosed physical or sexual abuse while in custody, and ensuring that \ntheir basic needs are met by the facility and staff (such as language access and access to \neducation and recreation). If and when a child is released to a location outside of our \ngeographic area, we refer children for legal services in the location where they are going.  \n9.  The GHIRP legal team is trained to provide child-friendly, trauma-informed, culturally \ncompetent services to tender aged children, as well as pre-teen and teenage children.  When \nwe meet the children for the first time, they can be confused, vulnerable, and they often do \nnot understand the complex immigration system that they must navigate. Many children \ndo not understand where they are, why they are in a shelter, or that they have rights.  \nThrough our KYR presentations we teach them about their rights, the immigration system, \nand what they must to do seek relief in the United States.  We also explain what their \nobligations and rights are after they leave the ORR shelter.  \n10. Our staff teaches children about how to identify harmful behavior by caretakers. The goal \nis to provide complex information to children of all ages in a way that they can comprehend \nand retain.  The GHIRP legal team tailors presentations and individual consultations to \nmeet the needs and capacities of each child. We developed materials and resources specific \nto all age groups so that children remain engaged and empowered by our services. During \nindividual consultations, our staff are trained to meet each child at their developmental \nlevel to ensure that the intake is effective and comprehensive.  We have seen firsthand how \nthis information and engagement in our services is critical to preventing trafficking and \nabuse after minors leave the facility, as well as safeguarding their legal rights in the \nimmigration system.  \n11. The  GHIRP  legal  team  provides  representation  to  detained  children  appearing  in \nimmigration court and those who are released to the Galveston-Houston area.  We identify \nchildren who are eligible for legal relief and assist them in preparing their case from the \ninitial filing of the application or appearance in court, to the finality of their case.  We \nrepresent  children  in  matters  before  the  Houston  immigration  courts,  the  Board  of \nImmigration Appeals, federal district courts and petitions for review in circuit courts, as \nwell as children seeking affirmative relief before USCIS and the USCIS Houston Asylum \nOffice, and family court petitions in state court. Our legal team represents children seeking \nhumanitarian relief such as asylum, U-visa and T-visa applications, Special Immigrant \nJuvenile visa petitions, and VAWA petitions.  GHIRP conducts pro se workshops for \nchildren who qualify for legal relief but cannot obtain an attorney to represent them. \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 163\n\n(188 of 348), Page 188 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 188 of 348\n12. Many children that receive our legal services do not speak English, have experienced \ntrauma, and do not have the resources to hire an attorney. Some clients are so young they \ncannot read or write in their own language, much less present a legally sufficient case in \nEnglish in an adversarial court system.  We have represented non-verbal children, children \nwith mental and physical disabilities, and parenting children who have been sexually \nabused from a young age.  Given their particular vulnerabilities, many of our young clients \ndo not have the resources to hire a private attorney and they cannot present a legally \nsufficient case before the court without an attorney by their side. GHIRP’s free, accessible \nrepresentation is their only chance to meaningfully participate in their case and obtain a \nfair outcome. \n13. GHIRP attorneys regularly appear before juvenile docket Immigration Judges for our \nclients that are unaccompanied immigrant children.  The attorneys are knowledgeable \nabout legal issues specific to immigrant children and understand the preferences of the \njudges including required motions and evidence to be filed before hearings. This familiarity \nwith the juvenile judges and issues ensures efficient adjudication of cases, or dismissals of \nremoval proceedings where relief is available outside of the court. By frequently appearing \nwith children in the courts, GHIRP attorneys are able to effectively prepare our child clients \nfor hearings, eliminating the stress and trauma of appearing before an Immigration Judge.  \n14. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation to GHIRP on February \n21, 2025. \n \n15. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, GHIRP learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice (to which our organization is a subcontractor) that funds GHIRP’s legal services for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Item Numbers \n(CLINs): CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 164\n\n(189 of 348), Page 189 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 189 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n16.  I received notification of the contract termination by email. I notified the Immigrant \nChildren & Youth team that the contract was terminated effective immediately, and that \nwork on cases under the contract should stop due to a lack of funding. As a team, we \nassessed our cases that are currently in progress, our clients’ reliance on our representation, \nimmediate next steps for clients, and work that needed to be prioritized given the time-\nsensitive nature of the cases.    \n17. Notification of the contract termination has significantly impacted our organization, staff, \nand clients. GHIRP currently represents 292 clients with funding from the current contract \nwith Acacia Center for Justice. Our youngest client is two (2) years old. We represent \nclients who have imminent hearings, filing deadlines, and time-sensitive motions before \nthe court.  Our clients are scheduled to appear in court as soon as April 2, 9, and 10, 2025. \nThe April 2, 2025 hearing is for a detained client who needs to file relief and be prepared \nto plead in his second setting in Immigration Court, which has necessitated urgent work to \nprepare an application this week. Another client has an Individual Hearing on April 9, 2025 \nthat will require substantial attorney preparation time, in addition to working closely with \nthe client on his testimony, and another client has a filing deadline for that same day.   \n18. Some cases require complex legal arguments, such as our client who is contesting the \njudge’s jurisdictional decision related to his asylum claim. The law entitles this client to \nexplicit procedural due process protections for unaccompanied children, including filing \nhis asylum application with the asylum office first. Our attorney has filed two separate \nmotions and appeared at a hearing related to this issue and is scheduled to appear again in \ncourt to resolve the matter.  Our young client will not be able to advocate for his rights \nalone if we are forced to abruptly withdraw from his case.   \n19. GHIRP’s IJC Fellow represents “Evelyn,” a 12-year-old girl from Mexico who has endured \nsignificant abuse starting at a very young age.  Before entering the United States, she was \nlabor trafficked at the young age of 5 years old and endured physical and sexual abuse at \nthe hands of her caretakers who were her extended family members. We assisted Evelyn in \nfiling her asylum application and are in the process of gathering documentation and \ninformation to file a T-visa application. These forms of relief will ensure that she can stay \nin the U.S. with her sponsor and heal from her past trafficking and abuse. Evelyn was issued \na Notice to Appear and will soon be required to appear in the Houston Immigration Court. \nTo withdraw from her case at this stage would likely result in her abandoning both forms \nof relief and being forced to return to the very dangers she fled. \n \n20. GHIRP also represents “Rosa,” a 15-year-old girl from Honduras, in her immigration case \nseeking both SIJS and asylum.  When we met Rosa, she was incapable of speaking due to \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 165\n\n(190 of 348), Page 190 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 190 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\nher severe trauma.  She would sit silently with her attorney, picking at her skin and \nrepeating nervous ticks due to her extreme discomfort and anxiety.  Through multiple \nmeetings and building rapport, Rosa disclosed her history of parental abandonment and \nneglect, as well as surviving sexual abuse in her home country. She continues to display \nextensive distress related to her past trauma.  GHIRP filed her asylum application (which \nis currently pending) and her family court case is pending in state court, which forms the \nbasis for an application for SIJS.  Rosa is not capable of complying with family court \nrequirements for service of process, establishing parentage, and meeting the legal standards \nfor the requested proposed order without an attorney representing her.  Furthermore, she \nwill soon be required to appear in the Houston Immigration Court and will need her trusted \nattorney to represent her in those proceedings as well. \n21. These clients have an expectation that GHIRP will timely prepare their case, appear in \ncourt  on  their  behalf,  and  complete  the  case  in  accordance  with  our  attorney-client \nrepresentation agreements. In order to comply with our client obligations, we have had to \nutilize operating expenses that were set aside for other purposes because we are not able to \nhalt legal representation on a moment’s notice.   \n22. GHIRP’s legal team will not withdraw from client cases immediately.  Our management \nteam is determining how long we can continue representing our clients without funding, \nconsidering the number of clients we represent, the procedural posture of each case, and \nthe staff capacity for casework with a reduced team due to funding.  Due to the sudden \ncontract termination, we must decide which cases to retain, and which staff will remain at \nthe organization (if any). GHIRP attorneys and representatives have an ethical duty to \nrepresent our current clients and to advocate for their interests.  To abruptly withdraw from \nour clients’ cases will be detrimental to their legal case, and a direct impairment to our \nexisting core activities. Clients will age out of legal relief, may be forced to abandon relief \ndue to missed filing deadlines, and/or they will not be able to pursue their cases in court \neffectively alone without representation.  Our attorneys are the attorney of record in \nimmigration court and state court, and judges may not allow for our withdrawal at such a \nlate stage of the case.  If they do allow for withdrawal, our young clients will not have the \ntime and resources to obtain new counsel within the courts’ deadlines and/or scheduled \nhearings.  \n23. The financial impact of the contract termination profoundly affects GHIRP, as the entire \ncontract for legal services for unaccompanied children represents approximately 45% of \nour organizational budget and staff. Our organization served 2,625 immigrants in the \ncommunity last year, of which 1,469 (or 57%) were unaccompanied children receiving \nservices through this contract.  GHIRP is not able to maintain the same level of legal \nservices for unaccompanied minors without HHS funding, and we will be required to lay \noff most of our Immigrant Children and Youth staff in approximately four weeks. We will \nrely on unrestricted funds and savings to pay staff during this time, however, drawing down \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 166\n\n(191 of 348), Page 191 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 191 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 8\non these funds will destabilize the organization as a whole. This will divert unrestricted \nfunds away from other services, as these resources typically cover gaps in funding between \ncontract  cycles  on  other  grants,  underfunded  programs,  or  new  initiatives  that  are \nresponsive to emerging needs of the community.  \n24. GHIRP’s staff members serving immigrant children and youth are exceptionally passionate \nabout providing legal services to children and are currently distraught by the recent contract \ntermination. All have had formal and/or on-the-job training related to educating and \nrepresenting children and youth and have developed unique skills to provide child-friendly \nlegal services.  Over the years, our team has built rapport with our clients, assisted them in \nnavigating personal and legal issues, and dedicated a significant amount of time and \nresources to zealously advocating for their clients.  Through our services, we hope to \nachieve our goals of obtaining safety and stability for our clients so that they can thrive.  \nAn interruption in services risks re-traumatizing them and causing them to lose the progress \nthey  have  made  so  far  in  their  trajectory  toward  opportunity.  The  abrupt  contract \ntermination has impacted staff morale and caused incredible amounts of stress. Having to \nwithdraw representation may be a violation of our ethical duties to our clients and will \nlikely lead to their deportation, placing our clients in harm’s way.  Our children view our \nteam as a reliable support, which many clients lack in other aspects of their lives. These \nconsequences deeply impact our staff, who are dedicated, compassionate professionals. \n25. Such results are antithetical to our values and impede our ability to carry out GHIRP’s \nmission. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Houston, Texas.           \n            \n_/s/ Elizabeth Sanchez Kennedy______ \nElizabeth Sanchez Kennedy \nExecutive Director \n6001 Savoy Drive, Ste. 400 \nHouston, Texas 77036 \nPh: (713) 588-2260 \nEmail: Chiqui@ghirp.org \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 167\n\n(192 of 348), Page 192 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 192 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 9\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF WENDY YOUNG \nPALO ALTO, et al., \n(KIND) IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \n \nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY \nPlaintiffs, \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND \nv.

Pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C. § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct.  \n1.  My name is Wendy Young, and I am the President of KIND, Inc., doing business as Kids \nin  Need  of  Defense  (“KIND”).  KIND  is  the  leading  international  not-for-profit \norganization devoted to protecting the rights and well-being of unaccompanied and \nseparated children.  Founded in 2008, KIND now has seventeen locations across the \nUnited States that have provided legal rights education to more than 78,000 children, and \nlegal representation in immigration matters to more than 17,000 children in the United \nStates. KIND staff provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children who \nare in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) at 20 short-term shelter care or foster care facilities, \nfive long-term foster care programs, and three Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) \nprograms served by KIND’s offices in Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Fresno, CA; Hartford, \nCT; Houston, TX; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Sacramento, CA; and Seattle, WA.  \nKIND also serves children released from ORR care and living in the communities served \nby those offices and by our offices and locations in Baltimore, MD; the District of \nColumbia; Jacksonville, FL; Newark, NJ; Northern Virginia; Orlando, FL; Providence, \nRI; and San Francisco, CA. \n2.  KIND provides representation and other services to migrant children in part through its \nstaff, and in part through pro bono partnerships with nearly 900 law firms, corporations, \nlaw  schools,  and  bar  associations,  whose  lawyers  provide  children  with  pro  bono \nrepresentation with training and support from KIND.  KIND also provides psychosocial \nsupport to children and families; works to address the root causes of child migration; and \nadvocates for laws, policies, and practices to improve the protection of unaccompanied \nchildren within the U.S. and abroad. \n(1) During children’s time in ORR custody, KIND conducts educational “know your \nrights” (“KYR”) presentations that provide unaccompanied children with information \nabout the immigration system, their rights and responsibilities, and what to expect in \nimmigration  court.    KIND  also  conducts  legal  screenings  to  assess  each  child’s \nprotection needs and evaluate options for legal relief as well as making appropriate \nreferrals for further legal or social services during or after ORR custody.  As needed, \nKIND may also support children in requests for release on recognizance or with \nnotifications relating to changes of address and venue.  \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 169\n\n(194 of 348), Page 194 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 194 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 9\n(2) During ORR custody, if a child is required to attend immigration court, KIND will \neducate the child about immigration court processes and prepare them to attend the \nhearing, and will accompany the child to court in the capacity of “friend of the court” \nor, in limited circumstances, as attorney of record.  \n(3) During ORR custody, KIND may provide legal representation for certain children \nwhere services as “friend of the court” are not sufficient for the child’s needs – for \nexample, for children who are required to enter pleadings in their immigration removal \nproceedings during their time in ORR care, or children who are placed in federal long-\nterm foster care. \n(4) Many children who live in communities served by KIND following release from \nORR custody receive free legal representation through KIND’s network of pro bono \nattorneys and/or KIND staff.  The KIND mentor assigned to each pro bono attorney \noffers specialized training programs and guidance on substantive law and skills needed \nfor representing children, addresses the pro bono attorney’s questions, consults on case \nstrategy, offers access to psychosocial services and other resources, and provides \nsupport at all phases of a child’s immigration case.  KIND staff and KIND pro bono \nattorneys  represent  children  in  proceedings  before  the  immigration  courts,  in \nadministrative  proceedings  before  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services \n(USCIS), in ancillary proceedings in state courts, and occasionally before the Board of \nImmigration Appeals, federal district courts, or federal courts of appeal. \n4.  KIND’s five original offices began providing legal services for released unaccompanied \nimmigrant children through pro bono partnerships in January 2009, with two of those \noffices  adding  services  for  detained  children  later  that  year.  Over  time,  KIND’s \nprogramming  expanded  to  include  additional  locations  in  the  United  States,  plus  a \nprogram dedicated to serving children separated from their parents.  Beyond the United \nStates, KIND has staff in Mexico, Central America, and several countries in Europe, with \na focus on protection, family unity, and strengthening child protection systems and access \nto lawful immigration pathways. KIND works with organizational and private sector \npartners to harness additional capacity in those regions.   \n5.  For the period January 2022 through December 2024 inclusive, KIND’s subcontract with \nAcacia supported know-your-rights presentations and legal screenings to over 16,900 \nchildren  in  ORR  custody,  immigration  legal  representation  for  approximately  6,700 \nchildren  through  KIND  and  its  pro  bono  attorneys,  and  psychosocial  services  for \napproximately 2,400 children.  During the same period, through other contracts and other \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 170\n\n(195 of 348), Page 195 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 195 of 348\nresources, KIND and its pro bono partners additionally represented approximately 3,700 \nchildren, and KIND provided psychosocial services to approximately 1,100 children.   \n6.  In or about March 2022, KIND entered into a subcontract with the Vera Institute of Justice \nto  deliver  specified  legal  services  to  children  arriving  in  the  United  States  as \nunaccompanied children, renewable annually over a five-year period. KIND’s current \ncontract with Acacia Center for Justice is a novation of that contract.  The KIND-Acacia \nsubcontract is in turn funded by a contract between Acacia and ORR.  All of KIND’s \nseventeen locations in the United States deliver legal and social services funded through \nits subcontract with Acacia. From 2009 through 2021, KIND served children pursuant to \nsubcontracts with Acacia’s predecessor, the Vera Institute for Justice.        \n7.  KIND staff regularly travel to almost twenty ORR shelter care and transitional foster care \nfacilities in person, while one shelter regularly arranges for groups of children to visit the \nlocal KIND office in person due to capacity limitations at the ORR facility.  The frequency \nof these visits varies with need, but on average, each KIND site held about four visits per \nmonth during 2024.  KIND uses these visits to provide know-your-rights presentations, \nconduct legal screenings, prepare clients for court hearings, or conduct individual legal \nconsultations.  KIND staff also represent children placed in federal long-term foster care \nand in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program.  \n8.  Immigration  removal  proceedings  are  adversarial  proceedings  commenced  by  the \nDepartment of Homeland Security before immigration courts within the Department of \nJustice.  Unaccompanied  children,  including  very  young  children,  are  named  as \n“respondents,” and must answer charges of removability and bear the burden of proof to \nestablish a defense to forcible removal to countries where their rights, well-being, safety, \nor even their lives were at risk.  The free legal and psychosocial services provided by \nKIND, and by other ORR-funded legal services providers, are essential to protecting the \nbasic rights of children facing this process. Unaccompanied children do not have the \nfinancial resources to hire private counsel at market rates, and in KIND’s experience, few \nhave family members of such means.  Without free services, unaccompanied children -- \nincluding  very  young,  pre-verbal,  and  non-walking  children  --  would  be  forced  to \nrepresent themselves through complex legal processes, facing trained and experienced \ngovernment counsel while striving to present evidence and legal arguments in their own \ndefense.   \n9.  Legal screenings by KIND staff for children in ORR custody serve to determine whether \nit is unsafe for a child to return to their country of origin, and to identify options for \navailable legal relief in the United States. These assessments are necessary prerequisites \nto placement with pro bono attorneys who primarily practice in areas of law other than \nimmigration, and depend on KIND for case assessments, training, practice guidance, and \nongoing mentorship.  KIND’s pro bono partners contributed approximately 1,487,244 \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 171\n\n(196 of 348), Page 196 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 196 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 9\nhours of legal services, valued at over $889,000,000 dollars from 2009 to 2023. Thus, pro \nbono representation with KIND mentorship multiplies the effectiveness of the funding \nORR provides to KIND. \n10.  Through legal representation by KIND or its pro bono partners, children pursue one or \nmore forms of humanitarian relief, such as protection from parental maltreatment through \nspecial immigrant juvenile status, asylum based on a fear of persecution, T- or U-visas that \nprotect victims of trafficking or other serious crimes, or temporary protected status based \non untenable conditions in the country of origin.  Children’s immigration cases have long \ntimelines:  in KIND’s experience, while a small proportion of cases resulting in permanent \nstatus are completed within two years, the majority take five to seven years to complete, \nwith some taking longer.  The chief reason is adjudication timelines.  The immigration \ncourt backlog currently stands at well over 3.6 million cases, with wait times between \nhearings  typically  stretching  to  months  or  years.    Moreover,  most  applications  for \nhumanitarian relief are adjudicated outside immigration courts.  In 2024, USCIS stated \nthat over 1.1 million asylum applications were pending before it, and applicants for other \nforms of relief likewise face years-long delays, most notably, the years-long waits for the \nlimited supply of visas affecting special immigrant juveniles waiting to apply for green \ncards.   These delays are beyond the control of children and their advocates.  In addition, \nthe process of preparing children’s applications for relief is time-consuming for several \nreasons.  First, depending on the relief sought, evidentiary support for applications may \ninclude elements that require time and effort to obtain, such as: state juvenile court orders \nissued after evidentiary hearings; attestations by state or federal law enforcement officers; \nand/or medical, psychological, or other expert evaluations.  In cases where a child’s initial \nrequest for relief is not approved, further time may be required to respond to requests for \nevidence or notices of intent to deny, as well as for appellate processes.  Second, children \nin general, and particularly those who have experienced traumatic events, will need time \nto develop trust in unfamiliar adults and in the legal process itself, as the American Bar \nAssociation has recognized in cautioning against pressuring children to discuss distressing \nexperiences before they are ready to do so.  Third and more generally, preparation of a \nchild’s case takes time due to the capacity limitations inherent in children’s ongoing \ncognitive  and  emotional  development.   As  a  principal  drafter  of  the  2008 TVPRA \nexplained, a child “usually knows nothing about U.S. courts or immigration policies and \nfrequently does not speak English . . . . The majority of these children have been forced to \nstruggle through an immigration system designed for adults.” (Cong. Rec. S10886 (Dec. \n10, 2008) (Sen. Feinstein)).  State codes of professional responsibility typically require \nattorneys representing children with diminished capacity to maintain a normal attorney-\nclient relationship to the greatest extent possible, and under American Bar Association \nstandards, children must be afforded the right to meaningfully participate in decision-\nmaking  in  their  cases.   Accordingly,  best  practices  for  representing  unaccompanied \nchildren  contemplate  applying  trauma-informed  and  child-sensitive  practices  and \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 172\n\n(197 of 348), Page 197 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 197 of 348\naffording sufficient time to support the child client’s understanding of the proceedings and \ndeliberation on matters affecting the child’s well-being.  Fourth, children are not self-\nsufficient, so their participation in preparing a legal case depends on facilitation by \nindividual or institutional caregivers who may present time constraints that are beyond a \nchild’s control – for example, something as simple as a caregiver being unable to obtain \nleave from work to transport a child to a session with an attorney or expert.  In sum, \nrepresenting  children  in  immigration  matters  requires  a  sustained  multi-year  time \ncommitment in order to meet stringent evidentiary burdens, present effective advocacy, \nand support children in navigating complex and high-stakes processes.   \n11.  Officials  with  government  agencies  have  repeatedly  recognized  how  KIND’s  work \ncontributes to their efficient and effective operations in handling children’s cases.  Among \nother  contributions,  at  the  request  of  agency  officials,  KIND  staff  have  conducted \nnumerous training programs on topics relating to children’s immigration matters for staff \nof the immigration courts, USCIS, and the ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor \n(OPLA), which represents the government in removal proceedings. As one example \namong many, after KIND staff presented to USCIS asylum office staff on child-friendly \ninterviewing techniques, senior officials of the office sent handwritten notes thanking \nKIND staff for the program.  The office director stated, “I know our officers will greatly \nbenefit from it!” and one training officer added, “We hope we can make it an annual \nevent.”  \n12.  Another example is a well-received initiative by KIND’s Boston office to accelerate the \nsuccessful completion of numerous pending cases of KIND clients awaiting adjudication \nof their applications for lawful permanent residency (LPR) status, also known as a green \ncard.  LPR applicants have already cleared high legal standards and progressed through \nyears-long waiting lists, only to wait again for scheduling of a merits hearing date in \nimmigration court.  To alleviate that bottleneck, during 2021, KIND staff identified dozens \nof clients who were immediately eligible to adjust status, lacking only a date on the court’s \ncalendar for an adjustment hearing.  Normally, just a handful of cases would be scheduled \nfor an adjustment hearing on a given date, but through KIND’s coordination with OPLA \nattorneys and immigration court staff, 50 adjustment-ready cases were calendared on two \nselected dates in May and November 2021.  By organizing required information to share \nwith OPLA in advance, KIND helped to ensure a smooth and efficient hearing for each \ncase.  The court approved 21 cases on the May 2021 date, 25 children on the November \n2021 date, and the remainder on follow-up dates.  Both the immigration court and OPLA \npraised KIND for efficiencies that resulted in removing cases in bulk from the court’s \ncrowded docket as the KIND clients received permanent status.   \n13.  On the afternoon of February 18, 2025, Acacia emailed KIND a redacted copy of a \nnationwide order that HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) issued to stop \nwork  under  the  Legal  Services  for  Unaccompanied  Children  contract,  effective \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 173\n\n(198 of 348), Page 198 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 198 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 9\nimmediately.  The stop-work order applied to all lines of work performed under the \ncontract, including KIND’s work on KYR presentations and legal screenings for children \nin ORR facilities, and legal representation for unaccompanied children in and outside \nORR custody.  Without further elaboration, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.”  \n14.  Based on the directives in the stop-work order, KIND instructed staff to immediately \nsuspend visits to facilities served under the contract, stop accepting new referrals, cancel \nintake meetings with prospective clients, and not sign retainer agreements to take on new \nclients. KIND also instructed staff to continue critical ongoing work necessary to fulfill \nprofessional responsibilities to clients, including meeting filing deadlines and attending \nscheduled hearings and administrative interviews with clients.  On the afternoon of \nFebruary 21, 2025, KIND learned from Acacia that HHS had rescinded the stop-work \norder, without explanation.   \n15.  On March 21, 2025, Acacia informed KIND via email that Acacia had received a notice \npartially terminating Contract 140D0422C0009, under which KIND is a subcontractor, for \nthe government’s convenience.  Acacia stated that the contract was terminated effective \nthat same date for three of the four Contract Line Numbers (CLINs), and directed that \nwork stop immediately under CLIN2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children \nnot in ORR custody; CLIN3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows to represent \nunaccompanied children separately from those represented through CLIN 2; and CLIN4, \nSpanish  language  tutoring  for  organizational  staff  who  work  with  children.  KIND \nunderstands that only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal \nconsultations for unrepresented children in ORR facilities, remains in place, and is \nawaiting guidance from Acacia regarding whether there will be revisions to the relevant \ntask orders, such as modifications to KYR services and any attendant budget or staffing \nchanges.  \n16.  Partial termination of the Acacia contract deprives KIND of the funding KIND relies on \nto employ approximately 350 professionals actively engaged in delivering or supporting \nthe legal representation of some 6,700 clients.  KIND cannot retain employees once \ncontractual funding sources are unavailable, and we anticipate significant layoffs, starting \nwithin days of the contract termination. This interruption of employment disrupts the \nproductivity, career development, and morale of scores of qualified and experienced \nworkers who are skilled and experienced in serving unaccompanied children, and who \ncannot easily find replacement opportunities due to the broad geographic scope of the \npartial contract termination.  More importantly, the partial contract termination makes the \nqualifications and experience of these employees unavailable to children in need of \nspecialized services.  Most funding KIND has received through other sources is dedicated \nto employing staff who provide specified services to additional clients through other \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 174\n\n(199 of 348), Page 199 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 199 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 9\nprograms, and thus such employees and funding cannot compensate for the needs created \nby the partial contract termination.   \n17.  Partial  termination  of  the Acacia  contract  will  disrupt  thousands  of  attorney-client \nrelationships on which children have relied, for multiple years in some cases, and leaves \nchildren without support for the completion of their pending cases. The sudden disruption \nof an established attorney-client relationship would be a blow for children who have \ninvested time to develop a relationship of trust, particularly in the wake of traumatic \nexperiences that led them to migrate in search of safety.  This is particularly so because \nchild clients benefit from a trauma-informed and child-centered practice as is cultivated at \nKIND.  Many children served through KIND face impending deadlines or events in their \ncases. As of the date of this declaration, approximately 200 clients represented by KIND \nstaff or by pro bono attorneys receiving KIND’s mentorship are scheduled for master or \nindividual hearings in immigration courts in the next 60 days.  This includes clients with \nimmigration court hearings docketed for March 25, March 27, and April 8.  A similar \nnumber of other required actions are scheduled in KIND’s cases in the next 60 days, \nincluding hearings in state court proceedings, deadlines to respond to requests for evidence \nin connection with immigration applications, and other filing deadlines and events.   \n18.  KIND relied on contractual funding to commence representation in thousands of matters \nthat, as discussed above, require years to complete.  ORR’s partial termination of the \ncontract will not automatically suspend pending removal proceedings nor resolve pending \napplications for relief.  Nor will the partial contract termination automatically suspend \ndeadlines in children’s cases, such as requirements to file an application or motion within \na  specified  time  period  or  before  a  client  reaches  a  specified  age.    KIND  retains \nprofessional obligations toward these thousands of vulnerable clients.

The partial termination of the Acacia contract impedes KIND’s mission of ensuring that\n    no child appears in immigration court without high-quality legal representation.  For all\n               of the reasons discussed here, KIND believes that the partial termination of the Acacia\n            contract  will  upset  children’s  serious  reliance  interests  in  ongoing  attorney-client\n           relationships,  diminish  fairness,  implicate  due  process  considerations, impede the\n      efficiency and effectiveness of court and agency processes due to increased numbers of\n    unrepresented children, andthereby risk severe harm to children who have relied on their\n   attorneys to see their claims for protection and relief through to conclusion.    \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.   \n      Executed on the25th of March2025, inFalls Church, Virginia         \n              \n    /s/  Wend y Youn g  \nWendy Young \nPresident \nKids in Need of Defense\nPO Box 27839 \nWashington, DC 20038\n \n8 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 176\n\n(201 of 348), Page 201 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 201 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF MIGUEL ANGEL \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nMEXICANO  FURMANSKA IN \n \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under(cid:2271)penalty(cid:2271)of(cid:2271)perjury(cid:2271)that the following statement \nis true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(cid:2271)§(cid:2271)1746. \n1.  I, Miguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska, serve as Managing Attorney and Proprietor of the \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano, PC. \n \n2.  The Law Office of Miguel Mexicano provides comprehensive legal representation to \nvulnerable unaccompanied children facing immigration legal challenges.  Our practice \nextends to children released from Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody to \nfamily members or guardians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  Additionally, we stand \nas the legal service provider for children remaining in ORR custody within the long-term \nfoster care provider at MarSell Wellness Center in Ontario, California. \n \n3.  Our dedicated team is comprised of attorneys and legal professionals who have devoted \ntheir careers to advocating for society’s most vulnerable populations.  Our mission centers \non  protecting  unaccompanied  children,  arguably  the  most  defenseless  subset  of \nimmigrants, through zealous representation in  deportation proceedings, navigation of \napplications for legal relief with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), \nand educational outreach through “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations. \n \n4.  The Law Office of Miguel Mexicano fulfills its mission through five essential service \ncomponents:    (1)  Representing  unaccompanied  minors  outside  ORR  custody  in \nimmigration proceedings;  (2) Advocating for children within ORR custody throughout \ntheir immigration journey;  (3) Delivering vital legal education through KYR presentations;  \n(4) Providing specialized representation in state court proceedings for minors eligible for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”);  and (5) Representing children during critical \nasylum interviews before USCIS. \n \n5.  Since 2016, the Law Office of Miguel Mexicano has established itself as a steadfast \nprovider of legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children throughout California, \nthough our formal subcontractor relationship with ORR began in September 2023.  Our \ncommitment to this vital work stems from our extensive expertise in advocating for \nunaccompanied  children,  including  my  personal  12-year  experience  in  this  field.  \nCurrently, our practice extends representation to approximately 120 children, including a \nselect cohort of minors in ORR custody at MarSell Wellness Center in Ontario, California. \n \n1 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 178\n\n(203 of 348), Page 203 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 203 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\n6.  Through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, our firm has \nassembled  a  dedicated  team  of  11  full-time  professionals  committed  to  serving \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  This exceptional team includes six attorneys with \nspecialized immigration expertise, three skilled paralegals, and a dedicated legal assistant, \nall working under my leadership. \n \n7.  Our practice involves regular visitation with foster care clients and vigorous representation \nbefore the Immigration Court.  We further extend our advocacy to children pursuing asylum \nthrough the asylum office and navigate state court proceedings for those qualifying for \nSIJS—a critical form of relief designed specifically for children who have suffered abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect.  Beyond legal representation, we serve as holistic advocates, \nfacilitating connections to essential social services, healthcare resources, and mental health \nsupport.   \n \n8.  The majority of our clients qualify for either SIJS or asylum.  These legal pathways demand \nthe expertise of skilled counsel to navigate successfully.  These children have endured \ntraumatic experiences of abuse, neglect, or persecution in their countries of origin, creating \nlegal complexities that would be insurmountable without professional legal guidance.  \n \n9.  Know Your Rights presentations and legal representation are essential for unaccompanied \nchildren who face multiple barriers to justice.  Most cannot afford private representation, \nwith typical legal fees starting at $5,000.  Language barriers severely limit their ability to \nunderstand proceedings, as most speak Spanish or indigenous languages.  Immigration \nlaw’s complexity—with intricate procedures, strict deadlines, and specialized standards—\nis incomprehensible even to many adults.  The geographic isolation of facilities and limited \ntransportation and distance from courts further restricts access to legal help. Even in a \nregion like mine -Los Angeles- with ample Spanish speaking resources, there is a severe \nshortage  of  attorneys  with  the  specialized  expertise  required  for  these  cases—\nencompassing immigration law, state law, and trauma-informed advocacy.  Only a handful \nof nonprofit and private attorneys are equipped to handle these matters.  Without our \nservices, many children would face near-certain deportation, regardless of their legal \neligibility for relief or the dangers awaiting them in their countries of origin. \n \n10. One illustrative case involved a young girl who diligently attempted to monitor her \nImmigration Court proceedings by periodically contacting the court system to determine \nher hearing schedule.  Despite her best efforts, she received either late notification or no \nnotification at all regarding her hearing, resulting in an “in absentia” removal order.  She \nwas ordered removed from the country for failing to appear in court.  Upon accepting her \nrepresentation,  we  immediately  identified  her  eligibility  for  SIJS  based  on  paternal \nabandonment.  We  promptly  initiated  custody  proceedings  in  state  court  while \n2 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 179\n\n(204 of 348), Page 204 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 204 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nsimultaneously filing a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court.  Through our \nintervention, this young client successfully reopened her case and secured the necessary \npredicate order to pursue a Special Immigrant Juvenile visa.  Our timely representation \ntransformed her circumstances from imminent deportation to a clear pathway toward \nlawful permanent residency. \n \n11. Our  legal  team  receives  consistent  recognition  and  welcome  across  various  venues \nincluding Immigration Court and USCIS, and during interactions with the Office of \nPrincipal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”)/Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), as we \nfacilitate streamlined processes and advocate for justice.  Immigration Court judges have \nrepeatedly acknowledged the positive impact of our representation on children’s lives and \nour contribution to creating more efficient and humane Immigration Court proceedings.  \nOur  professional  engagement  enables  productive  communication  with  government \nattorneys  to  advance  and  resolve  cases  expeditiously.    In  one  notable  instance,  an \nImmigration Judge in Santa Ana explicitly expressed gratitude for our meticulous work in \nhelping a minor seek and obtain relief effectively and efficiently.  The judge acknowledged \nthat our diligent  representation transformed the entire process, leading to a positive \noutcome that might  otherwise have resulted in years of procedural delays, potential \nviolations of due process rights, and ultimately, deportation.  Our intervention prevented \nburdensome continuances and the overwhelming complexity that a vulnerable child would \nface navigating the system alone. \n \n12. We have garnered similar judicial recognition in state court proceedings while pursuing \nSIJS through Probate and Family Courts.  Judges in these forums have commended our \nexemplary  filings  and  professional  conduct,  even  suggesting  that  our  team  provide \neducational training to other attorneys practicing in this specialized field. \n \n13.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the \nInterior) issued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied \nChildren,  effective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  four Contract  Line Numbers \n(CLINs). Without further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated \nthat it “shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented \ndue to causes outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for \npoor performance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. \n \n14. The timing of the initial work stoppage order was particularly disruptive, arriving on \nTuesday, February 18, 2025, mid-week during a period when our office had scheduled at \nleast 10 hearings across immigration and state courts for our unaccompanied minor clients. \nThis disruption coincided with an approaching critical filing deadline for unaccompanied \n3 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 180\n\n(205 of 348), Page 205 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 205 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nminors who potentially qualified as members of the J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit—a certified \nnationwide class action challenging a Trump administration policy that restricted asylum \neligibility  for  certain  unaccompanied  children  arriving  from  2019  onward. With  the \ndeadline set for February 24, 2025, we were in the final stages of preparing numerous \nasylum applications for affected minors.  \n \n15. On March 21, 2025, the situation dramatically worsened. HHS (operating through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025.  \nThis directive terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children as well as other non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities.  Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4.  HHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than \n“the Government’s convenience.”  \n \n16. This contract termination has necessitated immediate and difficult communications with \nMarSell Wellness Center Ontario. On March 21, 2025, I personally informed the Center's \nDirector  that  all  our  services  would  cease  immediately,  except  for  the  minimal \nrepresentation  legally  and  ethically  required  for  children  with  already  scheduled \nImmigration Court proceedings. I explained that we would be unable to help any new \narrivals at their facility, and that with all existing cases we would need to wind down our \nservices where ethically possible. This abrupt cessation of services places considerable \nstrain on the facility, which now must attempt to secure alternative legal representation in \na region with few qualified immigration attorneys willing to take on these specialized \ncases. I don’t believe the center has a contingency plan in place and they will likely need \nto divert resources from other critical services to address this sudden gap in legal support. \n \n17. The moment the aforementioned contract was terminated, it created an immediate crisis \nfor our vulnerable child clients. After assessing our ethical duties and limited resources, the \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano can continue representing only the most pressing of our \napproximately 120 unaccompanied minors—specifically those with court dates or filing \ndeadlines.  This week for instance, we have immigration court scheduled for a minor on \nFriday, Mach 28, 2025, a Probate Court hearing on Wednesday March 26, 2025, and a Long \nTerm Foster Care client that wants to pursue voluntary departure because she wants to \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 181\n\n(206 of 348), Page 206 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 206 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nreturn to her home country because of an ill grandmother. Not knowing whether this \nunavoidable work will be funded is creating tremendous strain on our office. For all other \ncases, we must regrettably start to unwind and withdraw representation where ethically \npossible, filing appropriate motions with immigration courts and providing clients with \ncase files  and guidance materials, though this offers minimal practical assistance to \nchildren  navigating  complex  legal  proceedings.  This  abrupt  termination  undermines \nprotections  established  by  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act  (TVPRA)  of  2008,  which  recognized  unaccompanied  children's \nvulnerabilities and established safeguards including access to counsel. Our clients have \ndeveloped trusted relationships with our attorneys, often sharing traumatic experiences \nforming the basis of their legal claims. Without HHS funding, hundreds of children across \nour region will face deportation proceedings unrepresented, effectively nullifying their \nright to seek humanitarian protection despite legal eligibility. \n18. This termination impacts approximately 80% of our operational funding. The financial \nconsequences—including potential furloughs, layoffs, or significant staff reduction—will \nbe  devastating.  I’ve  already  communicated  with  my  team  that  they  in  fact  may  be \nfurloughed or laid off. As of Monday March 24, 2025, I cut my staff’s hours in half. Very \nsoon I will likely be forced to lay off half my staff, severely compromising our ability to \nfulfill our ethical obligations to clients. As the firm’s owner and manager, I am facing \nextreme overtime demands to sustain operations while enduring substantial financial losses \nthat might reach in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ultimately, continuing our \nrepresentation of unaccompanied minors is financially unsustainable. \n \n19. Beyond its operational impact, the partial contract termination has created a profound sense \nof uncertainty and demoralization among our professional team, hindering our capacity to \nprovide the zealous advocacy our vulnerable clients deserve.  The funding gap will force \nme to utilize personal financial resources to maintain operations and meet staff payroll \nobligations, something I had to do during the previous February 18, 2025, stop work order.  \nCollectively,  this  disruption  has  significantly  impaired  our  ability  to  provide \ncomprehensive assistance to children navigating the complexities of their immigration \ncases.  \n \n20. This funding loss will have immediate and severe consequences.  Within 15 days, we will \nbe forced to lay off half our staff, and within 30 days, our representation program will be \ninsolvent.  While we could potentially redirect money from our limited private cases, this \nwould only sustain minimal operations while compromising our overall services.  Even \nwith eventual backpay, we would incur significant financial harm through interest on \nemergency loans, rehiring costs, and damaged client relationships.  Crucially, children face \ngaps in representation during which filing deadlines might expire, permanently affecting \ntheir immigration relief options.  \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 182\n\n(207 of 348), Page 207 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 207 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 25 of March 2025, in Pomona, CA.            \n          \n_______________________________  \nMiguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska \nManaging Attorney/Owner \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano, PC \nUCP Legal Service Provider \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 183\n\n(208 of 348), Page 208 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 208 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a goef  410 of 44\n1  IMMIGRANT DEFENDERS LAW CENTER  AMICA CENTER FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS \nAlvaro M.

Every day, in immigration courts across the country, unaccompanied children stand (or \n3 \nsit, with legs dangling over chairs, or are held in caretakers’ arms) in front of federal immigration \n4 \njudges, across from Department of Homeland Security lawyers, in adversarial removal proceedings.  \n5 \nThousands of other unaccompanied children are not in removal proceedings—but nonetheless must \n6 \nnavigate the country’s complex immigration laws as they attempt to complete complicated and lengthy \n7 \napplications allowing them to seek lawful status in the United States.  These children, including babies \n8 \n9  and toddlers, arrived in the United States without a parent or legal guardian.  The vast majority do not \n10  speak English; the babies do not speak at all.  Most do not have the means to hire a lawyer. \n11 \n2.  In one case, a one-year-old named Johan appeared in the Phoenix Immigration Court in \n12 \n2018 with a bottle of milk and a purple ball—but without a parent or legal guardian.  The judge in \n13 \nJohan’s case was “embarrassed to ask” if Johan understood the proceedings.  Turning to Johan’s \n14 \nattorney, the judge addressed the absurdity of the legal theater playing out in his courtroom:  “I don’t \n15 \nknow who you would explain it to, unless you think that a 1-year-old could learn immigration law.”  \n16 \n17  Sasha  Ingber,  1-Year-Old  Shows  Up  In  Immigration  Court,  NPR  (July  8,  2018), \n18 \nhttps://perma.cc/ALU7-RM6V.  Johan’s story is not unusual, and demonstrates that the only way that \n19 \nmany unaccompanied children can navigate the immigration legal system is with the help of a lawyer. \n20 \n3.  Each unaccompanied child has their own individual story, but there are common themes.  \n21 \nWhile many unaccompanied children are from Central America and the “Northern Triangle” countries \n22 \nof Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, unaccompanied children come from all over the world.  \n23 \n24  Most speak Spanish; some only speak indigenous Central American languages.  Few speak much \n25  English.  Many fled their home countries for their personal safety, escaping from gang violence, sexual \n26 \nviolence, political violence, extreme poverty, and other dangers, only to experience further violence \n27 \n28 \n4 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 187\n\n(212 of 348), Page 212 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 212 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 40\n \n \n1  and even trafficking during their long and dangerous journeys north to the United States.  No matter \n2 \ntheir country of origin or spoken language, all are incredibly vulnerable. \n3 \n4.  Recognizing the needs of these children who are attempting to navigate the complex \n4 \nimmigration  system  on  their  own,  Congress  enacted  laws  to  provide  special  protections  for \n5 \nunaccompanied children in that system.  These include the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \n6 \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), which requires that the government “shall ensure, \n7 \n8  to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent \n9  them in “legal proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n10 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079. \n11 \n5.  More recently, the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“HHS”) Office of \n12 \nRefugee Resettlement (“ORR”) issued a Foundational Rule, published in 2024, meant, in part, to carry \n13 \nout the agency’s obligations under the TVPRA as well as the earlier 1997 settlement in Flores v. Reno \n14 \n(which dictates certain government obligations to unaccompanied children).  Unaccompanied Children \n15 \n16  Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384 (Apr. 30, 2024) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 410 (the \n17 \n“Foundational  Rule”)).    The  Foundational  Rule  requires  the  government  to  “fund  legal  service \n18 \nproviders to provide direct immigration legal representation” to unaccompanied children if there are \n19 \n“available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal orientation, consultation with a lawyer, \n20 \nand ongoing access to lawyers.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a) (2024). \n21 \n6.  Congress has appropriated funds to ensure as many unaccompanied children as possible \n22 \n23  are represented by lawyers.  For fiscal year 2024, for example, Congress appropriated more than $5 \n24  billion  for  Defendants  to  deliver  services  to  unaccompanied  children  under  various  statutory \n25 \nobligations, which includes funding to provide legal representation for unaccompanied children under \n26 \nthe TVPRA “to the greatest extent practicable.”  This appropriation is now available to fund legal \n27 \nrepresentations through September 30, 2027. \n28 \n5 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 188\n\n(213 of 348), Page 213 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 213 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 6a goef  460 of 44\n \n \n1  7.  For  more  than  a  decade,  until  March  21,  2025—under  different  presidential \n2 \nadministrations and changing immigration policies—the government fulfilled its obligations under the \n3 \nTVPRA and ongoing congressional appropriations to fund legal representation for unaccompanied \n4 \nchildren.  Through this funding, every unaccompanied child in government custody (at shelters run by \n5 \nORR, under the authority of HHS) had the opportunity to receive a group “know your rights” session \n6 \nand an individual legal screening, and many children received direct legal representation from legal \n7 \n8  service  providers.    These  representations  helped  bridge  the  significant  gap  in  legal  access  for \n9  unaccompanied children, only a small number of whom can afford paid representation or are able to \n10 \nindependently retain a pro bono attorney.  They also helped immigration courts function efficiently and \n11 \navoided forcing immigration judges and government lawyers to engage directly with children in \n12 \nresponding to immigration charges and related questions around relief from removal. \n13 \n8.  Plaintiffs are legal service providers that, until March 21, 2025, provided representation \n14 \nand related services to unaccompanied children with funding from Defendants.  Plaintiffs furthered the \n15 \n16  TVPRA’s goals and the requirements in the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule by providing basic \n17 \nlegal services to unaccompanied children and by representing unaccompanied children in immigration \n18 \ncourt, affirmative immigration proceedings, and related state court proceedings.   \n19 \n9.  Now, Plaintiffs have largely had to stop taking on new clients and face the real threat of \n20 \nnot  being  able  to  continue  their  ongoing  representations.    For  example,  without  funding  from \n21 \nDefendants, Plaintiff Community Legal Service in East Palo Alto has had to stop taking on new \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children clients—even if the children face upcoming court dates without a lawyer—\n24  and if it cannot find other funding sources, its ability to represent existing clients (taken on in reliance \n25 \non continued funding from Defendants) will be in jeopardy.  Plaintiffs’ inability to serve new clients \n26 \nor provide certainty for existing clients is an enormous harm to their mission to serve as many \n27 \nunaccompanied children as possible. \n28 \n6 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 189\n\n(214 of 348), Page 214 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 214 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 7a goef  470 of 44\n \n \n1  10.  Plaintiffs’ clients range in age from infants to teenagers, all of whom depend on \n2 \nPlaintiffs for critical legal counsel.  For example, Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center represents \n3 \na 16-year-old girl and her one-year-old son in cases that were funded by Defendants until March 21, \n4 \n2025.  Beginning at the age of six years old, the girl was sex trafficked by her family in Mexico.  After \n5 \ngiving birth to her son, she fled to the U.S. to save him from the same fate. \n6 \n11.  On March 21, 2025, without warning, Defendant the U.S. Department of the Interior \n7 \n8  (“DOI”) sent a notice terminating the contract line items through which Defendants HHS and ORR had \n9  provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied children and ordering Plaintiffs to “immediately stop \n10 \nwork” on their ongoing funded representations (the “Cancellation Order”).  Defendants issued this \n11 \norder despite the TVPRA’s mandate that the government provide unaccompanied children with legal \n12 \ncounsel to the greatest extent practicable and despite the existence of congressionally appropriated \n13 \nfunds to pay for precisely these services through at least September 30, 2027.  As a result, many of the \n14 \napproximately 26,000 unaccompanied children around the country represented by attorneys through \n15 \n16  now-terminated  funding  from  Defendants—including  children  with  immigration  court  hearings \n17 \nscheduled for the following business day—were placed at imminent risk of being cut off from their \n18 \nlawyers.  The children subject to this risk include many children now facing imminent removal from \n19 \nthe United States despite being prima facie eligible for immigration relief. \n20 \n12.  The Cancellation Order flies in the face of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  In \n21 \naddition to interrupting and obstructing attorney-client relationships, contrary to the mandate to provide \n22 \n23  legal counsel to unaccompanied children, it also defeats the broader purpose of both the TVPRA and \n24  the Foundational Rule.  Through the funded representations, Plaintiffs play a key role in identifying \n25 \nand helping child trafficking victims, fulfilling one of Congress’s primary objectives in the TVPRA (to \n26 \n“protect [unaccompanied children] from mistreatment, exploitation and trafficking”).  See TVPRA, \n27 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079 (2008).  By subverting Congress’s funding of \n28 \n7 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 190\n\n(215 of 348), Page 215 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 215 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 8a goef  480 of 44\n \n \n1  counsel for unaccompanied children, Defendants ensure more children will remain separated from their \n2 \nfamilies, fewer trafficking victims will be identified and protected, and more children will be at risk of \n3 \nbeing trafficked in the future.   \n4 \n13.  Defendants’ actions will also cause chaos throughout the immigration legal system and \n5 \nare particularly harmful because they come at a time when the government is reinstating expedited \n6 \ndocketing for removal cases for unaccompanied children.  Unaccompanied children across the country \n7 \n8  have immigration court dates this week, at which some will now appear without an attorney.  Other \n9  children have impending deadlines to apply for immigration relief for which they are eligible, but will \n10 \nneed an attorney’s assistance to submit their application.   \n11 \n14.  As a consequence of Defendants ordering Plaintiffs to stop providing direct legal \n12 \nservices, many unaccompanied children will never speak to a lawyer, will never apply for immigration \n13 \nrelief for which they are eligible, will remain in tenuous status for longer, and will not understand what \n14 \nis happening as they are rushed through adversarial removal proceedings.  Immigration judges will be \n15 \n16  left to carry the burden, on their own, to expend limited government resources to educate child \n17 \nrespondents (some only a few months old) on arcane immigration law and apply the law to their cases, \n18 \nwithout a full understanding of the reasons the children left their countries or the realities facing their \n19 \nremoval.  This will cause immigration judges to spend more time on cases for unaccompanied children \n20 \nat a time when the immigration court backlog is already at an all-time high. \n21 \n15.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from ceasing funding for legal representation of \n22 \n23  unaccompanied  children,  an  action  contrary  to  Congress’s  TVPRA  mandate  and  subsequent \n24  congressional funding, contrary to Defendant ORR’s own Foundational Rule on funding for counsel \n25 \nfor unaccompanied children, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n26 \n16.  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, declaring \n27 \nthat Defendants are violating the law and requiring them to continue funding legal representation \n28 \n8 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 191\n\n(216 of 348), Page 216 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 216 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 9a goef  490 of 44\n \n \n1  consistent with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.

This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  alleged  in  this  Complaint  under \n6 \n28 U.S.C. § 1331,  as  they  arise  under  federal  law,  including  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act \n7 \n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 702, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n8 \n9  of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and the 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational \n10  Rule (the “Foundational Rule”), 89 Fed. Reg. 34384. \n11 \n18.  The APA waives the U.S. government’s sovereign immunity where, as here, federal \n12 \nagencies have acted in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in \n13 \nviolation of the law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 \n19.  The Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment \n15 \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n21.  Venue  properly  lies  in  the  Northern  District  of  California  under  28  U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C) because Defendants are “officer[s],” “employee[s],” and “agenc[ies],” of the United \n21 \nStates acting in their official capacities, and because Plaintiffs Community Legal Services in East Palo \n22 \nAlto and Social Justice Collaborative are California non-profit organizations headquartered in and \n23 \n24  providing services in the Northern District.

Plaintiffs \n8 \n23.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that have received funding from Defendants HHS \n9 \n10  and ORR to provide legal representation and other legal services to unaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs \n11  share a mission to expand access to legal information and services for unaccompanied children, and to \n12 \nensure that as many unaccompanied children as possible are represented by a lawyer. \n13 \n24.  Plaintiff Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”) is a nonprofit \n14 \norganization in East Palo Alto, California.  CLSEPA serves unaccompanied children in San Mateo \n15 \nCounty  and  Santa  Clara  County.    Through  funding  from  Defendants,  CLSEPA  provided  legal \n16 \nrepresentation  for  non-detained  unaccompanied  children.    CLSEPA  currently  represents  23 \n17 \n18  unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n19 \n25.  Plaintiff Social Justice Collaborative (“SJC”) is a nonprofit organization in Berkeley, \n20 \nCalifornia, operating across the Bay Area and in California’s central valley—including in areas where \n21 \nit is one of the only organizations offering legal services to immigrants.  It serves unaccompanied \n22 \nchildren  in  San  Francisco  Immigration  Court,  Concord  Immigration  Court,  and  Sacramento \n23 \nImmigration Court.  Through funding from Defendants, SJC provided legal representation to about 45 \n24 \n25  non-detained unaccompanied children per year and hosted Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 193\n\n(218 of 348), Page 218 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 218 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a1g eo f1 410 of 44\n \n \n1  unaccompanied children in the greater Washington, D.C. and Baltimore areas, appearing before the \n2 \nBaltimore,  Hyattsville,  Sterling,  and  Annandale  Immigration  Courts.

Amica Center currently represents more than 850 unaccompanied children in \n6 \ncases formerly funded by Defendants. \n7 \n8  27.  Plaintiff Estrella del Paso (“Estrella”) is a nonprofit organization based in Texas and the \n9  largest provider of free immigration legal services in West Texas and New Mexico.  It serves \n10 \nunaccompanied children appearing before the El Paso Immigration Court and has provided legal \n11 \nservices for unaccompanied children in El Paso since 2007.  Through funding from Defendants, Estrella \n12 \nprovided legal services to indigent, unaccompanied immigrant children who are not in detention, as \n13 \nwell as those in ORR custody in El Paso County, and conducted “know your rights” presentations and \n14 \nindividual consultations.  Estrella currently represents 324 unaccompanied children in cases formerly \n15 \n16  funded by Defendants. \n17 \n28.  Plaintiff Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project (“Florence Project”) is a \n18 \nnonprofit organization in Arizona.  The Florence Project has provided legal services for unaccompanied \n19 \nchildren in Arizona since 2000.  It serves unaccompanied children in Tucson Immigration Court and \n20 \nPhoenix Immigration Court, and in 24 ORR shelters.  Through funding from Defendants, the Florence \n21 \nProject provided legal orientations, legal representation for detained and non-detained unaccompanied \n22 \n23  children, Spanish-language tutoring, and hosting for Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  The Florence \n24  Project is the only non-profit organization that provides free legal services to unaccompanied children \n25 \nin Arizona and currently represents more than 800 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded \n26 \nby Defendants. \n27 \n28 \n11 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 194\n\n(219 of 348), Page 219 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 219 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a2g eo f1 420 of 44\n \n \n1  29.

It serves unaccompanied children in \n3 \nthe Galveston-Houston area and Houston Immigration Court.  Through funding from Defendants, \n4 \nGHIRP provided legal orientations, legal representation for detained and non-detained unaccompanied \n5 \nchildren,  and  hosting  for  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  fellows.    GHIRP  currently  represents  292 \n6 \nunaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n7 \n8  30.  Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center (“ImmDef”) is a nonprofit organization in \n9  Los Angeles, California.  It serves unaccompanied children in three Immigration Courts:  Van Nuys, \n10 \nWest Los Angeles, and Santa Ana.  ImmDef provided legal orientations and direct legal representation \n11 \nthrough funding from Defendants for nearly 2,000 detained and non-detained unaccompanied children, \n12 \nalong with Spanish-language tutoring for attorneys, and hosting for Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  \n13 \nImmDef currently represents nearly 2,000 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by \n14 \nDefendants. \n15 \n16  31.  Plaintiff  National  Immigrant  Justice  Center  (“NIJC”)  is  a  nonprofit  organization \n17 \nheadquartered in Chicago, Illinois and has provided services to unaccompanied children for more than \n18 \n40 years.  It serves unaccompanied children in Chicago Immigration Court.  Through funding from \n19 \nDefendants, NIJC provided legal orientations and individual consultations as well as representation to \n20 \nunaccompanied children in immigration proceedings both in and out of ORR custody.  NIJC currently \n21 \nrepresents approximately 500 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n22 \n23  32.  Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”) is a nonprofit organization \n24  located in Washington State.  It serves unaccompanied children in Seattle Immigration Court (and \n25 \noccasionally Portland Immigration Court), and has provided free immigration legal services for over \n26 \n40 years.  Through funding from Defendants, NWIRP provided legal services to unaccompanied \n27 \nimmigrant children and youth who have been released from ORR custody throughout Washington \n28 \n12 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 195\n\n(220 of 348), Page 220 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 220 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a3g eo f1 430 of 44\n \n \n1  State.  NWIRP currently represents approximately 500 unaccompanied children in cases formerly \n2 \nfunded by Defendants. \n3 \n33.  Plaintiff Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”) is a nonprofit \n4 \norganization in Colorado.  It serves unaccompanied children in Denver Immigration Court.  Through \n5 \nfunding from Defendants, RMIAN provided legal representation for non-detained unaccompanied \n6 \nchildren and Spanish-language tutoring for staff.  RMIAN is the primary organization providing free \n7 \n8  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  children  in  Colorado.    RMIAN  currently  represents  160 \n9  unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n10 \n34.  Plaintiff Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (“VAAP”) is a non-profit organization in \n11 \nVermont.  It serves unaccompanied children in Chelmsford Immigration Court and Boston Immigration \n12 \nCourt.  Through funding from Defendants, VAAP provided legal representation for detained and non-\n13 \ndetained unaccompanied children, and hosting for two Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  VAAP \n14 \nprovides legal services to about 135 unaccompanied children annually, with 35-40 full scope direct \n15 \n16  representations each year.  Serving unaccompanied children in Vermont is particularly urgent because \n17 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont are often unable to access removal proceedings in far-away \n18 \nBoston and Chelmsford without legal assistance—and VAAP is the only legal services provider for \n19 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont. \n20 \n35.  For  years,  Plaintiffs  heeded  Congress’s  call  to  provide  critical  legal  services  to \n21 \nunaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs collectively represent thousands of unaccompanied children, \n22 \n23  including children in removal proceedings and children applying for affirmative forms of immigration \n24  relief, and their organizational missions and ethical obligations compel them to represent these clients \n25 \nto the best of their abilities.  Defendants’ Cancellation Order severely limits Plaintiffs in performing \n26 \ntheir  respective  missions  to  provide  legal  representation  the  law  requires  be  made  available  to \n27 \nunaccompanied children.  To pay for existing representations, Plaintiffs face the need to use up any \n28 \n13 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 196\n\n(221 of 348), Page 221 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 221 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a4g eo f1 440 of 44\n \n \n1  discretionary or reserve funding, and to lay off employees.  If Plaintiffs are unable to maintain staffing \n2 \nlevels necessary to handle their current caseloads, they will have to assess their ability to meet ongoing \n3 \nethical and court-required obligations to their clients and may be forced to withdraw from ongoing \n4 \ncases.   \n5 \n36.  For many Plaintiffs, these consequences are imminent or already occurring.  For \n6 \nexample, ImmDef has already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff to try to stay financially \n7 \n8  viable and able to serve unaccompanied children for as long as possible.  SJC will have to lay off its \n9  three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows if it cannot find other funding.  To maintain its representations, \n10 \nEstrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 employees in its unaccompanied children program.  VAAP \n11 \nhas had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees and may have to furlough another two \n12 \nemployees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee.  In four weeks, GHIRP will have to lay \n13 \noff most of its 19 employees who provide services to unaccompanied children. \n14 \n15 \nB.  Defendants \n16  37.  Defendant HHS is the department of the federal government that receives appropriations \n17 \nfrom  Congress  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligations  under  the  TVPRA  to  aid  and  provide  legal \n18 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent practicable.

HHS And ORR Are Required By Law To Care For Unaccompanied Children. \n10  40.  “Unaccompanied child” is defined by statute as any individual younger than 18 and \n11  without lawful immigration status, who has no parent or legal guardian who is in the United States able \n12 \nto provide care and physical custody.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Once a child is identified as \n13 \nunaccompanied under this definition, they are treated as unaccompanied even if they are later released \n14 \nto  a  sponsor—the  “unaccompanied”  designation  applies  throughout  their  time  navigating  U.S. \n15 \nimmigration law. \n16 \n41.  In the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 100,000 children, toddlers, and babies were identified by \n17 \n18  federal authorities as being unaccompanied children.  These children entered the United States without \n19 \ntheir parents for many reasons, most commonly because they were separated from their parents on their \n20 \nway to the United States, because they were trafficked to the United States, because they were separated \n21 \nfrom their families by immigration authorities after entering the United States, or because they fled \n22 \ntheir home countries without their parents.  A large majority of the children are from Central America \n23 \nand arrived in the United States after a long and dangerous journey north to the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n24 \n25  Many fled unspeakable violence in their home countries and arrived in the United States only to face \n26  detention and deportation on their own.   \n27 \n28 \n15 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 198\n\n(223 of 348), Page 223 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 223 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a6g eo f1 460 of 44\n \n \n1  42.  The United States has long struggled to care for unaccompanied children.  Change has \n2 \ncome as Congress has recognized that unaccompanied children are uniquely vulnerable to trafficking, \n3 \nabuse in government custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system. \n4 \n43.  Until  2002,  the  former  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Services  detained \n5 \nunaccompanied children, treating them similarly to detained noncitizen adults. \n6 \n44.  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 changed this model, giving Defendants HHS and \n7 \n8  ORR legal custody of unaccompanied children, with the mandate to care for these children.  See 6 \n9  U.S.C. § 279(a).   \n10 \n45.  In 2008, the TVPRA imposed further responsibilities on HHS and ORR’s custody of \n11 \nunaccompanied children, including that HHS and ORR “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable \n12 \n. . . that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or \n13 \nmatters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n14 \n15 \nB.  Unaccompanied Children Have Special Legal Rights. \n16  46.  Unaccompanied children have special legal rights, including the right to go through full \n17 \nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge, unlike other individuals who may be put through \n18 \nexpedited removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  If an unaccompanied child applies for \n19 \nasylum, they are entitled to go through the non-adversarial process of an asylum determination through \n20 \nDHS’s Asylum Office—instead of in immigration court, where an immigration judge would preside \n21 \nover an adversarial hearing between a DHS lawyer and the unaccompanied child.  See 8 U.S.C. \n22 \n23  § 1158(b)(3)(C).  Unaccompanied children also have the right to apply for other forms of immigration \n24 \nrelief, like Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, Withholding of Removal, relief under the Convention \n25 \nAgainst Torture, and U or T visas. \n26 \n47.  Although U.S. law guarantees unaccompanied children these rights, the children are not \n27 \nable to avail themselves of these rights unless the children understand their rights, are equipped with \n28 \n16 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 199\n\n(224 of 348), Page 224 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 224 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a7g eo f1 470 of 44\n \n \n1  the tools to exercise them, and are given legal counsel.  For this reason, Congress and ORR have both \n2 \nrecognized the importance of providing unaccompanied children with legal representation—and taken \n3 \nsteps to maximize the number of unaccompanied children represented by attorneys.  The TVPRA \n4 \nrequires Defendants to provide legal representation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent \n5 \npracticable, and Congress has consistently appropriated funds annually to pay for that representation.   \n6 \n48.  And all children (unaccompanied or otherwise) are protected by regulations that prevent \n7 \n8  immigration judges from accepting an admission of removability from respondents under the age of \n9  18—unless the respondent is represented by an attorney or other designated individual.  See 8 C.F.R. \n10 \n1240.10(c). \n11 \n49.  ORR, recognizing its obligations under the TVPRA, committed to providing legal \n12 \nrepresentation to children unable to secure counsel, subject to ORR’s discretion to the extent it \n13 \ndetermines  appropriations  are  available.    ORR  “strives  for  100  percent  legal  representation  of \n14 \nunaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34526 (Apr. 30, 2024). \n15 \n16 \nC.  The TVPRA Requires Defendants to Provide Legal Services to Unaccompanied Children. \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n51.  Acting on this congressional command, ORR contracted with the Vera Institute for \n22 \n23  Justice in 2005 to administer what was then called the “Unaccompanied Children Pro Bono Project” \n24 \n(the “Project”).  The Project was a three-year pilot to develop and test ways to meet the legal needs of \n25 \nunaccompanied children through pro bono legal services.   \n26 \n52.  Through the Project, ORR and Vera collaborated to design a program of subcontracting \n27 \nwith nonprofit legal service organizations to provide basic legal orientation to unaccompanied children, \n28 \n17 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 200\n\n(225 of 348), Page 225 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 225 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a8g eo f1 480 of 44\n \n \n1  to screen their cases to identify those with potential claims for relief from removal, and to recruit and \n2 \ntrain volunteer lawyers to represent children in immigration court.  Initially, the nonprofit legal service \n3 \nproviders were not permitted to use government funding to provide direct representation. \n4 \n53.  At the end of the pilot period in 2008, Vera issued a report to ORR, explaining that \n5 \nvolunteer  attorneys  alone  could  not  represent  all  unaccompanied  children  in  ORR  custody.  \n6 \nAccordingly, the government could not meet its goal of ensuring that a significant percentage of \n7 \n8  unaccompanied children were represented unless it funded attorneys to represent them. \n9  54.  On the heels of this pilot program, Congress imposed additional mandates on ORR and \n10 \nHHS  in  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2008 \n11 \n(“TVPRA”).  The TVPRA mandates HHS to provide counsel for unaccompanied children: \n12 \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n13 \npracticable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the \n14 \ncustody of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not \n15  described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings \nor matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the \n16  greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make every \neffort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to \n17 \nsuch children without charge. \n18 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added). \n19 \n55.  In other words, the TVPRA directs that Defendants “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n20 \npracticable . . .” that unaccompanied children have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings.  If \n21 \nDefendants have funding they can spend to provide counsel for unaccompanied children, they must \n22 \nspend that funding to provide such counsel. \n23 \n24 \nD.

In  2009,  the  House  Appropriations \n25 \nCommittee—following the passage of the TVPRA—explained that “legal representation is absolutely \n26 \ncritical to ensure that children understand their rights as they navigate the legal process to determine \n27 \ntheir status in the United States.”  H. Rep. 111-220, at 165.  The Committee commended the earlier \n28 \n19 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 202\n\n(227 of 348), Page 227 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 227 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a0g eo f2 400 of 44\n \n \n1  pilot program for legal representation for unaccompanied children and included funding “to continue \n2 \nand expand this initiative” “to work towards ensuring that all unaccompanied alien children understand \n3 \ntheir legal rights and have access to pro bono representation.”  Id. at 165-66.  But success of this \n4 \nprogram to match unaccompanied children with volunteer attorneys was highly dependent on local \n5 \ncircumstances, and it was clear pro bono representation alone could not meet the representational needs \n6 \nof unaccompanied children. \n7 \n8  58.  Beginning in 2012, funding became available to pay lawyers dedicated to representing \n9  unaccompanied children, in addition to referring them to pro bono counsel.   \n10 \n59.  Over time, ORR and Congress have directed that funded representation be expanded \n11 \nagain and again.  In reports accompanying appropriations bills, Congress has built on its mandates for \n12 \nfunded legal representation for unaccompanied children over the years.  For example, in 2018 the \n13 \nSenate Appropriations Committee noted “that services provided by qualified and independent legal \n14 \ncounsel to [unaccompanied children] can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of immigration \n15 \n16  proceedings and significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS \n17 \ncustody. The Committee recommendation directs ORR to continue the scope and funding of these legal \n18 \nservices at no less than fiscal year 2017 levels.”  S. Rep. 115-289, at 150.  \n19 \n60.  In  2019,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  directed  funding  specifically  for \n20 \n“qualified and independent legal services for unaccompanied children, including but not limited to \n21 \nknow-your- rights orientations, legal screenings, court preparation and assistance, representation, and \n22 \n23  pro bono referrals” and recommended expanding funded representations.  H. Rep. 116-62 at 145 \n24  (emphasis added).   \n25 \n61.  In 2020, the House Appropriations Committee recommended “no less than $30,000,000 \n26 \nto be spent in fiscal year 2021 for direct representation services to children” and encouraged “ORR \n27 \n28 \n20 \n \n\n(228 of 348), Page 228 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 228 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a1g eo f2 410 of 44\n \n \n1  to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to minimize the risks of any child having to \n2 \ngo to immigration court without independent legal counsel.”  H. Rep. 116-450 at 180 (emphasis added).   \n3 \n62.  In 2021, the House Appropriations Committee again supported funded representations, \n4 \ninstructing that there should be even more funded representation for unaccompanied children released \n5 \nfrom ORR custody and that such direct representation “shall be made available to children up to the \n6 \nfunded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-96, at 211 (emphasis added). \n7 \n8  63.  In  2022,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  again  supported  “the  continued \n9  expansion  of  independent  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  children”  and  directed  that  funded \n10 \nrepresentations should “be made available to children up to funded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-403, at \n11 \n200 (emphasis added). \n12 \n64.  Until March 21, 2025, the Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”) managed a network of \n13 \n89 legal services organizations (including Plaintiffs) in 159 offices across the country providing \n14 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children through funding from HHS and ORR, under a contract \n15 \n16  between Acacia and DOI (contracting on behalf of HHS and ORR). \n17 \n65.  This contract had four funded line items: \n18 \n1.  Work in ORR shelter facilities, including “know your rights” presentations, intakes to \n19 \nconnect detained children with attorneys, and initial screenings with detained children; \n20 \n2.  Full legal representation for children in and out of ORR custody, as well as other non-\n21 \nrepresentation services such as “friend of court” services in hearings for unaccompanied \n22 \n23  children appearing in immigration court or preparing forms without attorneys; \n24  3.

As of March 21, 2025, Plaintiffs and other attorneys across the country represented \n2 \napproximately 26,000 children, toddlers, and babies—who arrived in the U.S. without parents or other \n3 \ncaregivers—through funding appropriated by Congress and delivered under this contract. \n4 \nE.  Past  Government  Statements  Acknowledge  The  Benefits  Of  Funding  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children and Babies \n6 \n67.  The importance of legal representation for unaccompanied children is borne out in \n7 \nimmigration court statistics.  Increasing representation for unaccompanied children makes immigration \n8 \ncourts run more efficiently, leads to more unaccompanied children who qualify for immigration relief \n9 \nreceiving that relief, and leads to more unaccompanied children without a case for relief requesting \n10 \n11  voluntary departure instead of unnecessary proceedings. \n12  68.  Unrepresented  children  effectively  never  receive  relief  from  removal.    A  2024 \n13 \nCongressional Research Service report explained that from 2005 to 2017, 90% of unaccompanied \n14 \nchildren in removal proceedings without a lawyer were removed and less than 1% received some form \n15 \nof immigration relief (only 308 children out of nearly 90,000).  See “Unaccompanied Alien Children: \n16 \nAn Overview,” CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (Sept. 5, 2024), https://www.congress.gov/crs-\n17 \nproduct/R43599.  On the other hand, only 21% of represented unaccompanied children received a \n18 \n19  removal order over the same time period, and 73% attain some form of relief, including asylum and \n20 \nother paths to lawful permanent resident status.  Moreover, a greater percentage of unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren with attorneys chose to depart the country voluntarily than those without lawyers, showing the \n22 \nrole attorneys play in helping children understand both their options and—in some circumstances—\n23 \ntheir lack of options. \n24 \n69.  Represented children are also more likely to attend their hearings than unrepresented \n25 \n26  children, and more likely to understand what happens in their cases, easing the burden on immigration \n27  judges to explain proceedings.  From 2005 to 2017, 76% of all unaccompanied children continued to \n28 \nappear as scheduled for their cases—but for represented unaccompanied children, that rate was a near-\n22 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 205\n\n(230 of 348), Page 230 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 230 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a3g eo f2 430 of 44\n \n \n1  perfect 97%.

ORR has acknowledged “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to \n5 \nresolve their immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both \n6 \nthe court appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \n7 \n8  Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed.

Immigration Judges And Other Government Officials Regularly Praise Plaintiffs’ Work, \n11  Which Makes Their Jobs Easier \n12  71.  In the past weeks, immigration judges have expressed their concern that Plaintiffs might \n13 \nno longer be working in their courtrooms and helping courts function smoothly.  Plaintiff Community \n14 \nLegal Services in East Palo Alto prioritizes positive interactions with immigration judges and adopts a \n15 \nproactive approach to advocacy, working with ICE counsel to ensure that their clients can advance \n16 \ntheir cases without missing school—a benefit to everyone involved. \n17 \n72.  A judge in Chicago Immigration Court specifically expressed her concern that NIJC \n18 \n19  might not be available anymore to represent unaccompanied children appearing before her.  Judges \n20 \npraise NIJC’s work as allowing the court to operate efficiently and with confidence that unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren are making informed decisions and have been screened for relief and other needs. \n22 \n73.  Plaintiff the Florence Project was created after a call to action by an immigration judge.  \n23 \nThe Florence Project works with the court and individual judges to coordinate the specialized docket \n24 \nfor unaccompanied children, serving as friend of the court frequently.  Judges show their appreciation \n25 \n26  for the Florence Project’s work by giving its staff space in courtrooms to conduct pre-hearing \n27  orientations for children and even by swearing in Florence Project staff who have just been admitted \n28 \n23 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 206\n\n(231 of 348), Page 231 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 231 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-20     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 44\n \n \n1  to the Arizona Bar.  In stakeholder meetings with the government, government partners routinely thank \n2 \nthe Florence Project for its work and emphasize the value of the services it provides. \n3 \n74.  Immigration  judges  and  other  stakeholders  rely  on  Amica  Center’s  services.  \n4 \nImmigration judges rely on Amica Center’s friend of court services and ask Amica Center to enter \n5 \nappearances in cases where the judge doubts the child understands their legal options or is competent \n6 \nto appear in court.  ORR shelter staff lean on Amica Center to answer questions about court appearances \n7 \n8  for the children they house. \n9  75.  Immigration judges overseeing dedicated dockets for unaccompanied children in El \n10 \nPaso express gratitude for the work Estrella does both in its representations and its friend of court \n11 \nservices.  Judges appreciate that Estrella helps them reduce their docket loads.  ORR shelter staff \n12 \nappreciate Estrella’s help and training in caring for unaccompanied children. \n13 \n76.  Immigration judges and government attorneys regularly thank RMIAN for its work, and \n14 \nRMIAN and government employees work together to improve immigration court efficiency in Denver.  \n15 \n16  RMIAN saves the court and the government unnecessary time and effort by obtaining dismissal in \n17 \ncases where dismissal is proper and by avoiding unnecessary status hearings.  The Denver Immigration \n18 \nCourt regularly asks RMIAN to provide friend of court services to assist unaccompanied children with \n19 \nanything from a change of address form to a screening for potential human trafficking.   \n20 \n77.  Judges, clerks, and other immigration court staff, and DHS field office staff praise \n21 \nVAAP’s work as making the immigration legal system more fair and efficient.  VAAP’s services help \n22 \n23  immigration courts avoid unnecessary proceedings and help unaccompanied children efficiently appear \n24  in court remotely. \n25 \nG.  In  2024,  ORR  Issued  A  Foundational  Rule  On  Funding  For  Legal  Services  For \n26  Unaccompanied Children \n27  78.  On  April  30,  2024,  ORR  issued  a  final  rule  following  full  notice-and-comment \n28 \nrulemaking:  the “Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule,” which took effect July 1, \n24 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 207\n\n(232 of 348), Page 232 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 232 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 25 of 40\n \n \n1  2024.  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, \n2 \n2024) (to be codified at 4 C.F.R. pt. 410).  The rule is meant to codify regulations “consistent with \n3 \nORR’s statutory duties” and “responsibilities for coordinating and implement the care and placement \n4 \nof unaccompanied children . . . under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the [TVPRA].”  \n5 \nId., 89 CFR 34384.   \n6 \n79.  Section 410.1309 of the Foundational Rule is titled “Legal Services.”  Id., 89 Fed. Reg. \n7 \n8  34526.  This section of the Foundational Rule affirms ORR’s belief that “legal services providers who \n9  represent unaccompanied children undertake an important function” and stated, “ORR strives for 100 \n10 \npercent legal representation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to \n11 \nthe extent possible.”  Id.   \n12 \n80.  The Foundational Rule requires that unaccompanied children in ORR custody must \n13 \nreceive a legal orientation from “an independent legal service provider” and a “confidential legal \n14 \nconsultation with a qualified attorney.”  Id., 89 CFR 34603.   \n15 \n16  81.  The rule also provides that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund legal \n17 \nservice  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain  unaccompanied \n18 \nchildren.”  Id.   \n19 \n82.  To comply with the TVPRA and INA, the rule recognizes ORR must “ensure that all \n20 \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \n21 \n“ORR may make grants, in its discretion and subject to available resources . . . or contracts under this \n22 \n23  section . . . for the purpose of providing immigration legal representation, assistance and related \n24  services to unaccompanied children.”  Id.   \n25 \nH.  In  2024,  Congress  Reauthorized  Funding  For  The  Services,  And  That  Funding  Is \n26  Available Today  \n27  83.  On  March  23,  2024,  Congress  passed  H.R.  2882,  the  Further  Consolidated \n28 \nAppropriations Act of 2024, which appropriated funding for many federal departments and programs, \n25 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 208\n\n(233 of 348), Page 233 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 233 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a6g eo f2 460 of 44\n \n \n1  including Defendants HHS and ORR.  Congress specifically appropriated funds “for carrying out . . . \n2 \nsection 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008,” \n3 \nthe TVPRA.  Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664.  Section 235 of the TVPRA includes the requirement \n4 \nto provide funding for counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable”—so the \n5 \nappropriation was, in part, meant to pay for this representation.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n6 \n84.  The Senate Report accompanying the 2024 appropriations bill commanded Defendant \n7 \n8  HHS to fund the Services.  The Senate Committee on Appropriations specified there should be \n9  “$5,506,258,000 for the Unaccompanied Children [UC] program.”  S. Rep. 118-84, at 167.  It went on \n10 \nto direct, “The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2023 funding level for \n11 \npost-release services; legal services and access to counsel; and child advocates.  The Committee \n12 \nexpects HHS will continue to expand child-welfare focused post-release services . . . including . . . \n13 \naccess to legal services.”  Id. at 168. \n14 \n85.  The Senate Report expressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund \n15 \n16  counsel for unaccompanied children:  “The Committee also expects these funds will be used to provide \n17 \naccess to counsel, consistent with the goals of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n18 \nof 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration proceedings.”  Id. at 169 \n19 \n(emphasis added). \n20 \n86.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the levels set in the Further \n21 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \n22 \n23  Pub. L. 119-4, div. A tit. I sec. 1101(8) (2025). \n24  87.  This appropriated funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is now available to \n25 \nDefendants through September 30, 2027.  The initial 2024 appropriation extended for two years, \n26 \nthrough September 30, 2026, Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664, and the Full-Year Continuing \n27 \nAppropriations and Extensions Act of 2025 further extended the appropriation by another year, Pub. \n28 \n26 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 209\n\n(234 of 348), Page 234 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 234 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a7g eo f2 470 of 44\n \n \n1  L. 119-4, div.

Defendants  Abruptly  Shut  Down  And  Later  Resumed  Funding  For  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children Without Explanation \n6 \n88.  Despite  Congress’s  consistent  funding  of  legal  representation  for  unaccompanied \n7 \nchildren, consistent with the TVPRA, Defendants seek to undermine congressional appropriations and \n8 \nthe TVPRA’s mandate.  On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, without warning, Defendant DOI and \n9 \nDefendant  HHS  issued  a  “Stop  Work  Order”  to  Acacia,  ordering  service  providers—including \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs—to “cease all services” and “stop all work” for those services under the contract between \n12  Acacia and DOI.  The order included no end date; it indefinitely suspended the services.  The stop work \n13 \norder gave no explanation, but said it had nothing to do with how the legal services were being run: \n14 \n“The stop work order is being implemented due to causes outside of [Acacia’s] control and should not \n15 \nbe misconstrued as an indication of poor performance by [Acacia].”  Nevertheless, the order explained, \n16 \nthe stop work order could lead Defendants to “terminate the contract.”    \n17 \n89.  Three  days  later,  and  after  significant  backlash,  on  Friday,  February  21,  2025, \n18 \n19  Defendants voluntarily rescinded the stop work order without explanation.   \n20 \nJ.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators Reminded Defendants That Ending Funding For Counsel \n21  For Unaccompanied Children Violates the TVPRA \n22  90.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and DOI \n23  Secretary Doug Burgum to express their “strong opposition” to the now-rescinded stop work order and \n24 \nto note their “concern[] about the chaos and confusion it caused for legal services providers and the \n25 \nchildren they serve.”  Sens. Ossoff, Hirono, et al, Letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and \n26 \nSecretary  Doug  Burgum  (Mar.  3,  2025),  accessible  at  https://www.hirono.senate.gov/ \n27 \nimo/media/doc/250305lettertohhsandinterioronlegalservicesforchildreninimmigrationsystem.pdf.   \n28 \n27 \n \n\n(235 of 348), Page 235 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 235 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-20     Filed 03/27/25     Page 28 of 44\n \n \n1  91.  The Senators explained that the stop work order—and any other attempt to stop funding \n2 \ncounsel for unaccompanied children—is a violation of the TVPRA: “Pausing or terminating the \n3 \nprovision of legal services to unaccompanied children under this contract runs directly counter \n4 \nto the requirements of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and \n5 \nplaces 26,000 unaccompanied children at increased risk of trafficking, exploitation, and other harm. \n6 \nThe TVPRA, passed by Congress in 2008 on a bipartisan basis, requires the Department of Health and \n7 \n8  Human Services (HHS) to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that all unaccompanied children \n9  have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, \n10 \nand trafficking. Shirking this statutory mandate heightens the risk of harm for these uniquely vulnerable \n11 \nchildren.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n12 \n92.  The  Senators  went  on  to  explain  that  representation  makes  it  more  likely  that \n13 \nunaccompanied children will appear at their hearings, less likely that the government will lose track of \n14 \nunaccompanied children, and less likely that the unaccompanied children will be trafficked.  Id. at  2. \n15 \n16  93.  The Senators requested a briefing from Defendants about why the stop work order was \n17 \nissued and Defendants’ “plan for compliance with your statutory mandate to ensure that children have \n18 \ncounsel in immigration proceedings.”  Id. \n19 \n94.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any response from Defendants to the Senators. \n20 \n21  K.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants Again Stopped Funding Counsel for Unaccompanied \nChildren \n22 \n95.  Although  Defendants  rescinded  their  February  18,  2025  stop  work  order,  they \n23 \napparently continued to look for ways to avoid the TVPRA’s and Foundational Rule’s requirement that \n24 \nthey fund legal representation for unaccompanied children.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent \n25 \n26  a letter titled “Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” to Acacia (the \n27  “Cancellation Order”).  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for contract \n28 \nline items two through four:  legal representation for unaccompanied children—both in and out of \n28 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 211\n\n(236 of 348), Page 236 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 236 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 29 of 40\n \n \n1  detention—and other legal services like “friend of court” assistance in pro se matters, Immigrant \n2 \nJustice Corps fellows, and Spanish-language tutoring.  The letter further commanded Acacia and \n3 \nPlaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on these representations. \n4 \n96.  On information and belief, Defendants have no plans to fund any legal representation \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children—whether by reinstating the cancelled contract line items or by finding \n6 \nalternative ways to pay lawyers to represent unaccompanied children.   \n7 \n8  97.  The Cancellation Order took effect at close of business on Friday, March 21, 2025, and \n9  Plaintiffs represent clients with immigration court hearings that were scheduled for Monday March 24, \n10 \n2025—the very next business day.  Yet Plaintiffs received no guidance from Defendants regarding how \n11 \nthose representations should continue—forcing them to choose between seeking to withdraw from their \n12 \nrepresentations or attempting to continue representing their clients unfunded.  Their clients are at risk \n13 \nof losing access to the legal counsel provided by the TVPRA and Foundational Rule.    \n14 \n15 \nL.  Defendants’ Termination Of Funding To Represent Unaccompanied Children Frustrates \nPlaintiffs’  Missions,  Causes  Plaintiffs  Irreparable  Harm,  and  Serves  No  Legitimate \n16 \nPurpose. \n17 \n98.  Terminating funding for attorneys to represent unaccompanied children has devastating \n18 \nand irreparable effects, even more so for the harm it does to unaccompanied children.  Even if \n19 \nDefendants reinstate funding for counsel for unaccompanied children at some unknown future time (an \n20 \nunlikely supposition), the funded representations, the non-profits and attorneys that administer them, \n21 \nand the unaccompanied children that receive vital counsel from them already will have been dealt an \n22 \n23  irreparable blow.   \n24 \n99.  Defendants’  actions  will  cause  Plaintiffs  to  lay  off  employees  and  lose  huge \n25 \npercentages  of  their  overall  funding.    For  Plaintiffs,  the  funding  Congress  has  consistently \n26 \nappropriated to provide services under the TVPRA is existentially important.   \n27 \n28 \n29 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 212\n\n(237 of 348), Page 237 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 237 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a0g eo f3 400 of 44\n \n \n1  100.  For example, funding for the services Defendants have illegally cancelled makes up \n2 \napproximately 55% of ImmDef’s budget and pays for 113 of ImmDef’s approximately 200 employees.  \n3 \nThe cancelled funding made up nearly half of VAAP’s and GHIRP’s operating budgets, 30% of Amica \n4 \nCenter’s budget, over 25% of NIJC’s budget, 15% of RMIAN’s budget, and 10% of NWIRP’s budget.  \n5 \nThe Florence Project received about $12 million a year from the now-cancelled funding, which \n6 \nsupported more than 100 employees. \n7 \n8  101.  Many organizations will have to lay off staff.  SJC will soon have to lay off its three \n9  Immigrant Justice Corps fellows unless it can find another source of funding for their salaries, ImmDef \n10 \nhas already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff, Estrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 \n11 \nemployees in its unaccompanied children program, GHIRP will have to lay off most of its 19 children’s \n12 \nprogram staff in four weeks, and VAAP has had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees, \n13 \nand may have to furlough another two employees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee. \n14 \n15  102.  Because Plaintiffs’ mission is to serve unaccompanied children, they will incur \n16  huge losses to keep doing so.  Plaintiffs’ ethical responsibilities to their clients and commitment to \n17 \ntheir mission of serving as many unaccompanied children as possible mean that Plaintiffs cannot simply \n18 \ncut off services and representations for unaccompanied children.  The organizations will hold on for as \n19 \nlong as they can without funding from Defendants, but the impacts will be harsh whether they are \n20 \nimmediate or sightly delayed. \n21 \n103.  For  example,  CLSEPA  has  had  to  stop  taking  on  new  clients,  even  if  they  are \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children in removal proceedings without an attorney.  CLSEPA is seeking new funding \n24  to continue existing representations of unaccompanied children, but is faced with the risk of having to \n25 \nwithdraw from ongoing representations—which is entirely antithetical to CLSEPA’s mission to serve \n26 \nimmigrants in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. \n27 \n28 \n30 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 213\n\n(238 of 348), Page 238 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 238 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a1g eo f3 410 of 44\n \n \n1  104.  SJC is facing the prospect of having to lay off three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows \n2 \nwho represent unaccompanied children and may be forced to try to find other organizations that can \n3 \ntake on their clients. \n4 \n105.  Estrella faces a budget deficit of more than $200,000 per month to maintain its services \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children without funding from Defendants.  To continue representing the 324 \n6 \nunaccompanied children clients it took on in reliance on funding from Defendants, Estrella will have \n7 \n8  to operate at this significant deficit, threatening Estrella’s other programming.  Once Estrella’s reserves \n9  are depleted, it will likely not be able to offer free legal representation in many circumstances. \n10 \n106.  The  Florence  Project  is  drawing  on  general  funds  to  sustain  its  services  for \n11 \nunaccompanied children but will likely have to conduct significant layoffs of its team of more than 100 \n12 \nemployees who are dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Still, the Florence Project is \n13 \ndetermined to continue its representations of more than 800 unaccompanied children—even without \n14 \nthe funding it relied on when it entered into the representations—though it will cost the organization \n15 \n16  significantly to continue this work. \n17 \n107.  To support their existing Immigrant Children and Youth staff, GHIRP will have to rely \n18 \non  unrestricted  funds  and  savings,  destabilizing  the  organization  as  a  whole.  This  will  divert \n19 \nunrestricted funds away from other services, as these resources typically cover gaps in funding between \n20 \ncontract cycles on other grants, underfunded programs, or new initiatives that are responsive to \n21 \nemerging needs in their community. \n22 \n23  108.  ImmDef has 1,900 cases that were funded by Defendants.  ImmDef estimates its reserve \n24  funding will be exhausted within 6 months, and to hang on that long it will have to dramatically cut its \n25 \nstaffing.  Just to position itself to survive in the short-term, ImmDef has had to lay off 27 staff.  Once \n26 \nImmDef’s  reserves  run  out,  it  will  have  to  terminate  all  113  staff  formerly  funded  by  money \n27 \nappropriated by Congress to provide services under the TVPRA.  As ImmDef has to cut staff, it will \n28 \n31 \n \n\n(239 of 348), Page 239 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 239 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a2g eo f3 420 of 44\n \n \n1  be unable to reallocate its 1,900 formerly funded cases to other attorneys—so it will be unable to \n2 \ncompetently represent existing unaccompanied child clients. \n3 \n109.  NWIRP will have to spend at least $200,000 per month to sustain its services for \n4 \nunaccompanied children that were previously funded by Defendants. \n5 \n110.  NIJC is transferring employees away from its children’s services to try to make it \n6 \nfeasible to maintain a limited staff to attempt to sustain existing representations. \n7 \n8  111.  RMIAN will have to draw from its financial reserves and the limited funding it receives \n9  that is not pre-allocated for restricted purposes to delay layoffs, and it cannot provide long-term \n10 \nassurances to its clients that they will not be left without lawyers if RMIAN cannot afford to keep its \n11 \nunaccompanied children staff employed. \n12 \n112.  VAAP’s remaining staff of three are stretched as they try to continue to support their \n13 \nclients.  Two of those three may soon need to be furloughed, leaving only one attorney for all of \n14 \nVAAP’s clients. \n15 \n16  113.  Every harm to their clients is a severe harm to Plaintiffs’ mission to help their \n17 \nclients.  Plaintiffs’ clients are significantly harmed by the uncertainty they now face, as Plaintiffs may \n18 \nbe forced to withdraw from ongoing representations.  The cases Plaintiffs took on in reliance on funding \n19 \nfrom Defendants are complex and often take years to resolve, and clients will be harmed if they are no \n20 \nlonger represented by Plaintiffs.   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n32 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 215\n\n(240 of 348), Page 240 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 240 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a3g eo f3 430 of 44\n \n \n1  attorneys remaining on staff to represent him at his interview when it is scheduled, and ImmDef is \n2 \nhelpless to provide him any assurances. \n3 \n115.  In representations formerly funded by Defendants, SJC represents—for example—three \n4 \nindividuals not in active removal proceedings, with strong cases for affirmative immigration relief that \n5 \nwould allow them to stay in the country.  None of these clients could afford to hire a lawyer, but with \n6 \nfree representation from SJC each has a clear path to relief.  If SJC cannot continue to represent them, \n7 \n8  they will be unlikely to secure the relief they qualify for. \n9  116.  The Amica Center represents a four-year-old boy from Haiti in a case formerly funded \n10 \nby Defendants.  The four-year-old has a hearing in the process of obtaining SIJS relief on April 2, 2025.  \n11 \nHe also has an immigration court hearing in early June.  Without an attorney, the four-year-old could \n12 \nnot engage in these proceedings or obtain any of the immigration relief for which he is eligible.  The \n13 \nAmica Center is continuing to represent him and its other unaccompanied child clients, though \n14 \ncontinuing its now-unfunded representations is very costly to the organization. \n15 \n16  117.  The Florence Project currently represents a set of three siblings who fled their home \n17 \ncountry after their mother died and their sister was murdered.  All three siblings have pending asylum \n18 \napplications and are in the process of obtaining SIJS relief.  Both the asylum and SIJS processes require \n19 \ncomplex legal work, and the siblings would have little hope of obtaining relief without an attorney.  \n20 \nWere the three to lose their Florence Project lawyer—previously funded by Defendants—they would \n21 \nbe severely harmed, a result antithetical to the Florence Project’s mission. \n22 \n23  118.  Defendants’ illegal actions prevent Plaintiffs pursuing their missions.  Because \n24  Plaintiffs’ missions are founded on the belief that no child should face a trained government prosecutor \n25 \nalone,  Plaintiffs  also  suffer  significant  harms  to  their  missions  because  without  funding  from \n26 \nDefendants, they cannot take on new clients.  Every unaccompanied child in ORR custody who needs \n27 \nbut does not receive representation because Defendants have ceased funding legal representation under \n28 \n33 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 216\n\n(241 of 348), Page 241 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 241 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a4g eo f3 440 of 44\n \n \n1  the TVPRA is a harm to Plaintiffs, as organizations that exist to serve these children and to ensure as \n2 \nfew as possible go without a lawyer.  Unrepresented children will be unable to apply for voluntary \n3 \ndeparture to return home, children who have been trafficked will be unable to access the protections \n4 \nafforded to them by U.S. law, and children with strong cases for asylum who fled persecution in their \n5 \nhome countries will be unable to apply for asylum.  These impacts are unacceptable for Plaintiffs. \n6 \n119.  If Plaintiffs are forced to shut down or stop providing services to unaccompanied \n7 \n8  children entirely, these mission harms will be even more acute because entire populations will be left \n9  unserved.  For example, SJC serves remote areas of California’s central valley where there are few \n10 \nother  resources  for  unaccompanied  children,  VAAP  is  the  only  legal  service  provider  for \n11 \nunaccompanied  children  in  Vermont,  RMIAN  is  the  primary  free  legal  service  provider  for \n12 \nunaccompanied children in Colorado, and for the majority of unaccompanied children in ORR custody \n13 \nin Arizona, the Florence Project represents their only access to counsel and only opportunity to receive \n14 \nfree legal representation. \n15 \n16  120.  Defendants’ illegal actions are also causing collateral harm to other parts of \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ missions.  While work serving unaccompanied children is a large portion of what most \n18 \nPlaintiffs do, many Plaintiffs also serve other immigrant populations—but Defendants’ illegal refusal \n19 \nto fund legal representation has knock-on effects that harm all of Plaintiffs’ efforts and other missions. \n20 \n121.  The Florence Project has had to institute a hiring freeze and cannot fill twenty open \n21 \npositions that would be dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Because the Florence Project is \n22 \n23  having to use general funding to maintain its representations of unaccompanied children, it has also \n24  had to freeze hirings in all non-unaccompanied-children service areas across the organization, limiting \n25 \nits ability to carry out other elements of its mission to provide legal services to immigrants. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n34 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 217\n\n(242 of 348), Page 242 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 242 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 35 of 40\n \n \n1  122.  As GHIRP draws down its savings to continue serving its unaccompanied child clients, \n2 \nthe financial strain threatens its other programming, which also relies on GHIRP maintaining funds to \n3 \ncover gaps in funding for those other programs. \n4 \n123.  For ImmDef, transferring funds from other efforts to try to sustain legal representations \n5 \nof unaccompanied children for as long as possible will mean cutting back on other services it planned \n6 \nto provide for immigrants, including pro se clinics.  ImmDef has also had to stop providing any non-\n7 \n8  essential support for its clients (like paying for medical exams required for certain adjustment of status \n9  applications), though its mission is to support its clients as much as possible.  And ImmDef has had to \n10 \nfreeze all hiring across its organization, hampering its ability to fulfill its overall mission of providing \n11 \nlegal services to immigrants. \n12 \n124.  NWIRP is being forced to draw from its reserves, at the expense of using that money \n13 \nfor the other services it provides immigrants in Washington state. \n14 \n125.  RMIAN will be forced to dedicate its already-limited staff time to fundraise to try to \n15 \n16  cover the gap left by the cancelled funding.  RMIAN is concerned that its staff might take other jobs \n17 \nwith organizations that are more securely funded. \n18 \n126.  Because VAAP is a small organization, its remaining staff of three has struggled to keep \n19 \nup its legal work and field client questions, and has been unable to engage in basic administrative work \n20 \nto keep the organization running. \n21 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n23  Not in Accordance with Law \n24  127.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n25  herein.  \n26 \n128.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) authorizes this Court to set aside agency \n27 \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \n28 \n35 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 218\n\n(243 of 348), Page 243 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 243 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a6g eo f3 460 of 44\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ cancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied \n2 \nchildren violates the TVPRA. \n3 \n129.  The TVPRA requires Defendants HHS and ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent \n4 \npracticable . . . that all unaccompanied . . . children who are or have been in the custody of [Defendants \n5 \nHHS and ORR] . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them \n6 \nfrom mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  This language in the TVPRA \n7 \n8  is and has been understood to require Defendants HHS and ORR to fund attorneys to represent \n9  unaccompanied children.   \n10 \n130.  Congress has consistently and specifically appropriated funds to Defendants HHS and \n11 \nORR to provide services required by the TVPRA, including funding legal representation.  These \n12 \ncongressionally appropriated funds remain available to Defendants to pay for legal representation \n13 \nthrough September 30, 2027.  \n14 \n131.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants terminated the contract line items that funded legal \n15 \n16  representation under the TVPRA.  On information and belief, Defendants are not funding the required \n17 \nlegal representations for unaccompanied children in any other way.  Instead, the Cancellation Order \n18 \nends government-funded legal representation for unaccompanied children despite the availability of \n19 \nappropriated funding for such representations through at least September 30, 2027—two-and-a-half \n20 \nyears from now. \n21 \n132.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n22 \n23  availability of appropriated funds for this purpose, Defendants violate the TVPRA’s mandate to provide \n24  counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable.”  Funds remain available for \n25 \nthis purpose, and Defendants are subverting congressional appropriations and the TVPRA by failing to \n26 \nfund legal representation for unaccompanied children. \n27 \n28 \n36 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 219\n\n(244 of 348), Page 244 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 244 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a7g eo f3 470 of 44\n \n \n1  133.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is \n2 \nnot in accordance with the TVPRA, it is “not in accordance with law” within the meaning of the APA \n3 \nand should be set aside. \n4 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \nAccardi Doctrine \n6 \n134.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n7 \nherein.  \n8 \n9  135.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n10  an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ \n11 \ncancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied children violates the APA under the \n12 \nAccardi Doctrine because it violates ORR’s own policies and regulations. \n13 \n136.  Longstanding Supreme Court caselaw mandates that agencies must adhere to their own \n14 \npolicies and regulations, and that failure to do so violates the APA.  See U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. \n15 \nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds; see also Alcaraz v. \n16 \n17  I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The legal proposition that agencies may be required to \n18 \nabide by certain internal policies is well-established.”).   \n19 \n137.  The  2024  Unaccompanied  Children  Program  Foundational  Rule  requires  the \n20 \ngovernment to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation” to \n21 \nunaccompanied children if there are “available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal \n22 \norientation, consultation with a lawyer, and ongoing access to lawyers.  89 CFR 34604.   \n23 \n24  138.  The ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Policy Guide expressly states that \n25  “ORR funds legal service providers (LSPs) to provide direct immigration legal representation or \n26 \nrepresentation in non-immigration related matters to the extent of available appropriations, and insofar \n27 \nas it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  See “ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children \n28 \n37 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 220\n\n(245 of 348), Page 245 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 245 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a8g eo f3 480 of 44\n \n \n1  Bureau Policy Guide: Section 3.7.2 Direct Legal Representation,” OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT \n2 \n(revised Aug. 1, 2024), https://acf.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-\n3 \nguide-section-3#3.7.2. \n4 \n139.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n5 \navailability of appropriated funds for this purpose through at least September 30, 2027, Defendants \n6 \nviolate the Foundational Rule’s mandate to provide counsel for unaccompanied children to the extent \n7 \n8  there are appropriated funds available to do so and violate ORR’s policy of funding legal service \n9  providers “to the extent of available appropriations.”  Defendants’ violations of ORR’s own rule and \n10 \npolicy violate the APA. \n11 \n140.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children \n12 \nviolates the Foundational Rule and ORR’s own Policy Guide, it violates the APA and should be set \n13 \naside under the Accardi Doctrine as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion [and] otherwise not \n14 \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n15 \n16  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n17 \nArbitrary and Capricious \n18 \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n19 \nherein.  \n20 \n142.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n21 \nan abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n22 \n143.  Defendants  have  given  no  reasoned  justification  for  their  abrupt  cancellation  of \n23 \n24  mandated  and  appropriated  funding  for  legal  representations  for  unaccompanied  children.    The \n25  Cancellation Order gives no reasoning at all.  And the February stop work order expressly disclaimed \n26 \nthat it was issued for any “poor performance” of the legal representations. \n27 \n28 \n38 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 221\n\n(246 of 348), Page 246 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 246 of 348\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a9g eo f3 490 of 44\n \n \n1  144.  There is significant evidence that providing legal representation improves efficiency in \n2 \nimmigration court and conserves immigration court time and resources.  Cancelling funding for legal \n3 \nrepresentation will only make immigration courts operate less efficiently. \n4 \n145.  In addition, Defendants’ unlawful cancellation of funding for legal representations \n5 \ndirectly  undermines  Plaintiff  organizations’  missions  to  provide  representation  for  as  many \n6 \nunaccompanied children as possible.  Defendants have “entirely failed to consider an important aspect \n7 \n8  of the problem” by failing to consider the impact to Plaintiffs and their clients.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \n9  Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n10 \n146.  Because Defendants’ termination of the Programs is arbitrary and capricious, Plaintiffs \n11 \nask that the Court set aside Defendants’ actions as violative of the APA. \n12 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n14 \n1.  Declare  that  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  APA  because  they  are  “arbitrary, \n15 \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in violation of the law.” \n16 \n17  2.  Declare  that  Defendants  are  required  to  continue  funding  legal  representation  to \n18 \nunaccompanied children, consistent with the TVPRA and ORR’s Foundational Rule. \n19 \n3.  Set aside Defendants’ actions that violate the APA. \n20 \n4.  Enjoin  Defendants  nationwide  from  ceasing  to  fund  counsel  to  represent \n21 \nunaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule. \n22 \n5.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \n23 \n24  Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and  \n25  6.

INTRODUCTION \n2  The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ extraordinary request for a temporary restraining order and \n3  preliminary  injunction,  ECF  No.  7  (“motion”).  Plaintiffs’  motion  is  legally  unfounded,  factually \n4  overstated, and disregards both the statutory and regulatory discretion Congress expressly conferred upon \n5  the federal government.  The relief they seek would not preserve the status quo, but instead disrupt the \n6  government’s longstanding management of legal services for unaccompanied alien children (“UAC”)—\n7  services that remain subject to available appropriations and the agency’s judgment. \n8  Plaintiffs are legal service providers seeking to compel the United States Department of Health \n9  and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), to indefinitely fund direct legal \n10  representation for UAC through specific contracting arrangements.  But the governing statute—the \n11  William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457 \n12  (codified  in  principal  part  at  8  U.S.C.  § 1232)—expressly  conditions  any  such  representation  on \n13  practicability and the availability of pro bono counsel.  It does not create an enforceable right to \n14  government-funded representation, let alone compel the agency to maintain any particular scope of \n15  services or contractual relationship.  Similarly, the regulatory language Plaintiffs cite, the Foundational \n16  Rule, codified at 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), confirms that ORR’s obligation to fund direct representation \n17  is contingent on both available appropriations and ORR’s discretionary determinations.  Congress never \n18  mandated indefinite funding for these services, and nothing in the TVPRA or ORR’s Foundational Rule \n19  suggests otherwise.   \n20  As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs seek to convert a discretionary, resource-dependent program into \n21  a judicially enforceable entitlement.  That effort fails as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs lack organizational \n22  standing, cannot show that the termination decision constitutes final agency action reviewable under the \n23  APA and can identify no statutory or regulatory provision that imposes a binding duty on the government \n24  to  maintain  uninterrupted  direct  representation  contracts.    At  most,  Plaintiffs  disagree  with  the \n25  government’s policy judgment to conserve resources and reallocate funding within the broad framework \n26  of the TVPRA—a judgment that courts have repeatedly held is committed to agency discretion. \n27  Regardless, this Court lacks jurisdiction over what is, at bottom, a dispute over the partial \n28  termination of a federal contract. Under the Tucker Act and the Contract Disputes Act, challenges to \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1 \n \n\n(260 of 348), Page 260 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 260 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 9 of 30\n \n \n \n1  government contract terminations must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  Plaintiffs’ attempt \n2  to recast a contract termination as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n3  § 701, et seq., cannot circumvent that exclusive remedial scheme.  Moreover, decisions regarding whether \n4  and how to terminate government contracts—particularly for the government’s convenience—are classic \n5  examples of actions committed to agency discretion and are not subject to judicial review under the APA. \n6  Nor can Plaintiffs establish any of the equitable factors required for injunctive relief.  Their claims \n7  of irreparable harm rest on speculative predictions about staffing decisions and funding shortfalls that are \n8  neither immediate nor irreversible.  Nothing in the record suggests that Plaintiffs are barred from \n9  continuing their work, pursuing other funding sources, or seeking relief through the dispute resolution \n10  provisions of the contract, setting aside the fact that none of the plaintiffs are actually a party to that \n11  agreement. A TRO’s extraordinary relief is not an appropriate mechanism for restructuring federal \n12  contract policy to align with a particular group of stakeholders’ policy preferences, particularly where the \n13  asserted harms are financial and the underlying legal theory is without merit. The Court should therefore \n14  deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \n15  II.  BACKGROUND \n16  A.  Legal Framework \n17  The statutory and regulatory framework governing legal representation for UAC in federal care \n18  and custody reflects a coordinated scheme established by Congress to balance the protection of vulnerable \n19  children with the Executive’s discretion over immigration and programmatic resource allocation.  This \n20  framework primarily originates in two statutes: the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (“HSA”) and the \n21  TVPRA. \n22 \n23  In 2002, Congress enacted the HSA, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (codified in relevant part \n24  at 6 U.S.C. § 279), abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) and transferring the \n25  responsibility for the care and placement of UAC from INS to ORR.  6 U.S.C. §§ 279(a), (b)(1)(A), (g)(2). \n26  The HSA defines a UAC as “a child who—(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United \n27  States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom— (i) there is no parent or legal \n28  guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 236\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2 \n \n\n(261 of 348), Page 261 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 261 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 10 of 30\n \n \n \n1  care and physical custody.” 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2). Further, it assigns ORR broad authority over the care \n2  and custody of UAC while they are in federal custody due to their immigration status, including \n3  coordinating their care and placement, ensuring their best interests in custodial decisions, and developing \n4  plans to “ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests \n5  of each such child.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A).  These responsibilities are carried out through cooperative \n6  agreements and contracts with care providers under ORR policies and oversight.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1); \n7  31 U.S.C. § 6305. \n8  2.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) \nCongress enacted the TVPRA in 2008 to strengthen protections for UAC and support their safe \n9 \nrepatriation or appropriate placement.  The statute, consistent with the HSA, makes the Secretary of HHS \n10 \nresponsible for the care and custody of UAC.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  The TVPRA explicitly directs HHS \n11 \nto prioritize the utilization of pro bono counsel and does not mandate direct government-funded legal \n12 \nrepresentation: Section 235 of the TVPRA encourages HHS to ensure UAC have counsel “to the greatest \n13 \nextent practicable” and “make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide \n14 \nrepresentation without charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n15 \nFurther, Section 235 encourages HHS to ensure that counsel is available to represent UAC in “legal \n16 \n17  proceedings  or  matters,”  expressly  linking  representation  duties  with  protecting  children  from \n18  “mistreatment,  exploitation,  and  trafficking.”  Additionally,  it  cross-references  Section  292  of  the \n19 \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  which  specifies  representation  “at  no  expense  to  the \n20 \nGovernment.”  8 U.S.C. § 1362.  Therefore, it is clear that HHS is not required to fund access to legal \n21 \ncounsel for UAC. The TVPRA’s language and structure demonstrate Congress’s intent to establish public-\n22 \nprivate partnerships and encourage pro bono counsel as the primary source of legal assistance for UC, and \n23 \nconferring on ORR exclusive discretion to determine when direct government-funded representation \n24 \n25  might be utilized (e.g., where pro bono resources are impractical or unavailable). \n26 \n3.  The Foundational Rule  \n27  In April 2024, ORR promulgated the Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, \n28  codified at 45 C.F.R. Part 410, to establish comprehensive regulations governing its UAC program.  The \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 237\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3 \n \n\n(262 of 348), Page 262 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 262 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 11 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Rule, which became effective July 1, 2024, formalized previously informal procedures and explicitly \n2  articulated ORR’s discretion regarding legal representation funding.  Specifically, the Rule provides that \n3  ORR “shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain \n4  unaccompanied children” only “to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available,” and only \n5  if securing pro bono counsel is impractical. 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). \n6  In contrast, other subsections impose mandatory obligations.  For instance, the Rule explicitly \n7  requires ORR to ensure UAC receive mandatory services such as a “presentation concerning the rights \n8  and responsibilities of undocumented children,” “information regarding the availability of free legal \n9  assistance,” and a “confidential legal consultation.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(2)(i)-(v).  This intentional \n10  distinction clarifies that direct funding for legal representation remains discretionary, conditional upon the \n11  availability of appropriations, and subject to agency determination. The Rule also reinforces congressional \n12  policy choices articulated in the TVPRA, highlighting the preferred reliance on pro bono counsel and \n13  emphasizing that direct representation services funded by ORR are not guaranteed and remain subject to \n14  the agency’s discretionary resource management. \n15  4.  Appropriations Acts and Congressional Intent \nCongress  periodically  appropriates  funds  to  support  ORR’s  UAC  program,  including  legal \n16 \nservices.  Appropriations language, however, consistently remains broad and nonspecific regarding \n17 \nprecise funding allocations.  Ex. A, Declaration of Toby Biswas (“Biswas Decl.”), ¶ 16. For example, the \n18 \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, provides general appropriations to \n19 \nexecute activities under Section 235 of the TVPRA without earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal \n20 \nrepresentation.  This general appropriation approach allows ORR flexibility in determining the allocation \n21 \nof resources based on agency priorities, the availability of pro bono counsel, and shifting immigration \n22 \npolicy needs. Biswas Decl., ¶ 16. \n23 \nSubsequent acts, including the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \n24 \nPub. L. No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding levels and provide broad discretion without altering \n25 \nstatutory obligations or imposing specific mandates for funding legal representation. Id. This ongoing \n26 \nlegislative practice underscores Congress’s intent to maintain flexibility for ORR, allowing the agency to \n27 \nprioritize  resources  efficiently  and  adaptively.  Id.  Such  discretionary  funding  practices  reflect  a \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 238\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4 \n \n\n(263 of 348), Page 263 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 263 of 348\n \n \n \n1  longstanding  Congressional  policy  to  balance  support  for  legal  services  with  practical  constraints, \n2  prioritizing public-private partnerships and pro bono resources where feasible, rather than imposing fixed \n3  or rigid funding mandates. Id. \n4  Indeed, at least one other court has considered this issue and determined that Congress did not \n5  specify what types of legal services ORR must fund with the appropriations intended for carrying out \n6  Section 235 of the TVPRA. Lucas R. v. Becerra, No. CV 18-5741, 2022 WL 2177454, at *31 (C.D. Cal. \n7  Mar. 11, 2022). Rather, ORR is “entitled to prioritize what type of legal representation ORR supports with \n8  appropriated funds, in furtherance of the TVPRA.” Id. The same analysis applies here: without a mandate \n9  from Congress in the most recent appropriations legislation, ORR has discretion to prioritize what types \n10  of services it funds to further the purpose of the TVPRA.  \n11  5.  The Current Contract and Termination Decision \nThe present dispute arises from ORR’s partial termination and descoping of a federal contract \n12 \nadministered by the Department of the Interior (“DOI”), which serves as the contracting agent through its \n13 \nInterior Business Center.  Id. ¶ 13. ORR directed DOI to partially terminate a contract previously funding \n14 \ndirect legal representation services.  Id. ¶¶ 12–13. This termination was executed through a formal decision \n15 \nmemorandum signed by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families \n16 \n(“ACF”). Id. ¶¶ 13–14. \n17 \nORR’s  decision  reflects  a  deliberate  exercise  of  statutory  discretion  to  prioritize  available \n18 \nappropriations and pro bono legal services.  While general direct representation contract funding was \n19 \nterminated, ORR maintains other legally required activities, including “know your rights” presentations \n20 \nand confidential legal screening consultations.  Id. ¶ 5, 11. \n21 \nThis contract termination aligns with ORR’s statutory and regulatory discretion under the TVPRA, \n22 \nthe Foundational Rule, and relevant appropriations acts, none of which mandate continuous, direct legal \n23 \nrepresentation  funding  when  viable  alternatives,  such  as  pro  bono  representation,  exist.    Id.  ¶ 14.  \n24 \nAdditionally, the termination decision reflects ORR’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, ensuring that \n25 \nlimited resources are allocated effectively, prudently managing public funds, and preserving governmental \n26 \nflexibility to respond to evolving priorities and urgent programmatic needs.  Id. ¶ 11, 16.   \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 239\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5 \n \n\n(264 of 348), Page 264 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 264 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 13 of 30\n \n \n \n1  III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW \n2  Preliminary injunctive relief “is an extraordinary and drastic remedy,” Lopez v. Brewer, 680 F.3d \n3  1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), that is “never awarded as of \n4  right,” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation \n5  omitted); see also Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) \n6  (noting that the standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is “substantially identical” to the \n7  standard for issuing a preliminary injunction).  Thus, this relief “should not be granted unless the movant, \n8  by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Lopez, 680 F.3d at 1072 (internal quotation marks \n9  and citation omitted; emphasis in original).  This is a “difficult task.”  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 \n10  F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010).  To prove their entitlement to such relief, Plaintiffs must establish that:  (1) \n11  they are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n12  preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) an injunction is in the public \n13  interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Under the Ninth Circuit’s sliding \n14  scale test for preliminary injunctive relief, “serious questions going to the merits” and “a hardship balance \n15  that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other two \n16  elements of the Winter test are also met.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th \n17  Cir. 2011). \n18  IV.  ARGUMENT \n19  A.  Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits. \n1.  Plaintiffs lack standing because they are not within the zone of interests that            \n20 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232 is intended to protect. \n21  Plaintiffs lack standing because the statutory provision that, according to Plaintiffs, ensures that \n22  UAC have access to legal counsel, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), was not intended to protect Plaintiffs. When an \n23  organization challenges an agency action under the APA, the organization must show that it is within the \n24  “zone of interests” that the statute was meant to protect. Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 \n25  (1990); I.N.S. v. Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles Cnty. Fed’n of Lab., 510 U.S. 1301, 1305 \n26  (1993). To fall within the “zone of interests” of a statutory provision, “the plaintiff must establish that the \n27  injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse effect upon him) falls within the ‘zone of \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 240\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6 \n \n\n(265 of 348), Page 265 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 265 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 14 of 30\n \n \n \n1  interests’ sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \n2  complaint.” Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990); Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \n3  Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012). When a plaintiff brings an APA claim \n4  against a federal agency, courts look to “the statute that [the plaintiff] says was violated,” rather than the \n5  APA itself to determine whether the party’s injury is within the zone of interests. Match-E-Be-Nash-She-\n6  Wish, 567 U.S. at 224 (quotation marks omitted). While an “explicit mention” of Congress’s intent is not \n7  required, something in the “particular provision of law upon which the plaintiff relies” must indicate that \n8  Congress intended to protect the organization. Pit River Tribe v. BLM, 793 F.3d 1147, 1157 (9th Cir. \n9  2015) (citation omitted). That an agency rule or policy may affect the way an organization allocates its \n10  resources does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests the statute meant to \n11  protect. Legalization Assistance Project, 510 U.S. at 1305.  \n12  Nothing in the text of 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), nor in the legislative history, indicates that Congress \n13  enacted the legal-services provision to address the financial interests of organizations such as Plaintiffs in \n14  this case. Rather, the plain text focuses on the interests of the UAC: it requires HHS, to the greatest extent \n15  practicable and “consistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1362,” to ensure that certain UAC “have counsel to represent \n16  them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” \n17  Id. § 1232(c)(5). This provision protects UAC from mistreatment, not to line Plaintiffs’ pocketbooks with \n18  taxpayer funding. Indeed, when reviewing the statute as a whole, the only intended beneficiary of \n19  subsection (c), entitled “Providing safe and secure placements for children,” are UAC.1  \n20  Moreover, Congress’s caveat that such legal services must be “consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1362” \n21  demonstrates that Congress did not intend for the government to front the bill for legal services or to pay \n22  organizations, such as Plaintiffs. 8 U.S.C. § 1362 provides that aliens have the right to representation in \n23  immigration proceedings, as long as the representation is “at no expense to the Government.” Congress’s \n24   \n1 Each sub-subsection provides safeguards for ensuring the safety of UAC who are in HHS’s custody. See \n25  id. § 1232(c)(1) (requiring agencies to implement policies to protect UAC from trafficking, victimization, \nand exploitation); id. § 1232(c)(2) (requiring UAC to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in \n26 \ntheir best interest); id. § 1232(c)(3) (requiring that UAC be placed with custodians who will provide for \ntheir well-being); id. § 1232(c)(4) (ensuring that custodians receive legal orientation explaining the \n27 \ncustodian’s responsibility to ensure that the UAC appear at immigration proceedings and are protected \n28  from harm); id. § 1232(c)(5) (see supra); id. § 1232(c)(6) (authorizing HHS to appoint child advocates for \nUAC who are particularly vulnerable).  \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 241\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  7 \n \n\n(266 of 348), Page 266 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 266 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 15 of 30\n \n \n \n1  reference to this statutory provision allows no room for doubt: Congress directed HHS to refrain from \n2  using taxpayer funding to pay for UAC legal services in immigration proceedings. Further, the second \n3  part  of  § 1232(c)(5)  confirms  that  Congress  did  not  intend  to  financially  benefit  legal-services \n4  organizations. Congress required that HHS “shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono \n5  counsel” who will represent UAC “without charge.” Id. § 1232(c)(5). Congress intended that HHS would \n6  not spend money on legal services for UAC and, instead, would seek counsel who would represent UAC \n7  without using taxpayer funding. Id.  \n8  Further, Congress’s provision for funding child advocates in subsection (c) implies that Congress’s \n9  silence—or, indeed, prohibition—regarding funding for legal services confirms that Congress never \n10  intended for legal-service providers to receive taxpayer funding. “[I]t is generally presumed that Congress \n11  acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits \n12  it in another.” BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n13  Congress explicitly provides federal funding for child advocates, and thereby intends to benefit child \n14  advocates, in subsection (c)(6). By comparison, in subsection (c)(5), Congress discourages federal funding \n15  for legal-service providers, mandating that HHS secure “pro bono” counsel and prohibiting federal \n16  funding for counsel in immigration proceedings. The juxtaposition of these two subsections leaves no \n17  doubt as to Congress’s intent: federal funding should not be used to fund legal-service organizations like \n18  Plaintiffs. \n19  That Plaintiffs have lost funding and need to reallocate resources does not place them within the \n20  zone of interests that Congress meant to protect. Accordingly, Plaintiffs likely cannot show that they have \n21  standing to challenge HHS’s funding decisions under the APA.  \n22 \n23 \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim because they seek monetary \n24 \nrelief, and the APA does not waive sovereign immunity over such claims. Although styled as a request \n25 \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief, the relief that they seek is simple: they want to compel the United \n26 \nStates to continue making payments—relief precluded under the APA. \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 242\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  8 \n \n\n(267 of 348), Page 267 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 267 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 16 of 30\n \n \n \n1  “It is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence \n2  of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.” United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983). \n3  Accordingly, before a court may exercise jurisdiction over any suit against the United States, the plaintiff \n4  must unequivocally show that the United States has waived sovereign immunity, and that their claims fall \n5  squarely within the terms of that waiver. United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, \n6  472 (2003) (citations omitted); see also Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (stating that the waiver \n7  of sovereign immunity cannot be implied, but “must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.”).  \n8  Relevant here, the APA only waives sovereign immunity over actions seeking relief “other than \n9  monetary damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. The APA “does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims \n10  seeking equitable relief.” N. Star Alaska v. United States, 14 F.3d 36, 38 (9th Cir. 1994) (cleaned up). As \n11  a result, a court must carefully discern whether a request dressed up as a claim for injunctive or declaratory \n12  relief is actually seeking monetary relief, as “any claim for legal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, \n13  be phrased in terms of an injunction.” Great-W. Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 211 \n14  n.1 (2002).  \n15  The APA does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity here because the relief Plaintiffs seek \n16  is payment. Specifically, Plaintiffs ask this Court to: (1) declare that “Defendants are required to continue \n17  funding legal representation to unaccompanied alien children, consistent with the TVPRA and ORR’s \n18  Foundational  Rule;  (2)  enjoin  Defendants  nationwide  from  ceasing  to  fund  counsel  to  represent \n19  unaccompanied alien children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule; (3) to declare that \n20  Defendants’ actions violate the APA; and (4) to set aside Defendants’ actions. ECF No. 1 at 39 (emphases \n21  added).2  Regardless of how Plaintiffs label their request for relief, the result of granting any of their \n22  requests is the same: HHS must continue paying Acacia, and consequently, continue paying Plaintiffs. \n23  The APA does not waive sovereign immunity for such a claim, and thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to \n24  order Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with the monetary relief they seek. N. Star Alaska, 14 F.3d at 38. \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \n2 Page number references, when to filings on the Court’s docket in this case, are to the page number in \n28  the header supplied by the Court’s ECF system.  \n \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  9 \n \n\n(268 of 348), Page 268 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 268 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 17 of 30\n \n \n \n1  The APA also does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity here because HHS’s funding \n2  decision under the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule are discretionary. The APA does not permit judicial \n3  review of “agency action” that “is committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The \n4  TVPRA provides HHS broad discretion in determining how to provide legal services to UAC. While \n5  Section 235 mandates that HHS ensure that counsel is available to represent UAC “to the greatest extent \n6  practicable” in “legal proceedings or matters,” it also cross-references the provision of the INA—8 U.S.C. \n7  § 1362—which specifies that “the privilege” of being represented in removal proceedings is “at no \n8  expense to the Government.” The TVPRA also directs HHS to “make every effort to utilize the services \n9  of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation without charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). Likewise, \n10  the Foundational Rule explicitly articulates ORR’s discretion regarding legal representation funding.  It \n11  provides that ORR “shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation \n12  for  certain  unaccompanied  children”  only  “to  the  extent  ORR  determines  that  appropriations  are \n13  available,” and only if securing pro bono counsel is impractical. 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). The decision \n14  to fund direct legal services is “subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations.” Id. \n15  Moreover, Congress’s funding of ORR’s UAC program, including legal services, demonstrates \n16  that HHS has been allowed discretion in how it allocates resources.  For example, the Further Consolidated \n17  Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, provides general appropriations to execute activities under \n18  Section 235 of the TVPRA without earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal representation. And \n19  subsequent acts, including the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. \n20  No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding levels and provide broad discretion without altering statutory \n21  obligations or imposing specific mandates for funding legal representation. Id. ¶ 16.  This ongoing \n22  legislative practice underscores Congress’s intent to maintain flexibility for ORR, allowing the agency to \n23  prioritize resources efficiently and adaptively.  Id.; see also 6 U.S.C. 279(b)(1) (making the Director of \n24  ORR  responsible  for  activities  including  coordinating  and  implementing  the  care  of  UAC  and \n25  implementing  policies  with  respect  to  the  care  and  placement  of  unaccompanied  alien  children);                      \n26  8 U.S.C. § 1232(i) (authorizing the Secretary of HHS to “award grants to, and enter into contracts with, \n27  voluntary agencies to carry out this section and section 279 of title 6.”). \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 244\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  10 \n \n\n(269 of 348), Page 269 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 269 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 18 of 30\n \n \n \n1  The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction because decisions about the substance of HHS’s decision to \n2  reallocate resources from direct representation into other aspects of the UAC program is firmly committed \n3  to the agency’s discretion.  In Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), the Supreme Court held that the \n4  Indian Health Service’s decision to discontinue a program it had previously funded and to instead \n5  reallocate those funds to other programs was committed to agency discretion by law and thus not \n6  reviewable under the APA’s reasoned-decision making standards.  See id. at 185–88.  The Court explained \n7  that the “allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is” an “administrative decision traditionally \n8  regarded as committed to agency discretion,” because the “very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to \n9  give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in \n10  what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at 192. \n11  Indeed, an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation requires “a complicated \n12  balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise”: whether its “resources are best \n13  spent” on one program or another; whether it “is likely to succeed” in fulfilling its statutory mandate; \n14  whether a particular program “best fits the agency’s overall policies”; and, “indeed, whether the agency \n15  has enough resources to fund a program at all.”  Id. at 193 (internal citations omitted).  “Congress may \n16  always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative \n17  statutes.”  Id.  But as long as the agency abides by the relevant statutes (and whatever self-imposed \n18  obligations may arise from regulations or grant instruments), the APA “gives the courts no leave to \n19  intrude.”  Id.  Because the TVPRA confers HHS discretion to determine how best to allocate and \n20  administer the funding for the UAC program, HHS’s decisions are not subject to review under the APA. \n21  3.  This Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because the rights they \nseek to enforce must be brought in the Federal Court of Claims. \n22 \n Although Plaintiffs cite to the APA as the basis for their claims, the rights that they seek to enforce, \n23 \nand the relief that they seek, are only available to them through contract, and thus their claims are \n24 \nprecluded by the Tucker Act.3\n25 \n26 \n \n27  3 The Tucker Act provides: “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment \nupon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any \n28  regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a)(1) (emphasis added). \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 245\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  11 \n \n\n(270 of 348), Page 270 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 270 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 19 of 30\n \n \n \n1  claim is based upon a contract with the United States and subject to the jurisdictional restrictions in the \n2  Tucker Act. North Side Lumber v. Block, 753 F.2d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 931 \n3  (1985) (citing Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). The Tucker Act \n4  “impliedly forbids” APA claims involving government contracts. Id. at 1485 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1656, \n5  94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13). To determine whether the Tucker Act precludes a contract claim “disguised” as \n6  an APA claim, the Ninth Circuit employs the D.C. Circuit’s Megapulse test. United Aeronautical Corp. \n7  v. United States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1025–26 (9th Cir. 2023) (citing Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–\n8  68). Under Megapulse, a court must decide whether “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff \n9  bases its claims” arises under a contract and whether “the type of relief sought” is normally available as a \n10  contract remedy. Id. “If rights and remedies are statutorily or constitutionally based, then districts courts \n11  have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies are contractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims \n12  does, even if the plaintiff formally seeks injunctive relief.” Id. (emphases in original).  \n13  Two weeks ago, a district court in the District of Columbia decided a case very similar to this one \n14  and determined that the plaintiff organization’s claims resounded in contact and, thus, had to be brought \n15  in the Court of Federal Claims. United States Conf. of Cath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:25-CV-\n16  00465, 2025 WL 763738, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025). Like here, the relief sought in Conf. of Cath. \n17  Bishops was styled as a request for an injunction, yet the court correctly reasoned that, in actuality, the \n18  relief sought was for “the Government to keep paying up.” Id. at *5. The district court therefore held that \n19  the claim was “founded upon a contract” and “must be heard in Claims Court.” Id. at *7 (citing Sharp v. \n20  Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.) (“We know of no case in which a court has \n21  asserted jurisdiction . . . to issue an injunction compelling the United States to fulfill its contractual \n22  obligations.”)). So too here. \n23  As explained, Section IV.A.2, supra, the relief Plaintiffs seek is for “the Government to keep \n24  paying up,” Conf. of Cath. Bishops, 2025 WL 763738, at *2. Because they seek monetary relief, which is \n25  unavailable under the APA but normally available in a contract dispute, their claim is precluded by the \n26  Tucker Act. Id. at *7; United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1025–26. \n27  Not only does Plaintiffs’ requested relief resound in contract, but the “source of rights” upon which \n28  they base their claims arises from a contract. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–68. Plaintiffs cannot separate \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  12 \n \n\n(271 of 348), Page 271 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 271 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 20 of 30\n \n \n \n1  their causes of action from their contractual relationship with Acacia. Plaintiffs lack standing to assert \n2  claims against the United States absent the contract that HHS has with Acacia because without it they \n3  would have no injury. In other words, had Acacia never entered into a contract with HHS to provide direct \n4  legal services to UAC, Plaintiffs would have never received funding to provide such legal services and \n5  would have no injury to complain of. No statute or regulation requires HHS to compensate Plaintiffs for \n6  their legal services. Absent a statutory or constitutional entitlement to the appropriated funds that they \n7  seek, their injury arises from termination of a contract. Because Plaintiffs’ “source of rights” for funding \n8  from appropriations stems solely from their contract with Acacia, this Court lacks jurisdiction over their \n9  claims. Id. at 967–68; United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1025–26. \n10  4.  Plaintiffs cannot show that a favorable decision in this case would likely \nredress their alleged injuries. \n11 \nTo the extent Plaintiffs argue that they are not challenging the government’s decision to end the \n12 \ncontract with Acacia but, rather, the decision to discontinue providing appropriated funds to any legal-\n13 \nservices organization, they likewise lack standing to assert such a claim. The “irreducible constitutional \n14 \nminimum” of Article III standing consists of (1) “injury in fact,” (2) “a causal connection between the \n15 \ninjury and the conduct complained of,” and (3) a likelihood “that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \n16 \ndecision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (quotation marks omitted). The \n17 \nthird element of Article III standing, redressability, requires that it “be likely, as opposed to merely \n18 \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citation and \n19 \ninternal quotation marks omitted). To show a likelihood of redressability, Plaintiffs must “show that there \n20 \nwould be a ‘change in a legal status’ as a consequence of a favorable decision” and that this change would \n21 \nsignificantly increase the likelihood that they would obtain the relief sought. Novak v. United States, 795 \n22 \nF.3d 1012, 1019–20 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Renee v. Duncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012)).  \n23 \nThe relief that Plaintiffs seek—if untethered to their contract claim—would not likely provide \n24 \nthem with the monetary relief they seek. Enforcing the statutory authority Plaintiffs rely on in arguing that \n25 \nCongress intended to fund direct-legal services, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), would have the opposite effect of \n26 \nthe relief Plaintiffs seek. As explained above, Congress did not intend to financially benefit Plaintiffs in \n27 \n28  ensuring that UAC would have access to legal services; instead, Congress envisioned that such legal \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 247\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  13 \n \n\n(272 of 348), Page 272 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 272 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 21 of 30\n \n \n \n1  services would generally be provided pro bono at no expense to the government. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n2 \nIf the Court were to enforce the plain language and purpose of Section 235 of the TVPRA, it would order \n3 \nthe government to seek out pro bono counsel for direct legal services and, to the extent possible, avoid \n4 \nfunding legal services at the government’s expense. Of course, this result would not redress Plaintiffs’ \n5 \ninjuries, as they seek to be paid for their services and not acting in a pro bono capacity. \n6 \nLikewise, because the Foundational Rule provides HHS with discretion as to whether and how to \n7 \ndisburse appropriations for direct legal services, Plaintiffs cannot show that ordering HHS to comply with \n8 \nits regulation would redress their injury. Under the plain language of the regulation, HHS would maintain \n9 \nthe discretion to determine whether to fund direct-legal services for UAC, and, using that discretion, it \n10 \nwould likely continue to decline to continue funding. Biswas Decl., ¶ 17. And even if HHS changed course \n11 \nand decided to exercise favorable discretion by funding direct legal services, it could contract with \n12 \norganizations other than Acacia and Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 19. There is nothing that Plaintiffs can cite to that \n13 \nwould require or encourage HHS to continue funding the Plaintiffs in this case. Id. ¶¶ 17-19. In other \n14 \nwords, even if the agency continued funding direct legal services, Plaintiffs cannot show that it is likely \n15 \nthat HHS will continue to contract with Acacia or with any of the Plaintiffs in this case. Id. Thus, Plaintiffs’ \n16 \nredressability—that HHS would continue funding Acacia or any of the Plaintiffs—is speculative at best \n17 \nand insufficient to establish standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to show that they \n18 \nlikely have Article III standing because enforcing the relevant policies and statutes would not redress their \n19 \nalleged injury. \n20 \n5.  The Termination Contract Termination at Issue Does Not Violate the APA   \n21 \nPlaintiffs erroneously argue that termination of direct legal services violate the APA. Although, \n22 \nthe money was authorized by Congress, Congress never mandated its spending. When Congress does not \n23 \nrequire the agency to spend a certain amount of the appropriated fund, the agency has discretion over how \n24 \nmuch to spend up to the cap provided by Congress. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n \n25 \nof Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 432 (2024) (“The appropriation of “sums not exceeding” a specified amount \n26 \ndid not by itself mandate that the Executive spend that amount; as was the case in England, such \n27 \nappropriations instead provided the Executive discretion over how much to spend up to a cap.”).

Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182 (2012) (“An agency’s discretion to spend \n4  appropriated funds is cabined only by the ‘text of the appropriation,’ not by Congress’ expectations of \n5  how the funds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative history.”) (quoting Int’l Union, UAW v. \n6  Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 860-61 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Scalia, J.))  \n7  6.  The  Foundational  Rule  Does  Not  Require  Funding  for  Taxpayer-funded \nDirect  Immigration  Legal  Representation  Consistent  with  Available \n8 \nAppropriations.   \n9  Plaintiffs  contend  that  Defendants  have  “ended”  funding  for  legal  representation  of \n10  unaccompanied alien children despite the availability of appropriated funds for this purpose through at \n11  least September 30, 2027, and that, by the supposed ending, Defendants violate what they believe is a \n12  mandate in the Foundational Rule to provide counsel for UAC to the extent there are appropriated funds \n13  available to do so.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 139.  As Plaintiffs note, to establish a claim under United States ex rel. \n14  Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266–67 (1954), such a claim must show: (1) that the government \n15  has violated its own regulations; and (2) that Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced by that violation. \n16  ECF No. 7 at 14 (citing  Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. \n17  30, 2024)). To start, Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants have violated their own regulations. \n18  Indeed, Plaintiffs overlook the fact that the funding at issue here is required only “insofar that it is not \n19  practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  As HHS noted in the \n20  preamble to its Foundational Rule, ORR, consistent with the TVPRA, makes every effort to use pro \n21  bono legal services “to the greatest extent practicable” to secure counsel for UAC in these contexts.  \n22  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34,529 (Apr. 30, 2024).  \n23  HHS notes that ORR-funded legal services providers may help coordinate referral to pro bono legal \n24  services and that ORR provides each UAC with a list of pro bono service providers.4  Id.  Historically, \n25  HHS has acknowledged that, in some cases, it is impracticable for ORR to secure pro bono legal \n26  services, such as in markets where demand exceeds supply, or during times of influx.  Id.  But where \n27 \n \n28  4 The list of pro bono service providers is statutorily required under the TVPRA. 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(I).   \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 249\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  15 \n \n\n(274 of 348), Page 274 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 274 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 23 of 30\n \n \n \n1  and when it is “impracticable” for ORR to secure pro bono legal services is a determination to be made \n2  by ORR. Id. (noting that the decision is subject to ORR’s “discretion.”). Further, since ORR must be \n3  selective in the kinds of legal services it funds, it therefore proposed to establish its discretion to fund \n4  legal services for specific purposes “based on its judgment and priorities.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 34,529.  The \n5  clause “based on its judgment and priorities” reflects that ORR has considerable discretion to determine \n6  how the provision of legal services to UAC is funded.  The determination of when such provision is \n7  “impracticable” is a decision to be made exclusively by ORR, applying its expertise, and not by \n8  Plaintiffs or the Court.  \n9  Plaintiffs next overlook the fact that ORR shall fund legal service providers subject to ORR’s \n10  discretion,5\n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15  Plaintiffs note that HHS has an obligation “to the greatest extent practicable” and consistent with \n16  8 U.S.C. § 1362, to ensure that UAC have counsel in their immigration proceedings.  HHS interpreted \n17  “to the greatest extent practicable” to open the door to a grant of authority to pay for legal services \n18  beyond that available from pro bono legal service providers.  89 Fed. Reg. at 24,529.  “To the greatest \n19  extent practicable,” however, cannot reasonably be read as a mandate for HHS to pay for direct \n20  immigration legal representation for all UAC, unconditionally.  In the preamble to the Foundational \n21  Rule, HHS stated that it “understands that some commenters would like ORR “to fully fund legal \n22  services to all [UAC].”  Id.  HHS also observed that it received comments questioning ORR’s legal \n23  authority to pay for legal services for UAC and suggesting that ORR not use taxpayer funding for legal \n24  representation for UAC.  Id.  HHS concluded that its approach to providing legal services to UAC, by \n25  enabling them to access ORR has determined that “its approach to  providing legal services to \n26  unaccompanied  children  by  enabling  them  to  access  pro  bono  counsel  ‘to  the  greatest  extent \n27 \n \n28  5 Defendants do not contest that the conditions “to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are \navailable” and “subject to . . .available appropriations,” in 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), are met here.  \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 250\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  16 \n \n\n(275 of 348), Page 275 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 275 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 24 of 30\n \n \n \n1  practicable’ and funding legal services for additional unaccompanied children, as resources allow, is \n2  consistent with ORR’s statutory obligations.”  Id.  HHS’s interpretation of the INA and TVPRA – as \n3  Congress’s grant of discretion to ORR to provide funding for immigration services to UAC – is far \n4  from a mandate to do provide such funding.   \n5  Similarly, and as Plaintiffs point out, HHS did acknowledge that most UAC need legal services \n6  to resolve their immigration status, and such representation appears to have a significant impact on \n7  court appearance.  ECF No. 7 at 13 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 34,529).  Further, as Plaintiffs note, HHS \n8  affirmed that “legal services providers who represent unaccompanied children undertake an important \n9  function” and explains ORR’s goal of “100 percent legal representation of unaccompanied children.”  \n10  Id. (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 34,526).  But Plaintiffs fail to explain why they believe that such services \n11  must be funded by the taxpayer.  HHS’s shift to increased emphasis and reliance upon pro bono service \n12  providers might not be Plaintiffs’ preference, but it is consistent with the plain language of section \n13  1309(a)(4) and HHS’s explanations for why it sculpted the language in 1309(a)(4) as it did.  In their \n14  motion for a TRO, however, Plaintiffs are silent regarding the importance of pro bono counsel in \n15  providing advice and legal representation for UAC, an importance reflected in both section 1309(a)(4) \n16  and the preamble.  ECF No. 7.   \n17  B.  Plaintiffs Will Not Face Irreparable Harm Without a TRO  \n18  The “most important” Winter factor is whether Plaintiffs demonstrate irreparable harm.  Caribbean \n19  Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988); see also Koller v. Brown, 224 F. Supp. \n20  3d 871, 879 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (noting it is the “single most important prerequisite” for a TRO).  The \n21  “possibility” of harm is insufficient to secure a TRO; Plaintiffs must show that “irreparable injury is likely \n22  in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original).  “Speculative injury” does \n23  not suffice; Plaintiffs must show both immediacy and likelihood that they will be harmed absent a TRO.  \n24  See Caribbean Marine Servs. Co., 844 F.2d at 674.  Where “[m]ultiple contingencies must occur” before \n25  Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries, the injuries are “too speculative” to justify a TRO.  Id. at 675.   \n26  Plaintiffs have failed to make the requisite threshold “clear showing of irreparable harm.”  See \n27  Garcia, 786 F.3d at 746 (reiterating that “[h]arm must be proved, not presumed”).  Plaintiffs have failed \n28  to  demonstrate  irreparable  harm  sufficient  to  warrant  extraordinary injunctive  relief.

Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014); \n4  Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1202 (9th Cir. 1980) \n5  (“Monetary injury is not normally considered irreparable.”). Economic damages are not traditionally \n6  considered irreparable because the injury can later be remedied by a damage award. See Sampson v. \n7  Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974) (“[I]t seems clear that the temporary loss of income, ultimately to be \n8  recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury . . . .” (internal quotation omitted)); Caribbean \n9  Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d 668, 676 (9th Cir. 1988) (“Subjective apprehensions and \n10  unsupported predictions of revenue loss are not sufficient to satisfy a plaintiff’s burden of demonstrating \n11  an immediate threat of irreparable harm.”); Arcamuzi v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 938 \n12  (9th Cir. 1987) (“[Temporary economic loss alone generally is not a basis for injunctive relief.”); \n13  Goldie’s Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, 739 F.2d 466, 471 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Mere financial injury . . . \n14  will not constitute irreparable harm if adequate compensatory relief will be available in the course of \n15  litigation.”).                        \n16    While Plaintiffs characterize their harm as “frustrating their mission,” the actual harm that \n17  Plaintiffs allege is “lack of funding,” which is plainly monetary harm. See ECF No. 7 at 16 (“There is no \n18  question that ceasing funding for legal representation services for UAC and terminating the existing \n19  services will cause imminent harm that cannot be later remediated.”) (emphasis added); id. at 17 \n20  (“Plaintiffs have relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding for these critical resources \n21  will continue to be available.”) (emphasis added); id. (“Sustaining these services without this funding \n22  will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.”) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs \n23  cannot avoid the well-established case law holding that monetary loss (even if significant), is not \n24  irreparable harm.  \n25  Plaintiffs next allege  that “ceasing funding for legal representation services for UAC and \n26  terminating existing contracts will cause imminent harm” because it will cause them to cease providing \n27  certain legal services. ECF No. 7 at 16. But that too is without merit as the Cancellation Order does not \n28  prevent Plaintiffs from continuing to provide legal services – it merely prevents them from receipt of \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 252\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  18 \n \n\n(277 of 348), Page 277 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 277 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 26 of 30\n \n \n \n1  federally funded payment for those services. Indeed, Plaintiffs may freely  provide these services pro \n2  bono, which is in line with the plain language and purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and would be \n3  welcomed by Defendants. \n4  Plaintiffs’ further assertion that “impacted attorneys and staff have years of individualized \n5  experience and wisdom with clients making rehiring layoffs impracticable” is speculative and attenuated. \n6  ECF No. 7 at 18. “Certain impending” injury cannot be shown when the asserted injury is based on a \n7  “speculative chain of possibilities,” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013), or on \n8  “speculation about the decisions of independent actors,” id. at 414. As the D.C. Circuit has cautioned: \n9  “Because of the generally contingent nature of predictions of future third-party action,” a court should \n10  be “sparing in crediting claims of anticipated injury by market actors and other parties alike.” Arpaio v. \n11  Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The Court should likewise decline to entertain Plaintiffs’ \n12  speculative assertion about what third parties—individuals who might be laid off—would do if called \n13  back to work. \n14  C.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Weigh Against Entry of a Temporary \nRestraining Order.  \n15 \nWhere the government is a party, the balance of equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes \n16 \nBay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n17 \n(2009)).  Courts “explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the \n18 \npublic at large.”  Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) \n19 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In weighing these factors, Plaintiffs rely on their previous \n20 \narguments pointing to their allegation that harm arises from Defendants’ “shirking [of] their voluntarily \n21 \nundertaken obligations.” Motion at 19. But as described above, neither the purported merit of their claims \n22 \nnor their alleged injury support entry of a TRO.  This is particularly true because Plaintiffs make no \n23 \nattempt to explain how the broad relief requested in their proposed order (Dkt. 7-3) is tethered to the harms \n24 \nthey claim.  On the other hand, Defendants are legally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement \n25 \nof their federal grants.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1232; 45 C.F.R. § 410.   \n26 \nHere, the balance of the equities and public interest tip decisively in Defendants’ favor.  If the \n27 \nstatus quo is preserved during the pendency of the case, Plaintiffs can still obtain any funding they may \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 253\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  19 \n \n\n(278 of 348), Page 278 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 278 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 27 of 30\n \n \n \n1  be entitled to as a result of the case’s ultimate resolution.  But the opposite is not true—if Plaintiffs are \n2  given access now, and draw down the funds throughout the litigation, Defendants will be left with no \n3  meaningful recourse even if they prevail.  Defendants will bear all the risk if the Court enters a preliminary \n4  injunction, whereas Plaintiffs will bear none if it denies one. Such a proposition turns Plaintiffs’ burden \n5  of establishing irreparable harm on its head. In short, the equities clearly favor Defendants. \n6  Plaintiffs’ motion fails to acknowledge the governmental harm that will be imposed through \n7  injunctive relief here, suggesting that the TRO is merely to spend appropriated funds. This ignores the \n8  substantial harm an injunction imposes by usurping executive branch authority to manage complex \n9  programs and allocate billions in taxpayer funds. Forcing continuation of one specific contract hinders \n10  ORR’s ability to adapt to potentially changing migration flows, shelter needs, health concerns, or to \n11  implement potentially more cost-effective or impactful service models across the entire UAC program \n12  spectrum.  \n13  What’s more, the public interests at stake here include effective governance. While Plaintiffs \n14  legitimately describe the public interest in protecting vulnerable children and upholding the TVPRA, the \n15  public  interest  also  encompasses  the  efficient,  flexible,  and  responsible  administration  of  federal \n16  programs, interests which are opposed to forcing the government to continue to fund paid attorneys. It \n17  includes ensuring ORR can make difficult choices to best serve the overall needs of all unaccompanied \n18  alien  children  within  its  care,  using  its  expertise  and  the  discretion  Congress  provided.  Judicial \n19  micromanagement of appropriations allocation via Plaintiffs’ requested TRO arguably undermines, rather \n20  than serves, the broader public interest in competent government. \n21  Indeed, an injunction here would effectively disable the administration from effectuating its \n22 \nexecutive authority consistent with their constitutional and statutory authorities. See Maryland v. King, \n23 \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (cleaned up) (“[a]ny time a [government] is \n24 \nenjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of \n25 \nirreparable injury.”). Where the Government is legally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement \n26 \nor allocation of federal funds, but is nonetheless ordered to release the funds, such funds may not be \n27 \n28  retrievable afterwards. While Plaintiffs emphasize the mandate in 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) that HHS “shall \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 254\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  20 \n \n\n(279 of 348), Page 279 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 279 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 28 of 30\n \n \n \n1  ensure . . . that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel,” this mandate is explicitly qualified by \n2 \n“to the greatest extent practicable”. This is not mere suggestion; it is the legal standard set by Congress, \n3 \ninherently requiring agency judgment. Here, “practicable” arguably necessitates balancing the goal of \n4 \nproviding counsel against competing demands, resource limitations across the entire UAC program, \n5 \nadministrative feasibility, and the effectiveness of different service delivery models. It does not mandate \n6 \nfunding one specific contract indefinitely, irrespective of other considerations.  \n7 \n8  In sum, the decision to terminate funding under the contract represents a permissible exercise of \n9  the discretion afforded to ORR by Congress under 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and codified in its own \n10  regulations, see 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). It is not contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious. An \n11  injunction would improperly substitute judicial preference for agency judgment, unduly restricting the \n12  executive’s ability to allocate resources and adapt to evolving needs. As a result, the balance of equities \n13  and the public interest, properly considered, weigh against granting the extraordinary relief of a TRO. \n14  D.  If the Court issues a TRO, it should require Plaintiffs to Post Security. \n15  Finally, if the Court deems a TRO warranted (which it should not), Plaintiffs should be required \n16  to post bond.  Rule 65(c) provides that a court “may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary \n17  restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the \n18  costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. \n19  Civ. P. 65(c).  The circumstances here warrant requiring Plaintiffs to provide security in an amount that \n20  could compensate Defendants for the losses caused by a preliminary injunction (in the event that \n21  Defendants are found to have been wrongfully enjoined).  To the extent that the Court grants relief to \n22  Plaintiff, Defendants respectfully request that the Court require Plaintiffs to post security for any taxpayer \n23  funds distributed during the pendency of the Court’s Order. Since this case is ultimately about financial \n24  allocation, it thus follows that Rule 65(c)’s explicit requirements necessitate Plaintiffs’ posting of security.  \n25  V.  CONCLUSION \n26  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. \n \n27   \n   \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nStay Motion Addendum 255\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  21 \n \n\n(280 of 348), Page 280 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 280 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 29 of 30\n \n \n \n1  DATED: March 31, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

I am the Director of the Division of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Policy for the \n13 \nUAC Bureau of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), within the Administration for Children and \n14 \nFamilies (ACF), a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \n15 \n2.  I have held various roles within ORR since I first started working at the agency in \n16 \nNovember 2009, and I have held my current role since April 2023. My job duties include, among other \n17  things, responsibility for all aspects of the development and implementation of ORR’s policies and \nprocedures concerning the care and custody UAC, including those related to the provision of legal \n18 \nservices to UAC.  In this capacity, I am responsible for ensuring ORR’s implementation of and \n19 \ncompliance with programmatic policy prerogatives and statutory responsibilities, such as those arising \n20 \nunder the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and \n21 \nORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 CFR part 410, which include provisions related to the provision of UAC \n22  legal services.1 \n23  3.  This declaration is based upon my personal knowledge, information acquired by me in the \n24  course of performing my official duties, information contained in the records of ACF and ORR, and \ninformation conveyed to me by current agency employees and contractors.  Further, I have reviewed the \n25 \npleadings in this matter, and am generally familiar with the facts and circumstances underlying plaintiffs’ \n26 \n27 \n \n1 ORR policies with respect to UAC are also embodied in the ORR UAC Bureau Policy Guide \n28 \n(“UAC Policy Guide”), which is publicly available on ORR’s website, and has recently been made \navailable to the public in a Freedom of Information Act reading room:  https://acf.gov/e-reading-room   \n \nStay Motion Addendum 258\n1 \n   \n\n(283 of 348), Page 283 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 283 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 2 of 6\n \n1  allegations concerning the termination of a portion of the Acacia contract for the provision of UAC legal \nservices in March.  I also have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances leading to the \n2 \ntermination decision at issue here. \n3 \n4.  Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”)2 is an ORR contractor who provides legal services \n4 \nand other assistance to UAC in and released from ORR care in the sectors defined by ORR, as explained \n5 \nbelow.  Acacia may further sub-award ORR funds to other organizations to provide these services.  In this \n6  posture, ORR has no direct relationship with these sub-awardees. Rather, as the federal contractor, Acacia \n7  is responsible under HHS regulations for, among other things, clearly identifying every sub-award as such, \nevaluating each subrecipient’s risk of noncompliance with Federal requirements, and monitoring \n8 \nsubrecipient activities to ensure the subaward is used for authorized purposes, identifying sub-awardees as \n9 \neither subrecipients or sub-contractors. See 45 CFR 75.352; see also 45 CFR 75.101(b)(1) (making 75.352 \n10 \napplicable to HHS contracts). \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n6.  Acacia has provided these services pursuant to Contract 140D0422C0009. \n17 \n7.  Collectively, these services cost ACF/ORR—and by extension U.S. taxpayers—a grand \n18 \ntotal of $796,720,624.01. \n19  8.  On February 3, 2025, Acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink issued the “Secretarial \n20  Directive on Program Payment Integrity” (“Secretarial Directive”), which directed all HHS personnel to \nbriefly pause all payments to contractors, vendors, and grantees related to immigration and refugee \n21 \nresettlement for internal review.  A true and correct copy of the Secretarial Directive is attached hereto as \n22 \n“Exhibit 1.”   \n23 \n9.  Specifically, the Secretarial Directive directed that “Agency personnel shall briefly pause \n24 \nall payments made by the Administration for Children and Families to contractors, vendors, and grantees \n25  related to immigration and refugee resettlement for internal review for payment integrity.  Such review \n26  shall include but not be limited to a review for fraud, waste, abuse, and a review of the overall contracts \n27 \n28 \n \n2 Acacia was previously known as the Vera Institute of Justice, or “Vera.” \n \nStay Motion Addendum 259\n2 \n   \n\n(284 of 348), Page 284 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 284 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 3 of 6\n \n1  and grants to determine whether those contracts or grants are in the best interest of the government and \nconsistent with current policy.”  Exhibit 1. \n2 \n10.  In late February, all ORR contracts, including the contract for legal services, were \n3 \nevaluated for termination and modification to reduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to \n4 \npromote efficiency and advance the policies of the President’s Administration. The evaluation consisted of \n5 \nmaking a determination of whether the contracted services were legally required, whether the services \n6  provided by the vendor aligned with the administration’s priorities, and whether the services could be \n7  provided through other means more cost effectively. During that time period, ORR leadership determined \nthat the contract for legal services was only partially required in order to meet statutory requirements and \n8 \ndecided to reduce the scope of the contract in order to reduce spending and achieve more cost efficiency. \n9 \n11.  As a result of the program integrity review conducted pursuant to the Secretarial \n10 \nDirective, ACF and ORR leadership decided, on or about March 20, 2025, to partially terminate the \n11 \nAcacia contract—which was already set to expire on March 29, 2025—with respect to the funding of \n12 \ndirect representation of UAC; however, ACF/ORR decided to renew the Acacia contract with respect to \n13  the provision of KYR trainings and legal screenings, based on its understanding of its non-discretionary \nobligations, and in keeping with the Administration’s general policy of protecting the public fisc by \n14 \nensuring taxpayer dollars are only spent on statutorily-required government-funded services. \n15 \n12.  Accordingly, on March 21, 2025, Acacia was notified of the partial termination decision \n16 \nby the Acquisition Services Directorate of the Interior Business Center within the Department of the \n17 \nInterior (“DOI”).  A true and correct copy of the Acacia partial termination notice is attached hereto as \n18 \n“Exhibit 2.”   \n19  13.  DOI provides assisted acquisition services to HHS and its component agencies, including \n20  ACF/ORR, under the Interior Franchise Fund.3  Simply put, DOI serves as the technical administrator of \nthe Acacia contract, due to its greater capacity for contract management and administration, but \n21 \nACF/ORR remains the decisionmaker with respect to all aspects of the Acacia contract, and, for that \n22 \nmatter, the development and implementation of all UAC policies, as expressly directed by Congress.  See \n23 \n6 U.S.C. §279(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1232.  DOI merely communicates those decisions to the contractor on \n24 \nACF/ORR’s behalf.  Hence, the partial termination letter Acacia received was from DOI, not ACF/ORR. \n25 \n \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 260\n3 \n   \n\n(285 of 348), Page 285 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 285 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 4 of 6\n \n1  14.  As stated in the partial termination letter, ORR has determined to terminate aspects of the \nAcacia contract related to direct representation of UAC because the TVPRA does not require HHS/ORR \n2 \nto fund direct legal representation. Under the TVPRA, at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(5), the Secretary of HHS must \n3 \n“ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1362),” \n4 \nthat all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in its custody or in the custody of DHS, with \n5 \ncertain exceptions, have counsel “to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \n6  mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” The Secretary of Health and Human Services “shall make \n7  every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to such \nchildren without charge.” 8 U.S.C. 1362 provides, “In any removal proceedings before an immigration \n8 \njudge and in any appeal proceedings before the Attorney General from any such removal proceedings, the \n9 \nperson concerned shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) by \n10 \nsuch counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose.” (emphasis added). ORR has \n11 \nfor several years funded at great public expense direct legal representation services for unaccompanied \n12 \nalien children. The TVPRA which authorizes such funding, does not require it, and such services are \n13  entirely at the agency’s discretion. \n15.  ORR’s regulations were written based on the understanding that it is responsible for \n14 \nproviding access to counsel, but at no expense to the government. See 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34526-27 \n15 \n(prefacing discussion of 45 CFR 410.1309 with an explanation of requirements under the TVPRA). Thus, \n16 \neven where ORR regulations describe funding direct representation of UAC (e.g., 45 CFR \n17 \n410.1309(a)(4)), the regulations state that such funding is provided “[t]o the extent ORR determines that \n18 \nappropriations are available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.” As a \n19  result, although historically ORR has funded direct representation, it has done so as a matter of its \n20  exclusive discretion.  Like many discretionary policies, this one has changed with the change in \nAdministration, and ORR has now determined that it will no longer fund direct representation for UAC. \n21 \n16.  Congress periodically appropriates funds to support ORR’s UAC program, including legal \n22 \nservices.  Appropriations language, however, consistently remains broad and nonspecific regarding \n23 \nprecise funding allocations.  For example, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. \n24 \n118-47, provides general appropriations to execute activities under Section 235 of the TVPRA without \n25  earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal representation.  This general appropriation approach allows \n26  ORR flexibility in determining the allocation of resources based on agency priorities, the availability of \npro bono counsel, and shifting immigration policy needs.  Subsequent acts, including the Full-Year \n27 \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding \n28 \n \nStay Motion Addendum 261\n4 \n   \n\n(286 of 348), Page 286 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 286 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 5 of 6\n \nlevels and provide broad discretion without altering statutory obligations or imposing specific mandates \nfor funding legal representation. \n17.  Had Acacia never entered into a contract with the United States to provide direct legal \nservices to UAC, Plaintiffs would have never received funding to provide such legal services. Under the \nFoundation Rule, HHS would maintain the discretion to determine whether to fund direct-legal services \nfor UAC, and, using that discretion, it would likely continue to decline to continue funding. Moreover,  \nwhile it has cancelled aspects of the Acacia contract pertaining to direct representation of UAC, ORR has \nnot canceled those aspects pertaining to the provision of the KYR trainings and legal screenings because \nORR’s regulations require the provision of both the KYR presentation and the legal screening.  See 45 \nCFR 410.1309(a)(2)(i) and (v).  \n18.  The termination of the Acacia contract is in the public’s best interest as almost $800 \nmillion has been spent on legal services, much of which is not legally mandated, and to continue funding \nsuch services that are not legally required does not fulfill this Administration’s policy goals of reducing \nunnecessary public expenditures. The law gives HHS discretion on how to use ORR’s funding and given \nthe priorities to reduce public expenditures, ORR has directed such funding be curtailed.  \n19.  ORR has not made any commitment or representation to Plaintiffs, including Acacia or \nany other entity involved in this case, that it would continue funding direct legal services through their \ncontracts. The decision to fund such services, if continued, remains subject to the agency’s discretion, \nappropriations, and programmatic priorities. There is no obligation under the applicable statutes or \nregulations that mandates HHS to maintain contractual relationships with specific service providers, \nincluding the Plaintiffs in this matter. \n20.  Despite the recent change in the scope of the Acacia contract, ORR will continue to ensure \nUAC in the agency’s custody are provided KYR presentations and legal screenings through the use of \nlegal service providers whether through awards or subawards. \n21.  Under the renewed contract, ACF/ORR will still pay $27,318.224.88 remaining costs to \nAcacia to provide KYR Trainings and legal screenings on a go-forward basis. \n22.  UAC have, and remain, free to retain any attorney they wish to represent them in any \nmatter they wish to contest at no cost to the Government, and Plaintiffs and any other legal service \nproviders remains free to provide direct legal services on a truly pro bono basis. Legal service providers \nwho wish to provide pro bono services may contact the agency to have their contact information updated \nand included in ORR’s Legal Resource Guide – Legal Service Provider List which provides a state by \nstate breakdown on legal service providers. Lists of local attorneys are provided to UAC when they enter \ncare and when they leave it. The Legal Service Guide also provides weblinks to other pro bono resources \nStay Motion Addendum 262\n5 \n \n\n(287 of 348), Page 287 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 287 of 348\n1  from the Immigration Advocates Network and the U.S. Department of Justice’s List of Pro Bono Legal \nService Providers. The Legal Resource Guide is provided to children within 24 hours of their admission \n2 \ninto an ORR care provider. \n3 \n23. ACF/ORR complies with all federal laws and regulations. Requiring the agency to provide\n4 \ndirect representation for UAC prohibits the discretion Congress intentionally conferred upon HHS. \n5 \n24. Further, ACF/ORR is concerned that large multimillion dollar contracts create a market\n6  for paid legal service providers to take on cases, which disincentivizes the recruitment of and the \n7  volunteering of pro bono counsel. Notably, many jurisdictions require or encourage attorneys to take on \ncases for indignant clients or cases in the public interest pro bono and have annual reporting requirements \n8 \nfor attorneys to report those hours. A large influx of public funding for direct representation therefore may \n9 \nhave the perverse effect of discouraging the utilization of pro bono counsel in the first instance. \n10 \n11 \nExecuted on March 31, 2025. \n12 \n13 \n_______________________________________ \n14 \nToby Biswas \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nStay Motion Addendum 263\n6 \n\n(288 of 348), Page 288 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 288 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-2     Filed 03/31/25     Page 1 of 2\nExhibit 1. \nStay Motion Addendum 264\n\n(289 of 348), Page 289 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 289 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-2     Filed 03/31/25     Page 2 of 2\nStay Motion Addendum 265\n\n(290 of 348), Page 290 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 290 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-3     Filed 03/31/25     Page 1 of 2\n   \nUnited States Department of the Interior \nINTERIOR BUSINESS CENTER \nWashington, DC 20240   \n \n \n \n \nMarch 21, 2025 \n \nTo:     Leah Prestamo \n    Acacia Center for Justice \n1025 Connecticut Avenue NW \nSuite 1000A \nWashington, DC 20036 \n \nSubject:   Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience \n \nContract 140D0422C0009, awarded on March 29, 2022, by the United States Department of the \nInterior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families \n(ACF), Office Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as a part of our Interagency Agreement for acquisition \nservices, is hereby partially terminated for the Government’s convenience.

Having considered Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendants’ response, and the arguments of \n22  the Parties at the April 1, 2025 hearing, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ emergency Motion \n23  for a Temporary Restraining Order, effective 8:00 a.m. on April 2, 2025.

The Court enters the \n2  following findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the maintenance of status quo ante \n3  pending further briefing from the parties. \n4  I.  BACKGROUND \n5  Plaintiffs previously received funding for their work from ORR disbursed through Acacia \n6  Center for Justice.  Compl. ¶¶ 64-65; 88.  Defendants issued a letter to Acacia Center for Justice \n7  on March 21, 2025, terminating the contract line items through which HHS and ORR provided \n8  funding for counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration court.  Compl. ¶ 11; Biswas Decl., \n9  Ex. 2 (ECF 24-3, the “Cancellation Order”).  The letter ordered Plaintiffs to “immediately stop all \n10  work” on their ongoing funded representations.  Id.  Plaintiffs share the mission of ensuring legal \n11  representation for the thousands of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings \n12  throughout the country.  Compl. ¶ 102.  Congress has consistently appropriated funds for this \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  purpose, including the most recent appropriation for over $5 billion to ensure “all children . . . \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  have access to counsel in their immigration proceedings.”  Compl. ¶¶ 77-87. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Plaintiffs contend that the Government’s Cancellation Order violates its obligations under \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), \nd Srn \nee 17  which requires that the Government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent them in “legal proceedings” and to \n19  “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  Pub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), \n20  122 Stat. 5044, 5079.  Plaintiffs argue that the Cancellation Order additionally violates the \n21  Government’s obligations under ORR’s own “Foundational Rule,” which requires the \n22  Government to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation” to \n23  unaccompanied children if there are “available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a \n24  legal orientation, consultation with a lawyer, and ongoing access to lawyers. 45 C.F.R. \n25  § 410.1309(a) (2024).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ Cancellation Order conflicts with these \n26  legal requirements and thus violates the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n27  Compl. ¶¶ 127-46. \n28 \n2 \n\n(295 of 348), Page 295 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 295 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 3 of 7\n \n1  In response to the Cancellation Order, Plaintiffs state that they are forced to choose \n2  between few harsh alternatives, including continuing to provide unfunded legal representation in \n3  the face of limited resources; cutting other vital organizational programs; laying off, furloughing, \n4  or terminating staff; or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing representation duties.  See, e.g., \n5  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21.   \n6  II.  DISCUSSION \n7  The Court has jurisdiction over Defendants and the subject matter of this action.  See \n8  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702.  Contrary to the Government’s assertions, this is \n9  not a contract dispute in which Plaintiffs seek money damages such that their suit belongs before \n10  the Federal Court of Claims.  Pacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-255-JNW, 2025 WL 893530, at *4-7 \n11  (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025).  A temporary restraining order against Defendants, as provided \n12  below, is necessary until the Court can consider Plaintiff States’ forthcoming motion for a \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  preliminary injunction. \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  A.

Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, \n2  668 (citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, \n3  225 (2012)).  In sum, Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit.   \n4  B.  Entitlement to Temporary Relief \n5  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 authorizes a trial court to grant a temporary restraining \n6  order “to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a final judgment issues in the \n7  cause.”  See Ramos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872, 887 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC \n8  Bank N.V., 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010)).  The status quo in this context “refers not simply \n9  to any situation before the filing of a lawsuit, but instead to ‘the last uncontested status which \n10  preceded the pending controversy[.]’ ”  GoTo.com, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1210 \n11  (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, 809 (9th Cir. \n12  1963)).  “The standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is identical to the standard for \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  issuing a preliminary injunction.”  Lockheed Missile & Space Co. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 887 F. \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Supp. 1320, 1323 (N.D. Cal. 1995). \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show: (1) a likelihood of \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm to the moving party in the absence of \nd Srn \nee 17  preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in the favor of the moving party, and (4) an \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n19  (2008).  Where the government is a party, courts merge the analysis of the final two Winters \n20  factors, the balance of equities and the public interest.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d \n21  1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Courts “explore the \n22  relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.”  Barnes \n23  v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (internal \n24  quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Winters factors may be evaluated on a sliding scale, \n25  such that preliminary relief may be issued when the moving party demonstrates “that serious \n26  questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the \n27  plaintiff’s favor.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011) \n28  (citation omitted). \n4 \nStay Motion Addendum 272\n\n(297 of 348), Page 297 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 297 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 5 of 7\n \n1  Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs raise serious questions going to the merits.  In \n2  particular, the TVPRA requires that the government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n3  practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal \n4  proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. \n5  § 1232(c)(5).  The Government argues that HHS’s funding decisions under the TVPRA and the \n6  Foundational Rule remain discretionary and do not mandate funding of direct legal representation \n7  such as that provided by Plaintiffs.  But this raises a “serious question” going to the merits – \n8  whether the TVPRA requires the Government to ensure the provision of counsel for unrepresented \n9  children in immigration proceedings prior to the cancellation of funding for direct legal \n10  representation by organizations such as Plaintiffs.  This serious question weighs in favor of \n11  reinstating the status quo ante while the record and the parties’ arguments are developed further. \n12  Plaintiffs have also shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  preliminary relief.  Defendants’ termination of funding has impacted Plaintiffs, forcing them to \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  issue layoff notices and threatening to require them to dismiss their highly-specialized and \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  seasoned attorneys.  See ImmDef Decl. ¶¶ 20-23.  Relevant to the issue of standing raised above, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Defendants’ termination of funding for direct legal representation directly interferes with \nd Srn \nee 17  Plaintiffs’ missions, impeding their ability to provide the direct legal representation of \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings that is fundamental to Plaintiffs’ core \n19  activities.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 22; VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 21-22; NWIRP ¶¶ 13-15.  The irreparable harm \n20  resulting from Defendants’ actions weighs in favor of temporary injunctive relief. \n21  The Government argues that it would suffer harm in the form of being compelled to spend \n22  down congressionally appropriated funds for the unaccompanied children in immigration \n23  proceedings during the pendency of the preliminary injunctive relief.  Not so.  Terminating \n24  funding for direct legal representation for unaccompanied children, without any plan to ensure \n25  continuity in representation, potentially violates Congress’s express directive in the TVRPA and \n26  ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.  Moreover, courts regularly find that “[t]here \n27  is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women \n28  Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citations omitted).  “To the \n5 \nStay Motion Addendum 273\n\n(298 of 348), Page 298 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 298 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 6 of 7\n \n1  contrary, there is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the \n2  federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’ ”  Id. (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 \n3  F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  The Government fails to convince that it would suffer harm at \n4  this stage. \n5  On the other hand, the maintenance of funding for direct legal representation services \n6  furthers the critical public interests of ensuring children have access to legal representation and \n7  protection from human trafficking.  Indeed, ORR itself recognizes “that most unaccompanied \n8  children need legal services to resolve their immigration status and that representation appears to \n9  have a significant impact on both the court appearance rate and the outcome of cases for \n10  unaccompanied children.”  Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529; see also id. at 34526 \n11  (stating ORR’s goal of “100 percent legal representation of unaccompanied children.”).  The Court \n12  additionally finds that the continued funding of legal representation for unaccompanied children \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  promotes efficiency and fairness within the immigration system.  See generally Br. for Amicus \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Curiae Former Immigration Judges & Former Members of the Board of Immigration Appeals \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  (ECF 28).  A temporary restraining order enjoining the Cancellation Order serves the public \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  interest. \nd Srn \nee 17  In sum, the balance of equities tips sharply toward the Plaintiffs and the public interest \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  strongly weighs in favor of entering temporary relief. \n19  // \n20  // \n21  // \n22  // \n23  // \n24  // \n25  // \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n6 \nStay Motion Addendum 274\n\n(299 of 348), Page 299 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 299 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 7 of 7\n \n1  III.  TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n2  For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for Temporary \n3  Restraining Order.  The Court hereby ORDERS that: \n \n4  Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of \n5  March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), \n6  and ORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), \nparticularly ORR’s provision of funds for direct legal representation \n7  services to unaccompanied children.  This injunction precludes \ncutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its \n8  duration. \n9  The Court deems no security bond is required under Rule 65(c).

The Order \n9 \nalso enjoins Defendants from “cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its duration.” \n10 \nId.  \n11 \nIn Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion requesting the TRO, Defendants argued that the \n12 \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) only waives sovereign immunity over actions seeking relief “other \n13 \nthan monetary damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702;  see also N. Star Alaska v. United States, 14 F.3d 36, 38 (9th \n14 \nCir. 1994) (The APA “does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking equitable relief.” ) \n15 \n(cleaned up); see also RAJMP, Inc. v. United States, No. 19-CV-876 AJB (WVG), 2020 WL 905592, at \n16 \n*4 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2020) (“The Ninth Circuit has held several times that the APA does not waive \n17 \nsovereign immunity over non-monetary, contract-based claims because the Tucker Act impliedly forbids \n18 \nequitable relief.”). TRO Opp., 16 (ECF No. 24). Specifically, Defendants argued that the APA does not \n19 \nprovide a waiver of sovereign immunity in this case because the relief Plaintiffs seek is payment. TRO \n20 \nOpp., 16.   Additionally, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the Tucker Act because \n21 \nthe rights that they seek to enforce and the relief that they seek is only available to them through contract. \n22 \nTRO Opp., 18-20 (citing United States Conf. of Cath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:25-CV-00465, \n23 \n2025 WL 763738, at *2, 7 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025) (holding that claim requiring the government to keep \n24 \npaying, though styled as an injunction, was “founded upon a contract” and “must be heard in Claims \n25 \nCourt.”)). Despite the fact that a TRO would require Defendants to pay funds to Plaintiffs, and that their \n26 \nonly entitlement to the funds was based on a contract, the Court ruled that “this is not a contract dispute \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  Stay Motion Addendum 279\n30 \n\n(304 of 348), Page 304 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 304 of 348\n \n \n \n1  in which Plaintiffs seek money damages such that their suit belongs before the Federal Court of Claims,” \n2  and granted the TRO. TRO, 3. \n3  Only days after the Court issued the TRO, the Supreme Court issued a decision today that at least \n4  severely undermines this Court’s assertion of jurisdiction over this case—if it is not outright controlling \n5  here. Specifically, the Supreme Court vacated a temporary restraining order enjoining the government \n6  from terminating various education-related grants.  Dep’t of Education v. California, No. 24A910, 2025 \n7  WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (Attached as “Ex. A”).  Like this case, the plaintiffs there filed \n8  their claims under the APA, even though they ultimately sought monetary relief under governmental \n9  contracts. Id. The Court held that the government is “likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked \n10  jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.” Id. The Court reasoned that APA does not \n11  waive sovereign immunity over cases where a statute either grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly \n12  forbids the relief which is sought, such as the Tucker Act’s implied preclusion of review over contract \n13  claims in courts other than the Court of Federal Claims. Id. (citing 5 U. S. C. § 702). It further explained \n14  that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for suits involving monetary relief. Id. “Instead, the \n15  Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on “‘any express or implied \n16  contract with the United States.’” Id. (citing 28 U. S. C. § 1491(a)(1)).  \n17  The Supreme Court’s decision confirms that Plaintiffs cannot show that they are likely to prevail \n18  on the merits of their claims, and that this Court very likely lacked jurisdiction to issue a temporary \n19  restraining order requiring the government to pay funds, where Plaintiffs’ only entitlement to the funds \n20  was through a contract. Rather, as the Court noted, Plaintiffs here must bring their claims in the Court of \n21  Federal Claims. Id. The Supreme Court’s decision is thus an intervening change in the controlling law that \n22  warrants vacatur of this Court’s TRO. \n23  ARGUMENT \n \n24  A.  Legal Standard for Dissolving a Temporary Restraining Order. \n \n25  A party may seek dissolution of a TRO or preliminary injunction based on a material change in \n26 \nfacts or law that warrants revision or dissolution.  See Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1198 (9th Cir. \n27 \n2019) (per curiam) (citing Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000)).  The test for dissolving \n28 \nor modifying an injunction has two parts.  The moving party must show: (1) a significant change in fact \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2  Stay Motion Addendum 280\n30 \n\n(305 of 348), Page 305 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 305 of 348\n \n \n \n1  or law; and (2) that in light of the significant change, the injunction should be dissolved or modified under \n2 \nthe legal standard that governed the issuance of the injunction in the first place.  See Karnoski, 926 F.3d \n3 \nat 1198 & n.14; Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1170.  A subsequent challenge to a preliminary injunction “must rest \n4 \non grounds that could not have been raised before.”  Alto v. Black, 738 F.3d 1111, 1120 (9th Cir. 2013) \n5 \n(citation omitted).  Here, Department of Education v. California is a significant change warranting \n6 \ndissolution, and it could not have been raised before because it was issued earlier today.  \n7 \n8  B.  Dep’t of Education v. California is a Significant Change in Law. \n9  “[E]vents have largely overtaken this litigation.”  See Martinez v. Wilson, 32 F.3d 1415, 1419 (9th \n10 \nCir. 1994).  The Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education v. California significantly shifted \n11 \nthe legal landscape governing the federal government’s authority to terminate funding, affirming the \n12 \ndiscretion of federal agencies to make funding determinations without judicial interference.  This decision \n13 \ndirectly impacts the Court’s prior issuance of the TRO in this case, as the TRO was based on a premise \n14 \nthat the government lacked discretion to terminate funding for legal representation under the TVPRA and \n15 \n16  Foundational Rule. \n17  The TRO enjoined Defendants from withdrawing ORR-funded legal representation services, based \n18 \nin part on the Court’s interpretation that the TVPRA mandates ongoing funding for legal services for \n19 \nunaccompanied children.  However, the Supreme Court’s decision clarified that federal agencies retain \n20 \nthe discretion to terminate or alter funding arrangements when they deem it necessary, particularly when \n21 \nappropriations are limited or policy priorities evolve.  Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL \n22 \n1008354, at *2 (“[T]he APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a \n23 \n24  contractual obligation to pay money[.]’”) (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 \n25 \nU. S. 204, 212 (2002)); see id. **1-2.   \n26 \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court’s ruling highlights that the Judiciary should not interfere with \n27 \nagency funding decisions absent clear statutory mandates.  Id. at **1-2.  The decision emphasized that \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3  Stay Motion Addendum 281\n30 \n\n(306 of 348), Page 306 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 306 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 7 of 10\n \n \n \n1  maintaining funding contrary to agency determinations improperly encroaches on executive discretion.  \n2 \nId.  Therefore, the significant change in controlling law established by Dep’t of Education v. California \n3 \nwarrants dissolving the TRO, as the legal basis for the Court’s prior order has been substantially \n4 \nundermined. \n5 \nC.  Dep’t of Education v. California Warrants Dissolution of the TRO. \n6 \nWhen courts assess whether a change “warrants . . . dissolution of the injunction,” the “inquiry \n7 \n8  should be guided by the same criteria that govern the issuance of a preliminary injunction.”1  Karnoski, \n9  926 F.3d at 1198 (quoting Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1170).  District courts have applied these instructions from \n10 \nKarnoski in several ways.  See Lo v. Cnty. of Siskiyou, 2022 WL 1505909, at *7 (E.D. Cal. May 12, 2022) \n11 \n(listing cases).  The Lo Court observed that one district court required the movant to show an injunction \n12 \nis unwarranted under each of the four criteria, whereas another district court concluded that the defendant \n13 \nmay prevail by disproving any one or more of the four criteria.  Id. (citing CW Baice Ltd. v. Wisdomobile \n14 \nGrp. Ltd., No. 20-03526, 2021 WL 3053147, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 20, 2021); Index Newspapers LLC v. \n15 \n16  City of Portland, No. 20-1035, 2022 WL 72124, at *9 (D. Or. Jan. 7, 2022)).  Ultimately, the Lo Court \n17  “borrowed the terms of Karnoski,” to conclude that a district court may be “guided by” the “traditional” \n18 \nstandard for injunctive relief and “address” each part of that standard without applying the standard \n19 \nmechanically or as a checklist.  Id. (citing Karnoski, 926 F.3d at 1199, 1202) (cleaned up).  “This more \n20 \nflexible interpretation recognizes district courts’ wide discretion to ensure their injunctions are just and to \n21 \nfit  those  injunctions  to  the  evolving  circumstances  of  each  case.”    Id.  (quotations  and  internal \n22 \nmodifications omitted); see also id., at *8 (“Viewing the question in this way demonstrates why a \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n1 Under those criteria, plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctions must establish that: (1) they are likely to \n26 \nsucceed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. \n27 \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  But “[w]here, as here, the government opposes a \npreliminary injunction, the third and fourth factors merge into one inquiry.”  Porretti v. Dzurenda, 11 F.4th \n28 \n1037, 1047 (9th Cir. 2021). \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4  Stay Motion Addendum 282\n30 \n\n(307 of 348), Page 307 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 307 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 8 of 10\n \n \n \n1  defendant who seeks to modify or dissolve an injunction should not be required to prove that each element \n2 \nof the four-part test weighs in its favor.”). \n3 \nAs applied here, Dep’t of Education v. California warrants dissolution of the TRO.  First, Plaintiffs \n4 \ncannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Court’s TRO was premised on the \n5 \nconclusion that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the APA.  TRO, 3.  \n6 \nThe Court’s TRO rested on the presumption that Plaintiffs could enforce ORR’s funding obligations \n7 \n8  through the APA.  However, under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Department of Education v. \n9  California, such relief is explicitly unavailable, as the APA's waiver of sovereign immunity does not \n10 \nextend to enforcing contractual obligations or compelling the government to pay money. See 2025 WL \n11 \n1008354, at 2. Given that the APA provided the sole jurisdictional basis for the TRO, the Supreme Court’s \n12 \nruling eliminates Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits. \n13 \nSecond, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate irreparable injury because any funding-related harm can be \n14 \nremedied through monetary relief in the appropriate forum.  As the Supreme Court emphasized in \n15 \n16  Department of Education, where plaintiffs retain the ability to seek reimbursement of withheld funds \n17  through an appropriate suit, the harm alleged is monetary and does not rise to the level of irreparable injury \n18 \nwarranting injunctive relief.  2025 WL 1008354, at 2.  Here, Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries stem solely from \n19 \nthe termination of funding—an injury explicitly remediable through monetary damages in the proper \n20 \nvenue, such as a claim under the Tucker Act.  Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to meet the irreparable harm \n21 \nthreshold necessary to sustain the TRO. \n22 \nMoreover, as the Supreme Court also observed, it is the government—not the Plaintiffs—that faces \n23 \n24  irreparable injury from the disbursement of funds unlikely ever to be recovered once they are disbursed.  \n25 \nDep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, at 2.  Like the plaintiffs in Dep’t of Education v. \n26 \nCalifornia, none of the Plaintiffs here “promised to return withdrawn funds should its grant termination \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5  Stay Motion Addendum 283\n30 \n\n(308 of 348), Page 308 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 308 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 9 of 10\n \n \n \n1  be reinstated,” and this Court declined to impose bond under Rule 65(c).  Id.; TRO, 7.  Thus, Plaintiffs \n2 \nfail to satisfy the irreparable harm threshold necessary to sustain the TRO. \n3 \nThird,  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  underscores  the  government’s  significant  interest  in \n4 \nmaintaining  discretion over funding decisions to  ensure that appropriations reflect  evolving policy \n5 \npriorities and fiscal considerations.  Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, at 2. Judicial \n6 \ninterference with this discretion not only disrupts agency management of limited resources but also \n7 \n8  undermines the public interest by constraining the government's ability to effectively allocate taxpayer \n9  funds.  Given the clarity of the Supreme Court’s instruction, neither the balance of equities nor the public \n10 \ninterest favors continuation of the TRO.  On the contrary, these factors strongly support dissolving the \n11 \nTRO to align with current controlling authority. \n12 \nAlternatively, the Court should stay the TRO to prevent the government from losing funds that \n13 \nthis Court likely lacked jurisdiction to disburse.  See Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, \n14 \nat 2. For all of the same reasons explained above, in prior briefing, and now in Department of Education \n15 \n16  v. California, a stay pending potential appeal is warranted here. \n17  CONCLUSION \n18 \nThe legal basis on which the TRO rested has, as the case law puts it, evaporated.  Accordingly, the \n19 \nCourt should dissolve the TRO. Alternatively, this Court should stay the TRO pending an appeal by the \n20 \ngovernment. \n21 \n \n22 \n \n23 \n \n \n24 \n   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6  Stay Motion Addendum 284\n30 \n\n(309 of 348), Page 309 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 309 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 10 of 10\n \n \n \n1  DATED: April 4, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

The District Court’s conclusion rested on a finding \nthat respondents are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 60 \nStat. 237. On March 26, the Government filed this applica-\n-\ntended on March 24) and requested an immediate adminis-\ntrative stay.  The application was presented to JUSTICE  \nJACKSON and by her referred to the Court. \n  Although the Courts of Appeals generally lack appellate \njurisdiction over appeals from TROs, several factors counsel \nin favor of construing the District Court’s order as an ap-\npealable preliminary injunction.  Among other considera-\ntions, the District Court’s order carries many of the hall-\nmarks of a preliminary injunction.  See Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U. S. 61, 87 (1974); Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. 579, 594 \n(2018). Moreover, the District Court’s “basis for issuing the \norder [is] strongly challenged,” as the Government is likely  \n \nStay Motion Addendum 288\n\n(313 of 348), Page 313 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 313 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. CALIFORNIA  \n   \nPer Curiam  \nto succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction \nto order the payment of money under the APA.   Sampson, \n415 U. S., at 87.  The APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity \ndoes not apply “if any other statute that grants consent to \nsuit  expressly  or  impliedly  forbids  the  relief  which  is \nsought.”  5 U. S. C. §702.  Nor does the waiver apply to\nclaims seeking “money damages.”  Ibid.  True, a district  \ncourt’s jurisdiction “is not barred by the possibility” that  an \norder setting aside an agency’s action may result in the dis-\nbursement of funds.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S.  \n879, 910 (1988).  But, as we have recognized, the APA’s lim-\nited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders “to en-\nforce a contractual obligation to pay money” along the lines \nof what the District Court ordered here.  Great-West Life &  \nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. 204, 212 (2002).  In-\nstead, the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims \njurisdiction over suits based on “any express or implied con-\ntract with the United States.”  28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).\n  As for the remaining stay factors, respondents have not \nrefuted the Government’s representation that it is unlikely \nto recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.  No  \ngrantee “promised to return withdrawn funds should its \ngrant termination be reinstated,” and the District Court de-\nclined to impose bond. App. to Application To Vacate Order \n15a, 17a. By contrast, the Government compellingly argues \nthat respondents would not suffer irreparable harm while\nthe TRO is stayed.  Respondents have represented in this \nlitigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep \ntheir programs running. So, if respondents ultimately pre-\nvail,  they  can  recover  any  wrongfully  withheld  funds \nthrough suit in an appropriate forum.  And if respondents \ninstead decline to keep the programs operating, then any \nensuing irreparable harm would be of their own making.  \n“Such self-imposed costs are not properly the subject of in-\nquiry on a motion for stay.”  Cuomo v. NRC, 772 F. 2d 972,  \n977 (CADC 1985) (per curiam).  \n \n\n(314 of 348), Page 314 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 314 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U.

The March 10, 2025 or-\nder and March 24, 2025 extension of the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25– \ncv–10548, is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and \ndisposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ \nis timely sought. Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall \nterminate automatically. In the event certiorari is granted, \nthe stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judg-\nment of this Court.  \n \nIt is so ordered. \n \n \nStay Motion Addendum 290\n\n(315 of 348), Page 315 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 315 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 5 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U.

Nowhere in its papers does the Government de-\nfend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue \nhere.  And contra the per curiam, the respondent States \nhave consistently represented that the loss of these grants\nwill force them—indeed, has already forced them—to cur-\ntail teacher training programs.  See, e.g., Brief in Opposi-\ntion to Application 39–40; App. to Application To Vacate Or-\nder 7a–8a, 34a–35a.  The remaining issue is whether this \nsuit,  brought  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act\n(APA), belongs in an ordinary district court or  the Court of \nFederal Claims.  As the Court acknowledges, the general \nrule is that APA actions go to district courts, even when a \nremedial order “may result in the disbursement of funds.”  \nAnte, at 2 (citing Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879,  \n910 (1988)).  To support a different result here, the Court \nrelies exclusively on Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v.  \nKnudson, 534 U. S. 204 (2002).  But Great-West  was not  \nbrought under the APA, as the Court took care to note. See \nid., at 212 (distinguishing Bowen for that reason).  So the  \nCourt’s reasoning is at the least under-developed, and very \npossibly wrong.\n  The  risk  of  error  increases  when  this  Court  decides  \nStay Motion Addendum 291\n\n(316 of 348), Page 316 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 316 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 6 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v.

And there will of course be \ngood-faith disagreements about when that is called for.  But \nin my view, nothing about this case demanded our immedi-\nate intervention.

The District Court issued a temporary restraining or-\nder (TRO) finding that the Department’s decision was likely \nunlawful and pausing the grant cancellations while the \ncourt considers a pending motion for a preliminary injunc-\ntion.  The TRO expires in three days, and it will become \nmoot even earlier if the District Court rules on the prelimi-\nnary-injunction motion this week. \n  With the TRO on its last legs, a majority of this Court has \nchosen to dive into this dispute today, allowing the Depart-\nment to implement immediately its new summary grant-\ntermination policy.   It does so  even though the TRO preserves \nthe pretermination status quo and causes zero concrete  \nharm to the Government.  By  contrast, reinstating the chal-\nlenged grant-termination policy will inflict significant harm \non grantees—a fact that the Government barely contests.  \nWorse still, the Government does not even deign to defend \nthe lawfulness of its actions.  Instead, it asks us to superin-\ntend the lower courts’ real-time decisions about ancillary \nStay Motion Addendum 293\n\n(318 of 348), Page 318 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 318 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 8 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v.

It is like-\nwise baffling that anyone is persuaded that the equities fa-\nvor the Government when the Government does not even  \nargue that the lower courts erred in concluding that it likely \nbehaved unlawfully. This application should have been de-\nnied for numerous obvious and independent reasons, and \nthe Court does itself—and the legal process—no favors in \ndeciding to grant it.  \nI \nA \n  To address a nationwide shortage of qualified teachers, \nCongress has enacted several competitive grant programs \nthat facilitate the recruitment, training, and support of ed-\nucators. This application concerns the Department’s recent \nefforts to terminate grants that were awarded under two \nsuch programs: the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) pro-\ngram and the Supporting Effective Educator  Development \n(SEED) program. \n  Congress established the TQP program in 2008, author-\nizing the Department to award grants to high-need educa-\ntional  agencies  and  schools  for  the  purpose  of  training \nteachers.  20  U. S. C.  §§1021(6),  1022a(a),  1022a(c)(1), \n1022h.  In the statute that creates this program, Congress \nmade plain its intent to (1) “improve student achievement,” \n “improve the quality of . . . teachers,” (3) “hold teacher \npreparation programs at institutions of higher education \naccountable,” and (4) “recruit highly qualified individuals, \nincluding minorities and individuals from other occupa-\ntions, into the teaching force.”  §1022.\n  By  statute,  the  Department  awards  each  TQP  grant \nbased on a peer-review process “for a period of five years.”   \n§§1022b(a), (b)(3).  Similarly, under the SEED program, \nStay Motion Addendum 294\n\n(319 of 348), Page 319 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 319 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 9 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nCongress has mandated that the Department “shall award \ngrants” to institutions of higher education and nonprofit en-\ntities that provide certain education-related services, in-\ncluding “evidence-based professional development activi-\nties” for teachers. §§6672(a)(2), (f ).  Congress dictated that \n \nSEED grants “shall be” awarded for up to a 3-year period, \nsubject to a possible 2-year extension.  §§6672(b)(1)–(2). \n  On February 5, 2025, the Acting Secretary of Education is-\nsued an internal directive requiring Department personnel \nto review “‘issued grants’” to “‘ensur[e] that Department \n     \ngrants do not fund discriminatory practices’” that are “‘con-\n   \ntrary to law or to the Department’s policy objectives’” and \n \nthat “‘all grants are free from fraud, abuse, and duplica-\n \ntion.’”  App. to Application To Vacate Order 12a (App.).  The  \n \ndirective expressly extends to “‘practices . . . in the form of \n \n[diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”)].’”  Ibid. (alteration\n \nin original). \n  Two days later, TQP and SEED grant recipients began to \nreceive letters from the Department announcing the termi\nnation of their grant awards.  The letters were identical,  \nsave for differences in the addressees, grant-award num-\nbers, and termination dates.  Each letter included a single \nparagraph regarding the Department’s justification for the \ngrant termination, which stated, in full, as follows: \n“‘The grant specified above provides funding for pro-\n \ngrams that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or \nother initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or an-\nother protected characteristic; that violate either the \nletter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that con-\nflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education; that are not free \nfrom fraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail \nto serve the best interests of the United States.

See 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4); see also \n34 C.F.R. 75.253.”  Id., at 36–37. \nB \n  On March 6, 2025, eight States sued the Department in \nthe  District  of  Massachusetts,  claiming  that  this  mass,\nsummary termination of TQP and SEED grants was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, and not in accordance with law, in vi-\nolation  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (APA).  \n5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  The Plaintiff States alleged that, as \na result of the grant terminations, their public universities, \nschools, and other institutions “now face abrupt shortfalls \nto their current year budgets collectively exceeding ten mil-\nlion dollars.”   ECF Doc. 1, at 41.  As relevant, the Plaintiff \nStates sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside \nthe termination of the previously awarded grants.  They \nalso sought a TRO to immediately block termination of the \ngrants. \n  After holding a 2-hour hearing, the District Court issued \na TRO on March 10.

Supp. 3d ___, ___–___ (Mass. 2025), App. 9a– \n10a.  The order also contained an exception permitting the \nDepartment to make individual grant terminations con-\nsistent with applicable law and regulations. \n  By its terms, the TRO was “effective immediately” and \nwould “remain in effect for 14 days,” until March 24.  Id., at \n10a.  The District Court then separately construed the \nPlaintiff States’ TRO motion as a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction and set that motion for a hearing on March 28.  \nThe District Court subsequently extended the TRO for an \nadditional 14 days, until April 7, while also expressing its\n“intent that the TRO be temporary and short.”  ECF Doc.  \n79. \n  Seeking to enforce its termination decisions during the \nperiod in which the TRO remained in effect, the Govern-\nment requested a stay pending appeal.  The District Court \ndenied the request, as did a unanimous panel of the First \nCircuit.  The First Circuit panel assumed without deciding \nthat it had jurisdiction to review the TRO and  made several \ndeterminations, including: that the States were likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim that the Department’s \ntermination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious; that \nthe Government’s assertions of irreparable harm consisted \nof “speculation and hyperbole”; and that the equitable stay \nfactors cut against the Government.  ___ F. 4th ___, ___–___ \n(2025), App. 24a–35a.  The Government then turned to us \nfor an emergency stay. \nII  \n  First and foremost, the Government’s application should \nhave been swiftly denied because this Court lacks jurisdic-\ntion over this interlocutory order.  It is clear beyond cavil  \nthat, ordinarily, “orders granting . . . temporary restraining  \nStay Motion Addendum 297\n\n(322 of 348), Page 322 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 322 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 12 of 23\n6  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. CALIFORNIA  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \norders are not appealable.”  16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. \nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3922.1 (3d ed. \n2012).  This Court has recognized an exception for TROs \nand other interlocutory orders that are “potentially unlim-\nited” in duration, Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 87 \n(1974), and risk imposing a “‘serious, perhaps irreparable, \n \nconsequence,’” Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S.  \n \n79, 84 (1981).  But this time-limited TRO presents no such  \nthreat.  \n  To start, the District Court has merely ordered restora-\ntion of the “pre-existing status quo prior to the termination” \nof the grants in the Plaintiff States.  App. 9a.  Its order \ncomes in the form of an injunction only insofar as it has pro-\nhibited the Government from implementing the abruptly\nannounced terminations—the District Court has not or-\ndered that the Government do anything other than what \nwas required by law before the termination letters issued. \n  Notably, the TRO also includes an exception that permits \nthe  Government  to  make  individual  grant  terminations \nwhile the order is in effect “to the extent the final agency \naction is consistent with Congressional authorization and \nappropriations, relevant federal statute[s], including the \nrequirements of the APA, the requirements of the relevant \nimplementing regulations, [and] the grant terms and con-\nditions.”  Id., at 10a.

See ibid.  The Government provides \nno reason to believe that the District Court intends to ex-\ntend the order again.  Quite to the contrary, the fact that  \nthe District Court construed the Plaintiff States’ TRO mo-\ntion as a motion for a  preliminary injunction, and has al-\nready held a hearing, indicates that the court is moving \nwith dispatch and is in no way attempting to shield its in-\nterim order from appellate review.\n  This TRO thus falls squarely within the “general congres-\nIII  \n  Even assuming that the TRO is reviewable on appeal, the \nGovernment’s application does not demonstrate the sort of \nexigency that warrants emergency relief—what I have else-\nwhere called a “line-jumping justification,” Labrador v.

Even if the Government is  \nright about the merits of the arguments it raises in this ap-\nplication (which is doubtful), there is no reason why the \nGovernment cannot proceed through the usual litigation \nand appeals process to receive its vindication, as other liti-\ngants must.  To reiterate, the TRO expires  in  three days,  \nand the District Court held  a hearing on the Plaintiff \nStates’  preliminary-injunction motion a week ago.  The \nonly hint of urgency that the Government offers to justify \nits unusual request for our intervention is that, during the \nwaning  days  of  the  TRO  period,  some  grant  recipients \nmight seek to draw down grant funds that the Government \nwants to terminate. \n  If true, that would be unfortunate, but worse things have \nhappened.

Importantly, \nthere is no evidence that grantees have rushed to draw \ndown the remaining $65 million in grant funds since the\nDistrict Court entered the TRO 25 days ago.

Grant recipients are also closely supervised \nwith respect to such withdrawals: “The Department is au-\nthorized to monitor draw-down activity for all grants,” and \ncertain recipients are even “subject to an annual audit.”  Id., \nat 8–9. \n  Finally, even if the feared flood of recipient withdrawals\noccurs, the Government has various legal mechanisms to \nrecoup these kinds of funds.  See, e.g., 20 U. S. C. §§1234a, \n1234b; 2 CFR §200.346 (2024); see also J. Shaffer & D.  \nRamish, Federal Grant Practice §36:29 (2024 ed.) (“In the \nend, the Government usually gets its money”).  It is likely \nthat, given the Department’s new policy position with re-\nspect to terminations, it will be extra vigilant about record-\ning any withdrawals made while the TRO is in effect, so  \nthat the money can be clawed back if appropriate.  Thus,  \nthe alleged funding drain at which the Government ges-\ntures does not even appear to be irreparable.  The Govern-\nment has certainly not met its burden to show otherwise.  \nSee Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.

CALIFORNIA  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nIV \n  To review, the Court has now granted the Government’s \nrequest for “emergency” relief, staying a TRO that will ex-\npire in just three days in a case where appellate jurisdiction \nis wanting and the Government’s assertions of harm are il-\nlusory.  One might reasonably assume that, for the Su-\npreme Court of the United States to step in and grant relief \nin this posture, the applicant would have at least presented\na rock-solid argument in support of its underlying merits \nposition.  Thus, here, one would expect the Government to \nvigorously maintain that the Department was legally enti-\ntled to all but eliminate two grant programs that Congress \nestablished a decade ago.  But in this Court, the Govern-\nment offers no defense against the Plaintiff States’ claim \nthat the Department’s erasure of the grants at issue was \narbitrary and capricious. Instead, the Government raises \nseveral threshold and remedial questions about the scope of \nthe District Court’s power to review the Government’s al-\nlegedly unlawful conduct.2  \n  The Government’s request for emergency relief from this \nCourt—without presenting any defense as to the merits of \nthe Plaintiff States’ arbitrary-and-capricious challenge—is\nstriking.  And the Court now blesses this strategic decision \nto sidestep the underlying merits by reinstating grant ter-\nminations that both lower courts have said are likely un-\nlawful.  This seems like a development in our practices re-\nlated  to  emergency  applications  that,  at  a  minimum, \nrequires further exploration.  If the emergency docket has \nnow become a vehicle for certain defendants to obtain this \n—————— \n2To be specific, the Government argues that the lawfulness of the ter-\n \nminations is irrelevant for present purposes because (1) the Court of Fed\neral Claims, not the District  Court, has original jurisdiction over this dis-\npute; (2) the Department’s grant-termination decisions are “committed \nto agency discretion by law” and thus  not reviewable under the APA, 5 \nU.

In an appeals sys-\ntem that is supposed to provide prompt resolution of all  le-\ngal challenges, this new avenue for piecemeal interlocutory\nreview enables strategic delay and facilitates obfuscation of \nthe weaknesses of the defendant’s merits positions. \nA \n  Take this case, for example.

Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, \n196–197 (1947).  Moreover, the agency’s abruptness  leaves \none wondering whether any reasoned decisionmaking  has \noccurred with respect  to  these terminations at all.3   These  \nare precisely the kinds of concerns that the APA’s bar on \narbitrary-and-capricious  agency  decisionmaking  was \nmeant to address. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.

As explained more fully in the accompanying \n16  memorandum, a reasonable person would likely question Judge Martínez-Olguín’s impartiality, and \n17  accordingly, recusal is required under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). In addition, due to Judge Martínez-Olguín’s \n18  experience as a managing attorney at CLSEPA, she likely has personal knowledge of the irreparable harm \n19  that CLSEPA is alleging, which is a disputed fact in this proceeding. Thus, recusal is also required under \n20  28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1). \n21   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  Stay Motion Addendum 311\n\n(336 of 348), Page 336 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 336 of 348\n \n \n \n1  DATED: April 9, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

In this \n5 \n6  involving President Trump’s determinations on the appropriate expenditure of resources related to \n7  various immigration-related priorities. \n8  Although recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455 is normally undertaken by a judge sua sponte, counsel \n9  may bring the issue to a Judge’s attention by formal motion or raise it informally.1 Local Civil Rule 3 –\n10  14 Commentary. Recusal is required in this case for at least three reasons. First, Judge Martínez-Olguín \n11  was previously employed as a managing attorney by the lead Plaintiff in this case, Community Legal \n12  Services in East Palo Alto (CLSEPA), so a reasonable person would likely question her impartiality. 28 \n13  U.S.C. § 455(a). Second, Judge Martínez-Olguín has made various statements critical of President \n14  Trump’s immigration agenda, further underscoring the appearance of partiality in this case. And third, \n15  given Judge Martínez-Olguín’s likely knowledge about CLSEPA’s budget and organization, she \n16  presumably has personal knowledge regarding the irreparable harm that CLSEPA alleges it will suffer \n17  absent federal funding, an issue that is contested in this case. Because she likely has personal knowledge \n18  about a disputed fact, 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1) mandates recusal.  \n19  Defendants therefore respectfully request that Judge Martínez-Olguín recuse herself from \n20  presiding over this case, vacate the injunctive relief entered, and reassign the case to a different judge \n21  whose impartiality would not be questioned.  \n22  STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS \n \n23    From 2017 to 2018, Judge Martínez-Olguín was an attorney at CLSEPA. See Araceli Martínez-\n24  Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, at 2, \n25 \n \n1 Additionally, under California Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(f), a lawyer engages in \n26 \n“professional misconduct” if she “knowingly assist[s], solicit[s], or induce[s] a judge or judicial officer \nin conduct that is a violation of an applicable code of judicial ethics or code of judicial conduct, or other \n27 \nlaw.”  Cal. Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 8.4(f). Because no disclosures about possible conflicts of interest \nwere made at the start of litigation, counsel for Defendants bring these issues to the Court’s attention \n28 \nnow. \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  Stay Motion Addendum 313\n\n(338 of 348), Page 338 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 338 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 5 of 12\n \n \n \n1  https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Martínez-Olguín%20SJQ%20Public%20Final.pdf (last \n2  accessed Apr. 8, 2025). Specifically, in 2017, she was employed as a Senior Immigrants’ Rights \n3  Attorney and, in 2018, she was the “Managing Attorney” of CLSEPA’s Immigrant Rights’ Project. Id. \n4  In 2018, Judge Martínez-Olguín began her career at the National Immigration Law Center, where she \n5  was a staff attorney from 2018 to 2020 and then a Supervising Attorney from 2020 until her nomination \n6  to the federal judiciary. Id. Notably, during her time at National Immigration Law Center, Judge \n7  Martínez-Olguín represented a class of individuals who were eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood \n8  Arrivals (DACA). Id. at 31. One of her co-counsel for that case was Karen C. Tumlin. Id. In February \n9  2023, Judge Martínez-Olguín was confirmed as Judge for the Northern District of California.  \n10    On March 26, 2025, Plaintiff CLSEPA and other similar organizations filed this lawsuit \n11  challenging the government’s decision to withhold funding for direct legal services for unaccompanied \n12  alien children. See ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs are represented by Judge Martinez-Olguin’s former employer, \n13  National Immigration Law Center, and Karen Tumlin, among others. The following day, Plaintiffs \n14  moved for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). ECF No. 7. The Court ordered the government to file \n15  a response to the TRO motion by noon on March 31, 2025. ECF No. 17. The government filed its \n16  opposition accordingly. ECF No. 24. The next day, hours after a hearing on the TRO motion, the Court \n17  granted Plaintiffs’ TRO Motion. ECF No. 33.  \n18  LEGAL STANDARD \n19  Recusal is mandatory where a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. \n20  § 455(a) (explaining that a federal judge “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his \n21  impartiality might reasonably be questioned”). Recusal under this subsection is appropriate where a \n22  “reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge’s impartiality might \n23  reasonably be in question.” Yagman v. Republic Ins., 987 F.2d 622, 626 (9th Cir. 1993). That standard is \n24  an objective one; the “reasonable person” for this inquiry is not “someone who is ‘hypersensitive or \n25  unduly suspicious,’ but rather is a ‘well-informed, thoughtful observer.’” United States v. Holland, 519 \n26  F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Whether a reasonable person would question a judge’s \n27  impartiality is not based on one single factor, but on the “totality of the circumstances.” See Yagman, \n28  987 F.2d at 626 (impartiality might be reasonably questioned considering “all the facts.”); see also Doe \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2  Stay Motion Addendum 314\n\n(339 of 348), Page 339 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 339 of 348\n \n \n \n1  v. Cabrera, 134 F. Supp. 3d 439, 450 (D.D.C. 2015) (looking to the “totality of the circumstances” to \n2  determine whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality). \n3  The touchstone for recusal under Section 455(a) is “not the reality of bias or prejudice but its \n4  appearance.” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 548 (1994). “The very purpose of § 455(a) is to \n5  promote confidence in the judiciary by avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever \n6  possible.” United States v. Patti, 337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \n7  Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 865 (1988)). Thus, “any doubts must be resolved in favor of \n8  recusal.” Id.; see also Parker v. Connors Steel Co., 855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir. 1988) (“It has been \n9  stated on numerous occasions that when a judge harbors any doubts concerning whether his \n10  disqualification is required he should resolve the doubt in favor of disqualification.”). \n11  A judge also “shall” recuse where she has “personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts \n12  concerning the proceeding” or “has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.” 28 U.S.C. \n13  § 455(b)(1). Unlike 455(a), if one of the provisions of section 455(b) applies, then disqualification is \n14  mandatory regardless of whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality. Liljeberg, \n15  486 U.S. at 859 n. 8. Section 455(b) applies a subjective standard for the judge to determine whether he \n16  or she can be truly impartial when trying the case. If the judge believes there is a risk of prejudice, it is \n17  “incumbent on him to recuse himself from the case as failure to do so would amount to an abdication of \n18  duty” and would be “in clear derogation of the solemn promise he made when he took his oath of \n19  office.”  United States v. Holland, 519 F.3d 909, 915 (9th Cir. 2008). \n20  DISCUSSION \n21  There is little doubt that a reasonable person would question Judge Martínez-Olguín’s \n22  impartiality in this case. CLSEPA is the lead Plaintiff in the case, yet Judge Martínez-Olguín served as \n23  CLSEPA’s managing attorney within Plaintiff’s organizations from 2017-2018. In this role, Judge \n24  Martínez-Olguín established and ran the Immigration Rights project where she “identified issues for \n25  local or state policy advocacy and impact litigation, engaged in community education, and provided \n26  advice and counsel to community groups.” Araceli Martínez-Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial \n27  Nominees, at 24, https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Martínez-\n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3  Stay Motion Addendum 315\n\n(340 of 348), Page 340 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 340 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 7 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Olguín was part of CLSEPA’s management team, where she set and implemented policies and practices. \n2  Id. at 48.  \n3  The conflicts created by Judge Martínez-Olguín’s affiliation with the lead Plaintiff is \n4  unavoidable. Judge Martínez-Olguín held senior roles for at least one of the litigating parties; her \n5  connection to the Plaintiffs is too substantial for a reasonable person to ignore or minimize the risk of \n6  impropriety. Further underscoring the close entwinement between CLSEPA and Judge Martínez-Olguín, \n7  upon her elevation to the bench in 2023, CLSEPA posted a public Facebook post celebrating that \n8  “former CLSEPA attorney Araceli Martínez-Olguín ha[d] been confirmed as a U.S. district judge.” \n9  Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Facebook (Mar. 6, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/58nhrsna. \n10  Indeed, at least one media outlet has noted the previous employment relationship between Judge \n11  Martínez-Olguín and CLSEPA and has suggested that her recusal may be necessary. See Chuck Ross, \n12  Federal Judge Orders Trump Admin To Resume Funding Left-Wing Immigration Groups—Including \n13 \n14  administration/federal-judge-orders-trump-admin-to-resume-funding-left-wing-immigration-groups-\n15  including-her-former-employer (“Martínez-Olguín’s work for one of the plaintiffs in the litigation could \n16  lead to calls for her recusal from the case.”). Recusal is thus warranted because the public would \n17  reasonably question her ability to be impartial. The responsibility of the Court is not only to be fair and \n18  impartial but to appear fair and impartial to the public.  \n19  Beyond her affiliation with CLSEPA, Judge Martínez-Olguín has not kept her disdain for \n20  President Trump quiet. Instead, she has voiced her political views both inside and outside the courtroom. \n21  In various past statements made in her capacity as an immigrant-rights advocate, Judge Martínez-Olguín \n22  described President Trump’s immigration policies implicating minor aliens as “unlawful and cruel,” \n23  National Immigration Law Center, Facebook (Nov. 12, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/5c8jjmr3, and she \n24  further rebuked President Trump for his views on various immigration issues, e.g., Trump admin \n25  proposal would hike fees for immigration applications, impose asylum charge, CBS News (Nov. 17, \n26  2019), https://tinyurl.com/cnp7urvt. In other public fora, Judge Martínez-Olguín criticized Trump \n27  “administration efforts to chip away at DACA” and disclaimed the INA’s various jurisdictional \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4  Stay Motion Addendum 316\n\n(341 of 348), Page 341 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 341 of 348\n \n \n \n1  boundaries to judicial review of President Trump’s immigration efforts. ACS Los Angeles 2019-2020 \n2  Supreme Court Review (Aug. 11, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/2kxe8jcc. \n3  Those statements are directly germane to the issues Judge Martínez-Olguín is presiding over and \n4  therefore would give a reasonable person pause as to whether she can be impartial. The instant case \n5  involves the government’s decision to discontinue providing direct legal services to unaccompanied \n6  alien children. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a TRO citing irreparable harm to their organization if the \n7  funding stops. See Decl. of Marth Ruch, Lead Immigration Managing Attorney, CLSEPA, ECF No. 7-\n8  16 ¶ 5 (attesting that “[w]ith [HHS] funding, CLSEPA employs six staff members dedicated to \n9  providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children,” and that representation of \n10  unaccompanied children makes up a significant portion of the six staff members’ case work). And \n11  Defendants raised jurisdictional defects with Plaintiffs’ claims that the court rejected outright. See Def’s \n12  Opp, ECF 24, at 1, 10–12. (Mar. 31, 2025). \n13  In addition to her prior role as managing attorney for a party in this case and her professional \n14  background, Judge Martínez-Olguín also has a relationship with the attorneys representing Plaintiffs in \n15  this case. One of the organizations representing Plaintiffs is the National Immigration Law Center, \n16  where Judge Martínez-Olguín worked as an attorney up until her confirmation as a district-court judge. \n17  In her Senate Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, she noted that “potential conflicts of interest could \n18  be presented in matters being litigated before me by the lawyers from the National Immigration Law \n19  Center. If a conflict were to arise, I would immediately recuse myself from the matter.” Araceli \n20  Martínez-Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, at 50, \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5  Stay Motion Addendum 317\n\n(342 of 348), Page 342 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 342 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 9 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Tumlin represented a class of individuals who qualified for DACA, challenging the first Trump \n2  Administration’s decision to restrict the DACA program. See Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, No. \n3  16CV4756NGGVMS, 2020 WL 7121849, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2020) (explaining the background of \n4  the case). Similarly, Judge Martínez-Olguín represented DACA recipients alongside Ms. Tumlin in \n5  Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 12-cv-2546 (D. Ariz.). While her representation alongside \n6  Plaintiff’s counsel in other cases involving foreign-national children may not be sufficient to create an \n7  appearance of bias by itself, considering the totality of the circumstances—including her previous \n8  employment with Plaintiff CLSEPA and relationship with National Immigration Law Center—a \n9  reasonable person would question Judge Martínez-Olguín's impartiality here. See Yagman, 987 F.2d at \n10  626; see also Doe, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 450 (looking to the “totality of the circumstances” to determine \n11  whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality). \n12  Overall, a reasonable person would question whether a former managing attorney could be \n13  impartial when deciding whether her previous employer and employees, represented by her former co-\n14  counsel, will be irreparably harmed by a President’s policies that the Judge has criticized in the public \n15  square as an advocate. That appearance of impropriety mandates recusal. \n16  Beyond positional conflicts, Judge Martínez-Olguín should recuse because she, as a former \n17  managing attorney at Plaintiff CLSEPA, very likely has personal knowledge of the organization’s \n18  budget and operations and therefore has personal knowledge about CLSEPA’s allegations regarding \n19  irreparable harm—a disputed fact in this case. Judge Martínez-Olguín presumably has personal \n20  knowledge about how CLSEPA obtains funding, its budget considerations, and its financial dependency \n21  upon funding from the federal government. ECF 7-16 at 6. If Judge Martínez-Olguín does, in fact, \n22  possess such knowledge based on her previous experience, her recusal is required by law. 28 U.S.C. \n23  § 455(b)(1). \n24  CONCLUSION \n25 \nDefendants deserve a court proceeding free from concerns about impartiality. To remove the \n26 \npossibility of any impartiality to these proceedings and to maintain the public’s confidence in the judicial \n27 \nsystem, Defendants respectfully request that this Court recuse itself and return this matter to assignment \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6  Stay Motion Addendum 318\n\n(343 of 348), Page 343 of 34 C8ase: 25-2358, 04/14/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 343 of 348\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 10 of 12\n \n \n \n1  before a judge who does not have a personal connection to a party or counsel in this case.

NELSON, BADE, COLLINS, LEE, and BRESS, Circuit Judges, \n \ndissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc:  MOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK \nU.S. COURT OF APPEALS \nWe respectfully dissent from the denial of the government’s request to rehear \nthis case en banc.  The government’s appeal in this high-profile case raises serious \nquestions  about  judicial  overreach,  separation  of  powers,  and  the  misuse  of \ninjunctive relief.  Consideration by the full court was therefore warranted to fix the \nmotions panel’s errors that entrenched the district court’s ruling.  Most concerning, \nthe  panel’s  order  is  contrary  to  the  Supreme  Court’s  recent  ruling  in  an \nindistinguishable case that presented the same issues.   \nThe Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232, directs the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to ensure, \n“to the greatest extent practicable,” that unaccompanied children in immigration \ncustody receive legal representation.  Id. § 1232(c)(5).  Consistent with the TVPRA’s \nrequirement  that  HHS  prioritize  pro  bono  counsel,  HHS’s  Office  of  Refugee \nResettlement  (“ORR”)  issued  the  “Foundational  Rule,”  codified  at  45  C.F.R. \n§ 410.1309(a)(4), formalizing the agency’s discretion to either fund direct legal \nrepresentation or secure pro bono counsel.  The government exercised this discretion \nin March 2025 to terminate funding for direct legal services provided by nonprofit \nsubcontractors under a federal contract with the Acacia Center for Justice. \n1 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 4 of 10\nEleven  nonprofit  legal  organizations  sued,  alleging  that  the  contract \ntermination violated the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), the TVPRA, and \nORR’s regulations.  Following a hearing, the district court granted a temporary \nrestraining order (“TRO”) enjoining the government “from withdrawing the services \nor funds, … particularly ORR’s provision of funds for direct legal representation \nservices to unaccompanied children.”  In doing so, the district court also refused the \ngovernment’s request for an injunction bond under Rule 65(c). \nThe government moved to dissolve the TRO after the intervening Supreme \nCourt decision in a closely analogous case.  See Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. \nCt. 966 (2025) (per curiam).  But instead of dissolving the TRO, the district court \nextended it to the maximum time allowed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. \nThe government immediately sought relief from the Ninth Circuit, arguing \nthat the TRO functioned as a de facto preliminary injunction and was entered without \njurisdiction in light of Department of Education v. California.  After receiving \nadditional briefing from the parties, the motions panel summarily dismissed the \nappeal and denied the government’s emergency motion to stay the TRO as moot in \na one-paragraph order.  The motion panel’s order concluded that the district court’s \ntemporary restraining order was not appealable and did not reach the merits.  The \ngovernment then requested en banc review by the full court.  We should have granted \nit.   \n2 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 5 of 10\nThe Supreme Court has cautioned that a district court cannot “shield its orders \nfrom  appellate  review  merely  by  designating  them  as  [TROs],  rather  than  as \npreliminary injunctions.”  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87 (1974).  Just a few \nweeks  ago  the  Court  reiterated  that  a  TRO  is  appealable  under  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1292(a)(1) when it carries “the hallmarks of a preliminary injunction.”  Dep’t of \nEduc., 145 S. Ct. at 968.  Indeed, this court too has made clear it “treat[s] a TRO as \na preliminary injunction ‘where an adversary hearing has been held, and the court’s \nbasis for issuing the order [is] strongly challenged.’”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. \nTrump, 932 F.3d 742, 762 (9th Cir. 2018) (quotation omitted).   \nThe district court’s TRO in this case has the “practical effect” of a preliminary \ninjunction and it is thus appealable.  Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 594 (2018) \n(citation omitted).  The Supreme Court has recognized that such “practical effects” \ninclude  whether the  challenged TRO  might have  “serious, perhaps  irreparable, \nconsequence[s].”  Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (internal \nquotation marks omitted).  Another relevant consideration is whether the challenged \nTRO can be “‘effectually challenged’ only by immediate appeal.”  Id. (citation \nomitted); see also Sampson, 415 U.S. at 86 n.58 (noting that “the possibility of \ndrastic consequences which cannot later be corrected” is a relevant factor (quoting \nPan Am. World Airways, Inc. v. Flight Eng’rs’ Int’l Ass’n, 306 F.2d 840, 843 (2d Cir. \n1962))); Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968.  \n3 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 6 of 10\nThe TRO here exhibits the “hallmarks” and “practical effect” of a preliminary \ninjunction.  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968; Abbott, 585 U.S. at 594.  To comply \nwith  the  TRO,  the  federal  government  must  disburse  taxpayer  funds,  directly \nimpacting the U.S. Treasury and necessarily interfering with the Executive Branch’s \ndiscretionary administration of ORR funds as allocated by Congress.  This will have \n“serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence[s],” Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, because the \ndisbursed funds will be difficult or impossible to recover.1  Such a “practical effect” \nis characteristic of mandatory preliminary injunctive relief, not a temporary restraint.  \n \nAbbott, 585 U.S. at 594.  And the effect is practically indistinguishable from the \neffects of the TRO that the Supreme Court held earlier this month constituted an \n“appealable preliminary injunction.”  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968 (construing \nas an appealable preliminary injunction an order that “enjoin[ed] the Government \nfrom terminating various education-related grants” and “require[d] the Government \nto pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they \naccrue”).  \n \n1  Underscoring the permanent and irreparable harm to the government from the \ndisbursement of the funds at issue, the district court refused to set a bond under Rule \n65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  Fed R. Civ. P. 65(c) (“The court may \nissue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant \ngives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the costs and \ndamages  sustained  by  any  party  found  to  have  been  wrongfully  enjoined  or \nrestrained.” (emphasis added)). \n4 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 7 of 10\nIn  addition to being  on  all  fours  with the TRO that the  Supreme Court \nconstrued as a preliminary injunction in Department of Education, the TRO here \nalso satisfies the sufficient condition articulated by this court in East Bay.  932 F.3d \nat 762 (“We treat a TRO as a preliminary injunction where an adversary hearing has \nbeen held, and the court’s basis for issuing the order [is] strongly challenged.” \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).  The parties had an opportunity to \nbe heard, and the district court issued the TRO based on briefing.  See id. at 763 \n(citing the appealing party’s opportunity to brief and be heard as an important factor \nsupporting appealability).  And “the [district] court’s basis for issuing the order [is] \nstrongly challenged” because it likely lacked jurisdiction for the same reasons the \nSupreme Court identified earlier this month in Department of Education.  See 145 \nS. Ct. at 968.  \nThe trajectory of that case may sound familiar.  There, a group of States \nbrought an APA challenge to the cancellation of several federal grants.  See id.  A \ndistrict court granted a TRO and effectively required the government to pay out past-\ndue grant obligations.  Id.  The government appealed and moved for a stay pending \nappeal, which was denied, and the government then filed an application with the \nSupreme Court to vacate the TRO.  Id.  The Supreme Court held that the government \nwas likely to succeed in showing that the district court lacked jurisdiction to order \nthe payment of money under the APA.  Id.  The Court explained that “the APA’s \n5 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 8 of 10\nlimited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual \nobligation to pay money’” as the district court had ordered the government to do, \nand that “the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over [such] \nsuits.”  Id. (citation omitted).  The Supreme Court thus stayed the district court’s \nTRO.  \nThat  analysis  should  have  controlled  this  case.    As  in  Department  of \nEducation, Plaintiffs here proceeded under the APA seeking monetary relief, and \nthe district court issued an order “to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money.”  \nId. (quotation omitted).  But the Supreme Court made crystal clear its skepticism \nabout the federal district court’s jurisdiction over claims like this one: claims that \nseek “to order the payment of money under the APA” or “enforce a contractual \nobligation to pay money.”  Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).  “Instead, the \nTucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any \nexpress  or  implied  contract  with  the  United  States.’”    Id.  (quoting  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a)(1)).  Thus, “the Government is likely to succeed in showing the District \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.”  Id. \n(citation omitted).  \nDepartment of Education cannot be distinguished on the ground that the \nPlaintiffs  here  instead  seek  forward-looking  injunctive  relief  to  enforce  the \nprovisions of the TVPRA and Foundational Rule rather than monetary relief for \n6 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 9 of 10\npast-due contractual breaches.  The district court in Department of Education did not \nexpressly  require  the  payment  of  past-due  amounts  and  instead  required  the \nrestoration of the status quo.  See California v. Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-10548-\nMJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  And the Supreme Court \nunderstood the district court’s order to “enjoin[] the Government from terminating \nvarious … grants.”  Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 968.  The district court \nin this case styled its relief in much the same way, “enjoin[ing]” the defendants “from \nwithdrawing the services or funds provided by the [ORR].”  Because Plaintiffs’ \nlawsuit still fundamentally seeks “to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money,” \nit cannot be brought under the APA—just as in Department of Education. \nThat the TRO expires in just a few days, on April 30, 2025, did not provide a \nvalid basis for denying en banc review.  That timing rationale will always exist in \nevery case involving a preliminary injunction masquerading as a TRO—including \nthe Department of Education case where the Supreme Court recently stayed the \ndistrict court’s TRO.  See id. at 970 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (reasoning that the Court \nshould have denied review because “[t]he TRO expires in three days”).  Ultimately, \nthis case merited en banc review for the same reason the Supreme Court acted in \nDepartment of Education.  The limited time period of the TRO does not change the \nreality that the district court here acted without jurisdiction.  And “[a]ny time [the \ngovernment]  is  enjoined  by  a  court  from  effectuating  statutes  enacted  by \n7 \n \n\n Case: 25-2358, 04/25/2025, DktEntry: 22.1, Page 10 of 10\nrepresentatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable injury.”  Maryland v \nKing, 567 U. S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (citation omitted).  \nIf the limited duration of a TRO was always a reason to avoid en banc review, district \ncourts  could  routinely  interfere  with  executive  actions  for  up  to  28  days \nnotwithstanding their complete lack of jurisdiction.  We should have taken this case \nen banc to reinforce that is not acceptable. \n*   *   * \nOur court should have taken this case en banc to fix the motions panel’s errors \nin dismissing this appeal and denying the government’s motion for a stay.  The ink \nis barely dry on the Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education, yet our \ncourt has disregarded it in two respects—ignoring its conclusion controlling our \njurisdiction to hear appeals of certain TROs, as well as its conclusion governing a \ndistrict court’s jurisdiction to interfere with government contracts.  It is unfortunate \nthat we are leaving this to the Supreme Court to (once again) deal with, instead of \nappropriately addressing it ourselves en banc. \n8 \n ",

Every day, in immigration courts across the country, unaccompanied children stand (or \n3 \nsit, with legs dangling over chairs, or are held in caretakers’ arms) in front of federal immigration \n4 \njudges, across from Department of Homeland Security lawyers, in adversarial removal proceedings.  \n5 \nThousands of other unaccompanied children are not in removal proceedings—but nonetheless must \n6 \nnavigate the country’s complex immigration laws as they attempt to complete complicated and lengthy \n7 \napplications allowing them to seek lawful status in the United States.  These children, including babies \n8 \n9  and toddlers, arrived in the United States without a parent or legal guardian.  The vast majority do not \n10  speak English; the babies do not speak at all.  Most do not have the means to hire a lawyer. \n11 \n2.  In one case, a one-year-old named Johan appeared in the Phoenix Immigration Court in \n12 \n2018 with a bottle of milk and a purple ball—but without a parent or legal guardian.  The judge in \n13 \nJohan’s case was “embarrassed to ask” if Johan understood the proceedings.  Turning to Johan’s \n14 \nattorney, the judge addressed the absurdity of the legal theater playing out in his courtroom:  “I don’t \n15 \nknow who you would explain it to, unless you think that a 1-year-old could learn immigration law.”  \n16 \n17  Sasha  Ingber,  1-Year-Old  Shows  Up  In  Immigration  Court,  NPR  (July  8,  2018), \n18 \nhttps://perma.cc/ALU7-RM6V.  Johan’s story is not unusual, and demonstrates that the only way that \n19 \nmany unaccompanied children can navigate the immigration legal system is with the help of a lawyer. \n20 \n3.  Each unaccompanied child has their own individual story, but there are common themes.  \n21 \nWhile many unaccompanied children are from Central America and the “Northern Triangle” countries \n22 \nof Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, unaccompanied children come from all over the world.  \n23 \n24  Most speak Spanish; some only speak indigenous Central American languages.  Few speak much \n25  English.  Many fled their home countries for their personal safety, escaping from gang violence, sexual \n26 \nviolence, political violence, extreme poverty, and other dangers, only to experience further violence \n27 \n28 \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 40\n \n \n1  and even trafficking during their long and dangerous journeys north to the United States.  No matter \n2 \ntheir country of origin or spoken language, all are incredibly vulnerable. \n3 \n4.  Recognizing the needs of these children who are attempting to navigate the complex \n4 \nimmigration  system  on  their  own,  Congress  enacted  laws  to  provide  special  protections  for \n5 \nunaccompanied children in that system.  These include the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \n6 \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), which requires that the government “shall ensure, \n7 \n8  to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent \n9  them in “legal proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n10 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079. \n11 \n5.  More recently, the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“HHS”) Office of \n12 \nRefugee Resettlement (“ORR”) issued a Foundational Rule, published in 2024, meant, in part, to carry \n13 \nout the agency’s obligations under the TVPRA as well as the earlier 1997 settlement in Flores v. Reno \n14 \n(which dictates certain government obligations to unaccompanied children).  Unaccompanied Children \n15 \n16  Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384 (Apr. 30, 2024) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 410 (the \n17 \n“Foundational  Rule”)).    The  Foundational  Rule  requires  the  government  to  “fund  legal  service \n18 \nproviders to provide direct immigration legal representation” to unaccompanied children if there are \n19 \n“available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal orientation, consultation with a lawyer, \n20 \nand ongoing access to lawyers.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a) (2024). \n21 \n6.  Congress has appropriated funds to ensure as many unaccompanied children as possible \n22 \n23  are represented by lawyers.  For fiscal year 2024, for example, Congress appropriated more than $5 \n24  billion  for  Defendants  to  deliver  services  to  unaccompanied  children  under  various  statutory \n25 \nobligations, which includes funding to provide legal representation for unaccompanied children under \n26 \nthe TVPRA “to the greatest extent practicable.”  This appropriation is now available to fund legal \n27 \nrepresentations through September 30, 2027. \n28 \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 6 of 40\n \n \n1  7.  For  more  than  a  decade,  until  March  21,  2025—under  different  presidential \n2 \nadministrations and changing immigration policies—the government fulfilled its obligations under the \n3 \nTVPRA and ongoing congressional appropriations to fund legal representation for unaccompanied \n4 \nchildren.  Through this funding, every unaccompanied child in government custody (at shelters run by \n5 \nORR, under the authority of HHS) had the opportunity to receive a group “know your rights” session \n6 \nand an individual legal screening, and many children received direct legal representation from legal \n7 \n8  service  providers.    These  representations  helped  bridge  the  significant  gap  in  legal  access  for \n9  unaccompanied children, only a small number of whom can afford paid representation or are able to \n10 \nindependently retain a pro bono attorney.  They also helped immigration courts function efficiently and \n11 \navoided forcing immigration judges and government lawyers to engage directly with children in \n12 \nresponding to immigration charges and related questions around relief from removal. \n13 \n8.  Plaintiffs are legal service providers that, until March 21, 2025, provided representation \n14 \nand related services to unaccompanied children with funding from Defendants.  Plaintiffs furthered the \n15 \n16  TVPRA’s goals and the requirements in the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule by providing basic \n17 \nlegal services to unaccompanied children and by representing unaccompanied children in immigration \n18 \ncourt, affirmative immigration proceedings, and related state court proceedings.   \n19 \n9.  Now, Plaintiffs have largely had to stop taking on new clients and face the real threat of \n20 \nnot  being  able  to  continue  their  ongoing  representations.    For  example,  without  funding  from \n21 \nDefendants, Plaintiff Community Legal Service in East Palo Alto has had to stop taking on new \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children clients—even if the children face upcoming court dates without a lawyer—\n24  and if it cannot find other funding sources, its ability to represent existing clients (taken on in reliance \n25 \non continued funding from Defendants) will be in jeopardy.  Plaintiffs’ inability to serve new clients \n26 \nor provide certainty for existing clients is an enormous harm to their mission to serve as many \n27 \nunaccompanied children as possible. \n28 \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 7 of 40\n \n \n1  10.  Plaintiffs’ clients range in age from infants to teenagers, all of whom depend on \n2 \nPlaintiffs for critical legal counsel.  For example, Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center represents \n3 \na 16-year-old girl and her one-year-old son in cases that were funded by Defendants until March 21, \n4 \n2025.  Beginning at the age of six years old, the girl was sex trafficked by her family in Mexico.  After \n5 \ngiving birth to her son, she fled to the U.S. to save him from the same fate. \n6 \n11.  On March 21, 2025, without warning, Defendant the U.S. Department of the Interior \n7 \n8  (“DOI”) sent a notice terminating the contract line items through which Defendants HHS and ORR had \n9  provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied children and ordering Plaintiffs to “immediately stop \n10 \nwork” on their ongoing funded representations (the “Cancellation Order”).  Defendants issued this \n11 \norder despite the TVPRA’s mandate that the government provide unaccompanied children with legal \n12 \ncounsel to the greatest extent practicable and despite the existence of congressionally appropriated \n13 \nfunds to pay for precisely these services through at least September 30, 2027.  As a result, many of the \n14 \napproximately 26,000 unaccompanied children around the country represented by attorneys through \n15 \n16  now-terminated  funding  from  Defendants—including  children  with  immigration  court  hearings \n17 \nscheduled for the following business day—were placed at imminent risk of being cut off from their \n18 \nlawyers.  The children subject to this risk include many children now facing imminent removal from \n19 \nthe United States despite being prima facie eligible for immigration relief. \n20 \n12.  The Cancellation Order flies in the face of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  In \n21 \naddition to interrupting and obstructing attorney-client relationships, contrary to the mandate to provide \n22 \n23  legal counsel to unaccompanied children, it also defeats the broader purpose of both the TVPRA and \n24  the Foundational Rule.  Through the funded representations, Plaintiffs play a key role in identifying \n25 \nand helping child trafficking victims, fulfilling one of Congress’s primary objectives in the TVPRA (to \n26 \n“protect [unaccompanied children] from mistreatment, exploitation and trafficking”).  See TVPRA, \n27 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079 (2008).  By subverting Congress’s funding of \n28 \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 8 of 40\n \n \n1  counsel for unaccompanied children, Defendants ensure more children will remain separated from their \n2 \nfamilies, fewer trafficking victims will be identified and protected, and more children will be at risk of \n3 \nbeing trafficked in the future.   \n4 \n13.  Defendants’ actions will also cause chaos throughout the immigration legal system and \n5 \nare particularly harmful because they come at a time when the government is reinstating expedited \n6 \ndocketing for removal cases for unaccompanied children.  Unaccompanied children across the country \n7 \n8  have immigration court dates this week, at which some will now appear without an attorney.  Other \n9  children have impending deadlines to apply for immigration relief for which they are eligible, but will \n10 \nneed an attorney’s assistance to submit their application.   \n11 \n14.  As a consequence of Defendants ordering Plaintiffs to stop providing direct legal \n12 \nservices, many unaccompanied children will never speak to a lawyer, will never apply for immigration \n13 \nrelief for which they are eligible, will remain in tenuous status for longer, and will not understand what \n14 \nis happening as they are rushed through adversarial removal proceedings.  Immigration judges will be \n15 \n16  left to carry the burden, on their own, to expend limited government resources to educate child \n17 \nrespondents (some only a few months old) on arcane immigration law and apply the law to their cases, \n18 \nwithout a full understanding of the reasons the children left their countries or the realities facing their \n19 \nremoval.  This will cause immigration judges to spend more time on cases for unaccompanied children \n20 \nat a time when the immigration court backlog is already at an all-time high. \n21 \n15.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from ceasing funding for legal representation of \n22 \n23  unaccompanied  children,  an  action  contrary  to  Congress’s  TVPRA  mandate  and  subsequent \n24  congressional funding, contrary to Defendant ORR’s own Foundational Rule on funding for counsel \n25 \nfor unaccompanied children, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n26 \n16.  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, declaring \n27 \nthat Defendants are violating the law and requiring them to continue funding legal representation \n28 \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 9 of 40\n \n \n1  consistent with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin Defendants \n2 \nnationwide from refusing to fund counsel for unaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and \n3 \nthe Foundational Rule. \n4 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5 \n17.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  alleged  in  this  Complaint  under \n6 \n28 U.S.C. § 1331,  as  they  arise  under  federal  law,  including  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act \n7 \n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 702, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n8 \n9  of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and the 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational \n10  Rule (the “Foundational Rule”), 89 Fed. Reg. 34384. \n11 \n18.  The APA waives the U.S. government’s sovereign immunity where, as here, federal \n12 \nagencies have acted in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in \n13 \nviolation of the law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 \n19.  The Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment \n15 \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16 \n17  20.  The Court has authority to grant injunctive relief under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706, and \n18 \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n19 \n21.  Venue  properly  lies  in  the  Northern  District  of  California  under  28  U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C) because Defendants are “officer[s],” “employee[s],” and “agenc[ies],” of the United \n21 \nStates acting in their official capacities, and because Plaintiffs Community Legal Services in East Palo \n22 \nAlto and Social Justice Collaborative are California non-profit organizations headquartered in and \n23 \n24  providing services in the Northern District.  No real property is involved in this action. \n25  22.  Venue is proper in the San Francisco Division because “a substantial part of the events \n26 \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred” in this Division.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).  Plaintiff \n27 \nCommunity Legal Services in East Palo Alto is headquartered in San Mateo County, in this Division, \n28 \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 10 of 40\n \n \n1  Plaintiffs Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto and Social Justice Collaborative both conduct \n2 \nsubstantial business in this Division including by serving unaccompanied children living in the San \n3 \nFrancisco Division and in San Francisco Immigration Court, and Defendants’ conduct has caused harm \n4 \nto these Plaintiffs in this Division by harming their ability to represent and serve unaccompanied \n5 \nchildren in the San Francisco Division. \n6 \nPARTIES \n7 \nA.  Plaintiffs \n8 \n23.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that have received funding from Defendants HHS \n9 \n10  and ORR to provide legal representation and other legal services to unaccompanied children.

Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”) is a nonprofit organization \n24  located in Washington State.  It serves unaccompanied children in Seattle Immigration Court (and \n25 \noccasionally Portland Immigration Court), and has provided free immigration legal services for over \n26 \n40 years.  Through funding from Defendants, NWIRP provided legal services to unaccompanied \n27 \nimmigrant children and youth who have been released from ORR custody throughout Washington \n28 \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 13 of 40\n \n \n1  State.  NWIRP currently represents approximately 500 unaccompanied children in cases formerly \n2 \nfunded by Defendants. \n3 \n33.  Plaintiff Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”) is a nonprofit \n4 \norganization in Colorado.  It serves unaccompanied children in Denver Immigration Court.  Through \n5 \nfunding from Defendants, RMIAN provided legal representation for non-detained unaccompanied \n6 \nchildren and Spanish-language tutoring for staff.  RMIAN is the primary organization providing free \n7 \n8  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  children  in  Colorado.    RMIAN  currently  represents  160 \n9  unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n10 \n34.  Plaintiff Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (“VAAP”) is a non-profit organization in \n11 \nVermont.  It serves unaccompanied children in Chelmsford Immigration Court and Boston Immigration \n12 \nCourt.  Through funding from Defendants, VAAP provided legal representation for detained and non-\n13 \ndetained unaccompanied children, and hosting for two Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  VAAP \n14 \nprovides legal services to about 135 unaccompanied children annually, with 35-40 full scope direct \n15 \n16  representations each year.  Serving unaccompanied children in Vermont is particularly urgent because \n17 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont are often unable to access removal proceedings in far-away \n18 \nBoston and Chelmsford without legal assistance—and VAAP is the only legal services provider for \n19 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont. \n20 \n35.  For  years,  Plaintiffs  heeded  Congress’s  call  to  provide  critical  legal  services  to \n21 \nunaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs collectively represent thousands of unaccompanied children, \n22 \n23  including children in removal proceedings and children applying for affirmative forms of immigration \n24  relief, and their organizational missions and ethical obligations compel them to represent these clients \n25 \nto the best of their abilities.  Defendants’ Cancellation Order severely limits Plaintiffs in performing \n26 \ntheir  respective  missions  to  provide  legal  representation  the  law  requires  be  made  available  to \n27 \nunaccompanied children.  To pay for existing representations, Plaintiffs face the need to use up any \n28 \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 14 of 40\n \n \n1  discretionary or reserve funding, and to lay off employees.  If Plaintiffs are unable to maintain staffing \n2 \nlevels necessary to handle their current caseloads, they will have to assess their ability to meet ongoing \n3 \nethical and court-required obligations to their clients and may be forced to withdraw from ongoing \n4 \ncases.   \n5 \n36.  For many Plaintiffs, these consequences are imminent or already occurring.  For \n6 \nexample, ImmDef has already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff to try to stay financially \n7 \n8  viable and able to serve unaccompanied children for as long as possible.  SJC will have to lay off its \n9  three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows if it cannot find other funding.  To maintain its representations, \n10 \nEstrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 employees in its unaccompanied children program.  VAAP \n11 \nhas had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees and may have to furlough another two \n12 \nemployees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee.  In four weeks, GHIRP will have to lay \n13 \noff most of its 19 employees who provide services to unaccompanied children. \n14 \n15 \nB.  Defendants \n16  37.  Defendant HHS is the department of the federal government that receives appropriations \n17 \nfrom  Congress  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligations  under  the  TVPRA  to  aid  and  provide  legal \n18 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent practicable.  HHS most recently \n19 \nreceived an appropriation for services (including provision of counsel) required under the TVPRA for \n20 \nunaccompanied children on March 23, 2024, in the 2024 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act.  \n21 \nSee Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, div. D, tit. II, 138 Stat. 460, 664–\n22 \n23  65  (2024)  (funding  continued  through  September  30,  2025,  by  the  Full-Year  Continuing \n24 \nAppropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, div. A, tit. I, § 1101(8) (2025)).  This \n25 \nappropriation extends funding for services under the TVPRA through September 30, 2027.  See id. \n26 \n38.  Defendant  ORR  is  the office  of  HHS  (situated  within  HHS’s  Administration  for \n27 \nChildren and Families Division) that oversees services for unaccompanied children under the TVPRA \n28 \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 15 of 40\n \n \n1  and is the agency that passed the Foundational Rule in 2024 through notice-and-comment rulemaking.  \n2 \nDefendant ORR’s Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau is the government body that interacts most \n3 \ndirectly with unaccompanied children. \n4 \n39.  Defendant DOI is the department of the federal government primary contractor listed \n5 \nfor the contract through which Defendants HHS and ORR provided the required funding for counsel \n6 \nfor unaccompanied children.  DOI issued the Cancellation Order on March 21, 2025. \n7 \n8  STATEMENT OF FACTS \n9  A.  HHS And ORR Are Required By Law To Care For Unaccompanied Children. \n10  40.  “Unaccompanied child” is defined by statute as any individual younger than 18 and \n11  without lawful immigration status, who has no parent or legal guardian who is in the United States able \n12 \nto provide care and physical custody.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Once a child is identified as \n13 \nunaccompanied under this definition, they are treated as unaccompanied even if they are later released \n14 \nto  a  sponsor—the  “unaccompanied”  designation  applies  throughout  their  time  navigating  U.S. \n15 \nimmigration law. \n16 \n41.  In the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 100,000 children, toddlers, and babies were identified by \n17 \n18  federal authorities as being unaccompanied children.  These children entered the United States without \n19 \ntheir parents for many reasons, most commonly because they were separated from their parents on their \n20 \nway to the United States, because they were trafficked to the United States, because they were separated \n21 \nfrom their families by immigration authorities after entering the United States, or because they fled \n22 \ntheir home countries without their parents.  A large majority of the children are from Central America \n23 \nand arrived in the United States after a long and dangerous journey north to the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n24 \n25  Many fled unspeakable violence in their home countries and arrived in the United States only to face \n26  detention and deportation on their own.   \n27 \n28 \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 16 of 40\n \n \n1  42.  The United States has long struggled to care for unaccompanied children.  Change has \n2 \ncome as Congress has recognized that unaccompanied children are uniquely vulnerable to trafficking, \n3 \nabuse in government custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system. \n4 \n43.  Until  2002,  the  former  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Services  detained \n5 \nunaccompanied children, treating them similarly to detained noncitizen adults. \n6 \n44.  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 changed this model, giving Defendants HHS and \n7 \n8  ORR legal custody of unaccompanied children, with the mandate to care for these children.  See 6 \n9  U.S.C. § 279(a).   \n10 \n45.  In 2008, the TVPRA imposed further responsibilities on HHS and ORR’s custody of \n11 \nunaccompanied children, including that HHS and ORR “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable \n12 \n. . . that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or \n13 \nmatters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n14 \n15 \nB.  Unaccompanied Children Have Special Legal Rights. \n16  46.  Unaccompanied children have special legal rights, including the right to go through full \n17 \nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge, unlike other individuals who may be put through \n18 \nexpedited removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  If an unaccompanied child applies for \n19 \nasylum, they are entitled to go through the non-adversarial process of an asylum determination through \n20 \nDHS’s Asylum Office—instead of in immigration court, where an immigration judge would preside \n21 \nover an adversarial hearing between a DHS lawyer and the unaccompanied child.  See 8 U.S.C. \n22 \n23  § 1158(b)(3)(C).  Unaccompanied children also have the right to apply for other forms of immigration \n24 \nrelief, like Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, Withholding of Removal, relief under the Convention \n25 \nAgainst Torture, and U or T visas. \n26 \n47.  Although U.S. law guarantees unaccompanied children these rights, the children are not \n27 \nable to avail themselves of these rights unless the children understand their rights, are equipped with \n28 \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 17 of 40\n \n \n1  the tools to exercise them, and are given legal counsel.  For this reason, Congress and ORR have both \n2 \nrecognized the importance of providing unaccompanied children with legal representation—and taken \n3 \nsteps to maximize the number of unaccompanied children represented by attorneys.  The TVPRA \n4 \nrequires Defendants to provide legal representation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent \n5 \npracticable, and Congress has consistently appropriated funds annually to pay for that representation.   \n6 \n48.  And all children (unaccompanied or otherwise) are protected by regulations that prevent \n7 \n8  immigration judges from accepting an admission of removability from respondents under the age of \n9  18—unless the respondent is represented by an attorney or other designated individual.  See 8 C.F.R. \n10 \n1240.10(c). \n11 \n49.  ORR, recognizing its obligations under the TVPRA, committed to providing legal \n12 \nrepresentation to children unable to secure counsel, subject to ORR’s discretion to the extent it \n13 \ndetermines  appropriations  are  available.    ORR  “strives  for  100  percent  legal  representation  of \n14 \nunaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34526 (Apr. 30, 2024). \n15 \n16 \nC.  The TVPRA Requires Defendants to Provide Legal Services to Unaccompanied Children. \n17 \n50.  Congress, through the Homeland Security Act of 2002, commanded Defendants HHS \n18 \nand ORR to “develop[] a plan to be submitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and \n19 \nindependent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests of each such [unaccompanied] \n20 \nchild.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). \n21 \n51.  Acting on this congressional command, ORR contracted with the Vera Institute for \n22 \n23  Justice in 2005 to administer what was then called the “Unaccompanied Children Pro Bono Project” \n24 \n(the “Project”).  The Project was a three-year pilot to develop and test ways to meet the legal needs of \n25 \nunaccompanied children through pro bono legal services.   \n26 \n52.  Through the Project, ORR and Vera collaborated to design a program of subcontracting \n27 \nwith nonprofit legal service organizations to provide basic legal orientation to unaccompanied children, \n28 \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 18 of 40\n \n \n1  to screen their cases to identify those with potential claims for relief from removal, and to recruit and \n2 \ntrain volunteer lawyers to represent children in immigration court.  Initially, the nonprofit legal service \n3 \nproviders were not permitted to use government funding to provide direct representation. \n4 \n53.  At the end of the pilot period in 2008, Vera issued a report to ORR, explaining that \n5 \nvolunteer  attorneys  alone  could  not  represent  all  unaccompanied  children  in  ORR  custody.  \n6 \nAccordingly, the government could not meet its goal of ensuring that a significant percentage of \n7 \n8  unaccompanied children were represented unless it funded attorneys to represent them. \n9  54.  On the heels of this pilot program, Congress imposed additional mandates on ORR and \n10 \nHHS  in  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2008 \n11 \n(“TVPRA”).  The TVPRA mandates HHS to provide counsel for unaccompanied children: \n12 \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n13 \npracticable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the \n14 \ncustody of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not \n15  described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings \nor matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the \n16  greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make every \neffort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to \n17 \nsuch children without charge. \n18 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added). \n19 \n55.  In other words, the TVPRA directs that Defendants “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n20 \npracticable . . .” that unaccompanied children have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings.  If \n21 \nDefendants have funding they can spend to provide counsel for unaccompanied children, they must \n22 \nspend that funding to provide such counsel. \n23 \n24 \nD.  Defendants  Satisfied  Their  Congressional  Mandate  To  Provide  Legal  Services  To \nUnaccompanied Children By Paying Plaintiffs With Funding Appropriated By Congress. \n25 \n56.  Since passing the TVPRA, Congress has specifically appropriated funds for Defendant \n26 \n27  HHS to effectuate section 235 of the TVPRA’s requirement that HHS and ORR provide certain services \n28  to unaccompanied children, including funding legal representations for unaccompanied children “to \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 19 of 40\n \n \n1  the greatest extent practicable.”  See Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009, Pub L. 111-32, tit.

I Sec. 1101(8) (2025)). \n22 \n23  57.  Until 2012, funds for legal representation were used only to match unrepresented \n24  unaccompanied  children  with  available  pro  bono  counsel.    In  2009,  the  House  Appropriations \n25 \nCommittee—following the passage of the TVPRA—explained that “legal representation is absolutely \n26 \ncritical to ensure that children understand their rights as they navigate the legal process to determine \n27 \ntheir status in the United States.”  H. Rep. 111-220, at 165.  The Committee commended the earlier \n28 \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 20 of 40\n \n \n1  pilot program for legal representation for unaccompanied children and included funding “to continue \n2 \nand expand this initiative” “to work towards ensuring that all unaccompanied alien children understand \n3 \ntheir legal rights and have access to pro bono representation.”  Id. at 165-66.  But success of this \n4 \nprogram to match unaccompanied children with volunteer attorneys was highly dependent on local \n5 \ncircumstances, and it was clear pro bono representation alone could not meet the representational needs \n6 \nof unaccompanied children. \n7 \n8  58.  Beginning in 2012, funding became available to pay lawyers dedicated to representing \n9  unaccompanied children, in addition to referring them to pro bono counsel.   \n10 \n59.  Over time, ORR and Congress have directed that funded representation be expanded \n11 \nagain and again.  In reports accompanying appropriations bills, Congress has built on its mandates for \n12 \nfunded legal representation for unaccompanied children over the years.  For example, in 2018 the \n13 \nSenate Appropriations Committee noted “that services provided by qualified and independent legal \n14 \ncounsel to [unaccompanied children] can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of immigration \n15 \n16  proceedings and significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS \n17 \ncustody. The Committee recommendation directs ORR to continue the scope and funding of these legal \n18 \nservices at no less than fiscal year 2017 levels.”  S. Rep. 115-289, at 150.  \n19 \n60.  In  2019,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  directed  funding  specifically  for \n20 \n“qualified and independent legal services for unaccompanied children, including but not limited to \n21 \nknow-your- rights orientations, legal screenings, court preparation and assistance, representation, and \n22 \n23  pro bono referrals” and recommended expanding funded representations.  H. Rep. 116-62 at 145 \n24  (emphasis added).   \n25 \n61.  In 2020, the House Appropriations Committee recommended “no less than $30,000,000 \n26 \nto be spent in fiscal year 2021 for direct representation services to children” and encouraged “ORR \n27 \n28 \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 21 of 40\n \n \n1  to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to minimize the risks of any child having to \n2 \ngo to immigration court without independent legal counsel.”  H. Rep. 116-450 at 180 (emphasis added).   \n3 \n62.  In 2021, the House Appropriations Committee again supported funded representations, \n4 \ninstructing that there should be even more funded representation for unaccompanied children released \n5 \nfrom ORR custody and that such direct representation “shall be made available to children up to the \n6 \nfunded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-96, at 211 (emphasis added). \n7 \n8  63.  In  2022,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  again  supported  “the  continued \n9  expansion  of  independent  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  children”  and  directed  that  funded \n10 \nrepresentations should “be made available to children up to funded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-403, at \n11 \n200 (emphasis added). \n12 \n64.  Until March 21, 2025, the Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”) managed a network of \n13 \n89 legal services organizations (including Plaintiffs) in 159 offices across the country providing \n14 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children through funding from HHS and ORR, under a contract \n15 \n16  between Acacia and DOI (contracting on behalf of HHS and ORR). \n17 \n65.  This contract had four funded line items: \n18 \n1.  Work in ORR shelter facilities, including “know your rights” presentations, intakes to \n19 \nconnect detained children with attorneys, and initial screenings with detained children; \n20 \n2.  Full legal representation for children in and out of ORR custody, as well as other non-\n21 \nrepresentation services such as “friend of court” services in hearings for unaccompanied \n22 \n23  children appearing in immigration court or preparing forms without attorneys; \n24  3.  Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered by \n25 \nthe second line item; \n26 \n4.  Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with unaccompanied \n27 \nchildren. \n28 \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 22 of 40\n \n \n1  66.  As of March 21, 2025, Plaintiffs and other attorneys across the country represented \n2 \napproximately 26,000 children, toddlers, and babies—who arrived in the U.S. without parents or other \n3 \ncaregivers—through funding appropriated by Congress and delivered under this contract. \n4 \nE.  Past  Government  Statements  Acknowledge  The  Benefits  Of  Funding  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children and Babies \n6 \n67.  The importance of legal representation for unaccompanied children is borne out in \n7 \nimmigration court statistics.  Increasing representation for unaccompanied children makes immigration \n8 \ncourts run more efficiently, leads to more unaccompanied children who qualify for immigration relief \n9 \nreceiving that relief, and leads to more unaccompanied children without a case for relief requesting \n10 \n11  voluntary departure instead of unnecessary proceedings. \n12  68.  Unrepresented  children  effectively  never  receive  relief  from  removal.    A  2024 \n13 \nCongressional Research Service report explained that from 2005 to 2017, 90% of unaccompanied \n14 \nchildren in removal proceedings without a lawyer were removed and less than 1% received some form \n15 \nof immigration relief (only 308 children out of nearly 90,000).  See “Unaccompanied Alien Children: \n16 \nAn Overview,” CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (Sept. 5, 2024), https://www.congress.gov/crs-\n17 \nproduct/R43599.  On the other hand, only 21% of represented unaccompanied children received a \n18 \n19  removal order over the same time period, and 73% attain some form of relief, including asylum and \n20 \nother paths to lawful permanent resident status.  Moreover, a greater percentage of unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren with attorneys chose to depart the country voluntarily than those without lawyers, showing the \n22 \nrole attorneys play in helping children understand both their options and—in some circumstances—\n23 \ntheir lack of options. \n24 \n69.  Represented children are also more likely to attend their hearings than unrepresented \n25 \n26  children, and more likely to understand what happens in their cases, easing the burden on immigration \n27  judges to explain proceedings.  From 2005 to 2017, 76% of all unaccompanied children continued to \n28 \nappear as scheduled for their cases—but for represented unaccompanied children, that rate was a near-\n22 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 23 of 40\n \n \n1  perfect 97%.  See Alyssa Snider and Rebecca DiBennardo, “Representation Matters: No Child Should \n2 \nAppear in Immigration Proceedings Alone,” VERA INSTITUTE OF JUSTICE (Dec. 2021), https://vera-\n3 \ninstitute.files.svdcdn.com/production/downloads/publications/representation-matters.pdf. \n4 \n70.  ORR has acknowledged “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to \n5 \nresolve their immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both \n6 \nthe court appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \n7 \n8  Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, 2024) (to be codified at 4 \n9  C.F.R. pt. 410).  \n10 \nF.  Immigration Judges And Other Government Officials Regularly Praise Plaintiffs’ Work, \n11  Which Makes Their Jobs Easier \n12  71.  In the past weeks, immigration judges have expressed their concern that Plaintiffs might \n13 \nno longer be working in their courtrooms and helping courts function smoothly.  Plaintiff Community \n14 \nLegal Services in East Palo Alto prioritizes positive interactions with immigration judges and adopts a \n15 \nproactive approach to advocacy, working with ICE counsel to ensure that their clients can advance \n16 \ntheir cases without missing school—a benefit to everyone involved. \n17 \n72.  A judge in Chicago Immigration Court specifically expressed her concern that NIJC \n18 \n19  might not be available anymore to represent unaccompanied children appearing before her.  Judges \n20 \npraise NIJC’s work as allowing the court to operate efficiently and with confidence that unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren are making informed decisions and have been screened for relief and other needs. \n22 \n73.  Plaintiff the Florence Project was created after a call to action by an immigration judge.  \n23 \nThe Florence Project works with the court and individual judges to coordinate the specialized docket \n24 \nfor unaccompanied children, serving as friend of the court frequently.  Judges show their appreciation \n25 \n26  for the Florence Project’s work by giving its staff space in courtrooms to conduct pre-hearing \n27  orientations for children and even by swearing in Florence Project staff who have just been admitted \n28 \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 24 of 40\n \n \n1  to the Arizona Bar.  In stakeholder meetings with the government, government partners routinely thank \n2 \nthe Florence Project for its work and emphasize the value of the services it provides. \n3 \n74.  Immigration  judges  and  other  stakeholders  rely  on  Amica  Center’s  services.  \n4 \nImmigration judges rely on Amica Center’s friend of court services and ask Amica Center to enter \n5 \nappearances in cases where the judge doubts the child understands their legal options or is competent \n6 \nto appear in court.  ORR shelter staff lean on Amica Center to answer questions about court appearances \n7 \n8  for the children they house. \n9  75.  Immigration judges overseeing dedicated dockets for unaccompanied children in El \n10 \nPaso express gratitude for the work Estrella does both in its representations and its friend of court \n11 \nservices.  Judges appreciate that Estrella helps them reduce their docket loads.  ORR shelter staff \n12 \nappreciate Estrella’s help and training in caring for unaccompanied children. \n13 \n76.  Immigration judges and government attorneys regularly thank RMIAN for its work, and \n14 \nRMIAN and government employees work together to improve immigration court efficiency in Denver.  \n15 \n16  RMIAN saves the court and the government unnecessary time and effort by obtaining dismissal in \n17 \ncases where dismissal is proper and by avoiding unnecessary status hearings.  The Denver Immigration \n18 \nCourt regularly asks RMIAN to provide friend of court services to assist unaccompanied children with \n19 \nanything from a change of address form to a screening for potential human trafficking.   \n20 \n77.  Judges, clerks, and other immigration court staff, and DHS field office staff praise \n21 \nVAAP’s work as making the immigration legal system more fair and efficient.  VAAP’s services help \n22 \n23  immigration courts avoid unnecessary proceedings and help unaccompanied children efficiently appear \n24  in court remotely. \n25 \nG.  In  2024,  ORR  Issued  A  Foundational  Rule  On  Funding  For  Legal  Services  For \n26  Unaccompanied Children \n27  78.  On  April  30,  2024,  ORR  issued  a  final  rule  following  full  notice-and-comment \n28 \nrulemaking:  the “Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule,” which took effect July 1, \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 25 of 40\n \n \n1  2024.  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, \n2 \n2024) (to be codified at 4 C.F.R. pt. 410).  The rule is meant to codify regulations “consistent with \n3 \nORR’s statutory duties” and “responsibilities for coordinating and implement the care and placement \n4 \nof unaccompanied children . . . under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the [TVPRA].”  \n5 \nId., 89 CFR 34384.   \n6 \n79.  Section 410.1309 of the Foundational Rule is titled “Legal Services.”  Id., 89 Fed. Reg. \n7 \n8  34526.  This section of the Foundational Rule affirms ORR’s belief that “legal services providers who \n9  represent unaccompanied children undertake an important function” and stated, “ORR strives for 100 \n10 \npercent legal representation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to \n11 \nthe extent possible.”  Id.   \n12 \n80.  The Foundational Rule requires that unaccompanied children in ORR custody must \n13 \nreceive a legal orientation from “an independent legal service provider” and a “confidential legal \n14 \nconsultation with a qualified attorney.”  Id., 89 CFR 34603.   \n15 \n16  81.  The rule also provides that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund legal \n17 \nservice  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain  unaccompanied \n18 \nchildren.”  Id.   \n19 \n82.  To comply with the TVPRA and INA, the rule recognizes ORR must “ensure that all \n20 \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \n21 \n“ORR may make grants, in its discretion and subject to available resources . . . or contracts under this \n22 \n23  section . . . for the purpose of providing immigration legal representation, assistance and related \n24  services to unaccompanied children.”  Id.   \n25 \nH.  In  2024,  Congress  Reauthorized  Funding  For  The  Services,  And  That  Funding  Is \n26  Available Today  \n27  83.  On  March  23,  2024,  Congress  passed  H.R.  2882,  the  Further  Consolidated \n28 \nAppropriations Act of 2024, which appropriated funding for many federal departments and programs, \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 26 of 40\n \n \n1  including Defendants HHS and ORR.  Congress specifically appropriated funds “for carrying out . . . \n2 \nsection 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008,” \n3 \nthe TVPRA.  Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664.  Section 235 of the TVPRA includes the requirement \n4 \nto provide funding for counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable”—so the \n5 \nappropriation was, in part, meant to pay for this representation.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n6 \n84.  The Senate Report accompanying the 2024 appropriations bill commanded Defendant \n7 \n8  HHS to fund the Services.  The Senate Committee on Appropriations specified there should be \n9  “$5,506,258,000 for the Unaccompanied Children [UC] program.”  S. Rep. 118-84, at 167.  It went on \n10 \nto direct, “The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2023 funding level for \n11 \npost-release services; legal services and access to counsel; and child advocates.  The Committee \n12 \nexpects HHS will continue to expand child-welfare focused post-release services . . . including . . . \n13 \naccess to legal services.”  Id. at 168. \n14 \n85.  The Senate Report expressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund \n15 \n16  counsel for unaccompanied children:  “The Committee also expects these funds will be used to provide \n17 \naccess to counsel, consistent with the goals of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n18 \nof 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration proceedings.”  Id. at 169 \n19 \n(emphasis added). \n20 \n86.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the levels set in the Further \n21 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \n22 \n23  Pub. L. 119-4, div. A tit. I sec. 1101(8) (2025). \n24  87.  This appropriated funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is now available to \n25 \nDefendants through September 30, 2027.  The initial 2024 appropriation extended for two years, \n26 \nthrough September 30, 2026, Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664, and the Full-Year Continuing \n27 \nAppropriations and Extensions Act of 2025 further extended the appropriation by another year, Pub. \n28 \n26 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 27 of 40\n \n \n1  L. 119-4, div. A tit. I sec. 1103 (“Appropriations provided by this division that, in the applicable \n2 \nappropriations Act for fiscal year 2024, carried a multiple-year or no-year period of availability shall \n3 \nretain a comparable period of availability”). \n4 \nI.  Defendants  Abruptly  Shut  Down  And  Later  Resumed  Funding  For  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children Without Explanation \n6 \n88.  Despite  Congress’s  consistent  funding  of  legal  representation  for  unaccompanied \n7 \nchildren, consistent with the TVPRA, Defendants seek to undermine congressional appropriations and \n8 \nthe TVPRA’s mandate.  On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, without warning, Defendant DOI and \n9 \nDefendant  HHS  issued  a  “Stop  Work  Order”  to  Acacia,  ordering  service  providers—including \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs—to “cease all services” and “stop all work” for those services under the contract between \n12  Acacia and DOI.  The order included no end date; it indefinitely suspended the services.  The stop work \n13 \norder gave no explanation, but said it had nothing to do with how the legal services were being run: \n14 \n“The stop work order is being implemented due to causes outside of [Acacia’s] control and should not \n15 \nbe misconstrued as an indication of poor performance by [Acacia].”  Nevertheless, the order explained, \n16 \nthe stop work order could lead Defendants to “terminate the contract.”    \n17 \n89.  Three  days  later,  and  after  significant  backlash,  on  Friday,  February  21,  2025, \n18 \n19  Defendants voluntarily rescinded the stop work order without explanation.   \n20 \nJ.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators Reminded Defendants That Ending Funding For Counsel \n21  For Unaccompanied Children Violates the TVPRA \n22  90.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and DOI \n23  Secretary Doug Burgum to express their “strong opposition” to the now-rescinded stop work order and \n24 \nto note their “concern[] about the chaos and confusion it caused for legal services providers and the \n25 \nchildren they serve.”  Sens. Ossoff, Hirono, et al, Letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and \n26 \nSecretary  Doug  Burgum  (Mar.  3,  2025),  accessible  at  https://www.hirono.senate.gov/ \n27 \nimo/media/doc/250305lettertohhsandinterioronlegalservicesforchildreninimmigrationsystem.pdf.   \n28 \n27 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 28 of 40\n \n \n1  91.  The Senators explained that the stop work order—and any other attempt to stop funding \n2 \ncounsel for unaccompanied children—is a violation of the TVPRA: “Pausing or terminating the \n3 \nprovision of legal services to unaccompanied children under this contract runs directly counter \n4 \nto the requirements of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and \n5 \nplaces 26,000 unaccompanied children at increased risk of trafficking, exploitation, and other harm. \n6 \nThe TVPRA, passed by Congress in 2008 on a bipartisan basis, requires the Department of Health and \n7 \n8  Human Services (HHS) to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that all unaccompanied children \n9  have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, \n10 \nand trafficking. Shirking this statutory mandate heightens the risk of harm for these uniquely vulnerable \n11 \nchildren.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n12 \n92.  The  Senators  went  on  to  explain  that  representation  makes  it  more  likely  that \n13 \nunaccompanied children will appear at their hearings, less likely that the government will lose track of \n14 \nunaccompanied children, and less likely that the unaccompanied children will be trafficked.  Id. at  2. \n15 \n16  93.  The Senators requested a briefing from Defendants about why the stop work order was \n17 \nissued and Defendants’ “plan for compliance with your statutory mandate to ensure that children have \n18 \ncounsel in immigration proceedings.”  Id. \n19 \n94.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any response from Defendants to the Senators. \n20 \n21  K.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants Again Stopped Funding Counsel for Unaccompanied \nChildren \n22 \n95.  Although  Defendants  rescinded  their  February  18,  2025  stop  work  order,  they \n23 \napparently continued to look for ways to avoid the TVPRA’s and Foundational Rule’s requirement that \n24 \nthey fund legal representation for unaccompanied children.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent \n25 \n26  a letter titled “Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” to Acacia (the \n27  “Cancellation Order”).  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for contract \n28 \nline items two through four:  legal representation for unaccompanied children—both in and out of \n28 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 29 of 40\n \n \n1  detention—and other legal services like “friend of court” assistance in pro se matters, Immigrant \n2 \nJustice Corps fellows, and Spanish-language tutoring.  The letter further commanded Acacia and \n3 \nPlaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on these representations. \n4 \n96.  On information and belief, Defendants have no plans to fund any legal representation \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children—whether by reinstating the cancelled contract line items or by finding \n6 \nalternative ways to pay lawyers to represent unaccompanied children.   \n7 \n8  97.  The Cancellation Order took effect at close of business on Friday, March 21, 2025, and \n9  Plaintiffs represent clients with immigration court hearings that were scheduled for Monday March 24, \n10 \n2025—the very next business day.  Yet Plaintiffs received no guidance from Defendants regarding how \n11 \nthose representations should continue—forcing them to choose between seeking to withdraw from their \n12 \nrepresentations or attempting to continue representing their clients unfunded.  Their clients are at risk \n13 \nof losing access to the legal counsel provided by the TVPRA and Foundational Rule.    \n14 \n15 \nL.  Defendants’ Termination Of Funding To Represent Unaccompanied Children Frustrates \nPlaintiffs’  Missions,  Causes  Plaintiffs  Irreparable  Harm,  and  Serves  No  Legitimate \n16 \nPurpose. \n17 \n98.  Terminating funding for attorneys to represent unaccompanied children has devastating \n18 \nand irreparable effects, even more so for the harm it does to unaccompanied children.  Even if \n19 \nDefendants reinstate funding for counsel for unaccompanied children at some unknown future time (an \n20 \nunlikely supposition), the funded representations, the non-profits and attorneys that administer them, \n21 \nand the unaccompanied children that receive vital counsel from them already will have been dealt an \n22 \n23  irreparable blow.   \n24 \n99.  Defendants’  actions  will  cause  Plaintiffs  to  lay  off  employees  and  lose  huge \n25 \npercentages  of  their  overall  funding.    For  Plaintiffs,  the  funding  Congress  has  consistently \n26 \nappropriated to provide services under the TVPRA is existentially important.   \n27 \n28 \n29 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 30 of 40\n \n \n1  100.  For example, funding for the services Defendants have illegally cancelled makes up \n2 \napproximately 55% of ImmDef’s budget and pays for 113 of ImmDef’s approximately 200 employees.  \n3 \nThe cancelled funding made up nearly half of VAAP’s and GHIRP’s operating budgets, 30% of Amica \n4 \nCenter’s budget, over 25% of NIJC’s budget, 15% of RMIAN’s budget, and 10% of NWIRP’s budget.  \n5 \nThe Florence Project received about $12 million a year from the now-cancelled funding, which \n6 \nsupported more than 100 employees. \n7 \n8  101.  Many organizations will have to lay off staff.  SJC will soon have to lay off its three \n9  Immigrant Justice Corps fellows unless it can find another source of funding for their salaries, ImmDef \n10 \nhas already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff, Estrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 \n11 \nemployees in its unaccompanied children program, GHIRP will have to lay off most of its 19 children’s \n12 \nprogram staff in four weeks, and VAAP has had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees, \n13 \nand may have to furlough another two employees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee. \n14 \n15  102.  Because Plaintiffs’ mission is to serve unaccompanied children, they will incur \n16  huge losses to keep doing so.  Plaintiffs’ ethical responsibilities to their clients and commitment to \n17 \ntheir mission of serving as many unaccompanied children as possible mean that Plaintiffs cannot simply \n18 \ncut off services and representations for unaccompanied children.  The organizations will hold on for as \n19 \nlong as they can without funding from Defendants, but the impacts will be harsh whether they are \n20 \nimmediate or sightly delayed. \n21 \n103.  For  example,  CLSEPA  has  had  to  stop  taking  on  new  clients,  even  if  they  are \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children in removal proceedings without an attorney.  CLSEPA is seeking new funding \n24  to continue existing representations of unaccompanied children, but is faced with the risk of having to \n25 \nwithdraw from ongoing representations—which is entirely antithetical to CLSEPA’s mission to serve \n26 \nimmigrants in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. \n27 \n28 \n30 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 31 of 40\n \n \n1  104.  SJC is facing the prospect of having to lay off three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows \n2 \nwho represent unaccompanied children and may be forced to try to find other organizations that can \n3 \ntake on their clients. \n4 \n105.  Estrella faces a budget deficit of more than $200,000 per month to maintain its services \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children without funding from Defendants.  To continue representing the 324 \n6 \nunaccompanied children clients it took on in reliance on funding from Defendants, Estrella will have \n7 \n8  to operate at this significant deficit, threatening Estrella’s other programming.  Once Estrella’s reserves \n9  are depleted, it will likely not be able to offer free legal representation in many circumstances. \n10 \n106.  The  Florence  Project  is  drawing  on  general  funds  to  sustain  its  services  for \n11 \nunaccompanied children but will likely have to conduct significant layoffs of its team of more than 100 \n12 \nemployees who are dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Still, the Florence Project is \n13 \ndetermined to continue its representations of more than 800 unaccompanied children—even without \n14 \nthe funding it relied on when it entered into the representations—though it will cost the organization \n15 \n16  significantly to continue this work. \n17 \n107.  To support their existing Immigrant Children and Youth staff, GHIRP will have to rely \n18 \non  unrestricted  funds  and  savings,  destabilizing  the  organization  as  a  whole.  This  will  divert \n19 \nunrestricted funds away from other services, as these resources typically cover gaps in funding between \n20 \ncontract cycles on other grants, underfunded programs, or new initiatives that are responsive to \n21 \nemerging needs in their community. \n22 \n23  108.  ImmDef has 1,900 cases that were funded by Defendants.  ImmDef estimates its reserve \n24  funding will be exhausted within 6 months, and to hang on that long it will have to dramatically cut its \n25 \nstaffing.  Just to position itself to survive in the short-term, ImmDef has had to lay off 27 staff.  Once \n26 \nImmDef’s  reserves  run  out,  it  will  have  to  terminate  all  113  staff  formerly  funded  by  money \n27 \nappropriated by Congress to provide services under the TVPRA.  As ImmDef has to cut staff, it will \n28 \n31 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 32 of 40\n \n \n1  be unable to reallocate its 1,900 formerly funded cases to other attorneys—so it will be unable to \n2 \ncompetently represent existing unaccompanied child clients. \n3 \n109.  NWIRP will have to spend at least $200,000 per month to sustain its services for \n4 \nunaccompanied children that were previously funded by Defendants. \n5 \n110.  NIJC is transferring employees away from its children’s services to try to make it \n6 \nfeasible to maintain a limited staff to attempt to sustain existing representations. \n7 \n8  111.  RMIAN will have to draw from its financial reserves and the limited funding it receives \n9  that is not pre-allocated for restricted purposes to delay layoffs, and it cannot provide long-term \n10 \nassurances to its clients that they will not be left without lawyers if RMIAN cannot afford to keep its \n11 \nunaccompanied children staff employed. \n12 \n112.  VAAP’s remaining staff of three are stretched as they try to continue to support their \n13 \nclients.  Two of those three may soon need to be furloughed, leaving only one attorney for all of \n14 \nVAAP’s clients. \n15 \n16  113.  Every harm to their clients is a severe harm to Plaintiffs’ mission to help their \n17 \nclients.  Plaintiffs’ clients are significantly harmed by the uncertainty they now face, as Plaintiffs may \n18 \nbe forced to withdraw from ongoing representations.  The cases Plaintiffs took on in reliance on funding \n19 \nfrom Defendants are complex and often take years to resolve, and clients will be harmed if they are no \n20 \nlonger represented by Plaintiffs.   \n21 \n114.  For example, ImmDef took on a client from West Africa with funding from Defendants \n22 \n23  and filed an asylum application with USCIS on his behalf in February 2025.  He is waiting for his \n24  asylum interview to be scheduled, and that interview will be complicated—he speaks a language from \n25 \nthe Niger-Congo language family, so his case requires specialized translation and in-depth presentation \n26 \nof uncommon country conditions.  This client now has no guarantee that ImmDef will have enough \n27 \n28 \n32 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 33 of 40\n \n \n1  attorneys remaining on staff to represent him at his interview when it is scheduled, and ImmDef is \n2 \nhelpless to provide him any assurances. \n3 \n115.  In representations formerly funded by Defendants, SJC represents—for example—three \n4 \nindividuals not in active removal proceedings, with strong cases for affirmative immigration relief that \n5 \nwould allow them to stay in the country.  None of these clients could afford to hire a lawyer, but with \n6 \nfree representation from SJC each has a clear path to relief.  If SJC cannot continue to represent them, \n7 \n8  they will be unlikely to secure the relief they qualify for. \n9  116.  The Amica Center represents a four-year-old boy from Haiti in a case formerly funded \n10 \nby Defendants.  The four-year-old has a hearing in the process of obtaining SIJS relief on April 2, 2025.  \n11 \nHe also has an immigration court hearing in early June.  Without an attorney, the four-year-old could \n12 \nnot engage in these proceedings or obtain any of the immigration relief for which he is eligible.  The \n13 \nAmica Center is continuing to represent him and its other unaccompanied child clients, though \n14 \ncontinuing its now-unfunded representations is very costly to the organization. \n15 \n16  117.  The Florence Project currently represents a set of three siblings who fled their home \n17 \ncountry after their mother died and their sister was murdered.  All three siblings have pending asylum \n18 \napplications and are in the process of obtaining SIJS relief.  Both the asylum and SIJS processes require \n19 \ncomplex legal work, and the siblings would have little hope of obtaining relief without an attorney.  \n20 \nWere the three to lose their Florence Project lawyer—previously funded by Defendants—they would \n21 \nbe severely harmed, a result antithetical to the Florence Project’s mission. \n22 \n23  118.  Defendants’ illegal actions prevent Plaintiffs pursuing their missions.  Because \n24  Plaintiffs’ missions are founded on the belief that no child should face a trained government prosecutor \n25 \nalone,  Plaintiffs  also  suffer  significant  harms  to  their  missions  because  without  funding  from \n26 \nDefendants, they cannot take on new clients.  Every unaccompanied child in ORR custody who needs \n27 \nbut does not receive representation because Defendants have ceased funding legal representation under \n28 \n33 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 34 of 40\n \n \n1  the TVPRA is a harm to Plaintiffs, as organizations that exist to serve these children and to ensure as \n2 \nfew as possible go without a lawyer.  Unrepresented children will be unable to apply for voluntary \n3 \ndeparture to return home, children who have been trafficked will be unable to access the protections \n4 \nafforded to them by U.S. law, and children with strong cases for asylum who fled persecution in their \n5 \nhome countries will be unable to apply for asylum.  These impacts are unacceptable for Plaintiffs. \n6 \n119.  If Plaintiffs are forced to shut down or stop providing services to unaccompanied \n7 \n8  children entirely, these mission harms will be even more acute because entire populations will be left \n9  unserved.  For example, SJC serves remote areas of California’s central valley where there are few \n10 \nother  resources  for  unaccompanied  children,  VAAP  is  the  only  legal  service  provider  for \n11 \nunaccompanied  children  in  Vermont,  RMIAN  is  the  primary  free  legal  service  provider  for \n12 \nunaccompanied children in Colorado, and for the majority of unaccompanied children in ORR custody \n13 \nin Arizona, the Florence Project represents their only access to counsel and only opportunity to receive \n14 \nfree legal representation. \n15 \n16  120.  Defendants’ illegal actions are also causing collateral harm to other parts of \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ missions.  While work serving unaccompanied children is a large portion of what most \n18 \nPlaintiffs do, many Plaintiffs also serve other immigrant populations—but Defendants’ illegal refusal \n19 \nto fund legal representation has knock-on effects that harm all of Plaintiffs’ efforts and other missions. \n20 \n121.  The Florence Project has had to institute a hiring freeze and cannot fill twenty open \n21 \npositions that would be dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Because the Florence Project is \n22 \n23  having to use general funding to maintain its representations of unaccompanied children, it has also \n24  had to freeze hirings in all non-unaccompanied-children service areas across the organization, limiting \n25 \nits ability to carry out other elements of its mission to provide legal services to immigrants. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n34 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 35 of 40\n \n \n1  122.  As GHIRP draws down its savings to continue serving its unaccompanied child clients, \n2 \nthe financial strain threatens its other programming, which also relies on GHIRP maintaining funds to \n3 \ncover gaps in funding for those other programs. \n4 \n123.  For ImmDef, transferring funds from other efforts to try to sustain legal representations \n5 \nof unaccompanied children for as long as possible will mean cutting back on other services it planned \n6 \nto provide for immigrants, including pro se clinics.  ImmDef has also had to stop providing any non-\n7 \n8  essential support for its clients (like paying for medical exams required for certain adjustment of status \n9  applications), though its mission is to support its clients as much as possible.  And ImmDef has had to \n10 \nfreeze all hiring across its organization, hampering its ability to fulfill its overall mission of providing \n11 \nlegal services to immigrants. \n12 \n124.  NWIRP is being forced to draw from its reserves, at the expense of using that money \n13 \nfor the other services it provides immigrants in Washington state. \n14 \n125.  RMIAN will be forced to dedicate its already-limited staff time to fundraise to try to \n15 \n16  cover the gap left by the cancelled funding.  RMIAN is concerned that its staff might take other jobs \n17 \nwith organizations that are more securely funded. \n18 \n126.  Because VAAP is a small organization, its remaining staff of three has struggled to keep \n19 \nup its legal work and field client questions, and has been unable to engage in basic administrative work \n20 \nto keep the organization running. \n21 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n23  Not in Accordance with Law \n24  127.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n25  herein.  \n26 \n128.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) authorizes this Court to set aside agency \n27 \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \n28 \n35 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 36 of 40\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ cancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied \n2 \nchildren violates the TVPRA. \n3 \n129.  The TVPRA requires Defendants HHS and ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent \n4 \npracticable . . . that all unaccompanied . . . children who are or have been in the custody of [Defendants \n5 \nHHS and ORR] . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them \n6 \nfrom mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  This language in the TVPRA \n7 \n8  is and has been understood to require Defendants HHS and ORR to fund attorneys to represent \n9  unaccompanied children.   \n10 \n130.  Congress has consistently and specifically appropriated funds to Defendants HHS and \n11 \nORR to provide services required by the TVPRA, including funding legal representation.  These \n12 \ncongressionally appropriated funds remain available to Defendants to pay for legal representation \n13 \nthrough September 30, 2027.  \n14 \n131.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants terminated the contract line items that funded legal \n15 \n16  representation under the TVPRA.  On information and belief, Defendants are not funding the required \n17 \nlegal representations for unaccompanied children in any other way.  Instead, the Cancellation Order \n18 \nends government-funded legal representation for unaccompanied children despite the availability of \n19 \nappropriated funding for such representations through at least September 30, 2027—two-and-a-half \n20 \nyears from now. \n21 \n132.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n22 \n23  availability of appropriated funds for this purpose, Defendants violate the TVPRA’s mandate to provide \n24  counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable.”  Funds remain available for \n25 \nthis purpose, and Defendants are subverting congressional appropriations and the TVPRA by failing to \n26 \nfund legal representation for unaccompanied children. \n27 \n28 \n36 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 37 of 40\n \n \n1  133.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is \n2 \nnot in accordance with the TVPRA, it is “not in accordance with law” within the meaning of the APA \n3 \nand should be set aside. \n4 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \nAccardi Doctrine \n6 \n134.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n7 \nherein.  \n8 \n9  135.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n10  an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ \n11 \ncancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied children violates the APA under the \n12 \nAccardi Doctrine because it violates ORR’s own policies and regulations. \n13 \n136.  Longstanding Supreme Court caselaw mandates that agencies must adhere to their own \n14 \npolicies and regulations, and that failure to do so violates the APA.  See U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. \n15 \nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds; see also Alcaraz v. \n16 \n17  I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The legal proposition that agencies may be required to \n18 \nabide by certain internal policies is well-established.”).   \n19 \n137.  The  2024  Unaccompanied  Children  Program  Foundational  Rule  requires  the \n20 \ngovernment to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation” to \n21 \nunaccompanied children if there are “available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal \n22 \norientation, consultation with a lawyer, and ongoing access to lawyers.  89 CFR 34604.   \n23 \n24  138.  The ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Policy Guide expressly states that \n25  “ORR funds legal service providers (LSPs) to provide direct immigration legal representation or \n26 \nrepresentation in non-immigration related matters to the extent of available appropriations, and insofar \n27 \nas it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  See “ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children \n28 \n37 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 38 of 40\n \n \n1  Bureau Policy Guide: Section 3.7.2 Direct Legal Representation,” OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT \n2 \n(revised Aug. 1, 2024), https://acf.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-\n3 \nguide-section-3#3.7.2. \n4 \n139.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n5 \navailability of appropriated funds for this purpose through at least September 30, 2027, Defendants \n6 \nviolate the Foundational Rule’s mandate to provide counsel for unaccompanied children to the extent \n7 \n8  there are appropriated funds available to do so and violate ORR’s policy of funding legal service \n9  providers “to the extent of available appropriations.”  Defendants’ violations of ORR’s own rule and \n10 \npolicy violate the APA. \n11 \n140.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children \n12 \nviolates the Foundational Rule and ORR’s own Policy Guide, it violates the APA and should be set \n13 \naside under the Accardi Doctrine as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion [and] otherwise not \n14 \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n15 \n16  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n17 \nArbitrary and Capricious \n18 \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n19 \nherein.  \n20 \n142.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n21 \nan abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n22 \n143.  Defendants  have  given  no  reasoned  justification  for  their  abrupt  cancellation  of \n23 \n24  mandated  and  appropriated  funding  for  legal  representations  for  unaccompanied  children.    The \n25  Cancellation Order gives no reasoning at all.  And the February stop work order expressly disclaimed \n26 \nthat it was issued for any “poor performance” of the legal representations. \n27 \n28 \n38 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 39 of 40\n \n \n1  144.  There is significant evidence that providing legal representation improves efficiency in \n2 \nimmigration court and conserves immigration court time and resources.  Cancelling funding for legal \n3 \nrepresentation will only make immigration courts operate less efficiently. \n4 \n145.  In addition, Defendants’ unlawful cancellation of funding for legal representations \n5 \ndirectly  undermines  Plaintiff  organizations’  missions  to  provide  representation  for  as  many \n6 \nunaccompanied children as possible.  Defendants have “entirely failed to consider an important aspect \n7 \n8  of the problem” by failing to consider the impact to Plaintiffs and their clients.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \n9  Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n10 \n146.  Because Defendants’ termination of the Programs is arbitrary and capricious, Plaintiffs \n11 \nask that the Court set aside Defendants’ actions as violative of the APA. \n12 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n14 \n1.  Declare  that  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  APA  because  they  are  “arbitrary, \n15 \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in violation of the law.” \n16 \n17  2.  Declare  that  Defendants  are  required  to  continue  funding  legal  representation  to \n18 \nunaccompanied children, consistent with the TVPRA and ORR’s Foundational Rule. \n19 \n3.  Set aside Defendants’ actions that violate the APA. \n20 \n4.  Enjoin  Defendants  nationwide  from  ceasing  to  fund  counsel  to  represent \n21 \nunaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule. \n22 \n5.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \n23 \n24  Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and  \n25  6.  Award such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.   \n26 \n27 \n28 \n39 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 40 of 40\n \n \n1  Respectfully submitted,  \n2 \nMarch 26, 2025           \n             \n3 \ns/ Alvaro M.

Absent intervention from legal services providers, \nthey are forced to navigate our country’s complicated immigration processes alone.  Plaintiffs are \na group of legal services providers who provide congressionally mandated legal representation and \nservices to UCs in a variety of immigration proceedings.  Recognizing the importance of this \nrepresentation, Congress has appropriated funding for them since 2012, and continuing through \nSeptember 2027.  Nonetheless, on March 21, 2025, Defendants abruptly cancelled direct legal \nrepresentation  for UCs  under the  contract effectuating  Congress’s mandate.   Without  these \ncongressionally mandated funds, Plaintiffs face the impossible choice of continuing to represent \ntheir UC clients in violation of Defendants’ order and without compensation, or abandoning their \ncore functions. \nRecognizing that children navigating complicated legal proceedings need counsel, in 2008, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them \nin legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(5).    In  keeping  with  that  mandate,  Congress  has  funded  direct  legal \nrepresentation for UCs since 2012.  In 2024, acknowledging its responsibility to provide these \ncongressionally mandated legal  services, ORR issued its Unaccompanied Children Program \nFoundational Rule (“Foundational Rule”) and bound itself to funding legal services providers, so \nlong as congressional appropriations were available.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).   \nOn March 21, 2025, Defendants ordered an immediate stop to the representation work in \nclear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Defendants have provided no \n1 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 34\ninformation as to how or if they will now comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations. \nDefendants have also provided no information to Plaintiffs about how they should deal with their \nongoing commitments to represent UCs (including UCs with immigration court dates as soon as \nthis week).  As a result, Plaintiffs must choose between several intolerable options:  continuing to \nrepresent their clients without compensation, drawing down precious or scarce discretionary or \nreserve funding, cutting other organizational services, laying off or terminating experienced staff, \nor seeking to withdraw from representation, thereby abandoning their child clients in the middle \nof legally complex immigration proceedings they likely cannot navigate alone.  Defendants’ \nactions are contrary to congressional and regulatory mandate and are arbitrary and capricious \nbecause they violate their own regulatory obligations.  To prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, \nto say nothing of irreparable harm to their UC clients, this Court should enjoin Defendants’ attempt \nto terminate direct legal representation for UCs under the APA.  \nThis Court should expedite consideration of this motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a) and \ngrant immediate provisional relief enjoining Defendants’ illegal action, which is creating ongoing \nand irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and their clients.   \nBACKGROUND \nA. Thousands of Unaccompanied Children Rely on Legal Representation Every Year to\nExercise Their Legal Rights\nIn the 2024 fiscal year alone, nearly 100,000 new children were identified by federal \nauthorities as UCs and referred to ORR.  ORR, Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Fact Sheet \n(March 7, 2025), https://acf.gov/orr/fact-sheet/programs/uc/fact-sheet.  These children’s journeys \nto the United States may differ, but all of them are now in the United States without their parents \nor guardians.  William A. Kandel, et al., CRS Report R43628, Unaccompanied Alien Children: \nPotential Factors Contributing to Recent Immigration, at 3, 10 (2014).  Of the UCs who moved \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 34\nthrough ORR custody in 2024, nearly a quarter were 12 years old or younger.  ORR, Fact Sheets \nand Data, supra. \nGiven their inherent vulnerabilities, UCs have special legal rights, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§1232(a)(5)(D), including the right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the\nConvention Against Torture and voluntary departure.  Many UCs also have the right to apply for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), which offers a path to lawful permanent resident status \nbut requires state court proceedings that require counsel.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(j).  UCs may \nalso pursue asylum before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in a non-adversarial process \nwithout  being  subject  to  the  one-year  filing  deadline  applicable  to  adults.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§1158(b)(3)(C).  But these rights are meaningless unless children are educated about their rights\nand equipped with the tools to exercise them, including legal counsel.  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 \n(Apr. 30, 2024).  Unaccompanied children primarily learn about and exercise their rights through \neither full legal representation or limited-scope assistance from a lawyer—often, until March 21, \n2025, an attorney funded by Defendants, and provided by Plaintiffs. \nB. Congress Has Directed HHS to Ensure Unaccompanied Children Have Legal Counsel\nCongress  has  recognized  that  UCs  are  uniquely  vulnerable  to  trafficking,  abuse  in \ngovernment custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system.  Through the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, Congress gave Defendants Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”) and ORR legal custody of UCs, with the mandate to care for the children.  See 6 U.S.C. \n§279(g)(2).  Congress also commanded Defendants HHS and ORR to “develop[] a plan to be\nsubmitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is timely \nappointed to represent the interests of each such [unaccompanied] child.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A).  \nActing on this congressional command, in 2005, ORR developed a three-year pilot program to \nmeet the legal needs of UCs through provision of pro bono legal services.  At the end of the pilot \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 34\nprogram in 2008, a summary report detailed that volunteer attorneys alone were not sufficient to \nmeet  the  representation  needs  of  UCs.    See  Olga  Byrne  &  Elise  Miller,  The  Flow  of \nUnaccompanied  Children  Through  the  Immigration  System,  at  22–23  (March  2012), \nhttps://shorturl.at/KI3Jt.  The report concluded that paid attorneys would be required to cover a \nsignificant  percentage  of  the  representation  that  UCs  needed,  spurring  Congress  to  impose \nadditional representation-related requirements on ORR and HHS through the William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 \n(“TVPRA”).  \nThe TVPRA, which Congress passed in 2008 and has regularly reauthorized since then \n(most recently in 2023), mandates that HHS must provide counsel for UCs: “The Secretary of \nHealth  and  Human  Services  shall  ensure,  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  . . .  that  all \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary \nof Homeland Security . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters.”  8 \nU.S.C. §1232(c)(5) (emphasis added).  Defendants have violated this mandate. \nC. ORR’s Own 2024 Regulations Require Funding for Legal Services for Unaccompanied\nChildren Consistent with Available Appropriations.\nORR has recognized “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \nChildren Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, 2024).  On April 30, \n2024, ORR issued the final “Foundational Rule,” which codified in part HHS’s 1997 Flores \nsettlement.1  Id.  Section 410.1309 of the final rule, titled “Legal Services,” affirms ORR’s position \n1 The Flores settlement, entered into by the federal government and four noncitizen children in \n1997, sets forth requirements regarding the care of UCs while in ORR custody.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34386. \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 34\nthat “legal services providers who represent unaccompanied children undertake an important \nfunction” and  explains  ORR’s goal  of “100 percent  legal  representation of unaccompanied \nchildren.”  Id. at 34526.   \nThe Foundational Rule requires that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund \nlegal  service  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children.”2  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  To comply with the TVPRA and the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  the  rule  recognizes  ORR  must  “ensure  that  all \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \nthat “[t]o the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not \npracticable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide \ndirect immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s \ndiscretion and available appropriations.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), (d).   \nFunds are, in fact, available, through at least September 30, 2027.  On March 23, 2024, \nCongress  passed  H.R.  2882,  the  Further  Consolidated  Appropriations  Act  of  2024,  which \nspecifically appropriated funds through September 30, 2027, “for carrying out” section 235 of the \nTVPRA.  Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664 (2024).  The Senate Appropriations Committee Report \nconfirms there should be “$5,506,258,000 for the Unaccompanied Children program.”  S. Rep. \n118-84, at 169.  The Committee also directed that its “recommendation includes no less than the\nfiscal year 2023 funding level for post-release services; legal services and access to counsel; and \nchild advocates” and that it “expects HHS will continue to expand child-welfare focused post-\n2 Congress has also required ORR to compile and provide lists of legal services providers \n“qualified  to  provide  guardian  and  attorney  representation  services”  for  UCs.    6  U.S.C. \n§279(b)(1)(I).  The Foundational Rule also binds ORR to working with qualified legal services\nproviders to provide orientations and consultations for UCs.  (a)(2)(i)(A).\n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 34\nrelease services . . . including . . . access to legal services.”  Id. at 168.  Finally, the Senate Report \nexpressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund counsel for UCs:  “The \nCommittee also expects these funds will be used to provide access to counsel, consistent with the \ngoals of the [TVPRA] of 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration \nproceedings.”  Id. at 169.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the same levels for \nUC legal representation.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. \nL.119-4, div. A, tit. I, § 1101(8) (2025)).  From December 2023 until March 21, 2025, Defendants\nsatisfied this obligation through contracting with Acacia Center for Justice, who contracted with \norganizations like Plaintiffs to provide direct legal representation for unaccompanied children. \nD. Defendants Terminate Funding for Direct Legal Representation for Unaccompanied\nChildren.\nDespite Congress’s consistent funding of legal representation for UCs as mandated by the \nTVPRA, Defendants’ actions undermine congressional appropriations, the TVPRA’s mandate, \nand ORR’s Foundational Rule.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent a letter titled “Notice of \nPartial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” (the “Cancellation Order”) to the Acacia \nCenter for Justice, the prime contractor on this contract, who then notified Plaintiffs of the \ntermination.  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for direct legal \nrepresentation for UCs—both in and out of ORR’s custody—as of close of business that day, \nignoring the requirement to fund these programs under the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  \nThe letter further commanded the Plaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on any of the active \nrepresentations of UCs and to stop taking on new engagements.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; VAAP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Up until the March 21 letter, Defendants enabled legal services providers, including \nPlaintiffs, consistently to provide direct and ongoing representations to tens of thousands of UCs \nin proceedings, including removal and SIJS proceedings.  The letter provided no explanation for \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 34\nthe termination nor guidance on how to handle existing representations, including those with \nimminent court hearings.  Defendants were silent as to whether providers could continue existing \nrepresentations (unfunded), despite the stop-work direction, or must withdraw immediately and (if \ngranted) be forced to leave their clients in the lurch.  See NWIRP Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11; VAAP Decl. ¶¶ \n12, 13, 21; Estrella Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 19.  \nThis is not the first time that Defendants have acted to halt the legal representation of \nunaccompanied children.  About a month earlier, on February 18, 2025, Defendant Department of \nthe Interior (“DOI”) and Defendant HHS issued an “Immediate Stop Work Order,” ordering legal \nservices providers—including Plaintiffs—to indefinitely “cease all services” and “stop all work” \nfor active legal services.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; MIRC Decl. ¶ 21; Public Counsel \nDecl. ¶ 10; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11.  Although Defendants rescinded the stop work \norder three days later, Defendants’ drastic actions spurred 32 Senators to sign a letter expressing \n“strong opposition” to the stop work order and noting its violation of the TVPRA.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11; see Senator Mazie K. Hirono, \nLetter to HHS and Interior on Legal Services for Children in Immigration System (March 3, 2025), \nhttps://shorturl.at/RcUr3. \nDespite this strong opposition and TVPRA’s mandate, Defendants terminated funding on \nMarch 21, 2025, and have further provided no information about whether or how they intend to \nreplace these critical legal services for UCs.  Terminating funding for these legal services has \ndevastating and irreparable effects on Plaintiffs, which are all the more devastating for the harm \nthey will do to UCs.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 7.  For example, VAAP previously furloughed two of its \nthree direct legal service practitioners on staff after the February stop work order, leaving the \nremaining practitioner to bear two additional full caseloads at a time.  VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 15, 19.  Even \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 17 of 34\nif Defendants reinstate funding for counsel for UCs at some unknown future time, the providers’ \nfunded children’s legal programs and the UCs that depend on their vital counsel will have already \nbeen dealt a fatal blow via mass layoffs of staff for the nonprofits and private providers, see, e.g., \nVAAP Decl. ¶¶ 15, 19, and prolonged government custody or deportations for the children—\nincluding children who could have raised valid claims to lawful immigration status.  \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nMotions for temporary restraining orders are governed by the same standards as motions \nfor preliminary injunctions.  See Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc., 240 \nF.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining the analysis for a TRO and preliminary injunction\nare “substantially identical”).  A temporary restraining order is warranted where the plaintiffs \nestablish:  (1) their likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) the balance of \nequities tips in their favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  All. for the Wild \nRockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)); see also Stuhlbarg, 240 F.3d at 839 n.7 (applying preliminary injunction \nstandard to a temporary restraining order).  Where the government is the defendant, the last two \nfactors merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nARGUMENT \nI. Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits\nAgency action cannot stand if it is contrary to law.  Because Defendants’ termination of\ndirect  legal  representation services is  contrary to  the TVPRA and ORR’s own  regulations, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 34\nA. The Cancellation Order Determines Plaintiffs’ Legal Rights and Obligations and is\nFinal Agency Action Reviewable Under the APA.\nThe APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public \nand their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 \n(1992).  Persons or organizations, like Plaintiffs here, who are “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, [are] entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “[A]gency action” includes not \nonly agencies’ affirmative acts, but also their omissions and failures to act.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). \nUnder the APA, this Court may set aside and enjoin unlawful agency action, and compel \nagency action unlawfully withheld, if it is a (1) “final agency action,” (2) “for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court,” so long as (3) there are no “statutes [that] preclude judicial \nreview” and “agency action is [not] committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), \n704. Plaintiffs satisfy each of these criteria here, and APA relief is therefore proper.\nFinal Agency Action.  Under the APA, “agency action” is defined as “the whole or a part\nof an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to \nact.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13); 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(2).  An agency action is final where two conditions \nare satisfied: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess,” and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n(quotation marks and citations omitted). \nDefendants’ refusal to fund or otherwise provide direct legal representation for UCs is a \nfinal agency action.  See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (attempt to “pause” funding and disbursements constituted final agency \naction).  Immigrant Defenders Law Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, No. 2:21-\n9 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 34\ncv-00395, Dkt. 304 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 14, 2025), is instructive.  In that case, plaintiffs alleged that\nthe Department of Homeland Security unlawfully denied the rights guaranteed by the TVPRA \nfrom unaccompanied children who had previously been processed under the Department of \nHomeland Security’s Migrant Protection Protocols Policy (“MPP”), despite having entered and \nbeen designated as UCs.  Id. at *21–22.  The court held that plaintiffs met the first requirement \nbecause “nothing in the record indicates that the Policy is tentative or that decisionmaking is \nongoing.”  Id. at *18. As to the second, the court found the policy at issue was final because it was \n“an agency action ‘from which legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. at *19 (quoting Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 178). \nHere, Defendants clearly ceased funding direct legal representation to UCs in violation of \nan express statutory mandate and their own regulatory frameworks.  The Cancellation Order \ndirected Plaintiffs to stop all work providing direct legal representation to UCs, including existing \nclients whom Plaintiffs undertook to represent before the Cancellation Order.  This notification is \nfinal:  it terminates all funding for and orders a halt to all direct legal representation, leaving only \nfunding for certain Know Your Rights (“KYR”) presentations and confidential legal consultations.  \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 13; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 11.  That order went \ninto effect immediately on March 21, 2025. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs are forced to choose between continuing to provide unfunded legal \nrepresentation  in  the  face  of  extremely  limited  resources;  cutting  other  vital  organizational \nprograms, laying off, furloughing, or terminating staff; or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing \nrepresentation duties for court hearings, client meetings, and other important preparations for legal \nproceedings as soon as this week.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21.  The longer Plaintiffs go without this funding \nor clarity regarding how to handle their current clients, the fewer services they can provide as they \n10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 20 of 34\nare forced to withdraw from ongoing representations, cut other core programs, and/or lay off or \nreassign staff.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 20–22; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 14.  Institutional knowledge will be \npermanently lost if significant numbers of experienced staff are laid off, irreparably damaging the \nPlaintiffs’ capabilities, regardless of whether funding is ever reinstated.  Thus, this termination \nundeniably has an immediate effect on parties’ rights or obligations.  \nNo Other Adequate Remedy.  Plaintiffs do not have any other adequate remedy for their \nclaims.  The Supreme Court narrowly interprets the “other adequate remedy” limitation, stressing \nthat it “should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of \njudicial review of agency action.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988); see also \nChang v. United States, 327 F.3d 911, 923 (9th Cir. 2003) (“generous” APA review provisions \nmust be given “hospitable” interpretation (citing Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140, 141 \n(1967))).  Instead, “Congress intended by that provision simply to avoid duplicating previously \nestablished special statutory procedures for review of agency actions.”  Darby v. Cisneros, 509 \nU.S. 137, 146 (1993).  Here, no such special procedures have been established.   \nNo Statutory Bar to Review.  Finally, no statute bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims here, and \nCongress has done nothing to override “the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial \nreview”  of  the  administrative  actions  Plaintiffs  challenge.    Bowen  v.  Mich.  Acad.  of  Fam. \nPhysicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986). \nB. Termination of the Legal Representation Programs Violates the TVPRA.\nUnder the TVPRA, Congress requires that the government “shall ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and \nto  “protect  them from  mistreatment,  exploitation,  and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  \nCanceling funding for and ordering stoppage of direct legal representation services to UCs violates \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 21 of 34\nan express congressional mandate.  The Cancellation Order should be held unlawful and set aside.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(2)(A).  \nThe TVPRA, requiring Defendants to “ensure [UC legal representation] to the greatest \nextent  practicable,”  precludes  them  from  terminating  the  legal  representation  program  and \nnullifying its congressionally appropriated funding under circumstances here.  See, e.g., Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 655075, at *18 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (government agencies violated the \nAPA when they withheld appropriated funds when agencies were “required, ‘to the extent of \navailable  appropriations,’  to  ensure  provision  of  support  services  for  resettled  refugees”).  \nDefendants terminated this funding and ordered Plaintiffs to cease UC client representation \nwithout providing any other avenues of legal services for UCs—failing to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that UCs have legal counsel in their immigration proceedings.  Defendants’ \nCancellation Order effectively ends meaningful legal representation for UCs by Plaintiffs and \nforecloses other providers from providing similar legal representation.  VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 20–21. \nAlthough the TVPRA grants Defendants some discretion in how to allocate appropriated \nfunds for legal access, Defendants cannot simply cease funding for direct legal representation in \nits entirety.  See Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18.  That is precisely what happened here: \nDefendants cut off funding for direct legal representation services without providing any guidance \nor explanation to Plaintiffs regarding how they should deal with their ongoing representations and \nwithout any alternative plan for implementing their duties under the statute.  Amica Decl. Ex. 3. \nUltimately, canceling the programs defies express congressional mandates in both the \nTVPRA and appropriations bills.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n118-47, § 4, 130 Stat. 460, 461 (incorporating the explanatory statement published at  170\nCongressional Record H1501-01, which in turn incorporates Senate Report No. 118-84).  Out of \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 34\nthe $5,506,258,000 the Senate Report specified for the UCP, the Report recommended “no less \nthan the fiscal year 2023 funding level for post-release services; legal services and access to \ncounsel; and child advocates,” and that such “funds will be used to provide access to counsel, \nconsistent with the goals of the [TVPRA].”  S. Rep. 118-84 at 167–70 (2023) (emphases added).   \nAfter mandating in the TVPRA that Defendants provide legal representation to UCs “to \nthe greatest extent practicable,” Congress facilitated the provision of legal representation by \nappropriating billions of dollars to the UCP program, which includes (among other services) direct \nlegal representation to UCs.  By consistently appropriating funds for this program for more than a \ndecade, Congress not only ensured that it would be practicable to provide legal representation to \nUCs, but also expressly intended to ensure this outcome.  Given that appropriations are available \nto fund access to direct legal representation, Defendants cannot, consistent with their TVPRA \nobligations, simply refuse to fund such representation.   \nC. Terminating the Legal Representation Programs Violates the ORR Foundational Rule.\nThe government also is “bound by the regulations it imposes upon itself.”  See United \nStates v. 1996 Freightliner Fld Tractor VIN1FUYDXYB-TP822291, 634 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. \n2011).  “Where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their \nown procedures.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974).  Under the Accardi doctrine, parties \nmay bring claims under the APA asserting that an agency has failed to follow its own rules and \ninternal policies.  See, e.g., Alcaraz v. I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  Accardi \nconcerned the failure by the Board of Immigration Appeals to exercise its independent discretion \nin deciding an appeal as required by the agency’s own regulations.  See United States ex rel. \nAccardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266–67 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds.    \nTo establish an Accardi claim, Plaintiffs must show (1) that the government has violated \nits own regulations; and (2) that Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced by that violation.  See Al \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 34\nOtro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024) (plaintiffs \nsufficiently alleged a policy violation based on a rule preamble and alleged substantial hardship \nbased on border turnback policy); see also Carnation Co. v. Sec’y of Lab., 641 F.2d 801, 804 n.4 \n(9th Cir. 1981) (the standard for an Accardi violation is “whether violation of the regulation \nprejudiced the party involved”).  Here, Defendants’ actions violate their express commitment in \nthe Foundational Rule, a binding regulation, to fund legal services providers to provide UC legal \nrepresentation as long as appropriations are available.  Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced \nbecause they rely on that funding to provide critical legal services to UCs and will, in some cases, \nbe forced to stop providing that representation to their UC clients.  Plaintiffs will have to choose \nbetween financial survival and adhering to binding ethical obligations as to existing clients if \nDefendants’ actions are not enjoined.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 14; Estrella Decl. ¶ 15; see also infra \nSection II.A.  \nORR has “recognize[d] that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34529; see also Al Otro Lado, 2024 WL 4370577, at *9 (preambles may sufficiently bind agencies \nunder Accardi).  Accordingly, ORR just last year stated its intention to provide “universal legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children by FY 2027.”  HHS: Administration for Children & \nFamilies,  Justification  of  Estimates  for  Appropriations  Committees,  at  78  (2024), \nhttps://shorturl.at/4VDSL; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 34526 (“ORR strives for 100 percent legal \nrepresentation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to the extent \npossible.”).  Thus, in 2024, ORR adopted the Foundational Rule, which states in relevant part: \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is \nnot practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service \n14 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 34\nproviders  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations. \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  ORR explicitly noted that “in some cases it is \nimpracticable for ORR to secure pro bono legal services for unaccompanied children,” and \nprovided that ORR would fund legal services with available congressional appropriations for those \ncases.  89 Fed. Reg. at 34529.  The Foundational Rule thus explicitly obligates ORR to fund legal \nservices providers to provide direct immigration legal representation, so long as congressional \nappropriations are available and pro bono counsel is not practicable.  See id. at 34529 (“ORR has \ndetermined that its approach to providing legal services to unaccompanied children by enabling \nthem to access pro bono counsel ‘to the greatest extent practicable’ and funding legal services for \nadditional  unaccompanied  children,  as  resources  allow,  is  consistent  with  ORR’s  statutory \nobligations.”).  \nDefendants’ actions on March 21, 2025, subvert these ORR commitments and regulations, \nviolate the Accardi doctrine, and are both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 411 F. Supp. 3d 1036, 1068–69 (C.D. Cal. \n2019).  Congressional appropriations are readily available until September 2027 to fund these legal \nservices, including funds appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025.  See, e.g., Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) \n(2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. \n460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  Nonetheless, without explanation and without a plan \nto replace these critical legal services, the Cancellation Order violates Defendants’ obligations and \nhas caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs substantial hardship, as described below.  See also \ninfra Section II.A.  Because Defendants’ actions violate their own stated policies and substantially \nprejudice Plaintiffs, the termination order should be enjoined.   \n15 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 25 of 34\nII. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements for Injunctive Relief\nA. Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm\nA temporary restraining order is appropriate where, as here, the moving party shows that \nit faces irreparable harm—harm which is (1) “immediate”, Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. \nBaldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988), and (2) “for which there is no adequate legal remedy.”  \nAriz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nOrganizations have standing when a defendant’s actions interfere with their “core business \nactivities.”  FDA. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 395 (2024); see also Valle del Sol \nInc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013) (organizational standing analysis applies to \nirreparable  harm  factor).    When  a  defendant’s  actions  “have  perceptibly  impaired”  an \norganizational plaintiff’s programs, “there can be no question that the organization has suffered \ninjury in fact.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 765 (9th Cir. 2018) (quoting \nHavens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 (1982) (quotation marks removed)).  An \norganization also meets this burden by establishing defendant’s actions have “frustrated [the \norganization’s] mission.”  Id. at 766.     \nHere, immediate injunctive relief is necessary to protect Plaintiffs from suffering severe \nand irreparable harm.  Defendants’ abrupt termination of funding for direct legal representation \ndirectly interferes with Plaintiffs’ missions, immediately impeding their ability to provide critical \nlegal representation that is at the heart of Plaintiffs’ core activities.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 22; VAAP \nDecl.  ¶¶ 21–22;  NWIRP  ¶¶  13–15.    There  is  no  question  that  ceasing  funding  for  legal \nrepresentation services for UCs and terminating the existing services will cause imminent harm \nthat cannot be later remediated.  MIRC Decl. ¶ 32–33; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 37.  The Cancellation Order \nprevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of unaccompanied children with the direct legal \nrepresentation  required  under the TVPRA and the Foundational  Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ \n16 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 26 of 34\nprimary mission of representing these children as contemplated by Congress and the TVPRA.  See, \ne.g., ImmDef Decl. ¶ 2.  If this occurs, “‘there can be no do over and no redress.’”  League of\nWomen Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting League of Women Voters \nof N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014)).   \nPlaintiffs have relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding for these \ncritical resources will continue to be available.  Amica Decl. ¶ 11; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 18.  Cutting \noff this vital resource threatens immediate and irreparable harm.  See, e.g., CLSEPA Decl. ¶ 13; \nVAAP Decl. ¶¶ 22–24; KIND Decl. ¶¶ 16–19.  For example, Immigrant Defenders Law Center \nhas already had to provide 27 staff with layoff notices in response to the Cancellation Order and \nanticipates additional cuts would be necessary if funding is not restored; these staff losses threaten \nits ability to continue representing the 1900 UCs it currently represents.  ImmDef Decl. ¶¶ 20–22. \nIn Texas, Estrella del Paso currently manages 324 pending cases and predicts the loss of funding \nwill require staff layoffs and increase caseloads for existing staff.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6.  The \nGalveston-Houston Immigration Representation Project expects to lay off most of their Immigrant \nChildren and Youth staff within four weeks.  GHIRP Decl. ¶ 21.  Sustaining these services without \nthis funding will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Private providers predict devastating financial consequences, including the potential for \nbankruptcy.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 19; MM Decl. ¶ 18.  And these losses do not even account for the \norganizational knowledge at risk of being lost.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 38; Amica Decl. \n¶ 25; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 21.     \nThese  harms  cannot  be  remediated  or  redressed,  even  if  Defendants  later  provide \nalternative routes for providing direct legal representation for UCs.  The harm to Plaintiffs and \ntheir clients is imminent and irreparable.  The termination of services took effect immediately upon \n17 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 27 of 34\nreceipt of Defendants’ letter on March 21, 2025, which provided no guidance as to what Plaintiffs \nshould do with their existing obligations, including immigration court hearings scheduled for this \nweek.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 15; Amica Decl. ¶ 20; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs have ethical obligations \nto their clients and cannot simply immediately withdraw from representation; indeed, most \nattorneys will require court permission to withdraw.  FIRRP ¶ 34.  Plaintiffs and their clients are \nalready experiencing irreparable harm far exceeding the mere loss of funding, including because \nthey have to furlough or layoff staff and increase the caseloads of staff who can stay on.  After \nlimited reserves run out, Immdef will be forced “to take drastic action to terminate staff across all \npositions  funded  under  this  contract.”  Immdef  Decl.  ¶  21.    Similarly,  KIND  “anticipate[s] \nsignificant layoffs, starting within days” after the termination of funding.  KIND ¶ 16.  Children’s \nimmigration cases “are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly skilled attorneys \nto competently handle them.”  Id. at ¶ 23. Impacted attorneys and staff have years of individualized \nexperience and wisdom with clients, making rehiring after layoffs impracticable.   \nThe imminent potential harms to children are immediate and severe.  For example, “if a \nchild at one of the ORR-subcontracted facilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal \nneed such as an outstanding removal order, Amica Center—the only legal provider with access to \nthe ORR-subcontracted facility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to \nprotect the child from imminent removal.”  Amica Decl. ¶ 21.  Further, “[a]t this very moment, \nthere are children in ORR custody who need our representation who are not receiving it.  This \nmeans that children who want voluntary departure will have their return home unacceptably \ndelayed, victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections they deserve, and children \nfleeing persecution will not be able to have their day in court.”  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 25.  The Court \n18 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 28 of 34\ncannot later reset the clock.  Absent a temporary restraining order Plaintiffs will suffer harm that \ncannot later be fixed.  \nB. The Balance of Equities\nFinally, in considering whether to grant a temporary restraining order, the Court should \n“balance the competing claims of injury and . . . consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 \n(9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)).  Where an \ninjunction will not “substantially injure the other [interested] parties,” the balance of equities tips \nin plaintiffs’ favor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \nHere, there will be no harm to Defendants if this Court issues a temporary restraining order: \nthe Government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Instead, “there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”  State v. Azar, 385 F. Supp. \n3d 960, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds and remanded sub nom. California ex rel. \nBecerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Newby, 838 F.3d at 12) (cleaned up). \nTerminating funding for direct legal representation for UCs, without any plan to ensure \nthat current representations are not interrupted, violates Congress’s express directive in the \nTVRPA and ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.  Enjoining Defendants from \neffectively terminating these services merely prevents Defendants from defying these mandates \nand shirking their own voluntarily undertaken obligations.  Paying out funds already appropriated \nfor these services cannot harm Defendants in any meaningful way compared to the harms that \nPlaintiffs and their clients will suffer if this Court does not issue a temporary restraining order.   \n19 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 29 of 34\nMaintaining funding for these direct legal representation services furthers critical public \ninterests: ensuring children have access to legal representation and protection from trafficking, as \nwell as promoting efficiency and fairness within the immigration system for thousands of children \nwho have viable claims for immigration relief in the United States.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 34529 \n(recognizing benefit of UC representation to the immigration system generally).  Plaintiffs’ work \nwith UCs is widely recognized and commended by the legal community writ large, including by \nImmigration Judges, clerks, and the Department of Homeland Security’s field office staff.  VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 11; MIRC Decl. ¶ 19; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 13. The programs promote judicial economy by \npreventing immigration courts from bearing expenses such as unnecessary status conferences, \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 11, terminating proceedings for children where jurisdiction is improper, VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 9; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 10, and efficiently funneling contact with the courts through a single \npoint of contact rather than having 50 or more representatives reaching out individually, MIRC \nDecl. ¶ 19.  Plaintiffs play a key role in ensuring that children’s needs are being met while in ORR \ncustody.  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, Plaintiffs make referrals to Child Advocates, advocate \ndirectly with ORR to avoid unnecessary “step ups” for children at risk of being placed in more \nrestrictive detention settings, and request Trafficking Victim designations from the Office of \nTrafficking in Persons.  Id.  Because Plaintiffs are independent, non-governmental organizations, \nchildren often share concerns with Plaintiffs they do not feel comfortable sharing with ORR-\nsubcontracted staff or other stakeholders.  Id.  A temporary restraining order enjoining the \nCancellation Order is in the public interest.   \nIf the Court does not issue a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs and the thousands of \nUCs they represent will face clear, immediate, and irreparable harms.  Defendants themselves, \nmeanwhile, do not face any injury from the issuance of a temporary restraining order to stop their \n20 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 30 of 34\nillegal action.  Given these considerations, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of \nissuing a temporary restraining order here. \nIII. A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate\nWhile injunctive relief must be tailored to the scope of the case, “there is no bar against . . . \nnationwide relief in federal district or circuit court when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal v. Brock, 843 \nF.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 1987).  Moreover, “an injunction is not necessarily made over-broad by\nextending benefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is \nnot a class action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they \nare entitled.”  Id. at 1170–71.  Accordingly, “when a reviewing court determines that agency \nregulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their application \nto the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640,681 \n(9th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  The appropriate injunctive relief “often depend[s] as much on the \nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l. Refugee \nAssistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579–80 (2017).   \nHere, because “the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff,” a nationwide injunction is necessary \nto provide Plaintiffs complete relief.  See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); Doe #1 \nv. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1069 (9th Cir. 2020) (nationwide scope of injunction proper to provide\ncomplete relief).  Defendants’ decision to terminate direct legal representation directly violates the \nTVPRA and the Foundational Rule as to every legal services provider and will cause irreparable \nharm if allowed to proceed.  A nationwide injunction is the only way to effectively grant Plaintiffs \nthe relief they seek: the preservation of their mission to provide critical legal services for UCs \nacross the country who would otherwise be left to navigate the immigration system alone.  It is \nalso the only way to ensure that Defendants comply with the congressional mandate and their own \n21 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 31 of 34\nregulatory obligations to provide legal representation to UCs to the greatest extent practicable \nWithout a nationwide injunction, Defendants may continue to deny funding to other nonprofit \norganizations providing similar services, preventing thousands of UCs from  receiving legal \nrepresentation and assistance, and forcing Plaintiffs to make an impossible choice between serving \ntheir mission unfunded or turning their backs on vulnerable clients.  Plaintiffs, whose primary \nmission and core organizational activities include critical direct legal representation for these \nchildren, will be forced to either deplete their reserves by continuing to provide as much direct \nlegal representation services as possible or turn their backs on vulnerable clients.  Notably, \nDefendants—who, consistent with congressional appropriations, already allocated funding for \ndirect legal representation—will not face any harm from a nationwide injunction requiring them \nto continue funding legal representation as planned.  Thus, the balance of equities weighs heavily \nin favor of a nationwide injunction. \nCourts have recognized that “a fragmented immigration policy would run afoul of the \nconstitutional and statutory requirement for uniform immigration law and policy.”  Washington v. \nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2017).  “For these reasons, in immigration cases, [this \nCourt] consistently recognize[s] the authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a \nuniversal basis.” E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681 (quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nMoreover,  plaintiffs  are  located  throughout  the  country,  and  “[d]ifferent  interpretations  of \nexecutive policy across circuit or state lines will needlessly complicate agency and individual \naction,” see E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681, and piecemeal injunctive relief for the more than \n80 providers nationwide would be impractical and difficult to administer.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, \n985 F.3d 309, 326–27 (4th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, a nationwide injunction is appropriate in this \ncase.  \n22 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 32 of 34\nIV. Plaintiffs Seek Expeditious Resolution of their Claims\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a), courts “shall expedite the consideration of any action . . . if \ngood cause therefor is shown.”  Actions for preliminary or temporary injunctive relief “are named \nthe highest priority civil actions,” and “special consideration” should be given to “actions asserting \nfederal rights.”  Freedom Commc’ns Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 157 F.R.D. 485, 486 (C.D. Cal. 1994). \nFurther, “[l]itigants who can persuasively assert that there is a special public or private interest in \nexpeditious treatment of their case will be able to use the general expedition provision.”  H. Rep. \nNo. 985, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5708, 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. \n5782.  \nCourts have found that “good cause” is shown where the effective relief hinges on \nappropriate timing.  See, e.g., Pacesetter, Inc. v. Aortech Intl. PLC, 2012 WL 12894007, at *1 \n(C.D. Cal. Nov. 1, 2012) (expediting when a regularly scheduled motion would exceed the time \nallotted in defendant’s Rectification Notice); see also 9th Cir. Rule 27-12 (allowing for expedited \nbriefing and hearing “upon showing of good cause”).  Actions also may be expedited where one \nparty’s income stream is dependent on the outcome of the case.  See, e.g., AIG Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nLaw Offs. of Theodore Coates, P.C., 2008 WL 4543422, at *3 (D. Colo. Oct. 10, 2008). \nHere, funding for the direct legal representation that Plaintiffs provide to UCs has already \nabruptly been rescinded.  Plaintiffs have been ordered to stop work and no longer receive funding, \neffective March 21, 2025.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; VAAP Decl. ¶ 13.  Not only will Plaintiffs be \nirreparably injured, see supra Section II.A, but the thousands of children whom Plaintiffs and other \nservice providers assist will also be harmed if these services are not restored.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21; \nNWIRP Decl. ¶¶ 14–15; Estrella Decl. ¶ 16; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 21.  With every passing day that \nfunding is blocked for these services, more children will appear in court proceedings across the \ncountry without any guidance or assistance to help them navigate these complex proceedings even \n23 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 33 of 34\nas provider organizations stretch their resources to fulfill their missions.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 7; VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 9.  In addition to the harm to these children’s due process rights, the loss of representation \nwill cause dysfunction and confusion in the immigration system, including the immigration courts. \nVAAP Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 10; MIRC Decl. ¶ 19.  Accordingly, there is sufficient \n“good cause” to expedite the consideration of this motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a). \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants’ actions violate the APA.  Because  this conduct will immediately cause \nPlaintiffs irreparable harm, this Court should grant immediate provisional and nationwide relief \nenjoining Defendants’ illegal actions and preserving the status quo pending a final judgment. \n24 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 34 of 34\nRespectfully submitted, \nMarch 27, 2025 \n/s/  Alvaro M.

On March 21, 2025, despite the existence of congressionally appropriated funds \nfor this purpose, Defendants abruptly terminated long-standing funding for direct representation \nfor unaccompanied children.  On April 1, 2025, the Court issued a temporary restraining order to \nprotect Plaintiffs until the Court rules on this motion, enjoining Defendants from “withdrawing the \nservices or funds” Defendants provided under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule as of March 20, \n2025, and precluding Defendants from “cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding \nfor its duration.”  Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction preserving the status quo and \nextending the Court’s temporary restraining order through the resolution of this case. \nThe motion is based upon this notice of motion; the memorandum of points and authorities \nin support thereof that follows; the declarations of  Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, Daniela Hernández \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \ni \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 36\n     \n \nChong Cuy, Jill Martin Diaz,  Ana Raquel Devereaux, Marion Donovan Kaloust, Miguel Angel \nMexicano  Furmanska,  Vanessa  Gutierrez,  Ashley  T.

Absent intervention from legal services providers, they must \nnavigate our country’s complicated immigration processes alone.  Plaintiffs are a group of legal \nservices providers dedicated to providing legal support to these children.  In furtherance of their \nmissions, Plaintiffs provide congressionally mandated direct representation and services to UCs. \nIn 2008, recognizing that children navigating complicated legal proceedings need counsel, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) by statute to “ensure, to \nthe greatest extent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to \nrepresent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, \nand trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (the “TVPRA”).  Under this mandate, Congress has funded \ndirect representation for UCs since 2012.  In 2024, confirming its responsibility to provide these \ncongressionally  mandated legal services, ORR issued its Unaccompanied Children Program \nFoundational Rule (“Foundational Rule”) and bound itself to funding legal services providers, so \nlong as congressional appropriations are available.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  Congress has \nappropriated funding through September 30, 2027. \nDespite these congressional and regulatory mandates, on March 21, 2025, Defendants \nabruptly cut funding for the legal representation and other legal services work, including friend of \ncourt services assisting UCs in immigration court and efforts to refer UCs whom Plaintiffs could \nnot represent to pro bono attorneys, in clear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”).  For brevity, Plaintiffs use “direct representation” throughout to refer to the legal services \ncancelled by Defendants.  Defendants provided Plaintiffs no information about how Plaintiffs \nshould address their ongoing commitments to represent UCs (including UCs with immigration \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n1 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 12 of 36\n     \n \ncourt dates in the coming days) or about how Defendants intended to comply with their obligations \nto provide direct representation to UCs to the greatest extent practicable.   \nPlaintiffs’ missions are to ensure immigrants in the United States—particularly UCs—have \nlegal support and do not face the immigration system alone.  To that end, Plaintiffs collectively \nrepresent thousands of UCs through funding from Defendants mandated by the TVPRA and \nFoundational Rule.  By refusing to fund direct representation for UCs, in violation of these \nmandates, Defendants put Plaintiffs in an impossible position: Plaintiffs’ missions and ethical \nduties compel them to continue legal representation of UC clients.  Although doing so without \nfederal funding may ultimately bankrupt Plaintiffs, to do otherwise would betray their core \nmissions and ethical obligations to their clients.  The Court can (and should) redress this harm by \nissuing an injunction ordering Defendants to meet TVPRA and regulatory requirements to fund \ndirect representation, as the Court temporarily did with its current TRO.   \nDefendants’ actions contravene congressional and regulatory mandate and are arbitrary and \ncapricious.  They also violate this Court’s temporary restraining order.  To prevent irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs, to say nothing of irreparable harm to their UC clients, this Court should issue a \npreliminary injunction, enjoining Defendants through the resolution of this case from cutting off \nfunding for direct representation required under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs refer the Court to their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order for a full \nfactual background.  See Dkt. 7 at 11-17.  On those facts, the Court issued a temporary restraining \norder  on  April  1,  2025  (the  “Order”),  commanding  Defendants  to  fund  required  direct \nrepresentation for UCs through April 16, 2025.  See Dkt. 33 at 1-2.  Although Defendants stated \nthey “are in receipt of the Court’s order and are taking steps to comply expeditiously,” Amica \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n2 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 13 of 36\n     \n \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 13, as of this filing, Plaintiffs are not aware of any actual steps Defendants have \ntaken to comply.  Id. ¶ 15.  Plaintiffs intend to move to enforce compliance with the Order.    \nFurther, on April 2, 2025, Defendants said they would not produce the administrative \nrecord until the latest time permitted by the Local Rules: with Defendants’ answer.  Id. ¶ 14. \nFinally, Plaintiffs wish to clarify the state of the contract between Defendants and Acacia, \nwhich Defendants partially cancelled on March 21, 2025, given Defendants’ incorrect indication \nat the April 1, 2025, hearing that there was no contract in place at all.  The Cancellation Order \ncancelled three of the four contract “line items,” leaving only the first line item (“know your rights” \npresentations and legal consultations).  See Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 3.  The contract was due to expire March \n29, 2025, but Defendants issued a six-month extension for the first line item.  See Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 11. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA preliminary injunction is warranted when plaintiffs establish: (1) likelihood of success \non the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) the balance of equities favors them; and (4) an injunction \nis in the public interest.  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(citing Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  When the government is the \ndefendant, the last two factors merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The Ninth \nCircuit uses the “serious questions” test, which allows the court to evaluate the Winter test on “a \n‘sliding scale’ . . .  under which a party is entitled to a preliminary injunction if it demonstrates \n(1) ‘serious questions going to the merits,’ (2) ‘a likelihood of irreparable injury,’ (3) ‘a balance \nof hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff,’ and (4) ‘the injunction is in the public \ninterest.’” Flathead-Lolo-Bitterroot Citizen Task Force v. Montana, 98 F.4th 1180, 1190 (9th Cir. \n2024) (citing All. for the Wild Rockies v. Pena, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017)).  This \n“standard is ‘a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits.’”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n3 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 14 of 36\n     \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nAgency action cannot stand if it is contrary to law or if it is arbitrary and capricious.  \nBecause Defendants’ termination of direct representation services is contrary to the TVPRA and \nORR’s  own  regulations  and  is  also  arbitrary  and  capricious,  Plaintiffs  have,  at  minimum, \ndemonstrated serious questions going to the merits and are likely to succeed on the merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Bring Their Claims and Their Claims are Redressable. \nThe Court has found Plaintiffs fall within the “zone of interests” of the TVPRA and have \narticulated harms that can be redressed by this Court.  Defendants’ assertions otherwise remain \nmeritless, and the Court can and should reject them again. \nPrudential standing:  As the Court already found, Plaintiffs have prudential standing \nbecause their APA claims are in the zone of interests protected by the TVPRA.  See Dkt. 33 at 3-\n4.  While Defendants insist the injury Plaintiffs plead is entirely financial, Plaintiffs face harms to \ntheir core activities and organizational missions, including their commitment to ensuring UCs are \nnot left to navigate the immigration system alone.  See e.g., Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 2; ImmDef \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 2; FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  These interests are at least “‘marginally related to’ \nand ‘arguably within’ the scope of” the TVPRA, E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d \n640, 668 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224–-25 (2012)), as well as Congress’s interest in “ensuring, to the greatest \nextent practicable” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and \nto “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \nRedressability:  Plaintiffs’ core business activities and organizational missions—which \ninclude ensuring UCs have legal representation—have been critically and irreparably harmed by \nDefendant’s actions.  The requested injunctive relief will redress these harms.  While Defendants \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n4 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 15 of 36\n     \n \nhave  latitude  to  determine  the  mechanism  by  which  they  comply  with  the  TVPRA  and \nFoundational Rule—whether via reviving the terminated portions of the contract or  another \nmethod of funding direct representation, either approach significantly increases the likelihood \nPlaintiffs will obtain relief from their harms. See Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 476-77 (1987). \nThe showing required for the redressability prong of Article III standing is modest.  See \nRenee v. Duncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012).  It is sufficient for Plaintiffs to demonstrate \na “significant increase in the likelihood” that they will obtain relief redressing their injury as a \n“practical consequence” of an order from the court.  Id.  The reinstatement of required funding for \ndirect representation to UCs significantly increases the likelihood that Plaintiffs will obtain relief, \neither through funding to continue their own representations or an alternative plan providing legal \nrepresentation  to  UCs  consistent  with  congressional  appropriations,  the  TVPRA,  and  the \nFoundational Rule. The requested injunctive relief is extremely likely to ensure that Plaintiffs’ \nclients maintain representation—as Plaintiffs’ missions demand—without forcing Plaintiffs to \ndivert resources from other mission critical initiatives.  \nThe TVPRA’s directive requires “ensuring, to the greatest extent practicable” that all UCs \nreceive  legal  “counsel  to  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings”  and  to  “protect  them  from \nmistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Direct redress of Plaintiffs’ \nharms is a practical consequence of enjoining “Defendants nationwide from ceasing to fund \ncounsel to represent unaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational \nRule.”  Dkt. 1 at 39.  This is true regardless of how Defendants fashion the injunctive relief. \nB.  This Court has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims. \nThis Court rejected Defendants’ argument that the Tucker Act deprives the Court of \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  Dkt. 33 at 3 (citing Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 893530, at *4–\n7 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025)).  The Court is correct, and Plaintiffs address this issue only briefly. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n5 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 16 of 36\n     \n \nThe law is clear: the Tucker Act only deprives the Court of jurisdiction of claims that are \nboth (1) founded upon contract-based rights and (2) seek a contract-based remedy.  See United \nAeronautical Corp. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1025-26 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nNeither of those conditions are met here.  The Tucker Act “yields when the obligation-\ncreating statute provides its own detailed remedies, or when the [APA] provides an avenue for \nrelief.”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. U.S., 590 U.S. 296, 323–24 (2020); see also Pacito v. Trump, \n2025 WL 655075, at *17 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (rejecting argument Tucker Act bars APA \nreview).    Plaintiffs’  claims  stem  from  the  TVPRA,  the  Foundational  Rule,  and  the  APA: \nDefendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs violates their obligations under those \nauthorities and, in turn, violates the APA and is a breach of the Accardi doctrine, and arbitrary and \ncapricious.  See Dkt. 7 at 20-24.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims do not rely on or arise from any contract.   \nBecause Plaintiffs seek “declaratory and injunctive relief” under their statutory rights to \nprevent Defendants unlawfully refusing to provide any funding for counsel for UCs instead of \n“money in compensation for . . . losses,” the Tucker Act does not apply.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, \n487 U.S. 879, 893, 895; see also Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, \n1111 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (declaratory and injunctive relief are not “specific to actions that sound in \ncontract”); Pacito, 2025 WL 655075 at *17 (“[B]ecause Plaintiffs seek specific remedies, not \ndamages,” Tucker Act did not apply).  As “Claims Court[s do] not have the general equitable \npowers of a district court to grant prospective relief,” a district court is the proper venue for \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905–07.  That Defendants previously fulfilled their \nstatutory and regulatory obligations by contracting does not change this analysis—were that the \ncase, no plaintiff could challenge Defendants’ illegal actions.  See, e.g., Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n6 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 17 of 36\n     \n \n(rejecting the “broad notion that any case requiring some reference to or incorporation of a \ncontract” cannot be heard in district courts) (cleaned up). \nC.  The Cancellation Order Determines Plaintiffs’ Legal Rights and Obligations and is \nFinal Agency Action Reviewable Under the APA. \nThe APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public \nand their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 \n(1992).  Persons or organizations, like Plaintiffs here, who are “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, [are] entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “[A]gency action” includes not \nonly agencies’ affirmative acts, but also their omissions and failures to act.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  \nUnder the APA, this Court may set aside and enjoin unlawful agency action, and compel \nagency action unlawfully withheld, if it is a (1) “final agency action” “for which there is no other \nadequate remedy in a court,” so long as (2) there are no “statutes [that] preclude judicial review” \nand “agency action is [not] committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), 704.  \nPlaintiffs satisfy each of these criteria here, and APA relief is therefore proper.  \nFinal Agency Action.  An agency action is final for APA review where two conditions are \nsatisfied: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” \nand (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  Defendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs is a final \nagency action.  See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 3, 2025) (attempt to “pause” funding and disbursements is final agency action); Imm. Defs. \nLaw Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 2:21-cv-00395, Dkt. 304, at *18–19 (C.D. Cal. Mar. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n7 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 18 of 36\n     \n \n14, 2025) (in TVPRA context, final agency action found because policy was not tentative, \ndecision-making was not ongoing, and legal consequences would flow from action). \nHere, Defendants clearly ceased funding direct representation for UCs in violation of an \nexpress statutory mandate and their own regulatory frameworks.  The Cancellation Order directed \nPlaintiffs to stop all work providing direct representation to UCs, including pre-existing clients.  \nThis notification is final.  VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶ 13; NWIRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-10) ¶ 10; RMIAN \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 11. \nSince the Cancellation Order and its ensuing consequences, the choices facing Plaintiffs \nhave grown even more dire.  Defendants’ actions and failure to comply with the Court’s Order  \ncontinue to force Plaintiffs to choose between providing unfunded direct representation with \nextremely limited resources; cutting other vital organizational programs, laying off, furloughing, \nor terminating staff; and/or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing representation duties for court \nhearings, client meetings, and other important preparations for legal proceedings.  See e.g., Dkt. 7 \nat 10-11; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 9; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶ 21.  The \nlonger Plaintiffs go without funding or clarity regarding how to handle their current clients, the \nfewer services they can provide as they are forced to withdraw from ongoing representations, cut \nother core programs, and/or lay off or reassign staff. Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-\n7) ¶ 20–22; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 7; NWIRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-10) ¶ 14.  Thus, the termination has \nan immediate effect on parties’ rights or obligations.  \nNo Bar to Review: Defendants’ actions do not fall within the limited exceptions to judicial \nreview under the APA.  The longstanding presumption of judicial review for agency actions under \nthe APA “may be rebutted only if the relevant statute precludes review, 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), or if \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n8 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 19 of 36\n     \n \nthe action is ‘committed to agency discretion by law,’ § 701(a)(2).”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. \nFish & Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018).  Neither exception applies here. \nFirst, the “well-settled” presumption of judicial review for agency actions can be overcome \nonly by “clear and convincing evidence” of congressional intent to preclude judicial review.  See, \ne.g., Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 252-53 (2010).  No statute bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims \nhere.  Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986). \nSecond, Defendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs does not fall into the \n“very narrow” exception for actions committed to agency discretion.  Arizona Power Pooling \nAss’n. v. Morton, 527 F.2d 721, 727 (9th Cir. 1975).  This exception is “restrict[ed] to those rare \ncircumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful \nstandard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Weyerhaeuser Co., 586 U.S. \nat 23 (emphasis added) (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993)).  The Ninth Circuit \napplies this exception only when “there is truly no law to apply.”  Jajati v. U.S. Customs & Border \nProt., 102 F.4th 1011, 1014 (9th Cir. 2024) (quotation marks omitted). \nThe TVPRA, agency regulations, and Defendants’ own policies and announcements, \nprovide “meaningful standards under which courts can review whether [Defendants’] wielded its \ndiscretion in a permissible manner.”  Jajati, 102 F.4th at 1014.  As the Court noted in its Order, \nDefendants’ actions “potentially violate[] Congress’s express directive in the TVPRA and ORR’s \nown commitments in the Foundational Rule,” both “meaningful standards” under which the Court \ncan review Defendants’ actions.  Dkt. 33 at 5.  Both the TVPRA and ORR regulations include \nlanguage  describing  Defendants’  obligations  to  fund  direct  representations.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(5) (Defendants “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all UCs receive \nlegal  “counsel  to  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings”)  (emphasis  added);  45  C.F.R. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n9 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 20 of 36\n     \n \n§ 410.1309(a)(4) (ORR “shall fund legal service providers . . . subject to ORR’s discretion and \navailable appropriations”).  This language offers a clear standard to judge Defendants’ actions.  \nSee e.g., Arizona Power Pooling Ass’n, 527 F.2d at 727 (holding that statutory language instructing \nthat the agency “shall” devise the “most feasible plan” for obtaining electronic power made it \n“clear that . . . the [agency did] not have unfettered discretion” and the exception for actions \ncommitted to agency discretion did not apply).   \nDefendants’ cancellation of all funding is not the type of “lump-sum appropriation” or \nother judgment that is presumptively committed to agency discretion.  Weyerhaeuser Co., 586 \nU.S. at 23.  In their Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for TRO, Defendants rely heavily on Lincoln \nv. Vigil to argue that funding for direct representation for UCs is wholly committed to agency \ndiscretion.  See Dkt. 24 at 18; Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993).  There, the Court emphasized \nthe relevant “appropriations Acts . . . do not mention the [cancelled] Program,” the relevant statutes \n“speak about Indian health only in general terms,” and “Congress never expressly appropriated \nfunds” for the cancelled program.  Id. at 186, 193–94.  In contrast, here, the relevant statutes point \nto Defendants’ obligations to ensure direct representation to the “greatest extent practicable” and \nCongress has expressly appropriated funds for services required under the TVPRA, including \nprovision of counsel.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \nPub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, \nPub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664–665 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.   \nThat Defendants have some discretion in how to allocate funds for direct representation \ndoes not render their actions unreviewable under the APA.  Even “grants [of] broad discretion to \nan agency” do “not render the agency's decisions completely nonreviewable . . .  unless the \nstatutory scheme, taken together with other relevant materials, provides absolutely no guidance as \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n10 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 21 of 36\n     \n \nto how that discretion is to be exercised.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(emphasis added).  Here, both the statutory and regulatory schemes clearly provide such guidance. \nD.  Termination of the Direct Representation Programs Violates the TVPRA.  \nUnder the TVPRA, Congress mandated the government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \npracticable,” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and to \n“protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Canceling \nfunding for direct representation services to UCs when appropriations are available (as they are) \nviolates this express congressional mandate. \nThe TVPRA, which requires Defendants to “ensure [UC direct representation] to the \ngreatest extent practicable,” prohibits Defendants refusing to fund direct representation so long as \nDefendants have available appropriations (as they do).  See, e.g., Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18 \n(APA violated when agencies withheld appropriated funds because they were “required, ‘to the \nextent of available appropriations,’ to ensure provision of support services for resettled refugees”).  \nDefendants terminated funding and ordered Plaintiffs to cease work without providing any other \navenues of legal services for UCs—failing to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that UCs \nhave  access  to  legal  counsel.    The  Cancellation  Order  effectively  ends  meaningful  direct \nrepresentation for UCs.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶¶ 20–21. \nAlthough the TVPRA grants Defendants some discretion in how to allocate appropriated \nfunds for legal access, it does not grant discretion to choose not to allocate appropriated funds at \nall.  Defendants cannot simply cease funding for direct representation in its entirety, as they did \nhere.  See Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18.  Further, Defendants failed to provide any guidance \nto Plaintiffs regarding their ongoing UC representations, or any alternative plan for carrying out \ntheir duties under the statute and applicable ethical rules.  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) Ex. 3. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n11 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 22 of 36\n     \n \nE.  Terminating Direct Representation Programs Violates the ORR Foundational Rule. \nThe government is “bound by the regulations it imposes upon itself.”  See United States v. \n1996 Freightliner Fld. Tractor VIN 1FUYDXYB-TP822291, 634 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nUnder the Accardi doctrine, parties may bring claims under the APA asserting that an agency has \nfailed to follow its own rules and internal policies.  See, e.g., Alcaraz v. I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, \n1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nFor an Accardi claim, Plaintiffs must show (1) the government violated its own regulations; \nand (2) Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced by that violation.  See Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. \nMayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024); see also Carnation Co. v. Sec’y \nof Lab., 641 F.2d 801, 804 n.4 (9th Cir. 1981) (the Accardi standard is “whether violation of the \nregulation prejudiced the party involved”).  Defendants’ actions violate their express commitment \nin the binding Foundational Rule to fund direct representation as long as appropriations are \navailable.  Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced because they are mission-bound to serve their UC \nclients in cases formerly funded by Defendants, and there are no other government-funded legal \nservice providers to whom Plaintiffs can transfer those cases.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8; Estrella \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 3, 16; KIND Decl. (Dkt. 7-18) ¶ 19; VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶ 2; see also MM \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 4-5; DHCC Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs are spending discretionary funds to maintain \nrepresentations for as long as possible because withdrawing is antithetical to their missions and, \nfor some, impermissible under local ethics rules, particularly where no other service providers can \ntake the cases.  Without an injunction, Plaintiffs will have to choose between bankruptcy and \nabandoning their missions .  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; GHIRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7–8; RMIAN Decl. \n(Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 14; Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 15; see also infra Section II.A.  \nORR has “recognize[d] that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n12 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 23 of 36\n     \n \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, \n34529 (Apr. 30, 2024); see also Al Otro Lado, 2024 WL 4370577, at *9 (preambles may \nsufficiently bind agencies under Accardi).  Just last year, ORR stated its intention to provide \n“universal legal representation for unaccompanied children by FY 2027.”  HHS: Administration \nfor Children & Families, Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees, at 78 (2024), \nhttps://shorturl.at/4VDSL; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 34526 (“ORR strives for 100 percent legal \nrepresentation of unaccompanied children.”).  Thus, in 2024, ORR adopted the Foundational Rule, \nwhich states in relevant part: \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is \nnot practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service \nproviders  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations. \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  Defendants’ actions on March 21, 2025, subvert \nthese ORR commitments and regulations, violate the Accardi doctrine, and are both contrary to \nlaw and arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 411 \nF. Supp. 3d 1036, 1068–69 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (agency’s violation of its own procedures violates the \nAPA).  Congressional appropriations are readily available until September 2027 to fund direct \nrepresentation, including funds appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025, one week before \nDefendants’ challenged actions.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions \nAct, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  \nWithout explanation and without a plan to replace these critical legal services for unaccompanied \nchildren, the Cancellation Order violates Defendants’ obligations and has caused and will continue \nto cause Plaintiffs substantial hardship, as described below.  See also infra Section II.A.  Because \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n13 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 24 of 36\n     \n \nDefendants’  actions  violate  their  own  stated  policies  and  substantially  prejudice  Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.   \nF.  Terminating Funding for Direct Representation is Arbitrary and Capricious. \nDefendants’ decision to stop funding any direct representation for any UCs ignores the \nwell-documented  efficacy  of  direct  representation  for  UCs  and  is  arbitrary  and  capricious.  \nDefendants have refused to produce any administrative record to justify their decision until they \nfile their answer.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 14.  Plaintiffs and the Court are left to evaluate Defendants’ \njustification through statements in the Stop Work Order, Cancellation Order, and filings in this \naction.  The Stop Work Order provides no explanation, Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 1, and the Cancellation \nOrder says only that the decision was for Defendants’ “convenience,” id. at Ex. 3.  This leaves the \nCourt with only Defendants’ post-hoc justifications offered through litigation, but these are plainly \ninsufficient.  Dept. of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the U. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 23 (2020) (agencies \ncannot  support  their  actions  via  “belated  justifications”  or  “convenient  litigating  positions” \n(quotation marks and citations omitted).  To the extent such reasons are properly before the Court, \nDefendants’ proffered justifications of saving money and encouraging pro bono representation fail \nto address the requirements outlined above.  See Dkt. 24-1 ¶¶ 14–15; Dkt. 24 at 8. \nA court “shall” set aside agency action if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983); see also Humane Soc. of U.S. v. \nLocke, 626 F.3d 1040, 1048 (9th Cir. 2010).  Agency action should be set aside as arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency fails to explain the basis of its decision, fails to consider all relevant factors \nand articulate a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,” or fails to offer \na “reasoned analysis” for departure from preexisting policies.  Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 \nU.S. at 42–43.  In cases where the purported rationale for agency action is pretextual, it must be \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n14 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 25 of 36\n     \n \nset aside.  See, e.g., Dep't of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780-85 (2019); Transportation Div. \nof the Int'l Ass’n of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, & Transp. Workers v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 988 F.3d 1170, \n1182-85 (9th Cir. 2021).  Here, Defendants fail on all grounds, justifying preliminary injunctive \nrelief (as well as ultimate relief on the merits).  \n1.  Defendants Failed to Adequately Explain the Basis for the Decision. \nA “fundamental requirement of administrative law is that an agency set forth its reasons \nfor decision; an agency’s failure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action.”  \nTourus Recs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 259 F.3d 731, 737 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quotation \nmarks omitted);  see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).  Unsupported \nconclusions are insufficient, see City and Cnty of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizen and Immigration \nServs., 981 F.3d 742, 761 (9th Cir. 2020) (rejecting agency’s “conclusory mantra” and lack of \n“detailed  justification”),  as  are  post  hoc  rationalizations  in  briefing,  unsupported  by  an \nadministrative record, see Humane Soc’y of U.S., 626 F.3d at 1049-50. \nDefendants’ decision to cut all funding for direct representation they have funded for more \nthan a decade—with appropriations available until at least September 30, 2027—came with no \nexplanation, let alone one that can stand up to judicial scrutiny.  Defendants have refused to \nproduce any administrative record at this stage that could justify their actions.  See, Amica Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 14.  Even if Defendants’ post-hoc justifications offered in this case could be considered, \nDefendants fail to address the fact that Congress has already appropriated these funds through \nSeptember 2027, and offer no explanation of how a “shift” to pro bono services could fulfill their \nTVPRA and Foundational Rule obligations to provide counsel “to the greatest extent possible.”  \nDefendants also offer no evidence they are doing anything to facilitate a “shift,” and even if they \nwere, they created a significant shortfall in representation in the interim.  \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n15 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 26 of 36\n     \n \nHistory and congressional statements show pro bono counsel alone cannot provide counsel \n“to the greatest extent possible,” under the TVPRA.  See Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 51–63 (citing original sources).  \nORR already tried relying solely on pro bono counsel.  The idea that funding representation \nactually “disincentivizes the recruitment of and the volunteering of pro bono counsel” (Dkt. 24-1 \n¶ 24) gets the history backward—funded representation stepped in to fill huge representation gaps \nleft by relying only on pro bono capacity.  See also Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 5 (of the 64,008 \nindividuals Estrella served in 2024, they have only secured pro bono assistance for one).  ORR’s \n2008 pro bono pilot program produced a report acknowledging pro bono counsel alone were \ninsufficient to represent UCs.  See Olga Byrne & Elise Miller, The Flow of Unaccompanied \nChildren Through the Immigration System, at 22–23 (Mar. 2012), https://shorturl.at/KI3Jt.  That \nis why ORR started funding direct representation.  See Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 57–59. \nFunding legal services providers like Plaintiffs increases pro bono representation of UCs, \nbecause Plaintiffs oversee and mentor large networks of pro bono attorneys—non-experts in \nimmigration who could not represent UCs without the aid of immigration professionals.  See, e.g., \nDkt. 7-4 ¶¶ 11, 44; Dkt. 7-7 ¶ 2; NWIRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.  When Plaintiff “ImmDef has worked \nwith pro bono attorneys to provide legal representation for children, [they] have found that even \nlicensed attorneys who are not specialized in this area of law need intensive training [from \nImmDef] and support to be able to effectively represent their clients.”  Dkt. 7-8 ¶ 11.  “[P]ro bono \nattorneys do not generally have immigration expertise,” most do not speak the languages UCs \nspeak, many “are unwilling to commit to the timeframe of children’s immigration cases or with \nthe special care needed when working with children,” and pro bono attorneys need experts to “train \nand support [them].”  Dkt. 7-6 ¶ 12; see also RMIAN Supp. Decl. ¶ 9 (“The vast majority of \nRMIAN’s volunteer attorneys do not have immigration law experience and would never consider \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n16 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 27 of 36\n     \n \ntaking an immigration case without RMIAN’s [support.]”); Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 11; VAAP Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 8; DHCC Supp. Decl. ¶ 7; Public Counsel Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; NIJC Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 6–8; KIND \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 7.  The Cancellation Order cut funding for this essential mentorship and training.  \nAmica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8.  And Plaintiffs cannot sustain their representations (or take new ones) \nwithout funding.  See, infra, at 20–22; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 7–12.  Defendants’ post hoc “shift” \njustification is contradicted by facts and history—and by what funding Defendants chose to cut. \nDefendant’s attempt to justify this as a cost-saving measure is likewise unavailing.  Dkt. \n24-1  ¶ 18.    The  TVPRA  and  the  Foundational  Rule  require  Defendants  to  fund  direct \nrepresentation to the “greatest extent practicable” with appropriated funds.  See, supra, at 11, 13.  \nAnd  Congress  has  ordered  Defendants  to  spend  appropriated  funding  to  provide  funded \nrepresentation for UCs.  For example, in 2022, the House Appropriations Committee, in support \nof “the continued expansion of independent legal services for unaccompanied children,” directed \nthat funded representations should “be made available to children up to funded capacity.” H. Rep. \n117-403, at 200 (emphasis added).  An administration’s “policy” of cutting spending is simply not \na legally cognizable reason to refuse to spend appropriated funds: the Executive cannot withhold \nor delay disbursement of appropriated funds, even if it “has policy reasons . . . for wanting to spend \nless than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program.”  See In re \nAiken Cnty, 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (plurality). \nBecause even these post hoc reasons offered in litigation fall apart under the slightest \nscrutiny, the decision is arbitrary and capricious.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. \nCt. 2117, 2125 (2016) (“Where the agency has failed to provide even a minimal level of analysis” \nfor its decision, “its action is arbitrary and capricious.”). \n2.  Defendants Failed to Consider All Relevant Factors and Articulate a Rational \nConnection Between the Facts Found and the Choice Made. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n17 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 28 of 36\n     \n \nTo survive arbitrary and capricious review, an agency must have “demonstrated a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Wawszkiewicz v. Dep’t of Treasury, \n670 F.2d 296, 301 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts “do not defer \nto the agency’s conclusory or unsupported suppositions.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Engs., 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 121–22 (D.D.C. 2017) (quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  Even crediting Defendants’ ‘shift to pro bono’ rationale, Defendants have not offered \nany analysis or findings that could show that such a “shift” is justified and could provide counsel \n“to the greatest extent practicable.”  And significant evidence demonstrates that ending funding \nfor direct representation will decrease the number of pro bono representations as well.  See, supra, \nat 16–17.  Where, as here, “no findings and no analysis . . . justify the choice made,” the APA \n“will not permit” a court to accept the agency’s decision.  Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United \nStates, 371 U.S. 156, 167 (1962).  Because Defendants “should have considered those matters but \ndid not,” their “failure was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.”  Dep’t of Homeland \nSec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 33 (2020). \n3.  Defendants Failed to Offer a Reasoned Explanation for Their Policy Reversal. \nWhen the government reverses its own established policy, it has an even greater burden to \njustify its actions.  The agency must “acknowledge and provide an adequate explanation for its \ndeparture from established precedent, and an agency that neglects to do so acts arbitrarily and \ncapriciously.”  Jicarilla Apache Nation v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 613 F.3d 1112, 1119 (D.C. \nCir. 2010) (quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 221–\n22 (an agency cannot depart from prior policy without “explaining its changed position”).   \nDefendants’ refusal to fund any direct representation for UCs is a reversal of more than a \ndecade  of  funding  direct  representation,  continued  year  after  year  by  congressional  reports \ndirecting Defendants to fund direct representation and to expand such funding.  By cancelling \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n18 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 29 of 36\n     \n \nfunding with no explanation—or at most an insufficient and pretextual explanation—Defendants \nhave acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  See Jicarilla Apache Nation, 613 F.3d at 1119. \n4.  To the Extent Defendants Offer Any Reasons, Those Reasons Are Pretextual. \nDefendants’  two purported reasons for cutting off required  funding are pretextual—\nDefendants want to substitute the Executive’s policy goals for Congress’s own considered policies \nthat it expressed in the TVPRA and following appropriations bills and reports.  See, supra, at 13, \n17.  Defendants have twice tried to stop funding legal representation for UCs.  The February 18, \n2025, Stop Work Order gave no reason and, to the contrary, stressed to Acacia that the order had \nnothing to do with “poor performance” of the funded services.  See Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 1.  The March \n21,  2025,  Cancellation  Order  also  gave  no  reason—it  simply  cited  “the  Government’s \nconvenience.”  See id. at Ex. 3.  Recent court filings reveal the Cancellation Order was issued \nshortly after a Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”) staffer was detailed to the HHS \ndepartment overseeing ORR “to identify waste, fraud, and abuse” under the DOGE Executive \nOrder and given access to the extremely sensitive database of information about unaccompanied \nchildren.  See Am. Fed. Of Labor and Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Dept. of Labor, No. 1:25-cv-\n00339-JDB, Dkt. 73-2 at 11-12 (D.D.C.).  Defendants now admit the decision was made because \nof “this Administration’s policy goals,” Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 18, and offer two pretextual justifications for \nthose goals.  But “[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or \nwithhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.”  City & Cnty. of \nSan Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  That is what happened here, and \nDefendants have declined to produce a record that could show otherwise.   \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n19 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 30 of 36\n     \n \nII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction \nA.  Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm \nA preliminary injunction is appropriate where, as here, the moving party shows that it faces \nirreparable harm—harm which is (1) “immediate”, Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 \nF.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988), and (2) “for which there is no adequate legal remedy.”  Ariz. Dream \nAct Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nThe Court correctly found Plaintiffs “are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief.”  Dkt. 33 at 5.  Defendants have not complied with the Court’s Order, making \nthe requested injunctive relief all the more critical.  Defendants’ termination of funding for direct \nrepresentation directly interferes with Plaintiffs’ missions, immediately impeding their ability to \nprovide legal representation that is at the heart of Plaintiffs’ missions.  FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 5–\n8; GHIRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7–8; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 7–12; VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7; Estrella \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 4; RMIAN Decl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 22; VAAP Decl.

There  is  no  question  ceasing  funding  for  direct \nrepresentation for UCs and terminating existing services causes imminent and irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs and their missions.  FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 37; NIJC Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 9.  The Cancellation Order prevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of UCs the direct \nrepresentation required by the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ primary \nmissions of ensuring UCs are supported by legal counsel, including by representing these children \nas contemplated by Congress and the TVPRA.  See, e.g., FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; ImmDef Decl. ¶ \n2.  If this occurs, “‘there can be no do over and no redress.’”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North \nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014)).   \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n20 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 31 of 36\n     \n \nPlaintiffs relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding would remain \navailable.  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 11; RMIAN Decl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 18.  Cutting off funding \nthreatens immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs’ missions and existence.  See, e.g., CLSEPA \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-16) ¶ 13; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶¶ 22–24; KIND Decl. (Dkt. 7-18) ¶¶ 16–19.  For \nexample,  on  April  1,  2025,  ImmDef  had  to  lay  off  twenty-four  staff  funded  under  the \nUnaccompanied Children’s Program in response to the Cancellation Order; these staff losses \nthreaten its ability to continue representing its 1,900 UC clients.  ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; \nImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶¶ 20–22.  Since their initial declaration in this matter, VAAP has had to \nterminate 25% of their staff.  VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  Amica Center has been unable to fill \nvacancies and expects it will only be able to fund representation of UC clients another 2 months, \nat most, before it materially limits other mission-driven work.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  Estrella \ndel Paso has 324 cases and predicts the loss of funding will require layoffs and increase caseloads \nfor its staff.  Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 6. The Galveston-Houston Immigration Representation \nProject expects to lay off most of their Immigrant Children and Youth staff within four weeks.  \nGHIRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-17) ¶ 23.  Sustaining these services, in accordance with its mission but \nwithout this funding, will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.  NWIRP \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-10) ¶ 13.  Private providers and other organizations predict devastating financial \nconsequences, including the potential for bankruptcy.  DHCC Decl. (Dkt. 7-5) ¶ 20; MM Decl. \n(Dkt. 7-19) ¶ 18; see also KIND Supp. Decl. ¶ 4 (“[O]n March 27, 2025, KIND laid off over 240 \nstaff members in legal services psychosocial services, and other program support roles”).  These \nlosses do not account for the organizational knowledge at risk of being lost.  Estrella Decl. (Dkt. \n7-14) ¶ 6; FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 38; Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 25; ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) \n¶ 21. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n21 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 32 of 36\n     \n \nThe harm to Plaintiffs and their clients is imminent, irreparable, and ongoing, particularly \ngiven Defendants’ failure to comply with this Court’s Order.  The March 21, 2025, Cancellation \nOrder terminated funding immediately, but provided no guidance as to how Plaintiffs could meet \ntheir existing obligations, including immigration court hearings scheduled for that week.  DHCC \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-5) ¶ 15; Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 20; ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs have \nethical obligations to their clients and cannot immediately withdraw from representations; most \nattorneys require court permission to withdraw.  FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 39.  Plaintiffs and their \nclients are already experiencing irreparable harm far exceeding the mere loss of funding, including \nbecause they have had to furlough or layoff staff and increase the caseloads of staff who can stay \non.  See e.g. ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶¶ 20–22; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3–4; NWIRP Supp. Decl. ¶ \n5; Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  After reserves run out, ImmDef will be forced “to take drastic action \nto terminate staff across all positions funded under this contract.” ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 21.  \nChildren’s immigration cases “are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly \nskilled attorneys to competently handle them.”   Id. at ¶ 23.  Impacted staff have  years of \nindividualized experience with clients, making replacing them impracticable.   \nHarms to children will be swift and severe, further frustrating Plaintiffs’ missions to ensure \nas many noncitizens as possible receive legal support.  For example, “if a child at one of the ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal need such as an outstanding \nremoval order, Amica Center—the only legal provider with access to the ORR-subcontracted \nfacility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to protect the child from \nimminent removal.”  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 21; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8 (to their knowledge \n“no children  in the ORR-subcontracted facilities with which  [they] work have successfully \nobtained pro bono representation since March 21.”).  This is even more troubling in light of policies \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n22 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 33 of 36\n     \n \nincreasing the need for legal services, including notices on March 21, 2025 (the day of the \nCancellation Order) that “DHS would begin serving Notices to Appear (NTAs) ‘imminently’ on \nchildren in ORR custody and that those Master Calendar Hearings were expected to take place ‘in \nthe coming days and weeks.’” Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 76; FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 5–8; NIJC Supp. \nDecl. ¶¶ 4, 9.  Without funding or guidance, Plaintiffs will not be able to fulfill their missions and \nrepresent UCs in these proceedings.  See RMIAN Supp. Decl. ¶ 6–7.  As Plaintiff ImmDef \nexplains, “[a]t this very moment, there are children in ORR custody who need our representation \nwho are not receiving it.  This means that children who want voluntary departure will have their \nreturn home unacceptably delayed, victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections \nthey deserve, and children fleeing persecution will not be able to have their day in court.”  ImmDef \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 25.  Absent a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm. \nB.  The Balance of Equities  \nFinally, in considering whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the Court should “balance \nthe competing claims of injury and . . . consider the effect on each party of the granting or \nwithholding of the requested relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 (9th \nCir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at ).  Where an injunction will not “substantially injure the \nother [interested] parties,” the balance of equities tips in plaintiffs’ favor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  \nHere, the balance of the equities “tip[] sharply in the [Plaintiffs’] favor,” supporting a preliminary \ninjunction.  Cottrell, 632 F.3d at 1135. \nDefendants will not be harmed by a preliminary injunction: as the Court found, “[t]he \nGovernment fails to convince that it would suffer harm” from injunctive relief.  Dkt. 33 at 6.  The \nGovernment “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Instead, “there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n23 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 34 of 36\n     \n \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”  State v. Azar, 385 F. Supp. \n3d 960, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds and remanded sub nom. California ex rel. \nBecerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Newby, 838 F.3d at 12) (cleaned up). \nTerminating funding for direct representation for UCs, without any plan to ensure current \nrepresentations are not interrupted, violates Congress’s directive in the TVPRA and ORR’s own \ncommitments in the Foundational Rule.  And as the Court found, “the maintenance of funding for \ndirect legal representation services furthers the critical public interests of ensuring children have \naccess to legal representation and protection from human trafficking.”  Dkt. 33 at 6.  Maintaining \n“funding of legal representation for unaccompanied children promotes efficiency and fairness \nwithin the immigration system.”  Id.; see also Dkt. 28 (former immigration judges explaining the \nimportance  of  continued  funding);  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  34528-29  (recognizing  benefit  of  UC \nrepresentation to the immigration system generally); see also Dkt. 7 at 29.  \nBecause Defendants do not face any injury from the issuance of an injunction to stop their \nillegal  action  and  Plaintiffs  and  the  public  have  a  substantial  interest  in  maintaining  legal \nrepresentation, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction.  \nDefendants’ failure to comply with this Court’s Order only further weighs in favor of a preliminary \ninjunction here. \nIII.  A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate \nWhile injunctive relief must be tailored to the scope of the case, “there is no bar against . . . \nnationwide  relief  in  federal  district  or  circuit  court  when  it  is  appropriate,”  such  as  when \nnationwide “breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”  \nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170–71(9th Cir. 1987).  A number of factors counsel in favor \nof a nationwide injunction here.  First, APA injunctions are often nationwide, because when \nDefendants violated the APA, they did so without geographic limitation.  See E. Bay Sanctuary \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n24 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 35 of 36\n     \n \nCovenant, 993 F.3d at 680-81 (cleaned up).  Second, nationwide injunctions are also common in \ncases  like  this  that  involve  immigration  policy  set  by  Congress,  because  “a  fragmented \nimmigration policy would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory requirement for uniform \nimmigration law and policy.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2017).  \nThird, plaintiffs are located throughout the country, and “[d]ifferent interpretations of executive \npolicy across circuit or state lines will needlessly complicate agency and individual action,” see E. \nBay Sanctuary Covenant, 993 F.3d at 681, and piecemeal injunctive relief for the more than 80 \nproviders nationwide would be impractical to administer.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, \n326–27 (4th Cir. 2021).  The only complete and manageable relief is a nationwide injunction.  See \nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).   \nIV.  The Court Should Not Require an Injunction Bond \nCourts have broad discretion in determining whether a bond should be required under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).  Walczak v. EPL Prolong, Inc., 198 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir. \n1999).  And a district court may “dispense with the security requirement” entirely, or “request \nmere nominal security,” if “requiring security would effectively deny access to judicial review.”  \nCal. ex rel. Van De Kamp v. Tahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 766 F.2d 1319, 1325 (9th Cir.1985); \nsee also Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *19.  The Court found no injunction \nbond was necessary under Rule 65(c) to issue a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 33 at 7, and it \nshould reach the same conclusion for a preliminary injunction—where the analysis is the same.   \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants’ actions violate the APA.  Because this conduct causes Plaintiffs immediate \nand irreparable harm, this Court should grant provisional nationwide relief enjoining Defendants’ \nillegal actions and preserving the status quo pending a final judgment.  The Court should tailor its \nrelief in light of Defendants’ failure to comply with the temporary restraining order.\nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n25 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 36 of 36\n     \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nApril 4, 2025 \n/s/  Alvaro M.

See, e.g., Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 \nS.Ct. 966, 968 (2025).  Furthermore, the underlying TRO ignores fundamental \njurisdictional limits under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tucker \nAct, asserting authority over monetary claims that Congress has exclusively vested \nin the Court of Federal Claims. En banc review is therefore warranted to secure \nuniformity of decisions within the Circuit, to resolve a question of exceptional \nimportance concerning judicial power over the public fisc, and to correct a manifest \njurisdictional error impacting the separation of powers. \n   \n2 \n \n\n(3 of 23), Page 3 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 3 of 23\nSTATEMENT OF GROUNDS FOR REHEARING EN BANC \nThis petition satisfies Fed. R. App. P. 35(b)(1) for two mutually reinforcing \nreasons: \nI.  The Panel Decision Conflicts with Controlling Supreme Court and \nNinth Circuit Authority on Appealability.  \nIn dismissing Appellants’ appeal (and denying Appellants’ emergency motion \nto stay as moot), the Panel summarily concluded that the district court’s temporary \nrestraining order “is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1),” and cited E. Bay \nSanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 762 (9th Cir. 2018) and Washington v. \nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1158 (9th Cir. 2017). Order, Dkt. Entry. No. 16.1  \nThis holding irreconcilably conflicts with the Supreme Court’s recent decision \nin Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025), which is on all fours with \nthis case.  There, the Supreme Court vacated a TRO that, like the district court’s \nTRO here, compelled the government to continue funding terminated government \ncontracts. Id. at 1. The Supreme Court held that such an order, despite its label, \nfunctions as an appealable preliminary injunction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), \nparticularly when that order follows an adversarial hearing, was strongly challenged \non  jurisdictional  and  merits  grounds,  and  mandates  potentially  irrecoverable \nexpenditures.  Id.  The order here shares all of those characteristics, and is thus \nplainly appealable under the Supreme Court’s recent ruling—yet the panel did not \neven acknowledge Dep’t of Education.  \n2 \n \n\n(4 of 23), Page 4 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 4 of 23\nThe Panel decision also conflicts with this Court’s own precedent, which \nrecognizes that TROs are appealable where they follow an adversarial hearing, are \nstrongly challenged, and remain in force beyond Rule 65(b)’s 14-day temporal limit, \nthereby having the practical effect of a preliminary injunction. See E. Bay Sanctuary \nCovenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 762 (9th Cir. 2018); see also Washington v. \nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1158 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam).  The Panel cited those \ndecisions yet gave no reason to distinguish this case.  The Panel thus created an intra-\ncircuit  split  by  its  dismissal,  which  warrants  rehearing  en  banc  to  secure  the \nuniformity of this Court’s precedents on the critical and increasingly oft-litigated \nissue of when TROs function as appealable injunctions. \nII.  The Case Presents an Exceptionally Important Question Regarding \nFederal  Court  Jurisdiction  Over  Monetary  Claims  Against  the \nGovernment.  \nBy improperly deeming the district court’s order an unappealable TRO, the \nPanel’s  decision  also  precludes  further  appellate  review  of  the  district  court’s \ncontravention  of  recent  Supreme  Court  precedent  on  a  critically  important \njurisdictional issue.  As underscored by Dep’t of Education, the APA does not waive \nsovereign immunity for claims seeking monetary relief or specific performance of \ncontractual  funding  obligations.    Indeed,  the  APA  does  not  waive  sovereign \nimmunity over any claims involving monetary relief. 5 U.S.C. § 702 (waiving \nsovereign immunity over actions seeking relief “other than money damages[.]”); see \nalso Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968.  Rather, such claims, including those disguised \n3 \n \n\n(5 of 23), Page 5 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 5 of 23\nas requests for equitable relief, fall within the Tucker Act’s channeling of review to \nthe Court of Federal Claims. See Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968. Yet the district \ncourt here sidestepped that rule, and the Panel’s refusal to review TROs at all \neffectively allows the district court to usurp HHS’s discretionary authority and seize \nArticle II powers that district courts cannot exercise—an irreparable injury in of \nitself.  Not only that, allowing district courts to manage federal funding decisions \ninflicts  irreparable  injury  on  the  public  fisc  through  unreviewable,  compelled \nexpenditures.  Id. at 969 (recognizing irreparable harm to the government where “it \nis unlikely to recover [compelled] funds once they are disbursed,” and particularly \nwhere “the District Court declined to impose bond”). This presents a question of \nexceptional importance warranting en banc consideration. \nBACKGROUND \nOn March 20, 2025, ORR, which is a component of HHS, directed DOI to \npartially terminate ORR’s contract with the Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”).  \nUnder  its  contract,  Acacia  provides  legal  services  and  other  assistance  to \nunaccompanied alien children who are in the care of or released from the care of \nORR.1  This  partial  termination  was  executed  through  a  formal  decision \n \n1   See Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto v. HHS, No. 3:25-cv-02847 \n(N.D. Cal.), Attachment 1 (Decl. of Toby R. Biswas (Mar. 1, 2025), ECF No. 24-1, \n¶¶ 11–13. \n4 \n \n\n(6 of 23), Page 6 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 6 of 23\nmemorandum signed by the DOI Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration \nfor Children and Families (“ACF”).2  \nOn  March  26,  2025,  eleven  organizations  (“Appellees”),  including \nCommunity Legal Services in East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”), who subcontract with \nAcacia, filed this lawsuit against Appellants, claiming that Appellants’ notice of the \npartial  termination  of  the  Acacia  contract  violated  the  William  Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, and HHS’s applicable \nregulations.3    ECF  No.  1.  Appellees  sought  relief  under  the  Administrative \nProcedure Act.  Id.  \nOn  March  27,  2025,  Appellees  moved  for  a  temporary  restraining  order \n(“TRO”), under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b), or, alternatively, for a preliminary injunction, \nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a).  ECF No. 7. Later the same day, the district court issued \nan order directing Appellants to respond in writing to the TRO motion no later than \nnoon on March 31, 2025 and set a hearing for April 1, 2025.

ECF No. 24. Appellants argued, among other things, that \nthe district court lacked jurisdiction over Appellees’ claims, because they seek \nmonetary relief arising out of the partial termination of a government contract, which \nis covered by the Tucker Act, and because the APA does not waive sovereign \nimmunity for contract claims for which a plaintiff purports to seek equitable relief.  \nECF No. 24 at 15–18 (citing N. Star Alaska v. United States, 14 F.3d 36, 38 (9th Cir. \n1994)).  Appellants noted that claims based upon a contract with the United States \nare  subject  to  the  jurisdictional  restrictions  in  the  Tucker  Act,  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a)(1).  ECF No. 24 at 16–18 (citing North Side Lumber v. Block, 753 F.2d \n1482, 1486 (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 931 (1985); Megapulse, Inc. v. \nLewis, 672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).   \nOn April 1, 2025, the district court held a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a \nTRO, where counsel for both sides were present and permitted to present argument \nfor nearly 90 minutes.  Later that day, the district court issued an order in which it \ngranted Plaintiffs’ request for a TRO, to be effective starting at 8:00 am PST on \nApril 2, 2025.  ECF No. 33.  \nIn  a  six-page  memorandum,  the  district  court  applied  the  traditional \npreliminary-injunction  factors  and  concluded  that  Appellees  had  raised  serious \nquestions regarding the merits.  Id. at 3–5. Further, the district court concluded that \nAppellees showed that they were likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n6 \n \n\n(8 of 23), Page 8 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 8 of 23\npreliminary  relief  because  the  termination  of  funding  has  allegedly  “forc[ed]” \nAppellees “to issue layoff notices and threatening to require them to dismiss their \nhighly-specialized and seasoned attorneys.”  Id. at 5. Finally, the district court \ndisagreed with Defendants’ allegation that the government would suffer harm from \nbeing  compelled  to  spend  down  congressionally  appropriated  funds  during  the \npendency of the preliminary injunctive relief.  Id. 6.  The district court concluded \nthat Appellants’ termination of the contract “potentially violates Congress’s express \ndirective in the TVPRA and ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule,” \nid., and observed that “[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of \nunlawful agency action,” id. at 5 – 6 (quoting League of Women Voters of United \nStates v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citations omitted)).  \nThe district court ordered that  \nDefendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of March \n20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \nof 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and ORR’s Foundational \nRule,  45  C.F.R.  §  410.1309(a)(4),  particularly  ORR’s  provision  of \nfunds  for  direct  legal  representation  services  to  unaccompanied \nchildren. This injunction precludes cutting off access to congressionally \nappropriated funding for its duration. \n \nECF No. 33 at 7.   \n Following the district court’s entry of the TRO here, the Supreme Court \ngranted the government’s request to vacate the TRO at issue in Dep’t of Education.  \nThere,  the  Supreme  Court  held  that  the  government  was  “likely  to  succeed  in \n7 \n \n\n(9 of 23), Page 9 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 9 of 23\nshowing the District Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under \nthe APA” such that the district court could not compel the government to continue \npaying  terminated  Department  of  Education  grants;  instead,  such  cases  must \nproceed, if at all, in the Court of Federal Claims.  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968.  \nImmediately  thereafter,  Appellants  moved  on  April  4,  2025  to  dissolve  the \ntemporary  restraining  order,  ECF  No.  38—filed  subsequent  to  Appellees’  own \nmotion for a preliminary injunction earlier that day, ECF No. 37. In the alternative, \nAppellants requested a stay of the TRO.  \nOn April 7, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an emergency motion to enforce the TRO. \nECF No. 40.  Later that day, the Court ordered Defendants to submit a status report \nrecounting the specific steps taken to comply with the injunction. ECF No. 42. \nOn April 8, Appellants moved to recuse the district court judge pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 455 and for reassignment of the case.  ECF No. 47.  In their motion, \nAppellants  noted,  inter  alia,  the  district  court  judge’s  past  employment  with \nCLSEPA, one of the Appellees, and the relevance of the judge’s employment to the \nissues in this case.  Id. at 4 – 5, 7.  Defendants also submitted a status report regarding \ncompliance with the TRO.  ECF No. 45.  \nOn April 10, the district court issued an order in which it extended the TRO \nand ordered that it remain in effect until April 30, 2025, at 7:59 am PST.  ECF No. \n8 \n \n\n(10 of 23), Page 10 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 10 of 23\n48.  The district court thus extended the TRO so that its duration is 27 days, 23 hours \nand 59 minutes, or, put another way, exactly one minute short of 28 days.4   \nOn April 11, 2025, the government filed a notice of appeal, and on April 14, \n2025, the government moved for a stay of the TRO. DktEntry 5.1. On April 15, the \nNinth Circuit Panel ordered the government to file a statement explaining why the \nappeal should not be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. DktEntry 6.1. On April 16, \nthe government filed its statement, explaining that the Ninth Circuit had jurisdiction \nbecause the TRO carried the hallmarks of a preliminary injunction given that the \ngovernment strongly challenged the TRO; the district court held a hearing before \ngranting the TRO; and the district court extended the TRO beyond the 14-day \ntimeframe in Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2). DktEntry 16.1. On April 18, the Panel issued \na two-sentence decision dismissing the appeal because it lacked jurisdiction, citing \nE.  Bay  Sanctuary  Covenant  v.  Trump,  932  F.3d  742,  762  (9th  Cir.  2018)  and \nWashington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1158 (9th Cir. 2017). DktEntry 16.1. \n \n4 The district court stated that:  \nBefore the Court is Defendants’ motion for recusal and reassignment. \nThe  Court  must  address  this  pending  motion  before  further \nconsideration of the case.  Thus, the Court finds that consideration of \nthe motion for recusal constitutes good cause requiring extension of \nthe [TRO] dated April 1, 2025 . . . Accordingly, the Court hereby \nEXTENDS the TRO, and it shall remain in effect until Wednesday, \nApril 30, 2025, at 7:59 a.m. PST.  \nECF No. 48.   \n9 \n \n\n(11 of 23), Page 11 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 11 of 23\nOn April 21, 2025, the district court denied the government’s motion to \ndissolve, distinguishing Dep’t of Education because the Supreme Court found that \nthe TRO in that case “required” the government to pay past-due balances. See ECF \nNo. 75.  It also explained that no contract exists in this case because Plaintiffs do not \nhave a contract with the federal government. Id. at 4–5.  \nARGUMENT \n \nI.  Rehearing En Banc is Warranted Because the Panel’s Decision \nDirectly  Conflicts  with  Supreme  Court  and  Ninth  Circuit \nPrecedent.  \n \nRehearing en banc is warranted here because the Panel decision conflicts with \nthe Supreme Court’s decision in Dep’t of Education v. California, 145 S.Ct. 966, \n968 (2025). Fed. R. App. P. 40(b).  In Dep’t of Education, the Supreme Court held \nthat the TRO “carries many of the hallmarks of a preliminary injunction” because \nthe government “strongly challenged” the basis for the district court’s jurisdiction, \nand that the government was likely to succeed in showing the district court lacked \njurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA. Id. The relevant facts in \nthis case are nearly identical to those in Dep’t of Education: the government strongly \nopposed the TRO in its brief and at a hearing, and the government is likely to succeed \non the merits of its argument that the district court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ \nAPA claims because Plaintiffs seek monetary relief.  Specifically, Plaintiffs’ TRO \nmotion asks the district court to enjoin Defendants from “cutting off access to \ncongressionally appropriated funding” for direct legal representation services.  ECF \n10 \n \n\n(12 of 23), Page 12 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 12 of 23\nNo. 7 at 37.  Indeed, the precise harm that Plaintiffs allege is plainly monetary: their \npurported “lack of funding.”  Id. at 16–17 (“ceasing funding . . . will cause imminent \nharm,” which Plaintiffs quantify through specific operational costs they will bear to \nsustain services “without this funding”). \nThe Panel’s decision also conflicts with a decision of the Ninth Circuit, and \nthe full court’s consideration is therefore necessary to secure or maintain uniformity \nof its decisions. Fed. R. App. P. 40(a). Like the Supreme Court, the Ninth Circuit \nhas held that a TRO may be appealed as an interlocutory order if it “possesses the \nqualities of a preliminary injunction.” Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1158 \n(9th Cir. 2017). “This rule has ordinarily required the would-be appellant to show \nthat the TRO was strongly challenged in adversarial proceedings before the district \ncourt and that it has or will remain in force for longer than the fourteen-day period \nidentified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b).” Id. (finding that the TRO was \nappealable where the government “vigorously contested the legal basis for the TRO \nin written briefs and oral arguments” and the TRO was in place more than 14 days); \nsee also E. Bay, 932 F.3d at 762 (same). As explained supra, the TRO here functions \nas  a  preliminary  injunction.  Despite  the  government’s  showing  that  it  strongly \nopposed the TRO in its written briefs and at oral argument, that the TRO will be in \nplace more than 14 days, and that the government is likely to prevail on the merits \nin  light  of  Dep’t  of  Education,  145  S.  Ct.  at  968,  the  Panel  dismissed  the \ngovernment’s appeal without any analysis explaining how the government did not \n11 \n \n\n(13 of 23), Page 13 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 13 of 23\nmeet the jurisdictional requirements in E. Bay and Washington. Because the Panel’s \ndecision conflicts with Ninth Circuit precedent, rehearing en banc is necessary to \nensure uniformity of the circuit court’s decisions. \nThe practical effect of the district court’s TRO, including compelling the \nexpenditure of federal funds, renders it functionally equivalent to a preliminary \ninjunction  and,  therefore,  appealable.  Where  a  TRO  has  the  same  effect  as  a \npreliminary  injunction,  it  is  appealable  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1292(a)(1).  E.  Bay \nSanctuary  Covenant  v.  Trump,  932  F.3d  742,  762–63  (9th  Cir.  2018)  (citing \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 86–88 (1974)). A TRO may be treated as a \npreliminary injunction “where an adversary hearing has been held, and the court’s \nbasis  for  issuing  the  order  [is]  strongly  challenged.”    Id.    (quoting  Bennett  v. \nMedtronic, Inc., 285 F.3d 801, 804 (9th Cir. 2002)).  The Supreme Court has further \ncautioned that a district court cannot “shield its orders from appellate review merely \nby designating them as [TROs], rather than as preliminary injunctions.”  Sampson, \n415 U.S. at 86–87.  \nFirst, Appellants had an opportunity to be heard here, and the district court \ndecided the TRO based on substantial briefing.  See E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant, 932 \nF.3d at 763 (citing the appealing party’s opportunity to brief and be heard as an \nimportant factor weighing in favor of appealability).  Appellees’ motion for a TRO \nbefore  the  district  court  expressly  requested  a  preliminary  injunction  as  an \nalternative to a TRO, demonstrating that Appellees believed their submission was \n12 \n \n\n(14 of 23), Page 14 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 14 of 23\nsufficient to sustain a preliminary injunction.  And Appellants filed a 21-page brief \nin opposition to Appellees’ motion, explaining why neither a TRO nor a preliminary \ninjunction was appropriate. The district court held a 90-minute adversary hearing \nwhere Appellants strongly challenged the district court’s basis for issuing the order, \nand issued an opinion that responded to both parties’ submissions and arguments. \nSecond, the district court’s TRO has the effect of a preliminary injunction.  \nSee Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 594 (2018) (holding that appellate jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) extends to orders that have the “practical effect” of \ngranting or denying an injunction, regardless of their label).  An order labeled as a \nTRO is appealable if it might have “serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence[s]” \nand can be “effectually challenged only by immediate appeal.”  Carson v. American \nBrands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also \nSampson, 415 U.S. at 86, n.58 (explaining that the reason for interlocutory appellate \nreview of preliminary injunctions, including those improperly labeled TROs, is “the \npossibility of drastic consequences which cannot later be corrected” (quoting Nat’l \nMediation Bd. v. Air Line Pilots Ass’n, 323 F.2d 305 (1963)).  \nThe  TRO  satisfies  these  criteria.    Appellants’  compliance  with  the  TRO \nmandates the federal government to expend taxpayer funds, directly impacting the \nU.S.  Treasury  and  interfering  with  the  Executive  Branch’s  discretionary \nadministration of those funds as allocated by Congress. Such compelled spending \nconstitutes a significant, ongoing intrusion, not merely the preservation of a status \n13 \n \n\n(15 of 23), Page 15 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 15 of 23\nquo.  Indeed, once disbursed, these funds may be difficult or impossible to recover, \ncausing  irreparable  financial  injury  to  the  government  and  frustrating  the \nExecutive’s discretionary determination as to the lawful use of such appropriations.  \nThis practical effect is characteristic of mandatory preliminary injunctive relief, not \na temporary restraint.  Indeed, it is precisely the type of order that the Supreme Court \nheld was an “appealable preliminary injunction” styled as a TRO in Dep’t of Educ., \n145 S.Ct. at 968 (order that “enjoin[ed] the government from terminating various \neducation-related grants” and “require[d] the Government to pay out past-due grant \nobligations  and  to  continue  paying  obligations  as  they  accrue”  was  properly \nconstrued as appealable preliminary injunction).  And because the district court \nrefused to impose any bond requirement, any moneys paid out under the TRO could \neasily be irrecoverable.  The TRO thus functions very much like an appealable \ninjunction. \nFinally, the TRO’s duration, within the 28-day limit in Rule 65(b), does not \nshield it from appellate review.  Without any “good cause” related to the alleged \nharm to Appellees, and days before the original TRO was set to expire, the district \ncourt extended the duration of the TRO to 28 days.  But as explained above, the \nnature of the order is akin to an appealable preliminary injunction, not an order \npreserving the status quo to allow the court to consider the merits of the parties’ \nclaims.  \n14 \n \n\n(16 of 23), Page 16 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 16 of 23\nII.  Rehearing  En  Banc  is  Warranted  Because  the  District  Court \nLacked Jurisdiction Under the APA and the Tucker Act. \nThe Panel’s decision denying Appellants’ appeal ignores the fact that the \nunderlying  TRO  suffers  from  fundamental  jurisdictional  defects,  an  issue  that \nindependently warrants this Court’s en banc review. The APA waives sovereign \nimmunity for claims seeking “relief other than money damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702 \n(emphasis added). This narrow waiver does not extend to suits that, although framed \nas seeking equitable relief, are in essence attempts to compel the payment of money \nor enforce contractual obligations. Plaintiffs seek an order forcing Defendants to \ncontinue providing funds under a partially terminated contract. This is a demand for \nspecific performance of a payment obligation—precisely the type of monetary relief \nfor which the APA does not waive immunity. The Supreme Court confirmed this \nprinciple  in Dep’t  of  Education,  stating  the  government  was  likely  to  succeed \nbecause the district court “lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under \nthe APA.” 145 S. Ct. at 968. The district court’s assertion of APA jurisdiction in \ncontravention of Dep’t of Education was therefore clear error; and such error was \nfurther  compounded  by  the  Panel’s  failure  to  acknowledge  and  reconcile  the \nSupreme Court’s intervening authority constraining the district court’s jurisdiction. \nFurthermore, the APA’s waiver does not apply if another statute “impliedly \nforbids  the  relief  which  is  sought.”  5  U.S.C.  §  702.  The  Tucker  Act,                                  \n28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), grants the Court of Federal Claims exclusive jurisdiction \n15 \n \n\n(17 of 23), Page 17 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 17 of 23\nover claims against the United States exceeding $10,000 founded upon “any Act of \nCongress or any regulation [ ], or upon any express or implied contract” mandating \npayment.  Id.  This  exclusive  jurisdiction  impliedly  forbids  district  courts  from \nadjudicating such contract-based claims, even when plaintiffs seek equitable relief \nlike specific performance or an injunction compelling payment. Plaintiffs’ claims \nhere are, indeed, “founded upon” the Acacia contract with DOI; their asserted right \nto funding exists only because of that contract and their subcontracts under it. And \nthey seek to compel continued performance (i.e., payment) under that contract: \nhallmarks of a quintessential Tucker Act claim. Plaintiffs cannot therefore escape \nthe Court of Federal Claims’ exclusive jurisdiction by styling their contract claim as \nan APA action.  \nIn its per curiam opinion, the Supreme Court in Dep’t of Education held that \nthe government was likely to succeed in showing that the district court lacked \njurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA. Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. \nCt. at 968. The Supreme Court stated that “the APA’s limited waiver of immunity \ndoes not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’” as the \ndistrict court had ordered the government to continue, and that “the Tucker Act \ngrants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over [such] suits.” Id. It therefore \nstayed the district court’s temporary restraining order; this Court should do the same \nhere. \n16 \n \n\n(18 of 23), Page 18 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 18 of 23\nIndeed, the Supreme Court’s ruling confirms that the Plaintiffs’ claims in this \ncase sound in contract because they are seeking payment, and thus belong in the \nCourt of Federal Claims. Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968 (“[T]he APA’s limited \nwaiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to \npay money[.]’”) (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. \n204, 212 (2002)).  What’s more, Plaintiffs seek to compel payment under specific \ncontractual instruments created and terminated in the agency’s discretion; indeed, \nthere  exists  no  statutory  obligation  compelling  the  provision  of  payment  for \nPlaintiffs’  legal  services.    While  the  district  court  determined  this  case  to  be \ndistinguishable from Dep’t of Education – because the district court here did not \n“require” past-due payments and because no contract exists between Plaintiffs and \nthe agencies – the district court’s analysis (and the Panel’s summary dismissal) elide \nthe facts in Dep’t of Education. There, the district court did not explicitly require the \ngovernment to pay past-due balances; rather, the district court in Dep’t of Education \nrequired the government to “restore the status quo,” and enjoined the government \nfrom terminating the grants. California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. CV 25-10548-\nMJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025). Past-due payments were \nsimply an effect of the order—just like the government will ultimately have to pay \npast-due  balances  pursuant  to  the  TRO  here,  even  though  the  TRO  does  not \nexplicitly require the government to make such payments.  \n17 \n \n\n(19 of 23), Page 19 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 19 of 23\nThe  Panel’s  conflict  with  binding  Supreme  Court  precedent  thus  further \nmilitates in favor of rehearing en banc.  \nIII.  Rehearing En Banc is Warranted Because the Questions at Issue \nare of Exceptional Importance.  \nThis case implicates issues far beyond the specific provision of payment for \nlegal services at issue here. Indeed, rehearing en banc is warranted here because the \nmatter concerns fundamental principles of sovereign immunity, Executive discretion \nover the public fisc, and the separation of powers.  \nFirst, the Panel’s summary dismissal undermines foundational separation of \npowers principles by permitting district courts to exercise jurisdiction over monetary \nclaims  against  the  United  States  in  contravention  of  the  Tucker  Act,  permits \nunreviewable  district  court  orders  to  compel  potentially  vast,  irrevocable \nexpenditures of taxpayer funds, and encroaches on the executive discretion over \nfiscal administration.  \nIn  Dep’t  of  Education,  the  Supreme  Court  acknowledged  the  irreparable \ninjury  to  the  government  from  the  dispersal  of  funds  that  are  unlikely  to  be \nrecovered, as well as the government’s significant interest in maintaining discretion \nover funding decisions. 145 S. Ct. at 969. Judicial interference with this discretion \nnot  only  disrupts  Executive  Branch  management  of  limited  resources  but  also \nundermines  the  public  interest  by  constraining  the  government’s  ability  to \neffectively  allocate  taxpayer  funds.  Given  the  clarity  of  the  Supreme  Court’s \n18 \n \n\n(20 of 23), Page 20 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 20 of 23\ninstruction, the district court’s analysis was thus legally flawed and an abuse of \ndiscretion. \nSecond,  the  district  court  also  abused  its  discretion  by  denying  the \ngovernment’s request for bond under Rule 65(c), as the district court essentially \nordered  the  government  to  pay  money  that  it  will  not  be  able  to  recover.  See \nDepartment of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coal., 145 S. Ct. 753, 753 (2025) \n(Alito,  J.,  dissenting)  (“Does  a  single  district-court  judge  who  likely  lacks \njurisdiction have the unchecked power to compel the Government of the United \nStates to pay out (and probably lose forever) millions in taxpayer dollars? The \nanswer to that question should be an emphatic ‘No[.]’”). If this decision stands, \nfederal district courts will continue exceeding their jurisdiction by ordering the \nExecutive Branch to restore lawfully terminated grants across the government, keep \npaying  for  programs  that  the  Executive  Branch  views  as  inconsistent  with  the \ninterests of the United States, and send out the door taxpayer money that may never \nbe clawed back. \nIndeed,  the  permanent  effects  of  the  TRO  are  all  the  more  apparent \nconsidering the district court’s refusal to set any bond—let alone bond high enough \nto allow the government to recoup the court-ordered expenditures.  ECF No. 33 at 7 \n(“The  Court  deems  no  security  bond  is  required  under  Rule  65(c).”).    That \ndetermination—which is alone an abuse of discretion sufficient to vacate the district \n19 \n \n\n(21 of 23), Page 21 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 21 of 23\ncourt’s order—ensures that the government will not be able to recoup the funds that \ngo out the door.  This order assuredly does not maintain the status quo.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For  the  reasons  stated,  this  Court  should  grant  Appellants’  Petition  for \nRehearing En Banc.  \n \n   \n20 \n \n\n(22 of 23), Page 22 of 23  Case: 25-2358, 04/23/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 22 of 23\nApril 23, 2025          Respectfully submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

Fletcher, Consuelo M. Callahan, and Lucy H. Koh, Circuit \nJudges. \nOrder by Judge Koh \nDissent by Judge Callahan \n \nKOH, Circuit Judge: \nTo protect unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings from the \nrisks of “mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking,” the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, directs that \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) “shall ensure, to the \ngreatest extent practicable,” that unaccompanied children in immigration custody \nreceive legal representation. Id. § 1232(c)(5). To carry out this obligation, the \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) promulgated the “Foundational Rule” \nwhich states that “ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide direct \nimmigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to \nORR’s discretion and available appropriations.” 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). Since \n2012, and as recently as March 15, 2025, Congress has consistently appropriated \nfunds to ensure compliance with the TVPRA’s statutory mandate. See Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, Div. A \nTit. I Sec. 1101(8), 139 Stat. 9, 11 (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664–665 (2024); \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Pub. L. 112-74, Div. F, Tit. II, 125 Stat. \n  2    \n\n(3 of 20), Page 3 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 3 of 20\n786, 1077 (2011); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169. In this matter, the district court \npreliminarily enjoined Defendants HHS, ORR and the Department of the Interior \n(“DOI”) (collectively, the “Government”) from withdrawing government-provided \nfunding for counsel to represent unaccompanied children in immigration \nproceedings. The Government appealed the issuance of the preliminary injunction \nand now moves to stay the injunction while this appeal is pending. \nWhen deciding a motion for a stay pending appeal, the court considers \n“(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a \nstay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.” Nken v. \nHolder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 \n(1987)). “The first two factors . . . are the most critical,” and the court will address \nthe last two factors only once the applicant has satisfied the first two factors. Id. at \n434–35. “The party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the \ncircumstances justify” issuance of the stay. Id. at 433–34.  \nWe conclude the Government has shown neither a likelihood of success on \nthe merits nor irreparable injury absent a stay and accordingly deny the \n  3    \n\n(4 of 20), Page 4 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 4 of 20\nGovernment’s motion.1 \nI.   \nThe Government offers two reasons why it believes it is likely to succeed on \nthe merits. First, the Government argues the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491, \n“impliedly forbids” plaintiffs’ Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims and \nthus the district court lacked jurisdiction. Second, the Government argues that its \ndecision to completely defund direct legal services for unaccompanied children \nconstitutes an unreviewable exercise of agency discretion. As explained below, the \nGovernment has not made “a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the \nmerits” of either argument. Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quoting Hilton, 481 U.S. at \n776). \nA.   \nThe APA “embodies [a] basic presumption of judicial review to one \n‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action.’” Abbott Lab’ys v. Gardner, 387 \nU.S. 136, 140–41 (1967) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702). The APA generally waives \nsovereign immunity and permits a challenge to agency action unless “any other \nstatute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is \n \n1   Because the Government failed to satisfy the first two stay factors, we need \nnot reach the two remaining stay factors. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 434–35. \n  4    \n\n(5 of 20), Page 5 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 5 of 20\nsought.” 5 U.S.C. § 702.2 The Government argues that the Tucker Act “impliedly \nforbids” plaintiffs’ suit because plaintiffs’ claims sound in contract and \naccordingly can only be brought in the Court of Federal Claims (if at all). This \nargument is unlikely to succeed for two reasons. \nFirst, contrary to the Government’s argument, plaintiffs’ APA claims are \nbased on the Government’s statutory and regulatory violations, not any \ngovernment contract. In fact, no contract exists between plaintiffs and the \nGovernment. Instead, the Government has entered into a nationwide agreement \nwith an organization called Acacia, who in turn subcontracts with legal service \nproviders such as plaintiffs. \n“[T]he Tucker Act . . . ‘impliedly forbid[s]’ an APA action seeking \ninjunctive and declaratory relief only if that action is a ‘disguised’ breach-of-\ncontract claim.” United Aeronautical Corp. v. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 \n(9th Cir. 2023) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. \n1982)). In making this determination, we “look[] to (1) ‘the source of the rights \nupon which the plaintiff bases its claims’ and (2) ‘the type of relief sought (or \nappropriate).’” Id. (quoting Doe v. Tenet, 329 F.3d 1135, 1141 (9th Cir. 2003)). \n \n2   The APA also does not apply to suits that either (a) seek “money damages,” \n5 U.S.C. § 702; or (b) where “other adequate remed[ies]” to review the agency \naction exist, id. § 704. On appeal, the Government does not argue that either of \nthese limitations on APA review apply here.   \n  5    \n\n(6 of 20), Page 6 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 6 of 20\n“If rights and remedies are statutorily or constitutionally based, then district \ncourts have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies are contractually based then only \nthe Court of Federal Claims does . . . .” Id. (emphasis in original); see also \nFerreiro v. United States, 501 F.3d 1349, 1353 n.3 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“An order \ncompelling the government to follow its regulations is equitable in nature and is \nbeyond the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.”). \nHere, plaintiffs seek to enforce compliance with statutes and regulations, not \nany government contract. The TVPRA provides that the Government “shall \nensure, to the greatest extent practicable . . . that all unaccompanied alien \nchildren . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and \nprotect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added). The Foundational Rule states that “ORR shall fund \nlegal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for \ncertain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available \nappropriations.” 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added). Seeking to ensure \ncompliance with statutory and regulatory commands is a matter beyond the scope \nof the Tucker Act’s exclusive jurisdiction.  \nIn evaluating the merits, the district court found plaintiffs were likely to \nsucceed in showing a violation of both of these provisions. Congress has \nappropriated substantial funds specifically to carry out the TVPRA for over a \n  6    \n\n(7 of 20), Page 7 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 7 of 20\ndecade and as recently as 2025. See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and \nExtensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8), 139 Stat. 9, \n11 (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D \nTit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664–665 (2024). The district court found that the Government \nelected to withhold all congressionally authorized funding for direct legal \nrepresentation, even though such funding was necessary to ensure all \nunaccompanied children remained represented. It was “undisputed that \nappropriations for direct representation remain available,” and that the Government \nhad “evidenced no effort to ensure pro bono counsel.” Indeed, the district court \nfound the Government made its decision “with no supplemental plan to ensure \nunaccompanied children have legal counsel” at all, let alone “to the greatest extent \npracticable.” On appeal, the Government contests the district court’s jurisdiction \nbut does not dispute any of the aforementioned findings. Plaintiffs accordingly are \nlikely to establish the requisite violations of law to support their APA claims \nirrespective of any contractual violation. \nSecond, as the Government concedes, subcontractors such as plaintiffs do \nnot even have the right to sue under the Tucker Act. The Tucker Act provides the \nCourt of Federal Claims with jurisdiction to hear claims based “upon any express \nor implied contract with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). Consistent \nwith the statute’s plain text, “[t]o maintain a cause of action pursuant to the Tucker \n  7    \n\n(8 of 20), Page 8 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 8 of 20\nAct that is based on a contract, the contract must be between the plaintiff and the \ngovernment.” Cienega Gardens v. United States, 194 F.3d 1231, 1239 (Fed. Cir. \n1998) (quoting Ransom v. United States, 900 F.2d 242, 244 (Fed. Cir. 1990)). \nSubcontractors, who have not entered into contracts with the Government, \ngenerally have no right to sue under the Tucker Act, and the Court of Federal \nClaims has no jurisdiction to hear their suit. See id.; Erickson Air Crane Co. of \nWash., Inc. v. United States, 731 F.2d 810, 813 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  \nThe Government concedes (and indeed affirmatively argues) that the Court \nof Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ claims because “it is ‘a \nhornbook rule that, under ordinary government prime contracts, subcontractors do \nnot have standing to sue the government under the Tucker Act.’” But the \nGovernment nonetheless argues the Tucker Act “impliedly forbids” plaintiffs’ \nAPA claims because “subcontractors have fewer legal rights than prime \ncontractors.” This argument lacks merit.  \nThe Tucker Act’s “exclusive jurisdiction” has been construed “to impliedly \nforbid contract claims against the Government from being brought in district court \nunder the waiver in the APA.” Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 \nF.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (cleaned up) (quoting Perry Cap. LLC v. \nMnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 618–19 (D.C. Cir. 2017)). But “[t]here cannot be \nexclusive jurisdiction under the Tucker Act if there is no jurisdiction under the \n  8    \n\n(9 of 20), Page 9 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 9 of 20\nTucker Act.” Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 177 (D.C. Cir. 2006). For this \nreason, the D.C. Circuit has “categorically reject[ed] the suggestion that a federal \ndistrict court can be deprived of jurisdiction by the Tucker Act when no \njurisdiction lies in the Court of Federal Claims.” Id. at 176; see also Crowley, 38 \nF.4th at 1109 (“Because a plaintiff could not bring this type of tort action in [the \nCourt of Federal Claims] in the first place, that Court would not have exclusive \njurisdiction of them.”). \nThe result requested by the Government would mean that no court has \njurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ claims. Not only is this result contrary to common \nsense, but it also conflicts with the “strong presumption favoring judicial review of \nadministrative action” that is embodied in the APA. Mach Mining, LLC v. \nE.E.O.C., 575 U.S. 480, 486 (2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see Abbott \nLab’ys, 387 U.S. at 140–41. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Department of Education v. \nCalifornia, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), does not change this conclusion. Department of \nEducation involved a claim to enforce grant agreements that the plaintiffs had \nentered into directly with the government and thus “to enforce a contractual \nobligation to pay money.” Id. at 968 (citation omitted). The Supreme Court held \nthat this claim fell within the Tucker Act’s grant of exclusive jurisdiction and \naccordingly suggested that the suit must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. \n  9    \n\n(10 of 20), Page 10 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 10 of 20\nSee id. (“But, as we have recognized, the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does \nnot extend to orders to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money along the \nlines of what the District Court ordered here. Instead, the Tucker Act grants the \nCourt of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on any express or implied \ncontract with the United States.” (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). \nDepartment of Education has no application where, as here, the claims sound in \nstatute, rather than contract. \nAccordingly, the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on its \nTucker Act argument. \nB.  \nThe APA does not apply where “agency action is committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). This exception has been construed \n“narrowly” to apply only in “those rare circumstances where the relevant statute is \ndrawn so that a court would have no meaningful standard against which to judge \nthe agency’s exercise of discretion.” Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. Fish & Wildlife \nServ., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018) (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993)). \nThe Supreme Court has identified certain categories of agency decisions that have \ntraditionally been regarded as committed to agency discretion and are, accordingly, \n“presumptively unreviewable.” Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832–33 (1985) \n(holding agency decision whether to initiate an enforcement action was \n  10    \n\n(11 of 20), Page 11 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 11 of 20\npresumptively unreviewable). Even where an action falls within the class of \nactions traditionally committed to agency discretion, “judicial review is available \nwhere there are ‘meaningful standards to cabin the agency’s otherwise plenary \ndiscretion.’” Physicians for Soc. Resp. v. Wheeler, 956 F.3d 634, 643 (D.C. Cir. \n2020) (quoting Drake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, 71 (D.C. Cir. 2002)).  \nThe Government argues that the decision to cancel the program is committed \nto agency discretion by law. Its argument is based entirely upon the Supreme \nCourt’s decision in Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993). In that case, the Indian \nHealth Service (the “Service”) was provided with a single lump-sum appropriation \nthat covered all of the agency’s activities. Id. at 185. The Service was authorized, \nbut not required, to “‘expend such moneys as Congress may from time to time \nappropriate, for the benefit, care, and assistance of the Indians,’ for the ‘relief of \ndistress and conservation of health,’” including on “Indian mental-health care.” Id. \nat 184 (quoting 25 U.S.C. § 13). The Service had historically exercised this \ndiscretion to establish the “Indian Children’s Program,” which provided a variety \nof medical services to Indian children, but subsequently decided to cancel that \nprogram. Id. at 184–85. Plaintiffs brought an APA claim challenging the Service’s \ndecision not to fund the program. Id. \nThe Supreme Court held that the Service’s “allocation of funds from a lump-\nsum appropriation is [a type of] administrative decision traditionally regarded as \n  11    \n\n(12 of 20), Page 12 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 12 of 20\ncommitted to agency discretion” and was, accordingly, presumptively \nunreviewable. Id. at 192. The Court explained that “allocation of funds from a \nlump-sum appropriation requires ‘a complicated balancing of a number of factors \nwhich are peculiarly within [agency] expertise.’” Id. at 193 (quoting Heckler, 470 \nU.S. at 831). Because the relevant statutes did “not so much as mention the \nProgram” that was cancelled, let alone require it, the Court found “[t]he decision to \nterminate the Program was committed to the Service’s discretion” by law. Id. at \n193–94. \nThe rule announced in Lincoln has no application where, as here, the agency \nfails to carry out a program that is required by statute. Lincoln made clear that “an \nagency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities” and “Congress \nmay always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting \nrestrictions in the operative statutes.” Id. at 193; see also Los Coyotes Band of \nCahuilla & Cupeno Indians v. Jewell, 729 F.3d 1025, 1038 (9th Cir. 2013) (noting \nthat Lincoln applies only “absent some statutory constraint on the agency’s \ndiscretion”). Where Congress establishes a mandatory program, in the sense that \n“Congress directs (rather than merely authorizes) the agency to conduct” certain \nactivities, the rule in Lincoln has no application.

(“When Congress appropriates \nmoney to implement a program, and implementation of the program is mandatory, \nthe agency may not use the appropriated amounts to terminate the program.”); see, \ne.g., Shawnee Tribe v. Mnuchin, 984 F.3d 94, 100 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (explaining that \nwhere “Congress has ‘circumscribe[d] agency discretion to allocate resources by \nputting restrictions in the operative statute[]’” there is “no presumption of non-\nreviewability” (quoting Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193)); Ramah Navajo Sch. Bd. v. \nBabbitt, 87 F.3d 1338, 1347 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (distinguishing Lincoln where \n“Congress intended the [statute] to limit the Secretary’s discretion in funding \nmatters”). Rather, in such circumstances the Executive has no authority to withhold \nthe funds appropriated by Congress or otherwise refuse to comply with the law. \nSee City & Cnty. of San Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1232 (9th Cir. 2018) \n(“Aside from the power of veto, the President is without authority to thwart \ncongressional will by canceling appropriations passed by Congress.”); In re Aiken \nCnty., 725 F.3d 255, 266 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.) (“Prosecutorial \ndiscretion does not include the power to disregard other statutory obligations that \napply to the Executive Branch, such as statutory requirements to issue rules, or to \npay benefits, or to implement or administer statutory projects or programs.” \n(internal citation omitted)); see also Memorandum from William H. Rehnquist, \nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to Edward L. Morgan, \n  13    \n\n(14 of 20), Page 14 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 14 of 20\nDeputy Counsel to the President (Dec. 1, 1969) (“While there have been instances \nin the past in which the President has refused to spend funds appropriated by \nCongress for a particular purpose, we know of no such instance involving a statute \nwhich by its terms sought to require such expenditure.”).  \nHere, the TVPRA provides that HHS “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \npracticable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to \nrepresent them in legal proceedings.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added); see \nalso id. § 1232(c)(1) (HHS “shall establish policies and programs to ensure that \nunaccompanied alien children in the United States are protected from traffickers” \n(emphasis added)). This statute does not say that HHS “may” provide certain \nservices, as was the case in Lincoln. Instead, the use of “shall” plainly imposes a \nmandatory duty on HHS to take steps to ensure “all” such children have counsel. \nSee Alabama v. Bozeman, 533 U.S. 146, 153 (2001) (“The word ‘shall’ is \nordinarily the language of command.” (internal quotation marks and citation \nomitted)). Similarly, the Foundational Rule states that “ORR shall fund legal \nservice providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available \nappropriations.” 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added). These affirmative \nobligations stand in stark contrast with those at issue in Lincoln, where “no statute \nor regulation even mention[ed] the Program” that was cancelled, let alone required \n  14    \n\n(15 of 20), Page 15 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 15 of 20\nthat the Executive carry out the program. 508 U.S. at 190.  \nTo be sure, HHS is only required to provide counsel “to the greatest extent \npracticable” and the Foundational Rule similarly grants the agency some discretion \nin the procurement of counsel for unaccompanied children, but that in no way \ndefeats judicial review. Whatever discretion the agency may have in evaluating \nwhat “the greatest extent practicable” may be, this phrase certainly is not the same \nas “to no extent at all.” See Calvert Cliffs’ Coordinating Comm., Inc. v. U. S. \nAtomic Energy Comm’n, 449 F.2d 1109, 1114 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (explaining that the \nfact the agencies’ statutory duties were “qualified by the phrase ‘to the fullest \nextent possible’” did “not provide an escape hatch for footdragging agencies” and \ndid “not make [the statute’s] requirements somehow ‘discretionary’”). APA \nSection 701(a)(2) has “never been thought to put all exercises of discretion beyond \njudicial review.” ASSE Int’l, Inc. v. Kerry, 803 F.3d 1059, 1071 (9th Cir. 2015). To \nthe contrary, “the APA itself commits final agency action to [judicial] review for \n‘abuse of discretion.’” Pinnacle Armor, Inc. v. United States, 648 F.3d 708, 720 \n(9th Cir. 2011) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(2)(A)). Review is prohibited only where \n“there is truly no law to apply.” Jajati v. U.S. Customs & Border Prot., 102 F.4th \n1011, 1014 (9th Cir. 2024) (quoting Perez Perez v. Wolf, 943 F.3d 853, 861 (9th \nCir. 2019)). And courts routinely find far less determinate language than that at \nissue here establishes a sufficient standard to permit review. See, e.g., Citizens to \n  15    \n\n(16 of 20), Page 16 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 16 of 20\nPres. Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 411 (1971) (determination \nwhether “no feasible and prudent alternative” existed was reviewable); Pac. Nw. \nGenerating Coop. v. Bonneville Power Admin., 596 F.3d 1065, 1075 (9th Cir. \n2010) (requirement that agency act “consistent with sound business principles” \nprovided meaningful standard for review); City of Los Angeles v. U.S. Dep’t of \nCom., 307 F.3d 859, 869 n.6 (9th Cir. 2002) (requirement that an agency Secretary \n“shall” act “if he considers it feasible” provided a meaningful standard for review). \nAccordingly, the Government has not shown a likelihood of success on this \nargument either.  \nII.    \nAn applicant for a stay pending appeal must show that a stay is necessary to \navoid likely irreparable injury to the applicant while the appeal is pending. See \nNken, 556 U.S. at 434. “[S]imply showing some possibility of irreparable injury” is \ninsufficient. Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Rather, “[t]he minimum \nthreshold showing for a stay pending appeal requires that irreparable injury is \nlikely to occur during the period before the appeal is likely to be decided.” Al Otro \nLado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1007 (9th Cir. 2020) (citing Leiva-Perez v. Holder, \n640 F.3d 962, 968 (9th Cir. 2011)).  \nThe Government has not met its irreparable injury burden. Despite waiting \nnearly a week to file this emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction, the \n  16    \n\n(17 of 20), Page 17 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 17 of 20\nGovernment provides no evidence to support its claims of irreparable injury. Cf. Al \nOtro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1007 (rejecting “a weak showing” of harm where the \ngovernment had the opportunity to gather evidence in support of its claims). \nRather, the Government asserts evidence is unnecessary in this case because the \ninjunction requires the disbursement of taxpayer funds that may never be \nrecovered, and the injunction harms the separation of powers. We disagree. \nFirst, the Government has made no showing that dispersing congressionally \nappropriated funds for statutorily mandated purposes would cause irreparable harm \nin this case. Since 2012, and as recently as March 15, 2025, Congress has \nconsistently appropriated funds to ensure compliance with the TVPRA’s statutory \nmandate. See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, \n2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8), 139 Stat. 9, 11 (2025); Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. \n460, 664–665 (2024); Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, Pub. L. 112-74, \nDiv. F, Tit. II, 125 Stat. 786, 1077 (2011); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169. These funds are \nstatutorily earmarked to carryout the TVPRA. Pursuant to the TVPRA, HHS “shall \nensure, to the greatest extent practical . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . \n. have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them \nfrom mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). The \nPresident is required to spend these funds for the purpose of carrying out the \n  17    \n\n(18 of 20), Page 18 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 18 of 20\nTVPRA and only for that purpose. See 31 U.S.C. § 1301(a) (“Appropriations shall \nbe applied only to the objects for which the appropriations were made except as \notherwise provided by law.”); City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1232 \n(“[T]he President does not have unilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.” \n(quoting Aiken, 725 F.3d at 261 n.1)). The district court concluded that the \nGovernment is likely now shirking a statutory obligation that has been in place for \nover a decade. The Government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that \nmerely ends an unlawful practice.” Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 \n(9th Cir. 2013). The Government has failed to demonstrate that spending \ncongressionally appropriated funds as directed by Congress causes irreparable \ninjury. \nThe Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education is not to the \ncontrary. In assessing the risks of injury to the government there, the Supreme \nCourt relied upon a declaration from a government official asserting the difficulties \ninherent in recovering disbursed funds under the specific grant agreements in that \ncase. See 145 S. Ct. at 969 (citing App. To Application To Vacate Order 15a, \n17a.). No such evidence has been presented here. To the contrary, the \nGovernment’s motion fails to cite any evidence at all. Absent any showing from \nthe Government, we cannot conclude that irreparable injury “is the more probable \nor likely outcome” here. Al Otro Lado, 952 F.3d at 1007 (quoting Leiva-Perez, 640 \n  18    \n\n(19 of 20), Page 19 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 19 of 20\nF.3d at 968). \nSecond, we reject the notion that the injunction’s effect on the “separation of \npowers” qualifies as irreparable harm at the stay stage. See Washington v. Trump, \n847 F.3d 1151, 1168 (9th Cir. 2017) (“To the extent that the Government claims \nthat it has suffered an institutional injury by erosion of the separation of powers, \nthat injury is not ‘irreparable.’ It may yet pursue and vindicate its interests in the \nfull course of this litigation.”); see also E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump, 932 \nF.3d 742, 778 (9th Cir. 2018) (finding a separation of powers argument inadequate \nto demonstrate irreparable harm). In denying a motion to stay in another case, we \nconcluded that the government had not established irreparable harm because “if we \nwere to adopt the government’s assertion that the irreparable harm standard is \nsatisfied by the fact of executive action alone, no act of the executive branch \nasserted to be inconsistent with a legislative enactment could be the subject of a \npreliminary injunction. That cannot be so.” Doe #1 v. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1059 \n(9th Cir. 2020). The Government does not acknowledge this line of precedent, \nmuch less attempt to distinguish it. \nIII.    \nFor the reasons set forth above, we deny the Government’s request for a stay \npending appeal.  \n  19    \n\n(20 of 20), Page 20 of 20  Case: 25-2808, 05/14/2025, DktEntry: 17.1, Page 20 of 20\nFILED\n \nCommunity Legal Services in East Palo Alto, et al. v. United States Department of  \nHealth and Human Services, et al., No. 25-2808  MAY 14 2025 \n \n \nMOLLY C. DWYER, CLERK \nCALLAHAN, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  U.S. COURT OF APPEALS \n \nFor the reasons provided in the dissent from rehearing en banc that I joined \nin the prior appeal in this case, I respectfully dissent.  See Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. \nPalo Alto v. United States Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., No. 25-2358, --- F.4th --\n--, ----, 2025 WL 1203167, at *3-4 (9th Cir. Apr. 25, 2025) (Bumatay, J., and \nVanDyke, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).  Even if the district \ncourt had jurisdiction under the Administrative Procedure Act, the decision to \nterminate funding—or the decision of who to fund—is committed to agency \ndiscretion by law under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) \n(qualifying the provision of legal services “to the greatest extent practicable”).  I \nwould therefore grant the government’s stay motion. \n \n ",

The matter is fully briefed and \nee 17 \ntinhtr suitable for decision without oral argument.  Accordingly, the hearing set for May 15, 2025, is \nUo\nN 18 \nVACATED.  See Civil L.R. 7-1(b), Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 78(b).  Having read the papers filed by the \n19 \nparties and carefully considered their arguments therein, as well as the relevant legal authority, I \n20 \nhereby DENY the motion for recusal for the following reasons. \n21 \nI.  BACKGROUND \n22 \nThis lawsuit seeking relief under the Administrative Procedure Act related to the \n23 \nGovernment’s termination of funding allocated to legal services for unaccompanied children in \n24 \nimmigration proceedings was filed by on March 26, 2025, by 11 non-governmental organizations.  \n25 \nSee Compl. (ECF 1).  The Plaintiffs are Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Social \n26 \nJustice Collaborative, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Estrella del Paso, Florence Immigrant \n27 \nand Refugee Rights Project, Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, Immigrant \n28 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 2 of 9\n \n1  Defenders Law Center, National Immigrant Justice Center, Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, \n2  Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, and Vermont Asylum Assistance Project \n3  (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  They are represented by counsel from Immigrant Defenders Law \n4  Center, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, and Justice Action Center.  See id.   \n5  On March 27, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and \n6  preliminary injunction (ECF 7), and the case was assigned to me (ECF 10).1  Later that day, I \n7  issued an order setting a hearing, as well as a deadline for the Government’s written response to \n8  Plaintiffs’ TRO motion, and ordering service of the order on the Government.  ECF 17.  On March \n9  31, 2025, in accordance with the schedule set on March 27, the Government filed its opposition to \n10  Plaintiffs’ motion.  See ECF 24.  On April 1, 2025, the parties appeared for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ \n11  motion.  ECF 30.  After taking the matter under submission, I issued an order granting Plaintiffs’ \n12  motion, issuing a TRO, and setting an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs’ request for a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  preliminary injunction.  ECF 33. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  The parties have continued to litigate the case since I granted the TRO.  The motions now \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  pending include Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction (ECF 37), the Government’s motion \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  to dissolve the TRO (ECF 38), and Plaintiffs’ two motions to enforce the TRO (ECF 40, ECF 53).  \nS d nr\nee 17  In the midst of this briefing, the Government filed a motion for recusal of a district judge pursuant \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to Title 28 U.S.C. § 455, the motion that is the subject of this Order.  See ECF 47.  Disinclined to \n19  issue further orders in the case while my impartiality was under question, I issued an order \n20  expediting briefing and extending the TRO to allow time to resolve the motion to recuse.  See ECF \n21  48.2  The Government has since submitted an amended motion with a notice of errata.  See ECF \n22  59, Attach. A (“Mot.”). \n23 \n \n24 \n1 Though it is my usual practice to issue orders in the third-person as a member of “the Court,” \nthis Order issues largely in the first-person in observance of a self-reflective and fact-driven \n25 \nanalysis that is “ ‘guided, not by comparison to similar situations addressed by prior jurisprudence, \nbut rather by an independent examination of the unique facts and circumstances of the particular \n26 \nclaim at issue.’ ”  United States v. Holland, 519 F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 2008) (quoting United \nStates v. Bremers, 195 F.3d 221, 226 (5th Cir. 1999)). \n27 \n \n2 The Government has since appealed the TRO and moved to stay enforcement of the TRO.  See \n28 \nECF 56, ECF 57. \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 3 of 9\n \n1  II.  DISCUSSION \n2  The Government moves for recusal pursuant to Title 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).3  The standard for \n3  recusal under this statute requires an assessment of “[w]hether a reasonable person with \n4  knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be \n5  questioned.”  United States v. Hernandez, 109 F.3d 1450, 1453 (9th Cir. 1997); see also Liljeberg \n6  v. Health Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 861 (1988).  The “reasonable person” is not \n7  “hypersensitive or unduly suspicious,” and “is not a ‘partly informed man-in-the-street[.]’ ”  \n8  United States v. Holland, 519 F.3d 909, 913-14 (9th Cir. 2008); see also Blixseth v. Yellowstone \n9  Mountain Club, LLC, 742 F.3d 1215, 1219 (9th Cir. 2014).  Rather, the reasonable person is a \n10  “well-informed, thoughtful observer[,]” and is “someone who ‘understand[s] all the relevant facts’ \n11  and has examined the record and the law.”  Holland, 519 F.3d at 913-14 (citation omitted).  The \n12  Ninth Circuit has cautioned against construing the recusal statute “so broadly . . . that it becomes, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  in effect, presumptive” upon the “merest unsubstantiated suggestion of personal bias or prejudice.”   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Id. at 913 (citations omitted).  Indeed, while recusal may be required by the law and facts of a \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  case, judges “must not simply recuse out of an abundance of caution when the recusal is not \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  appropriate.”  United States v. Sierra Pac. Indus., 759 F. Supp. 2d 1198, 1201 (E.D. Cal. 2010) \nS d nr\nee 17  (citing Holland, 519 F.3d at 912).  Importantly, the standard for recusal is a high one – “[s]ince a \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  federal judge is presumed to be impartial, the party seeking disqualification bears a substantial \n19  burden to show that the judge is biased.”  Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 790 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1129 \n20  (N.D. Cal. 2011) (citation omitted). \n21  The Government seeks recusal under two theories: (A) the appearance of bias in favor of \n22  Plaintiffs and (B) a presumption of personal knowledge regarding underlying facts.  I address \n23 \n24 \n \n3 The Government states early in its motion that part of its purpose in seeking my recusal is “to \n25 \nhalt the inappropriate infringements into President Trump’s exercises of Executive Power.”  Mot. \nat 1.  As Judge Beryl A. Howell opined in response to a similar excerpt in a motion seeking to \n26 \nrecuse her, “This line, which sounds like a talking point from a member of Congress rather than a \nlegal brief from the United States Department of Justice, has no citation to any legal authority for \n27 \nthe simple reason that the notion expressed reflects a grave misapprehension of our constitutional \norder.”  Perkins Coie LLP v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., No. CV 25-716 (BAH), 2025 WL 914099, at *1 \n28 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 26, 2025). \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 4 of 9\n \n1  these two theories in turn.  Although the parties additionally dispute the timeliness of the recusal \n2  motion, I do not reach that argument because I deny the motion on the merits. \n3  A.  Appearance of Bias \n4  The Government argues that there is an appearance of bias toward Plaintiffs in this case \n5  because I previously worked as a managing attorney at Plaintiff Community Legal Services in \n6  East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”).  The Government argued in its initial motion that “there is at least an \n7  objective appearance of impartiality given that [my] most recent former employer [National \n8  Immigration Law Center (“NILC”)] is representing Plaintiffs in this case.”  ECF 47 at 5.  The \n9  Government omits this contention from the amended motion and appear to abandon it.  Cf. Mot. \n10  (ECF 59).  However, to be clear, NILC does not appear in this case, neither as counsel nor as a \n11  party.  Any argument of partiality based on my former employment at NILC and its participation \n12  in this case is unfounded and does not warrant my recusal. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Government avers that my employment history would lead a reasonable person to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  conclude that my impartiality might be questioned, referring to my experience as a staff attorney \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and managing attorney at CLSEPA.  See Mot. at 3 (citing Araceli Martínez-Olguín, Questionnaire \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  for Judicial Nominees, at 24, https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Martínez-\nS d nr\nee 17  Olguín%20SJQ%20Public%20Final.pdf).  Federal judges regularly deny recusal motions where \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  the judge’s prior employment had an arguable relationship to the issues presented in the case \n19  before them.  See, e.g., Jackson v. Tesla, Inc., No. 22-CV-04380-PCP, 2025 WL 901009, at *4 \n20  (N.D. Cal. Mar. 25, 2025) (citing In Philip Morris USA Inc. v. U.S. Food & Drug Admin., 156 F. \n21  Supp. 3d 36 (D.D.C. 2016)).  The touchpoint for recusal in matters involving a judge’s former \n22  legal employer frequently requires interrogating whether the judge was involved in the particular \n23  litigation as an advocate prior to taking the bench, not whether the judge generally worked for the \n24  legal employer or practiced in a given area of law.  See id.  Compare, for example, Section \n25  455(b)(3)’s requirement for recusal when a judge “has served in governmental employment and in \n26  such capacity participated as counsel, adviser or material witness concerning the proceeding or \n27  expressed an opinion concerning the merits of the particular case in controversy.”  28 U.S.C. \n28  § 455(b)(3). \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 5 of 9\n \n1  A jurist’s prior employment alone does not establish a circumstance in which their \n2  “impartiality might reasonably be questioned” pursuant to Section 455(a).  See United States v. \n3  Champlin, 388 F. Supp. 2d 1177, 1183-84 (D. Haw. 2005) (finding that judge’s prior employment \n4  as an Assistant U.S. Attorney did not give rise to reasonable questions regarding the court’s \n5  impartiality).  Moreover, it has been nearly seven years since I left CLSEPA, including over two \n6  years on the bench, a period of time that attenuates and undercuts any risk of improper influence.  \n7  This period of separation undermines relying on my employment history as a basis for recusal.  Cf. \n8  United States v. Barajas-Bandt, No. 10CR82-BTM, 2011 WL 742713, at *3 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 24, \n9  2011) (noting that the United States Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Codes of \n10  Conduct “recommends that judges consider a recusal period of at least two years, recognizing that \n11  there will be circumstances where a longer period may be more appropriate” in circumstances \n12  where a former law partner appears as counsel before a judge) (citing 2 Guide to Judiciary Policies \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  and Procedures, Ch. 2 at 24-1 (Advisory Opinion No. 24)).  Most importantly, the Government \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  fails to identify any matter connected to my work at CLSEPA that would bear upon the issues \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  presented here.  I did not work as a lawyer or supervise lawyers regarding this matter; nor could I \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  have worked on this litigation, given that the facts underlying this case only transpired in the past \nS d nr\nee 17  several weeks.  See Compl. ¶ 11 (alleging termination and “Cancellation Order” issued March 21, \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  2025).  Section 455(a) does not require my recusal based on my prior CLSEPA employment. \n19  The Government also argues that my “relationship with the attorneys representing \n20  Plaintiffs in this case” requires recusal.  See Mot. at 5.  It contends that my connections two \n21  attorneys representing Plaintiffs in this matter, Karen Tumlin and Esther Sung, weigh in favor of \n22  recusal.  Specifically, the Government cites two instances where I served as co-counsel with Ms. \n23  Tumlin before joining the bench, and they cite my prior employment at NILC, where Ms. Sung \n24  also once worked.  Id. at 5-6.  To be clear, Ms. Sung and I worked at NILC at different times and \n25  have no relationship.  Additionally, though the Government does not raise it, I note that Alvaro \n26  Huerta, another of Plaintiffs’ counsel, and I worked together at NILC from November 2018, when \n27  I started at NILC, to January 2022, when Mr. Huerta left NILC.  In any case, the existence of a \n28  professional or even a personal relationship does not present grounds for recusal under Section \n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 6 of 9\n \n1  455(a).  As multiple courts have recognized, “In today’s legal culture friendships among judges \n2  and lawyers are common.  They are more than common; they are desirable.  A judge need not cut \n3  [themself] off from the rest of the legal community. . . .  Many courts therefore have held that a \n4  judge need not disqualify [themself] just because a friend – even a close friend – appears as a \n5  lawyer.”  Philip Morris USA Inc. v. United States Food & Drug Admin., 156 F. Supp. 3d 36, 53 \n6  (D.D.C. 2016) (quoting United States v. Murphy, 768 F.2d 1518, 1537 (7th Cir.1985)).  Indeed, in \n7  Philip Morris USA, the district court denied recusal in a case litigated by a law firm where he had \n8  previously worked and where his wife served as a partner – two closer relational connections than \n9  the friendly co-counsel relationship at issue between me and Ms. Tumlin or of co-workers \n10  between me and Mr. Huerta.  See Philip Morris USA, 156 F. Supp. 3d at 51-53.  Accordingly, my \n11  pre-existing relationships with Ms. Tumlin and Mr. Huerta do not require my recusal.  \n12  The Government separately argues that my public comments related to some of the first \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Trump Administration’s immigration policies “would give a reasonable person pause as to \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  whether [I] can be impartial.”  Mot. at 5.  However, the Government cites no authority suggesting \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  that facts that may give a person “pause” regarding impartiality warrants recusal.  To the contrary, \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the correct standard is whether “a reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would \nS d nr\nee 17  conclude that the judge’s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.”  Hernandez, 109 F.3d at \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  1453.  Nor does the Government offer any authority in support of the premise that comments \n19  made prior to a judge’s appointment to the bench can support a showing of bias necessitating \n20  recusal.  This is perhaps not surprising since caselaw dictates that the “reasonable person” is not \n21  “hypersensitive or unduly suspicious,” and “is not a ‘partly informed man-in-the-street[.]’ ”  \n22  Holland, 519 F.3d at 913-14.  Indeed, courts have long recognized that “[a]ll judges come to the \n23  bench with a background of experiences, associations and viewpoints.  This background alone is \n24  seldom sufficient in itself to provide a reasonable basis for recusal.”  Brody v. President & \n25  Fellows of Harvard Coll., 664 F.2d 10, 11 (1st Cir. 1981).  The years-old comments excerpted by \n26  the Government fall short of leading a reasonable person to conclude that my impartiality might be \n27  questioned.  Indeed, the well-informed person presented with the facts of this case would \n28  understand the distinction between, on the one hand, the zealous advocacy with which I was \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 7 of 9\n \n1  obligated to represent my clients as an attorney (see ABA Model Rules of Pro. Conduct r. 1.3) \n2  and, on the other hand, the faithful and impartial administration of justice I vowed to provide all \n3  parties before me as a judge of the United States (see 28 U.S.C. § 453). \n4  The Government repeatedly advances that a totality of circumstances review of the \n5  purported bases for my recusal would lead a reasonable person to conclude that my impartiality \n6  could be reasonably questioned.  See, e.g., Reply (ECF 68) at 5-6 (citing Holland, 519 F.3d at \n7  913).  However, the Government’s reasoning ignores the full record in favor of a selective review \n8  of the relevant facts.  A “reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts” – my several-year \n9  separation from CLSEPA, my former relationships with Ms. Tumlin and Mr. Huerta, my duty as \n10  an advocate to zealously represent my clients, the statements I made as an advocate unrelated to \n11  the facts and law of this case, the oath I swore to impartially administer justice as a judge – would \n12  not conclude that my impartiality might reasonably be questioned.  See Hernandez, 109 F.3d at \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  1453.  As the Government acknowledges, the assessment for disqualification under Section 455(a) \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  is “necessarily fact-driven and may turn on subtleties in the particular case.”  Reply at 7 (quoting \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Holland, 519 F.3d at 913).  The relevant subtleties here require distinguishing between my prior \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  work and the comments I made as an advocate regarding the first Trump Administration’s policies \nS d nr\nee 17  toward holders of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (“DACA”) versus the issues presented \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  here, an Administrative Procedure Act challenge to termination of funding for counsel \n19  representing unaccompanied children in immigration court.     \n20  Ultimately, the Government’s “fanciful theory of bias cannot ‘overcome [the] presumption \n21  of honesty and integrity in those serving as adjudicators.’ ”  Martinez v. Ryan, 926 F.3d 1215, \n22  1227 (9th Cir. 2019) (alteration in original, citation omitted).  Nothing in my prior experiences as \n23  an attorney would cause a reasonable, well-informed observer to doubt my ability to adjudicate the \n24  case before me fairly and impartially.  See Coalition for Econ. Equity v. Wilson, Case No. 96-cv-\n25  4024-TEH, ECF 200, at 4-5 (N.D. Cal. Dec. 20, 1996) (noting that a judge’s prior experience \n26  litigating civil rights cases does not require their recusal from civil rights cases that may later \n27  come before that jurist) (citing Brody, 664 F.2d at 11). \n28  For all of these reasons, I deny the motion for recusal under Section 455(a). \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 8 of 9\n \n1  B.  Personal Knowledge of Underlying Facts \n2  The Government additionally argues for recusal based on my employment history as a \n3  former managing attorney at CLSEPA under an alternate theory – that such experience necessarily \n4  gives rise to personal knowledge of the organization’s budget and operations.  See Mot. at 6 \n5  (citing 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1)).  Under Title 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1), a judge shall recuse where they \n6  have “personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceeding.”  This \n7  subjective and “highly personal” test requires the judge “to set aside emotion and thoughtfully \n8  examine [their] ability to impartially ‘administer justice without respect to persons.’ ”  Holland, \n9  519 F.3d at 915 (citing 28 U.S.C. § 453).  While Section 455(a) addresses the “appearance” of a \n10  conflict of interest, whether or not such a conflict actually exists, Section 455(b) “is a per se rule \n11  and covers acts that actually create a conflict even if there is no appearance of one.”  Davis v. \n12  Xerox, 811 F.2d 1293, 1295 (9th Cir. 1987).   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13    The Government avers that I have personal knowledge of CLSEPA’s budget and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  operations, which gives me personal knowledge about CLSEPA’s allegations regarding \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  irreparable harm.  The Government concedes that this assertion is based on a presumption of \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  personal knowledge flowing from my tenure in middle management at the organization, and they \nS d nr\nee 17  fail to identify any facts establishing that I have personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Mot. at 6.  As the Government acknowledges, I served as a Managing Attorney for CLSEPA \n19  nearly seven years ago and focused on “local or state policy advocacy and impact litigation, . . . \n20  community education, and . . . advice and counsel to community groups.”  Mot. at 3.  I do not \n21  have personal knowledge of CLSEPA’s current financial or budget position, much less do I have \n22  personal knowledge related to the merits of this case, including how the Government’s termination \n23  of funding for direct legal representation “potentially violates Congress’s express directive in the \n24  TVRPA and ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.”  See Order Granting TRO at 5.  \n25  In the absence of such personal knowledge, recusal under Section 455(b) would be inappropriate. \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 69     Filed 04/17/25     Page 9 of 9\n \n1  III.  CONCLUSION \n2  Federal judges share an obligation to “participate in [all] cases assigned,” which “is \n3  derived from the ‘judicial Power’ with which we are vested” and “reflected in our oath, by which \n4  we have obligated ourselves to ‘faithfully and impartially discharge and perform [our] duties’ and \n5  to ‘administer justice without respect to persons . . . [.]’ ” Holland, 519 F.3d at 912 (citing U.S. \n6  Const. art. III, § 1; 28 U.S.C. § 453).  I am obligated to participate in this case given the absence \n7  of partiality.  Recusal is not appropriate here under either the general provisions of Section 455(a) \n8  or the specific provisions of Section 455(b).  Therefore, I DENY the motion to recuse.   \n9   \n10  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n11  Dated: April 17, 2025 \n12   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13     \nCfi\n tla ARACELI MARTÍNEZ-OLGUÍN \ncC 14 \nirts fo United States District Judge \niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n9 ",

No. 37 \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et \n11 \nal., \n \n12 \na  Defendants. \ntr in  \nuoro 13      \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  This matter comes before the Court on a Motion for Preliminary Injunction filed by \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Plaintiff nonprofit organizations that provide legal representation to unaccompanied children in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  immigration courts across the country.  Plaintiffs challenge the recent termination of funding for \nS d nr\nee 17  counsel representing unaccompanied children by Defendants the United States Department of \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Health and Human Services (“HHS”), HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), and the \n19  United States Department of the Interior (“DOI”) (collectively, “Government” or “Defendants”).  \n20  Having considered Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendants’ response, the arguments of the Parties at the \n21  April 23, 2025 hearing, and the relevant case law, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ Motion \n22  for Preliminary Injunction for the following reasons. \n23  I.  BACKGROUND \n24  A.  Legal Framework \n25  Congress established a coordinated scheme to govern the legal representation of \n26  unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, a scheme primarily reflected in two statutes: \n27  the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (“HSA”) and the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \n28 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 2 of 28\n \n1  Protection Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”).  Giving effect to the TVPRA, ORR promulgated the \n2  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule. \n3  As relevant to this case, the HSA defines an “unaccompanied alien child” (hereafter \n4  “unaccompanied children”) as “a child who – (A) has no lawful immigration status in the United \n5  States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom – (i) there is no parent \n6  or legal guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is \n7  available to provide care and physical custody.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Further, the HSA assigns \n8  ORR broad authority over the care and custody of unaccompanied children while they are in \n9  federal custody.  This authority includes coordinating their care and placement, ensuring their best \n10  interests in custodial decisions, and developing plans to “ensure that qualified and independent \n11  legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests of each such child.”  6 U.S.C. \n12  § 279(b)(1)(A).  These responsibilities are carried out through cooperative agreements and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  contracts with care providers under ORR policies and oversight.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1); 31 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  U.S.C. § 6305. \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15     Congress enacted the TVPRA to strengthen protections for unaccompanied children.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Consistent with the HSA, the TVPRA makes the HHS Secretary responsible for the care and \nS d nr\nee 17  custody of unaccompanied children.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  It requires HHS to “ensure, to the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  greatest extent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent \n19  them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and \n20  trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n21  In April 2024, ORR promulgated the Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational \n22  Rule (“Foundational Rule”), codified at 45 C.F.R. Part 410, to establish comprehensive \n23  regulations governing programs for unaccompanied children.  The Foundational Rule, which \n24  became effective July 1, 2024, provides that ORR “shall fund legal service providers to provide \n25  direct immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children” only “to the extent \n26  ORR determines that appropriations are available,” and only if securing pro bono counsel is “not \n27  practicable.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  Other subsections of the Foundational Rule impose \n28  obligations – requiring, for example, ORR to ensure unaccompanied children receive mandatory \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 3 of 28\n \n1  services such as a “presentation concerning the rights and responsibilities of undocumented \n2  children,” “information regarding the availability of free legal assistance,” and a “confidential \n3  legal consultation.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(2)(i)-(v). \n4  B.  Congressional Funding and ORR’s Termination \n5  Since 2012, Congress has consistently appropriated funds for the direct legal \n6  representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings, including the most recent \n7  appropriation for over $5 billion to ensure “all children . . . have access to counsel in their \n8  immigration proceedings.”  Compl. ¶¶ 77-87.  Congressional appropriations for direct legal \n9  representation of unaccompanied children remain available until September 2027, including funds \n10  appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025, one week before the Government’s challenged \n11  actions.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, \n12  Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  Despite funding being \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  available, ORR decided on or about March 20, 2025, to partially terminate the contract funding \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  direct legal representation services.  Biswas Decl. (ECF 24-1) ¶¶ 12-13.  This termination \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  followed a directive memorandum signed by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration \nS d nr\nee 17  for Children and Families dated February 3, 2025.  Id. ¶¶ 13-14; see also Biswas Decl., Ex. 1 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  (ECF 24-2, the “Secretarial Directive”).  The Secretarial Directive instructed agency personnel to \n19  pause all payments to contractors and vendors related to immigration and refugee resettlement “for \n20  payment integrity.”  Id.  On March 21, 2025, DOI sent a letter to Acacia Center for Justice, the \n21  sole contractor for direct representation legal services, terminating the contract line items through \n22  which HHS and ORR provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration \n23  proceedings.  Compl. ¶ 11; Biswas Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 2 (ECF 24-3, the “Cancellation Order”).  The \n24  Cancellation Order instructed Acacia to “immediately stop all work” on the contract.  Id.  The \n25  Cancellation Order terminated funding for direct legal representation services “for the \n26  Government’s convenience” and made no reference to the Secretarial Directive.  Id.  Acacia \n27  notified its direct representation subcontractors, including Plaintiffs, of the Cancellation Order the \n28  same day.  See, e.g., FIRRP Decl. (ECF 7-4) ¶ 32. \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 4 of 28\n \n1  C.  Plaintiff Organizations \n2  Plaintiffs include the following organizations: Community Legal Services in East Palo \n3  Alto, Social Justice Collaborative, Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, Estrella del Paso, Florence \n4  Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project, Galveston-Houston Immigrant Representation Project, \n5  Immigrant Defenders Law Center, National Immigrant Justice Center, Northwest Immigrant \n6  Rights Project, Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network, and Vermont Asylum Assistance \n7  Project (collectively, “Plaintiffs”).  Plaintiffs previously received funding for their work from \n8  ORR disbursed through Acacia Center for Justice.  Compl. ¶¶ 64-65; 88.  The organizations share \n9  the mission of ensuring persons in immigration proceedings, including the uniquely vulnerable \n10  population of unaccompanied children, have legal representation.  See, e.g., FIRRP Supp. Decl. \n11  (ECF 37-5) ¶ 5 (“Since the Florence Project began serving children in 2000, a central tenet of our \n12  mission has been that no child should have to stand alone in court.”); NWIRP Decl. (ECF 7-10) \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  ¶¶ 1-2 (Northwest Immigrant Rights Project “provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  children and youth” in accordance with its “mission to promote justice by defending and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic advocacy, and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  community education.”); KIND Decl. (ECF 7-18) ¶ 1 (describing KIND’s “mission [to] ensur[e] \nS d nr\nee 17  that no child appears in immigration court without high-quality legal representation.”); see also \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Compl. ¶ 102. \n19  In response to the Cancellation Order, and the resulting funding termination, Plaintiffs \n20  state that they have been forced to choose between cutting vital organizational programs or \n21  dismissing their specialized and seasoned attorneys.  See, e.g., GHIRP Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-2) ¶ 3 \n22  (describing the layoff of eight staff members due to the Cancellation Order’s termination of \n23  funding).  Further, the Cancellation Order prevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of \n24  unaccompanied children direct representation, impeding Plaintiffs from ensuring unaccompanied \n25  children are supported by legal counsel.  See, e.g., Estrella del Paso Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-4) ¶¶ 3-\n26  4; ImmDef Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-5) ¶ 8.  The unaccompanied children to whom Plaintiffs would \n27  normally have provided representation are instead facing immigration court proceedings without \n28  counsel.  See, e.g., GHIRP Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-2) ¶¶ 4-7. Consequently, “[t]his means that \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 5 of 28\n \n1  children who want voluntary departure will have their return home unacceptably delayed, [and] \n2  victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections they deserve[.]”  ImmDef Decl. \n3  (ECF 7-8) ¶ 25. \n4  D.  Procedural History \n5  Plaintiffs brought this lawsuit against the Government on the bases that the Cancellation \n6  Order (1) violates the TVPRA, (2) conflicts with the Foundational Rule, and (3) constitutes an \n7  “arbitrary and capricious” agency action, each of which gives rise to a claim for violation of the \n8  Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Compl. ¶¶ 127-46.   \n9  On March 27, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order (“TRO”) and \n10  preliminary injunction.  ECF 7.  The Court issued an order setting a hearing, as well as a deadline \n11  for the Government’s written response to Plaintiffs’ TRO motion.  ECF 17.  On March 31, 2025, \n12  in accordance with the schedule set on March 27, the Government filed its opposition to Plaintiffs’ \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  motion.  See ECF 24.  On April 1, 2025, the parties appeared for a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  ECF 30.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  After taking the matter under submission, the Court granted Plaintiffs’ motion, issued a \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  TRO, and set an expedited briefing schedule on Plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction.  \nS d nr\nee 17  ECF 33.  The TRO provided,  \nth\nintr  \nUo\nN 18  Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of \n19  March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), \n20  and ORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), \nparticularly ORR’s provision of funds for direct legal representation \n21  services to unaccompanied children.  This injunction precludes \ncutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its \n22  duration. \n23  ECF 33 at 7. \n24  After the TRO grant, several motions were filed.  Plaintiffs filed their motion for \n25  preliminary injunction (ECF 37), as well as two motions to enforce the TRO (ECF 40, ECF 53).  \n26  The Government moved to dissolve the TRO (ECF 38) and for recusal of a district judge pursuant \n27  to Title 28 U.S.C. § 455 (ECF 47).  Finding that consideration of the recusal motion constituted \n28  good cause, the Court extended the TRO for an additional 14 days in accordance with Federal \n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 6 of 28\n \n1  Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2), set a briefing schedule on the recusal motion, and continued the \n2  hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.  See ECF 48.  The Government sought to \n3  appeal the TRO following its extension.  ECF 56.  The Government additionally moved to stay the \n4  TRO pending that appeal.  ECF 57.   \n5  Following complete briefing, this Court denied the Government’s motion for recusal.  ECF \n6  69.  A panel of the Ninth Circuit subsequently determined that the TRO was not appealable and \n7  dismissed the Government’s appeal, see Cmty. Legal Servs. in East Palo Alto v. Dept. Health & \n8  Hum. Servs., Case No. 25-2358, Order (9th Cir. Apr. 18, 2025), rendering the Government’s \n9  motion for a stay pending appeal (ECF 57) moot.1  The Court denied the Government’s motion to \n10  dissolve the TRO by written order dated April 21, 2025.  ECF 75.  At the time of writing, the TRO \n11  remains in effect. \na  12  II.  DISCUSSION \ntr in\nuoro 13  Plaintiffs move for a preliminary injunction on much of the same reasoning underlying the \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  TRO.  The Government opposes on several bases.  The Court first addresses the Government’s \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  arguments regarding threshold issues of standing and subject matter jurisdiction before turning to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  the merits of Plaintiffs’ motion. \nS d nr\nee 17  A.  Plaintiffs’ Standing \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  The Court understands the Government to challenge Plaintiffs’ standing under two \n19  theories.  First, the Government contends that Plaintiffs lack Article III standing to bring this \n20  lawsuit because Plaintiffs’ purported harms are not redressable by a favorable ruling from this \n21  Court.  Second, the Government contends that Plaintiffs fall outside the “zone of interests” \n22  necessary to bring their APA claims.  Though not squarely challenged by Government, the Court \n23  first considers whether the Plaintiffs have adequately established organizational injury in fact in \n24  support of Article III standing and then takes up each of the Government’s standing arguments in \n25  turn. \n26 \n \n1 The Government sought en banc review, which was denied.  Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo Alto \n27 \nv. United States Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 25-2358, 2025 WL 1203167, at *1 (9th \nCir. Apr. 25, 2025). \n28 \n \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 7 of 28\n \n1  1.  Article III \n2  Article III standing requires that a “plaintiff must have (1) suffered an injury in fact, \n3  (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be \n4  redressed by a favorable judicial decision.”  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 338 (2016).  \n5  “To establish injury in fact, a plaintiff must show that he or she suffered ‘an invasion of a legally \n6  protected interest’ that is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or \n7  hypothetical.’ ”  Id. at 338 (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992)).  \n8  a.  Organizational Injury in Fact \n9  “Organizations can assert standing on behalf of their own members, or in their own \n10  right[.]”  East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 662 (9th Cir. 2021) (“EBSC III”) \n11  (citations omitted).  “[A]n organization has direct standing to sue where it establishes that the \n12  defendant’s behavior has frustrated its mission and caused it to divert resources in response to that \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  frustration of purpose.”  Id. at 663; see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 379 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  (1982); Fair Hous. of Marin v. Combs, 285 F.3d 899, 905 (9th Cir. 2002) (setting forth \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  organizational standing test of “frustration of mission” coupled with “diversion of resources”).  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Organizational plaintiffs may also “demonstrate organizational standing” by showing that a \nS d nr\nee 17  government policy “will cause them to lose a substantial amount of funding.”  East Bay Sanctuary \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Covenant v. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 766-67 (9th Cir. 2018) (“EBSC I”). \n19  Here, Plaintiffs establish that the Government’s conduct “has frustrated [their] mission and \n20  caused [them] to divert resources in response to that frustration of purpose.”  EBSC III, 993 F.3d \n21  at 663.  The organizations share the mission of ensuring persons in immigration proceedings, \n22  including the uniquely vulnerable population of unaccompanied children, have legal \n23  representation.  See, e.g., FIRRP Supp. Decl. (ECF 37-5) ¶ 5 (“Since the Florence Project began \n24  serving children in 2000, a central tenet of our mission has been that no child should have to stand \n25  alone in court.”); NWIRP Decl. (ECF 7-10) ¶¶ 1-2 (Northwest Immigrant Rights Project “provides \n26  legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth” in accordance with its “mission to \n27  promote justice by defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, \n28  systemic advocacy, and community education.”); KIND Decl. (ECF 7-18) ¶ 1 (describing KIND’s \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 8 of 28\n \n1  “mission [to] ensur[e] that no child appears in immigration court without high-quality legal \n2  representation.”).  Plaintiffs’ missions and ethical duties drive them to continue legal \n3  representation of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings.  By cancelling all funding \n4  for direct legal representation of unaccompanied children, the Government “perceptibly impair[s]” \n5  Plaintiffs’ ability to fulfill their shared organizational mission.  See EBSC III, 993 F.3d at 663.  \n6  Plaintiffs present significant evidence that unaccompanied children were not provided counsel \n7  following the Cancellation Order, leaving them unrepresented in immigration proceedings, subject \n8  to removal and/or unable to pursue desired relief.  See, e.g., KIND Decl. ¶¶ 13-19; Estrella Supp. \n9  Decl. (ECF 40-2) ¶¶ 4-9.  Plaintiffs thus satisfy the “frustration of mission” requirement for \n10  organizational standing as set forth by this circuit.  \n11  In addition to demonstrating a frustration of mission, Plaintiffs must also establish that the \n12  Government’s actions required them to divert resources that they would have spent in other ways.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  See Comite de Jornaleros de Redondo Beach v. City of Redondo Beach, 657 F3d 936, 943 (9th \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Cir. 2011).  Plaintiffs have needed to draw on funds intended for other organizational purposes to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  respond to the suddenly diminished funding resulting from the Government’s Cancellation Order.  \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  See, e.g., FIRRP Supp. Decl. (ECF 37-5) ¶ 3 (“Florence Project has continued to provide services \nS d nr\nee 17  to our clients, drawing on funding from other sources and fundraising to ensure that we are able to \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  provide legal representation, pro bono placement and mentoring, additional legal services, court \n19  preparation, and friend of court services to unrepresented children in keeping with our mission for \n20  as long as we can responsibly financially manage to do so.”); NIJC Supp. Decl. (ECF 37-11) ¶ 3 \n21  (“Since the ORR funding ceased, NIJC was forced to temporarily shift staff members to work on \n22  other NIJC projects.”).  Given the ways in which Plaintiffs have had to divert resources to \n23  adequately advocate for unaccompanied children, there can be little doubt that the Government’s \n24  conduct has “impaired [Plaintiffs’] ability to provide [legal] services” to unaccompanied children, \n25  and “there can be no question that the organization[s] ha[ve] suffered injury in fact.”  Havens, 455 \n26  U.S. at 379; see also EBSC III, 993 F.3d at 663 (finding standing where new administrative rule \n27 \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 9 of 28\n \n1  barring access to asylum procedures for certain migrants caused diversion of resources for \n2  organizations formed to assist asylum seekers).2 \n3  b.  Redressability \n4  The Government asserts that Plaintiffs cannot satisfy Article III’s requirements because \n5  they cannot establish that a favorable ruling would redress their alleged injuries.  See Opp. at 12-\n6  14.  Redressability, the third element of Article III standing, demands that it “be likely, as opposed \n7  to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Lujan, 504 U.S. \n8  at 561 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  Plaintiffs’ burden to establish \n9  redressability is “relatively modest.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 171 (1997); Tucson v. City \n10  of Seattle, 91 F.4th 1318, 1325 (9th Cir. 2024).  “Plaintiffs need not demonstrate that there is a \n11  guarantee that their injuries will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Renee v. Duncan, 686 F.3d \n12  1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal citation and quotation omitted).  Rather, Plaintiffs need only \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  show that a favorable decision would result in a “change in a legal status,” and that a “practical \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  consequence of that change would amount to a significant increase in the likelihood that the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  plaintiff would obtain relief that directly redresses the injury suffered.”  Utah v. Evans, 536 U.S. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  452, 464 (2002). \nS d nr\nee 17  The Government argues that Plaintiffs’ purported harms are not redressable because the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  agencies hold no obligation to continue to fund the Plaintiff organizations.  Opp. at 12-13.  \n19  However, this argument distorts Plaintiffs’ claims as sounding in contract, an incorrect \n20  characterization for reasons discussed in greater depth below.  See Section II.B.  Plaintiffs pursue \n21  injunctive relief requiring the Government to ensure legal representation of unaccompanied \n22  children in immigration proceedings.  Plaintiffs concede that the Government can accomplish this \n23  by means other than by paying for their services and, if the Government takes steps to ensure \n24  direct representation through others, the harm Plaintiffs suffer in the form of providing \n25 \n \n2 Though standing is not challenged on this basis, Plaintiffs likely also have standing to challenge \n26 \nthe Government’s Cancellation Order because of the new and ongoing operational costs they \nallege.  City and Cnty. of San Francisco v. United States Citizenship and Immigration Servs., 944 \n27 \nF.3d 773, 787-88 (9th Cir. 2019).  Plaintiffs have suffered near-immediate financial impacts, and \nthey have thus made a sufficient showing of concrete and imminent economic injury.  See, e.g., \n28 \nEstrella del Paso Decl. ¶ 13 (describing staff furloughs in response to Cancellation Order). \n9 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 10 of 28\n \n1  representation without payment or diverting resources would be alleviated.  See Reply (ECF 63) at \n2  14.  The reinstatement of funding for direct representation to unaccompanied children increases \n3  the likelihood that Plaintiffs will obtain relief, either through funding to continue their own \n4  representations or an alternative plan providing legal representation to unaccompanied children \n5  consistent with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  Id.  The requested injunctive relief thus is \n6  likely to ensure that the unaccompanied children have and maintain counsel, which will redress \n7  the injury to Plaintiffs’ missions, and this is sufficient to establish standing. \n8  2.  APA – Zone of Interests \n9  The Government avers that Plaintiffs fall outside the zone of interests to bring their APA \n10  claims because the TVPRA was not enacted to protect service providers’ finances or operational \n11  goals.  See Opp at 7-6.  The Government contends that Plaintiffs fall outside the zone of interests \n12  because the organizations are not in the class of unaccompanied minors intended for the TVPRA’s \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  protections.  Id.  These arguments miss the mark.   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “The breadth of the zone-of-interests test varies, depending on the provisions of law at \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  issue.  Under the APA, the test is not especially demanding.  The zone-of-interests analysis \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  forecloses suit only when a plaintiff’s interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the \nS d nr\nee 17  purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that Congress authorized that \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  plaintiff to sue.”  EBSC III, 993 F.3d at 667 (citing Lexmark Int’l, Inc., v. Static Control \n19  Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014)) (internal quotation marks omitted).  “[B]ecause the \n20  APA provides a cause of action only to those ‘suffering legal wrong because of agency action . . . \n21  within the meaning of a relevant statute,’ the relevant zone of interest is that of the” TVPRA.  See \n22  id. at 667. \n23  Plaintiffs’ interests in ensuring TVPRA protections for unaccompanied children, including \n24  direct representation legal services, is consistent with the TVPRA’s purpose of “[p]reventing the \n25  trafficking of unaccompanied [noncitizen] children found in the United States by ensuring that \n26  they are not repatriated into the hands of traffickers or abusive families, and are well cared for.”  \n27  H.R. Rep. No. 110-430 at 35 (2007); see EBSC III, 993 F.3d at 668 (concluding that courts are \n28  “not limited to considering the specific statute under which plaintiffs sued, but may consider any \n10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 11 of 28\n \n1  provision that helps [them] to understand Congress’ overall purposes in enacting the statute.”) \n2  (internal quotation marks omitted); see also EBSC I, 932 F.3d at 768 (finding organizational \n3  plaintiffs in the Immigration and Nationality Act’s zone of interests because their “interest in \n4  aiding immigrants seeking asylum is consistent with the INA’s purpose to establish the statutory \n5  procedure for granting asylum to refugees”) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  \n6  Under the TVPRA, the Government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable[,] . . . that all \n7  unaccompanied [noncitizen] children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary of \n8  [HHS] or the Secretary of Homeland Security . . . have counsel to represent them in legal \n9  proceedings” and that, “[t]o the greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of [HHS] shall make \n10  every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel[.]”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Indeed, ORR \n11  contracted with Acacia Center, and Acacia in turn subcontracted with Plaintiffs to fill this role \n12  contemplated by the TVPRA.  Plaintiffs fit within the zone of interests because their interests are \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  congruent with the TVPRA’s and Foundational Rule’s beneficiaries, namely, unaccompanied \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  children.  Indeed, Plaintiffs’ missions align with Congress’s purpose in enacting the TVPRA, \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  ensuring representation for unaccompanied children to prevent their trafficking and abuse.  EBSC \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  I, 932 F.3d at 768 (finding organizational plaintiffs in zone of interests where “Congress took \nS d nr\nee 17  steps to ensure that pro bono legal services of the type that the Organizations provide are available \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to” those protected by the relevant statutes).  Given the zone of interests test for APA claims is not \n19  “especially demanding,” Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 130, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs have \n20  more than met their burden to show that their interests are “marginally related to” and “arguably \n21  within” the scope of the relevant statutes.  See EBSC III, 993 F.3d at 668. \n22  B.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction (Tucker Act) \n23  Having resolved the Government’s challenges to Plaintiffs’ standing, the Court turns to the \n24  Government’s argument that the Tucker Act requires Plaintiffs’ claims be brought in the Federal \n25  Court of Claims because they sound in contract, and thus this Court lacks subject matter \n26  jurisdiction.  See Opp. at 8-11.  The Government is mistaken. \n27  The Tucker Act grants exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of Federal Claims over suits \n28  based on “any express or implied contract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 12 of 28\n \n1  However, “the mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering \n2  some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and \n3  deprive the court of jurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, \n4  968 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  “Generally speaking, the Tucker Act does not permit the [Court of Federal \n5  Claims] to grant equitable or declaratory relief.”  N. Star Alaska v. United States, 9 F.3d 1430, \n6  1432 (9th Cir. 1993).  “Due to this limited remedial authority, a contract-based action falls within \n7  the scope of the Tucker Act only if the plaintiff seeks money damages for the breach of a \n8  government contract.”  United Aeronautical Corp. v. United States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1026 \n9  (9th Cir. 2023) (emphasis in original).  Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has long recognized that \n10  “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a sufficient \n11  reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages’ ” within the meaning of the APA’s and \n12  Tucker Act’s jurisdictional limitations.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 893 (1988) \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (holding that federal district courts, not the Court of Federal Claims, have jurisdiction to review \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  federal agency action such as the denial of reimbursements owed for Medicaid expenditures). \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  The Ninth Circuit has held that the Tucker Act “ ‘impliedly forbid[s]’ an APA action \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  seeking injunctive and declaratory relief only if that action is a ‘disguised’ breach-of-contract \nS d nr\nee 17  claim.”  United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026 (citing Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968).  To \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  assess whether an APA claim is an improperly disguised contract claim, the court adopted the \n19  same two-part test from the D.C. Circuit’s Megapulse decision, requiring assessment of (1) “the \n20  source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and (2) “the type of relief sought (or \n21  appropriate).”  United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1026 (citing Doe v. Tenet, 329 F.3d 1135, \n22  1141 (9th Cir. 2003)); see also Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.  To assess the “source of rights” that \n23  form the basis of a plaintiff’s claim, the Court must consider whether: (a) the plaintiff’s asserted \n24  rights and the government’s purported authority arise from statute or contract; (b) the plaintiff’s \n25  rights “exist[ ] prior to and apart from rights created under the contract”; and (c) the plaintiff \n26  “seek[s] to enforce any duty imposed upon” the government “by the . . . relevant contracts to \n27  which” the government “is a party.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 \n28  (D.C. Cir. 2022) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 13 of 28\n \n1  Here, the source of Plaintiffs’ claims is the APA.  They aver that the Government’s refusal \n2  to fund direct representation for unaccompanied children violates the agencies’ obligations under \n3  the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  They advance that the Government’s conduct gives rise \n4  to a claim under the APA as contradictory to law, another claim under the APA as contravening \n5  the agencies’ regulations, and a third claim under the APA for arbitrary and capricious acts.  \n6  Plaintiffs assert no breach-of-contract claim for money damages.  Indeed, although the \n7  Government repeatedly contends that Plaintiffs seek to enforce contractual rights, the contract \n8  underlying the Cancellation Order was between DOI and Acacia Center – these legal services \n9  providers were not parties to that contract and assert no rights related to that contract.3  Moreover, \n10  as discussed above, Plaintiffs’ asserted harms arise from the frustration of their mission and \n11  diversion of resources to ensure unaccompanied children have legal representation.  Plaintiffs’ \n12  asserted rights do not rely on or arise from any contract, are not contract claims in disguise, and \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  thus do not implicate the Tucker Act under the first prong of the Megapulse test. \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Turning to the second prong, the type of relief sought, Plaintiffs seek “declaratory and \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  injunctive relief” under the APA to prevent the Government from refusing to fund counsel for \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  unaccompanied children.  Their action does not seek money damages to compensate them for \nS d nr\nee 17  losses; instead, they seek an injunction and vacatur of the purportedly unlawful Cancellation \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Order.  That such relief may result in the payment of money does not transform their claim into \n19  one for money damages.  Cf. Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893.  Plaintiffs could not obtain the injunctive \n20  relief they seek in the Court of Federal Claims, which “has no power to grant equitable relief[.]” \n21  Richardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465 (1973).  Because Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief rather \n22  than money damages, the claims do not implicate the Tucker Act under the second prong of the \n23  Megapulse test.  Finally, Plaintiffs do not seek to enforce any duty imposed on the Government by \n24  a contract.  The Government makes clear that the contract by which ORR funded direct \n25 \n \n26 \n3 Even if Plaintiffs brought a claim for breach of the contract between DOI and Acacia Center \nunder a theory of third-party liability, they likely would not be able to litigate in the Federal Court \n27 \nof Claims – given the absence of privity between the Government and subcontractors like \nPlaintiffs, there is no express or implied contract that would implicate the Tucker Act.  See United \n28 \nStates v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 713 F.2d 1541, 1550-51 (Fed. Cir. 1983). \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 14 of 28\n \n1  representation of unaccompanied children was coming to a close by its own terms, potentially \n2  hampering any potential claim to enforce a duty under that contract.  See Biswas Decl. (ECF 24-1) \n3  ¶ 11 (stating that the Government’s contract with Acacia was set to expire March 29, 2025).  \n4  Plaintiffs’ claims for injunctive relief do not seek enforcement of any contractual duty; rather, they \n5  pursue enforcement of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  See Compl. ¶¶ 127-46. Because all \n6  of the Crowley Government Services factors indicate that Plaintiffs’ claims do not sound in \n7  contract, the Court rejects the Government’s argument that it lacks jurisdiction over this case. \n8  The Government resists this conclusion by attempting to analogize this case to the \n9  Supreme Court’s recent order staying a different district court’s temporary restraining order in \n10  Department of Education v. California, 604 U.S. ----, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025).4  In Department of \n11  Education, the state government plaintiffs brought an APA challenge to the Department of \n12  Education’s termination of contracts for the payment of certain educational grants to the respective \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  states.  Id., 145 S. Ct. at 968.  The district court issued a TRO enjoining the Government from \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  terminating the grants and requiring “the Government to pay out past-due grant obligations and to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  continue paying obligations as they accrue.”  Id.  The Supreme Court granted the Government’s \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  request for a stay of the TRO on the basis that the district court “lacked jurisdiction to order the \nS d nr\nee 17  payment of money under the APA.”  Id.  The Court further held, based in significant part on the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  relief pursued by the state governments, that the Government would likely show the district court \n19  lacked jurisdiction over the contractual claims calling for payment, as those claims are committed \n20  to the Court of Federal Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act.  Id. (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)). \n21  In the course of this litigation, this Court has already found Department of Education \n22  insufficient to warrant dissolution of the TRO.  ECF 75.  It adds that Department of Education is \n23  distinguishable from Plaintiffs’ APA claims related to the termination of funding for legal services \n24  for unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings.  These Plaintiffs, in contrast to the state \n25  governments in Department of Education, are subcontractors lacking privity with the Government, \n26 \n \n4 The Government earlier moved to dissolve the TRO in reliance on the same order from the \n27 \nSupreme Court’s emergency docket.  See ECF 38.  The Court denied the Government’s motion to \ndissolve the TRO.  ECF 75.  The Court’s earlier reasoning regarding the inapplicability of \n28 \nDepartment of Education remains applicable. \n14 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 15 of 28\n \n1  and they have no contractual rights to enforce.  Moreover, though the Government regularly \n2  characterizes their claims as nothing more than a money grab, the legal service providers do not \n3  seek payout – they seek to ensure representation for unaccompanied children in immigration \n4  proceedings, regardless of which lawyers provide it.  Department of Education has no bearing here \n5  given the lack of (1) contractual relationship or (2) contractual relief sought against the United \n6  States by Plaintiffs, the two hallmarks of actions left to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court of \n7  Claims.   \n8  For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ claims have no business before the Federal Court of Claims \n9  and this Court has jurisdiction to consider Plaintiffs’ APA claims. \n10  C.  Preliminary Injunction \n11  Having rejected the Government’s jurisdictional arguments, the Court next examines \n12  whether Plaintiffs are entitled to the extraordinary relief they seek.  To obtain preliminary \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  injunctive relief, the moving party must show: (1) a likelihood of success on the merits, (2) a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  likelihood of irreparable harm to the moving party in the absence of preliminary relief, (3) the \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  balance of equities tips in the favor of the moving party, and (4) an injunction is in the public \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  interest.  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Where the government \nS d nr\nee 17  is a party, courts merge the analysis of the final two Winter factors, the balance of equities and the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  public interest.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing \n19  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Courts “explore the relative harms to applicant and \n20  respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.”  Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. \n21  & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \n22  The Winter factors may be evaluated on a sliding scale, such that preliminary relief may be issued \n23  when the moving party demonstrates “that serious questions going to the merits were raised and \n24  the balance of hardships tips sharply in the plaintiff’s favor.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, \n25  632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \n26  1.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n27  The APA establishes a “basic presumption of judicial review [for] one ‘suffering legal \n28  wrong because of agency action.’ ”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, \n15 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 16 of 28\n \n1  591 U.S. 1, 16 (2020) (citation omitted).  “The [APA] was adopted to provide, inter alia, that \n2  administrative policies affecting individual rights and obligations be promulgated pursuant to \n3  certain stated procedures so as to avoid the inherently arbitrary nature of unpublished ad hoc \n4  determinations.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 232 (1974).  To that end, “[t]he APA sets forth \n5  the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public and their actions subject to \n6  review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 (1992).  It authorizes judicial \n7  review for those “suffering legal wrong” or “adversely affected” by a “final agency action for \n8  which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704.5 \n9  The Government contends that Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their \n10  APA claims because the provisions at issue leave discretion to the agencies that evades judicial \n11  review.  The Court takes up this issue first, and after concluding the conduct at issue is not \n12  committed to Government discretion, it then considers the substance of Plaintiffs’ three APA \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  claims.  Though Plaintiffs’ need only show a likelihood of success on one claim to demonstrate \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  likelihood of success in support of a preliminary injunction, the Court analyzes each of their \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  claims. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  a.  Bar to Review \nS d nr\nee 17  The Government argues that Title 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2) precludes judicial review of the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Cancelation Order.  Section 701(a)(2) provides an exception to the waiver of sovereign immunity \n19  found in Sections 702 and 706 of the APA.  Under Section 701(a)(2), a court may not review an \n20  agency action if the “agency action is committed to agency discretion by law.”  However, the \n21  Section 701(a)(2) waiver is a narrow exception. \n22  An agency action “is committed to agency discretion by law” only “where a statute is \n23  drawn in such broad terms that in a given case there is no law to apply, and the court would have \n24  no meaningful standard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Webster v. \n25 \n \n26 \n5 The parties do not appear to dispute that the Cancellation Order constitutes a final agency action \nfor purposes of APA review.  In the interest of thoroughness, the Court finds that the Cancellation \n27 \nOrder is a final agency action as the Government has not indicated, much less evidenced, that it \nintends to take further steps in its decision-making process and, thus, the termination of funding \n28 \nleads to legal consequences.  See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997). \n16 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 17 of 28\n \n1  Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 592 (1988); see Jajati v. United States Customs & Border Prot., 102 F.4th \n2  1011, 1014 (9th Cir. 2024) (holding that the Section 701(a)(2) exception applies when “there is \n3  truly no law to apply”).  The Supreme Court requires courts to “read the exception in § 701(a)(2) \n4  quite narrowly” such that it should apply only in “rare circumstances.”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. \n5  Fish & Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018) (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993)).  \n6  Even when Congress intended to create a wide zone within which decisions are committed to an \n7  agency’s discretion, the agency still must meet “permissible statutory objectives.”  Lincoln, 508 \n8  U.S. at 183. \n9  In one of the few cases in which the Supreme Court applied the Section 701(a)(2) \n10  exception, it held the exception applied in cases involving “agency decisions that courts have \n11  traditionally regarded as unreviewable, such as the allocation of funds from a lump-sum \n12  appropriation.”  Weyerhaeuser, 586 U.S. at 23 (citing Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 191).  In Lincoln, the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Court found the Indian Health Service’s particular use of funds from a “lump sum” grant was \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  committed to its discretion because “the very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to give an \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192.  That is, “a lump-\nS d nr\nee 17  sum appropriation reflects a congressional recognition that an agency must be allowed flexibility \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  to shift funds within a particular appropriation account so that the agency can make necessary \n19  adjustments for unforeseen developments and changing requirements.”  Id. at 193 (internal citation \n20  omitted). \n21  The Government argues that the appropriation for direct legal representation of \n22  unaccompanied children at issue here mirrors the lump sum appropriation over which the Indian \n23  Health Service maintained discretion to allocate funds in Lincoln.  See Opp. at 11-12.  But unlike \n24  the appropriation in Lincoln, the TVPRA mandates direct legal representation, and Congress has \n25  expressly appropriated funds for services required under the TVPRA, including direct \n26  representation.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. \n27  119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n28  118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664-65 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  The Government’s \n17 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 18 of 28\n \n1  cancellation of all funding for direct representation is not the type of judgment regarding how to \n2  spend appropriated funds that is presumptively committed to agency discretion. \n3  Beyond the appropriations question, the Court has several meaningful standards against \n4  which to judge the agencies’ discretion.  Cf. Weyerhaeuser, 586 U.S. at 23.  Indeed, the TVPRA \n5  and the Foundational Rule provide “meaningful standards under which courts can review whether \n6  [the Government] wielded its discretion in a permissible manner.”  Jajati, 102 F.4th at 1014.  Both \n7  the TVPRA and Foundational Rule include language describing the Government’s obligations to \n8  fund direct representation.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (HHS “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n9  practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal \n10  proceedings”); 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (ORR “shall fund legal service providers . . . subject to \n11  ORR’s discretion and available appropriations”).  Such statutory and regulatory language offers a \n12  clear standard to assess the Government’s actions; therefore, Section 701(a)(2) does not bar review \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  of the Government’s actions in this case.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  b.  First Claim – Agency Action Not in Accordance with Law \nrts fo\niD tc 15  The APA requires reviewing courts to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  found to be . . . not in accordance with law”; “contrary to constitutional right [or] power”; or “in \nS d nr\nee 17  excess of statutory jurisdiction [or] authority.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)-(C).  Plaintiffs argue that the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Government’s termination of funding for direct legal representation violates the TVPRA.  See \n19  Mot. (ECF 37) at 11.  The relevant subsection provides that the Government “shall ensure, to the \n20  greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal “counsel to represent \n21  them in legal proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n22  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).6  By cancelling all funding for direct representation of unaccompanied \n23 \n \n24  6 The provision reads in full:  \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the \n25 \ngreatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all \n26 \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody \nof the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are \n27 \nnot described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent \nthem in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \n28 \nmistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the greatest extent \n18 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 19 of 28\n \n1  children and failing to ensure that the children receive counsel when funds remain available for \n2  that purpose, Plaintiffs contend, the Government violates the express mandate of the TVPRA. \n3  The Government asserts that the TVPRA “does not mandate government-funded legal \n4  representation,” Opp (ECF 55) at 9, arguing Section 235 of the TVPRA merely “encourages” \n5  HHS to ensure unaccompanied children have counsel “to the greatest extent practicable,” id. at 11.  \n6  The Court disagrees.  Section 235 creates an affirmative obligation on the Government, requiring \n7  the agencies “shall ensure” unaccompanied children have legal counsel “to the greatest extent \n8  practicable.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  There is no dispute that congressionally appropriated funds \n9  for legal representation are available, making the provision of direct legal services “practicable,” \n10  particularly in the absence of alternative methods to provide counsel.  See Further Consolidated \n11  Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L.118-47, § 4, 130 Stat. 460, 461.  The Government here \n12  terminated all funding for direct legal services through its Cancellation Order, see Biswas Decl., \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Ex. 2 (ECF 24-3), effectively eliminating direct representation for unaccompanied children.  \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8; VAAP Decl. (ECF 7-7) ¶¶ 20-21.  While the Government posits that “ ‘to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  the greatest extent practicable’ cannot reasonably be construed as a mandate for HHS to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  unconditionally pay for direct immigration legal representation for all” unaccompanied children, \nS d nr\nee 17  that is not what Plaintiffs seek nor what the TVPRA requires.  Opp. at 15.  The TVPRA’s proviso \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  that HHS “shall ensure” counsel to represent unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent \n19  practicable” requires something more than zero expenditure where appropriated funds are \n20  available and the agencies fail to show any effort to ensure representation through alternative \n21  means.  The Government violates the TVPRA by withholding funding for direct legal \n22  representation entirely, with no supplemental plan to ensure unaccompanied children have legal \n23  counsel “to the greatest extent practicable.”  Cf. Pacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-255-JNW, 2025 \n24  WL 655075, at *18 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (finding that withholding congressionally \n25 \n26   \npracticable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make \n27  every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to \nprovide representation to such children without charge. \n28 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n19 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 20 of 28\n \n1  appropriated funding for private service providers likely violated the APA and supported the grant \n2  of a preliminary injunction).  On this basis, Plaintiffs show likelihood of success on their first \n3  APA claim. \n4  c.  Second Claim – Accardi Violation \n5  Under the Accardi doctrine, “an administrative agency is required to adhere to its own \n6  internal operating procedures.”  Church of Scientology of Cal. v. United States, 920 F.2d 1481, \n7  1487 (9th Cir. 1990) (citing United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 \n8  (1954)).  In accordance with this principle, agencies must follow a regulation if they promulgate \n9  one.  Nat’l Ass’n of Home Builders v. Norton, 340 F.3d 835, 852 (9th Cir. 2003).  To establish an \n10  APA claim under the Accardi doctrine, Plaintiffs must show both that (1) the Government violated \n11  its own regulations, and (2) Plaintiffs suffer substantial prejudice as a result of that violation.  See \n12  Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8-9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024). \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Here, Plaintiffs aver that the Government violated the Foundational Rule, under which \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  “ORR shall fund legal service providers” “[t]o the extent ORR determines that appropriations are \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  available and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  45 C.F.R. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  § 410.1309(a)(4).7  The Government argues that interpreting the Foundational Rule to require \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\ninUtro  \nN 18 \n7 The provision reads in full: \n19  Direct immigration legal representation services for unaccompanied \nchildren currently or previously under ORR care. To the extent ORR \n20  determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not \npracticable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund \n21  legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal \nrepresentation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s \n22  discretion and available appropriations. Examples of direct \nimmigration legal representation include, but are not limited to: \n23 \n(i) For unrepresented unaccompanied children who become enrolled \nin ORR Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) programs, provided \n24 \nthey have not yet obtained immigration relief or reached 18 years of \nage at the time of retention of an attorney; \n25 \n(ii) For unaccompanied children in ORR care who are in \n26  proceedings before EOIR, including unaccompanied children \nseeking voluntary departure, and for whom other available \n27  assistance does not satisfy the legal needs of the individual child; \n(iii) For unaccompanied children released to a sponsor residing in \n28 \nthe defined service area of the same legal service provider who \n20 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 21 of 28\n \n1  continued funding of direct representation for unaccompanied children conflicts with Title 8 \n2  U.S.C. § 1362, which provides that the privilege of being represented by counsel in immigration \n3  proceedings shall be “at no expense to the Government.”  See Opp. at 15.  The Court finds no \n4  conflict between these two provisions.  Section 1362 simply clarifies that Gideon v. Wainwright, \n5  372 U.S. 335 (1963), does not extend to immigration proceedings – meaning persons subject to \n6  removal proceedings have a right to counsel, but that right does not require the Government to \n7  provide such counsel.  The Foundational Rule does not conflict with Section 1362 because it does \n8  not create a substantive right to counsel at the expense of the Government.  Instead, it creates an \n9  obligation for ORR to seek out direct representation counsel for unaccompanied children, \n10  including by securing pro bono counsel or utilizing appropriated funds when ORR is not able to \n11  secure pro bono counsel.  It is undisputed that appropriations for direct representation remain \n12  available, and the Government has evidenced no effort to ensure pro bono counsel.  Thus, the \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Government cannot invoke this perceived statutory conflict as a basis for failing to comply with its \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  obligations under the Foundational Rule.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Changing tack, the Government next acknowledges the Foundational Rule obliges ORR to \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain \nS d nr\nee 17  unaccompanied children,” but emphasizes the discretion ORR retains, as the obligation to fund \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  exists only “to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available,” and only if securing \n19  pro bono counsel is impractical.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  The Government contrasts this \n20  provision to other subsections that leave ORR no discretion.  For instance, the Foundational Rule \n21  explicitly requires ORR to ensure unaccompanied children receive mandatory services such as a \n22  “presentation concerning the rights and responsibilities of undocumented children,” “information \n23  regarding the availability of free legal assistance,” and a “confidential legal consultation.”  45 \n24  C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(2)(i)-(v).  According to the Government, this intentional distinction clarifies \n25 \n \nprovided the child legal services in ORR care, to promote continuity \n26 \nof legal services; and \n27  (iv) For other unaccompanied children, to the extent ORR \ndetermines that appropriations are available. \n28 \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). \n21 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 22 of 28\n \n1  that direct funding for legal representation remains discretionary, conditional upon the availability \n2  of appropriations, and subject to agency determination. \n3  Even so, the Government’s argument does not address Plaintiffs’ claim.  The Government \n4  may be right that it retains some modicum of discretion related to how direct representation legal \n5  services are provided and to what degree the Government funds them; however, the Cancellation \n6  Order contravenes the Foundational Rule.  The termination of all direct representation funding is \n7  incompatible with the Foundational Rule’s requirement that the agency “shall fund” direct \n8  representation so long as funds remain available and pro bono legal services are not secured.  The \n9  Government proffers no evidence that it found pro bono counsel or even sought out alternative \n10  representation for the unaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs are prejudiced by the Government’s \n11  failure to comply with the Foundational Rule because they are inhibited in their ability to fulfill \n12  their missions of ensuring representation for unaccompanied children.  See Section II.A.1.a, above.  \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Government’s Cancellation Order thus violates the Foundational Rule, and Plaintiffs have \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  shown a likelihood of success on their APA claim under the Accardi doctrine.   \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  d.  Third Claim – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  “[T]he touchstone of ‘arbitrary and capricious’ review under the APA is ‘reasoned \nS d nr\nee 17  decisionmaking.’ ”  Altera Corp. & Subsidiaries v.

Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n19  52 (1983)).  “[A]n agency’s action can only survive arbitrary or capricious review where it has \n20  articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational connection between the \n21  facts found and the choice made.”  Alliance for the Wild Rockies v. Petrick, 68 F.4th 475, 493 (9th \n22  Cir. 2023) (citing Altera Corp. & Subsidiaries, 926 F.3d at 1080).  “Although we may uphold a \n23  decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may reasonably be discerned, we may not \n24  infer an agency’s reasoning from mere silence.”  Arrington v. Daniels, 516 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th \n25  Cir. 2008) (citations and quotation marks omitted).  As the Supreme Court has elucidated, “[a]n \n26  agency may not, for example, depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard rules that \n27  are still on the books.  And of course the agency must show that there are good reasons for the \n28  new policy,” even though it need not convince the court of the merits of its new policy.  FCC v. \n22 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 23 of 28\n \n1  Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (internal citation omitted).  Also, where an \n2  agency action rescinds a prior policy, the agency must show that it gave due consideration to \n3  “serious reliance interests.”  Id. at 515; see also Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \n4  California, 591 U.S. at 30 (“[W]hen an agency rescinds a prior policy its reasoned analysis must \n5  consider the ‘alternative[s]’ that are ‘within the ambit of the existing [policy].’ ”). \n6  Here, only two documents are proffered to provide insight into the Government’s change \n7  in position – the February 3, 2025 Secretarial Directive and the March 21, 2025 Cancellation \n8  Order.  See Biswas Decl., Ex. 1 (ECF 24-2) & Ex. 2 (ECF 24-3).8  Neither of the documents \n9  contemplates any alternatives to the existing policy of funding legal services providers for direct \n10  representation.  Cf. Regents, 591 U.S. at 30.  Neither of the documents finds any facts that would \n11  support the decision to terminate all funding, nor do they draw a rational connection between any \n12  facts considered and the decision made “for the Government’s convenience.”  Biswas Decl., Ex. 2 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  (ECF 24-3).  Rather, the Government identifies, for the first time in its opposition, a handful of \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  rationales for the decision to terminate funding for direct legal services, including “sustainability” \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  and “fiscal constraints.”  The Government contends that “ORR’s rationale, focusing on legal \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  orientation and screenings to ensure all UAC receive basic legal information, while trusting that \nS d nr\nee 17  pro bono resources (supplemented by post-release services and child advocates in special cases) \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  will provide representation in meritorious cases, is a rational strategy to fulfill its statutory \n19  obligations in a sustainable way.”  Opp. at 17; see also Opp. at 17-18 (alternatively detailing the \n20  rationale, without supporting citation, as “aligning with the TVPRA’s pro bono preference, \n21  addressing fiscal constraints, and rebalancing priorities to ensure core legal orientation and \n22  screening services reach all” unaccompanied children).  None of these rationales are evidenced in \n23  the record.  Neither of the agency documents in evidence refers to “legal orientation and \n24 \n \n25 \n8 The Government has so far refused to produce any administrative record to justify the funding \ntermination decision until it files its answer.  Amica Supp. Decl. (ECF 37-15) ¶ 13.  Moreover, \n26 \nthough the Government argues that “the administrative record here reflects a reasoned decision,” \nOpp. at 17, when pressed at the preliminary injunction hearing about the administrative record in \n27 \nthis case, the Government conceded that its briefs should refer instead to “record evidence” in the \nabsence of an administrative record.  Hr’g Tr. (ECF 83) at 22-23. \n28 \n \n23 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 24 of 28\n \n1  screenings” as a policy course to replace direct legal representation.  Moreover, those legal \n2  services are separately required by the Foundational Rule.  See 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(2) \n3  (enumerating a panoply of services an “unaccompanied child in ORR’s legal custody child shall \n4  receive”).  The Government’s interpretation essentially reads the direct legal representation \n5  contemplated in (a)(4) out of the Foundational Rule.  Further, neither of the agency documents in \n6  evidence refers to pro bono resources as a replacement for the direct legal representation available \n7  by use of congressionally earmarked funds.9  “It is a foundational principle of administrative law \n8  that judicial review of agency action is limited to the grounds that the agency invoked when it took \n9  the action.”  Regents, 591 U.S. at 20 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  The \n10  Government’s attempt to make up for its failure to provide meaningful explanation for the funding \n11  termination amounts to post hoc rationalization via attorney argument.  This is insufficient to \n12  overcome the Government’s failure to proffer any competent evidence of reasoned decision \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  making.  Though the Government characterizes this litigation as “a disagreement over policy,” \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Opp. at 19, the agencies have failed to identify any reasoned policy with which Plaintiffs could \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  disagree – there are no materials showing even the “minimal level of analysis” required under the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  APA.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 212 (2016).  On this record, the \nS d nr\nee 17  Court finds that Plaintiffs show a likelihood of success on their third APA claim for arbitrary and \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  capricious agency action.   \n19  2.  Irreparable Harm \n20  Beyond establishing a likelihood of success of the merits, plaintiffs seeking a preliminary \n21  injunction must show that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief.  \n22  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “Irreparable harm is traditionally defined as harm for which there is no \n23  adequate legal remedy, such as an award of damages.”  Arizona Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 \n24  F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014) (citation omitted).  A “showing of a mere possibility of \n25 \n \n9 Because the exclusive use of pro bono attorneys to replace government-funded direct \n26 \nrepresentation does not find any support in the record, the Court does not reach the parties’ further \ndispute regarding the viability of relying exclusively on pro bono counsel to represent \n27 \nunaccompanied children.  See Opp. at 19; Reply at 12; see also Amicus Br. Former HHS Officials \n(ECF 78) at 7-9 (describing impracticability of replacing funded direct representation with pro \n28 \nbono counsel). \n24 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 25 of 28\n \n1  irreparable harm is not sufficient under Winter.”  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 F.3d 462, 468 \n2  (9th Cir. 2010). \n3  Here, Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to suffer, if not already suffering, \n4  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief.  The Government’s termination of funding \n5  has impacted Plaintiffs, forcing them to issue layoff notices and threatening to require them to \n6  dismiss their specialized and seasoned attorneys.  See GHIRP Decl. (ECF 53-2) ¶ 3 (describing the \n7  layoff of eight staff members due to the Cancellation Order’s termination of funding).  As the \n8  Court noted in its standing analysis, the Cancellation Order prevents Plaintiffs from providing \n9  thousands of unaccompanied children with the direct representation required by the TVPRA and \n10  the Foundational Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ missions of ensuring unaccompanied children are \n11  supported by legal counsel.  See, e.g., Estrella del Paso Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-4) ¶¶ 3-4; ImmDef \n12  Supp. Decl. (ECF 53-5) ¶ 8.  Given these harms, the Plaintiff organizations “have established a \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  likelihood of irreparable harm” based on their showing of serious “ongoing harms to their \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  organizational missions,” including diversion of resources and the non-speculative loss of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  substantial funding.  Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 F.3d 1006, 1029 (9th Cir. 2013).  The \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  Government’s repetition of its arguments against standing fail to persuade.  The irreparable harm \nS d nr\nee 17  resulting from the Government’s Cancellation Order weighs in favor of a preliminary injunction. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  3.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest \n19  In deciding whether to grant an injunction, “courts must balance the competing claims of \n20  injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or withholding of the requested \n21  relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 (9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter, \n22  555 U.S. at 24).  Courts “explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the \n23  interests of the public at large.”  Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 \n24  U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Where the government is \n25  a party, the balance of equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co., 747 \n26  F.3d at 1092 (citing Nken, 556 U.S. at 435).  \n27  When the Court issued the TRO, it concluded that these third and fourth Winter factors \n28  supported enjoining the Cancellation Order.  See ECF 33 at 5-6.  The Court’s reasoning remains \n25 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 26 of 28\n \n1  intact.  The record reveals substantial, immediate, and ongoing harms to the Plaintiff \n2  organizations.  But further, as amici make clear, the risk of substantial harm to unaccompanied \n3  children as a result of not receiving counsel further weighs in favor of injunctive relief.  One group \n4  of amici, including civil rights legal organizations that represent detained immigrant children, \n5  details the important role that direct legal service providers play in recognizing and combatting the \n6  potential mistreatment of unaccompanied children in ORR custody.  See Amicus Br. of National \n7  Center for Youth Law et al. (ECF 79).  Another group of amici, former HHS officials, warns that \n8  unaccompanied children lacking counsel face greater risk of exploitation and human trafficking.  \n9  Amicus Br. of Former HHS Officials (ECF 78) at 5.  Such harms weigh in favor of injunctive \n10  relief.  The Government avers that it would suffer harm where executive branch authority is \n11  hindered, Opp. at 21-22, but the Government cites no authority that this is a factor properly \n12  considered.  Id. at 22.  Indeed, the Government’s argument fails to address the equities of granting \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  an injunction and instead merely reasserts its position that the Cancellation Order violates neither \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  the TVPRA nor the Foundational Rule.  The public interest is not served by maintaining agency \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  actions that conflict with federal law and federal agencies’ own regulations.  Valle del Sol, 732 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  F.3d at 1029 (no legitimate government interest in violating federal law).  Because the Court has \nS d nr\nee 17  concluded that the Cancellation Order likely violates the APA, the balance of equities and the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  public interest both tip decisively in Plaintiffs’ favor. \n19  4.  Bond \n20  The Government requests that the Court require Plaintiffs to post a bond as security for \n21  damages that may result from a wrongfully-granted injunction.  Opp. at 24.  In granting relief \n22  under Rule 65, “[t]he court has discretion to dispense with the security requirement, or to request \n23  mere nominal security, where requiring security would effectively deny access to judicial \n24  review.”  People of State of Cal. ex rel. Van De Kamp v. Tahoe Reg’l Plan. Agency, 766 F.2d \n25  1319, 1325 (9th Cir. 1985).  As result of the Cancellation Order, the Plaintiff organizations are \n26  unable to pay their staff and are laying some of them off.  See e.g., MIRC Decl. (ECF 37-10) ¶ 4.  \n27  Based on this record, the Court finds that requiring a bond would stifle Plaintiffs’ enforcement of \n28  their rights under the APA.  Because this litigation is brought by nonprofit organizations to protect \n26 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 27 of 28\n \n1  the public interest and ensure compliance with federal law, the Court declines the Government’s \n2  request.   \n3  5.  Scope of Relief \n4  The Government argues that any injunctive relief granted by the Court must be narrowly \n5  tailored to address only the harm suffered by these Plaintiffs and may not extend nationwide.  See \n6  Opp. at 25.  Under the APA, however, courts are required to “hold unlawful and set aside” agency \n7  action found to be invalid such that the challenged agency action no longer applies to anyone, not \n8  just the plaintiffs at bar.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Indeed, appropriate relief for successful plaintiffs in \n9  APA cases may necessarily reach nationwide.  See, e.g., Regents, 591 U.S. at 9 (holding that the \n10  rescission of a major federal program “must be vacated”); see also Lujan, 497 U.S. at 913 \n11  (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (“[I]f the plaintiff prevails, the result is that the rule is invalidated, not \n12  simply that the court forbids its application to a particular individual.”).   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  The Ninth Circuit has consistently recognized “the authority of district courts to enjoin \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  unlawful immigration policies on a universal basis.”  Regents of the Univ. of Cal. v. Dep’t of \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d 476, 511 (9th Cir. 2018) (citation omitted) (“A final principle is also \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  relevant: the need for uniformity in immigration policy.”); Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 701 \nS d nr\nee 17  (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d on other grounds, 585 U.S. 667 (2018) (“Because this case implicates \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  immigration policy, a nationwide injunction was necessary to give Plaintiffs a full expression of \n19  their rights.”); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166-67 (9th Cir. 2017) (“[A] fragmented \n20  immigration policy would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory requirement for uniform \n21  immigration law and policy.” (citing Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134, 187-88 (5th Cir. \n22  2015)).  “Such relief is commonplace in APA cases, promotes uniformity in immigration \n23  enforcement, and is necessary to provide the plaintiffs here with complete redress.”  Regents of the \n24  Univ. of Cal. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 908 F.3d at 512. \n25  In this case, there is no practical way to limit injunctive relief relating to immigration law \n26  and policy by party or by geography.  Indeed, as discussed with the Government’s declarants at \n27  the preliminary injunction hearing, there exists only one contract for the provision of the subject \n28  funding, and it applies to direct legal services nationwide.  See Hr’g Tr. at 8-9.  Moreover, the \n27 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 87     Filed 04/29/25     Page 28 of 28\n \n1  Government fails to identify any way to limit injunctive relief only to these Plaintiffs.  Nor would \n2  such fractured relief prove effective at addressing the scope of the Government’s likely violation \n3  of the APA.  The Government’s Cancellation Order had nationwide effect; the relief necessary to \n4  remedy the termination is for the Court to set aside that termination and require the Government to \n5  comply with its statutory and regulatory obligations.  Therefore, the relief granted by the Court \n6  must reach nationwide. \n7  III.  CONCLUSION \n8  For the foregoing reasons, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary \n9  injunction.  The Court ORDERS as follows: \n \n10  Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of \n11  March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), \na  12  and ORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), \ntr in particularly ORR’s provision of funds for direct legal representation \nuoro 13  services to unaccompanied children.  This injunction precludes \nCfi\n tla cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its \nciC 14  duration. \nrts fo\niD tc 15  This injunction takes effect immediately, replacing the Court’s April 1, 2025 temporary \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  restraining order (ECF 33), and will remain in place until a final judgment on Plaintiffs’ claims. \nS d nr\nee 17  Defendants shall file a status report by no later than 2:00 p.m. PST, Friday, May 2, 2025, to report \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  on compliance with the injunction.  Additional status reports regarding compliance with the \n19  injunction shall be filed no later than 2:00 p.m. PST, on May 9 and 23, 2025, and every 45 days \n20  thereafter.  This Order shall apply to the maximum extent provided for by Federal Rule of Civil \n21  Procedure 65(d)(2) and 5 U.S.C. §§ 705 and 706.  Non-compliance or delayed compliance may \n22  result in a contempt finding and sanctions. \n23  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n24  Dated: April 29, 2025 \n25   \n26     \nARACELI MARTÍNEZ-OLGUÍN \n27 \nUnited States District Judge \n28 \n28 ",

On March 21, 2025, the Department of Health and Human \nServices (“HHS”) Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) partially terminated \n$150 million in contract funds  for direct legal representation services (“direct-\nrepresentation”)  for  unaccompanied  alien  children  (“UAC”)  consistent  with  its \nexpress  statutory  authority  to  ensure  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  that \nunaccompanied alien children have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings \nand matters “at no expense to the government.” .  That contract-termination decision \nnot only reflects a core area of executive power to manage which entities perform \ncontracting functions, but also falls squarely within ORR’s express discretion to fund \ndirect-representation.   \nYet the district court enjoined that decision and is compelling the government \nto keep sending millions of taxpayer dollars out the door, with uncertain prospects \nfor  ever  recovering  those  funds  later.    Notably,  the  district  court  denied  the \ngovernment’s  request  to  stay  materially  identical  relief  at  the  TRO  stage  and \nextended that relief through the PI, leaving the government no option but to seek \nstays concurrently to prevent ongoing harm.  The injunction blatantly contravenes \nSupreme Court precedent barring the district court from exercising jurisdiction at \nall, as ten Circuit Judges recently observed in dissent from denial of rehearing en \n1 \n\n(3 of 956), Page 3 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 3 of 956\nbanc.  CLSEPA v. HHS, No. 25-2358, 2025 WL 1203167, at *1 (9th Cir. Apr. 25, \n2025) (Bumatay & VanDyke, JJ., dissenting from denial of reh’g en banc, joined by \nCallahan, Ikuta, Bennett, R. Nelson, Bade, Collins, Lee, and Bress, JJ.).  As the \nSupreme Court just held in Department of Education v. California, 145 S.Ct. 966, \n968 (Apr. 4, 2025) (per curiam), sovereign immunity bars judicial orders enforcing \n“a contractual obligation to pay money,” and plaintiffs cannot (as here) try to dress \nup breach-of-contract claims as Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) claims to \nevade that bar.  Such claims instead should be brought in the Court of Federal Claims \nunder the  Tucker Act.  As the  ten  dissenting judges explained, Department of \nEducation is “indistinguishable” from this case and presents “the same issues.”  \nCLSEPA, 2025 WL 1203167, at  *1  (dissent).   This Court need go no further: \ninjunctions that brazenly defy Supreme Court precedent warrant immediate vacatur.   \nEven if the district court had jurisdiction, the court should have rejected \nPlaintiffs’ claims given ORR’s entirely discretionary powers to decide whether to \nfund direct-representation.  The relevant statute—8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (“TVPRA”) \nmerely directs the agency to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable” that UAC \nhave counsel—“at no expense to the government”—leaving implementation to the \nagency’s discretion.  The relevant regulation—the Foundational Rule (codified at 45 \nC.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4))—is even clearer on this score, providing that even when \nfunds  are  available,  funding  for  direct-representation  is  “subject  to  ORR’s \n2 \n\n(4 of 956), Page 4 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 4 of 956\ndiscretion.”  Under the APA, decisions whether to fund such representation are thus \nclassic  matters  committed  to  agency  discretion,  because  there  is  no  judicially \nmanageable standard to second-guess the agency’s discretionary judgment about \nwhether and how to allocate resources.  Again, that independent merits problem \nshould have foreclosed relief. \nA stay is all the more warranted because the PI inflicts irreparable harm on \nthe  government.    Forcing  HHS  to  expend  taxpayer  dollars  under  a  partially \nterminated  contract—funds  the  agency  lawfully  determined  should  not  be \nexpended—causes  unrecoverable  monetary  loss  and  directly  undermines  the \nExecutive’s constitutional role in managing federal appropriations.  Meanwhile, \nPlaintiffs assert no irreparable injury of their own.  Their alleged harm is purely \nfinancial and rooted in the loss of government funding to a third-party contractor, \nbut that is no justification for injunctive relief, especially in the absence of any \nstatutory or regulatory entitlement to government-paid counsel. \nMoreover,  the  PI  raises  serious  questions  about  the  impartiality  of  the \nproceedings below.  The district judge previously held a leadership role at one of the \nnamed Plaintiff organizations and maintained a longstanding personal relationship \nwith one of Plaintiffs’ lead counsel—circumstances that call for particular caution \nwhen reviewing this injunction.  The Court should act immediately to vacate this \n3 \n\n(5 of 956), Page 5 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 5 of 956\nclearly unlawful injunction and stop the district court’s ongoing attempt to seize \ndiscretionary Executive Branch functions in violation of Supreme Court precedent.  \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs are legal services organizations that previously received federal \nfunding through a contract administered by the Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”), \nthe prime contractor for ORR’s provision of various legal services to UAC.  After \nORR elected to exercise its lawful discretion to partially terminate its contract with \nAcacia, Plaintiffs filed suit on March 26, 2025, challenging the agency’s decision.  \nSee ECF 1. \nPlaintiffs moved for emergency relief, and on April 1, 2025, the district court \nissued a TRO requiring ORR to continue funding direct-representation.  See ECF \n33.  While the TRO was still in place, the Supreme Court decided Department of \nEducation, 145 S.Ct. at 968.  In Department of Education, the Supreme Court stayed \nanother court’s TRO, and it held that claims seeking judicial orders to compel \ngovernment funding under a terminated contract are not cognizable under the APA.  \nInstead, those claims must proceed in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker \nAct.  Below, the government moved to dissolve the TRO based on this precedent.  \nSee ECF 38.  The government further moved in the district court for recusal based \non the presiding judge’s prior leadership role at Plaintiff CLSEPA and personal ties \nto its counsel.  The district court cited its need to resolve that motion as the only \n4 \n\n(6 of 956), Page 6 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 6 of 956\n“good cause” justifying extension of the TRO for another fourteen days.  Soon after, \nthe court denied the recusal motion, yet left the TRO in place.  See ECF 69. \nOn April 29, 2025, the  district court granted  Plaintiffs’ motion for a PI, \nordering ORR to continue funding direct-representation.  See ECF 87.  The PI—like \nthe TRO before it—requires HHS to continue funding notwithstanding the agency’s \nexercise of discretion to terminate the Acacia contract and redirect funds within the \nUAC Program. \nCongress vested ORR with discretion whether to fund direct-representation.  \nSee 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (authorizing ORR to provide such representation “to \nthe  greatest  extent  practicable”).    Nothing  in  the  TVPRA  or  its  implementing \nregulations mandates government-funded counsel in all circumstances.  The district \ncourt’s injunction compels the government to expend funds on a program Congress \nmade discretionary, not mandatory.  In fact, the PI does not meaningfully address \nthe TVPRA’s express incorporation of § 1362 (describing the “privilege” of direct-\nrepresentation “at no expense to the government”).  And those expenditures will very \nlikely be unrecoverable when the government prevails at the conclusion of the \nlitigation, as the court refused to require the plaintiffs to post any security under Rule \n65(c).  See ECF 87 at 27. \nThe government appealed the PI on April 30, 2025.  See ECF 88.  This motion \nseeks an immediate stay of the district court’s order, to prevent irreparable harm to \n5 \n\n(7 of 956), Page 7 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 7 of 956\nthe government and ensure that discretionary appropriations decisions remain in the \nhands of the Executive Branch while this case is resolved. \nARGUMENT \n  The government satisfies all four factors for an immediate stay of the PI: \n(1) a strong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm absent a stay; \n(3) no substantial harm to Plaintiffs if a stay is granted; and (4) that the public interest \nfavors a stay.  See Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987); Nken v. Holder, \n556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009).  The government previously sought a stay of the TRO in \nthe  district  court,  which  that  court  denied  before  entering  a  PI  extending  that \ninjunction.  This Court’s intervention is therefore essential to avoid irreparable harm \nwhile the government concurrently pursues all available avenues for relief. \nThe  district  court’s  PI  orders  the  government  to  disburse  funds  under  a \ngovernment contract, despite binding Supreme Court precedent confirming that such \nclaims cannot proceed under the APA.  Even if jurisdiction existed, Plaintiffs’ claims \nare not reviewable because the statutory and regulatory scheme makes clear that the \nagency is vested with discretion over funding for the relevant program. \nThe injunction imposes immediate and irreparable harm on the government \nby compelling unrecoverable expenditures of public funds.  And yet Plaintiffs—\nsubcontractors asserting no independent entitlement to funding—face only classic, \nremediable monetary harm.  Compounding the legal errors in the order, the district \n6 \n\n(8 of 956), Page 8 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 8 of 956\ncourt’s prior dealings with Plaintiff CLSEPA and ties to its current counsel cast \nsubstantial  doubt  on  the  appearance  of  impartiality  and  should  have  triggered \nrecusal.  The equities and public interest overwhelmingly support a stay.   \nI.  Defendants Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Appeal \nA.  The District Court Lacks Jurisdiction: Plaintiffs’ Claims Must \nProceed Under the Tucker Act. \nThis lawsuit is, at its core, an attempt to compel the government to continue \npaying money under a contract.  Plaintiffs are subcontractors that provide legal \nservices under a federal contract administered by Acacia, a prime contractor with \nHHS.  They sued after HHS partially terminated the contract, claiming entitlement \nto continued payment.  They styled their claims as APA violations and sought \ninjunctive relief.  But rebranding a contract dispute as an APA claim cannot sidestep \nCongress’s jurisdictional limits.  And subcontractors, like Plaintiffs, cannot use their \none-step-removed status to work around those limits.  Rather, under the statutory \nscheme  that  Congress  designed,  subcontractors  have  fewer  rights  than  prime \ncontractors.   \nIt is well established that “absent a clear and unequivocal waiver of sovereign \nimmunity,” the “United States and its agencies are generally immune from suit in \nfederal court.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1105 (D.C. Cir. \n2022).  Although the APA provides a limited waiver of the government’s sovereign \nimmunity for suits challenging final agency action and “seeking relief other than \n7 \n\n(9 of 956), Page 9 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 9 of 956\nmoney damages,” it does not apply “if any other statute that grants consent to suit \nexpressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  That \ncarve-out “prevents plaintiffs from exploiting the APA’s waiver to evade limitations \non  suit  contained  in  other  statutes.”    Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish  Pottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 215 (2012).   \nOne example of such an implicit limitation on APA relief involves suits \nagainst the United States that sound in contract.  The Tucker Act provides that the \n“Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment upon any claim \nagainst the United States founded” on “any express or implied contract with the \nUnited States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a).  Federal courts have thus long recognized that \n“the  Tucker  Act  ‘impliedly  forbids’”  bringing  “contract  actions”  against  “the \ngovernment in a federal district court” under the APA.  Albrecht v. Committee on \nEmp. Benefits of the Fed. Reserve Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. \n2004); see United Aeronautical Corp. v. USAF, 80 F.4th 1017, 1022 (9th Cir. 2023); \nMegapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  That barrier is mandatory.  \nIt ensures contract claims are channeled into the court with “unique expertise,” \nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. U.S., 780 F.2d 74, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1985), and which Congress \nhas generally not empowered to grant injunctive relief like specific performance, see \nJames v. Caldera, 159 F.3d 573, 580 (Fed. Cir. 1998).   \n8 \n\n(10 of 956), Page 10 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 10 of 956\nFor that reason, the Supreme Court emphasized just last month that the APA’s \nwaiver of sovereign immunity is “limited” and “does not extend to orders ‘to enforce \na contractual obligation to pay money.’”  Department of Education, 145 S.Ct. at 968 \n(quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002)); \nsee U.S. Conf. of Cath. Bishops v. DOS, No. 1:25-cv-00465, 2025 WL 763738, at *2 \n(D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025).  Further, a plaintiff cannot evade the Tucker Act by artful \npleading—the key question is the “source of rights” on which the claim is based.  \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–68.  If the only source of a plaintiff’s right to payment \nis a contract with the government, then the claim must be heard, if at all, in the Court \nof Federal Claims—not in a district court. \nHere, Plaintiffs’ asserted “rights” and injuries indisputably originate from a \nfederal contract and nowhere else.  ORR chose to fund Plaintiffs’ legal services \nthrough a contract (with a prime contractor, Acacia, which provided sub-grants to \nPlaintiffs).  No statute or regulation requires HHS to pay anyone (let alone Plaintiffs) \nto provide direct-representation.  Absent that contractual arrangement, Plaintiffs \nwould have no lawful claim to any federal funds.  If Acacia had not contracted with \nHHS to fund the services that Plaintiffs provide, Plaintiffs would have no injury to \ncomplain of.  The termination of the contract is therefore the sole cause of Plaintiffs’ \nalleged injuries.  In short, because “Plaintiffs’ lawsuit still fundamentally seeks ‘to \nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money,’ it cannot be brought under the \n9 \n\n(11 of 956), Page 11 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 11 of 956\nAPA—just as in Department of Education.”  CLSEPA, 2025 WL 1203167, at *1 \n(dissent).  Rather, the Tucker Act requires that such a claim proceed before the Court \nof Federal Claims.   \nAs the ten dissenting judges observed, the district court thus “acted without \njurisdiction” in issuing an injunction under the APA.  Id.  The APA does not convert \nfunding  interruptions  under  a  discretionary  contract  into  judicially  reviewable \nclaims.  As the dissenters explained, Department of Education confirms beyond \ndoubt that the district court lacked authority to entertain this case.  145 S.Ct. 968.  In \nthat case—which closely parallels this one—a district court enjoined the federal \ngovernment  from  terminating  certain  grant  payments,  effectively  ordering  the \ngovernment to keep paying money under a funding agreement.  Id.  The Supreme \nCourt intervened and stayed that injunction, holding that the APA cannot be used to \ncompel government payments in the guise of injunctive relief.   Id.  The Court \nemphasized that “the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders \n‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money,’” and that “the Tucker Act grants \nthe Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over” such suits.  Id. (quoting Knudson, 534 \nU.S. at 212).  Accordingly, the government was “likely to succeed in showing the \nDistrict Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.”  \nId. (citing Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87 (1974)).   \n10 \n\n(12 of 956), Page 12 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 12 of 956\nThat analysis is directly on point here.   As in Department of Education, \nPlaintiffs sued under the APA but seek what is, in substance, monetary relief—they \nasked the court to require the government to keep paying them federal funds.  And \nthe district court’s PI requires HHS to continue providing “funds for direct legal \nrepresentation services to [UAC]” through ORR’s contractor, Acacia.  ECF 87 at 28.   \nHowever,  no  semantic  reframing  can  obscure  that  the  district  court  has \nordered  the  payment  of  money  pursuant  to  a  federal  contract.    Indeed,  the \nDepartment of Education district court similarly framed its injunction as “restoration \nof the status quo” rather than an award of damages, California v. Dep’t of Educ., No. \n25-cv-10548-MJJ, 2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025), but the Court \nexamined the fundamental nature of the relief awarded, rather than the way the \ndistrict court framed that relief.   It treated an injunction “enjoining the Government \nfrom terminating . . . grants” as equivalent to ordering payment, and thus held that \nsuch relief was barred by the APA.  Department of Education, 145 S.Ct. at 968.     \nThe  district  court’s  attempt  to  distinguish  this  case  from  Department  of \nEducation based on Plaintiffs’ status as subcontractors rather than prime contractors \nhas no bite.  To be sure, it is “a hornbook rule that, under ordinary government prime \ncontracts, subcontractors do not have standing to sue the government under the \nTucker Act . . . in the event of an alleged government breach.”  Erickson Air Crane \nCo. of Wash., Inc. v. U.S., 731 F.2d 810, 813 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  That is because the \n11 \n\n(13 of 956), Page 13 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 13 of 956\n“government consents to be sued only by those with whom it has privity of contract, \nwhich it does not have with subcontractors.”  Id.  So subcontractors may proceed \nagainst the government only “through and in right of the prime contractor’s contract, \nand with the prime contractor’s consent and cooperation.”  Id.  But that does not \nmean that subcontractors can evade the Tucker Act—and its limitations on relief by \nsubcontractors—by instead suing under the APA. \nAs explained above, the APA does not “confer[] authority to grant relief if \nany other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief \nwhich is sought.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  The Tucker Act is a “statute that grants consent \nto suit”—specifically, for claims that exceed $10,000 and that are based on federal \ncontracts.  And it “forbids the relief which is sought”—relief to a subcontractor \nseparate from the prime contractor.  See Erickson, 731 F.2d at 813.  The APA \ntherefore does not provide a workaround for entities Congress chose not to grant \naccess to the Tucker Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity to instead seek the same \nrelief via the APA.  See Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1523-24 (D.C. Cir. \n1986) (“The waiver of sovereign immunity in the [APA] does not run to actions \nseeking . . . specific performance in contract cases, because . . . the Tucker Act and \nLittle Tucker Act impliedly forbid such relief.”) (citations omitted); see also Dep’t \nof Army v. Blue Fox, Inc., 525 U.S. 255, 263 (1999) (holding that the APA did not \nprovide jurisdiction over subcontractor’s claims seeking monetary relief).  Under \n12 \n\n(14 of 956), Page 14 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 14 of 956\nblack-letter law, Plaintiffs’ status as subcontractors means that they have fewer legal \nrights than prime contractors to pursue remedies under the contracts—not more.  The \ndistrict court’s contrary conclusion would turn Congress’s careful, narrow waiver of \nsovereign immunity on its head. \nThus, if this lawsuit may proceed at all, it must go forward in the Court of \nFederal Claims by and through Acacia, not in the district court as an APA action \nwithout Acacia’s involvement.  Because the district court lacked subject-matter \njurisdiction, its PI is void.  Defendants are therefore highly likely to prevail on appeal \non this threshold ground. \nB.  The Statute and Regulation Grant HHS Discretion Over Funding \nfor Direct-Representation.  \nEven if the APA did provide the district court jurisdiction, Plaintiffs’ claims \nwould still fail.   The relevant statute and regulation make clear that the agency is \nnot required to fund Acacia or the Plaintiff subcontractors, because it is instead \nvested  with  discretion  over  these  funding  decisions.    See  CLSEPA,  2025  WL \n1203167, at *1 (dissent) (“The government exercised [its] discretion [under the \nTVPRA  and  the  Foundational  Rule]  in  March  2025  to  terminate  funding”  to \nAcacia.).  HHS’s termination decision is therefore unreviewable under the APA, \nbecause the challenged action is committed to agency discretion by law.  5 U.S.C. \n§ 701(a)(2).   \n13 \n\n(15 of 956), Page 15 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 15 of 956\n “[W]here  a  statute  is  drawn  so  that  a  court  would  have  no  meaningful \nstandard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion,” the APA does \nnot authorize judicial review.  Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 600 (1988).  That is \nprecisely the case here.  Congress deliberately left the provision of government-\nfunded  counsel  to  UAC  to  the  agency’s  discretion  by  using  broad,  precatory \nlanguage and by funding the program through a lump-sum appropriation.  There is \n“no law to apply” in this context, only the agency’s policy judgments about how best \nto allocate finite child-welfare resources.  Accordingly, the APA bars courts from \nsecond-guessing  HHS’s  decision  to  reduce  or  reallocate  funding  for  direct-\nrepresentation.   \nFirst, addressing the statutory framework regarding access to counsel, the \nTVPRA provides, \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the \ngreatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362), that all [UAC] who \nare or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, and who are not described in subsection (a)(2)(A), \nhave counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and \nprotect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.  To the \ngreatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono \ncounsel  who  agree  to  provide  representation  to  such  children \nwithout charge. \n \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added).  By its plain terms, § 1232(c)(5) does not \nmandate  that  HHS  provide  or  fund  attorneys  for  UAC.    In  fact,  by  expressly \n14 \n\n(16 of 956), Page 16 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 16 of 956\nincorporating  §  1362,  the  TVPRA  is  clear  that  direct-representation  be  “at  no \nexpense to the government.”  Rather, it entrusts the agency to make practicable \nefforts to ensure UAC have legal representation, with a clear preference for pro bono \ncounsel.  See id.   \nSeveral aspects of this language confirm the discretionary nature of the task.  \nFirst, the qualifier “to the greatest extent practicable” signals that providing counsel \nfor UAC is an aspirational goal, not an absolute command.  Congress left HHS \nleeway to pursue the goal of legal representation using practicable steps, not through \nparticular mechanisms set forth by Congress.  Second, the statute explicitly ties \nHHS’s  efforts  to  what  is  “consistent  with  section  292  of  the  Immigration  and \nNationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1362).”  That cross-referenced provision guarantees that \nUAC  in  removal  proceedings  may  be  represented  by  counsel,  but  only  “at  no \nexpense to the Government.”  In other words, existing law affirmatively precludes \nany  interpretation  that  would  obligate  the  government  to  provide  counsel  at \ngovernment expense in immigration court.  By requiring consistency with § 1362, \nCongress made clear that HHS’s duty to “ensure” counsel are available should not \nbe construed as creating a right to government-funded attorneys.  Third, the section \nconcludes with Congress’s express directive that HHS must exercise its discretion \nto prefer pro bono representation over government-funded representation.   \n15 \n\n(17 of 956), Page 17 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 17 of 956\nNothing in the statute or relevant appropriation compels HHS to expend a \nparticular sum, to guarantee an attorney for each child, or to prioritize expenditures \nfor counsel over other important agency responsibilities.  The provision is instead \nframed as a general policy “to protect [children] from mistreatment, exploitation, \nand trafficking” through efforts to increase direct-representation—not as a concrete \nrule that a court may enforce in any given instance.  § 1232(c)(5).  In sum, Congress \nset an important objective, “maximize legal counsel for these children,” but also \nclarified that this be “at no expense to the government” and left the means and extent \nof achieving that objective to HHS’s discretionary judgment.  \nThe  regulations  applying  the  statute  confirm  that  understanding.    The \nFoundational Rule provides,  \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and \ninsofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, \nORR shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration \nlegal representation for certain [UAC], subject to ORR’s discretion \nand available appropriations. . . . \n \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added); see also id. at (a)(1) (“This paragraph \n(a)  describes  ORR’s  responsibilities  in  relation  to  legal  services  for  [UAC], \nconsistent  with  8  U.S.C.  1232(c)(5).”).    That  dual  condition—express  agency \ndiscretion  plus  limited  appropriations—places  these  decisions  beyond  judicial \nreview.   \n16 \n\n(18 of 956), Page 18 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 18 of 956\nThe Foundational Rule makes clear that funding for direct-representation is \nentirely subject to agency discretion.  ORR’s funding obligation comes into play \nonly  “[t]o  the  extent  ORR  determines  that  appropriations  are  available,” \ndemonstrating that at the threshold, ORR must make a discretionary assessment \nregarding the availability of limited funds within its lump-sum appropriation.  45 \nC.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  Courts are not well-positioned to review \nthat determination, which is expressly conferred on the agency.  And even if ORR \ndetermines that funds are available, and that it is not practicable to use pro bono \ncounsel, as required by statute, any provision of direct-representation is “subject to \nORR’s discretion.”  It is difficult to imagine language that more clearly vests an \nagency with discretion over a particular decision.   Far from creating a binding \nentitlement, the regulation conditions these benefits on the agency’s discretionary \nassessment as to the best allocation of resources.   \nTaken together, the TVPRA and Foundational Rule confer on the agency \nbroad  discretion  to  administer  the  UAC  Program.    They  articulate  goals  and \nauthorize spending, but do not require any specific level of funding or service.  This \nis  the  hallmark  of  a  decision  that  is  committed  to  agency  discretion.    That \nprogrammatic discretion is bolstered by ORR’s lump-sum appropriation, which \nallows the agency to decide how to allocate its funds—including whether to allocate \nany resources for direct-representation.  As the Supreme Court explained, “the very \n17 \n\n(19 of 956), Page 19 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 19 of 956\npoint of a lump-sum appropriation is to give an agency the capacity to adapt to \nchanging circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the \nmost effective or desirable way.”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993).  When \nCongress funds a program through a general appropriation, it generally “allow[s] \n[the] agency flexibility to shift funds” and set priorities within the program.  Id. at \n193.  That is exactly the case here.  Each year, Congress appropriates a single, \nflexible sum to ORR to cover competing needs—shelter/care, legal services, and \nmore.  Nothing in the appropriation or the authorizing statute earmarks a mandatory \namount for direct-representation.  It is left to ORR to determine how much of the pot \nto devote to legal services contracts, consistent with the “practicable” standard.  8 \nU.S.C. § 1232(c)(5); 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  Such budgetary decisions are \nquintessential  examples  of  matters  “committed  to  agency  discretion  by  law.”  \nLincoln, 508 U.S. at 192–93.   Just as the  agency in  Lincoln had discretion to \ndiscontinue a discretionary health service program despite a general mandate to \nserve Indian health needs, ORR retains discretion to adjust or terminate funding for \nrepresentation  without  any  legal  constraint.    There  simply  is  “no  meaningful \nstandard” in § 1232(c)(5) for a court to apply in reviewing ORR’s allocation of \nfunds.   \nThe district court mistakenly concluded that these provisions cabin HHS’s \ndiscretion, but its reasoning cannot withstand scrutiny.  The district court asserted \n18 \n\n(20 of 956), Page 20 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 20 of 956\nthat “the TVPRA mandates direct legal representation, and Congress has expressly \nappropriated funds for [those] services.”  ECF 87 at 17.  But as explained, the \nTVPRA does not mandate direct-representation paid for by the government; nor \ndoes  it  mandate  such  representation  in  every  case.    To  the  extent  it  has  any \nmandatory  effect,  it  orders  only  an  effort—to  “ensure  to  the  greatest  extent \npracticable”—not a particular outcome.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).   \nAs for the district court’s appropriations analysis, it misconceived the nature \nof a lump-sum appropriation.  Here, Congress made funds available for “services \nrequired under the TVPRA, including direct representation.”  ECF 87 at 17 (citing \nFull-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. \nA Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. \nL. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664-65 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169).  That \nis an option, not a requirement.  The district court’s citation to a Senate Report \nimplying that Congress expected ORR to use some funds for this purpose, ECF 87 \nat 3, 17, makes no difference.  Even if a subjective expectation in legislative history \ncould somehow bind an agency—which of course, it cannot—ORR’s decision to \nterminate its contract with Acacia does not indicate that ORR will not spend any \nfunds on direct-representation.  All that is at issue here is the agency’s  partial \ncurtailment of funds in light of programmatic developments or policy changes.  And \nno statute or appropriation requires the agency to continue spending at the same level \n19 \n\n(21 of 956), Page 21 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 21 of 956\nit has elected in the past.  Rather, the statute, regulations, and appropriations all \nreinforce that this program is subject to ORR’s discretion—discretion it lawfully \nexercised in terminating its contract with Acacia.  See Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 193; \nHeckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831–32 (1985).   \nOngoing legislative efforts underscore that conclusion.  After HHS terminated \nthe grant at issue here, Senators introduced a bill designed “to provide [UAC] with \nlegal representation” in immigration proceedings.  S. 1297, 119th Cong. § 301(a)(1) \n(2025),  https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/1297/text.    That \nCongress is actively debating new  legislation to guarantee  direct-representation \nconfirms that existing law imposes no such obligation.  This Court should reject \nPlaintiffs’ request to impose an obligation that Congress has so far declined to enact.   \nII.  Equitable Factors Favor a Stay \nThe injunction imposes two forms of irreparable harm on the government and \npublic, whose interests merge here.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  First, the injunction \nworks irreparable harm to the separation of powers.  Whenever a court issues a \nuniversal  injunction  against  the  Executive  Branch,  the  United  States  suffers \nirreparable harm.  The President is “a representative of the people” and holds “the \nmandate of the people to exercise his executive power.”  Myers v. U.S., 272 U.S. 52, \n123  (1926).    The  government  has  a  substantial  interest  in  implementing  the \nPresident’s policies.  Courts play an important role in adjudicating the lawfulness of \n20 \n\n(22 of 956), Page 22 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 22 of 956\nthose policies in justiciable cases, but they irreparably injure our democratic system \nwhen they forbid the government from effectuating those policies against anyone \nanywhere in the Nation.  Cf. Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, \nC.J., in chambers).  And those concerns are heightened when, as here, the injunction \nundermines  the  Executive  Branch’s  constitutional  and  statutory  authority  over \nimmigration.  Indeed, the court’s intrusion into the agency’s discretionary decision \nas to the proper allocation of funds across ORR’s areas of responsibility for services \nrequired under the TVPRA constitutes an “unwarranted judicial interference in the \nconduct of foreign policy.”  Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 116 \n(2013).  \nSetting  aside  the  separation  of  powers  and  the  government’s  sovereign \ninterests, the PI also requires the government to indefinitely disburse taxpayer funds \nthat may never be recovered.  Again, this case mirrors Department of Education, in \nwhich the Supreme Court stayed the district court’s order based on irreparable harm \nto the government.  As in that case, “[n]o grantee ‘promised to return withdrawn \nfunds should its grant termination be reinstated,’ and the District Court declined to \nimpose bond.” Department of Education, 2025 WL 1008354, at *1.  The government \nis therefore “unlikely to recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.” Id.  Here \ntoo, the district court’s injunction, issued without complying with Rule 65’s bond \n21 \n\n(23 of 956), Page 23 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 23 of 956\nrequirement, would  require the  government to pay out taxpayer funds with no \nprospect of recovering those funds if it ultimately prevails in the litigation.     \nMeanwhile, Plaintiffs are unlikely to suffer irreparable harm if the injunction \nis stayed pending appeal.  Plaintiffs have not asserted that they will have to cease \noperations if funds are withheld for the duration of the PI.  Nor have they established \nany other source of certain, immediate irreparable harm.  Indeed, the only “risk” they \nidentify—that they  might lose staff or expertise if government funding doesn’t \ncontinue—is entirely speculative and classically reparable.  Rent-A-Center, Inc. v. \nCanyon Television & Appliance Rental, Inc., 944 F.2d 597, 603 (9th Cir. 1991) \n(“economic injury alone does not support a finding of irreparable harm”).  \nThe equities weigh especially heavily in these circumstances.   The court \ndenied stay relief for the TRO and entered a PI continuing that injunction, leaving \nthe government to concurrently exhaust its remedies in both courts.  That unusual \nposture underscores why appellate intervention is warranted now.   \nFurther,  as  explained  above,  injunctions  against  the  government  work \nsubstantial  harm  to  the  public  interest  when  they  forbid  the  government  from \neffectuating the policies of democratically-elected leaders.  On top of that, the order \nat issue was entered by a judge whose background suggests serious concerns about \nthe appearance of impartiality.  The district judge in this case worked as managing \nattorney at one Plaintiff, Community Legal Services of East Palo Alto, and has a \n22 \n\n(24 of 956), Page 24 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 24 of 956\npersonal  friendship  with  Plaintiff’s  counsel.    See  ECF  47,  68.    Those  close \nrelationships  with  a  party  and  its  counsel  risk  undermining  the  appearance  of \nimpartiality.  See 28 U.S.C. § 455(a).    Equities and public interest favor a stay.  \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should stay the injunction pending appeal.   \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nYAAKOV M.

But on March 21, 2025, Defendants abruptly terminated this long-standing\nfunding for direct legal representation for these unaccompanied children.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs \nseek a temporary restraining order preventing Defendants from violating the Administrative \nProcedure Act (“APA”) by illegally ceasing funding for direct legal representation services for \nunaccompanied  immigrant  children  in  violation  of  8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(5)  and  45  C.F.R. \n§410.1309(a)(4).\nPlaintiffs request that this motion be heard on an expedited basis.

Absent intervention from legal services providers, \nthey are forced to navigate our country’s complicated immigration processes alone.  Plaintiffs are \na group of legal services providers who provide congressionally mandated legal representation and \nservices to UCs in a variety of immigration proceedings.  Recognizing the importance of this \nrepresentation, Congress has appropriated funding for them since 2012, and continuing through \nSeptember 2027.  Nonetheless, on March 21, 2025, Defendants abruptly cancelled direct legal \nrepresentation  for UCs  under the  contract effectuating  Congress’s mandate.   Without  these \ncongressionally mandated funds, Plaintiffs face the impossible choice of continuing to represent \ntheir UC clients in violation of Defendants’ order and without compensation, or abandoning their \ncore functions. \nRecognizing that children navigating complicated legal proceedings need counsel, in 2008, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them \nin legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n8  U.S.C.  § 1232(c)(5).    In  keeping  with  that  mandate,  Congress  has  funded  direct  legal \nrepresentation for UCs since 2012.  In 2024, acknowledging its responsibility to provide these \ncongressionally mandated legal  services, ORR issued its Unaccompanied Children Program \nFoundational Rule (“Foundational Rule”) and bound itself to funding legal services providers, so \nlong as congressional appropriations were available.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).   \nOn March 21, 2025, Defendants ordered an immediate stop to the representation work in \nclear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  Defendants have provided no \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 010\n\n(39 of 956), Page 39 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 39 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 34\ninformation as to how or if they will now comply with their statutory and regulatory obligations. \nDefendants have also provided no information to Plaintiffs about how they should deal with their \nongoing commitments to represent UCs (including UCs with immigration court dates as soon as \nthis week).  As a result, Plaintiffs must choose between several intolerable options:  continuing to \nrepresent their clients without compensation, drawing down precious or scarce discretionary or \nreserve funding, cutting other organizational services, laying off or terminating experienced staff, \nor seeking to withdraw from representation, thereby abandoning their child clients in the middle \nof legally complex immigration proceedings they likely cannot navigate alone.  Defendants’ \nactions are contrary to congressional and regulatory mandate and are arbitrary and capricious \nbecause they violate their own regulatory obligations.  To prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, \nto say nothing of irreparable harm to their UC clients, this Court should enjoin Defendants’ attempt \nto terminate direct legal representation for UCs under the APA.  \nThis Court should expedite consideration of this motion under 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a) and \ngrant immediate provisional relief enjoining Defendants’ illegal action, which is creating ongoing \nand irreparable harm to Plaintiffs and their clients.   \nBACKGROUND \nA. Thousands of Unaccompanied Children Rely on Legal Representation Every Year to\nExercise Their Legal Rights\nIn the 2024 fiscal year alone, nearly 100,000 new children were identified by federal \nauthorities as UCs and referred to ORR.  ORR, Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Fact Sheet \n(March 7, 2025), https://acf.gov/orr/fact-sheet/programs/uc/fact-sheet.  These children’s journeys \nto the United States may differ, but all of them are now in the United States without their parents \nor guardians.  William A. Kandel, et al., CRS Report R43628, Unaccompanied Alien Children: \nPotential Factors Contributing to Recent Immigration, at 3, 10 (2014).  Of the UCs who moved \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 011\n\n(40 of 956), Page 40 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 40 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 34\nthrough ORR custody in 2024, nearly a quarter were 12 years old or younger.  ORR, Fact Sheets \nand Data, supra. \nGiven their inherent vulnerabilities, UCs have special legal rights, see, e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§1232(a)(5)(D), including the right to apply for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the\nConvention Against Torture and voluntary departure.  Many UCs also have the right to apply for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), which offers a path to lawful permanent resident status \nbut requires state court proceedings that require counsel.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(27)(j).  UCs may \nalso pursue asylum before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in a non-adversarial process \nwithout  being  subject  to  the  one-year  filing  deadline  applicable  to  adults.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§1158(b)(3)(C).  But these rights are meaningless unless children are educated about their rights\nand equipped with the tools to exercise them, including legal counsel.  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 \n(Apr. 30, 2024).  Unaccompanied children primarily learn about and exercise their rights through \neither full legal representation or limited-scope assistance from a lawyer—often, until March 21, \n2025, an attorney funded by Defendants, and provided by Plaintiffs. \nB. Congress Has Directed HHS to Ensure Unaccompanied Children Have Legal Counsel\nCongress  has  recognized  that  UCs  are  uniquely  vulnerable  to  trafficking,  abuse  in \ngovernment custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system.  Through the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002, Congress gave Defendants Department of Health and Human Services \n(“HHS”) and ORR legal custody of UCs, with the mandate to care for the children.  See 6 U.S.C. \n§279(g)(2).  Congress also commanded Defendants HHS and ORR to “develop[] a plan to be\nsubmitted to Congress on how to ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is timely \nappointed to represent the interests of each such [unaccompanied] child.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A).  \nActing on this congressional command, in 2005, ORR developed a three-year pilot program to \nmeet the legal needs of UCs through provision of pro bono legal services.  At the end of the pilot \n3 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 012\n\n(41 of 956), Page 41 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 41 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 34\nprogram in 2008, a summary report detailed that volunteer attorneys alone were not sufficient to \nmeet  the  representation  needs  of  UCs.    See  Olga  Byrne  &  Elise  Miller,  The  Flow  of \nUnaccompanied  Children  Through  the  Immigration  System,  at  22–23  (March  2012), \nhttps://shorturl.at/KI3Jt.  The report concluded that paid attorneys would be required to cover a \nsignificant  percentage  of  the  representation  that  UCs  needed,  spurring  Congress  to  impose \nadditional representation-related requirements on ORR and HHS through the William Wilberforce \nTrafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-457, 122 Stat. 5044 \n(“TVPRA”).  \nThe TVPRA, which Congress passed in 2008 and has regularly reauthorized since then \n(most recently in 2023), mandates that HHS must provide counsel for UCs: “The Secretary of \nHealth  and  Human  Services  shall  ensure,  to  the  greatest  extent  practicable  . . .  that  all \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of the Secretary or the Secretary \nof Homeland Security . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters.”  8 \nU.S.C. §1232(c)(5) (emphasis added).  Defendants have violated this mandate. \nC. ORR’s Own 2024 Regulations Require Funding for Legal Services for Unaccompanied\nChildren Consistent with Available Appropriations.\nORR has recognized “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \nChildren Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, 2024).  On April 30, \n2024, ORR issued the final “Foundational Rule,” which codified in part HHS’s 1997 Flores \nsettlement.   Id.  Section 410.1309 of the final rule, titled “Legal Services,” affirms ORR’s position \n1 The Flores settlement, entered into by the federal government and four noncitizen children in \n1997, sets forth requirements regarding the care of UCs while in ORR custody.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34386. \n4 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 013\n\n(42 of 956), Page 42 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 42 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 34\nthat “legal services providers who represent unaccompanied children undertake an important \nfunction” and  explains  ORR’s goal  of “100 percent  legal  representation of unaccompanied \nchildren.”  Id. at 34526.   \nThe Foundational Rule requires that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund \nlegal  service  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children.”2  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  To comply with the TVPRA and the \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  the  rule  recognizes  ORR  must  “ensure  that  all \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \nthat “[t]o the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not \npracticable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service providers to provide \ndirect immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s \ndiscretion and available appropriations.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), (d).   \n2 Congress has also required ORR to compile and provide lists of legal services providers \n“qualified  to  provide  guardian  and  attorney  representation  services”  for  UCs.    6  U.S.C. \n§279(b)(1)(I).  The Foundational Rule also binds ORR to working with qualified legal services\nproviders to provide orientations and consultations for UCs.  (a)(2)(i)(A).\n5 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 014\n\n(43 of 956), Page 43 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 43 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 34\nrelease services . . . including . . . access to legal services.”  Id. at 168.  Finally, the Senate Report \nexpressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund counsel for UCs:  “The \nCommittee also expects these funds will be used to provide access to counsel, consistent with the \ngoals of the [TVPRA] of 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration \nproceedings.”  Id. at 169.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the same levels for \nUC legal representation.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. \nL.119-4, div. A, tit. I, § 1101(8) (2025)).  From December 2023 until March 21, 2025, Defendants\nsatisfied this obligation through contracting with Acacia Center for Justice, who contracted with \norganizations like Plaintiffs to provide direct legal representation for unaccompanied children. \nD. Defendants Terminate Funding for Direct Legal Representation for Unaccompanied\nChildren.\nDespite Congress’s consistent funding of legal representation for UCs as mandated by the \nTVPRA, Defendants’ actions undermine congressional appropriations, the TVPRA’s mandate, \nand ORR’s Foundational Rule.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent a letter titled “Notice of \nPartial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” (the “Cancellation Order”) to the Acacia \nCenter for Justice, the prime contractor on this contract, who then notified Plaintiffs of the \ntermination.  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for direct legal \nrepresentation for UCs—both in and out of ORR’s custody—as of close of business that day, \nignoring the requirement to fund these programs under the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  \nThe letter further commanded the Plaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on any of the active \nrepresentations of UCs and to stop taking on new engagements.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; VAAP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Up until the March 21 letter, Defendants enabled legal services providers, including \nPlaintiffs, consistently to provide direct and ongoing representations to tens of thousands of UCs \nin proceedings, including removal and SIJS proceedings.  The letter provided no explanation for \n6 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 015\n\n(44 of 956), Page 44 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 44 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 34\nthe termination nor guidance on how to handle existing representations, including those with \nimminent court hearings.  Defendants were silent as to whether providers could continue existing \nrepresentations (unfunded), despite the stop-work direction, or must withdraw immediately and (if \ngranted) be forced to leave their clients in the lurch.  See NWIRP Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11; VAAP Decl. ¶¶ \n12, 13, 21; Estrella Decl. ¶¶ 13, 16; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 19.  \nThis is not the first time that Defendants have acted to halt the legal representation of \nunaccompanied children.  About a month earlier, on February 18, 2025, Defendant Department of \nthe Interior (“DOI”) and Defendant HHS issued an “Immediate Stop Work Order,” ordering legal \nservices providers—including Plaintiffs—to indefinitely “cease all services” and “stop all work” \nfor active legal services.  NWIRP Decl. ¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; MIRC Decl. ¶ 21; Public Counsel \nDecl. ¶ 10; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11.  Although Defendants rescinded the stop work \norder three days later, Defendants’ drastic actions spurred 32 Senators to sign a letter expressing \n“strong opposition” to the stop work order and noting its violation of the TVPRA.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 9; VAAP Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 11; see Senator Mazie K. Hirono, \nLetter to HHS and Interior on Legal Services for Children in Immigration System (March 3, 2025), \nhttps://shorturl.at/RcUr3. \nDespite this strong opposition and TVPRA’s mandate, Defendants terminated funding on \nMarch 21, 2025, and have further provided no information about whether or how they intend to \nreplace these critical legal services for UCs.  Terminating funding for these legal services has \ndevastating and irreparable effects on Plaintiffs, which are all the more devastating for the harm \nthey will do to UCs.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 7.  For example, VAAP previously furloughed two of its \nthree direct legal service practitioners on staff after the February stop work order, leaving the \nremaining practitioner to bear two additional full caseloads at a time.

See Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co., Inc. v. John D. Brush & Co., Inc., 240 \nF.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) (explaining the analysis for a TRO and preliminary injunction\nare “substantially identical”).  A temporary restraining order is warranted where the plaintiffs \nestablish:  (1) their likelihood of success on the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) the balance of \nequities tips in their favor; and (4) that an injunction is in the public interest.  All. for the Wild \nRockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) (citing Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)); see also Stuhlbarg, 240 F.3d at 839 n.7 (applying preliminary injunction \nstandard to a temporary restraining order).  Where the government is the defendant, the last two \nfactors merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nARGUMENT \nAgency action cannot stand if it is contrary to law.  Because Defendants’ termination of\ndirect  legal  representation services is  contrary to  the TVPRA and ORR’s own  regulations, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n8 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 017\n\n(46 of 956), Page 46 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 46 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 34\nA. The Cancellation Order Determines Plaintiffs’ Legal Rights and Obligations and is\nFinal Agency Action Reviewable Under the APA.\nThe APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public \nand their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 \n(1992).  Persons or organizations, like Plaintiffs here, who are “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, [are] entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “[A]gency action” includes not \nonly agencies’ affirmative acts, but also their omissions and failures to act.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. § 551(13). \nUnder the APA, this Court may set aside and enjoin unlawful agency action, and compel \nagency action unlawfully withheld, if it is a (1) “final agency action,” (2) “for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court,” so long as (3) there are no “statutes [that] preclude judicial \nreview” and “agency action is [not] committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), \n704. Plaintiffs satisfy each of these criteria here, and APA relief is therefore proper.\nFinal Agency Action.  Under the APA, “agency action” is defined as “the whole or a part\nof an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to \nact.”  5 U.S.C. § 551(13); 5 U.S.C. § 701(b)(2).  An agency action is final where two conditions \nare satisfied: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking \nprocess,” and (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or \nfrom which legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) \n(quotation marks and citations omitted). \nDefendants’ refusal to fund or otherwise provide direct legal representation for UCs is a \nfinal agency action.  See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (attempt to “pause” funding and disbursements constituted final agency \naction).  Immigrant Defenders Law Center v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security, No. 2:21-\n9 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 018\n\n(47 of 956), Page 47 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 47 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 34\ncv-00395, Dkt. 304 (C.D. Cal. Mar. 14, 2025), is instructive.  In that case, plaintiffs alleged that\nthe Department of Homeland Security unlawfully denied the rights guaranteed by the TVPRA \nfrom unaccompanied children who had previously been processed under the Department of \nHomeland Security’s Migrant Protection Protocols Policy (“MPP”), despite having entered and \nbeen designated as UCs.  Id. at *21–22.  The court held that plaintiffs met the first requirement \nbecause “nothing in the record indicates that the Policy is tentative or that decisionmaking is \nongoing.”  Id. at *18. As to the second, the court found the policy at issue was final because it was \n“an agency action ‘from which legal consequences will flow.’”  Id. at *19 (quoting Bennett, 520 \nU.S. at 178). \nHere, Defendants clearly ceased funding direct legal representation to UCs in violation of \nan express statutory mandate and their own regulatory frameworks.  The Cancellation Order \ndirected Plaintiffs to stop all work providing direct legal representation to UCs, including existing \nclients whom Plaintiffs undertook to represent before the Cancellation Order.  This notification is \nfinal:  it terminates all funding for and orders a halt to all direct legal representation, leaving only \nfunding for certain Know Your Rights (“KYR”) presentations and confidential legal consultations.  \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 13; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 10; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. ¶ 11.  That order went \ninto effect immediately on March 21, 2025. \nAs a result, Plaintiffs are forced to choose between continuing to provide unfunded legal \nrepresentation  in  the  face  of  extremely  limited  resources;  cutting  other  vital  organizational \nprograms, laying off, furloughing, or terminating staff; or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing \nrepresentation duties for court hearings, client meetings, and other important preparations for legal \nproceedings as soon as this week.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21.  The longer Plaintiffs go without this funding \nor clarity regarding how to handle their current clients, the fewer services they can provide as they \n10 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 019\n\n(48 of 956), Page 48 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 48 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 20 of 34\nare forced to withdraw from ongoing representations, cut other core programs, and/or lay off or \nreassign staff.  VAAP Decl. ¶ 20–22; NWIRP Decl. ¶ 14.  Institutional knowledge will be \npermanently lost if significant numbers of experienced staff are laid off, irreparably damaging the \nPlaintiffs’ capabilities, regardless of whether funding is ever reinstated.  Thus, this termination \nundeniably has an immediate effect on parties’ rights or obligations.  \nNo Other Adequate Remedy.  Plaintiffs do not have any other adequate remedy for their \nclaims.  The Supreme Court narrowly interprets the “other adequate remedy” limitation, stressing \nthat it “should not be construed to defeat the central purpose of providing a broad spectrum of \njudicial review of agency action.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 903 (1988); see also \nChang v. United States, 327 F.3d 911, 923 (9th Cir. 2003) (“generous” APA review provisions \nmust be given “hospitable” interpretation (citing Abbott Labs v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140, 141 \n(1967))).  Instead, “Congress intended by that provision simply to avoid duplicating previously \nestablished special statutory procedures for review of agency actions.”  Darby v. Cisneros, 509 \nU.S. 137, 146 (1993).  Here, no such special procedures have been established.   \nNo Statutory Bar to Review.  Finally, no statute bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims here, and \nCongress has done nothing to override “the strong presumption that Congress intends judicial \nreview”  of  the  administrative  actions  Plaintiffs  challenge.    Bowen  v.  Mich.  Acad.  of  Fam. \nPhysicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986). \nB. Termination of the Legal Representation Programs Violates the TVPRA.\nUnder the TVPRA, Congress requires that the government “shall ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and \nto  “protect  them from  mistreatment,  exploitation,  and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  \nCanceling funding for and ordering stoppage of direct legal representation services to UCs violates \n11 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 020\n\n(49 of 956), Page 49 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 49 of 956\nan express congressional mandate.  The Cancellation Order should be held unlawful and set aside.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(a)(2)(A).  \nThe TVPRA, requiring Defendants to “ensure [UC legal representation] to the greatest \nextent  practicable,”  precludes  them  from  terminating  the  legal  representation  program  and \nnullifying its congressionally appropriated funding under circumstances here.  See, e.g., Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 655075, at *18 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (government agencies violated the \nAPA when they withheld appropriated funds when agencies were “required, ‘to the extent of \navailable  appropriations,’  to  ensure  provision  of  support  services  for  resettled  refugees”).  \nDefendants terminated this funding and ordered Plaintiffs to cease UC client representation \nwithout providing any other avenues of legal services for UCs—failing to “ensure, to the greatest \nextent practicable,” that UCs have legal counsel in their immigration proceedings.  Defendants’ \nCancellation Order effectively ends meaningful legal representation for UCs by Plaintiffs and \nforecloses other providers from providing similar legal representation.  VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 20–21. \nAlthough the TVPRA grants Defendants some discretion in how to allocate appropriated \nfunds for legal access, Defendants cannot simply cease funding for direct legal representation in \nits entirety.  See Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18.  That is precisely what happened here: \nDefendants cut off funding for direct legal representation services without providing any guidance \nor explanation to Plaintiffs regarding how they should deal with their ongoing representations and \nwithout any alternative plan for implementing their duties under the statute.  Amica Decl. Ex. 3. \nUltimately, canceling the programs defies express congressional mandates in both the \nTVPRA and appropriations bills.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. \n118-47, § 4, 130 Stat. 460, 461 (incorporating the explanatory statement published at  170\nCongressional Record H1501-01, which in turn incorporates Senate Report No. 118-84).  Out of \n12 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 021\n\n(50 of 956), Page 50 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 50 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 22 of 34\nthe $5,506,258,000 the Senate Report specified for the UCP, the Report recommended “no less \nthan the fiscal year 2023 funding level for post-release services; legal services and access to \ncounsel; and child advocates,” and that such “funds will be used to provide access to counsel, \nconsistent with the goals of the [TVPRA].”  S. Rep. 118-84 at 167–70 (2023) (emphases added).   \nAfter mandating in the TVPRA that Defendants provide legal representation to UCs “to \nthe greatest extent practicable,” Congress facilitated the provision of legal representation by \nappropriating billions of dollars to the UCP program, which includes (among other services) direct \nlegal representation to UCs.  By consistently appropriating funds for this program for more than a \ndecade, Congress not only ensured that it would be practicable to provide legal representation to \nUCs, but also expressly intended to ensure this outcome.  Given that appropriations are available \nto fund access to direct legal representation, Defendants cannot, consistent with their TVPRA \nobligations, simply refuse to fund such representation.   \nC. Terminating the Legal Representation Programs Violates the ORR Foundational Rule.\nThe government also is “bound by the regulations it imposes upon itself.”  See United \nStates v. 1996 Freightliner Fld Tractor VIN1FUYDXYB-TP822291, 634 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. \n2011).  “Where the rights of individuals are affected, it is incumbent upon agencies to follow their \nown procedures.”  Morton v. Ruiz, 415 U.S. 199, 235 (1974).  Under the Accardi doctrine, parties \nmay bring claims under the APA asserting that an agency has failed to follow its own rules and \ninternal policies.  See, e.g., Alcaraz v. I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  Accardi \nconcerned the failure by the Board of Immigration Appeals to exercise its independent discretion \nin deciding an appeal as required by the agency’s own regulations.  See United States ex rel. \nAccardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266–67 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds.    \n13 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 022\n\n(51 of 956), Page 51 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 51 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 23 of 34\nOtro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024) (plaintiffs \nsufficiently alleged a policy violation based on a rule preamble and alleged substantial hardship \nbased on border turnback policy); see also Carnation Co. v. Sec’y of Lab., 641 F.2d 801, 804 n.4 \n(9th Cir. 1981) (the standard for an Accardi violation is “whether violation of the regulation \nprejudiced the party involved”).  Here, Defendants’ actions violate their express commitment in \nthe Foundational Rule, a binding regulation, to fund legal services providers to provide UC legal \nrepresentation as long as appropriations are available.  Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced \nbecause they rely on that funding to provide critical legal services to UCs and will, in some cases, \nbe forced to stop providing that representation to their UC clients.  Plaintiffs will have to choose \nbetween financial survival and adhering to binding ethical obligations as to existing clients if \nDefendants’ actions are not enjoined.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 14; Estrella Decl. ¶ 15; see also infra \nSection II.A.  \nORR has “recognize[d] that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. at \n34529; see also Al Otro Lado, 2024 WL 4370577, at *9 (preambles may sufficiently bind agencies \nunder Accardi).  Accordingly, ORR just last year stated its intention to provide “universal legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children by FY 2027.”  HHS: Administration for Children & \nFamilies,  Justification  of  Estimates  for  Appropriations  Committees,  at  78  (2024), \nhttps://shorturl.at/4VDSL; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 34526 (“ORR strives for 100 percent legal \nrepresentation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to the extent \npossible.”).  Thus, in 2024, ORR adopted the Foundational Rule, which states in relevant part: \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is \nnot practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service \n14 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 023\n\n(52 of 956), Page 52 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 52 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 34\nproviders  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations. \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  ORR explicitly noted that “in some cases it is \nimpracticable for ORR to secure pro bono legal services for unaccompanied children,” and \nprovided that ORR would fund legal services with available congressional appropriations for those \ncases.  89 Fed. Reg. at 34529.  The Foundational Rule thus explicitly obligates ORR to fund legal \nservices providers to provide direct immigration legal representation, so long as congressional \nappropriations are available and pro bono counsel is not practicable.  See id. at 34529 (“ORR has \ndetermined that its approach to providing legal services to unaccompanied children by enabling \nthem to access pro bono counsel ‘to the greatest extent practicable’ and funding legal services for \nadditional  unaccompanied  children,  as  resources  allow,  is  consistent  with  ORR’s  statutory \nobligations.”).  \nDefendants’ actions on March 21, 2025, subvert these ORR commitments and regulations, \nviolate the Accardi doctrine, and are both contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious under the \nAPA.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 411 F. Supp. 3d 1036, 1068–69 (C.D. Cal. \n2019).  Congressional appropriations are readily available until September 2027 to fund these legal \nservices, including funds appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025.  See, e.g., Full-Year \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) \n(2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. \n460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  Nonetheless, without explanation and without a plan \nto replace these critical legal services, the Cancellation Order violates Defendants’ obligations and \nhas caused and will continue to cause Plaintiffs substantial hardship, as described below.  See also \ninfra Section II.A.  Because Defendants’ actions violate their own stated policies and substantially \nprejudice Plaintiffs, the termination order should be enjoined.   \n15 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 024\n\n(53 of 956), Page 53 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 53 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 25 of 34\nII. Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements for Injunctive Relief\nA. Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm\nA temporary restraining order is appropriate where, as here, the moving party shows that \nit faces irreparable harm—harm which is (1) “immediate”, Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. \nBaldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988), and (2) “for which there is no adequate legal remedy.”  \nAriz. Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nHere, immediate injunctive relief is necessary to protect Plaintiffs from suffering severe \nand irreparable harm.  Defendants’ abrupt termination of funding for direct legal representation \ndirectly interferes with Plaintiffs’ missions, immediately impeding their ability to provide critical \nlegal representation that is at the heart of Plaintiffs’ core activities.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 22; VAAP \nDecl.  ¶¶ 21–22;  NWIRP  ¶¶  13–15.    There  is  no  question  that  ceasing  funding  for  legal \nrepresentation services for UCs and terminating the existing services will cause imminent harm \nthat cannot be later remediated.  MIRC Decl. ¶ 32–33; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 37.  The Cancellation Order \nprevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of unaccompanied children with the direct legal \nrepresentation  required  under the TVPRA and the Foundational  Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ \n16 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 025\n\n(54 of 956), Page 54 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 54 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 26 of 34\nprimary mission of representing these children as contemplated by Congress and the TVPRA.  See, \ne.g., ImmDef Decl. ¶ 2.  If this occurs, “‘there can be no do over and no redress.’”  League of\nWomen Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting League of Women Voters \nof N.C. v. North Carolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014)).   \nPlaintiffs have relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding for these \ncritical resources will continue to be available.  Amica Decl. ¶ 11; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 18.  Cutting \noff this vital resource threatens immediate and irreparable harm.  See, e.g., CLSEPA Decl. ¶ 13; \nVAAP Decl. ¶¶ 22–24; KIND Decl. ¶¶ 16–19.  For example, Immigrant Defenders Law Center \nhas already had to provide 27 staff with layoff notices in response to the Cancellation Order and \nanticipates additional cuts would be necessary if funding is not restored; these staff losses threaten \nits ability to continue representing the 1900 UCs it currently represents.  ImmDef Decl. ¶¶ 20–22. \nIn Texas, Estrella del Paso currently manages 324 pending cases and predicts the loss of funding \nwill require staff layoffs and increase caseloads for existing staff.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6.  The \nGalveston-Houston Immigration Representation Project expects to lay off most of their Immigrant \nChildren and Youth staff within four weeks.  GHIRP Decl. ¶ 21.  Sustaining these services without \nthis funding will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.  NWIRP Decl. \n¶ 13.  Private providers predict devastating financial consequences, including the potential for \nbankruptcy.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 19; MM Decl. ¶ 18.  And these losses do not even account for the \norganizational knowledge at risk of being lost.  Estrella Decl. ¶ 6; FIRRP Decl. ¶ 38; Amica Decl. \n¶ 25; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 21.     \nThese  harms  cannot  be  remediated  or  redressed,  even  if  Defendants  later  provide \nalternative routes for providing direct legal representation for UCs.  The harm to Plaintiffs and \ntheir clients is imminent and irreparable.  The termination of services took effect immediately upon \n17 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 026\n\n(55 of 956), Page 55 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 55 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 27 of 34\nreceipt of Defendants’ letter on March 21, 2025, which provided no guidance as to what Plaintiffs \nshould do with their existing obligations, including immigration court hearings scheduled for this \nweek.  DHCC Decl. ¶ 15; Amica Decl. ¶ 20; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs have ethical obligations \nto their clients and cannot simply immediately withdraw from representation; indeed, most \nattorneys will require court permission to withdraw.  FIRRP ¶ 34.  Plaintiffs and their clients are \nalready experiencing irreparable harm far exceeding the mere loss of funding, including because \nthey have to furlough or layoff staff and increase the caseloads of staff who can stay on.  After \nlimited reserves run out, Immdef will be forced “to take drastic action to terminate staff across all \npositions  funded  under  this  contract.”  Immdef  Decl.  ¶  21.    Similarly,  KIND  “anticipate[s] \nsignificant layoffs, starting within days” after the termination of funding.  KIND ¶ 16.  Children’s \nimmigration cases “are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly skilled attorneys \nto competently handle them.”  Id. at ¶ 23. Impacted attorneys and staff have years of individualized \nexperience and wisdom with clients, making rehiring after layoffs impracticable.   \nThe imminent potential harms to children are immediate and severe.  For example, “if a \nchild at one of the ORR-subcontracted facilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal \nneed such as an outstanding removal order, Amica Center—the only legal provider with access to \nthe ORR-subcontracted facility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to \nprotect the child from imminent removal.”  Amica Decl. ¶ 21.  Further, “[a]t this very moment, \nthere are children in ORR custody who need our representation who are not receiving it.  This \nmeans that children who want voluntary departure will have their return home unacceptably \ndelayed, victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections they deserve, and children \nfleeing persecution will not be able to have their day in court.”  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 25.  The Court \n18 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 027\n\n(56 of 956), Page 56 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 56 of 956\ncannot later reset the clock.  Absent a temporary restraining order Plaintiffs will suffer harm that \ncannot later be fixed.  \nB. The Balance of Equities\nFinally, in considering whether to grant a temporary restraining order, the Court should \n“balance the competing claims of injury and . . . consider the effect on each party of the granting \nor withholding of the requested relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 \n(9th Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)).  Where an \ninjunction will not “substantially injure the other [interested] parties,” the balance of equities tips \nin plaintiffs’ favor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434. \nHere, there will be no harm to Defendants if this Court issues a temporary restraining order: \nthe Government “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Instead, “there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”  State v. Azar, 385 F. Supp. \n3d 960, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds and remanded sub nom. California ex rel. \nBecerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Newby, 838 F.3d at 12) (cleaned up). \nTerminating funding for direct legal representation for UCs, without any plan to ensure \nthat current representations are not interrupted, violates Congress’s express directive in the \nTVRPA and ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.  Enjoining Defendants from \neffectively terminating these services merely prevents Defendants from defying these mandates \nand shirking their own voluntarily undertaken obligations.  Paying out funds already appropriated \nfor these services cannot harm Defendants in any meaningful way compared to the harms that \nPlaintiffs and their clients will suffer if this Court does not issue a temporary restraining order.   \n19 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 028\n\n(57 of 956), Page 57 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 57 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 29 of 34\nMaintaining funding for these direct legal representation services furthers critical public \ninterests: ensuring children have access to legal representation and protection from trafficking, as \nwell as promoting efficiency and fairness within the immigration system for thousands of children \nwho have viable claims for immigration relief in the United States.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 34529 \n(recognizing benefit of UC representation to the immigration system generally).  Plaintiffs’ work \nwith UCs is widely recognized and commended by the legal community writ large, including by \nImmigration Judges, clerks, and the Department of Homeland Security’s field office staff.  VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 11; MIRC Decl. ¶ 19; ImmDef Decl. ¶ 13. The programs promote judicial economy by \npreventing immigration courts from bearing expenses such as unnecessary status conferences, \nVAAP Decl. ¶ 11, terminating proceedings for children where jurisdiction is improper, VAAP \nDecl. ¶ 9; RMIAN Decl. ¶ 10, and efficiently funneling contact with the courts through a single \npoint of contact rather than having 50 or more representatives reaching out individually, MIRC \nDecl. ¶ 19.  Plaintiffs play a key role in ensuring that children’s needs are being met while in ORR \ncustody.  ImmDef Decl. ¶ 8.  For example, Plaintiffs make referrals to Child Advocates, advocate \ndirectly with ORR to avoid unnecessary “step ups” for children at risk of being placed in more \nrestrictive detention settings, and request Trafficking Victim designations from the Office of \nTrafficking in Persons.  Id.  Because Plaintiffs are independent, non-governmental organizations, \nchildren often share concerns with Plaintiffs they do not feel comfortable sharing with ORR-\nsubcontracted staff or other stakeholders.  Id.  A temporary restraining order enjoining the \nCancellation Order is in the public interest.   \nIf the Court does not issue a temporary restraining order, Plaintiffs and the thousands of \nUCs they represent will face clear, immediate, and irreparable harms.  Defendants themselves, \nmeanwhile, do not face any injury from the issuance of a temporary restraining order to stop their \n20 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 029\n\n(58 of 956), Page 58 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 58 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 30 of 34\nillegal action.  Given these considerations, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of \nissuing a temporary restraining order here. \nIII. A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate\nWhile injunctive relief must be tailored to the scope of the case, “there is no bar against . . . \nnationwide relief in federal district or circuit court when it is appropriate.”  Bresgal v. Brock, 843 \nF.2d 1163, 1170 (9th Cir. 1987).  Moreover, “an injunction is not necessarily made over-broad by\nextending benefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in the lawsuit—even if it is \nnot a class action—if such breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they \nare entitled.”  Id. at 1170–71.  Accordingly, “when a reviewing court determines that agency \nregulations are unlawful, the ordinary result is that the rules are vacated—not that their application \nto the individual petitioners is proscribed.”  E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640,681 \n(9th Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  The appropriate injunctive relief “often depend[s] as much on the \nequities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.”  Trump v. Int’l. Refugee \nAssistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 579–80 (2017).   \nHere, because “the scope of injunctive relief is dictated by the extent of the violation \nestablished, not by the geographical extent of the plaintiff,” a nationwide injunction is necessary \nto provide Plaintiffs complete relief.  See Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979); Doe #1 \nv. Trump, 957 F.3d 1050, 1069 (9th Cir. 2020) (nationwide scope of injunction proper to provide\ncomplete relief).  Defendants’ decision to terminate direct legal representation directly violates the \nTVPRA and the Foundational Rule as to every legal services provider and will cause irreparable \nharm if allowed to proceed.  A nationwide injunction is the only way to effectively grant Plaintiffs \nthe relief they seek: the preservation of their mission to provide critical legal services for UCs \nacross the country who would otherwise be left to navigate the immigration system alone.  It is \nalso the only way to ensure that Defendants comply with the congressional mandate and their own \n21 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 030\n\n(59 of 956), Page 59 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 59 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 31 of 34\nregulatory obligations to provide legal representation to UCs to the greatest extent practicable \nWithout a nationwide injunction, Defendants may continue to deny funding to other nonprofit \norganizations providing similar services, preventing thousands of UCs from  receiving legal \nrepresentation and assistance, and forcing Plaintiffs to make an impossible choice between serving \ntheir mission unfunded or turning their backs on vulnerable clients.  Plaintiffs, whose primary \nmission and core organizational activities include critical direct legal representation for these \nchildren, will be forced to either deplete their reserves by continuing to provide as much direct \nlegal representation services as possible or turn their backs on vulnerable clients.  Notably, \nDefendants—who, consistent with congressional appropriations, already allocated funding for \ndirect legal representation—will not face any harm from a nationwide injunction requiring them \nto continue funding legal representation as planned.  Thus, the balance of equities weighs heavily \nin favor of a nationwide injunction. \nCourts have recognized that “a fragmented immigration policy would run afoul of the \nconstitutional and statutory requirement for uniform immigration law and policy.”  Washington v. \nTrump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2017).  “For these reasons, in immigration cases, [this \nCourt] consistently recognize[s] the authority of district courts to enjoin unlawful policies on a \nuniversal basis.” E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681 (quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nMoreover,  plaintiffs  are  located  throughout  the  country,  and  “[d]ifferent  interpretations  of \nexecutive policy across circuit or state lines will needlessly complicate agency and individual \naction,” see E. Bay Sanctuary, 993 F.3d at 681, and piecemeal injunctive relief for the more than \n80 providers nationwide would be impractical and difficult to administer.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, \n985 F.3d 309, 326–27 (4th Cir. 2021).  Accordingly, a nationwide injunction is appropriate in this \ncase.  \n22 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 031\n\n(60 of 956), Page 60 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 60 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 32 of 34\nIV. Plaintiffs Seek Expeditious Resolution of their Claims\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1657(a), courts “shall expedite the consideration of any action . . . if \ngood cause therefor is shown.”  Actions for preliminary or temporary injunctive relief “are named \nthe highest priority civil actions,” and “special consideration” should be given to “actions asserting \nfederal rights.”  Freedom Commc’ns Inc. v. F.D.I.C., 157 F.R.D. 485, 486 (C.D.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.   \n \n1.  My name is Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu. I am a licensed attorney and a member in good \nstanding in the State Bar of Arizona. I am currently employed as Deputy Director of the \nFlorence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (“Florence Project” or “FIRRP”). I joined \nthe Florence Project on September 6, 2016, and have served in my current role since \nSeptember 2024. Before I assumed my current position, I previously served as Children’s \nLegal Program Manager, Managing Attorney for the Children’s Pro Bono Program, Pro \nBono Mentor, Staff Attorney, and Law Graduate with the Florence Project's Children’s \nLegal Program serving unaccompanied immigrant children in Arizona.  During my time \nat the Florence Project, I have personally provided free legal services, including friend of \ncourt services, direct representation, legal orientation and education, and pro bono \nmentorship, to at least 140 children. Additionally, as Children’s Legal Program Manager \nand Deputy Director I have supervised attorneys, pro bono volunteer attorneys, law \ngraduates, accredited representatives, legal assistants, intake specialists, and social \nworkers who have provided free legal services, both direct representation and pro se \nservices, to thousands of individuals detained in Office of Refugee Resettlement “ORR” \nand ICE custody in Arizona. \n \nFlorence Project’s Mission and Scope\n \n2.  Founded in 1989, the Florence Project is a 501(c)(3) non-profit legal services \norganization with offices in Tucson, Phoenix, and Florence, Arizona. The Florence \nProject’s mission is to provide free legal and social services to detained adults and \nchildren facing immigration removal proceedings in Arizona. On any given day, there are \nthousands of people detained and facing deportation proceedings in Arizona, including \nadults in rural detention centers in Eloy and Florence, Arizona and unaccompanied \nchildren who are or were previously in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(“ORR”) in shelters in the Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. With no public \ndefender structure in immigration removal proceedings, the vast majority of people \nfacing removal are forced to go unrepresented in immigration court due to poverty or lack \nof access to counsel, this includes unaccompanied children who are in the country \nwithout a parent or legal guardian. The Florence Project’s vision is to ensure that all \nimmigrants facing removal have access to counsel, understand their rights under the law, \nand are treated fairly and humanely. \n \n3.  The Florence Project is the sole 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to providing \nfree immigrant legal services to unaccompanied children in Arizona. Through our \nattorneys, accredited representatives, law graduates, intake specialists, legal assistants, \nsocial workers, and network of pro bono attorneys, the Florence Project provides free \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 042\n\n(71 of 956), Page 71 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 71 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 19\nlegal education and free representation and social services to thousands of \nunaccompanied children who are facing deportation proceedings in Arizona.  \n \nFlorence Project’s Services Under the Unaccompanied Children’s Program \n \n4.  The Florence Project began providing legal services to unaccompanied children who \nwere detained and facing deportation proceedings in Arizona in 2000. At the time, \nunaccompanied children were detained in the custody of the former Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, (“INS”), the same agency that managed adult immigration \ndetention and removal, in jail-like facilities in Central Arizona. Those facilities were ill-\nequipped to manage the special needs of children and children regularly suffered harmful \ntreatment–for example, routine strip searches before attorney visits, prolonged detention, \nplacement in solitary confinement, and other restraints. In 2002 as part of the general \nrestructuring of immigration enforcement under the Homeland Security Act, and in \nrecognition of the special needs of children, Congress moved away from the adult \ndetention model and transferred the care and custody of unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren to the Office of Refugee Resettlement “ORR”. At or about that same time, \nchildren began to be detained in shelter facilities in the Phoenix area. The Florence \nProject subsequently opened an office in Phoenix to better facilitate serving these \nunaccompanied child clients. In 2014, ORR opened additional shelters in the Tucson area \nand, again, the Florence Project opened a Tucson office to serve those clients. The \nFlorence Project has continuously served unaccompanied children detained in Arizona \nsince 2000.     \n \n5.  As it pertains to unaccompanied children, in order to carry out our mission of providing \nfree legal and social services to unaccompanied children facing removal proceedings in \nArizona, the Florence Project’s Children’s Legal Program and Children’s Social Services \nTeam has a number of main work components that involve providing unaccompanied \nchildren with legal education and know your rights presentations, legal screenings, legal \nadvocacy, friend of court assistance, and direct representation both from Florence Project \nattorneys and through pro bono placements. Each of these facets of Florence Project’s \nwork is addressed in more detail below.   \n \n6.  First, the foundational level of our services to unaccompanied children are based on \nproviding age-appropriate legal education services and “know your rights” presentations \nand conducting individual legal screenings(intakes) with all unrepresented children in \nORR custody in Arizona. Under the UCP, Florence Project staff ensure that every \nunaccompanied child who is detained in ORR custody in Arizona receives age-\nappropriate, basic “know your rights” information and an intake in a language they \nunderstand within 10 business days of their arrival in an Arizona ORR shelter facility, \nwhere possible, in keeping with 45 CFR 410.1309(a)(2)(i)(B). For children who are \nreunified to a sponsor before Florence Project staff are able to meet with them, staff call \nthe child and provide a know your rights presentation and intake over the phone. Every \nyear, Florence Project staff provide these educational services to tens of thousands of \nchildren in Arizona; in 2023 alone, Florence Project staff provided 17,514 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 043\n\n(72 of 956), Page 72 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 72 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 19\nunaccompanied children with a “know your rights” presentation.  These are critical \nservices because unaccompanied children almost universally lack resources to afford \nlegal representation and, without the Florence Project, would not have meaningful access \nto accurate and age-appropriate resources to help them understand their rights, \nresponsibilities, or legal options.  \n \n7.  Second, Florence Project attorneys also attend every detained Unaccompanied Minor \nchildren's docket in the Phoenix and Tucson Immigration Courts and, where allowed by \nthe judge and appropriate, serve as Friend of Court for any cases in which the child is still \nseeking and likely to attain reunification with a sponsor or family member, and the Court \nrequires additional information to assess next steps. Because the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) requires that unaccompanied children “be \npromptly placed in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child,” \nmany of the children to whom we provide educational “know your rights” services \neventually reunify with sponsors elsewhere in the United States. As a result, Florence \nProject staff do not immediately enter as counsel on every child’s case in Arizona, but we \ndo ensure that no child is alone in court by being present and to help provide critical \ninformation to the Court regarding the status of the reunification process, best language, \nspecial vulnerabilities and other critical information, where appropriate and allowed by \nthe Court.   \n \n8.  Third, the Florence Project provides non-representational legal advocacy for non-\nrepresented children in ORR custody. This includes advocating with ORR shelters for \nthings like communication in the proper language, access to medical care, religious \naccommodations, access to education, access to proper food, access to communication \nwith family and sponsors, and access to counsel. Through this type of non-\nrepresentational advocacy, the Florence Project works to ensure that children in ORR \ncare are being treated with dignity, respect, and are not subject to discrimination or \nmistreatment, and that the shelters are abiding by laws surrounding the treatment of \nchildren.  \n \n9.  Fourth, every year Florence Project attorneys provide direct representation to hundreds of \nunaccompanied children in Arizona; in 2023 alone Florence Project attorneys represented \n1,091 unaccompanied children in Arizona. Excepting cases of ethical conflict, Florence \nProject attorneys represent all unaccompanied children who are placed into Long-Term \nFoster Care (“LTFC”) facilities in Arizona, as well as other unaccompanied children who \nremain in ORR custody during their removal proceedings or as they approach “aging-\nout” of the age of minority by turning 18. Additionally, Florence Project attorneys \nrepresent unaccompanied children who have passed through ORR custody and reunified \nwith family members or sponsors here in Arizona, or have been placed in the \nUnaccompanied Refugee Minor Program in Phoenix, AZ. In all these cases, Florence \nProject’s representation of these unaccompanied children can include representation \nbefore the Immigration Courts and the United States Citizenship and Immigration \nServices (“USCIS”), as well as representation in Arizona State Court juvenile or probate \nproceedings where necessary and appropriate for children who have been abandoned, \nabused, or neglected.  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 044\n\n(73 of 956), Page 73 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 73 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 19\n \n10. Fifth, Florence Project also has two specialized direct representation teams, which are \npartially funded by UCP. The first is the Children’s Trafficking Response Team, which \nworks to educate and guide staff and community stakeholders and partners on how to \nidentify and support child survivors or trafficking, or children at risk of trafficking. This \nteam is partially funded by UCP and works directly with unaccompanied minors who are \nat risk of or have survived trafficking, whether in the U.S., their country of origin, or on \ntheir journey to the U.S. The second in the Released Representation team which focuses \non providing direct legal and social services to children who were formerly detained by \nORR and living in the Phoenix metropolitan area.  \n \n11. The Sixth and final major component of the Florence Project’s Children’s Legal Program \nis our Children’s Pro Bono Team, who receive pro bono case referrals from Children’s \nProgram staff and then connect unrepresented unaccompanied children with pro bono \ncounsel from law firms or pro bono private immigration practitioners. Each year, our pro \nbono team places dozens of cases with volunteer attorneys before the immigration court, \nUSCIS, Arizona state courts, and Board of Immigration Appeals and provides full-\nservice mentorship, ongoing training, and technical support on those cases. Pro bono \nscreening and mentorship in cases before the agency also are funded and conducted, \nthrough the UCP contract. \n \n12. As of February 28, 2025,  the Florence Project provided free legal services to \nunaccompanied children at 24 shelters located in the State of Arizona, primarily in the \nPhoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas. These shelters have a combined capacity to \ndetain over 2,000 children on any given day. Of these, 18 facilities are located in \nMaricopa County and 6 are located in Pima or Pinal counties. These shelters include 3 \nLTFC facilities as well as 3 transitional foster care facilities that serve particularly \nvulnerable or special needs populations such as children under the age of 13, siblings \ndetained together, teens who are parenting or pregnant, and children with special needs.  \nUnaccompanied children in Arizona with active immigration court cases generally are \ndocketed on either the Phoenix or Tucson immigration court dockets and, as noted above, \nFlorence Project staff ensure that no detained unaccompanied child in Arizona stands \nalone in immigration court, either by representing children or being present to provide \nFriend of the Court services as deemed appropriate and approved by the Court.  \n \n13. The Florence Project currently employs 114 full time staff who are dedicated to directly \nproviding services under the UCP and whose positions are largely funded through U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding. Specifically, Florence \nProject employs 1 Program Manager and 1 Associate Program Manager as well as 9 \nmanaging attorneys, 9 managing legal assistants, and 1 managing social worker who \ndirectly oversee and train staff providing UCP legal services, help manage legal and \ncontractual compliance, and directly provide legal services under the UCP themselves. \n \n1 On February 28, 2025, Florence Project staff began to learn of “stop placement orders” and an accompanying \ndepopulation of various shelters we have historically served. The reason, scope, and anticipated duration of the stop \nplacement order and accompanying depopulation remain unclear at this time as do any possible plans for opening \npotential replacement shelter services in our region.   \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 045\n\n(74 of 956), Page 74 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 74 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 19\nAdditionally, Florence Project employs 21 staff attorneys and law graduates, and 4 \naccredited representatives who provide direct representation, legal consultation, and legal \neducation and screenings under the UCP;  1 pro bono Managing Attorney who oversees \nthe Pro Bono Program, screens volunteer attorneys, places cases, and supervises the Pro \nBono team, and 2 pro bono mentors who provide technical support to pro bono attorneys;  \n49 legal assistants and intake specialists who help provide know your rights presentations \nand legal screenings under attorney supervision; 9 social workers; and 3 legal \nadministrative assistants who support the team with UCP related data entry and billing \nrequirements.  Due to staff turnover, internal transitions, and promotions, the Florence \nProject also has 20 open positions that are contemplated under the Florence Project’s \nUCP that we have yet to backfill. In addition to our regular full-time employees noted \nabove, the Florence Project also currently hosts 3 Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) \nfellows and one Equal Justice Works (“EJW”) Fellow who work in conjunction with our \ngeneral staff to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings.   \n \n14. Staff providing representation and “know your rights” presentations to children in ORR \nfacilities routinely travel to each of the 24 shelter facilities in person to conduct client \ninterviews and screenings, prepare clients for hearings, as well as provide legal \neducation, legal screenings, and other legal support to detained children. Florence Project \nstaff are typically present in shelters anywhere from 3-5 days a week. The Florence \nProject represents unaccompanied children in removal proceedings in immigration court, \naffirmative relief such as seeking asylum before USCIS, U-visas and T-visas, Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) applications both before the agency and in state \ncourts for necessary predicate orders, BIA appeals, and petitions for review to the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals.  \n \n15. For every child that passes through ORR in Arizona, the Florence Project monitors to \nmake sure that the child is on track for reunification with a sponsor. If the shelter \nindicates that a child does not have a sponsor, or if the child has been detained for an \nextended period of time, or if the child’s case merits entering of representation, the \nFlorence Project will place the case with an in-house attorney or accredited \nRepresentative, or with a volunteer pro-bono attorney from the community. \n \n16. The Florence Project currently directly represents over 800 children under the UCP \ncontract. Some are children still in detention, and many are children who have been \nreleased from ORR and are living in Arizona, and have been waiting for their cases to be \nresolved for years due to government backlogs. Some cases take up to 6 years to \nconclude at the Legal Permanent Resident stage, and the presence of an attorney is \ncritical during that long time span since Immigration Law changes at a rapid rate. \n \n17. These various services provided under the UCP, from education through full \nrepresentation are a critical safety net for unaccompanied children who are or have been \nin ORR custody. The children the Florence Project serves are often extremely vulnerable \n– they have often experienced significant trauma, have been abused, abandoned, or \nneglected. Many have experienced discrimination, trafficking, or harm in their country of \norigin or en route to the United States. We routinely work with children who identify as \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 046\n\n(75 of 956), Page 75 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 75 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 19\nLGBTQ. We also regularly work with children who are experiencing symptoms of \nsignificant disabilities including mental health conditions as well as medical disabilities \nthat can directly impact their ability to participate in proceedings, for example vision or \nhearing impairment. Moreover, some of our child clients are very young such that their \nage presents unique barriers to their ability to participate in their legal cases. The \nFlorence Project also serves facilities that specialize in young or “tender aged” children \nunder the age of 13, where the children we at times encounter children who are so young \nthat they do not know even their parent’s names (aside from “mom” or “dad”). Florence \nProject staff have even represented children who were pre-verbal, with at least one client \nwho was only six-months old. For such individuals, the UCP is a critical safety net since, \nwithout the UCP, the vast majority of these particularly vulnerable children would be left \nwithout any information and most likely would face significant barriers to adequately and \nefficiently preparing their cases without counsel, nor would a child be well-positioned to \npay the thousands of dollars required to retain counsel. Indeed, almost universally, \nunaccompanied children lack sufficient resources and knowledge to obtain private \ncounsel and the Florence Project is the only non-profit organization that provides free \nlegal services to unaccompanied children who are detained by ORR in Arizona. Without \nthe services the Florence Project provides under the UCP, unaccompanied children in \nArizona would be forced to go through their legal process entirely alone, without a \nlawyer. However, immigration law is famously complex and given the \neducational/literacy barriers, language barriers, developmental stage barriers, age \nbarriers, and emotional and mental hurdles caused by past discrimination, trauma, and \nharm, the vast majority of our child clients would be simply incapable of navigating their \nlegal proceedings without assistance from trusted, independent legal and social service \nproviders like the Florence Project. Additionally, a significant number of the children we \nwork with are eligible for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), which requires \nproceedings and findings before state juvenile courts, which children simply cannot \nobtain without the assistance of counsel.   \n   \n18. Looking at SIJS in particular is useful to understanding how complicated and specialized \nthe work the Florence Project does with unaccompanied minors is. SIJS requires \nattorneys to be well-versed and competent to represent clients in not one, but two \ncomplicated areas of law: immigration removal defense and state court child welfare \nprocesses, which vary from state to state. In Florence Project’s experience, not only do \nour advocates need to be completely fluent in both areas to advocate in individual client’s \ncases, but historically we have had to do a great deal of education for both the state courts \nand the immigration courts about what the other side of the coin looks like and how the \nother court system operates. This requires regular stakeholder outreach, developing \nstrong relationships with courts, and participating in opportunities to educate judges and \ncourt staff, extending even to formal trainings where courts have requested such support, \nto ensure cases that involve both systems are able to move forward effectively and \nefficiently.  \n \n19. In addition to representing clients in their immigration proceedings, Florence Project \nrepresents clients in various forms of advocacy that arise incident to their custody. In this \ncontext, Florence Project staff play a critical role in building trust with clients and being a \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 047\n\n(76 of 956), Page 76 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 76 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 19\nconstant, dependable point of contact who is independent and not part of the United \nStates government, which allows these vulnerable youth to share information regarding \nabuse or mistreatment these children have experienced both before, during, and after their \ncustody by the U.S. government. Because we build this trusting connection with the \nchildren we serve, Florence Project clients have not only felt comfortable sharing \nexamples of abuse and violence they experienced in their countries of origin and during \ntheir journeys to the United States that are critical to developing their legal cases for \nrelief here in the United States, but also regularly share information about abuses they \nexperienced while in the custody of the United States government.  \n \n20. Examples of the types of abuses our unaccompanied children clients have reported to us, \nand about which the Florence Project has engaged in advocacy on our clients’ behalf, \ninclude lack of access to proper food, religious services, regular communication with \nparents or potential sponsors, clothing, hygiene items, parenting ability, and appropriate \nmedical care in both Customs and Border Patrol (“CBP”) and ORR custody; verbal and \nphysical assaults in CBP custody; physical abuse and sexual assaults in ORR custody; \nand attempted trafficking and/or grooming by ORR staff. Because we begin working with \nthese children within days of their arrival into ORR custody, Florence Project staff often \nare the first to learn about harmful government policies – things like widespread family \nseparations in 2017-2018 and the unlawful use of dental imaging as the sole basis to \nredetermine a child’s age as a justification for moving a minor into adult ICE custody. \nBecause we are independent legal service providers, we have the unique ability to \nadvocate on our clients’ behalf to raise awareness and push back against such harmful \npolicies.  \n \n21. For example, Florence Project staff screen each child for abuse or mistreatment at CBP \nfacilities prior to their arrival in ORR through questions designed to ensure that \nchildren’s legal rights are respected and that children are treated humanely by CBP. \nMany children the Florence Project encounters report being held for extended periods of \ntime beyond that allowed by the TVPRA, lacking proper food, being held in ice-cold \nfacilities or cages, having possessions, including religious items and medical items \nremoved, and being verbally and physically abused by CBP officers. We have heard \nstories of young mothers not being provided with blankets or diapers for their babies. In \nfact, over the last year alone, the Florence Project has documented over 150 complaints \non behalf of children and filed at least 30 formal complaints with the Office of Civil \nRights and Civil Liberties to seek official review and redress over abusive treatment or \nconditions children face while in CBP custody.2 For many children, it can take some time \nbefore they feel willing to open up regarding abuse or harm they have experienced. \nLimiting funding for legal service providers like the Florence Project to exclusively know \nyour rights presentations and intakes, will limit opportunities for Florence Project staff to \nbuild the type of trusting relationship with these children that enables children to feel \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 048\n\n(77 of 956), Page 77 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 77 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 19\nsufficiently safe to disclose abuse experienced, particularly abuse experienced at the \nhands of U.S. Government officials. This will create circumstances that put children in \nincreased danger of abuse and harm by government officials and allow abusive CBP \nofficials to continue to act with increasing impunity, emboldened by the knowledge that \nchildren will have few, if any, opportunity to report harm or resources necessary to do so \nin a way that would potentially result in any accountability. This directly undermines the \nFlorence Project’s mission to ensure that all people facing deportation are treated fairly \nand humanely. Florence Project’s ability to build meaningful trusting relationships with \nunaccompanied children under the UCP helps our staff identify disturbing patterns and \ntrends in the types of abuses our children clients report. The role of possible \nrepresentation is particularly crucial in cases where serious trends of harm appear, as was \nthe case, for example, when Florence Project staff were some of the first to note and blow \nthe whistle on how the Trump administration’s “Zero Tolerance” border prosecution \npolicy resulted in widespread separations of minor children from their parents at the \nborder. The type of public advocacy and media that eventually brought a halt to that \negregious family separation policy is only possible under portions of the UCP that allow \nfor additional legal services and representation, a fact that is surely not lost on this second \nTrump administration in this decision to eliminate all portions of funding that allowed the \nFlorence Project to advocate for our children clients in this way.     \n \n22. Beyond advocating for our clients when they have experienced more extreme abuses and \nharm while in ORR or CBP custody, Florence Project staff also routinely support clients \nwith other types of advocacy which are equally necessary to ensure the rights of \nvulnerable children are properly respected. This type of advocacy can include advocating \nfor less restrictive or more appropriate placements in custody as well as the least \nrestrictive placement when a child turns 18. It also includes advocating for access to \nproper medical care and treatment in custody – from everything for advocating that a \nclient with vision impairment be given glasses so they could see, to advocating that a \nclient with serious medical condition such as a coma is placed in a facility that is \nequipped to care for their needs.  We help our clients file complaints with oversight \nagencies to document and resolve myriad of issues that arise as a result of our clients’ \ncustody and vulnerable status.  \n \n23. Many of our child clients also speak languages other than English or Spanish and our \nstaff not only provide them with legal services and education in a language they \nunderstand, as required by the Foundational Rule, but also advocate that they have \nappropriate language access in immigration court as well as other spaces, including ORR \ncommunications and medical appointments. For example, our child clients frequently \nreport to Florence Project staff that ORR staff insist on communicating with them in \nSpanish, despite that fact the child does not speak Spanish or prefers another language. \nChildren also report to Florence Project staff being discriminated against by shelter staff \nfor speaking indigenous language, or African languages. Many indigenous children or \nchildren who are part of a minority have experienced discrimination at home due to their \nethnicity, race, or national origin, and it can be difficult for them to advocate for \nthemselves for access to communication in their best language, especially if the shelter \nstaff are displaying prejudice or discrimination against them. Ensuring that \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 049\n\n(78 of 956), Page 78 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 78 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 19\ncommunication takes place in the appropriate language that a child understands is critical \nand this is even more true when shelters or judges are attempting to share important \ninformation with the child. Florence Project staff not only regularly advocates that \nimportant government communications be conducted in the child’s best language, but \nalso meet with children in detention, build trust with our clients, and empower them to \nassert their language rights themselves. \n  \n24. Florence Project staff also often advocate for the medical needs of children. Florence \nProject staff have seen countless examples of ORR not taking adequate measures to \nprotect the health of children. Attorneys have advocated for visits to medical \nprofessionals who were able to diagnose conditions requiring surgery or medication, \nincluding for broken arms and necessary blood transfusions. Staff have learned of special \nmedical needs from children that the shelter did not know about, which resulted in \nchildren receiving life-saving treatment. Staff have advocated for proper dental care for \nchildren who had a difficult time eating due to mouth pain. Children have also reported \nORR staff misrepresenting the purpose of medical visits, children being told they are \ngoing to routine dental appointments only to later learn that the dental exams were \nactually completed for the purposes of age redetermination to facilitate transferring \nminors into adult ICE custody. Staff have also pushed back in cases where ORR was \nattempting to pressure minors to return to home country before proper medical care could \nbe assured for things like traumatic brain injuries, or other conditions.  \n \n25. The Florence Project also regularly advocates for First Amendment protections, \nparticularly access to religious activities, including ensuring that children are taken to \nservices, are given the proper diet, and are provided with adequate space and time to \ncomplete religious rites. Children who observe fasting have been denied food after \nbreaking fast, have had nighttime prayers interrupted, and have faced discrimination at \nthe hand of ORR staff for their religious observances. In such cases, the Florence Project \nplays a critical role as an independent third party able to both identify potential first \namendment and civil rights violations and empower our child clients to assert their rights \nas well.      \n \n26. Florence Project staff also frequently work with ORR and shelter staff to ensure that \nshelter staff refrain from the unauthorized practice of law. ORR staff are not legally \ntrained and are not lawyers with the associated privilege and confidentiality – they are not \nable to advise children as to their legal rights or counsel them on their legal options. \nDespite these known facts and rules against unauthorized practice of law, in many cases \nORR staff have provided legal advice to children, which more often than not has been \nincorrect, harmful, or contrary to the child’s wishes.  Florence Project attorneys regularly \ncorrect mistakes by ORR staff, for example, when ORR staff submit case assistance \nrequests through the Office of Trafficking in Persons (“OTIP”). The Florence Project has \nobserved countless cases where ORR staff’s submission was denied due to a lack of \nunderstanding of the requirements of an OTIP request for assistance, the child’s life, the \nlegal definitions of trafficking, or a combination thereof. In such cases, Florence Project \nattorneys have re-submitted requests and received OTIP approvals for case assistance for \nchildren who have rightly been determined to be survivors of severe forms of trafficking.  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 050\n\n(79 of 956), Page 79 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 79 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 19\n \n27. The Florence Project has long enjoyed a cooperative stakeholder relationship with our \nArizona immigration courts. Beginning from the initial call to action by an Immigration \nJudge that led to the creation of the Florence Project, Immigration Judges in Arizona \nhave consistently engaged with and welcomed the Florence Project’s legal education \nservices. In the context of unaccompanied children, both the Phoenix and Tucson \nImmigration Courts have a long history of working collaboratively with the Florence \nProject. For example, in both courts this cooperative stakeholder relationship has allowed \nfor the coordination of specialized dockets for unaccompanied children. The Florence \nProject has worked with the court and individual judges to ensure the children’s docket \nare as child-friendly as possible, with one judge even electing to wear a more informal \nHawaiian shirt instead of the traditional black robes. For decades, the vast majority of \njudges on the children’s docket have welcome Florence Project attorneys to serve as \nfriend of court to assist the court by sharing important information, such as updates \nregarding likelihood and timeline of reunification, the child’s best language, and other \ninformation necessary to properly and efficiently adjudicate children’s cases.  This \ncooperation has included everything from willingness to provide Florence Project staff \nspace in the physical courtrooms to conduct pre-court orientations to children before their \nhearings, to smaller acts of appreciation, including swearing in Florence Project law \ngraduates into the bar. Judges in Phoenix and Tucson have long relied on the Florence \nProject as a resource to which they may refer respondents who are confused or unclear \nabout the next step in their immigration court process. Judges in Phoenix have also \nallowed the Florence Project to serve as friend of court over the Government’s objection, \nin acknowledgement of the critical information provided for children’s cases. In both \nEOIR and ICE stakeholder meetings, government partners routinely express thanks and \nemphasize the value of the services the Florence Project provides.  \n \n \nUCP Stop Work Order, Stop Work Recission, and Subsequent Termination of all but \nCLIN 1 Funding Under UCP Contract \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 051\n\n(80 of 956), Page 80 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 80 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 19\nremain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes \noutside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication of poor \nperformance.”  \n \n29. On February 18, 2025, shortly after receiving the stop work notice, Florence Project \nleadership promptly notified all staff regarding receipt of the UCP stop work order and \nprovided additional specific instruction to staff who provided services under the UCP \nclarifying how they would need to change aspects of their work to follow that order. \nHowever, because the Florence Project’s mission is to provide free legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children in Arizona, we also immediately began to discuss \nhow we could potentially transition the critical services that had been conducted under \nthe UCP to other legal access mechanisms, specifically legal access as envisioned by \nprovisions of the TVPRA mandating that “to the greatest extent practicable...that all \nunaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the custody of [HHS or DHS] \nhave counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \nmistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” As such, we also provided instruction to staff \non how we envisioned ensuring continuity of legal and social services for children in \nORR shelters served by the organization without government funding, at least for the \nshort term.  \n \n30. Just three days after it was abruptly issued, the UCP stop work order was just as abruptly \nrescinded on February 21, 2025. Like the original stop work order, the cancellation of \nsaid order came via email notification from the UCP prime contractor and the actual \nrecission order from the government contracting office provided little to no information \nas to why the stop work order had been issued originally or why that decision had now \nbeen reversed. It simply stated that the stop work order had been cancelled and that all \nactivities under the contract could be resumed.   \n \n31. In the three-day window in which the UCP stop work order was in effect, Florence \nProject staff were consistently allowed to continue to access our child clients in ORR \ncustody without interruption from shelter or ORR staff using our own funds to support \nthis work. As of this date, it is not clear what, if any, reimbursement for those services \nFlorence Project will receive.  \n \n32. On March 21, 2025, again without warning, the Florence Project learned that HHS \nthrough the U.S. Department of Interior contracting officer, terminated almost all aspects \nof the current UCP contract. Again, the Florence Project learned about the nearly \ncomplete termination of services under the UCP contract through an email notification \nfrom the government prime contractor on the UCP program, the Acacia Center for \nJustice, at approximately 8:15 a.m. Arizona time. The termination was effective the same \nday we received it, March 21, 2025. As noted, HHS terminated the contract with respect \nto three of the four contract line numbers (“CLINs”): CLIN 2, which funds legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children, as well as shelter advocacy and other non-\nrepresentation services, such as pro bono referrals, friend of court services, and data \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 052\n\n(81 of 956), Page 81 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 81 of 956\ntracking3; (3) Attorney recruitment project and IJC fellows; and (4) Spanish language \ninstruction and interpretation. CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who \nrepresent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, which funds \nSpanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. For the time \nbeing, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR custody. Per the termination, \nHHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and \n4. HHS has not provided any justification for the termination of these services other than, \nallegedly, the “Government’s convenience.”  \n \n33. On March 21, 2025, shortly after receiving the notice of termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 \nunder the UCP contract, Florence Project leadership promptly notified all staff regarding \nthe terminations and provided additional specific instruction to staff who provided \nservices under the UCP clarifying how they would need to change aspects of their work \nto follow that order. That guidance explained to staff the different ways in which aspects \nof the critical legal services we provide children would be treated moving forward. For \nthose key legal services falling under CLIN 1 – initial KYRs and legal consultations – \nFlorence Project leadership explained to impacted staff that these services can and would \ncontinue without pause, explaining details like the fact that staff can and should use \nAcacia resources for third-language interpretation for such services. However, for those \nother critical and core aspects of our work with unaccompanied children – notably our \ndirect representation of said children, friend of court and docket presence, and data entry \n– the Florence Project leadership communicated that such work would no longer fall \nunder the UCP, staff may not refer to these programs as being through Acacia or the \nUCP, and staff cannot use Acacia interpretation resources to support such cases. Per \ninstructions from Acacia regarding documenting “unavoidable work” on open cases \nunder the terminated CLINs for possible, but not guaranteed, reimbursement through a \npotential termination settlement, Florence Project leadership requested that Florence \nProject staff continue to carefully document time, mileage, and data for internal purposes \nfor any work done on represented cases or other parts of the terminated CLINs. \nAdditionally, because the Florence Project’s mission is to provide free legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children in Arizona, with a core value of ensuring that no \nchild ever stands alone in immigration court, we also immediately began to discuss how \nwe could potentially transition the critical representational, shelter advocacy,and friend of \ncourt services that had been conducted under terminated CLINs of the UCP to other legal \naccess mechanisms. As such, we also provided initial instruction to staff on how we \nenvision ensuring continuity of legal and social services for children appearing pro se \nbefore EOIR as well as those whom we were already representing under CLIN 2 without \ngovernment funding. However, Florence Project funding is such that, without a massive \nnew source of revenue to support such efforts, the Florence Project will only be able to \nsustain these efforts at our current level based on general funding for a short period of \ntime.  Finally, we notified staff in our children’s program targeted communication that, \ngiven the loss of UCP funding, we had to hold on responding to any new case referrals \n \n3 On March 25, 2025, Florence Project received word that the government was considering moving data \nreporting requirements from CLIN 1 to CLIN 2, a process that still must undergo bilateral negotiation on \npricing.   \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 053\n\n(82 of 956), Page 82 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 82 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 19\nand refrain from entering into any new attorney/client relationships for unaccompanied \nchildren in Arizona.   \n \nOrganizational Harm Caused By Loss of UCP Contract Services \n \n34. As an initial matter, the termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 under the UCP contract will \ncause serious financial harm to the Florence Project. The UCP subcontract constitutes a \nmajor portion of the Florence Project’s overall annual budget, with an average value of \napproximately 12 million per option year on the full contract. The terminated CLINs \nrepresent – depending on the option year being considered – a lost value of over 8 to \nnearly 10 million dollars of funding that supports Florence Project’s core legal and social \nservices for unaccompanied children. Moreover, the termination of the majority of the \nUCP contract also means that the Florence Project will also have to pay out-of-pocket for \ninterpretation services for the child clients we currently directly represent – over 800 \nchildren with whom we entered into representation in good faith specifically under this \ncontract – for those who do not speak either Spanish or English. Given the vast number \nof clients we serve and the many languages they speak, this also represents a significant \nadditional expense. For example, in one month, Florence Project staff reported requiring \nat least 11,000 minutes of interpreter time. Without language support through the UCP \ncontract, this cost will be incurred by the Florence Project.  \n35. As noted above, over 100 staff members’ salaries are directly funded by the UCP \nsubcontract and the loss of more than 70% of the funding for the Children’s Program \nmeans that the Florence Project now faces needing to pay for those salaries using general \nfunding sources. The Florence Project’s ability to pay staff to continue our core work \nproviding legal and social services to unaccompanied children, work that is mandated by \nstatute and regulation, will become fiscally untenable in a matter of months unless the \nterminated CLINs are reinstated, or another massive influx of alternative funding can be \nidentified.   \n \n36. The termination of all but a small portion of the UCP funding reflects the Government’s \nintent to permanently shrink in size and end the provision of these critical legal and social \nservices to unaccompanied children. This is cause for serious concern as to the Florence \nProject’s overall budget, staffing plans, staff morale, longstanding community and \nstakeholder relationships, and the ability to keep qualified and trained staff with the \norganization. At the outset, due to transitions, internal promotions, and staff departures, \nthe Florence Project’s UCP subcontract contemplates 20 additional positions that are \ncurrently open. However, as a direct result of this termination, the Florence Project is \nundergoing a hiring pause on all currently unfilled positions. This hiring pause extends \nbeyond only those positions that would have been funded under the UCP; rather it \ntouches hiring for all currently open positions across the organization, with very few \nexceptions, given that general funding will need to be tapped to cover the substantial lost \nfunding for salaries that would have been covered under the UCP. Thus, staff and \nprograms across the organization, not only within the Children’s Program, feel both the \nnegative financial and morale ripple effects of this loss of UCP funding.  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 054\n\n(83 of 956), Page 83 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 83 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 19\n \n37. Moreover, the uncertainty around the budget and the Florence Project’s long-term ability \nto pay our staff’s salaries with general funds or fundraising is creating a sense of \noverwhelm and stress among remaining staff, both on the directly impacted team as well \nas on other teams, which negatively affects morale and people’s sense of job security. \nWhile the Florence Project hopes to avoid immediate layoffs, unless the terminated \nCLINs are reinstated or some miracle fundraising occurs, it is extremely likely that the \nall-but-total termination of funding under the UCP will necessitate substantial downsizing \nof the Children’s Program staffing. Indeed, Florence Project leadership has determined \nthat, based on this lost funding, layoffs will be necessary unless funding is reinstated, or \nwe receive miracle fundraising. As such, Florence Project leadership is beginning the \nmanagerial and administrative preparation for likely layoffs. Because the Florence \nProject is a unionized workplace, for most of our staff, the Florence Project must comply \nwith specific terms of our collective bargaining agreement (“CBA”) regarding \ncommunication with the union about termination, notice prior to termination of \nemployment, and severance payments. This, in itself, results in the Florence Project \nincurring additional financial burdens in the form of legal expenses to plan for potential \nnecessary layoffs with our labor and employment counsel to ensure compliance with our \nCBA and applicable laws as well as the financial loss of severance pay to any employees \nwho may be subject to layoffs.  \n \n38. It is also critical to note that people are not like cogs in a machine where one can be \ninterchangeably and readily replaced by another; once layoffs are announced and/or \nbegin in earnest, the Florence Project will lose staff and, with them, their experience, \nexpertise, and work towards our mission. Even if funding were to be restarted, we would \nnot be able to simply replace lost staff with equally qualified and experienced people. We \nwould have to invest significantly in recruitment and training any new or replacement \nstaff, which poses additional costs to the organization. Moreover, in the uncertain world \nof non-profit services, an organization’s reputation as a relatively steady or secure place \nto work carries great weight in that organization’s ability to recruit and keep qualified \nstaff. Thus, if we must undergo significant lay-offs due to lack of funding, the harm to the \nFlorence Project’s reputation as being able to offer reasonably secure employment will be \nirreparably undermined, which will make it exceedingly difficult for us to hire to replace \npositions even if funding is eventually restored.   \n  \n39. Additionally, the termination of all portions of the UCP contract touching on \nrepresentation of clients substantially harms both the Florence Project and our clients \nbecause the termination notice, it seems, provided no guidance, support, or wind-down \nprocess for the cases in which our attorneys have already entered. Florence Project \nattorneys are currently entered on over 800 UCP cases in Arizona. As is the case with all \nof Florence Project’s services, our representation of these children is entirely free of \ncharge to the clients. As attorneys, we have ethical obligations to our clients, particularly \nthose with imminent court appearances or key case filings or other deadlines. We cannot \nethically simply stop representing our child clients – doing so would not only be morally \nwrong but also would subject the Florence Project to substantial legal liability and our \nattorneys to discipline from the bar. Beyond this fact, we must also take into account the \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 055\n\n(84 of 956), Page 84 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 84 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 19\nparticular vulnerabilities of our clients – such as their young age, their lack of financial \nresources and in many cases their inability to work in order to raise funds for paid \ncounsel, language and education barriers, and the technical complexity of many of their \ncase – when determining whether terminating or otherwise limiting our representation \nwould be ethical or appropriate. As a result, minimally, the Florence Project will certainly \nincur significant expenses to continue representation to our clients who we are ethically \nobligated to continue representing despite the termination of these funds. And, given that \nour mission continues to be to provide free legal and social services with a vision of \nensuring that all unaccompanied children have access to counsel and are treated fairly \nand humanely, Florence Project continues to be dedicated to seeking means to continue \nrepresentation of all of our clients, current and prospective, as well. This means that our \ndevelopment efforts have been diverted from other critical initiatives to instead attempt to \nreplace as much as possible this lost funding and to try to reduce the impact of this \nmassive loss.    \n \n40. The complete termination of all CLINs touching on representation services, shelter \nadvocacy, friend of court services, and more will irreparably harm the people that the \nFlorence Project serves and severely hamper our ability to provide our core services. \nIndeed, just prior to the announcement of the termination of these programs, Florence \nProject staff noted DHS in Phoenix advancing cases of children in ORR custody, \nspeeding up the removal process. Similarly, in the Tucson EOIR, Florence Project staff \nrecently noted the appearance of children’s names on the court docket even where there is \nno evidence that Notices to Appear have even been filed yet with the courts in those cases \nand no notice of hearing listed on the EOIR Automated Case information system, raising \nserious questions both about accelerating the court process for children and doing so in \nways that may not comport with statutes, regulations, or due process. However, without \nfunding to provide representation or even appear as friend of court, it has become unclear \nhow Florence Project staff can best advocate regarding the legal propriety of placing \nchildren on a ‘rocket docket’ or scheduling children for court before charging documents \nhave even been filed. It is not realistic to expect children to navigate the complexities of \nimmigration court on their own in general, much less on an expedited timeline. \nAdditionally, our staff have recently experienced judges denying reasonable requests, \nsuch as administrative closure for children with claims for relief before USCIS. I \npersonally witnessed an Immigration Judge in Phoenix conduct group master calendar \nhearings rife with due process issues in which children were forced to answer the judge’s \nquestions related to notice, service, and, notably, best language out loud and all at once. \nPractices such as these all but guarantee that, without robust UCP services in place \ncontinuously, children’s cases will be expedited in a way that deny children the \nopportunity to reunify with sponsors and will result in children being ordered removed \nnot because of the merits of their case, but because of their age, developmental stage, lack \nof education or language abilities, and lack of knowledge or understanding of the legal \nrequirements. \n \n41. The due process cost of so many unaccompanied children potentially losing experienced \npro bono counsel across the state of Arizona, and indeed the nation, at the same time, is \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 056\n\n(85 of 956), Page 85 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 85 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 17 of 19\nalso going to be unmeasurable. Florence Project staff currently represent many children \nwho will suffer immediate harm if we are unable to continue representing them pro bono.  \n \n42. For example, Florence Project attorneys currently represent a set of siblings who fled \ntheir country of origin after their mother died and their sister was murdered in front of \none of the siblings. All three have applications for asylum pending before USCIS and \nthey have been recently approved for SIJS with deferred action. Both are processes that \nwill require additional complicated legal work, including potential asylum interviews and \nadjustment of status applications among other things, which will require the assistance of \nan attorney. Additionally, given the rapidly changing landscape in immigration law, \npolicy, and enforcement, it is apparent that these children will likely require additional \nsupport for legal counsel while their process is pending. Indeed, just recently, despite \nhaving actively been participating in their immigration process – they had attended \nUSCIS  biometric appointments and receiving approved I-360 Petition for Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status with deferred action, and the immigration court case was \nalready concluded with non-opposition by DHS to allow them to move forward with the \nUSCIS process – despite all of this, armed immigration enforcement officers came to \ntheir home claiming they were “missing” and demanding to speak to them about their \ncases. While seasoned attorneys work diligently to keep abreast of changes in \nimmigration law, policy, and enforcement and have training in how to respond to a \nsituation like this, it is unreasonable to expect children like these siblings to do the same \non their own. Additionally, with three children all needing legal services, the cost to hire \nprivate counsel would be a significant financial burden their sponsor. As such, the \nelimination of funding to support children like these would seriously harm these clients \nand cut to the very core of the Florence Project’s mission and services.  \n \n43. In another example, Florence Project staff attorneys recently learned about two separate \ncases of children, both babies, under the age of two-years-old who are in one of the \nArizona tender-aged shelters who are currently not getting reunified with their parents \nand require additional advocacy for the government to follow protocols established under \nthe Ms. L. v. ICE settlement agreement – a settlement agreement arising out of the \nmassive violation of rights of children and parents that occurred under “zero tolerance” \nfamily separation policies from 2017 to 2018. Like most two-year-olds, both of these \nchildren are pre-verbal and unable to advocate for themselves about anything, much less \ncomplicated matters involving legal settlement agreements and reunification policies. \nHowever, given the current termination of representation under the UCP, there is no \nfunding to represent these children or even advocate for them in any way short of full \nrepresentation. As such, Florence Project managers are currently assessing to what extent \nwe will be able to help these extremely young children without any funding, knowing \nthat we must either absorb the cost of representation for these extremely vulnerable \nchildren by drawing down on general funding or reassigning funds from other programs \nor stand by and allow the rights of these children to be violated. \n \n44.  Elimination of funding for the UCP program also creates an untenable system whereby \naccess by legal advocates to children in detention will be left up to the government \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 057\n\n(86 of 956), Page 86 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 86 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 18 of 19\noffices and workers, who are at times the very people abusing and trafficking children. \nWith this funding eliminated, children will have to pay for attorneys out of pocket, a \nconcept which boggles the mind, especially considering the dearth of experienced \nimmigration pro bono counsel in the United States. Moreover, there is already a serious \nshortfall of attorneys in Arizona who have the specialized experience needed to work on \ndetained children’s cases, which pose unique issues of law. The pool of attorneys willing \nto do the work is even smaller for children’s cases, as many children’s cases require \nadditional expertise in juvenile law in Arizona, which all FIRRP attorneys have, but \nwhich many private practioners do not. Indeed, while immigration court is a federal \nsystem which allows attorneys barred in any state to represent clients, only attorneys \nbarred in the state of Arizona may represent clients in state court proceedings; many \nprivate immigration attorneys who practice in Arizona (who may be barred outside of \nArizona and legally work on federal immigration cases) may not even be qualified to \nrepresent unaccompanied children who require these state court proceedings.  \n45.Without federal funding for UCP work, access to counsel also will be largely left up to\nthe ORR shelters. If this were to pass, it would create a clear conflict of interest, as ORR\nis often the perpetrator of abuse, mistreatment, or failure to follow legal protections for\nchildren. With the recent dismantling of the ORR Ombudsman office, and the Office of\nCivil Rights and Civil Liberties, children detained in ORR custody are placed in a system\nwith even less independent oversight and accountability than before, which makes access\nto free counsel more important than ever.\n46.Finally, elimination of access to the unaccompanied children who are detained in ORR\ncustody for representation, for the first time since we began working with unaccompanied\nchildren 25 years ago, is deeply disruptive to our core legal service model and will\ndirectly harm children who will be deprived free legal and social services, attorneys to\nrepresent them in court or assist as friend of court when they are waiting to reunify with\nfamily members. Unaccompanied children, particularly those who are placed in LTFC\nshelters, or who remain in ORR custody during their removal proceedings, or who are\nnear to turning 18 and require immediate urgent action on their cases to protect their\nrights, all groups children who the Florence Project now routinely represents as a matter\nof course, will have no means to pay any private attorney to represent them, leaving those\nwho are in many ways the most vulnerable most likely to be denied their basic rights. The\nloss of funding to support these services cut deeply at the Florence Project’s core mission\nand vision.  Children will no longer have caring advocates they can trust, who will get to\nknow their cases through expert and age-appropriate methods and advocate for their\nexpressed interests. Even the threat of loss of access and the resulting uncertainty it has\ncaused within our staff has had a profound impact on the morale of our staff who have\ndedicated their careers to serving unaccompanied children; now, facing the termination of\nall but the most basic KYR services to the thousands of children we serve is devastating\nto staff morale.\n47.Additionally, FIRRP’s vision that every person facing removal have access to counsel,\nunderstand their rights, and be treated fairly and humanely is also severely undermined\nby the elimination of the UCP. First, for the majority of children in ORR custody in\nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 058\n\n(87 of 956), Page 87 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 87 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-4     Filed 03/27/25     Page 19 of 19\nArizona, Florence Project attorneys and staff working under the UCP are likely their only \naccess to counsel and opportunity to receive pro bono representation. Eliminating access \nto representation and friend of court services under the UCP will ensure that children are \nforced into removal proceedings – proceedings we have already seen are being \naccelerated and conducted in part using mass hearings that violate due process – without \ncounsel. Termination of all but CLIN 1 of the UCP will effectively guarantee that more \nchildren in ORR custody in Arizona will go through their removal proceedings without \nan attorney to represent them or even help them navigate the system during their court \nprocess. No child should be expected to be able to learn immigration law and present a \ncomplex legal case against a trained government attorney, often in a language they do not \nunderstand, on their own.       \nPursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746, I declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true \nand correct. \nExecuted this 26th day of March, 2025 in Phoenix, Arizona. \n_____________________ \nRoxana Avila-Cimpeanu \nDeputy Director\nFlorence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project\nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 059\n\n(88 of 956), Page 88 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 88 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION DANIELA \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nHERNÁNDEZ CHONG CUY IN \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1. My name is Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy and I am the founder, owner and Directing\nattorney of the Law Office of Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy, a Professional Corporation.\n(“Law Office of D. H. CH. C.”).  Based in Pasadena, California, the Law Office of D. H.\nCH. C. provides comprehensive legal representation to unaccompanied immigrant children\nformerly in the custody the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) in Los Angeles, San\nBernadino, Ventura, and Riverside counties.  We are also the sole legal service provider\nfor two ORR long-term foster care facilities: Building Bridges Foster Family Agency in\nOntario, CA, and MarSell Wellness in Montebello, CA.\n3. In order to carry out this mission, the Law Office of D. H. CH. C. has several main work\ncomponents: (1) Representing children in long-term foster care under ORR custody in\nimmigration proceedings; (2) Representing unaccompanied minors who are not in ORR\ncustody in immigration proceedings;  and (3) Providing educational services in the form of\nlegal education “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations for unaccompanied minors\nunder the Post-release Initial Legal Service (“PILS”) program.\n4. The Law Office of D. H. CH. C. has been providing legal services for unaccompanied\nimmigrant children in California since May 2023. In May 2023, as subcontractors of the\nUnaccompanied Children’s Program, we began providing legal representation for children\ndetained in an LTFC in Ontario, California, and for unaccompanied minors who were no\nlonger in ORR custody in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Ventura, and Riverside counties.\nIn 2024, our services under the contract expanded to include a second LTFC facility in\nMontebello, California, and to cover a larger number of released unaccompanied children.\n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 061\n\n(90 of 956), Page 90 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 90 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\n5.  Since 2023, our office has initiated a combined total of 75 cases. In 2024, we initiated \nrepresentation for 15 children in long-term foster care and 27 children that have been \nreleased from previous ORR custody—a total of 42 children just that year. Just in the first \nfew months of 2025 alone, we have initiated representation of eight unaccompanied minors \nin long-term foster care, which is likely explained due to the uptick of children in need of \nlong-term care.  \n6.  Currently our office has 60 open cases under the ORR contract. To fulfill our duties as a \nprovider of legal services for unaccompanied minors, I have had to restructure my business \nmodel and the clientele my Law Office serves, limiting the number of private clients I can \ntake at any given time to accommodate the growing demand of competent legal service \nproviders for this vulnerable population.    \n7.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, the Law Office of \nD. H. CH. C. has maintained four staff members dedicated to providing legal services to \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  Specifically, our team is composed of two full-time \nattorneys, including myself, and two full-time paralegals. Our fourth and most recent hire \nwas welcomed to our team in October 2024.  \n8.  Staff providing representation and KYR presentations to children in long-term foster care \nregularly travel to meet each child in person to conduct client interviews and prepare clients \nfor Immigration Court hearings. Our staff visits the facilities at least once a month, with \nin-person visits often occurring on a bi-weekly basis. The LTFC clients can also request a \nvirtual meeting with their attorney for faster and more convenient scheduling; we take these \nsorts of meetings at least twice a week. In-person visits can range from one to four hours, \ndepending on the legal work to be done and the youth served on each visit. Child \nrepresentation requires a trauma-informed approach, so the work cannot be rushed. The \nclients will set the tone and pace for our work and conversations.   \n9.  In addition to providing representation in removal proceedings before the Immigration \nCourt,  we  provide  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  before  United  States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”) and California Family, Probate, and \nDependency court as needed.  A majority of the children we represent are eligible for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”), a critical form of immigration relief for \nchildren  who  have  suffered  abuse,  abandonment,  or  neglect.  SIJS  proceedings  are \nespecially pertinent to children in long-term foster care, who require dependency courts to \ndesignate an institutional caregiver to ensure their well-being.  Many children we serve are \nalso eligible for asylum, as they fear persecution in their countries of origin.  Our office \nprovides services not only to initiate their asylum applications, but to accompany them to \ntheir critical asylum interview before USCIS.  Other children we serve are eligible for U \nNonimmigrant Visas, as they have been victims of criminal activity in the United States, \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 062\n\n(91 of 956), Page 91 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 91 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\nthus we provide representation before the necessary law enforcement agencies to prepare \ntheir case.    \n10. A large part of our ORR contract focuses on serving unaccompanied children in long-term \nfoster care.  Unaccompanied immigrant children are placed in long-term foster care when \nthey have no one in the United States who is available to care for them.  These children \nrequire a particular form of representation, due to the increased vulnerability of not having \nan adult to be released to in the United States.  Due to their circumstances, children in long-\nterm foster care do not have the financial resources to pay for an immigration attorney.  \nFurther, many of these children experienced severe abuse, neglect, or persecution in their \ncountries of origin, and require trauma-informed advocates to help them navigate the \ncomplex world of immigration law. We have clients as young as two years old, who would \nbe unable to represent themselves before any court or government agency or to find a paid \nattorney. We represented  a client belonging to the Hazara/Suni ethnic and religious \nminority who fled Afghanistan after the takeover by the Taliban regime in 2021; we helped \nhim prepare and present his asylum application before the Los Angeles Asylum Office, \nand file other applications for relief before USCIS, all complex procedures he would be \nunable to navigate on his own, due to age, and cultural and language barriers. We have an \nindigenous Raramuri client, a 16-year-old girl who has no known direct relatives either in \nMexico or in the United States; we provided representation for the appointment of an \ninstitutional guardian in state court and just received notices of approval of her SIJS \napplication. We advocated before multiple stakeholders so that a family of four young \nchildren from Angola be released from ORR custody to reunify with their family in \nCanada.  None of these clients would have been able to seek relief without our assistance.    \n11. Our work is critical not only in preserving our clients’ access to justice, but in ensuring that \nthe Immigration Court’s juvenile docket runs efficiently. The consistency in the way we \nhave provided legal representation for our detained clients and prepared applications for \nrelief during the past two years has led to an efficient management of the juvenile docket \nat the Immigration Court in Santa Ana, California, where our cases are routinely terminated \nor administratively closed.  This avoids unnecessary delays, alleviates the Court’s and \nICE’s case load, and directs resources where they may be best and most efficiently used. \nOur advocacy for our clients ensures that the due process rights of children in immigration \nproceedings are respected without need of the Immigration Court mandating unnecessary \ncontinuances of their proceedings, or without requiring that the Immigration Judge take \nadditional time to explain to the children before them their rights in those proceedings and \nhow they could in theory advocate for themselves.  In every court appearance, Immigration \nJudges have expressed their gratitude for our work.   \n12. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  five  Contract  Line  Numbers  (CLINs). \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 063\n\n(92 of 956), Page 92 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 92 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 8\nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025 \n13. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers (CLINs):  \nCLIN  2,  Legal  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  as  well  as  other  non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children.  \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities, and CLIN 5, which \nfunds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent children not covered under other \nCLINs. Per the partial termination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n14. On March 21, 2025, I was notified via email communication by the Acacia Center for \nJustice that a stop work order had been issued for all the legal work we do under the \nunaccompanied children’s program. Immediately, I communicated this message to my \nteam, ordering them to cancel any activity that was not strictly necessary to fulfill our \nethical duties and giving them the rest of the guidelines necessary to comply with the order.  \n15. When I learned about the stop work order and termination of the contract, my office staff \nwas in State Court attending to guardianship hearings for LTFC clients, and in the LTFC \nprogram we serve. As soon as I was able to speak with them, I informed my staff to cease \nall work under the contract. Our office is scheduled to appear in Court on Friday, March \n28, 2025, on two separate cases, and to prepare for asylum interviews with the Asylum \nOffice and respond to USCIS notices before April 1, 2025. Until I am able to determine \nhow to proceed on each one of the cases without being in violation of the rules of \nprofessional conduct, I plan to appear in Court for our scheduled cases, and to attend all \nlegal and court mandated deadlines, so long as it is financially feasible.   \n16. Earlier today, the Lead Case Manager for one of the LTFCs my office serves, requested \nthat I make arrangements to speak with our clients tomorrow, March 27, 2025, to inform \nthem of the termination of the contract, per the request of their Regional Director. At this \npoint, I continue to navigate the ethical implications of the termination of the contract and \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 064\n\n(93 of 956), Page 93 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 93 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\nthe impact this will have on representation of my detained and non-detained clients. I \nrespectfully declined the program’s request and informed them that termination of the \ncontract does not automatically terminate legal representation, and that I will schedule to \nspeak with the minors as soon as I am able to provide them with clear responses of the full \nextent of the implications of the termination of the contract.  \n17. Currently, the funds we receive for our unaccompanied children’s work accounts for 70-\n75% of our overall budget.  Similarly, most of the work we perform on our daily operation \nrelates to these contracts. As a small firm, our entire staff is affected by a loss of \nunaccompanied children’s funding. Before we entered into this contract with ORR, my \nLaw Office was not dependent on this funding, but its demands have required me to \nrestructure my Law Office’s clientele and expand my staff.  From May 2023 to September \n2024, we managed to operate with two attorneys and one paralegal; we welcomed the \nfourth member of our team in October 2024.  Because my office is a private practice, the \npartial termination of this program will have a severe financial impact on the operation of \nmy Law Office.  Within two months I will not be able to cover the financial obligations \ntowards my staff or cover the cost of our daily operations.  As a private practice, we are \nestablished as an “S” corporation, and do not have the tax structure or lobbying capacity \nnecessary to secure the external funding required to solvently continue providing these \ntypes of legal services without the payment previously contracted.  \n18. For the duration of the original stop work order which occurred on February 18, 2025, we \nwere fortunate enough to continue providing the strictly necessary legal services to our \nexisting clients and fulfill our ethical duties with minimum repercussions.  Still, we were \nforced to reschedule appointments with clients and provide services like attending court \nhearings without knowing if we were going to be compensated for the work done, while \navoiding unnecessary stress or burden for our clients.  \n19. The effects of the current termination on our office are immediate.  The impact on our \nmorale is severe, as it forces us to restrict communications and services presented to our \nclients to the bare minimum, which is contrary to our client-centered approach.  Moreover, \nit will not be possible to provide a living wage to my staff and quality legal services to my \nclients as a Law Office without unaccompanied children’s funds. A shutdown of the \nunaccompanied children’s program income leaves us in the precarious situation of having \nde facto 60 new unfunded clients, from our total of approximately 150 clients, to whom we \nhave a duty to continue to provide service, at least for the foreseeable future.  Under the \nCalifornia Rules of Professional Conduct, attorneys in general may withdraw from their \nrepresentation if they are paid for services if the client breaches the agreement and the \nattorney  gives  them  reasonable  time  to  secure  new  representation,  amongst  other \nconditions.  However, the representation contract we entered with the children from the \nunaccompanied children’s program is pro bono. That is, our attorneys cannot unilaterally \nterminate their client’s legal representation solely for lack of payment or professional \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 065\n\n(94 of 956), Page 94 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 94 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\nfunding, particularly because it would be highly prejudicial for them as unaccompanied \nchildren while they are detained or underage.  Under Rule 1.16(d), a lawyer shall not \nterminate  representation  until  they  have  taken  reasonable  steps  to  avoid  reasonably \nforeseeable prejudice to the rights of the client, such as giving the client sufficient notice \nto permit the client to retain other counsel or obtain a copy of their legal file. It is very \ndifficult to see a scenario under which our young clients under long-term foster care, ages \n2-17, would be able to retain legal counsel on their own or to be able to present competent \nrepresentation that would make our withdrawal permissive under California Rules.  \n20. Continuing to operate with at least 60 unfunded clients for the foreseeable future will  likely \nbankrupt my small business.  It will force me to incur significant debt to try to once again \nredistribute the ratio of my client portfolio to serve additional private clients. With my \nreduced staff, and considering that we already serve over 150 clients, it would be nearly \nimpossible to manage a clientele restructuring while maintaining a full staff and sound \nfinances.   \n21. In addition, on January 8, 2025, my house was completely destroyed in the Eaton fire, in \nAltadena, California.  This forced my family of three, including my two-year old, to be \ndisplaced.  It was not until March 1, 2025, that we were able to secure temporary housing. \nThe disaster my family experienced disrupted my business operations. While my office \ncontinued working, and the rest of my staff was spared from the fire, I had to take \nextraordinary measures to be able to respond to the stop work order and the financial \nimplications that followed.  \n22. When I started the Law Office of D. H. CH. C. in 2020, I wanted to create a private law \npractice that could provide both a balanced environment for my staff and provide services \nso that clients of all backgrounds and resources could find competent and caring legal \nservices.  To this day, we aim to provide zealous, competent and holistic representation to \nour clients in the immigration system, whether detained or non-detained, and at all stages \nof their immigration removal proceedings. Our mission is still to provide client-centered \nand trauma-informed legal representation. I hope that we can carry on with this vision \nwithout it leading to financial ruin.     \n   \n   \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 066\n\n(95 of 956), Page 95 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 95 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-5     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 8\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 26 of March 2025, in Pasadena, CA.         \n       \n   ______________________________  \nDaniela Hernandez Chong Cuy \nDirecting Attorney/Owner  \nLaw Office of Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy \nUCP Legal Service Provider \n \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 067\n\n(96 of 956), Page 96 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 96 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 12\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ANA RAQUEL \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nDEVEREAUX (MIRC) IN SUPPORT \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and correct \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Ana Raquel Devereaux, and I am a Senior Managing Attorney at the \nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center (hereinafter, “MIRC”). MIRC is a non-profit \norganization that provides free legal services for children and other non-citizens who \nhave suffered abuse, trafficking, and persecution. MIRC is the only organization serving \nunaccompanied children in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement \n(hereinafter, “ORR”) in Michigan and the primary organization providing legal services \nto children in the unaccompanied refugee minor program in Michigan and to children \nreleased from ORR custody to sponsors in Michigan.  \n2.  Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) is a legal resource center for Michigan's \nimmigrant communities. MIRC works to build a thriving Michigan where immigrant \ncommunities experience equity and belonging. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is \na program of   . MIRC has five local \noffices  throughout  the  state  of  Michigan  which  provide  direct  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied children and also provide general community immigration legal services. \nOur five local offices are located in Detroit, Ypsilanti, Lansing, Grand Rapids, and \nKalamazoo. These five offices are supported by a statewide structure within MIRC to \nprovide training, administrative and supervisory support, community engagement, and \npro bono support.  \n3.  In  order  to  carry  out  this  mission  with  respect  to  providing  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied  children,  MIRC  has  several  main  work  components:  (1)  Providing \neducational  and  pro  se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” \n(“KYR”) presentations, conducting individual consultations (intakes), and conducting pro \nse  workshops  with  all  unrepresented  children  in  ORR  custody  in  Michigan;  (2) \nRepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration \nproceedings; and (3) Representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. \nWe  further  host  Immigrant  Justice Corps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied \nchildren  in  removal  proceedings  and  provide  Spanish-language  support  for  staff \nrepresenting unaccompanied children. \n4.  MIRC  has  been  providing  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  immigrant children in \nMichigan since 2009 at a smaller scale and with a dedicated unaccompanied children’s \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 069\n\n(98 of 956), Page 98 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 98 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 12\nteam beginning in 2017 when MIRC received its first subcontract to serve children in \nORR custody in Michigan. That first contract focused on providing KYR presentations, \nlegal screening, support for hearings, and representation as needed for all children in \nshort-term ORR custody in Michigan and providing universal immigration representation \nto all children in long-term ORR custody in Michigan.  \n5.  Since 2017, the ORR bed capacity in Michigan for short and long-term shelters and foster \ncare facilities has expanded significantly to its current capacity of 335 short-term beds \nand 122 long-term beds. In 2021, MIRC’s subcontract expanded to permit MIRC to offer \nrepresentation to children in Michigan who have been released from ORR custody and \nare in removal proceedings. MIRC has grown its capacity to represent released children \nfrom  240  to  565.  Additionally,  in  2021,  an  Emergency Intake Site was opened in \nMichigan with 225 beds. MIRC served all of the children in that facility by providing \nKYR  presentations,  conducting  intakes,  and  conducting  pro  se  workshops  with  all \nunrepresented  children  in  ORR  custody  in  Michigan,  and  offering  representation, \nespecially when the facility turned over its population and housed most of the Afghan \nUnaccompanied Minors who arrived in ORR custody and the contract provided for and \nrequired asylum and work authorization for these youth while in ORR custody. MIRC \ncontinues to serve all ORR beds in Michigan and remains ready to expand to serve any \nadditional facilities that serve unaccompanied children in the state and to reach as many \nreleased children for representation as is within our capacity, which we have continually \nexpanded to address the unmet need in the state of Michigan. At this time, we serve the \nfollowing  facilities:  BCC  Caminos  Nacional  –  Michigan  Children’s  Home  Society, \nBethany Christian Services – Wedgwood Christian Services, Bethany TLC, Bethany \nUSCCB (Bellaview and Casa del Sol), LIRS – BCS MI Kalamazoo LTFC – Casa de \nEsperanza, LIRS  – BCS MI Kalamazoo LTFC TGH – Hacienda De Luz, Samaritas \nLTFC, LIRS–BCS MI Alma Shelter, LIRS–BCS MI East Lansing TFC, LIRS–BCS MI \nGrand Rapids Shelter – TAC, LIRS–BCS MI Grand Rapids TFC, LIRS–BCS MI Holland \nTFC, LIRS–BCS MI Muskegon TFC, USCCB Catholic Charities West Michigan TFC, \nSamaritas Shelter – Grand Rapids,  Samaritas URM – LIRS – Lansing, MI ,  Bethany \nChristian Services URM – USCCB – Kalamazoo, MI ,  Bethany Christian Services URM \n–  USCCB/LIRS  –  Grand Rapids, MI , Bethany  Christian Services URM – LIRS – \nTraverse City, MI.    \n6.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, MIRC currently \nhas 147 positions serving children in and released from ORR custody in Michigan.  \nSpecifically, these 147 positions encompass 113 full-time employee’s worth of funding \nand dedicated services to unaccompanied children. Of these roles 58 are attorney staff \nroles (including attorney managers), 3 of which are Immigration Justice Corps Attorney \nFellows,  47  are  paralegals (all of whom are either DOJ-Accredited or are working \ntowards their DOJ-Accreditation), 13 are paralegal supervisors, and the remaining staff \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 070\n\n(99 of 956), Page 99 of 956  Case: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 99 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 12\nfocus  on  data  reporting,  administrative  case  support,  case  intake,  training,  and \ncommunication. \n7.  Staff  providing  representation  and  KYR  presentations to children in ORR facilities \nregularly travel to each facility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for \nhearings,  as  well  as  provide  legal  education,  individual  consultations,  and  pro  se \nworkshops for pro se children.  MIRC serves children in 9 short-term facilities, which \nrange in size from 12 beds to 36 beds. Each week, MIRC staff visit the facility one to two \ndays to provide KYRs and intakes with each child who has arrived within the last week \nand also to provide follow-up services to children who have been at the facility for an \nextended time or are otherwise in need of representational legal services. Additionally, \nthe children come to our offices one additional day during the week as that additional \ntime is usually required to complete all the services within the contractually required 7-10 \nbusiness day period after their arrival in custody.   Additionally, we have 8 long-term \nORR facilities in Michigan, ranging in bed size from 8 to 32. When children arrive to \nlong-term ORR facilities, MIRC assigns an attorney/paralegal team to meet with the child \nand offer representation within 30 days of their arrival.  \n8.  For  children  released  from  custody,  the  children  are  either  referred  through  the \nAcacia-facilitated  referral  system,  UCORD,  or  by  calling  our  intake line, once we \ndetermine  that the child meets the eligibility criteria while offices are accepting new \ncases, we then meet with the child within 30 days to offer representation. For children \nwith whom we have entered representational agreements, MIRC’s legal teams represent \nchildren in state and immigration court, file petitions with USCIS, file motions and \npetitions with the immigration court, file mandamus and habeas actions in the Eastern \nand Western Federal District Courts in Michigan, file appeals with the Michigan Court of \nAppeals, USCIS,  EOIR, the BIA (and in similar cases, we have proceeded as far at \npursuing appeals in 6th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals, but it has not been necessary yet \nfor a case under this contract), as well as pursue other advocacy efforts within ORR and \nother spaces where unaccompanied children are detained and/or receive services.   \n9.  Children in short-term ORR custody have just arrived in this country and generally have \nnever been in a formal custodial system. They speak many different languages and have a \nvariety of educational backgrounds, ranging from no formal education to middle school \nlevel schooling, including high school-age children because they have rarely had high \nschool educational opportunities. Due to all of these factors, they are not yet equipped \nwith the resources to fully understand what rights they have while in custody and it is \nessential for them to meet with legal services providers to understand that they have a \nright to bodily safety, contact with family, medical care, and educational services, among \nother rights guaranteed in the Flores Settlement and the Foundational Rule. Additionally, \nthe  immigration  legal  system  is  extremely  complex  and  nuanced,  and  without  an \norientation with a legal service provider, it would be near impossible for children, let \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 071\n\n(100 of 956), Page 100 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 100 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 12\nalone the non-attorney staff at these short-term custodial sites to be able to explain, to \nunderstand critical pieces of the system that affect them, including the importance of \nkeeping addresses up to date and attending immigration hearings (and even how to \nunderstand the notices that arrive indicating when a hearing will occur).  \n10. A reality that must be addressed is that children in custody are incredibly vulnerable by \nthe nature of a custodial system where the vulnerability factors for sexual and physical \nabuse  are  extremely  prevalent.  A  bad  actor  may  take advantage of these systemic \nvulnerabilities. If these children do not have access to legal counsel that is independent \nfrom ORR and the organizations that sub-contract to provide the custodial services, these \nchildren surely will face even greater levels of abuse in custody. MIRC intervened and \nrepresented children in 2023 when there was an instance of systemic sexual abuse of \nchildren in short-term custody in one of the ORR Michigan facilities. MIRC worked to \nrepresent  individual  children,  supporting  them  in reporting to law enforcement and \nparticipating  in  the  prosecution  of  the  crime,  and  holding  agency  staff  and  ORR \nleadership accountable for ensuring further protections are put in place for future children \nin custody at that facility. Additionally, MIRC represented individual children who faced \nabuse in  ORR foster homes and as soon as the child disclosed the circumstances to \nMIRC,  we  ensured  they  received  protection  and  there  was  accountability  for  the \nindividual and systemic failures that harmed the child.   \n11. In Michigan, if MIRC did not provide these services under the HHS contract, it would be \nimpossible for the majority of the children to receive representation. The private bar in \nMichigan is relatively small and generally at capacity. Very few private immigration \npractitioners take children’s cases, due to the specialty area of law it encompasses. The \nfew attorneys who do take the cases will charge $10,000 on average, which is outside of \nreach for most children released to the community and impossible for all children in ORR \ncustody who by definition have no family or financial support in the country. Before \nMIRC began working under the contract, we would receive frequent calls from staff at \nthe ORR facilities asking us to take the cases because no one else would do so, but \nwithout offering any funding for the work. We turned down a large number of these cases \ndue to a lack of capacity. \n12. Since MIRC’s founding in 2009, MIRC has engaged in recruitment and mentorship of \npro bono attorneys to the fullest extent possible, but a significant challenge has been that \nin the state of Michigan, pro bono attorneys do not generally have immigration expertise, \nonly speak English (and unwilling to pay for interpretation for pro bono cases), and are \nunwilling to commit to the timeframe of children’s immigration cases or with the special \ncare needed when working with children. Only recently have we had some small success \ninvolving pro bono attorneys in our children’s work, and it has been because the HHS \ncontract funds language support for the pro bono attorneys and we have a dedicated team \nto train and support those pro bono attorneys. Even with this support, the pro bono \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 072\n\n(101 of 956), Page 101 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 101 of 956\nattorneys will usually only offer support in small ways and rarely or never take on full \ncases for representation. \n13. A few other small non-profit legal service providers exist in the state of Michigan, but all \nof them are quite small and have only had capacity to focus on primarily adult and \nUSCIS-only representation, leaving no other non-profit options for children in removal \nproceedings aside from MIRC. \n14. In  addition  to  MIRC  providing  the  only  available  and  financially  accessible  legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied immigrant children in the state of Michigan, MIRC \ndedicates significant resources to ensuring the staff MIRC hires are culturally humble, are \npassionate  about  serving  immigrant  children,  are  trained  in  best  practices  for \ntrauma-informed and child-friendly legal services, follow strict child abuse prevention \nguidelines,  and  as  much  as  possible  share  cultural,  linguistic,  and  experiential \nbackgrounds with our child clients.  \n15. Under the unaccompanied child legal services program, since 2017, MIRC has entered \nrepresentation for 1,697 children, provided 5,686 Know Your Rights sessions, 4,061 legal \nscreenings, and identified 6,158 potential pathways for relief for our young clients. We \nhave represented children as young as 10 months old. In 2024, MIRC offered legal \nservices and representation to children who spoke 62 different languages MIRC has filed \nasylum for 725 children, with an 83% approval rate, and filed 351 applications for \npermanent residency, with 155 of those already approved (the remaining are pending). \nMIRC currently has over 900 cases open for unaccompanied children in removal \nproceedings. These numbers result in real, meaningful changes in the lives of children \nand families, children who grow up to thrive and be part of our communities. \n16. MIRC has represented children fleeing abuse, including those who were regularly \nwhipped with electric cords or who faced ongoing sexual abuse with no hope of \nprotection from their communities. MIRC has reunited children with loved ones–children \nshould have the opportunity to be children and the law requires them to be placed in the \nleast restrictive environment feasible, the best place for a traumatized child is with the \nfamily or community members with whom they feel most comfortable. These were \ncourses of action that required a lawyer due to their complexity, the legal expertise \nrequired, the many logistical barriers within USCIS and immigration court. Without  \nlegal representation, these children would have been forced to return to situations of \nabuse, persecution, and lack of safety due to the inability for a child to meaningfully \npresent their case. \n17. We have also represented children who have been trafficked, such as children who were \nforced to do dangerous work and beaten when they were too sick to go to work. One of \nthe most powerful tools that traffickers use is the threat of deportation to intimidate their \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 073\n\n(102 of 956), Page 102 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 102 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 12\ntargets. Taking lawyers away from children strengthens traffickers’ hands. Many times \nour legal services have prevented children from falling through the cracks–sometimes by \nidentifying abuse in custody and supporting children in coming forward to authorities \nabout such abuse and sometimes by helping children who find themselves in an unsafe \nsituation obtain safe housing or meet other needs to escape violence. \n18. In  addition  to  the  work  we do for children in and released from ORR custody in \nMichigan, we also work to connect children with counsel when they are moved to an \nORR placement outside of Michigan or are released out of state. We work with the child \nand use the information we obtained during intake consultation to prepare a referral and \nhave staff dedicated to following up to do our best to connect children to free legal \ncounsel in their new location.  \n19. MIRC is well respected among the local state courts, immigration courts, ICE, USCIS, \nand  local  ORR  subcontractor  staff.  MIRC  developed  norms  with  each \nORR-subcontracted facility by having quarterly meetings to work through logistics and \ncontinue to uphold best practices on behalf of the children in custody. Staff from these \nagencies regularly express their gratitude for MIRC staff and how essential they are for \nthe children. MIRC and the immigration court staff developed a weekly call framework \nwhere MIRC efficiently funnels the matters needing the court’s attention through one \ncentral point of contact, rather than having more than fifty representatives reaching out \nindividually  to  get  questions  answered  or  provide  information.  The court regularly \napproaches MIRC for support for pro se respondents and in support of MIRC remaining \non the court pro bono list (MIRC is the only organization on that list in Michigan). MIRC \nregularly  engages  with  ICE  and  USCIS  both  in  representational  settings  and  in \nstakeholder engagement contexts respectfully and collaboratively on behalf of the clients \nwhen possible. One of Detroit’s Immigration Judges recently took some time after a \nhearing to thank  our staff member for working for MIRC and for all the great and \nimportant work MIRC does.  \n20. Additionally,  MIRC  received  the  Champion  of  Change  award  in  2024  from  the \nGovernor’s Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and Children's Advocacy Centers of \nMichigan, as part of the nomination for the award, Veronica Thronson, leader of the \nMichigan State University College of Law’s Immigration Clinic, was quoted as praising \nMIRC as follows: \nThe nominee has been a champion for children since its inception, through direct \nrepresentation of children and their families in seeking protection in immigration \nand state contexts... These children have been abused, neglected, or abandoned in \nthe State of Michigan. MIRC's team has grown from two attorneys to its current \nsize of [, with] staff members focused specifically on protecting the rights of \nchildren  in  federal  custody  in  Michigan, achieving permanent protection for \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 074\n\n(103 of 956), Page 103 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 103 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 12\nchildren through state and federal courts, and advancing the law to create the \ngreatest access to these protections for all children in Michigan. MIRC has stood \nin the gap during family separation under the Zero Tolerance policy and ensured \nthat all children in Michigan were reunited with their families according to their \nwishes. Further, MIRC has held the federal government and its subcontractors \naccountable when children’s rights were violated in federal care in Michigan, in \nlicensed and unlicensed facilities. The nominee has led efforts to try to ensure \nresponses to abuse in custody are trauma-informed and provide the protection \nneeded for children in care.   Illustrative of the difference that the nominee’s \nservices have made in the lives of children, in 2023 alone, the nominee served \nover  one  thousand  children  through  Know  Your  Rights  presentations,  legal \nscreenings,  and  direct  representation  in  immigration,  state  court,  and before \nimmigration agencies. Also in 2023, the nominee secured state court protections \nin  multiple  counties  and  began  a  path  toward  citizenship  for  hundreds  of \nimmigrant children. More stable immigration status allows children to thrive in all \nother aspects of their lives.  \nThe nominee recently added an innovative team to address social, emotional, and \nphysical needs, which has already assisted over 150 children. The nominee has \nincreased  knowledge  of  protections  for  immigrant  children  in  state  courts \nthroughout Michigan, creating a safety net for children across the state. These \nchildren who are released to sponsors or relatives frequently went without access \nto an attorney before the nominee’s programming emerged to serve them. MIRC \nhas been the leader in appellate cases that have enshrined protections available \nunder  the  law  to  immigrant  children  who  have  been  abused,  neglected,  or \nabandoned. In particular, the nominee has won two critical appeals that serve as \nseminal case law impacting immigrant children in Michigan.  \nThe nominee leads several collaborative efforts with stakeholders to enhance \noutcomes for children, through joint advocacy, training, and resource sharing. As \nnew populations of immigrant children enter the state, the nominee has taken a \nleading role in assisting service providers to be ready to welcome children in a \nculturally  informed  and  humble  manner.  Where  necessary,  the  nominee  has \nadvocated on behalf of children whose religious and cultural needs were not fully \nmet by other service providers and to ensure that children who are victims of \nsexual assault, human trafficking, and other crimes are met with a holistic and \nculturally sensitive response. For example, the nominee has worked with law \nenforcement to inform them of the impact of trauma on specific populations, such \nas youth arriving from Afghanistan who had been evacuated during the Taliban’s \ntakeover and who had been separated from their families. \nThe nominee has also championed change through legislative advocacy at the \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 075\n\n(104 of 956), Page 104 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 104 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 12\nstate level to enhance protections for  children who are harmed through child \nlabor, to expand access to Medicaid to children in need, and to ensure language \naccess  for  state  services. In particular, the nominee has partnered with state \nlegislators  to  increase  protections  for  children  exposed  to  exploitative  labor \npractices, partnering with various stakeholders and leaders to testify on the needs \nof children to local, state, and national media. \nOverall,  MIRC  has  changed  the  landscape  of  representation  for  immigrant \nchildren for the better in ways that are measurable in the law and the experience \nof children and their families in the community. Over the years, thousands of \nchildren have safety, stability, and the opportunity to thrive in no small part due to \nthe  team  focused  on  the  rights  and  representation  of  immigrant children in \nMichigan that the nominee has been able to cultivate and grow and seeks to keep \ndoing so to continue to serve children. \n21. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the \nInterior)  issued  a  national  contract  stop  work  order  for  Legal  Services  for \nUnaccompanied Children, effective immediately, which extended to all five Contract \nLine Numbers (CLINs): 1. KYR presentations and legal services for pro se children in \nORR facilities; 2. Legal representation for unaccompanied children not in ORR custody; \n3. Legal representation for unaccompanied children in ORR custody; 4. Spanish language \ntutoring for organizational staff who work with children; and 5. Immigrant Justice Corps \nfellows  who  represent  children  not  covered  under  other  CLINs.  Without  further \nelaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order states that it “shall remain in \nplace until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n22. Some MIRC staff were on a virtual meeting led by the Acacia Center for Justice on other \nmatters when the Acacia Center for Justice received notice of the stop work order around \n1:00  PM  EST.  Information  was  shared  on that call and an email was sent shortly \nthereafter to the entire network. We then immediately had to sort out what this meant in \npractice and how to ensure every staff member received the information and began to act \naccordingly. We had an urgent leadership meeting to understand the stop work order and \nattended an Acacia call hosted on the topic of the stop work order and then held a \nmeeting for our team to explain what we knew at that point, which was very little.  \n23. During the stop work order, MIRC used a small fund reserve to ensure our clients had the \nbest possible service for as long as possible. The stop-work order did not cut off legal \nrepresentation for children who are already represented. Because MIRC’s lawyers had \nalready filed paperwork with the court and USCIS as the attorney of record for our cases, \nthey are obligated to continue representation or face the possibility of sanctions or bar \ncomplaints — unless they ask a judge to be removed from the case, which takes time and \n8 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 076\n\n(105 of 956), Page 105 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 105 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 12\nhas very specific ethics rules that guide how to make this request and when and if a judge \nwill grant it. These reserves can only carry our staff for a few weeks. Roughly 80% of \nMIRC’s budget is funded through the unaccompanied children’s HHS funding. If we lose \nthis funding in the long term, we would expect to let go of all of 113 employees, in other \nwords, we do not expect meaningful replacement funding that would allow us to carry on \nthe work under this contract. We would also need to seek to withdraw from all of the \n1,205 open cases under the contract and would need to use reserves to have staff focus on \nthat work. The reserves are a critical part of MIRC’s long-term sustainability, so the Stop \nWork Order and any other loss of funding under this contract affects MIRC’s other work \nin the community for other vulnerable populations.  \n24. During the stop work order, we paused offering KYRs and intakes for children in ORR \ncustody and focused on using our limited resources to maintain our ethical obligations to \ncurrent child clients.  \n25. Time spent on stop-work order logistics cost us valuable time in needing to communicate, \nunderstand, and change our case management practices to account for the change under \nthe stop-work order. More than that, it has caused a significant feeling of instability, \nstress, and low morale. MIRC’s highly trained, experienced, and specialized staff are \nbeginning to put in their resignation notices to go to jobs that have more funding security. \nMIRC has built an outstanding reputation as an employer and has been able to attract \nunusually high quantities of staff to our work, compared to similar local non-profits, \nbecause of our commitment to the community, our stable funding, and our efforts to train \nand support our staff in their work. This reputation is being significantly undermined by \nthe stop work order and the subsequent lack of security around the ongoing funding of \nthe contract and it will make it harder to attract new staff in the future to replace those \nwho have left during this time.  \n26. When the stop work order was rescinded, MIRC resumed providing all services under the \nUCP contract. On March 21, 2025, MIRC received notice of ORR’s termination of \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4 of the Acacia UCP contract, effective at the close of business that day.  \n27. MIRC currently represents over one thousand children under the Acacia UCP contract \nCLINs 2 and 3 work. These cases involve representation before Michigan local state \ncourts, USCIS, and the Detroit Immigration Court. Without CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding, \nMIRC will begin an immediate process to withdraw from these cases. Even though we \nhave  made  significant  efforts  to  fundraise  with  individual,  foundation,  and  local \ngovernment funding, there is no meaningful replacement for the funding offered for \nrepresentational  services  of  unaccompanied  children  under  the  UCP  contract.  Our \nalternate fundraising may allow us to keep as many as 100-200 cases open, which would \nleave  over  800  children  whose  representation  we  will  need  to  withdraw  from \nimmediately. While we will begin our efforts to withdraw from the cases for which we \n9 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 077\n\n(106 of 956), Page 106 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 106 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 12\ndid not obtain alternate funding, the process of withdrawal takes some time with ensuring \nthe proper wrap-up tasks have been completed so the client is not unduly prejudiced by \nthe withdrawal and counsel needs to formally seek to withdraw where we have entered \nappearances before tribunals, which takes time and is subject to the decision of the judge \non each case.  \n28. While we have attempted to do the most we could for each client before we were in the \nposition, we still have many clients for whom no relief has been filed because we have \nonly  begun  working  on  their  cases  recently  or  there  were  external  hurdles  to \naccomplishing our initial goals in the case. Almost every one of the children MIRC \nrepresents qualifies for protection under the immigration law, however, it is a lengthy, \narduous, and legally complex process that allows us to usher the client to the point of \nreceiving the immigration status they qualify for. Many of the children whom we will no \nlonger be able to represent due to the termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4 of the UCP \ncontract will be unable to secure new counsel and be unable to navigate the immigration \nprocesses without counsel, and so will be left without protections they qualified for and \nwill  be  deported  to  situations  where  they  would  face  abuse,  neglect,  persecution, \nseparation from critical caregivers and services. In all of this, expecting these children to \nface the immigration system without counsel will have deprived these children of their \nright to due process under the law.  \n29. CLINs  2,  3,  and  4,  comprise  about  75%  of  MIRC’s budget. Of the 113  full-time \nemployee’s worth of funding in our UCP budget, about 98 of those are in CLINs 2, 3, and \n4. If funding from CLINs 2, 3, and 4 is not restored within a few days, MIRC will need to \nproceed to provide layoff notices to the majority of staff funded under those CLINs. We \nare able to use some of the funds we raised to allow us to provide staff a short notice \nperiod to withdraw from cases and honor their rights as employees. Even this little bit of \nessential transition period after a layoff notice, will cost MIRC at least 1.2 million dollars \nof funds drawn from other sources that take away from MIRC’s ability to serve other \nvulnerable populations.  \n30. However, if the restoration of CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding is delayed any more than a week \nand we have already given staff their layoff notices, we expect most staff will still seek to \ndepart,  even  if  funding  is  restored,  because  of  the  uncertainty  and  individualized \ndetriment to their morale to know they specifically were not retained. Even as we have \nbeen nearing the end of the contract period, more and more staff have been departing, \nespecially  our  more  seasoned  staff,  because the earlier stop work order gave them \nconcern for the future of the funding. \n31. If the restoration of CLIN 2, 3, and 4 funding is delayed any more than a month, and we \nwould be in a position to have to rehire for the work, it would be unlikely that most of the \nlaid-off staff would be interested in returning. Before this season of funding uncertainty, \n10 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 078\n\n(107 of 956), Page 107 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 107 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-6     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 12\nMIRC has been close to exhausting the hiring pool of those interested in and able to do \nwork under the UCP contract, especially where attorneys are concerned, and so I expect \nour success in bringing on new staff would be limited, to begin with, and it would cost us \nthe months of labor in recruiting, hiring, onboarding, and building their familiarity with \nthe work that it takes to return to the staffing norm we have now. \n32. Beyond the cost to the staff themselves, the cost to the clients of closing cases, laying off \nstaff, then having to bring on new staff, and trying to reach out to clients to try to offer \nthem representation again is devastating, specifically shattering those relationships of \ntrust which have taken so much to build. A stable and trusting relationship is critical for \nchildren. They will have no reason to trust our ability to continue to keep their cases and \nthey will have to build relationships with new people, assuming they are available, which \nis already hard for anyone having to share the most traumatic details of their life story in \norder to pursue immigration relief, but it is especially hard for a child in that situation.  \n33. The uninterrupted and ongoing funding of this work with unaccompanied children is \ncritical to the protection of children from harm in custody and against the significant risk \nposed by going through removal proceedings without counsel and the subsequent harm \nthat would result from removal. Not only that, but the stability of this funding is critical \nto MIRC’s ongoing work as an anchor immigrant rights organization. \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the District of Columbia that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 22 of March 2025, in Lansing, Michigan.           \n            \n_______________________________  \nAna Raquel Deveraux (P79145) \nSenior Managing Attorney \nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center \n11 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 079\n\n(108 of 956), Page 108 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 108 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF JILL MARTIN \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nDIAZ, ESQ.

My name is Jill Martin Diaz (they/them pronouns and Mx. honorific), and I am the \nExecutive Director  at Vermont Asylum Assistance  Project  (VAAP;  www.vaapvt.org). \nVAAP is a nonprofit immigration law firm dedicated to expanding access to critical legal \nservices for noncitizens across Vermont. VAAP grew from years of grassroots advocacy to \nmeet low-income Vermonters’ increasingly urgent needs for structured, equitable, and \ntrauma-informed  immigration  representation.  Today,  VAAP  is  Vermont’s  only  firm \ndedicated  to  providing  legal  services  to  indigent  unaccompanied  immigrant  children \nexiting detention, other youth and adult subpopulations in removal proceedings. \n2.  VAAP is a legal services organization committed to expanding access to immigration legal \nknowledge and direct services. We envision a Vermont where noncitizens fully understand \nand access their legal rights, and where immigrant and mixed-status families feel a true \nsense of belonging, regardless of legal status. Founded in 2021 by grassroots volunteers, \nVAAP incorporated as an independent 501(c)(3) in late 2023. Now guided by an 11-\nmember board and staffed by a supervising attorney and three legal advocates, including \ntwo pending admission to practice, VAAP is mobilizing dozens of pro bono attorneys and \ntransforming Vermont’s immigration legal landscape through direct representation, pro \nbono coordination, technical assistance, and advocacy at the state and federal levels.  \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, VAAP has several main work components, including: (1) \nProviding educational and pro se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” \n(“KYR”) presentations, conducting individual consultations (intakes), and conducting pro \nse workshops with all unrepresented children exiting ORR custody into Vermont; and (2) \nRepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration \nproceedings.  We  further  host  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  (IJC)  fellows  to  represent \nunaccompanied children in removal proceedings and provide Spanish-language tutoring \nfor staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  VAAP has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in Vermont \nsince 2024. This marked a significant milestone for access to justice as VAAP doubled its \nstaff and brought Vermont its first-ever IJC Legal Fellows: Cameron Briggs Ramos and \nEmma Matters-Wood. Both are Unaccompanied Children Program (UCP) fellows who \nstarted in September 2024 and expanded VAAP’s intake criteria to not only include legal \nservices  for  immigrant  youth  and  over-18  UCs  but  also  to  guarantee  universal \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 081\n\n(110 of 956), Page 110 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 110 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\n \nrepresentation for all under-18 UCs exiting ORR custody into Vermont (noting Vermont \nlacks any ORR facilities in-state.).  \n5.  Since VAAP added two full time IJC UCP fellows to our staff in September 2024, we have \nbegun serving a combined annual number of around 135 immigrant children including: (a) \nabout 15 under-18 unaccompanied children leaving ORR custody and seeking full-scope \nrepresentation  on  asylum,  Special  Immigrant  Juvenile  Status  (SIJS),  or  related \nhumanitarian relief; (b) about 20 factually unaccompanied children who were not so-\ndesignated and/or were over-18 at intake and are also seeking full-scope representation; \nand (c) about 100 derivative beneficiary children included in their parents’ pro se asylum \napplications filed at VAAP-supervised pro bono legal clinics.  \n6.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, VAAP currently has \nhired two full time staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied \nimmigrant children. Specifically, VAAP employs IJC UCP Fellow Emma Matters-Wood \non a full-time basis directly serving clients statewide for a renewable one-year contract \nperiod from September 1, 2024, through August 31, 2025; and IJC UCP Fellow Cameron \nBriggs Ramos on a full-time basis directly serving clients statewide for a two-year contract \nperiod from September 1, 2024, through August 31, 2026. \n7.  VAAP staff providing representation and KYR presentations to children leaving ORR \nfacilities  to  a  Vermont  parent  or  caregiver  regularly  meet  clients  to  conduct  client \ninterviews, prepare clients for hearings, as well as provide legal education, individual \nconsultations, and pro se workshops for pro se children. The kinds of legal matters VAAP \nrepresents children in include removal proceedings in immigration court, affirmative relief \nlike asylum before USCIS, SIJS in state court, and advocacy in terms of equal access and \nenjoyment of state law-based rights and remedies. \n8.  As  Vermont’s  foremost  immigration  technical  assistance  provider  and  main  conduit \nbetween regional and national communities of practice and local communities, the unmet \nneed for KYR services/pro se workshops and/or legal representation is astonishing. These \nunmet needs are due to, for example, unaccompanied children not being able to afford \nrepresentation,  age  of  children,  trauma,  language  barriers,  geographic  isolation, \ntechnological and transportation barriers isolating rural parts of the state, lack of attorneys \ndue  to  remoteness  of  Vermont  towns,  and  scant  amount  of  nonprofit  and  private \nimmigration attorneys in the region.  \n9.  Vermont-based children trying to apply for various kinds of relief and/or advocate for \nthemselves without an attorney find it functionally impossible to access their removal \nproceedings in the Boston and Chelmsford Immigration Courts, as Vermont lacks public \ntransportation, services, and awareness and only represented parties can access virtual \nproceedings. Caregivers for unrepresented Vermont children as young as five years old \nhave contacted VAAP letting us know that without a cash grant for transportation and \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 082\n\n(111 of 956), Page 111 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 111 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\n \novernight accommodation and meaningful language access assistance, they would be \nunable to get the children to Immigration Court let alone to assist them to prepare and file \nthe children’s meritorious applications for legal relief. When VAAP has been able to offer \nrepresentation—universally to eligible UCs through the IJC UCP Fellows, and ad hoc to \nother immigrant children in Vermont—we have successfully stabilized children’s status by \nsecuring relief including SIJS; and promoted judicial economy by terminating proceedings \nfor children where court jurisdiction is improper. \n10. As a hybrid direct presentation/pro bono coordination service provider, VAAP provides \nfull-scope direct representation to about 35-40 children each year through our two IJC UCP \nFellow positions. VAAP  also  mobilizes  limited  assistance for  dozens  more who  are \nderivative beneficiaries of primary asylum seeker clinics accessing pro bono services on a \nlimited basis in VAAP-coordinated attorney-for-the-day clinics.  \n11. Numerous judges, clerks, and staff of local state and immigration courts, as well as the \nDepartment of Homeland Security’s field office staff, have commended VAAP staff for \npromoting more streamlined, fair, and efficient through their legal work. For example, on \nseveral occasions Chelmsford and Boston Immigration Courts have thanked us for helping \nto prevent unnecessary status conferences, at least, and at best for giving previously \nunrepresented parties the precious chance to fully developing their clearly meritorious \nclaims for relief. Representing Vermont children also prevents the courts from interfacing \nwith confused respondents about their travels and allows Vermont respondents to appear \nefficiently via Webex video conferencing. \n12. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025.  \n \n13. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective on the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 083\n\n(112 of 956), Page 112 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 112 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 8\n \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n14. Through social media/word-of-mouth, VAAP staff Emma and Cameron were the first to \nbecome  aware  of  the  February  21  and  March  21  orders  threatening  their  funding, \nexacerbating the adverse impacts them and their clients. On February 21, the information \nVAAP staff received was incomplete and changing, and as their supervisor I was not \nequipped to either confirm or deny rumors until IJC provided written guidance a few hours \nlater, which they supplemented in the days that followed with a town halls for IJC hosts \nand a one-on-one meeting with me. On March 21, VAAP staff were first to learn about the \nnew order, doing so from their peer fellows hosted by other organizations. Again, I \nconfirmed shortly thereafter with IJC, this time in person since the order was issued while \nIJC was gathered in New York City for its inaugural alumni convening. \n15. This funding loss is devastating to VAAP’s financial picture. Currently, the number of \nimmigrant children VAAP currently represents under the CLIN2 subcontract is about 15 \nand growing, as our contract is new and VAAP was in the process of conducting outreach \nwith referring partners statewide to connect incoming children with us as counsel—an \nonerous piece of work considering Vermont lacks any in-state ORR detention. For context, \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement-originated funding, including but not limited to our CLIN2 \nsubcontract, accounts for about half of VAAP’s overall operating budget and accounts for \nabout 75% of the funding VAAP needs to host our two IJC UCP fellows. As a newer \norganization with limited cashflow and mostly reimbursement-based funding sources, \nVAAP cannot administer payroll without UCP contract funding, and may need to furlough \nits two IJC UCP fellows. Indeed, when the Stop-Work Order was first announced in \nFebruary, VAAP temporarily furloughed our two IJC UCP fellows effective immediately \ncausing financial harm to the fellow and to VAAP and legal harm to VAAP clients including \nchildren in proceedings. When IJC UCP Fellows are furloughed, I am rendered the sole \nremaining direct legal service practitioner on staff and must absorb two full-time caseloads \nin addition to my existing full-time administrative, fiscal, and professional duties. Only \nwith IJC’s commitment of an expedited reimbursement for expenses incurred last quarter \nplus an additional 30 days of prepaid funding for the month of March was VAAP able to \nrestore Emma and Cam to full-time after a 48-hour furlough. \n16. Notably, the February Stop-Work order conspicuously co-occurred with the  J.O.P. v. \nDepartment of Homeland Security class settlement deadline of February 24, 2025, the date \nwhen  unaccompanied  children  class  members  were  required  to  file  their  asylum \napplications with USCIS at pain of waving initial USCIS jurisdiction over their claims. \nVAAP staff were placed in the impossible posture of either working without pay to meet \nprofessional duties to several class member clients or leaving the work piled onto my \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 084\n\n(113 of 956), Page 113 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 113 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\n \ncatastrophically  overloaded  docket  at  risk  of  permanent  legal  harm  to  clients  and \nprofessional liability for VAAP. VAAP staff worked without pay to meet their child clients’ \ndeadlines, causing undue delay to their own contingency planning to replace lost income \nand prevent rent arrearage and loss of housing.  \n17. Moreover, since February, the threat to UCP funding has closed VAAP to new legal intakes, \nincluding for unaccompanied children in deportation proceedings. Intake closure comes at \na time when DHS is ramping up enforcement and detention activities in our northern border \nstate, causing an increasing volume of indigent Vermont children and youth to enter \nremoval proceedings in Boston and Chelmsford Immigration Courts without counsel.  \n18. For existing clients, VAAP staff describes the act of strategizing on individual cases or \nmanaging their overall dockets long term as “impossible,” since they are finishing each \nworkday without knowing whether they will be returning the next. Funding threats and \nassociated uncertainty of employment is threatening legal service quality and making it \ndifficult for VAAP staff to prioritize among increasing, overlapping case emergencies.  \n19. For example, one CLIN2 subcontract client from Sudan has a pending asylum application \nand an approved USCIS Form I-360 granting Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Prior to \nseeking refuge in Vermont, Sudanese law enforcement repeatedly refused to offer client \nwith protection from the physical and verbal attacks he faced for reasons relating to his \nnationality, ethnicity, and religion. The child client was being held in ORR custody for an \nextended period in a southern U.S. state, since the SIJS sponsoring organization required \nproof of counsel in Vermont before permitting the child to be released here. Client was on \nhis way to release to Vermont with VAAP’s offer of full-scope representation, which we \nhave suddenly rescinded considering this funding loss. The child clients’ navigation of \nremoval proceedings pro se from his unnecessarily prolonged detention hangs in the \nbalance.    \n20. Another CLIN2 subcontract client from Mexico has a pending asylum application and was \njust beginning the SIJS process when funding was cut. Prior to seeking refuge in Vermont, \nthe child witnessed neighbors, friends, and peers his age tortured and killed by cartel \nmembers and their families, and all were denied assistance by local police. When the client \nbegan receiving threats that the same would happen to him, he fled. Since arriving in the \nUnited States, a severe health condition and hospitalizations have made client’s court \nappearances literally impossible to access  without  resource-intensive  assistance from \ncounsel including home visits to his rural Vermont town. Resultantly, he was up against the \nJ-O-P- deadline to file his asylum application and receive the benefits to which he was \nentitled and nearly lost out in spite of his and counsel’s heroic efforts to overcome his health \ncondition and make his filing deadline. They were just able to submit client’s meritorious \nasylum application in time, despite the odds they were up against. Client will not be able \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 085\n\n(114 of 956), Page 114 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 114 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-7     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nto continue pursuing his applications for relief without counsel, given his young age and \nfragile health.  \n21. Yet another CLIN2 subcontract client from Mexico has a pending asylum application with \nan upcoming biometrics appointment. Prior to seeking refuge in Vermont, the now 10-year-\nold child’s uncle was murdered in his presence. The same group that murdered his uncle \nthreatened our child client and attempted his kidnapping, at which point he fled for his life \nto the United States. Unfortunately, our client and the family he reunited with in the United \nStates were then subjected to severe forms of labor trafficking. After all of this, our client \nmade his way to Vermont and had just managed to secure our representation and to file his \nasylum claim when funding was cut. This young child needs our legal assistance to access \nhis upcoming biometrics appointment, to understand and prepare evidence substantiating \nhis claims, and to share his story in an asylum interview. The child client will be unable to \ncomplete his interview without the assistance of counsel, as he is incredibly shy and has \neither panic attacks or breaks into inconsolable sobs when he attempts to speak about it.  \n22. The uncertainty of future funding has prompted VAAP’s difficult decision to not renew the \ncontract of the one paralegal advocacy/program coordination person on staff and eliminate \nthe position. Now, VAAP staff is shrinking from four to three, and potentially to one, at a \ntime when the complexity and volume of unmet legal service needs are increasing.  \n23. In the interest of prioritizing professional duties owed to child clients above all else, VAAP \nis also forgoing administrative work that would reimburse staff for work-related expenses \nand replace lost funding to sustain VAAP’s ongoing operations. My professional duties to \nclients and fiscal duties to the future of VAAP are now in direct conflict because of this \ncontract cancellation. As a result of these sudden, unplanned resource constraints, existing \nchild clients are waiting longer to hear back from VAAP regarding clients’ increasingly \nfrightened requests for clarification and assistance.  \n24. Without restored funding, I will likely be the only full-time attorney at VAAP within the \nnext four-to-six weeks, rendering me solely responsible for the firm’s existing attorney-\nclient duties as well as all existing fiscal and administrative ones. My resource constraints \nand conflicting professional and administrative duties would require me to keep our intake \nclosed and to withdraw from representation in all child clients’ removal proceedings. This \nwould irreparably harm clients’ legal claims for relief and increase their likelihood of \ndeportation, as there are no other legal service providers of this type serving Vermont. Harm \nto  VAAP  clients  is  harmful  to  VAAP’s  mission-based  staff.  That  said,  continued \nrepresentation of clients under ethical obligations without funding is also harmful to staff.  \n25. Even if VAAP can diversify funding at the last minute to prevent IJC UCP staff from \nbecoming re-furloughed because of contract cancellation, the harm of February’s stop-\nwork order continues to distract staff energy and drain organizational morale.

I certify under(cid:2271)penalty(cid:2271)of(cid:2271)perjury(cid:2271)that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(cid:2271)§(cid:2271)1746.  \n1.  My name is Marion Donovan-Kaloust, and I am the Director of Legal Services of the \nChildren’s  Representation  Project  (“CRP”)  at  Immigrant  Defenders  Law  Center \n(“ImmDef”), where I have been employed for almost ten years. ImmDef is a non-profit \norganization headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with additional offices in Santa \nAna, Riverside and San Diego. ImmDef believes in providing universal representation so \nthat no immigrant is forced to face removal proceedings without an attorney or accredited \nrepresentative  at  their  side.  ImmDef  is  the  largest  provider  of  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied children in California and currently provides legal services to children \nhoused  in  seventeen  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement  (“ORR”)  facilities  throughout \nSouthern California. ImmDef also represents thousands of unaccompanied children who \nhave been released from ORR and are residing with sponsors in the Greater Los Angeles \narea.  \n2.  ImmDef’s mission and vision is  that  no immigrant  should have to face deportation \nproceedings alone. We believe that every person facing removal deserves to have zealous, \ncompetent counsel at their side. We represent approximately 3,100 noncitizens annually in \ntheir removal proceedings and provide other legal services to  approximately 33,000 \nadditional noncitizens. We provide pro bono representation and other legal services to \nunaccompanied minor children, indigent detained adults, individuals deemed mentally \nincompetent to represent themselves, deported veterans, and families separated at the \nborder, among others. Our CRP program is the largest of our departments and has primary \nresponsibility for carrying out this mission and vision as it relates to unaccompanied \nchildren. \n3.  In  order  to  carry  out  its  mission,  ImmDef’s  CRP  program  has  several  main  work \ncomponents: (1) Providing legal education “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations, \nconducting  individual  consultations  (legal  screenings),  and  making  referrals  to  legal \nservice providers for detained children who will not remain in our service area, as well as \nChild Advocate referrals and appearing as Friend of Court for unrepresented detained \nchildren;  (2)  Representing  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in \nimmigration proceedings, including children who have been released to sponsors, and those \nresiding in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (“URM”) program; and (3) Representing \nchildren in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. We represent children in short-term \nORR custody as well as children who have been placed in long-term foster care settings. \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 089\n\n(118 of 956), Page 118 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 118 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 9\nWe  further  host  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  (“IJC”)  fellows  to  represent  released \nunaccompanied children in removal proceedings and provide Spanish-language tutoring \nfor non-Spanish speaking staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  ImmDef has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nCalifornia since 2015. Providing legal services to unaccompanied children has always been \nat the core of ImmDef’s work. In 2024 alone, we provided KYRs and legal screenings to \nover 3,750 children and made over 4,200 referrals for legal services. We offered full-scope \nrepresentation to over 670 detained children and to over 175 children who had been \nreleased from ORR custody, including children placed in the URM program. ImmDef \ncurrently represents over 1,900 unaccompanied children in their removal proceedings \nunder the UCP contract.   \n5.  Of our staff of over 200, ImmDef has hired approximately 113 staff funded with U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding dedicated to providing legal \nservices  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children.  Specifically,  ImmDef’s  CRP  project \nemploys forty-three attorneys, four IJC Attorney Fellows, and thirty-eight non-attorney \nsupport staff providing direct representation services. We also employ twenty-five Program \nAssociates and Program Coordinators with primary responsibility for providing KYRs, \nlegal screenings and referrals for detained children.   \n6.  ImmDef staff providing representation and non-representation legal services (such as \nKYRs and legal screenings to children) in ORR-subcontracted facilities regularly travel to \neach such facility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for hearings, and \nprovide legal education and individual consultations. Our team visits each of the thirteen \nshort-term ORR subcontracted facilities whenever there are new arrivals, as well as when \nchildren in care need follow-up legal services (typically resulting in weekly facility visits). \nAttorneys also regularly visit children detained in each of the four long-term foster care \nprograms we serve to help them pursue their immigration cases. The vast majority of \nchildren we serve have fled dangerous circumstances in their home countries, including \ntrafficking, child abuse and neglect, and community violence. Take for example some of \nour clients—a 16-year-old girl, and her one-year-old son. Beginning at the age of six years-\nold, our older client was sex trafficked by her own family in Mexico.  After giving birth to \nher son, she fled to the U.S. to save him from the same fate. \n7.  Our office represents children like these pro bono in their removal proceedings, including \nrepresentation before immigration courts and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services \n(“USCIS”). We also represent children before the California Superior Court in connection \nwith applications for Special Immigrant Juvenile Findings (which are necessary to apply \nfor Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, a form of immigration protection available to \nchildren who have experienced abuse, abandonment or neglect). We pursue victim-based \nrelief such as asylum, T-nonimmigrant status for victims of trafficking, U-nonimmigrant \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 090\n\n(119 of 956), Page 119 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 119 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 9\nstatus  for  children  who  have  experienced  crimes  in  the  United  States,  and  Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status, as well as litigating any other relief for which the children may \nbe eligible   \n8.  For detained children, we play a key role in advocating with ORR-subcontracted facilities \nand other stakeholders to ensure that children’s needs are being met while in ORR custody.  \nFor example, we make referrals to Child Advocates, advocate directly with ORR to avoid \nunnecessary “step ups” for children at risk of being placed in more restrictive detention \nsettings, and request Trafficking Victim designations from the Office of Trafficking in \nPersons. Because we are an independent, non-governmental organization, children often \nshare concerns with us they do not feel comfortable sharing with ORR-subcontracted staff \nor other stakeholders.  Thus, we are key voices for detained children—ensuring their rights \nare respected and their needs are being met while in care.  As an example, I once met with \na detained child who was wearing a thick, hooded sweatshirt with the hood up in 95+ \ndegree weather. When I asked her about it, she explained that her Muslim faith required \nher to cover her hair, but the ORR-subcontracted facility had not provided her with head \ncoverings. ImmDef was able to advocate for her religious rights to be respected and her \ncultural needs met. Every day there are new similar examples of our life-saving and life-\naffirming work.  \n9.  The children we serve range in age from infants to teenagers, and the vast majority are \nindigent (which is unsurprising given that they are children). Children, especially detained \nchildren, are still recovering from their journey and have yet to reach a place of security \nand permanency. Our team must often conduct multiple meetings with children to build \ntrust and rapport. We also serve children from diverse geographic, linguistic and cultural \nbackgrounds. While most of our staff are bilingual in Spanish and English, in recent years, \nwe have seen an increase of children from non-majority-Spanish-speaking countries, who \nrequire interpretation in order for their stories to be told and their rights to be vindicated. \nWe also often serve indigenous children from Mexico, Guatemala and Ecuador who \nsimilarly require interpretation into a Mayan language or Quechua. The vast majority of \nchildren  we  serve  have  also  experienced  significant  trauma,  whether  in  their  home \ncountries, on the journey to the United States, or at the hands of U.S. Immigration Officials \n(or all three). As a result of these factors, ImmDef’s staff is highly trained to conduct our \nservices using child-friendly, trauma-informed and culturally responsive methods. Due to \nthese same factors, the children cannot be expected to represent themselves in immigration \ncourt, nor can they expect to rely on a private attorney who may charge much more than \nthey can afford, and who may lack the training and linguistic or cultural responsiveness to \neffectively represent them.  \n10. We also serve children detained in remote ORR-subcontracted facilities, far from the Los \nAngeles city center. As ORR-subcontracted bed capacity expanded in the last several years, \nImmDef was repeatedly tapped to serve children in the more remote facilities because no \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 091\n\n(120 of 956), Page 120 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 120 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 9\nother attorneys would agree to travel to those distant locations. Because of ImmDef’s \nmission and vision, and our expertise serving unaccompanied children, we agreed to take \non the work—we refused to leave children unserved, even though doing so stretched our \ncapacity. It would be unreasonable to expect that these children’s needs might be met by \nthe private bar in these underserved regions—we have seen in practice that it cannot be \ndone. \n11.  Finally, immigration is an exceedingly complex area of law that changes rapidly. Our legal \nstaff is constantly monitoring changes in case law, listservs, the news, and government \nannouncements to ensure we have up-to-date information to provide the best representation \nfor our clients. Children cannot be expected to navigate our complicated legal immigration \nsystem on their own. In fact, when ImmDef has worked with pro bono attorneys to provide \nlegal representation for children, we have found that even licensed attorneys who are not \nspecialized in this area of law need intensive training and support to be able to effectively \nrepresent their clients.   \n12. This work has resulted not only in children stabilizing their legal status but stabilizing their \nlives. Without the looming anxiety of removal proceedings, we have seen children thrive. \nOne of our clients, a youth from West Africa who faced parental abandonment and \npersecution in his home country, recently received a full-ride athletic scholarship to \ncollege.  \n13. While our work often results in positive outcomes for our child clients, we have also seen \nthat government stakeholders benefit from our work. Since its founding in 2015, ImmDef \nhas staffed the Detained Juvenile Docket, currently held on Wednesday afternoons at Santa \nAna Immigration Court. Our presence both as counsel for detained children, as well as \nFriend of Court for unrepresented children, makes the hearings run much more efficiently.  \nJudges are not required to painstakingly attempt to explain immigration law or next steps \nto children—rather, they can move quickly through hearings, because the children are \nassisted in the matters by counsel or Friend of Court. Over the years, ImmDef has appeared \nbefore multiple Immigration Judges who preside over the Detained Juvenile Docket, and \neach has expressed their gratitude for our pro bono assistance on the cases. \n14. We  have  also  developed  strong  stakeholder  relationships  with  ORR  Federal  Field \nSpecialists and ORR-subcontracted facility staff. As ORR and the subcontracted facility \nwork to care for the children, ImmDef provides key information to the children about the \nnext steps in their immigration processes and reassurances about what’s to come.  We have \noften heard from ORR-subcontracted staff that receiving appropriate immigration advice \nalleviates children’s anxiety and stress. Further, as mentioned above, we are often able to \nhelp ORR staff and ORR-subcontracted facility staff identify issues the children are facing, \nbecause children may feel more comfortable sharing these concerns with a third party.  \nWhether it’s a child sharing that they have not been provided with sufficient clean clothing, \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 092\n\n(121 of 956), Page 121 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 121 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 9\nor that they have been subjected to sexual abuse in care, our ability to note these issues and \nraise them appropriately means that children are better protected, and ORR is able to \nurgently respond to pressing needs. Over the years, we have worked alongside multiple \nFederal Field Specialists in the greater Los Angeles region who have expressed that they \nrely on and trust us to raise issues that may be occurring at the subcontracted facilities. In \nsome cases, our notifications led ORR to investigate and take corrective action against \nsubcontracted facilities.   \n15. We have also developed positive working relationships with Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”) attorneys. For example, \nwhen children who were previously enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocol (“MPP”) \nstarted entering ORR-subcontracted facilities in 2019, the government was not adequately \ntracking them. Through our work in ORR-subcontracted facilities, ImmDef was able to \nidentify these children and notify OPLA of their presence in ORR custody before they \nreceived an in absentia order for failing to appear at their immigration hearings in MPP.  A \nchild being ordered removed for failing to appear at a hearing through no fault of their own \nbecause they were in federal custody in a distant location is an illogical outcome all parties \nwanted to avoid.   \n16. The arrival of MPP-impacted children into ORR custody was just one instance when \nImmDef stepped in to fill a gap in communication between government agencies. During \nthe “Zero Tolerance” policy in 2017 and 2018, when  children were routinely being \nseparated from their parents, we found that ORR-subcontracted facilities often did not \nknow where parents were detained or how to contact them. ImmDef played a key role in \nlocating separated parents for children’s case managers to ensure that parents and children \nhad contact, and that ORR knew where parents were being held. More recently, we have \nseen the same pattern play out, with parents being separated from their children because \nthey are serving as material witnesses, because of hospitalizations, or for a number of other \nreasons. ImmDef has been the first to identify the separation and flag it for ORR, to locate \nthe separated parent, and to assist in troubleshooting barriers to communication between \nthe child and parent in multiple instances. Thus, we have seen that ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities often rely on ImmDef to bridge gaps in communication or tracking of families \nbetween government agencies that interact with the children. \n17. On March 21, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) partially terminated \nthe  current  contract  with Acacia  Center  for  Justice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a \nsubcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  children.  Effective \nimmediately, HHS’ terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line \nNumbers (CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children as well as \nother non-representation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2, and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 093\n\n(122 of 956), Page 122 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 122 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 9\nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than “the \nGovernment’s convenience.”  \n18. At around 8:15 AM on Friday March 21, our office received an email from the Acacia \nCenter for Justice notifying us of the contract termination they had received from the \nDepartment of the Interior. ImmDef staff was already in our offices, on the way to hearings, \nand preparing to meet with detained clients.  Our work was unable to stop as requested due \nto our ethical responsibilities under California Attorney Ethics rules to zealously represent \nour clients and avoid prejudice to their cases.    \n19.  Over the ten years that ImmDef has participated in the contract, ImmDef has built an active \nclient caseload of 1,900 clients and has represented nearly 4,000 children in total.  We have \nprovided non-representation legal services to over 25,000 children.  We hired staff and \nopened satellite offices to meet the demands of contract deliverables and ensure children \nin need were being served. While no individual contract year was ever guaranteed, we \nrelied on the fact that these services are mandated in the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act  (“TVPRA”)  and  the  multi-year  nature  of  the  contract  to  make \ndecisions regarding our organization’s growth.  The abrupt termination of the contract puts \nthe organization as a whole in peril.  Funding impacted by the contract termination makes \nup approximately 55% of ImmDef’s budget.   \n20. As mentioned above, we employ 113 of our approximately 200-person staff under this \ngrant.  While we have limited flexible funding that has allowed us to continue to employ \nstaff  to  discharge  our  ethical  responsibilities  to  our  clients  following  the  contract \ntermination  we  cannot  continue  for  long  without  reinstatement  of  unaccompanied \nchildren’s funding.  Our current reserves will be completely exhausted within six months, \nand  dramatic  cuts  in  staffing  will  be  needed  well  before  that  to  avoid  completely \nbankrupting the organization. In fact, we have already had to provide 27 staff with layoff \nnotices in response to the contract termination. Further, before the contract termination, our \nreserves were intended to fund other mission-focused work such as providing pro se clinics \nto new arrivals and rapid response to immigration raids.  Reallocating those reserves to \nfund the children’s work would have negative ripple effects across our entire organization. \nWe have taken additional steps to prevent further dipping into our reserves, including \nstopping any non-essential support for clients, such as helping to pay for medical exams \nneeded for adjustment of status applications, and putting a pause on all non-essential office \nsupply purchases. \n21. As reserves run out, we would have to take drastic action to terminate staff across all \npositions funded under this contract.  As mentioned, we have already sent layoff notices to \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 094\n\n(123 of 956), Page 123 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 123 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 9\n27 staff, but additional layoffs would be necessary were the funding not restored. These \ncuts would be incompatible with our ethical responsibilities to the over 1,900 child clients \nwe currently represent. We have limited ability to retrain and reassign staff to other \nprograms under other funding sources.  Prior to each grant or contract year, agreements are \noutlined, and existing staff are identified within each program for the contract or grant year, \nwhich  results  in  little  room  for  unexpected  shifts  in  already  approved  budgets. \nRestructuring  other grants  to  absorb  unaccompanied  children’s  staff  mid-year  is  not \nfeasible, and we don’t have the capacity or the ability to absorb over 1,900 cases into other \nattorneys’ caseloads. Furthermore, retraining staff takes time and resources—resources that \nour organization does not have without this funding.  \n22. Additional furloughs and layoffs are inevitable if we are not able to restore funding. \nHowever, as mentioned—we have over 1,900 open children’s cases. Laying off staff \nfunded under this grant would prevent us from competently representing our existing child \nclients.  In response to a prior stop work order, we instituted a hiring freeze, which will \nremain ongoing in light of the contract cancelation.  There are open positions of case-\ncarrying attorneys and paralegals that we cannot fill, putting additional strain on a team \nthat will be further exacerbated in light of the contract termination. \n23. The contract termination presents an immediate existential threat to ImmDef’s existence \nand to our mission. The contract termination froze, without notice, funding to represent \nnearly 2000 children with whom we undertook attorney-client relationships in reliance on \nthat funding. These cases are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly \nskilled attorneys to competently handle them. For example, our office filed an asylum \napplication for one youth from West Africa in February 2025. He. is currently awaiting an \ninterview with the asylum office. As a speaker of a language from the Niger-Congo \nlanguage family, his case requires specialized translations and in-depth country conditions \nresearch. His case could be pending before the asylum office for years, and without \nrepresentation at the ready, he risks having to present his asylum case before USCIS alone.  \n24. Currently, we have over twenty-five immigration and state court hearings for children \nwhose representation is funded under the contract scheduled in the week following the \ncontract termination, including one for a 4-year-old child from Mexico. It would be \nimpossible to withdraw from these cases on such short notice without seriously prejudicing \nour clients—if the courts would even allow us to do so.  \n25. It has been a full-time job, as the leader of our Children’s Representation Project, to field \nquestions from staff about what the abrupt contract termination means for them and for \ntheir clients. It has been a challenge to keep staff focused on representing clients while they \nunderstandably feel panic about whether they will even have a job tomorrow. While we \ncontinue to provide key non-representational services and represent existing clients, the \ncontract termination has forced us to stop offering new representation to children currently \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 095\n\n(124 of 956), Page 124 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 124 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-8     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 9\ndetained. At  this  very  moment,  there  are  children  in  ORR  custody  who  need  our \nrepresentation who are not receiving it. This means that children who want voluntary \ndeparture will have their return home unacceptably delayed, victims of trafficking will not \nbe able to access the protections they deserve, and children fleeing persecution will not be \nable to have their day in court. These impacts are unacceptable to an organization founded \non the belief that no child—some of whose feet don’t even touch the floor when they sit in \ncourt—should have to face a trained government prosecutor alone. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 24 of March 2025, in Riverside, California.          \n            \n \n___________________________  \nMarion (\"Mickey\") Donovan-Kaloust \nImmigrant Defenders Law Center \n634 S.

My  name  is  Joel  Frost-Tift,  and  I  am  the  Senior  Supervising  Attorney  of  the \nUnaccompanied Children’s Team at Public Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm in \nLos Angeles dedicated to advancing civil rights and racial and economic justice, as well as \nto amplifying the power of our clients through comprehensive legal advocacy. Public \nCounsel is one of the primary organizations dedicated to providing legal services to \nindigent unaccompanied immigrant children who are released from Office of Refugee \nResettlement (ORR) custody throughout the greater Los Angeles area.  \n2.  The Unaccompanied Children’s team is the largest of four teams within the Immigrants’ \nRights  Project  at  Public  Counsel. The  Immigrants’  Rights  Project  practices  holistic, \ntrauma-informed advocacy, recognizing that our clients come to us with extraordinary \nstrengths, but also vulnerability due to the violence many have experienced through forced \nmigration and our dysfunctional immigration system. Our team of advocates collaborates \nwith immigrant clients and communities to fight fearlessly for legal protections and a just \nimmigration system. \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, Public Counsel represents unaccompanied children who \nare not in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. We further host Immigrant Justice \nCorps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings and \nprovide Spanish-language tutoring for staff representing unaccompanied children. \n4.  Public Counsel has been providing legal services for unaccompanied children funded by \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in the greater Los Angeles area \nsince 2014. Public Counsel serves around 200 unaccompanied children each year.  \n5.  Public Counsel currently has 14 staff members funded by HHS who are dedicated to \nproviding legal services to unaccompanied children. They are a supervising attorney, a \nprogram  manager,  six  staff  attorneys,  one  IJC  fellow,  one  social  worker,  one  case \ncoordinator, and three paralegals.  \n6.  Public Counsel provides full scope representation, which includes representation in state \ncourts, in removal proceedings before the immigration court, in appellate proceedings \nbefore the Board of Immigration Appeals, in petitions for review in the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit, and in applications for affirmative humanitarian relief like \nasylum  and  Special  Immigrant  Juvenile  Status  before  USCIS.  Our  staff  frequently \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 098\n\n(127 of 956), Page 127 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 127 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-9     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 4\nrepresent clients in the Los Angeles, Orange County, and Van Nuys immigration courts, \nthe Los Angeles Asylum Office, and state courts in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, \nRiverside, Ventura and  Santa Barbara counties. We also provide  Know Your Rights \nservices to communities throughout Southern California.  \n7.  Public Counsel has witnessed pro se children in court struggle to articulate their claims due \nto their age, language barriers, and the complexity of immigration law. Most of these \nchildren cannot afford private attorneys, so the loss of the HHS funding would prove \ndevastating for them since it would greatly decrease the number of providers who could \nrepresent them.  \n8.  Our  Unaccompanied  Children’s  team  receives  referrals  from  existing  clients,  the \ncommunity, and the online Acacia Center for Justice referral database system. Once we \nreceive a referral we conduct a brief phone screening, followed by a more in-depth intake \nbefore initiating representation of a child by signing a representation agreement. When we \nhave capacity to take on cases, we accept all cases that are eligible under HHS funding \nguidelines where the child resides within our service area.  \n9.  Immigration judges have often expressed gratitude to Public Counsel for the efficiency we \nbring to their dockets, and they have referred children to Public Counsel. They have \nremarked to our clients that they are lucky to have such quality representation.  \n10. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all four Contract Line Numbers (CLINs) of the \ncontract for which Public Counsel is a subcontractor of the Acacia Center for Justice: (1) \nKYR presentations and legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities; (2) Legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children not in ORR custody; (3) Legal representation \nfor unaccompanied  children in ORR custody;  and (4) Spanish-language tutoring  for \norganizational staff who work with children. Without further elaboration on duration or \nreasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain in place until you are notified \notherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside of your control and should not \nbe misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n11. Members of Public Counsel learned of the stop work order suddenly on February 18, 2025, \nwhen we received communications from the Acacia Center for Justice and from the Center \nfor Gender and Refugee Studies abruptly informing us that trainings and officer hours had \nbeen cancelled. Then, just as suddenly, HHS rescinded the stop work order on February 21, \n2025. \n12. On March 21, 2025, again without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated this same contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice for which Public Counsel is a subcontractor. This termination was effective the \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 099\n\n(128 of 956), Page 128 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 128 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-9     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 4\nsame day, March 21, 2025. HHS terminated the contract with respect to three of the four \nContract Line Numbers CLINs: (1) CLIN2, Legal representation for unaccompanied \nchildren not in ORR custody; (2) CLIN3, Legal representation for unaccompanied children \nin ORR custody; and (3) CLIN4, Spanish-language tutoring for organizational staff who \nwork with children. For now, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe partial termination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors—which includes Public \nCounsel—to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification \nfor the partial termination other than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n13. HHS provides about $1 million per year in funding for 14 of the 15 staff members on Public \nCounsel’s  Unaccompanied  Children’s  Team.  This  accounts  for  about  5%  of  Public \nCounsel’s annual operating budget. Without this funding, we will be unable to maintain \nthis staffing of the Unaccompanied Children’s team. This loss of staff would have a \ndevastating impact on our ability to continue to represent unaccompanied children.  \n14. The partial contract termination and the uncertainty of continued HHS funding have had a \nserious deleterious effect on morale within the organization. Members of our staff have \nstated their intention to look for other jobs because of the need for reliable continued \nemployment. The anxiety that the  partial contract termination and the uncertainty has \ncaused our staff as well as the time we have devoted to contingency planning have impacted \nour ability to focus squarely on representing our clients. In addition, we are unable to take \non new clients due to the funding uncertainty.  \n15. Children without representation are much more likely to be denied relief and ordered \nremoved to countries where they fear harm, contrary to Public Counsel’s mission of \nadvancing civil rights and justice for all.  \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 22nd of March 2025, in Burbank, CA.           \n            \n_______________________________  \nSenior Supervising Attorney \nUnaccompanied Children’s Team \nPublic Counsel \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 100\n\n(129 of 956), Page 129 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 129 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 6\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF VANESSA \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nGUTIERREZ (NWIRP) IN SUPPORT OF \n \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and correct pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Vanessa Gutierrez, and I am the Deputy Director at Northwest Immigrant \nRights Project (“NWIRP”) who oversees NWIRP’s Unaccompanied Children Program \n(“UCP”). NWIRP provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth \nwho have been released from Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody to sponsors \nthroughout Washington State.  \n3.  NWIRP has provided legal services through UCP since 2022. We expanded to provide In-\nPerson Post-Release Legal Services to children and youth released from emergency ORR \nfacilities in 2023, and we expanded again to provide representation to youth entering the \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 102\n\n(131 of 956), Page 131 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 131 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 6\nURM program in February 2025. NWIRP has over 500 open UCP cases in which we are \nproviding direct legal representation to unaccompanied children and youth released from \nORR custody. \n4.  With funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), NWIRP \ncurrently has 20.9 full-time equivalent (FTE) staff members dedicated to providing direct \nlegal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth. Specifically, we have a \ndirecting attorney, 3.65 FTE supervising attorneys, 8.7 FTE staff attorneys, 7 FTE legal \nadvocates, and one social services advocate. In addition to these staff, NWIRP has three \nFTE Immigrant Justice Corps (IJC) fellow attorneys who provide direct representation for \nunaccompanied children and youth in removal proceedings.  \n5.  NWIRP UCP staff represent unaccompanied children and youth in removal proceedings in \nimmigration  court,  BIA  appeals,  affirmative  relief  before  USCIS  (including  asylum, \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile (SIJ) classification, Adjustment of Status, T visas and U visas), \nand state court cases (including dependencies, minor guardianships, parenting plans, and \nvulnerable youth guardianships). Staff must regularly travel to the Seattle Immigration \nCourt, and occasionally the Portland Immigration Court, as well as state courts throughout \nWashington for court filings and hearings.  \n6.  NWIRP’s UCP Program provides critical legal services to unaccompanied children and \nyouth, who are not guaranteed appointment of counsel in removal proceedings. Most \nunaccompanied children and youth in our state lack the financial resources to be able to \nhire private immigration attorneys. There are not many attorneys in Washington state who \nprovide representation in removal proceedings for unaccompanied children and youth or \nin state court for SIJ-eligible children and youth, especially on a low bono or pro bono \nbasis. Due to their young age (we have represented UCP clients as young as 1 year old), \nthe  trauma  they  may  have  experienced,  language  barriers,  and  the  complexity  of \nimmigration law, it is not realistic to expect unaccompanied children and youth to attempt \nto apply for immigration relief before USCIS, pursue state court cases, or advocate for \nthemselves in immigration court without an attorney.  \n7.  NWIRP successfully serves children and youth in rural and urban areas of Washington \nState. When we receive a referral for a UCP-eligible child, we direct the referral to the UCP \nteam at the NWIRP office that covers the county where the child lives and schedule an \nindividual  consultation.  If  the  child  would  like  NWIRP  to  represent  them  in  their \nimmigration case, we accept their case on a universal representation basis, without regard \nfor the type of relief they may qualify for or the strength of their case. We then assign their \ncase to an attorney, or a legal advocate working in collaboration with an attorney. When \npossible, for children and youth who are eligible for SIJ classification, we try to place their \nstate court case with a pro bono attorney. We regularly engage in pro bono recruitment and \nmentorship, and we periodically offer training to pro bono attorneys. When NWIRP is \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 103\n\n(132 of 956), Page 132 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 132 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 6\nunable to find a pro bono attorney, we take on the state court case in-house. We provide \nin-house representation on the immigration case before the immigration court and USCIS.  \n8.  For  most  of  NWIRP’s  UCP  clients,  we  represent  them  in  their  first  appearance  in \nimmigration court. Many of our UCP clients have never been to any court ever in their life \nbefore their first immigration court hearing. Before their hearing, their assigned NWIRP \nattorney meets with them to explain what to expect during the hearing, including who will \nbe present, what the layout of the courtroom will be, what the immigration judge may ask \nduring the hearing, what their NWIRP advocate may say on their behalf, and what some \npossible outcomes of their hearing may be. We review the factual allegations and charges \nof  removability  in  their  Notice  to  Appear  with  them,  and  we  review  the  forms  of \nimmigration relief that we have already discussed with them, making sure they fully \nunderstand and that we answer any questions they have. This preparation helps put the \nchild or youth more at ease, helps ensure their presence at their scheduled hearing, and \nhelps the hearing run more efficiently and smoothly because the child better understands \nwhat is happening. \n9.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  four  Contract  Line  Numbers  (CLINs). \nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February \n21, 2025. Even this short lapse in funding negatively impacted NWIRP’s UCP work. The \nstop work order created confusion among staff over how to categorize and memorialize the \nwork they continued to do on behalf of our clients, adding extra timekeeping requirements \nthat took away valuable time that could have been spent advocating for clients. During the \nstop  work  order,  we  continued  the  direct  representation  and  legal  services  without \ninterruption, as ethically required by the Rules of Professional Conduct in Washington \nState, but we did not know if we would ever be reimbursed for our work while the stop \nwork order was in effect. Even after NWIRP submitted a Request for Equitable Adjustment  \nfor the work completed while the stop work order was in effect, it was communicated to \nNWIRP that our submissions are “not” official invoices and that our submission “does not” \nguarantee reimbursement and we were told that it “will ultimately be decided by the \ngovernment.” \n10. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers (CLINs):   \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 104\n\n(133 of 956), Page 133 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 133 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 6\nCLIN2,  Legal  representation  for  unaccompanied  children  as  well  as  other  non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children.   \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and \nconfidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. For NWIRP, this results in a full termination of our entire UCP contract. \nHHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than “the Government’s \nconvenience.”  \n11. NWIRP learned about this contract termination through an email communication from \nAcacia Center for Justice, sent at 8:15 a.m. on March 21, 2025 to NWIRP’s Executive \nDirector, Malou Chávez. The title of the email was “Urgent: Notice of Partial Termination \nfor the Government’s Convenience.” Acacia hosted a meeting for further discussion of the \ncontract termination. \n12. While NWIRP is still considering how to respond to the contract termination, we are \ncommitted to continuing to represent existing clients, at least in the short term. Our \norganization’s ability to continue representing clients long-term depends on many factors, \nincluding whether any case continuity funding might be available to support the winding \ndown of the contract through HHS. \n13. UCP funding represents approximately 10% of NWIRP’s overall annual budget. Loss of \nfunding impacts 28 staff (20.9 FTEs) at NWIRP. Over the short-term, NWIRP aims to \nmaintain all positions to ensure continuity of representation. The organization will do so \nby borrowing from its reserves and by seeking support from donors and is currently in the \nprocess of determining how long this solution will sustain the services previously funded \nby the UCP contract. Sustaining services will cost NWIRP at least $200,000 per month. \nSince NWIRP provides extensive legal services beyond its UCP contract, it must consider \nall of its mission-focused work when determining use of limited reserve funding or donor \nresources. Any funds that NWIRP directs to sustain services under this contract take away \nfrom other critical services that NWIRP is committed to providing in the community, \nespecially during this period of exponentially-increased demand for immigration legal \nservices. We anticipate that NWIRP will be unable to sustain services over the long-term \nand will need to reduce its staff accordingly. \n14. The UCP contract termination detrimentally impacts NWIRP’s mission to promote justice \nby defending and advancing the rights of immigrants through direct legal services, systemic \nadvocacy, and community education. Research has shown that unrepresented children and \nyouth are more likely to be issued an order of removal, even if they have a strong \nimmigration claim, demonstrating the high need for legal representation in these cases. \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 105\n\n(134 of 956), Page 134 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 134 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-10     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 6\nWhile NWIRP aims to continue representation in as many cases as possible, we will have \nextremely limited capacity to assist children and youth who need representation in the \nfuture,  negatively  impacting  their  chances  of  gaining  immigration  relief  and  likely \nchanging the trajectory of their lives.  \n15. Having to turn away youth from services is difficult for our committed legal staff, many of \nwhom are immigrants themselves and share an understanding of the experiences the \nchildren and youth are facing. Contract termination will undoubtedly negatively impact the \nmorale of staff who already work under challenging conditions in the immigration system. \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the District of Columbia that the foregoing is \ntrue and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 21st of March 2025, in Wenatchee, Washington.          \n            \n_______________________________  \nVanessa Gutierrez \nDeputy Director \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project  \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 106\n\n(135 of 956), Page 135 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 135 of 956\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ASHLEY T. \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nHARRINGTON (RMIAN) IN SUPPORT \n \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nPlaintiffs, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \nv.

HARRINGTON \nCHILDREN’S PROGRAM MANAGING ATTORNEY FOR THE \nROCKY MOUNTAIN IMMIGRANT ADVOCACY NETWORK \nI, Ashley T. Harrington make the following statements on behalf of the Rocky Mountain \nImmigrant Advocacy Network.  I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is \ntrue and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746. \n1. My name is Ashley T. Harrington, and I am the Children’s Program Managing Attorney at \nthe Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”). RMIAN is a Colorado-\nbased nonprofit organization that provides free immigration legal and social services to \nindividuals in civil immigration detention, as well as to immigrant children and families. \nThrough its staff attorneys, paralegals, social workers, and a network of hundreds of pro \nbono attorneys, RMIAN provides legal education and free legal representation to low-\nincome immigrants who otherwise would not be able to afford an attorney.\n2. RMIAN’s primary programs are 1) the Detention Program which provides free legal \nservices to individuals in civil detention; 2) the Children’s Program which provides free \nlegal services to children and families in immigration proceedings; and 3) the Social \nService  project  which  provides  comprehensive  supportive  services  to  particularly \nvulnerable individuals, children and families.\n3. RMIAN is the primary organization dedicated to providing legal services to indigent \nunaccompanied immigrant children in Colorado. Specifically, RMIAN provides free legal \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children who have been released from the Office of \nRefugee Resettlement (“ORR”) to sponsors, to unaccompanied children who have been \nplaced in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program, and to unaccompanied children in \nORR Long-Term Foster Care. RMIAN previously also provided free legal services to \nchildren in ORR short-term shelters in Colorado.\n4. RMIAN has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nColorado through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding since \nthe first ORR short-term shelter opened in Colorado in 2019. RMIAN provided know-\nyour-rights presentations, individual legal screenings, legal representation and referrals to \nhundreds of youth in ORR custody in Colorado from December 2019 through May 2023 \nwhen the shelters closed.\n5. RMIAN has continued providing representation to unaccompanied children who were \nreleased from ORR custody—both from the shelters in Colorado as well as shelters all over \nthe country. With HHS funding, RMIAN is currently representing 160 unaccompanied \nchildren, including unaccompanied children released to individual sponsors and children \nreleased into the Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program. In addition, RMIAN recently\n1\nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 108\n\n(137 of 956), Page 137 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 137 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nexpanded its services to provide representation to children in the ORR Long-Term Foster \nCare program placed in Colorado.  \n6.  With HHS funding, RMIAN currently employs approximately six full-time-equivalent \nstaff dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children. This \nincludes a managing attorney, staff attorneys, a law clerk, coordinators, a paralegal, and an \nadministrative assistant.   \n7.  RMIAN represents unaccompanied children in removal proceedings in immigration court \nand in humanitarian relief applications before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nincluding  asylum, Special  Immigrant  Juvenile Status,  U and T nonimmigrant  status, \nadjustment of status to lawful permanent residency, and applications for employment \nauthorization. In addition, RMIAN staff attorneys and pro bono partners represent children \nin state court proceedings, including guardianship, allocation of parental responsibilities \nand child welfare proceedings.   \n8.  RMIAN has initiated representation with unaccompanied children as young as two years \nup to those on the eve of their eighteenth birthday. None of these children are fluent in \nEnglish or have received higher education. These children’s cases require navigating a \ncomplicated maze of laws and legal processes necessary to secure lawful status and defend \nfrom  deportation.  Most  require  analysis  of  both  state  and  federal  laws  and  require \nsimultaneous applications and motions before the immigration court, a State court and U.S. \nCitizenship  and  Immigration  Services.  Each  of  these  forums  have  specific,  detailed \nprocedures that must be followed to ensure cases don’t result in rejection or denial. \nChildren’s legal cases often take several years to ultimately result in lawful permanent \nresidency, requiring constant monitoring and regular required filings during the lengthy \nprocess. It would be virtually impossible for a child to successfully navigate all the \nrequirements to avoid deportation and successfully obtain lawful status without an attorney.  \n9.  The unaccompanied children RMIAN represents have often been through complex and \nsignificant trauma. Many of RMIAN’s child clients have been subjected to sex and labor \ntrafficking, child abuse, neglect and abandonment, sexual abuse and other violence. Many \nof  the  applications  for  legal  protection  require  detailed  declarations  and  interviews \nregarding the trauma and abuse these children have endured—something that would be \nincredibly difficult to endure without a trauma-informed attorney’s assistance.  \n10. RMIAN’s services are not only beneficial to the children in removal proceedings, but also \nto immigration judges, court staff and government attorneys. RMIAN has built strong \nrelationships with Denver’s immigration judges and staff as well as attorneys for the \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA). \nRMIAN routinely meets with immigration judges and staff along with OPLA to discuss \nhow to improve services and efficiency. RMIAN has worked jointly with OPLA to request \nand  obtain  dismissal  of  removal  proceedings  for  dozens  of  unaccompanied  children \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 109\n\n(138 of 956), Page 138 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 138 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\npursuing relief applications with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, thereby \npreserving the court and OPLA’s time and resources for cases ripe for resolution by the \ncourt. In addition, when a RMIAN attorney enters their appearance with the immigration \ncourt, typically the next hearing is cancelled and written deadlines are provided, thereby \nsaving the court’s limited time for other cases. RMIAN routinely receives requests from \nimmigration court staff and judges to assist unaccompanied children and families with \nanything from a change of address form to a screening for potential human trafficking.  \nRMIAN ensures that children are fully informed of their rights and options and, wherever \npossible, that they have expert legal representation to navigate the immigration legal \nsystem more efficiently and effectively. Without RMIAN, removal proceedings would take \nfar longer and the dockets would be clogged with cases that are not even under the court’s \njurisdiction while a child is pursuing legal status with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \nServices. Immigration judges and court staff regularly express gratitude for the ways in \nwhich RMIAN’s services assist the court.  \n11. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025. \n \n12. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied  children.  This  termination  was  effective  the  same  day,  March  21, \n2025.HHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers \n(CLINs): CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non- \nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows and Randstad placements who represent unaccompanied \nchildren  not  covered  under  CLIN  2;  and  CLIN  4,  Spanish  language  tutoring  for \norganizational staff who work with children. For the time being, HHS has left in place only \nCLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se \nchildren in  ORR facilities. Per the partial termination,  HHS ordered Acacia and  all \nsubcontractors  to  stop  work  immediately  on  CLINs  2,  3,  and  4.  HHS  provided  no \njustification for the partial termination other than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n13. RMIAN received news of both the stop work order and the notice of contract termination \nfrom the Acacia Center for Justice via email. RMIAN staff had to immediately pivot from \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 110\n\n(139 of 956), Page 139 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 139 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nproviding representation to children to informing all staff of the stop work order and \ncontract termination and planning for its impact on RMIAN’s services and funding. \n14. Funding from HHS for unaccompanied children’s legal services comprises approximately \n15%  of  RMIAN’s  total  annual budget and  26%  of  its  Children’s  Program  Budget—\napproximately  $772,000  this  year.  Because  there  are  currently  no  ORR  shelters  in \nColorado, RMIAN does not receive any funding for CLIN1 services to children in ORR \ncustody. Thus, the partial contract termination serves as a complete termination of all \nfunding for RMIAN’s work under the contract.  \n15. HHS funding currently allows RMIAN to employ approximately six full-time-equivalent \nstaff  positions, including  attorneys,  a  law  clerk,  coordinators,  a  paralegal  and  an \nadministrative assistant. It remains uncertain whether staff and client cases could be shifted \nto other funding sources. RMIAN would need to pull from its reserves and limited \nunrestricted funds to continue paying staff and providing representation to unaccompanied \nchildren. This would only be possible on a temporary basis until layoffs would need to be \nconsidered. \n When news of the stop work order broke, RMIAN received panicked calls from children, \ntheir caregivers, foster care providers, and case managers worried that the stop work order \nmeant  that  RMIAN  would  no  longer  provide  representation.  Similar  panic  ensued \nfollowing the news of the contract termination. Instead of focusing on preparing children’s \nlegal applications, RMIAN staff had to respond to countless calls and inquiries about how \nthe stop work order and contract termination would impact its child clients. While RMIAN \nhas  been  able  to  provide  temporary  reassurance  that  children  will  continue  to  be \nrepresented using RMIAN’s reserves and limited unrestricted funding, its staff will be \nunable to provide such assurances long-term.  \n17. RMIAN firmly believes that no child should be forced to navigate immigration legal \nproceedings alone, and that every child deserves to have an attorney to inform them of their \nrights and options and to represent them in any defenses they may qualify for under the \nlaw. In reliance on the government’s consistent funding, RMIAN has been steadily building \nits Children’s Program to be able to increase how many children it is able to serve each \nyear.  RMIAN  hopes  to  continue  expanding  programming  and  staffing  so  that  more \nunaccompanied children in Colorado have access to expert legal representation. However, \nwithout HHS funding, not only will RMIAN not be able to provide representation to any \nadditional children, but the ability to provide continued representation to current child \nclients is also under threat.  \n18. RMIAN  has  relied  upon  the  government’s  consistent  funding  of  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied  children  in  building  its  Children’s  Program,  and  in  crafting  the \nrepresentational agreements RMIAN has executed with child clients. In reliance on the \ngovernment’s  consistent  funding  consistent  with  congressional  appropriations,  the \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 111\n\n(140 of 956), Page 140 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 140 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nTVPRA, the Foundational  Rule, and in accordance with  RMIAN’s subcontract  with \nAcacia, RMIAN’s representation agreements with most unaccompanied children include a \ncommitment to continue representation through obtaining asylum, U/T nonimmigrant \nstatus, or permanent residency, if they are eligible for this relief under U.S. law. For most \nof RMIAN’s clients, this means that it has promised to continue representation for several \nyears due to extreme delays and backlogs in processing and adjudications of these relief \napplications.  \n19. RMIAN has legally and ethically binding obligations to its clients to continue providing \nrepresentation despite this halt in funding. Ethical rules require attorneys to continue \nrepresentation to the conclusion of the matters undertaken on behalf of clients. Withdrawal \nmay only be permitted under ethical rules if withdrawal would not be materially adverse \nto the client’s case. Withdrawal from children’s cases would be materially adverse because \nthey cannot competently represent themselves in matters before the immigration court, the \nstate court, or before USCIS, they could not afford private counsel to represent them, and \nwithdrawal would more than likely lead to their cases being denied—resulting in their \nremoval.  \n20. RMIAN is committed to continuing to represent its child clients despite this termination of \nfunding. However, it will have to pull from limited reserves and unrestricted funding to do \nso, and may have to consider staff layoffs. Ultimately, if significant layoffs become \nnecessary, despite the significant detrimental impact on clients, RMIAN may need to \nconsider withdrawing from clients’ cases if it does not have sufficient staff to continue \nrepresentation.  \n21. RMIAN will have to dedicate its limited staff time to fundraising to try to raise the funds \nnecessary to continue providing representation, with no guarantee of success. This diverts \nlimited time and resources away from providing representation. It also diverts limited \nfunding for representation of other clients as well as funding that allows for staff leave and \nbenefits, staff wellness initiatives, and necessary organizational infrastructure. The stop \nwork order caused great distress among staff, but was short-lived. The termination of \nfunding has significantly impacted staff morale and caused staff stress and concern about \nwhether they will continue to have a job and be able to provide for themselves and their \nfamilies. Even if layoffs don’t become immediately necessary, this worry may cause staff \nto leave RMIAN for employment that is more securely funded. This would leave RMIAN \nshort-staffed and place more of the burden to continue representation on fewer staff, and \nwould increase the likelihood RMIAN would have to consider withdrawal from clients’ \ncases.  \n22.  Any interruption, reduction or termination in HHS funding significantly harms RMIAN \nand its mission to provide legal representation to unaccompanied children.  \n \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 112\n\n(141 of 956), Page 141 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 141 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-11     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n Executed on the 22nd day of March 2025, in Westminster, Colorado.       \n                \n_______________________________  \nAshley T.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My  name  is  Gautam  Jagannath,  and  I  am  the  Executive  Director  at  Social  Justice \nCollaborative (“SJC”).  We are based in Berkeley, California in the San Francisco Bay Area \nand have been provided full-scope deportation defense services for low-income noncitizens \nall over the nine Bay Area counties as well as the California central valley. SJC is one of \nthe primary organizations dedicated to providing legal services to indigent unaccompanied \nimmigrant children who are not in detention as well as those held in Office of Refugee \nResettlement (“ORR”) custody throughout Northern and Central California.  \n2.  Our organization teams are composed of administration, executive staff, attorneys, legal \nassistants, social workers and other individuals who work together in units to represent \nclients, ensure that their needs are met and that we continually prevail in court.  Because \nwe are a legal services organization, we operate like a law office and our teams depend on \nhaving lawyers and legal assistants work on all aspects of the case, from intake to work-up \nand preparation for trial. \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, SJC has several main work components, but relevant to \nthe instant litigation, we represent unaccompanied minors who are not in ORR custody in \nimmigration proceedings. We further host Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) fellows to \nrepresent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings.  Our programs at SJC are \nunique because we have always provided full-scope representation to vitally underserved \nminors as well as families, but we also provide access to wrap around services including \nsocial workers to help navigate challenges of newcomer life in the United States. \n4.  SJC has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in California \nsince 2012. Since our inception, we have always taken cases for any indigent immigrant in \nCalifornia, we represent thousands of families a year.  Our unaccompanied minor clients \nrepresent about a third of all we represent in immigration proceedings. Specifically, SJC \nserves a combined annual number of around over 400 unaccompanied children. Roughly \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 115\n\n(144 of 956), Page 144 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 144 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nfor at least the fiscal year 2024, our representative breakdown for these minors was 35% \nadjustment of status, 38% asylum proceedings, 25% special juvenile status.  The residue \nbalance is composed of U/T nonimmigrant relief, refugee petitions and other applications. \nNaturally, a lot of work authorizations are not included for all these children to get kids the \nbenefits,  both  entitlements  and  means  tested  that  they  deserve  in  California.    That \nrepresents over 200 applications just in FY 2024. \n5.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, SJC currently has \nhired three (3) staff members, all of whom are IJC fellows, dedicated to providing legal \nservices to unaccompanied immigrant children. Specifically, one is a California lawyer and \ntwo of the staff members are law graduates with pending bar admission results. \n6.  Staff providing representation to children regularly conduct client interviews, prepare \nclients for hearings, as well as provide legal education, individual consultations, and attend \ncourt hearings and other appointments for clients as well as their families. SJC represents \nchildren in all stage of removal proceedings in immigration court, BIA appeals, petitions \nfor  review  at  the  Ninth  Circuit,  affirmative  relief  like  asylum  before  USCIS,  SIJS \npredicates in state court. \n7.  In recent months, we have had several referrals come from youth-serving professionals \nwho are actively trying to find help for the children they work with. Even those who \nregularly refer to legal service providers are hitting roadblocks. Waitlists are closed. Pro \nbono and nonprofit providers are overwhelmed. Paying for legal services is out of reach \nfor the vast majority of adult immigrants let alone children who need to be in school. \n8.  We routinely place cases for that have made their way through the immigration system to \npro bono counsel at our firm partners through our legal clinics.  These legal clinics are held \nfrequently throughout the year and would be severely, albeit indirectly, affected by the loss \nof funding through this grant.  \n9.  In 2023, SJC’s new Special Immigrant Juvenile (“SIJ”) Task Force completed its first full \nyear. The task force was created in response to the growing demand for legal representation \nfor minors. This was based on an increased number of intakes and referrals. However, \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 116\n\n(145 of 956), Page 145 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 145 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nconversations with partners across various sectors made it clear this was not an isolated \nissue. It reflected broader, statewide, and national trends. \n10. SJC is one of the few organizations who works in areas considered legal deserts in \nCalifornia. In some of these regions, we are one of the only organizations offering any legal \nservices, including full-scope removal defense.  We do not merely fill forms for clients and \nwish them luck. Even in more populated counties where other providers exist, the demand \nstill far exceeds what’s available. \n11. A partner recently shared that a very young immigrant child believed that carrying a red \ncard—a know-your-rights resource widely distributed in immigrant communities—would \nprevent them from being detained if stopped. While red cards are an important tool for \nasserting one’s rights, this child was under the impression that the card functioned more \nlike a legal shield. It’s easy to understand how a young person, without legal guidance, \ncould draw that conclusion not knowing much more.  \n \n12. Stories like this make it painfully clear that general information, no matter how widely \nshared, is not a substitute for individualized legal support. Children need someone who \ncan walk them through their options and answer their questions.  That is where SJC often \ncomes in.  We have a team of legal professionals working up and prevailing on legal sta-\ntus, but we also are providing social workers to support our children.  \n13. We currently have clients who are not yet one year old. Even without considering trauma, \nlanguage barriers, or lack of resources, there is no path forward for a child that young \nwithout help. But of course, we do have to consider those things. Many of our clients are \nindigenous and do not speak Spanish, a language many assume they would speak. These \nminors often face not only trauma and language access issues but also deep cultural barriers \nand a long-standing experience with systems that overlook or ignore them. This makes it \nextremely difficult—if not impossible—for children to find legal representation, let alone \nsecure it in time to meet the deadlines in their cases. \n14. Immigration Judges (“IJ’s”) have over the past decade and more have expressed gratitude \nto SJC staff attorneys for the efficiency our providers bring to their dockets, which are often \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 117\n\n(146 of 956), Page 146 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 146 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nexpedited, and caseload management.  It is not uncommon for the EOIR based in San \nFrancisco, Concord and Sacramento to make referrals of minors to SJC’s intake team. \nMany IJs appreciate our work product because we are known for bringing cases fully \nprepared for trial, well developed, and often fully documented.  We have often been able \nto engage in stipulations with government counsel to avoid unnecessary continuances and \nappeals especially for minors. \n15. Our organization repeatedly earns praise from the California State Bar, as we are an IOLTA \nfunded legal service provider.  We are also regularly praised by the California Department \nof Social Services who has continuously renewed contractual awards with SJC since 2015. \nWe recently have been praised for maintained a shared vision centered on program \nassessment, we advance diversity and inclusion, we emphasize excellence, achieve goals, \nfoster communication, engage staff at all levels, and ensure proper training and resource \nmanagement. SJC exhibits a strong client-centered delivery system with programming \naligned to our vision and funding requirements. We also demonstrate cultural competence \nthrough understanding of diverse community needs and histories, effectively engage with \neligible  populations,  and  establish  appropriate  partnerships  with  government  and \ncommunity organizations. \n16. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on February 21, 2025. \n \n17. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 118\n\n(147 of 956), Page 147 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 147 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n18.  We learned of the contract cancellation through an email from a statement put out by Jojo \nAnnobil, the CEO of Immigrant Justice Corps. \n19. The terminated funding accounts for roughly 8% of our organization’s total budget.  SJC \nhad been funded to represent roughly 45 unaccompanied minors per year under CLIN 2. \nThe staff affected would be three IJC fellows.  If we had to lose this funding and there was \nno new funding to be secured, we would be forced to lay off these fellows ASAP because \nwe do not have operating budget to sustain their work.  We have not yet secured any \nadditional or new funding to secure these fellows.  \n20. The funding loss is a huge blow to our immigrant communities and morale of staff.  We \nhave been fortunate enough to survive almost a decade and a half without a single layoff \nand yet this could be our first.  \n21. For example, the SJC cases of Y, JS, and MHC represent particularly compelling scenarios \nfor continued IJC funding support. All three individuals are currently not in active removal \nproceedings. Each presents strong affirmative relief claims requiring immediate legal \nintervention—specifically through asylum and SIJS pathways—demonstrating clear harm \nif representation were terminated. Financial barriers are insurmountable for all three cases: \nY's family faces demonstrable poverty alone, JS as a dependent high school student has no \nincome  source,  and  MHC's  family  lacks  financial  means  for  private  representation. \nCritically, none of these clients have any alleged gang affiliations or criminal history. \nFurthermore,  each  client  has  been  released  to  documented  sponsors  with  lawful \nimmigration status—Y to a U.S. resident sponsor with a Social Security number, JS to a \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 119\n\n(148 of 956), Page 148 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 148 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-12     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nsponsor with asylum-based residency, and MHC to a sponsor with SIJS-based residency—\nall people with valid legal status. Without sustained IJC funding, these vulnerable youth \nwith  strong  relief  eligibility  would  face  the  complex  immigration  processes  without \ncounsel, dramatically reducing their likelihood of securing protection despite qualifying \nunder established legal criteria. \n22. In the face of these layoffs, we may be forced to try and refer out the clients such as the \nones described above who were previously represented by our IJC fellows. However,  we \nknow that all organizations doing this work are overly burdened and many cannot take new \ncases.  As noted above, all providers are overburdened.  Thus, it is highly unclear whether \nwe would be successful in referring out our affected clients.  \n23. If we are unsuccessful in referring these clients to other organizations, then we believe \nunder California law and relevant legal ethics that we would be forced to continue \nrepresentation of clients without ORR funding. This would lead to further depletion of \nlimited resources. This patently hurts staff morale, especially when our other staff are \nalready working at and above their full capacity. Trying to competently represent affected \nclients without sufficient funding will likely lead to burn-out and result in other staff \nresigning or leaving for other jobs, thereby further harming our organization and the clients.  \n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury under the Laws of the United States that the foregoing is true \nand correct.  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Berkeley, California, United States.     \n              \n_______________________________  \nGautam Jagannath, Esq. \nExecutive Director \nSOCIAL JUSTICE COLLABORATIVE \n1832 Second Street \nBerkeley, CA 94710 \n(p) 510.992.3964 \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 120\n\n(149 of 956), Page 149 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 149 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF LISA KOOP (NIJC) \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nIN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \n \nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY \nPlaintiffs, \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND \nv.

The Children’s Protection Project equips children to make \ninformed decisions about how to proceed with their immigration cases and represents \nchildren in applications for immigration benefits and in their removal proceedings before \nthe immigration courts.    \n \n3.  In order to carry out this mission, NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project has several main \nwork components: (1) Providing educational services in the form of legal education \n“Know Your Rights” (“KYR”) presentations and conducting individual consultations \nwith unrepresented children in ORR custody in Illinois and Indiana; (2) Representing \nunaccompanied minors who are not in ORR custody in immigration and related \nproceedings; and (3) Representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings. \nNIJC hosts Immigrant Justice Corps (IJC) fellows to represent unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren in removal proceedings and provides Spanish-language support for staff \nrepresenting unaccompanied children. \n \n4.  NIJC has provided legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children since its \ninception more than 40 years ago. More than 15 years ago, NIJC began receiving funding \nfrom the federal government to provide KYRs and legal consultations to children in ORR \ncustody. NIJC’s contract to serve immigrant children expanded several times to allow for \na broader range of services to a larger number of children. NIJC is funded by the federal \ngovernment to provide legal services, including KYRs, consultations, and representation \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 122\n\n(151 of 956), Page 151 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 151 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\nto children in ORR custody and children outside of ORR custody, who were previously \ndetained. The funds are administered by the Acacia Center for Justice.  \n \n5.  At present, NIJC serves children detained by the federal government in 11 facilities in \nIllinois and Indiana, which together have capacity for 431 children on any given day. \nNIJC serves a combined annual number of around 2,300 children. NIJC provides KYRs \nand legal screenings to around 1,800 children in ORR custody, initiates representation \nwith about 100 detained children, and maintains a caseload of around 500 children who \nare released from ORR custody and continue in their applications for relief and in \nremoval proceedings. \n \n6.  With United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, NIJC \nemploys about 42 staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied \nimmigrant children. Specifically, to do this work, NIJC employs one director partially on \nthis funding, one managing attorney fully on this funding, one program manager fully on \nthis funding, four legal supervisors fully on this funding, three legal supervisors partially \non this funding, nine staff attorneys fully on this funding, seven fellows fully on this \nfunding, one coordinator partially on this funding, 13 paralegals fully on this funding, and \ntwo paralegals partially on this funding.  \n \n7.  NIJC staff members providing KYR presentations, consultations, and representation to \nchildren in ORR facilities regularly travel to each facility to provide in-person legal \neducation, offer legal consultations, conduct client interviews, and prepare clients for \nhearings. NIJC visits each ORR facility once or twice each week. NIJC legal workers \nmeet with recently arrived children who need KYRs and legal screenings, meet with \nchildren who are seeking additional information about legal proceedings, and meet with \nchildren who are NIJC clients for client counseling and case preparation.   \n \n8.  NIJC represents children seeking various forms of immigration relief and protection from \ndeportation including asylum, special immigrant juvenile status, T-visas for survivors of \nhuman trafficking, temporary protected status, and family-based petitions. NIJC \nrepresents children before the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, the \nimmigration courts, the Board of Immigration Appeals, and state courts. Where \nappropriate, NIJC advocates for the release of children from ORR custody or for transfer \nbetween ORR programs. If NIJC’s clients are transferred to adult detention and held by \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), NIJC may represent clients in bond \nhearings and in seeking relief from removal while in ICE detention.  \n \n9.  NIJC’s next scheduled court hearing for an unaccompanied child client is on April 2, \n2025. NIJC has at least eight immigration court hearings and two state court hearings for \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 123\n\n(152 of 956), Page 152 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 152 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nchild clients in April. While NIJC expects to attend the hearings in April, NIJC’s ability \nto do so in May and beyond is in jeopardy because of the contract termination and the \ncancellation of funding to serve this population.  \n \n10. Children served by NIJC in ORR custody are particularly vulnerable. Many experienced \npersecution by the governments in their home countries or by agents their governments \nare unwilling or unable to control. Many children experienced abandonment, abuse, and \nneglect by one or both of their parents. Some children served by NIJC are survivors of \nhuman trafficking. NIJC frequently serves children considered to be of tender age, \nbecause they are younger than 13 years old. NIJC serves many children who speak rare \nlanguages, meaning not Spanish or English. NIJC staff members are trained to provide \nlegal education and legal services through interpreters to reach these children.  \n \n11. Without NIJC services, it is highly unlikely children in ORR custody in NIJC’s service \narea will receive legal services. Most children served by NIJC are indigent and cannot \npay private attorneys to represent them. Pro bono resources for children in ORR custody \nare scant. Children who are unable to pay a private attorney or connect with a nonprofit \norganization like NIJC face deportation proceedings on their own, without an attorney. \nFor most children, the task of presenting a claim for relief from removal on their own is \ninsurmountable and they are denied the opportunity to present their cases, are denied due \nprocess, and are likely to be ordered deported.  \n \n12. For example, NIJC representation is critical to clients like eight-year-old Juan,1 who is an \nindigent immigrant child who was released from ORR custody into the care of his United \nStates citizen mother. Juan is not in removal proceedings and has no negative factors in \nhis case. Juan was abandoned by his father and requires attorney representation to \nestablish eligibility for family-based protection through his mother.   \n \n13. NIJC’s work with immigrant children is increasingly critical because in recent weeks, \nICE has increased the rate and speed with which it serves Notices to Appear (NTAs) on \nimmigrant children. Service of the NTA and the filing of the NTA with the immigration \ncourt causes removal proceedings against children to proceed. Under this practice, \nchildren have reduced time to have their cases screened by NIJC, receive case \nassessments, make decisions about how they wish to proceed, file procedural motions to \nposition their cases to proceed before the court, prepare applications for relief, gather \nevidence, and develop legal arguments in support of their claims for relief from removal. \nWithout access to NIJC’s legal services—an inevitable reality given the loss of funding to \ndo this work—children with filed NTAs will be greatly disadvantaged.  \n \n1 NIJC is using a substitute name to project client confidentiality.  \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 124\n\n(153 of 956), Page 153 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 153 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\n \n14. In the event that NIJC is forced to cease representing existing clients, the children NIJC \ncurrently serves will be highly unlikely to find private attorneys or pro bono counsel to \nrepresent them. In NIJC’s experience, pro bono attorneys are usually not willing to accept \nmatters involving immigrant children without training and ongoing support from an \norganization with immigration law expertise, like NIJC.      \n \n15. NIJC’s work on behalf of immigrant children is welcomed by immigration judges. NIJC \nmaintains a strong working relationship with ICE attorneys as well as ORR officials. In \nrecent weeks, as the sustainability of NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project has been \nthreatened, a judge at the Chicago Immigration Court expressed concern that NIJC might \nnot be available to represent children appearing before her court. Judges have stated to \nNIJC attorneys that their representation of children allows the court to proceed in an \nefficient manner; it allows judges to be assured that the children have been screened for \nrelief, counseled about their options, and equipped to make informed decisions as they \nface removal proceedings. Likewise, local shelter providers rely on NIJC to provide \ntimely KYR services to the children in their care and value NIJC’s expertise and \nknowledge in working with unaccompanied children. \n \n16. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the United States Department of \nthe Interior) issued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for \nUnaccompanied Children, effective immediately, which extended to all of our Contract \nLine Numbers (CLINs): 1. KYR presentations and legal services for pro se children in \nORR facilities; 2. Legal representation for unaccompanied children both in ORR custody \nand released from ORR custody, as well as additional tasks to support and report on the \nprovision of legal services; 3. Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent children \nnot covered under other CLINs; and 4. Spanish language interpretation and training for \norganizational staff who work with children. Without elaboration on duration or \nreasoning, the stop work order stated that it would “remain in place until you are notified \notherwise” and was “being implemented due to causes outside of your control and should \nnot be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \n \n17. NIJC received notice of the stop work order from the Acacia Center for Justice. NIJC \npromptly informed staff members on the Children’s Protection Project, who were greatly \ndistressed by the news that NIJC’s ability to serve immigrant children had been \ndramatically compromised. The stop work order remained in force for about three days, \nbut the program was briefly reinstated and the stop-work order lifted on the third day.  \n \n18. Then, on March 21, 2025, also without warning, NIJC learned that HHS (through the \nUnited States Department of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 125\n\n(154 of 956), Page 154 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 154 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nAcacia Center for Justice (to which NIJC is a subcontractor) that funds legal services for \nunaccompanied children. This termination took effect the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 CLINs: CLIN 2, Legal \nrepresentation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-representation services, \nsuch as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows \nwho represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish \nlanguage support for organizational staff who work with children.  \n \n19. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no explanation for the partial termination other than \n“the Government’s convenience.” \n \n20. NIJC received notice of the partial termination from the Acacia Center for Justice. NIJC \npromptly informed staff members on the Children’s Protection Project, who were again \ngreatly distressed by the news that NIJC’s ability to serve immigrant children had been \ndramatically compromised after having previously endured the stop work order. \n \n21. The funding NIJC receives from the federal government to serve immigrant children \namounts to more than four million dollars and comprises more than 25% of NIJC’s \noverall budget. Without this funding, NIJC cannot maintain its staff and will be forced to \nterminate positions. To the extent NIJC is able to transition some staff members from the \nChildren’s Protection Project to other projects at NIJC, NIJC may be able to preserve \nsome jobs, but the funding sources for other projects would require people to shift the \nscope of their work. Other funding streams do not allow for the scope and volume of \nservices NIJC currently provides to immigrant children. Put simply: without this funding, \nchildren in NIJC’s service area will lose their attorneys, will be unable to seek protection \nlike asylum, will be more vulnerable to human trafficking, and will face deportation to \nplaces where they will be harmed.  \n \n22. Even in the limited circumstances where it is possible, shifting staff members from \nNIJC’s Children’s Protection Project to other NIJC projects carries significant costs for \nNIJC. NIJC will lose the ability to fully use the expertise of Children’s Protection Project \nstaff members as some of those staff members are incorporated into other teams and the \nfocus of their work is broadened.  \n \n23. In light of the partial contract termination and ongoing risk to funding for legal services \nfor immigrant children, NIJC has initiated transfers of about five staff members to other \nNIJC projects. NIJC has not re-hired for positions vacated by Children’s Protection \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 126\n\n(155 of 956), Page 155 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 155 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-13     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\nProject staff members who left NIJC. These adjustments have already compromised the \nability of NIJC to serve immigrant children. NIJC is also undertaking an assessment of \nvacancies in other NIJC teams and likely departures in the coming months to identify \nother ways to keep at least some members of the Children’s Protection Project employed. \nThe Children’s Protection Project has conducted significant restructuring and \nreassignment of cases and other responsibilities to account for these shifts. NIJC’s senior \nmanagement team, including NIJC’s executive director, chief operating officer, director \nof development, and director of legal services, have devoted significant time to \nresponding to the Children’s Protection Project funding crisis. Responding to this \nsituation has prevented NIJC from conducting other work critical to NIJC’s mission.  \n \n24. NIJC’s Children’s Protection Project is a core part of NIJC’s mission and an integral \ncomponent of NIJC’s comprehensive work to protect the rights of immigrants, refugees, \nand asylum seekers. A significant reduction in NIJC’s ability to represent children, as will \noccur if federal funding is not restored, will undermine the mission of NIJC, will deny \nimmigrant children a fair day in court, and compromise decades of work NIJC has \naccomplished for immigrant children.       \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Goshen, Indiana.           \n            \ns/ Lisa Koop                      .  \nLisa Koop, National Director of Legal Services  \nNational Immigrant Justice Center  \n110 E.

I \ncertify under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  My name is Laura Nally, and I am the Program Director overseeing the Children’s Program \nat Amica Center for Immigrant Rights (“Amica Center”), formerly known as the Capital \nArea Immigrants’ Rights (“CAIR”) Coalition. Amica Center is a Washington, D.C.-based \nnonprofit legal services organization that strives to ensure equal justice for all indigent \nimmigrant  men,  women,  and  children  at  risk  of  detention  and  deportation  in  the \nWashington,  D.C.  area  and  beyond,  through  providing  pro  bono  legal  services  and \nrepresentation. I am an attorney licensed in Virginia and the District of Columbia and have \nbeen practicing immigration law for more than 15 years. I joined the Children’s Program \nat Amica Center in August 2019.  \n2.  Amica Center operates three main programs: the Detained Adult Program (“DAP”), the \nChildren’s Program (“DUCs” or the “Children’s Program”), and the Immigration Impact \nLab. DUCs’ work specifically focuses on offering legal services and representation to \nunaccompanied immigrant children held by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) \nat ORR-subcontracted facilities, including shelter and foster care programs, as well as \nchildren in ORR Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (“ORR URM”) programs in the greater \nWashington, D.C. and Baltimore areas.  \n3.\n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 138\n\n(167 of 956), Page 167 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 167 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 17\n4.  To provide these services, Amica Center’s Children’s Program now has 33 full-time and 4 \npart-time staff members. Specifically, the Children’s Program employs a program director, \ndeputy program director, three managing attorneys, one supervising attorney, five senior \nattorneys, six staff attorneys, one Immigrant Justice Corps (“IJC”) Attorney Fellow, two \ncontract attorneys, two managing paralegals, four senior paralegals, seven paralegals, one \nsenior program associate, and three social services staff members. Several additional \npositions are currently vacant due to challenges hiring qualified attorneys in a climate of \nfunding uncertainty. We rely on funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (“HHS”), distributed to us through the Acacia Center for Justice as sub-contractor, \nto fund over 96% of our program. \n5.  Children’s Program staff work to provide legal support, direct representation, and social \nservices to unaccompanied immigrant children who are currently or have been released \nfrom ORR custody at juvenile facilities in Washington, D.C., Virginia, and Maryland. Our \ngoals are to educate children about their rights and their legal options while in ORR \ncustody, ensure that their needs are being met and their rights respected, and to represent \nchildren in pursuing any immigration relief or applications for which they may be eligible. \n6.  This work has two principal work components: (1) providing legally-required “Know Your \nRights” presentations to children held in ORR-subcontracted facilities; conducting age-\nappropriate  and  trauma-informed  one-on-one  legal  screenings  for  eligibility  for \nimmigration relief; referring children reunified outside of our geozone to other legal service \nproviders; and preparing and accompanying all detained unaccompanied children in our \ngeozone to their court appearances; and (2) providing in-house direct legal representation \nto unaccompanied children in immigration court, before federal agencies, and in state court \nto pursue immigration relief and applications, as well as referring cases to and mentoring \npro-bono attorneys.  \n7.  To deliver KYR, legal screening, and other non-representational services, Amica Center \nstaff travel in person to each ORR-subcontracted facility on a weekly basis. In calendar \nyear 2024, we provided “Know Your Rights” trainings and intakes to nearly 1,600 children \nin more than 20 languages. In 2023, our team developed a specialized KYR presentation \nusing cartoon animals to provide age-appropriate services to tender age (under 12) children. \nAmica Center utilizes a weekly visit model to ensure that all children receive these initial \nservices within 10 days of their arrival in ORR custody. Depending on the children’s \nlanguage needs, multiple Know Your Rights presentations may be provided on any given \nday. Most children do not understand why they are being held in government custody, that \nthey will be placed in removal proceedings, or that legal protections exist for children under \nU.S. immigration law. Our staff are trained not only to break down complex information \nand topics in  age- and culturally-appropriate ways, but to utilize active engagement \nstrategies to ensure that children are fully engaged and focused on the material and able to \nask questions. Children then immediately receive a legal screening with a staff member \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 139\n\n(168 of 956), Page 168 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 168 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 17\ntrained in trauma-informed and child-friendly interviewing. It is not uncommon for a legal \nscreening to take place over multiple meetings if a child is too emotionally overwhelmed \nto tell their story or needs time to build trust before recounting traumatic events.  \n8.  The Children’s Program also provides a crucial suite of nonrepresentational services \nincluding court preparation, courtroom assistance and accompaniment, and legal referrals. \nWhen  a  child  in  an  ORR-subcontracted  facility  is  scheduled  for  an  appearance  in \nimmigration court, we meet individually with the child to explain what to expect in court \nand then appear alongside the child as “Friend of the Court” to share information and \nupdates with the immigration court such as the child’s expected reunification location. We \nalso help children with matters related to their placement and rights within the ORR system. \nWhen a child is expected to remain in ORR custody until their 18th birthday, we have \nassisted the ORR-subcontracted facility staff to identify suitable post-18 placements such \nas transitional housing programs for young adults and liaised with the Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (“ICE”) Field Office Juvenile Coordinator to advocate for the \nchild’s release to a community-based program rather than transfer to ICE detention. When \nwe identify a child to be a potential victim of trafficking, we refer them to the Office on \nTrafficking in Persons (“OTIP”) for a determination of eligibility for benefits and services \nunder federal law.  \n9.  Amica Center staff offer full legal representation to children in the ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities we serve who do not have a viable ORR sponsor, who are placed into an LTFC \nprogram, who wish to return to their home countries, whose immigration proceedings \nadvance to a point where they are expected to make substantive decisions about their legal \ncase, and who are confirmed to be reunifying into our geozone to ensure continuity of legal \nservices. We also initiate representation for particularly vulnerable children, including \nvictims of trafficking, children who have experienced abuse or neglect in custody, or \nchildren who have been placed in restrictive settings or out-of-network placements.  \n10.  Between March 30, 2024, and March 20, 2025, we initiated representation with 192 \nchildren in ORR-subcontracted facilities and ORR URM programs. Children’s Program \nattorneys represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings before the Hyattsville, \nBaltimore, Annandale, and Sterling Immigration Courts and the Board of Immigration \nAppeals (“BIA”). DUCs staff also represent children in applications with U.S. Citizen and \nImmigration Services (“USCIS”) including asylum, Special Immigrant Juvenile Status \n(“SIJS”), family-based and humanitarian (U and T) visas, Temporary Protected Status \n(“TPS”) and self-petitions under the Violence Against Women Act (“VAWA”). In addition \nto providing direct legal services, Amica Center staff also work to recruit, train, and \nsupervise  teams  of  pro  bono  attorneys  who  represent  unaccompanied  children  in \nimmigration proceedings and applications for immigration status. These pro bono attorneys \nare a critical part of Amica Center’s mission and model which allows us to leverage \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 140\n\n(169 of 956), Page 169 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 169 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 17\nvolunteer legal services to more efficiently represent children. Approximately 15% of cases \ncurrently open with the Children’s Program are placed with pro bono attorneys. \n11.  Amica Center’s Children’s Program has continuously received HHS funding since 2015. \nWe currently have more than 850 open cases that were initiated and continuously funded \nthrough HHS funding. Children released to sponsors or transitional living programs live \nthroughout the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas, including in the \nsuburbs of Virginia and Maryland. Specific bar licensure is required to represent children \nin SIJS cases in each of the three jurisdictions where we practice, and this affects how case \nassignments are made among our attorneys. Due to the significant backlogs in state courts, \nUSCIS, and the immigration courts, children’s immigration cases often take years to \nresolve before an eligible child is granted asylum, a U or T visa, or lawful permanent \nresidence.  \n12.  The need for legal representation and other support services for unaccompanied children—\nespecially those in government custody and those facing deportation—is truly critical. \nImmigration law and procedures are incredibly complex and becoming more so every day. \nThe  overwhelming  majority  of  unaccompanied  children  that  we  encounter  in  ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities do not have the means to pay for a qualified private immigration \nattorney to represent them. ORR-subcontracted facilities are often located in rural areas \nwhere  there  are  limited  or  no  pro  bono  resources.  For  example,  one  of  the  ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities that we serve is located approximately two hours away from \nWashington, D.C., the closest metropolitan area, by car and far from any other potential \nservice providers. \n13.\n14.  In our experience, other government stakeholders including immigration judges, ORR-\nsubcontracted facility staff, and the DHS Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”) \nattorneys also prefer and appreciate when an unaccompanied child is represented by \ncounsel. We frequently appear as Friend of Court to relay important updates regarding a \nchild’s reunification to OPLA and the immigration court and to coordinate appropriate \nchanges of address and changes of venue. ORR-subcontracted facility staff often have \nquestions for us about the logistics for children’s appearances in court. Immigration judges \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 141\n\n(170 of 956), Page 170 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 170 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 17\nhave sometimes requested that we enter appearances for children if the judge has doubts \nabout the child’s competency or understanding of their legal options. We also play a critical \nrole in identifying and referring children for appointment of a Child Advocate. For children \nwho are reunifying outside of our geozone, we provide legal referrals, either directly to \nanother Acacia Center network provider or by providing a list of potential pro bono or low-\ncost resources directly to the child and sponsor. Because capacity for free and low-cost \nrepresentation is overstretched in most areas, however, these resources can be very difficult \nto access. \n15.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a Stop Work Order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, effective \nimmediately,  which  extended  to  “all  activities”  under  the  contract. Attached  hereto \nas Exhibit 1 is a true and correct copy of the Stop Work Order, dated February 18, 2025. \nWithout further elaboration as to duration or reasoning, the Stop Work Order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” Ex. 1 at 1. HHS then rescinded the Stop Work Order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a true and correct copy of the Stop Work \nOrder Recission, dated February 21, 2025. \n16.  The chilling effect of the February Stop Work Order has had lasting effects on the \nChildren’s Program. Two staff members, including one Senior Paralegal and one IJC \nAttorney Fellow, have accepted employment with private immigration firms and cited as \nthe deciding factor the job insecurity generated by doubts about the security of our HHS \nfunding. This climate of uncertainty has also had a chilling effect on hiring qualified \nattorney candidates to fill existing vacancies, which in turn increases the caseloads of \nexisting staff and has a negative effect on morale and retention.  \n17.\n18.  Our program was notified of the Partial Termination via an email from the Acacia Center \nfor Justice shortly after 11 AM on March 21. We called a teamwide meeting several minutes \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 142\n\n(171 of 956), Page 171 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 171 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 17\nlater to share the news with staff and answer their questions. Although our staff are \nunderstandably  concerned  about  their  job  security  and  their  ability  to  obtain  future \nemployment due to the sweeping expanse of the cuts to funded legal representation for \nchildren, their overwhelming response was to look for solutions for how to continue to \nrepresent the clients who trust and rely on us for their legal cases.  \n19.  The abrupt termination of CLIN 2 funding for representation and associated services \nrepresents a loss of approximately 30% of Amica Center’s total annual budget and 75% of \nthe budget for the Children’s Program. Amica Center has not yet set a timeline by which \ndecisions would need to be made regarding staff layoffs or the discontinuation of any major \naspects of our work. However, all work on cases where representation was undertaken \nduring the preceding 10 years of HHS funding through the Acacia Center for Justice is now \nbeing funded using general operating funds. The organization has taken this position due \nto our ongoing ethical obligations to our clients and to preserve our ability to continue \nproviding high-quality representation to those clients by minimizing the loss of qualified \nstaff  members. Amica  Center  cannot  continue  to  fund  this  casework  using  general \noperating funds indefinitely. We are urgently seeking funding from other sources, but the \ncollective impact of a nationwide shutdown is so great that the gap cannot be filled by \nprivate donors. To the extent that cases initiated under HHS funding could be transferred \nto funding streams held by other Amica Center programs (for example, state or local \nfunding currently being used for adult representation), this would interfere with Amica \nCenter’s mission to maximize representation for indigent immigration men, women, and \nchildren at risk for detention and deportation by directly supplanting the organization’s \nability to represent other affected individuals. \n20.  The alternative—to immediately withdraw from representation in our 850 affected cases—\nis antithetical to our ethical obligations as attorneys and our values as a mission-driven \norganization. In many of the open legal cases for our child clients, there are upcoming \nhearings or deadlines which mean that withdrawing from the case would not be possible. \nAcross the Children’s Program, we have six clients scheduled for hearings with local \nimmigration courts between March 24 and March 27. Not only is it nearly logistically \nimpossible to withdraw from an immigration matter in that time frame, since withdrawal \nrequires leave of the immigration judge, it is also impossible to do so without prejudicing \nthe client’s legal interests. We have dozens of open matters pending with state courts for \nchildren who are eligible for SIJS. In addition to upcoming hearings, there are ongoing \ntime-sensitive legal requirements in those cases, including service of process on opposing \nparties, requests for orders of default, and other procedural requirements that, if not timely \ncompleted, could lead to dismissal or significant delay. Pro bono attorneys are heavily \nreliant on mentorship from experienced in-house immigration attorneys and at risk of \ncommitting errors or omissions in their cases without mentorship.  \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 143\n\n(172 of 956), Page 172 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 172 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 17\n21.  Although KYR presentations and legal screenings remain funded for now through CLIN \n1, significant, interrelated pieces of our work have been terminated, the consequences of \nwhich are immediate and severe. For example, if a child at one of the ORR-subcontracted \nfacilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal need such as an outstanding \nremoval  order,  Amica  Center—the  only  legal  provider  with  access  to  the  ORR-\nsubcontracted facility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to \nprotect the child from imminent removal. Many children who enter ORR custody with prior \nremoval orders are eligible to have their immigration court proceedings reopened, but \ndoing so requires filing a motion as quickly as possible, something which children simply \ncannot do without the help of an experienced attorney. Similarly, without timely access to \ncompetent legal services, older children are at risk of losing access to protections based on \ntheir age. A 17-year-11-month-old child who has been severely abused by their parent(s), \nfor example, is eligible under federal law to petition for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status \nuntil age 21. In Virginia, however, the Juvenile and Domestic Relations (“JDR”) court, \nmust make the necessary findings of fact regarding eligibility, must obtain jurisdiction \nbefore the child turns 18. Without access to legal representation who can initiate the \nnecessary proceedings before the child’s 18th birthday, that child’s right and ability to seek \nprotection through SIJS is functionally eliminated.  \n22.  One of the children currently represented by the Children’s Program is a four-year-old boy \nfrom Haiti, referred to here as “Jean.” He is currently in an ORR URM program living with \nfoster parents in Virginia. Jean entered the United States shortly after he turned three years \nold and was placed in ORR custody. After it was determined that there were no viable \nsponsors for him in the United States, Jean was released from custody to an ORR URM \nprogram served by Amica Center. Amica Center coordinated with the HHS-funded legal \nprovider which had been working with him at his ORR placement to transfer his legal case \nand  substitute  counsel  on  all  of  his  pending  matters  to  avoid  an  interruption  in \nrepresentation. Jean has a TPS application pending, is eligible for SIJS and is in removal \nproceedings. SIJS findings for Jean would be made through his open foster care proceeding \nin Virginia, and he is scheduled for a hearing on April 2, 2025. His Amica Center attorney \nhas been working to prepare the necessary motion and proposed order in advance to ensure \nthat the matter can be heard at the upcoming hearing. Jean is also scheduled for a Master \nCalendar Hearing in early June at which it is obvious that he could neither engage with the \nproceeding nor provide relevant updates to the court regarding his other pending legal \nmatters to the court other than through counsel. \n23.  The  interruption  and  subsequent  termination  of  funding  for  representation  and \nnonrepresentational services to unaccompanied children has already frustrated Amica \nCenter’s mission and threatened the sustainability of our work. Providing a legal screening \nwithout the ability to refer a child for long-term representation, connect them to benefits \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 144\n\n(173 of 956), Page 173 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 173 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 9 of 17\nand  services  for  victims  of  trafficking,  or  prepare  and  accompany  them  to  court, \nfundamentally restricts the efficacy of that legal orientation and screening.  \n24.\n25.  If the Children’s Program were forced to lay off staff due to sudden and unexpected \ntermination of funding, it would be a drain on our organizational expertise in the delivery \nof legal representation and other services to the unaccompanied immigrant children held \nin ORR custody. The collective experience of our specialized staff would be nearly \nimpossible to recover and would hobble our ability to deliver high-quality services to \nunaccompanied children in ORR custody in the Capital region, even if funding were \nrestored to similar levels in the future. The level of investment required to hire and train \nnew staff, fellows, volunteers, or interns would divert significant director and manager time \nand resources from the continued provision of representation to existing clients and have a \nlasting impact on the morale and retention of supervisors and managers. My own time over \nthe past month has been overwhelmingly diverted from essential case supervision and legal \nguidance in a rapidly changing area of immigration practice, to responding to threats to our \nfunding and program stability.  \n26.  The continued funding of this work is critical to ensuring that children do not experience \nirreparable harm to their ability to access legal protections in the United States. Children \nwho have spent months and years building trust and rapport with an attorney or legal \nadvocate will be faced with the prospect of navigating a complicated and increasingly \nhostile legal system alone or urgently seeking out either the few remaining low-cost \nresources for representation in this space or the resources to pay for private counsel, \nreliving and recounting some of their most personal and traumatic experiences with a \nstranger.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25 of March 2025, in Alexandria, Virginia.  \n                          \n8 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 145\n\n(174 of 956), Page 174 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 174 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 10 of 17\n_______________________________  \nDirector, Detained Children’s Program  \nAmica Center for Immigrant Rights \n1025 Connecticut Ave. NW, Suite 701 \nWashington, D.C. 20036            \nP: (202) 916-8179 \nlaura@amicacenter.org \n \n9 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 146\n\n(175 of 956), Page 175 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 175 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 11 of 17\n \nExhibit \n1  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 147\n\n(176 of 956), Page 176 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 176 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 12 of 17\nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 148\n\n(177 of 956), Page 177 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 177 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 13 of 17\n \nExhibit \n2  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 149\n\n(178 of 956), Page 178 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 178 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 14 of 17\n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 150\n\n(179 of 956), Page 179 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 179 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 15 of 17\n \nExhibit \n3  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 151\n\n(180 of 956), Page 180 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 180 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-15     Filed 03/27/25     Page 16 of 17\n   \nUnited States Department of the Interior \nINTERIOR BUSINESS CENTER \nWashington, DC 20240   \n \n \n \n \nMarch 25, 2025 \n \nTo:    \n    Acacia Center for Justice \n1025 Connecticut Avenue NW \nSuite 1000A \nWashington, DC 20036 \n \nSubject:   Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience \n \nContract 140D0422C0009, awarded on March 29, 2022, by the United States Department of the \nInterior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families \n(ACF), Office Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as a part of our Interagency Agreement for acquisition \nservices, is hereby partially terminated for the Government’s convenience.

I have been an \nimmigration attorney with CLSEPA for five and a half years, since September 2019. \nCLSEPA is a non-profit legal aid organization that serves residents of San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California. CLSEPA has offices in the city of East Palo Alto, San \nFrancisco, and Mountain View. CLSEPA is one of the primary organizations dedicated to \nproviding free immigration legal services to low-income immigrants in San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California, including indigent unaccompanied immigrant children \nwho are residing with sponsors in the San Francisco Bay Area after their release from \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody.  \n2.  CLSEPA is a legal aid organization with immigration, housing, and economic advancement \nlegal services. Our economic advancement work includes post-conviction relief, re-entry \nwork, workers’ rights, and consumer protection law. CLSEPA’s mission is to deliver \ntransformative legal services, empower communities, and help community members in \nEast Palo Alto, San Mateo County, and Santa Clara County achieve a secure and thriving \nfuture.  CLSEPA’s  immigration  practice  is  unique  among  immigration  legal  service \norganizations in that we handle both adult and children’s cases, as well as both defensive \ncases in deportation proceedings before the immigration court, and affirmative applications \nfor humanitarian or family-based visas from the immigration benefits agency, United States \nCitizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”). CLSEPA tries to prioritize vulnerable \nclients for immigration representation, as well as clients who would be unable to afford \nlegal representation elsewhere. \n3.  In order to carry out its mission, CLSEPA represents unaccompanied minors in removal \nproceedings in immigration court after they are released from ORR custody to sponsors \nliving in the Greater San Francisco Bay Area. As a major part of this work, we represent \nunaccompanied immigrant children who are in foster care and who are receiving social \nwork  services  from  another  organization,  Catholic  Charities  of  Santa  Clara  County \n(“CCSCC”).

CLSEPA has been providing legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children in \nCalifornia since 2014. CLSEPA began assisting unaccompanied immigrant children in \nremoval proceedings as part of Bay Area removal defense collaboratives and expanded our \nwork to include removal defense for immigrant children immediately following their \nrelease from ORR detention. CLSEPA currently represents about 50 children who are either \nin removal proceedings, or who we previously represented in removal proceedings. We \ncontinue to assist with affirmative applications for immigration status even after the \nconclusion of a child’s case in immigration court. Of these children, 23 are living in foster \ncare and were referred to CLSEPA for representation in their removal proceedings once \nthey were released from ORR detention into the custody of legal guardians. Most of our \nunaccompanied child clients are either based in Santa Clara or have ties there, either \nbecause they reside with their legal guardians in Santa Clara County, or their case workers \nare located there through CCSCC. \n5.  With U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, CLSEPA employs \nsix staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren. For all six staff members, representation of unaccompanied children makes up a \nsignificant portion of their case work. Specifically, three attorneys work on unaccompanied \nminors’  removal  defense  cases  in  immigration  court  and  each  represent  five  to  ten \nimmigrant children who were released from ORR custody into foster care. Three non-\nattorney paralegals assist CLSEPA’s immigration attorneys in the representation of our \nyouth and child clients. \n6.  CLSEPA’s work with unaccompanied minors only extends to legal representation after the \nchild’s release from ORR custody. We represent children in ongoing immigration cases in \nnon-detained  immigration  court,  or  in  applications  before  USCIS.  Staff  providing \nrepresentation to unaccompanied minors make every effort we can to meet with our clients \nin person and provide culturally appropriate and child-sensitive services. Staff travel to \ndifferent parts of the Greater San Francisco Bay Area to meet with clients, and work in \ncollaboration with clients’ guardians and social workers to conduct appointments and \nprepare applications for immigration benefits. CLSEPA represents children in removal \nproceedings in immigration court, affirmative relief like asylum before USCIS, Special \nImmigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”) in state court, and humanitarian visas like the T visa, \nU visa, or VAWA. \n7.  CLSEPA has represented 25 children through HHS’s Legal Services for Unaccompanied \nChildren  program  since  2022.  These  25  children  all  came  to  the  United  States  as \nunaccompanied immigrant children, and the majority live in foster care. Two of CLSEPA’s \nclients whom we served through HHS funding were children from Afghanistan who were \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 156\n\n(185 of 956), Page 185 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 185 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 6\ngranted  asylum  before  USCIS  and  have  already  been  granted  permanent  residency. \nCLSEPA remains the attorney of record for the remaining 23 of our child immigrant clients \nwhom we retained through HHS funding. \n8.  In our representation of unaccompanied minors in immigration court, CLSEPA has had a \npositive interaction with immigration judges and has been successful in negotiating with \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) to dismiss or terminate many clients’ \nremoval proceedings. CLSEPA is proactive about filing applications for immigration status \nas soon as possible and contacts opposing counsel from ICE in advance of all clients’ \nscheduled hearings in immigration court to ensure that clients can move forward with their \nimmigration cases without needing to miss school or appear in person at their hearings. Of \nthe 25 children who CLSEPA has represented in their immigration cases under the HHS \nUnaccompanied Children Program, none are currently in active removal proceedings. All \nclients’ removal defense cases have either been terminated, dismissed, were never filed \nwith the immigration court, or are administratively closed while awaiting a decision from \nUSCIS on an application for immigration benefits. \n9.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all four Contract Line Numbers (“CLINs”). \nWithout further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it \n“shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to \ncauses outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor \nperformance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. \n \n10. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, we learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS  terminated  the  contract  with  respect  to  3  of  the  4  Contract  Line  Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation services, such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds attorneys \nplaced through the Attorney Recruitment Project and Immigrant Justice Corps fellows who \nrepresent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish \nlanguage tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. For the time being, HHS \nhas left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal \nconsultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per the partial termination, HHS ordered \nAcacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS \nprovided  no  justification  for  the  partial  termination  other  than  “the  Government’s \nconvenience.”  \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 157\n\n(186 of 956), Page 186 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 186 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 6\n11. CLSEPA found out about the termination of the HHS contract for unaccompanied children \non the morning of Friday, March 21, through an email from the Acacia Center for Justice. \nOur staff was already working on our clients’ cases as usual and received receipt notices \nfor some of our HHS-funded clients’ immigration cases in the mail that same day. CLSEPA \ncontinued to advise and update our child clients about their cases, as required by our ethical \nobligations as attorneys and pursuant to the California Rules of Professional Responsibility.  \n12. If our HHS funding to represent unaccompanied minors in their immigration cases is \nterminated for good, CLSEPA will need to find another source of funding to continue \nrepresenting our clients. CLSEPA intends to continue representing our clients in their \naffirmative immigration applications with USCIS and in their administratively closed \nremoval proceedings in removal court. We will follow through on our commitment to re-\ncalendar and terminate clients’ administratively closed removal proceedings when they are \neligible and will continue to renew the employment authorization for clients who have \npending asylum applications or approved SIJS status. For our clients who have SIJS status \nand are in the visa backlog with their applications for permanent residency, CLSEPA \nunfortunately may need to re-evaluate our signed contracts to determine whether we can \nstill guarantee representation once their priority date becomes current to adjust their status. \nAll 23 of our current child clients have approved SIJS status and are waiting for their \nopportunity to apply for permanent residency, but CLSEPA may no longer be able to assist \nthem without continued funding. \n13. CLSEPA’s funding from HHS to represent unaccompanied children in their immigration \ncases is one of our primary sources of funding for our immigration work. It currently \ncomprises about 15% of our immigration direct services budget. The three attorneys and \nthree support staff who work on this grant will need to do additional work to evaluate the \nnext steps on our children’s cases and determine whether we can continue to meet our \nobligations in their cases. CLSEPA will not be able to hire or train new staff as anticipated \nin order to continue this important work. CLSEPA may be able to assign our cases to other \nlocal, county, or state grants but this will vary depending on each child’s current location \nand case circumstances. Even if we are able to reassign our cases to other grants, it will \ncreate a burden on our staff and will mean that we are unable to take on new clients using \nthose already assigned funds. \n14. The contract termination creates a serious impact on CLSEPA’s mission and our ability to \nfulfill our ethical obligations to our clients. Unaccompanied immigrant children represent \nsome of our most vulnerable clients, especially those living in foster care. Most of these \nclients have approved SIJS status but need ongoing advice and renewals of immigration \nbenefits in order to maintain stability and participate in civic life in the United States. For \nclients in administratively closed removal proceedings, the process of substituting or \nwithdrawing counsel may prejudice the client or cause them to be placed back into active \nremoval  proceedings.  CLSEPA  intends  to  keep  representing  our  clients  in  removal \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 158\n\n(187 of 956), Page 187 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 187 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-16     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 6\nproceedings pursuant to our ethical obligations so that they are not harmed by a change in \ntheir  counsel.  However,  CLSEPA  has  had  grim  conversations  with  our  partner \norganizations to let them know that we may no longer be able to continue accepting \nreferrals for new cases. In particular, we have had to inform CCSCC that we can no longer \nguarantee representation for unaccompanied immigrant children who are placed into foster \ncare after release from ORR custody, even if they are in removal proceedings and have no \ncounsel to appear with them in court. Thus, the negative effects of the partial contract \ntermination are being felt beyond CLSEPA and affect the wider community’s ability to \nprovide services to unaccompanied children in San Mateo County, Santa Clara County, and \nthe Greater Bay Area.  \n15. The uncertainty around HHS funding and contract termination has also had a negative \nimpact on CLSEPA’s ability to hire and train new staff. This has in turn aggravated staff \nburnout. This burnout and overburdening of our remaining staff will continue to have a \nnegative impact over time if CLSEPA is unable to bring new attorneys into the team after \nstaff turnover.  While CLSEPA seeks new funding so we can represent our clients into the \nfuture, the reality that we may need to withdraw from some cases in the future causes a \nmoral injury to our staff who are dedicated to our clients and their wellbeing. The prospect \nof withdrawing from our clients’ cases is contrary to the sense of trust and safety that we \ntry to instill in our work, especially with our child clients. Furthermore, if our clients lose \ntheir immigration legal advocates, they will be at risk of having their legal status expire or \nof losing the opportunity to apply for permanent residency when they are eligible. Youth \nclients may also fall victim to immigration enforcement or be referred back to removal \nproceedings without ongoing advice from a legal advocate. The termination of this funding \nfor CLSEPA’s most vulnerable clients during a time when immigration enforcement has \nbecome more commonplace and more likely to violate clients’ constitutional rights is a \ndevastating loss for CLSEPA, for our staff, and for the communities we fight for so that \nthey can survive, thrive, and contribute to life here in the United States. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in San Francisco, California         \n              \n_______________________________  \nMartha Ruch \nLead Managing Attorney \nCLSEPA \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 159\n\n(188 of 956), Page 188 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 188 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 8\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF ELIZABETH \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nSANCHEZ KENNEDY (GHIRP) IN \n \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1. My name is Elizabeth Sanchez Kennedy, and I am the Executive Director at the Galveston-\nHouston Immigrant Representation Project. GHIRP is a legal services organization that\nwas launched in October 2020 with a mission to build a resilient, diverse community by\nproviding comprehensive representation and holistic legal services to immigrants in need.\nGHIRP’s legal services range from outreach and education to complex litigation in the\nGalveston-Houston  area.  Our  legal  team  provides  holistic  and  comprehensive\nrepresentation to immigrants in the community, including unaccompanied minors, adults,\nand women, children, and families.\n3. GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & Youth program is dedicated to representing indigent\nunaccompanied immigrant children who are not in detention as well as those held in Office\nof Refugee Resettlement (ORR) custody throughout the Galveston-Houston area. This\nprogram was directly impacted by the termination of funds dedicated to unaccompanied\nimmigrant  children.  Core  to  GHIRP’s  mission  and  legal  services,  is  providing\nrepresentation to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth. GHIRP was founded with\nfunding for unaccompanied immigrant children and our first year of services focused\nalmost exclusively on legal services for detained and released unaccompanied immigrant\nchildren.  The contract termination, which cuts funding dedicated to one of our main legal\nservices, perceptibly impairs our core business activities.\n4. In order to carry out our mission, GHIRP has several main work components: (1) providing\neducational and pro se services in the form of legal education “know your rights” (KYR)\npresentations,  conducting  individual  consultations  (intakes),  and  conducting  pro  se\nservices with unrepresented children in ORR custody in the Greater Houston Area; (2)\nrepresenting  unaccompanied  minors  who  are  not  in  ORR  custody  in  immigration\n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 161\n\n(190 of 956), Page 190 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 190 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 8\nproceedings; (3) representing children in ORR custody in immigration proceedings; (4) \nreferring children for pro bono legal services outside of the Galveston-Houston area; and \n(5) providing social services to unaccompanied children. We further host an Immigrant \nJustice Corps (IJC) fellow to represent unaccompanied children in removal proceedings \nand provide Spanish-language tutoring for staff representing unaccompanied children. \n5.  GHIRP  has  been  providing  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  immigrant  children  in \nGalveston  and  Houston  since  2020,  when  the  organization  was  founded.  Since  the \norganization opened, our legal services dedicated to unaccompanied immigrant children \nhave expanded each year.  In 2020, we provided direct representation to approximately 35 \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  In 2021, GHIRP initiated services in a newly opened \nORR facility in Houston (Children's First Residential Care TX Gasmer), providing KYR \npresentations, intakes, direct representation, social services, and referrals for children who \nwere released to other jurisdictions.  In 2023, GHIRP began providing the same legal \nservices to unaccompanied children in a second ORR shelter named LSSS Upbring Krause \nChildren's Center. GHIRP’s direct representation services dedicated to children who are \nnot in custody have also expanded, from 35 cases in our first year of existence (2020) to \nnow serving approximately 300 clients per year (2025).  Currently, GHIRP serves a \ncombined annual number of nearly 1,500 children per year, including approximately 1,500 \nchildren  detained  in  ORR  custody,  approximately  300  children  receiving  direct \nrepresentation services per year, 120-150 children receiving social services per year, and \napproximately 35-50 children receiving pro se assistance per year.  \n6.  Wholly with U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) funding, GHIRP has \nhired 19 staff members dedicated to providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant \nchildren. Specifically, our team comprises seven (7) attorneys, one (1) Department of \nJustice Accredited Representative, nine (9) legal assistants, and two (2) social services \ncoordinators.  As executive director, I oversee the program, support the managing attorney, \nand provide mentorship to the legal team. All staff on GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & \nYouth team are full time employees, and one of the attorneys is an Immigrant Justice Corps \nfellow. Through this contract, we serve recently arriving children in the ORR facilities, as \nwell as released children in the community.   \n7.  GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & Youth team serves detained children who are between the \nages of six (6) and seventeen (17) years old, and non-detained children of all ages. We \nprovide legal services to children within seven to ten (7-10) business days of their arrival \nto the ORR facilities, if not sooner.   \n8.  GHIRP staff provide detained services in the facilities two to four (2-4) times per week, for \napproximately  two  to  four  (2-4)  hours  or  more  each  visit.  Staff  providing  direct \nrepresentation and KYR presentations to children in ORR facilities regularly travel to each \nfacility in person to conduct client interviews, prepare clients for hearings, gather evidence, \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 162\n\n(191 of 956), Page 191 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 191 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 8\nas well as provide legal education, individual consultations, and pro se legal services. Our \nteam also provides “friend of court” legal services so that children appearing in court \nwithout an attorney do not have to appear alone. The courts function more efficiently when \nlegal  representatives  are  involved  as  “friend  of  court”  as  they  explain  technical \nrequirements at preliminary hearings and move the cases along while protecting their \nrights.  GHIRP’s legal team also advocates for children in ORR custody seeking release or \ntransfers, reporting disclosed physical or sexual abuse while in custody, and ensuring that \ntheir basic needs are met by the facility and staff (such as language access and access to \neducation and recreation). If and when a child is released to a location outside of our \ngeographic area, we refer children for legal services in the location where they are going.  \n9.  The GHIRP legal team is trained to provide child-friendly, trauma-informed, culturally \ncompetent services to tender aged children, as well as pre-teen and teenage children.  When \nwe meet the children for the first time, they can be confused, vulnerable, and they often do \nnot understand the complex immigration system that they must navigate. Many children \ndo not understand where they are, why they are in a shelter, or that they have rights.  \nThrough our KYR presentations we teach them about their rights, the immigration system, \nand what they must to do seek relief in the United States.  We also explain what their \nobligations and rights are after they leave the ORR shelter.  \n10. Our staff teaches children about how to identify harmful behavior by caretakers. The goal \nis to provide complex information to children of all ages in a way that they can comprehend \nand retain.  The GHIRP legal team tailors presentations and individual consultations to \nmeet the needs and capacities of each child. We developed materials and resources specific \nto all age groups so that children remain engaged and empowered by our services. During \nindividual consultations, our staff are trained to meet each child at their developmental \nlevel to ensure that the intake is effective and comprehensive.  We have seen firsthand how \nthis information and engagement in our services is critical to preventing trafficking and \nabuse after minors leave the facility, as well as safeguarding their legal rights in the \nimmigration system.  \n11. The  GHIRP  legal  team  provides  representation  to  detained  children  appearing  in \nimmigration court and those who are released to the Galveston-Houston area.  We identify \nchildren who are eligible for legal relief and assist them in preparing their case from the \ninitial filing of the application or appearance in court, to the finality of their case.  We \nrepresent  children  in  matters  before  the  Houston  immigration  courts,  the  Board  of \nImmigration Appeals, federal district courts and petitions for review in circuit courts, as \nwell as children seeking affirmative relief before USCIS and the USCIS Houston Asylum \nOffice, and family court petitions in state court. Our legal team represents children seeking \nhumanitarian relief such as asylum, U-visa and T-visa applications, Special Immigrant \nJuvenile visa petitions, and VAWA petitions.  GHIRP conducts pro se workshops for \nchildren who qualify for legal relief but cannot obtain an attorney to represent them. \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 163\n\n(192 of 956), Page 192 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 192 of 956\n12. Many children that receive our legal services do not speak English, have experienced \ntrauma, and do not have the resources to hire an attorney. Some clients are so young they \ncannot read or write in their own language, much less present a legally sufficient case in \nEnglish in an adversarial court system.  We have represented non-verbal children, children \nwith mental and physical disabilities, and parenting children who have been sexually \nabused from a young age.  Given their particular vulnerabilities, many of our young clients \ndo not have the resources to hire a private attorney and they cannot present a legally \nsufficient case before the court without an attorney by their side. GHIRP’s free, accessible \nrepresentation is their only chance to meaningfully participate in their case and obtain a \nfair outcome. \n13. GHIRP attorneys regularly appear before juvenile docket Immigration Judges for our \nclients that are unaccompanied immigrant children.  The attorneys are knowledgeable \nabout legal issues specific to immigrant children and understand the preferences of the \njudges including required motions and evidence to be filed before hearings. This familiarity \nwith the juvenile judges and issues ensures efficient adjudication of cases, or dismissals of \nremoval proceedings where relief is available outside of the court. By frequently appearing \nwith children in the courts, GHIRP attorneys are able to effectively prepare our child clients \nfor hearings, eliminating the stress and trauma of appearing before an Immigration Judge.  \n14. Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) \nissued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied Children, \neffective immediately, which extended to all five Contract Line Numbers (CLINs). Without \nfurther elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.” \nHHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation to GHIRP on February \n21, 2025. \n \n15. On March 21, 2025, also without warning, GHIRP learned that HHS (through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice (to which our organization is a subcontractor) that funds GHIRP’s legal services for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025. \nHHS terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Item Numbers \n(CLINs): CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children, as well as other non-\nrepresentation  services,  such  as  referrals  and  data  tracking;  CLIN  3,  which  funds \nImmigrant Justice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under \nCLIN 2; and CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with \nchildren. For the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR \npresentations and confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities. Per \nthe  partial  termination,  HHS  ordered  Acacia  and  all  subcontractors  to  stop  work \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 164\n\n(193 of 956), Page 193 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 193 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 8\nimmediately on CLINs 2, 3, and 4. HHS provided no justification for the partial termination \nother than “the Government’s convenience.”  \n16.  I received notification of the contract termination by email. I notified the Immigrant \nChildren & Youth team that the contract was terminated effective immediately, and that \nwork on cases under the contract should stop due to a lack of funding. As a team, we \nassessed our cases that are currently in progress, our clients’ reliance on our representation, \nimmediate next steps for clients, and work that needed to be prioritized given the time-\nsensitive nature of the cases.    \n17. Notification of the contract termination has significantly impacted our organization, staff, \nand clients. GHIRP currently represents 292 clients with funding from the current contract \nwith Acacia Center for Justice. Our youngest client is two (2) years old. We represent \nclients who have imminent hearings, filing deadlines, and time-sensitive motions before \nthe court.  Our clients are scheduled to appear in court as soon as April 2, 9, and 10, 2025. \nThe April 2, 2025 hearing is for a detained client who needs to file relief and be prepared \nto plead in his second setting in Immigration Court, which has necessitated urgent work to \nprepare an application this week. Another client has an Individual Hearing on April 9, 2025 \nthat will require substantial attorney preparation time, in addition to working closely with \nthe client on his testimony, and another client has a filing deadline for that same day.   \n18. Some cases require complex legal arguments, such as our client who is contesting the \njudge’s jurisdictional decision related to his asylum claim. The law entitles this client to \nexplicit procedural due process protections for unaccompanied children, including filing \nhis asylum application with the asylum office first. Our attorney has filed two separate \nmotions and appeared at a hearing related to this issue and is scheduled to appear again in \ncourt to resolve the matter.  Our young client will not be able to advocate for his rights \nalone if we are forced to abruptly withdraw from his case.   \n19. GHIRP’s IJC Fellow represents “Evelyn,” a 12-year-old girl from Mexico who has endured \nsignificant abuse starting at a very young age.  Before entering the United States, she was \nlabor trafficked at the young age of 5 years old and endured physical and sexual abuse at \nthe hands of her caretakers who were her extended family members. We assisted Evelyn in \nfiling her asylum application and are in the process of gathering documentation and \ninformation to file a T-visa application. These forms of relief will ensure that she can stay \nin the U.S. with her sponsor and heal from her past trafficking and abuse. Evelyn was issued \na Notice to Appear and will soon be required to appear in the Houston Immigration Court. \nTo withdraw from her case at this stage would likely result in her abandoning both forms \nof relief and being forced to return to the very dangers she fled. \n \n20. GHIRP also represents “Rosa,” a 15-year-old girl from Honduras, in her immigration case \nseeking both SIJS and asylum.  When we met Rosa, she was incapable of speaking due to \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 165\n\n(194 of 956), Page 194 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 194 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 8\nher severe trauma.  She would sit silently with her attorney, picking at her skin and \nrepeating nervous ticks due to her extreme discomfort and anxiety.  Through multiple \nmeetings and building rapport, Rosa disclosed her history of parental abandonment and \nneglect, as well as surviving sexual abuse in her home country. She continues to display \nextensive distress related to her past trauma.  GHIRP filed her asylum application (which \nis currently pending) and her family court case is pending in state court, which forms the \nbasis for an application for SIJS.  Rosa is not capable of complying with family court \nrequirements for service of process, establishing parentage, and meeting the legal standards \nfor the requested proposed order without an attorney representing her.  Furthermore, she \nwill soon be required to appear in the Houston Immigration Court and will need her trusted \nattorney to represent her in those proceedings as well. \n21. These clients have an expectation that GHIRP will timely prepare their case, appear in \ncourt  on  their  behalf,  and  complete  the  case  in  accordance  with  our  attorney-client \nrepresentation agreements. In order to comply with our client obligations, we have had to \nutilize operating expenses that were set aside for other purposes because we are not able to \nhalt legal representation on a moment’s notice.   \n22. GHIRP’s legal team will not withdraw from client cases immediately.  Our management \nteam is determining how long we can continue representing our clients without funding, \nconsidering the number of clients we represent, the procedural posture of each case, and \nthe staff capacity for casework with a reduced team due to funding.  Due to the sudden \ncontract termination, we must decide which cases to retain, and which staff will remain at \nthe organization (if any). GHIRP attorneys and representatives have an ethical duty to \nrepresent our current clients and to advocate for their interests.  To abruptly withdraw from \nour clients’ cases will be detrimental to their legal case, and a direct impairment to our \nexisting core activities. Clients will age out of legal relief, may be forced to abandon relief \ndue to missed filing deadlines, and/or they will not be able to pursue their cases in court \neffectively alone without representation.  Our attorneys are the attorney of record in \nimmigration court and state court, and judges may not allow for our withdrawal at such a \nlate stage of the case.  If they do allow for withdrawal, our young clients will not have the \ntime and resources to obtain new counsel within the courts’ deadlines and/or scheduled \nhearings.  \n23. The financial impact of the contract termination profoundly affects GHIRP, as the entire \ncontract for legal services for unaccompanied children represents approximately 45% of \nour organizational budget and staff. Our organization served 2,625 immigrants in the \ncommunity last year, of which 1,469 (or 57%) were unaccompanied children receiving \nservices through this contract.  GHIRP is not able to maintain the same level of legal \nservices for unaccompanied minors without HHS funding, and we will be required to lay \noff most of our Immigrant Children and Youth staff in approximately four weeks. We will \nrely on unrestricted funds and savings to pay staff during this time, however, drawing down \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 166\n\n(195 of 956), Page 195 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 195 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-17     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 8\non these funds will destabilize the organization as a whole. This will divert unrestricted \nfunds away from other services, as these resources typically cover gaps in funding between \ncontract  cycles  on  other  grants,  underfunded  programs,  or  new  initiatives  that  are \nresponsive to emerging needs of the community.  \n24. GHIRP’s staff members serving immigrant children and youth are exceptionally passionate \nabout providing legal services to children and are currently distraught by the recent contract \ntermination. All have had formal and/or on-the-job training related to educating and \nrepresenting children and youth and have developed unique skills to provide child-friendly \nlegal services.  Over the years, our team has built rapport with our clients, assisted them in \nnavigating personal and legal issues, and dedicated a significant amount of time and \nresources to zealously advocating for their clients.  Through our services, we hope to \nachieve our goals of obtaining safety and stability for our clients so that they can thrive.  \nAn interruption in services risks re-traumatizing them and causing them to lose the progress \nthey  have  made  so  far  in  their  trajectory  toward  opportunity.  The  abrupt  contract \ntermination has impacted staff morale and caused incredible amounts of stress. Having to \nwithdraw representation may be a violation of our ethical duties to our clients and will \nlikely lead to their deportation, placing our clients in harm’s way.  Our children view our \nteam as a reliable support, which many clients lack in other aspects of their lives. These \nconsequences deeply impact our staff, who are dedicated, compassionate professionals. \n25. Such results are antithetical to our values and impede our ability to carry out GHIRP’s \nmission. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n  \nExecuted on the 25th of March 2025, in Houston, Texas.           \n            \n_/s/ Elizabeth Sanchez Kennedy______ \nElizabeth Sanchez Kennedy \nExecutive Director \n6001 Savoy Drive, Ste. 400 \nHouston, Texas 77036 \nPh: (713) 588-2260 \nEmail: Chiqui@ghirp.org \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 167\n\n(196 of 956), Page 196 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 196 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 9\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF WENDY YOUNG \nPALO ALTO, et al., \n(KIND) IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \n \nMOTION FOR A TEMPORARY \nPlaintiffs, \nRESTRAINING ORDER AND \nv.

Pursuant  to  28 \nU.S.C. § 1746, I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statements are true and correct.  \n1.  My name is Wendy Young, and I am the President of KIND, Inc., doing business as Kids \nin  Need  of  Defense  (“KIND”).  KIND  is  the  leading  international  not-for-profit \norganization devoted to protecting the rights and well-being of unaccompanied and \nseparated children.  Founded in 2008, KIND now has seventeen locations across the \nUnited States that have provided legal rights education to more than 78,000 children, and \nlegal representation in immigration matters to more than 17,000 children in the United \nStates. KIND staff provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children who \nare in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) at 20 short-term shelter care or foster care facilities, \nfive long-term foster care programs, and three Unaccompanied Refugee Minor (URM) \nprograms served by KIND’s offices in Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA; Fresno, CA; Hartford, \nCT; Houston, TX; Los Angeles, CA; New York, NY; Sacramento, CA; and Seattle, WA.  \nKIND also serves children released from ORR care and living in the communities served \nby those offices and by our offices and locations in Baltimore, MD; the District of \nColumbia; Jacksonville, FL; Newark, NJ; Northern Virginia; Orlando, FL; Providence, \nRI; and San Francisco, CA. \n2.  KIND provides representation and other services to migrant children in part through its \nstaff, and in part through pro bono partnerships with nearly 900 law firms, corporations, \nlaw  schools,  and  bar  associations,  whose  lawyers  provide  children  with  pro  bono \nrepresentation with training and support from KIND.  KIND also provides psychosocial \nsupport to children and families; works to address the root causes of child migration; and \nadvocates for laws, policies, and practices to improve the protection of unaccompanied \nchildren within the U.S. and abroad. \n(1) During children’s time in ORR custody, KIND conducts educational “know your \nrights” (“KYR”) presentations that provide unaccompanied children with information \nabout the immigration system, their rights and responsibilities, and what to expect in \nimmigration  court.    KIND  also  conducts  legal  screenings  to  assess  each  child’s \nprotection needs and evaluate options for legal relief as well as making appropriate \nreferrals for further legal or social services during or after ORR custody.  As needed, \nKIND may also support children in requests for release on recognizance or with \nnotifications relating to changes of address and venue.  \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 169\n\n(198 of 956), Page 198 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 198 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 9\n(2) During ORR custody, if a child is required to attend immigration court, KIND will \neducate the child about immigration court processes and prepare them to attend the \nhearing, and will accompany the child to court in the capacity of “friend of the court” \nor, in limited circumstances, as attorney of record.  \n(3) During ORR custody, KIND may provide legal representation for certain children \nwhere services as “friend of the court” are not sufficient for the child’s needs – for \nexample, for children who are required to enter pleadings in their immigration removal \nproceedings during their time in ORR care, or children who are placed in federal long-\nterm foster care. \n(4) Many children who live in communities served by KIND following release from \nORR custody receive free legal representation through KIND’s network of pro bono \nattorneys and/or KIND staff.  The KIND mentor assigned to each pro bono attorney \noffers specialized training programs and guidance on substantive law and skills needed \nfor representing children, addresses the pro bono attorney’s questions, consults on case \nstrategy, offers access to psychosocial services and other resources, and provides \nsupport at all phases of a child’s immigration case.  KIND staff and KIND pro bono \nattorneys  represent  children  in  proceedings  before  the  immigration  courts,  in \nadministrative  proceedings  before  U.S.  Citizenship  and  Immigration  Services \n(USCIS), in ancillary proceedings in state courts, and occasionally before the Board of \nImmigration Appeals, federal district courts, or federal courts of appeal. \n4.  KIND’s five original offices began providing legal services for released unaccompanied \nimmigrant children through pro bono partnerships in January 2009, with two of those \noffices  adding  services  for  detained  children  later  that  year.  Over  time,  KIND’s \nprogramming  expanded  to  include  additional  locations  in  the  United  States,  plus  a \nprogram dedicated to serving children separated from their parents.  Beyond the United \nStates, KIND has staff in Mexico, Central America, and several countries in Europe, with \na focus on protection, family unity, and strengthening child protection systems and access \nto lawful immigration pathways. KIND works with organizational and private sector \npartners to harness additional capacity in those regions.   \n5.  For the period January 2022 through December 2024 inclusive, KIND’s subcontract with \nAcacia supported know-your-rights presentations and legal screenings to over 16,900 \nchildren  in  ORR  custody,  immigration  legal  representation  for  approximately  6,700 \nchildren  through  KIND  and  its  pro  bono  attorneys,  and  psychosocial  services  for \napproximately 2,400 children.  During the same period, through other contracts and other \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 170\n\n(199 of 956), Page 199 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 199 of 956\nresources, KIND and its pro bono partners additionally represented approximately 3,700 \nchildren, and KIND provided psychosocial services to approximately 1,100 children.   \n6.  In or about March 2022, KIND entered into a subcontract with the Vera Institute of Justice \nto  deliver  specified  legal  services  to  children  arriving  in  the  United  States  as \nunaccompanied children, renewable annually over a five-year period. KIND’s current \ncontract with Acacia Center for Justice is a novation of that contract.  The KIND-Acacia \nsubcontract is in turn funded by a contract between Acacia and ORR.  All of KIND’s \nseventeen locations in the United States deliver legal and social services funded through \nits subcontract with Acacia. From 2009 through 2021, KIND served children pursuant to \nsubcontracts with Acacia’s predecessor, the Vera Institute for Justice.        \n7.  KIND staff regularly travel to almost twenty ORR shelter care and transitional foster care \nfacilities in person, while one shelter regularly arranges for groups of children to visit the \nlocal KIND office in person due to capacity limitations at the ORR facility.  The frequency \nof these visits varies with need, but on average, each KIND site held about four visits per \nmonth during 2024.  KIND uses these visits to provide know-your-rights presentations, \nconduct legal screenings, prepare clients for court hearings, or conduct individual legal \nconsultations.  KIND staff also represent children placed in federal long-term foster care \nand in the Unaccompanied Refugee Minors program.  \n8.  Immigration  removal  proceedings  are  adversarial  proceedings  commenced  by  the \nDepartment of Homeland Security before immigration courts within the Department of \nJustice.  Unaccompanied  children,  including  very  young  children,  are  named  as \n“respondents,” and must answer charges of removability and bear the burden of proof to \nestablish a defense to forcible removal to countries where their rights, well-being, safety, \nor even their lives were at risk.  The free legal and psychosocial services provided by \nKIND, and by other ORR-funded legal services providers, are essential to protecting the \nbasic rights of children facing this process. Unaccompanied children do not have the \nfinancial resources to hire private counsel at market rates, and in KIND’s experience, few \nhave family members of such means.  Without free services, unaccompanied children -- \nincluding  very  young,  pre-verbal,  and  non-walking  children  --  would  be  forced  to \nrepresent themselves through complex legal processes, facing trained and experienced \ngovernment counsel while striving to present evidence and legal arguments in their own \ndefense.   \n9.  Legal screenings by KIND staff for children in ORR custody serve to determine whether \nit is unsafe for a child to return to their country of origin, and to identify options for \navailable legal relief in the United States. These assessments are necessary prerequisites \nto placement with pro bono attorneys who primarily practice in areas of law other than \nimmigration, and depend on KIND for case assessments, training, practice guidance, and \nongoing mentorship.  KIND’s pro bono partners contributed approximately 1,487,244 \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 171\n\n(200 of 956), Page 200 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 200 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 9\nhours of legal services, valued at over $889,000,000 dollars from 2009 to 2023. Thus, pro \nbono representation with KIND mentorship multiplies the effectiveness of the funding \nORR provides to KIND. \n10.  Through legal representation by KIND or its pro bono partners, children pursue one or \nmore forms of humanitarian relief, such as protection from parental maltreatment through \nspecial immigrant juvenile status, asylum based on a fear of persecution, T- or U-visas that \nprotect victims of trafficking or other serious crimes, or temporary protected status based \non untenable conditions in the country of origin.  Children’s immigration cases have long \ntimelines:  in KIND’s experience, while a small proportion of cases resulting in permanent \nstatus are completed within two years, the majority take five to seven years to complete, \nwith some taking longer.  The chief reason is adjudication timelines.  The immigration \ncourt backlog currently stands at well over 3.6 million cases, with wait times between \nhearings  typically  stretching  to  months  or  years.    Moreover,  most  applications  for \nhumanitarian relief are adjudicated outside immigration courts.  In 2024, USCIS stated \nthat over 1.1 million asylum applications were pending before it, and applicants for other \nforms of relief likewise face years-long delays, most notably, the years-long waits for the \nlimited supply of visas affecting special immigrant juveniles waiting to apply for green \ncards.   These delays are beyond the control of children and their advocates.  In addition, \nthe process of preparing children’s applications for relief is time-consuming for several \nreasons.  First, depending on the relief sought, evidentiary support for applications may \ninclude elements that require time and effort to obtain, such as: state juvenile court orders \nissued after evidentiary hearings; attestations by state or federal law enforcement officers; \nand/or medical, psychological, or other expert evaluations.  In cases where a child’s initial \nrequest for relief is not approved, further time may be required to respond to requests for \nevidence or notices of intent to deny, as well as for appellate processes.  Second, children \nin general, and particularly those who have experienced traumatic events, will need time \nto develop trust in unfamiliar adults and in the legal process itself, as the American Bar \nAssociation has recognized in cautioning against pressuring children to discuss distressing \nexperiences before they are ready to do so.  Third and more generally, preparation of a \nchild’s case takes time due to the capacity limitations inherent in children’s ongoing \ncognitive  and  emotional  development.   As  a  principal  drafter  of  the  2008 TVPRA \nexplained, a child “usually knows nothing about U.S. courts or immigration policies and \nfrequently does not speak English . . . . The majority of these children have been forced to \nstruggle through an immigration system designed for adults.” (Cong. Rec. S10886 (Dec. \n10, 2008) (Sen. Feinstein)).  State codes of professional responsibility typically require \nattorneys representing children with diminished capacity to maintain a normal attorney-\nclient relationship to the greatest extent possible, and under American Bar Association \nstandards, children must be afforded the right to meaningfully participate in decision-\nmaking  in  their  cases.   Accordingly,  best  practices  for  representing  unaccompanied \nchildren  contemplate  applying  trauma-informed  and  child-sensitive  practices  and \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 172\n\n(201 of 956), Page 201 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 201 of 956\naffording sufficient time to support the child client’s understanding of the proceedings and \ndeliberation on matters affecting the child’s well-being.  Fourth, children are not self-\nsufficient, so their participation in preparing a legal case depends on facilitation by \nindividual or institutional caregivers who may present time constraints that are beyond a \nchild’s control – for example, something as simple as a caregiver being unable to obtain \nleave from work to transport a child to a session with an attorney or expert.  In sum, \nrepresenting  children  in  immigration  matters  requires  a  sustained  multi-year  time \ncommitment in order to meet stringent evidentiary burdens, present effective advocacy, \nand support children in navigating complex and high-stakes processes.   \n11.  Officials  with  government  agencies  have  repeatedly  recognized  how  KIND’s  work \ncontributes to their efficient and effective operations in handling children’s cases.  Among \nother  contributions,  at  the  request  of  agency  officials,  KIND  staff  have  conducted \nnumerous training programs on topics relating to children’s immigration matters for staff \nof the immigration courts, USCIS, and the ICE Office of the Principal Legal Advisor \n(OPLA), which represents the government in removal proceedings. As one example \namong many, after KIND staff presented to USCIS asylum office staff on child-friendly \ninterviewing techniques, senior officials of the office sent handwritten notes thanking \nKIND staff for the program.  The office director stated, “I know our officers will greatly \nbenefit from it!” and one training officer added, “We hope we can make it an annual \nevent.”  \n12.  Another example is a well-received initiative by KIND’s Boston office to accelerate the \nsuccessful completion of numerous pending cases of KIND clients awaiting adjudication \nof their applications for lawful permanent residency (LPR) status, also known as a green \ncard.  LPR applicants have already cleared high legal standards and progressed through \nyears-long waiting lists, only to wait again for scheduling of a merits hearing date in \nimmigration court.  To alleviate that bottleneck, during 2021, KIND staff identified dozens \nof clients who were immediately eligible to adjust status, lacking only a date on the court’s \ncalendar for an adjustment hearing.  Normally, just a handful of cases would be scheduled \nfor an adjustment hearing on a given date, but through KIND’s coordination with OPLA \nattorneys and immigration court staff, 50 adjustment-ready cases were calendared on two \nselected dates in May and November 2021.  By organizing required information to share \nwith OPLA in advance, KIND helped to ensure a smooth and efficient hearing for each \ncase.  The court approved 21 cases on the May 2021 date, 25 children on the November \n2021 date, and the remainder on follow-up dates.  Both the immigration court and OPLA \npraised KIND for efficiencies that resulted in removing cases in bulk from the court’s \ncrowded docket as the KIND clients received permanent status.   \n13.  On the afternoon of February 18, 2025, Acacia emailed KIND a redacted copy of a \nnationwide order that HHS (through the U.S. Department of the Interior) issued to stop \nwork  under  the  Legal  Services  for  Unaccompanied  Children  contract,  effective \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 173\n\n(202 of 956), Page 202 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 202 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 9\nimmediately.  The stop-work order applied to all lines of work performed under the \ncontract, including KIND’s work on KYR presentations and legal screenings for children \nin ORR facilities, and legal representation for unaccompanied children in and outside \nORR custody.  Without further elaboration, the stop work order stated that it “shall remain \nin place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented due to causes outside \nof your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for poor performance.”  \n14.  Based on the directives in the stop-work order, KIND instructed staff to immediately \nsuspend visits to facilities served under the contract, stop accepting new referrals, cancel \nintake meetings with prospective clients, and not sign retainer agreements to take on new \nclients. KIND also instructed staff to continue critical ongoing work necessary to fulfill \nprofessional responsibilities to clients, including meeting filing deadlines and attending \nscheduled hearings and administrative interviews with clients.  On the afternoon of \nFebruary 21, 2025, KIND learned from Acacia that HHS had rescinded the stop-work \norder, without explanation.   \n15.  On March 21, 2025, Acacia informed KIND via email that Acacia had received a notice \npartially terminating Contract 140D0422C0009, under which KIND is a subcontractor, for \nthe government’s convenience.  Acacia stated that the contract was terminated effective \nthat same date for three of the four Contract Line Numbers (CLINs), and directed that \nwork stop immediately under CLIN2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children \nnot in ORR custody; CLIN3, which funds Immigrant Justice Corps fellows to represent \nunaccompanied children separately from those represented through CLIN 2; and CLIN4, \nSpanish  language  tutoring  for  organizational  staff  who  work  with  children.  KIND \nunderstands that only CLIN1, which funds KYR presentations and confidential legal \nconsultations for unrepresented children in ORR facilities, remains in place, and is \nawaiting guidance from Acacia regarding whether there will be revisions to the relevant \ntask orders, such as modifications to KYR services and any attendant budget or staffing \nchanges.  \n16.  Partial termination of the Acacia contract deprives KIND of the funding KIND relies on \nto employ approximately 350 professionals actively engaged in delivering or supporting \nthe legal representation of some 6,700 clients.  KIND cannot retain employees once \ncontractual funding sources are unavailable, and we anticipate significant layoffs, starting \nwithin days of the contract termination. This interruption of employment disrupts the \nproductivity, career development, and morale of scores of qualified and experienced \nworkers who are skilled and experienced in serving unaccompanied children, and who \ncannot easily find replacement opportunities due to the broad geographic scope of the \npartial contract termination.  More importantly, the partial contract termination makes the \nqualifications and experience of these employees unavailable to children in need of \nspecialized services.  Most funding KIND has received through other sources is dedicated \nto employing staff who provide specified services to additional clients through other \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 174\n\n(203 of 956), Page 203 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 203 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-18     Filed 03/27/25     Page 8 of 9\nprograms, and thus such employees and funding cannot compensate for the needs created \nby the partial contract termination.   \n17.  Partial  termination  of  the Acacia  contract  will  disrupt  thousands  of  attorney-client \nrelationships on which children have relied, for multiple years in some cases, and leaves \nchildren without support for the completion of their pending cases. The sudden disruption \nof an established attorney-client relationship would be a blow for children who have \ninvested time to develop a relationship of trust, particularly in the wake of traumatic \nexperiences that led them to migrate in search of safety.  This is particularly so because \nchild clients benefit from a trauma-informed and child-centered practice as is cultivated at \nKIND.  Many children served through KIND face impending deadlines or events in their \ncases. As of the date of this declaration, approximately 200 clients represented by KIND \nstaff or by pro bono attorneys receiving KIND’s mentorship are scheduled for master or \nindividual hearings in immigration courts in the next 60 days.  This includes clients with \nimmigration court hearings docketed for March 25, March 27, and April 8.  A similar \nnumber of other required actions are scheduled in KIND’s cases in the next 60 days, \nincluding hearings in state court proceedings, deadlines to respond to requests for evidence \nin connection with immigration applications, and other filing deadlines and events.   \n18.  KIND relied on contractual funding to commence representation in thousands of matters \nthat, as discussed above, require years to complete.  ORR’s partial termination of the \ncontract will not automatically suspend pending removal proceedings nor resolve pending \napplications for relief.  Nor will the partial contract termination automatically suspend \ndeadlines in children’s cases, such as requirements to file an application or motion within \na  specified  time  period  or  before  a  client  reaches  a  specified  age.    KIND  retains \nprofessional obligations toward these thousands of vulnerable clients.

The partial termination of the Acacia contract impedes KIND’s mission of ensuring that\n    no child appears in immigration court without high-quality legal representation.  For all\n               of the reasons discussed here, KIND believes that the partial termination of the Acacia\n            contract  will  upset  children’s  serious  reliance  interests  in  ongoing  attorney-client\n           relationships,  diminish  fairness,  implicate  due  process  considerations, impede the\n      efficiency and effectiveness of court and agency processes due to increased numbers of\n    unrepresented children, andthereby risk severe harm to children who have relied on their\n   attorneys to see their claims for protection and relief through to conclusion.    \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.   \n      Executed on the25th of March2025, inFalls Church, Virginia         \n              \n    /s/  Wend y Youn g  \nWendy Young \nPresident \nKids in Need of Defense\nPO Box 27839 \nWashington, DC 20038\n \n8 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 176\n\n(205 of 956), Page 205 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 205 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 1 of 7\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nDECLARATION OF MIGUEL ANGEL \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nMEXICANO  FURMANSKA IN \n \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING \nv.

I certify under(cid:2271)penalty(cid:2271)of(cid:2271)perjury(cid:2271)that the following statement \nis true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C.(cid:2271)§(cid:2271)1746. \n1.  I, Miguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska, serve as Managing Attorney and Proprietor of the \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano, PC. \n \n2.  The Law Office of Miguel Mexicano provides comprehensive legal representation to \nvulnerable unaccompanied children facing immigration legal challenges.  Our practice \nextends to children released from Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody to \nfamily members or guardians in the Los Angeles metropolitan area.  Additionally, we stand \nas the legal service provider for children remaining in ORR custody within the long-term \nfoster care provider at MarSell Wellness Center in Ontario, California. \n \n3.  Our dedicated team is comprised of attorneys and legal professionals who have devoted \ntheir careers to advocating for society’s most vulnerable populations.  Our mission centers \non  protecting  unaccompanied  children,  arguably  the  most  defenseless  subset  of \nimmigrants, through zealous representation in  deportation proceedings, navigation of \napplications for legal relief with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (“USCIS”), \nand educational outreach through “know your rights” (“KYR”) presentations. \n \n4.  The Law Office of Miguel Mexicano fulfills its mission through five essential service \ncomponents:    (1)  Representing  unaccompanied  minors  outside  ORR  custody  in \nimmigration proceedings;  (2) Advocating for children within ORR custody throughout \ntheir immigration journey;  (3) Delivering vital legal education through KYR presentations;  \n(4) Providing specialized representation in state court proceedings for minors eligible for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (“SIJS”);  and (5) Representing children during critical \nasylum interviews before USCIS. \n \n5.  Since 2016, the Law Office of Miguel Mexicano has established itself as a steadfast \nprovider of legal services for unaccompanied immigrant children throughout California, \nthough our formal subcontractor relationship with ORR began in September 2023.  Our \ncommitment to this vital work stems from our extensive expertise in advocating for \nunaccompanied  children,  including  my  personal  12-year  experience  in  this  field.  \nCurrently, our practice extends representation to approximately 120 children, including a \nselect cohort of minors in ORR custody at MarSell Wellness Center in Ontario, California. \n \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 178\n\n(207 of 956), Page 207 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 207 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 3 of 7\n6.  Through U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) funding, our firm has \nassembled  a  dedicated  team  of  11  full-time  professionals  committed  to  serving \nunaccompanied immigrant children.  This exceptional team includes six attorneys with \nspecialized immigration expertise, three skilled paralegals, and a dedicated legal assistant, \nall working under my leadership. \n \n7.  Our practice involves regular visitation with foster care clients and vigorous representation \nbefore the Immigration Court.  We further extend our advocacy to children pursuing asylum \nthrough the asylum office and navigate state court proceedings for those qualifying for \nSIJS—a critical form of relief designed specifically for children who have suffered abuse, \nabandonment, or neglect.  Beyond legal representation, we serve as holistic advocates, \nfacilitating connections to essential social services, healthcare resources, and mental health \nsupport.   \n \n8.  The majority of our clients qualify for either SIJS or asylum.  These legal pathways demand \nthe expertise of skilled counsel to navigate successfully.  These children have endured \ntraumatic experiences of abuse, neglect, or persecution in their countries of origin, creating \nlegal complexities that would be insurmountable without professional legal guidance.  \n \n9.  Know Your Rights presentations and legal representation are essential for unaccompanied \nchildren who face multiple barriers to justice.  Most cannot afford private representation, \nwith typical legal fees starting at $5,000.  Language barriers severely limit their ability to \nunderstand proceedings, as most speak Spanish or indigenous languages.  Immigration \nlaw’s complexity—with intricate procedures, strict deadlines, and specialized standards—\nis incomprehensible even to many adults.  The geographic isolation of facilities and limited \ntransportation and distance from courts further restricts access to legal help. Even in a \nregion like mine -Los Angeles- with ample Spanish speaking resources, there is a severe \nshortage  of  attorneys  with  the  specialized  expertise  required  for  these  cases—\nencompassing immigration law, state law, and trauma-informed advocacy.  Only a handful \nof nonprofit and private attorneys are equipped to handle these matters.  Without our \nservices, many children would face near-certain deportation, regardless of their legal \neligibility for relief or the dangers awaiting them in their countries of origin. \n \n10. One illustrative case involved a young girl who diligently attempted to monitor her \nImmigration Court proceedings by periodically contacting the court system to determine \nher hearing schedule.  Despite her best efforts, she received either late notification or no \nnotification at all regarding her hearing, resulting in an “in absentia” removal order.  She \nwas ordered removed from the country for failing to appear in court.  Upon accepting her \nrepresentation,  we  immediately  identified  her  eligibility  for  SIJS  based  on  paternal \nabandonment.  We  promptly  initiated  custody  proceedings  in  state  court  while \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 179\n\n(208 of 956), Page 208 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 208 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 4 of 7\nsimultaneously filing a motion to reopen with the Immigration Court.  Through our \nintervention, this young client successfully reopened her case and secured the necessary \npredicate order to pursue a Special Immigrant Juvenile visa.  Our timely representation \ntransformed her circumstances from imminent deportation to a clear pathway toward \nlawful permanent residency. \n \n11. Our  legal  team  receives  consistent  recognition  and  welcome  across  various  venues \nincluding Immigration Court and USCIS, and during interactions with the Office of \nPrincipal Legal Advisor (“OPLA”)/Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), as we \nfacilitate streamlined processes and advocate for justice.  Immigration Court judges have \nrepeatedly acknowledged the positive impact of our representation on children’s lives and \nour contribution to creating more efficient and humane Immigration Court proceedings.  \nOur  professional  engagement  enables  productive  communication  with  government \nattorneys  to  advance  and  resolve  cases  expeditiously.    In  one  notable  instance,  an \nImmigration Judge in Santa Ana explicitly expressed gratitude for our meticulous work in \nhelping a minor seek and obtain relief effectively and efficiently.  The judge acknowledged \nthat our diligent  representation transformed the entire process, leading to a positive \noutcome that might  otherwise have resulted in years of procedural delays, potential \nviolations of due process rights, and ultimately, deportation.  Our intervention prevented \nburdensome continuances and the overwhelming complexity that a vulnerable child would \nface navigating the system alone. \n \n12. We have garnered similar judicial recognition in state court proceedings while pursuing \nSIJS through Probate and Family Courts.  Judges in these forums have commended our \nexemplary  filings  and  professional  conduct,  even  suggesting  that  our  team  provide \neducational training to other attorneys practicing in this specialized field. \n \n13.  Without warning, on February 18, 2025, HHS (through the U.S. Department of the \nInterior) issued a national contract stop work order for Legal Services for Unaccompanied \nChildren,  effective  immediately,  which  extended  to  all  four Contract  Line Numbers \n(CLINs). Without further elaboration on duration or reasoning, the stop work order stated \nthat it “shall remain in place until you are notified otherwise” and “is being implemented \ndue to causes outside of your control and should not be misconstrued as an indication for \npoor performance.” HHS then later rescinded the stop work order without explanation on \nFebruary 21, 2025. \n \n14. The timing of the initial work stoppage order was particularly disruptive, arriving on \nTuesday, February 18, 2025, mid-week during a period when our office had scheduled at \nleast 10 hearings across immigration and state courts for our unaccompanied minor clients. \nThis disruption coincided with an approaching critical filing deadline for unaccompanied \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 180\n\n(209 of 956), Page 209 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 209 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 5 of 7\nminors who potentially qualified as members of the J.O.P. v. DHS lawsuit—a certified \nnationwide class action challenging a Trump administration policy that restricted asylum \neligibility  for  certain  unaccompanied  children  arriving  from  2019  onward. With  the \ndeadline set for February 24, 2025, we were in the final stages of preparing numerous \nasylum applications for affected minors.  \n \n15. On March 21, 2025, the situation dramatically worsened. HHS (operating through the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior) partially terminated the current contract with Acacia Center for \nJustice  (to  which  our  organization  is  a  subcontractor)  that  funds  legal  services  for \nunaccompanied children. This termination was effective the same day, March 21, 2025.  \nThis directive terminated the contract with respect to 3 of the 4 Contract Line Numbers \n(CLINs):  CLIN 2, Legal representation for unaccompanied children as well as other non-\nrepresentation services such as referrals and data tracking; CLIN 3, which funds Immigrant \nJustice Corps fellows who represent unaccompanied children not covered under CLIN 2, \nand CLIN 4, Spanish language tutoring for organizational staff who work with children. \nFor the time being, HHS has left in place only CLIN 1, which funds KYR presentations \nand confidential legal consultations for pro se children in ORR facilities.  Per the partial \ntermination, HHS ordered Acacia and all subcontractors to stop work immediately on \nCLINs 2, 3, and 4.  HHS provided no justification for the partial termination other than \n“the Government’s convenience.”  \n \n16. This contract termination has necessitated immediate and difficult communications with \nMarSell Wellness Center Ontario. On March 21, 2025, I personally informed the Center's \nDirector  that  all  our  services  would  cease  immediately,  except  for  the  minimal \nrepresentation  legally  and  ethically  required  for  children  with  already  scheduled \nImmigration Court proceedings. I explained that we would be unable to help any new \narrivals at their facility, and that with all existing cases we would need to wind down our \nservices where ethically possible. This abrupt cessation of services places considerable \nstrain on the facility, which now must attempt to secure alternative legal representation in \na region with few qualified immigration attorneys willing to take on these specialized \ncases. I don’t believe the center has a contingency plan in place and they will likely need \nto divert resources from other critical services to address this sudden gap in legal support. \n \n17. The moment the aforementioned contract was terminated, it created an immediate crisis \nfor our vulnerable child clients. After assessing our ethical duties and limited resources, the \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano can continue representing only the most pressing of our \napproximately 120 unaccompanied minors—specifically those with court dates or filing \ndeadlines.  This week for instance, we have immigration court scheduled for a minor on \nFriday, Mach 28, 2025, a Probate Court hearing on Wednesday March 26, 2025, and a Long \nTerm Foster Care client that wants to pursue voluntary departure because she wants to \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 181\n\n(210 of 956), Page 210 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 210 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 6 of 7\nreturn to her home country because of an ill grandmother. Not knowing whether this \nunavoidable work will be funded is creating tremendous strain on our office. For all other \ncases, we must regrettably start to unwind and withdraw representation where ethically \npossible, filing appropriate motions with immigration courts and providing clients with \ncase files  and guidance materials, though this offers minimal practical assistance to \nchildren  navigating  complex  legal  proceedings.  This  abrupt  termination  undermines \nprotections  established  by  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection \nReauthorization Act  (TVPRA)  of  2008,  which  recognized  unaccompanied  children's \nvulnerabilities and established safeguards including access to counsel. Our clients have \ndeveloped trusted relationships with our attorneys, often sharing traumatic experiences \nforming the basis of their legal claims. Without HHS funding, hundreds of children across \nour region will face deportation proceedings unrepresented, effectively nullifying their \nright to seek humanitarian protection despite legal eligibility. \n18. This termination impacts approximately 80% of our operational funding. The financial \nconsequences—including potential furloughs, layoffs, or significant staff reduction—will \nbe  devastating.  I’ve  already  communicated  with  my  team  that  they  in  fact  may  be \nfurloughed or laid off. As of Monday March 24, 2025, I cut my staff’s hours in half. Very \nsoon I will likely be forced to lay off half my staff, severely compromising our ability to \nfulfill our ethical obligations to clients. As the firm’s owner and manager, I am facing \nextreme overtime demands to sustain operations while enduring substantial financial losses \nthat might reach in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. Ultimately, continuing our \nrepresentation of unaccompanied minors is financially unsustainable. \n \n19. Beyond its operational impact, the partial contract termination has created a profound sense \nof uncertainty and demoralization among our professional team, hindering our capacity to \nprovide the zealous advocacy our vulnerable clients deserve.  The funding gap will force \nme to utilize personal financial resources to maintain operations and meet staff payroll \nobligations, something I had to do during the previous February 18, 2025, stop work order.  \nCollectively,  this  disruption  has  significantly  impaired  our  ability  to  provide \ncomprehensive assistance to children navigating the complexities of their immigration \ncases.  \n \n20. This funding loss will have immediate and severe consequences.  Within 15 days, we will \nbe forced to lay off half our staff, and within 30 days, our representation program will be \ninsolvent.  While we could potentially redirect money from our limited private cases, this \nwould only sustain minimal operations while compromising our overall services.  Even \nwith eventual backpay, we would incur significant financial harm through interest on \nemergency loans, rehiring costs, and damaged client relationships.  Crucially, children face \ngaps in representation during which filing deadlines might expire, permanently affecting \ntheir immigration relief options.  \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 182\n\n(211 of 956), Page 211 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 211 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-19     Filed 03/27/25     Page 7 of 7\n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 25 of March 2025, in Pomona, CA.            \n          \n_______________________________  \nMiguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska \nManaging Attorney/Owner \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano, PC \nUCP Legal Service Provider \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 183\n\n(212 of 956), Page 212 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 212 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a goef  410 of 44\n1  IMMIGRANT DEFENDERS LAW CENTER  AMICA CENTER FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS \nAlvaro M.

Every day, in immigration courts across the country, unaccompanied children stand (or \n3 \nsit, with legs dangling over chairs, or are held in caretakers’ arms) in front of federal immigration \n4 \njudges, across from Department of Homeland Security lawyers, in adversarial removal proceedings.  \n5 \nThousands of other unaccompanied children are not in removal proceedings—but nonetheless must \n6 \nnavigate the country’s complex immigration laws as they attempt to complete complicated and lengthy \n7 \napplications allowing them to seek lawful status in the United States.  These children, including babies \n8 \n9  and toddlers, arrived in the United States without a parent or legal guardian.  The vast majority do not \n10  speak English; the babies do not speak at all.  Most do not have the means to hire a lawyer. \n11 \n2.  In one case, a one-year-old named Johan appeared in the Phoenix Immigration Court in \n12 \n2018 with a bottle of milk and a purple ball—but without a parent or legal guardian.  The judge in \n13 \nJohan’s case was “embarrassed to ask” if Johan understood the proceedings.  Turning to Johan’s \n14 \nattorney, the judge addressed the absurdity of the legal theater playing out in his courtroom:  “I don’t \n15 \nknow who you would explain it to, unless you think that a 1-year-old could learn immigration law.”  \n16 \n17  Sasha  Ingber,  1-Year-Old  Shows  Up  In  Immigration  Court,  NPR  (July  8,  2018), \n18 \nhttps://perma.cc/ALU7-RM6V.  Johan’s story is not unusual, and demonstrates that the only way that \n19 \nmany unaccompanied children can navigate the immigration legal system is with the help of a lawyer. \n20 \n3.  Each unaccompanied child has their own individual story, but there are common themes.  \n21 \nWhile many unaccompanied children are from Central America and the “Northern Triangle” countries \n22 \nof Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, unaccompanied children come from all over the world.  \n23 \n24  Most speak Spanish; some only speak indigenous Central American languages.  Few speak much \n25  English.  Many fled their home countries for their personal safety, escaping from gang violence, sexual \n26 \nviolence, political violence, extreme poverty, and other dangers, only to experience further violence \n27 \n28 \n4 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 187\n\n(216 of 956), Page 216 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 216 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 5 of 40\n \n \n1  and even trafficking during their long and dangerous journeys north to the United States.  No matter \n2 \ntheir country of origin or spoken language, all are incredibly vulnerable. \n3 \n4.  Recognizing the needs of these children who are attempting to navigate the complex \n4 \nimmigration  system  on  their  own,  Congress  enacted  laws  to  provide  special  protections  for \n5 \nunaccompanied children in that system.  These include the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims \n6 \nProtection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), which requires that the government “shall ensure, \n7 \n8  to the greatest extent practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent \n9  them in “legal proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  \n10 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079. \n11 \n5.  More recently, the Department of Health and Human Services’ (“HHS”) Office of \n12 \nRefugee Resettlement (“ORR”) issued a Foundational Rule, published in 2024, meant, in part, to carry \n13 \nout the agency’s obligations under the TVPRA as well as the earlier 1997 settlement in Flores v. Reno \n14 \n(which dictates certain government obligations to unaccompanied children).  Unaccompanied Children \n15 \n16  Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384 (Apr. 30, 2024) (codified at 45 C.F.R. pt. 410 (the \n17 \n“Foundational  Rule”)).    The  Foundational  Rule  requires  the  government  to  “fund  legal  service \n18 \nproviders to provide direct immigration legal representation” to unaccompanied children if there are \n19 \n“available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal orientation, consultation with a lawyer, \n20 \nand ongoing access to lawyers.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a) (2024). \n21 \n6.  Congress has appropriated funds to ensure as many unaccompanied children as possible \n22 \n23  are represented by lawyers.  For fiscal year 2024, for example, Congress appropriated more than $5 \n24  billion  for  Defendants  to  deliver  services  to  unaccompanied  children  under  various  statutory \n25 \nobligations, which includes funding to provide legal representation for unaccompanied children under \n26 \nthe TVPRA “to the greatest extent practicable.”  This appropriation is now available to fund legal \n27 \nrepresentations through September 30, 2027. \n28 \n5 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 188\n\n(217 of 956), Page 217 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 217 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 6a goef  460 of 44\n \n \n1  7.  For  more  than  a  decade,  until  March  21,  2025—under  different  presidential \n2 \nadministrations and changing immigration policies—the government fulfilled its obligations under the \n3 \nTVPRA and ongoing congressional appropriations to fund legal representation for unaccompanied \n4 \nchildren.  Through this funding, every unaccompanied child in government custody (at shelters run by \n5 \nORR, under the authority of HHS) had the opportunity to receive a group “know your rights” session \n6 \nand an individual legal screening, and many children received direct legal representation from legal \n7 \n8  service  providers.    These  representations  helped  bridge  the  significant  gap  in  legal  access  for \n9  unaccompanied children, only a small number of whom can afford paid representation or are able to \n10 \nindependently retain a pro bono attorney.  They also helped immigration courts function efficiently and \n11 \navoided forcing immigration judges and government lawyers to engage directly with children in \n12 \nresponding to immigration charges and related questions around relief from removal. \n13 \n8.  Plaintiffs are legal service providers that, until March 21, 2025, provided representation \n14 \nand related services to unaccompanied children with funding from Defendants.  Plaintiffs furthered the \n15 \n16  TVPRA’s goals and the requirements in the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule by providing basic \n17 \nlegal services to unaccompanied children and by representing unaccompanied children in immigration \n18 \ncourt, affirmative immigration proceedings, and related state court proceedings.   \n19 \n9.  Now, Plaintiffs have largely had to stop taking on new clients and face the real threat of \n20 \nnot  being  able  to  continue  their  ongoing  representations.    For  example,  without  funding  from \n21 \nDefendants, Plaintiff Community Legal Service in East Palo Alto has had to stop taking on new \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children clients—even if the children face upcoming court dates without a lawyer—\n24  and if it cannot find other funding sources, its ability to represent existing clients (taken on in reliance \n25 \non continued funding from Defendants) will be in jeopardy.  Plaintiffs’ inability to serve new clients \n26 \nor provide certainty for existing clients is an enormous harm to their mission to serve as many \n27 \nunaccompanied children as possible. \n28 \n6 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 189\n\n(218 of 956), Page 218 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 218 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 7a goef  470 of 44\n \n \n1  10.  Plaintiffs’ clients range in age from infants to teenagers, all of whom depend on \n2 \nPlaintiffs for critical legal counsel.  For example, Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center represents \n3 \na 16-year-old girl and her one-year-old son in cases that were funded by Defendants until March 21, \n4 \n2025.  Beginning at the age of six years old, the girl was sex trafficked by her family in Mexico.  After \n5 \ngiving birth to her son, she fled to the U.S. to save him from the same fate. \n6 \n11.  On March 21, 2025, without warning, Defendant the U.S. Department of the Interior \n7 \n8  (“DOI”) sent a notice terminating the contract line items through which Defendants HHS and ORR had \n9  provided funding for counsel for unaccompanied children and ordering Plaintiffs to “immediately stop \n10 \nwork” on their ongoing funded representations (the “Cancellation Order”).  Defendants issued this \n11 \norder despite the TVPRA’s mandate that the government provide unaccompanied children with legal \n12 \ncounsel to the greatest extent practicable and despite the existence of congressionally appropriated \n13 \nfunds to pay for precisely these services through at least September 30, 2027.  As a result, many of the \n14 \napproximately 26,000 unaccompanied children around the country represented by attorneys through \n15 \n16  now-terminated  funding  from  Defendants—including  children  with  immigration  court  hearings \n17 \nscheduled for the following business day—were placed at imminent risk of being cut off from their \n18 \nlawyers.  The children subject to this risk include many children now facing imminent removal from \n19 \nthe United States despite being prima facie eligible for immigration relief. \n20 \n12.  The Cancellation Order flies in the face of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  In \n21 \naddition to interrupting and obstructing attorney-client relationships, contrary to the mandate to provide \n22 \n23  legal counsel to unaccompanied children, it also defeats the broader purpose of both the TVPRA and \n24  the Foundational Rule.  Through the funded representations, Plaintiffs play a key role in identifying \n25 \nand helping child trafficking victims, fulfilling one of Congress’s primary objectives in the TVPRA (to \n26 \n“protect [unaccompanied children] from mistreatment, exploitation and trafficking”).  See TVPRA, \n27 \nPub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), 122 Stat. 5044, 5079 (2008).  By subverting Congress’s funding of \n28 \n7 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 190\n\n(219 of 956), Page 219 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 219 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 8a goef  480 of 44\n \n \n1  counsel for unaccompanied children, Defendants ensure more children will remain separated from their \n2 \nfamilies, fewer trafficking victims will be identified and protected, and more children will be at risk of \n3 \nbeing trafficked in the future.   \n4 \n13.  Defendants’ actions will also cause chaos throughout the immigration legal system and \n5 \nare particularly harmful because they come at a time when the government is reinstating expedited \n6 \ndocketing for removal cases for unaccompanied children.  Unaccompanied children across the country \n7 \n8  have immigration court dates this week, at which some will now appear without an attorney.  Other \n9  children have impending deadlines to apply for immigration relief for which they are eligible, but will \n10 \nneed an attorney’s assistance to submit their application.   \n11 \n14.  As a consequence of Defendants ordering Plaintiffs to stop providing direct legal \n12 \nservices, many unaccompanied children will never speak to a lawyer, will never apply for immigration \n13 \nrelief for which they are eligible, will remain in tenuous status for longer, and will not understand what \n14 \nis happening as they are rushed through adversarial removal proceedings.  Immigration judges will be \n15 \n16  left to carry the burden, on their own, to expend limited government resources to educate child \n17 \nrespondents (some only a few months old) on arcane immigration law and apply the law to their cases, \n18 \nwithout a full understanding of the reasons the children left their countries or the realities facing their \n19 \nremoval.  This will cause immigration judges to spend more time on cases for unaccompanied children \n20 \nat a time when the immigration court backlog is already at an all-time high. \n21 \n15.  Plaintiffs seek to enjoin Defendants from ceasing funding for legal representation of \n22 \n23  unaccompanied  children,  an  action  contrary  to  Congress’s  TVPRA  mandate  and  subsequent \n24  congressional funding, contrary to Defendant ORR’s own Foundational Rule on funding for counsel \n25 \nfor unaccompanied children, and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n26 \n16.  Plaintiffs respectfully ask this Court to grant declaratory and injunctive relief, declaring \n27 \nthat Defendants are violating the law and requiring them to continue funding legal representation \n28 \n8 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 191\n\n(220 of 956), Page 220 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 220 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 9a goef  490 of 44\n \n \n1  consistent with the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule.  Plaintiffs ask this Court to enjoin Defendants \n2 \nnationwide from refusing to fund counsel for unaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and \n3 \nthe Foundational Rule. \n4 \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n5 \n17.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  alleged  in  this  Complaint  under \n6 \n28 U.S.C. § 1331,  as  they  arise  under  federal  law,  including  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act \n7 \n(“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 702, the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n8 \n9  of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and the 2024 Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational \n10  Rule (the “Foundational Rule”), 89 Fed. Reg. 34384. \n11 \n18.  The APA waives the U.S. government’s sovereign immunity where, as here, federal \n12 \nagencies have acted in a manner that is arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in \n13 \nviolation of the law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n14 \n19.  The Court has authority to issue a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment \n15 \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, and Rule 57 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n21.  Venue  properly  lies  in  the  Northern  District  of  California  under  28  U.S.C. \n20 \n§ 1391(e)(1)(C) because Defendants are “officer[s],” “employee[s],” and “agenc[ies],” of the United \n21 \nStates acting in their official capacities, and because Plaintiffs Community Legal Services in East Palo \n22 \nAlto and Social Justice Collaborative are California non-profit organizations headquartered in and \n23 \n24  providing services in the Northern District.  No real property is involved in this action. \n25  22.  Venue is proper in the San Francisco Division because “a substantial part of the events \n26 \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred” in this Division.  28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2).

Plaintiffs \n8 \n23.  Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations that have received funding from Defendants HHS \n9 \n10  and ORR to provide legal representation and other legal services to unaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs \n11  share a mission to expand access to legal information and services for unaccompanied children, and to \n12 \nensure that as many unaccompanied children as possible are represented by a lawyer. \n13 \n24.  Plaintiff Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”) is a nonprofit \n14 \norganization in East Palo Alto, California.  CLSEPA serves unaccompanied children in San Mateo \n15 \nCounty  and  Santa  Clara  County.    Through  funding  from  Defendants,  CLSEPA  provided  legal \n16 \nrepresentation  for  non-detained  unaccompanied  children.    CLSEPA  currently  represents  23 \n17 \n18  unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n19 \n25.  Plaintiff Social Justice Collaborative (“SJC”) is a nonprofit organization in Berkeley, \n20 \nCalifornia, operating across the Bay Area and in California’s central valley—including in areas where \n21 \nit is one of the only organizations offering legal services to immigrants.  It serves unaccompanied \n22 \nchildren  in  San  Francisco  Immigration  Court,  Concord  Immigration  Court,  and  Sacramento \n23 \nImmigration Court.  Through funding from Defendants, SJC provided legal representation to about 45 \n24 \n25  non-detained unaccompanied children per year and hosted Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  \n26 \n27 \n28 \n10 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 193\n\n(222 of 956), Page 222 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 222 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a1g eo f1 410 of 44\n \n \n1  unaccompanied children in the greater Washington, D.C. and Baltimore areas, appearing before the \n2 \nBaltimore,  Hyattsville,  Sterling,  and  Annandale  Immigration  Courts.    Through  funding  from \n3 \nDefendants,  Amica  Center  provided  legal  orientations  for  children  in  ORR  custody,  legal \n4 \nrepresentation for children in ORR custody and released from ORR custody, and hosted an Immigration \n5 \nJustice Corps fellow.  Amica Center currently represents more than 850 unaccompanied children in \n6 \ncases formerly funded by Defendants. \n7 \n8  27.  Plaintiff Estrella del Paso (“Estrella”) is a nonprofit organization based in Texas and the \n9  largest provider of free immigration legal services in West Texas and New Mexico.  It serves \n10 \nunaccompanied children appearing before the El Paso Immigration Court and has provided legal \n11 \nservices for unaccompanied children in El Paso since 2007.  Through funding from Defendants, Estrella \n12 \nprovided legal services to indigent, unaccompanied immigrant children who are not in detention, as \n13 \nwell as those in ORR custody in El Paso County, and conducted “know your rights” presentations and \n14 \nindividual consultations.  Estrella currently represents 324 unaccompanied children in cases formerly \n15 \n16  funded by Defendants. \n17 \n28.  Plaintiff Florence Immigrant and Refugee Rights Project (“Florence Project”) is a \n18 \nnonprofit organization in Arizona.  The Florence Project has provided legal services for unaccompanied \n19 \nchildren in Arizona since 2000.  It serves unaccompanied children in Tucson Immigration Court and \n20 \nPhoenix Immigration Court, and in 24 ORR shelters.  Through funding from Defendants, the Florence \n21 \nProject provided legal orientations, legal representation for detained and non-detained unaccompanied \n22 \n23  children, Spanish-language tutoring, and hosting for Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  The Florence \n24  Project is the only non-profit organization that provides free legal services to unaccompanied children \n25 \nin Arizona and currently represents more than 800 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded \n26 \nby Defendants. \n27 \n28 \n11 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 194\n\n(223 of 956), Page 223 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 223 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a2g eo f1 420 of 44\n \n \n1  29.  Plaintiff  Galveston-Houston  Immigrant  Representation  Project  (“GHIRP”)  is  a \n2 \nnonprofit organization in the Galveston-Houston area of Texas.  It serves unaccompanied children in \n3 \nthe Galveston-Houston area and Houston Immigration Court.  Through funding from Defendants, \n4 \nGHIRP provided legal orientations, legal representation for detained and non-detained unaccompanied \n5 \nchildren,  and  hosting  for  Immigrant  Justice  Corps  fellows.    GHIRP  currently  represents  292 \n6 \nunaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n7 \n8  30.  Plaintiff Immigrant Defenders Law Center (“ImmDef”) is a nonprofit organization in \n9  Los Angeles, California.  It serves unaccompanied children in three Immigration Courts:  Van Nuys, \n10 \nWest Los Angeles, and Santa Ana.  ImmDef provided legal orientations and direct legal representation \n11 \nthrough funding from Defendants for nearly 2,000 detained and non-detained unaccompanied children, \n12 \nalong with Spanish-language tutoring for attorneys, and hosting for Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  \n13 \nImmDef currently represents nearly 2,000 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by \n14 \nDefendants. \n15 \n16  31.  Plaintiff  National  Immigrant  Justice  Center  (“NIJC”)  is  a  nonprofit  organization \n17 \nheadquartered in Chicago, Illinois and has provided services to unaccompanied children for more than \n18 \n40 years.  It serves unaccompanied children in Chicago Immigration Court.  Through funding from \n19 \nDefendants, NIJC provided legal orientations and individual consultations as well as representation to \n20 \nunaccompanied children in immigration proceedings both in and out of ORR custody.  NIJC currently \n21 \nrepresents approximately 500 unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n22 \n23  32.  Plaintiff Northwest Immigrant Rights Project (“NWIRP”) is a nonprofit organization \n24  located in Washington State.  It serves unaccompanied children in Seattle Immigration Court (and \n25 \noccasionally Portland Immigration Court), and has provided free immigration legal services for over \n26 \n40 years.  Through funding from Defendants, NWIRP provided legal services to unaccompanied \n27 \nimmigrant children and youth who have been released from ORR custody throughout Washington \n28 \n12 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 195\n\n(224 of 956), Page 224 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 224 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a3g eo f1 430 of 44\n \n \n1  State.  NWIRP currently represents approximately 500 unaccompanied children in cases formerly \n2 \nfunded by Defendants. \n3 \n33.  Plaintiff Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”) is a nonprofit \n4 \norganization in Colorado.  It serves unaccompanied children in Denver Immigration Court.  Through \n5 \nfunding from Defendants, RMIAN provided legal representation for non-detained unaccompanied \n6 \nchildren and Spanish-language tutoring for staff.  RMIAN is the primary organization providing free \n7 \n8  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  children  in  Colorado.    RMIAN  currently  represents  160 \n9  unaccompanied children in cases formerly funded by Defendants. \n10 \n34.  Plaintiff Vermont Asylum Assistance Project (“VAAP”) is a non-profit organization in \n11 \nVermont.  It serves unaccompanied children in Chelmsford Immigration Court and Boston Immigration \n12 \nCourt.  Through funding from Defendants, VAAP provided legal representation for detained and non-\n13 \ndetained unaccompanied children, and hosting for two Immigrant Justice Corps fellows.  VAAP \n14 \nprovides legal services to about 135 unaccompanied children annually, with 35-40 full scope direct \n15 \n16  representations each year.  Serving unaccompanied children in Vermont is particularly urgent because \n17 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont are often unable to access removal proceedings in far-away \n18 \nBoston and Chelmsford without legal assistance—and VAAP is the only legal services provider for \n19 \nunaccompanied children in Vermont. \n20 \n35.  For  years,  Plaintiffs  heeded  Congress’s  call  to  provide  critical  legal  services  to \n21 \nunaccompanied children.  Plaintiffs collectively represent thousands of unaccompanied children, \n22 \n23  including children in removal proceedings and children applying for affirmative forms of immigration \n24  relief, and their organizational missions and ethical obligations compel them to represent these clients \n25 \nto the best of their abilities.  Defendants’ Cancellation Order severely limits Plaintiffs in performing \n26 \ntheir  respective  missions  to  provide  legal  representation  the  law  requires  be  made  available  to \n27 \nunaccompanied children.  To pay for existing representations, Plaintiffs face the need to use up any \n28 \n13 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 196\n\n(225 of 956), Page 225 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 225 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a4g eo f1 440 of 44\n \n \n1  discretionary or reserve funding, and to lay off employees.  If Plaintiffs are unable to maintain staffing \n2 \nlevels necessary to handle their current caseloads, they will have to assess their ability to meet ongoing \n3 \nethical and court-required obligations to their clients and may be forced to withdraw from ongoing \n4 \ncases.   \n5 \n36.  For many Plaintiffs, these consequences are imminent or already occurring.  For \n6 \nexample, ImmDef has already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff to try to stay financially \n7 \n8  viable and able to serve unaccompanied children for as long as possible.  SJC will have to lay off its \n9  three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows if it cannot find other funding.  To maintain its representations, \n10 \nEstrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 employees in its unaccompanied children program.  VAAP \n11 \nhas had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees and may have to furlough another two \n12 \nemployees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee.  In four weeks, GHIRP will have to lay \n13 \noff most of its 19 employees who provide services to unaccompanied children. \n14 \n15 \nB.  Defendants \n16  37.  Defendant HHS is the department of the federal government that receives appropriations \n17 \nfrom  Congress  to  fulfill  its  statutory  obligations  under  the  TVPRA  to  aid  and  provide  legal \n18 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent practicable.  HHS most recently \n19 \nreceived an appropriation for services (including provision of counsel) required under the TVPRA for \n20 \nunaccompanied children on March 23, 2024, in the 2024 Further Consolidated Appropriations Act.  \n21 \nSee Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub.

HHS And ORR Are Required By Law To Care For Unaccompanied Children. \n10  40.  “Unaccompanied child” is defined by statute as any individual younger than 18 and \n11  without lawful immigration status, who has no parent or legal guardian who is in the United States able \n12 \nto provide care and physical custody.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2).  Once a child is identified as \n13 \nunaccompanied under this definition, they are treated as unaccompanied even if they are later released \n14 \nto  a  sponsor—the  “unaccompanied”  designation  applies  throughout  their  time  navigating  U.S. \n15 \nimmigration law. \n16 \n41.  In the 2024 fiscal year, nearly 100,000 children, toddlers, and babies were identified by \n17 \n18  federal authorities as being unaccompanied children.  These children entered the United States without \n19 \ntheir parents for many reasons, most commonly because they were separated from their parents on their \n20 \nway to the United States, because they were trafficked to the United States, because they were separated \n21 \nfrom their families by immigration authorities after entering the United States, or because they fled \n22 \ntheir home countries without their parents.  A large majority of the children are from Central America \n23 \nand arrived in the United States after a long and dangerous journey north to the U.S.-Mexico border.  \n24 \n25  Many fled unspeakable violence in their home countries and arrived in the United States only to face \n26  detention and deportation on their own.   \n27 \n28 \n15 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 198\n\n(227 of 956), Page 227 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 227 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a6g eo f1 460 of 44\n \n \n1  42.  The United States has long struggled to care for unaccompanied children.  Change has \n2 \ncome as Congress has recognized that unaccompanied children are uniquely vulnerable to trafficking, \n3 \nabuse in government custody, and injustices in the immigration legal system. \n4 \n43.  Until  2002,  the  former  Immigration  and  Naturalization  Services  detained \n5 \nunaccompanied children, treating them similarly to detained noncitizen adults. \n6 \n44.  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 changed this model, giving Defendants HHS and \n7 \n8  ORR legal custody of unaccompanied children, with the mandate to care for these children.  See 6 \n9  U.S.C. § 279(a).   \n10 \n45.  In 2008, the TVPRA imposed further responsibilities on HHS and ORR’s custody of \n11 \nunaccompanied children, including that HHS and ORR “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable \n12 \n. . . that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or \n13 \nmatters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n14 \n15 \nB.  Unaccompanied Children Have Special Legal Rights. \n16  46.  Unaccompanied children have special legal rights, including the right to go through full \n17 \nremoval proceedings before an immigration judge, unlike other individuals who may be put through \n18 \nexpedited removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(5)(D).  If an unaccompanied child applies for \n19 \nasylum, they are entitled to go through the non-adversarial process of an asylum determination through \n20 \nDHS’s Asylum Office—instead of in immigration court, where an immigration judge would preside \n21 \nover an adversarial hearing between a DHS lawyer and the unaccompanied child.  See 8 U.S.C. \n22 \n23  § 1158(b)(3)(C).  Unaccompanied children also have the right to apply for other forms of immigration \n24 \nrelief, like Special Immigrant Juvenile Status, Withholding of Removal, relief under the Convention \n25 \nAgainst Torture, and U or T visas. \n26 \n47.  Although U.S. law guarantees unaccompanied children these rights, the children are not \n27 \nable to avail themselves of these rights unless the children understand their rights, are equipped with \n28 \n16 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 199\n\n(228 of 956), Page 228 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 228 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a7g eo f1 470 of 44\n \n \n1  the tools to exercise them, and are given legal counsel.  For this reason, Congress and ORR have both \n2 \nrecognized the importance of providing unaccompanied children with legal representation—and taken \n3 \nsteps to maximize the number of unaccompanied children represented by attorneys.  The TVPRA \n4 \nrequires Defendants to provide legal representation to unaccompanied children to the greatest extent \n5 \npracticable, and Congress has consistently appropriated funds annually to pay for that representation.   \n6 \n48.  And all children (unaccompanied or otherwise) are protected by regulations that prevent \n7 \n8  immigration judges from accepting an admission of removability from respondents under the age of \n9  18—unless the respondent is represented by an attorney or other designated individual.  See 8 C.F.R. \n10 \n1240.10(c). \n11 \n49.  ORR, recognizing its obligations under the TVPRA, committed to providing legal \n12 \nrepresentation to children unable to secure counsel, subject to ORR’s discretion to the extent it \n13 \ndetermines  appropriations  are  available.    ORR  “strives  for  100  percent  legal  representation  of \n14 \nunaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34526 (Apr. 30, 2024). \n15 \n16 \nC.  The TVPRA Requires Defendants to Provide Legal Services to Unaccompanied Children. \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n51.  Acting on this congressional command, ORR contracted with the Vera Institute for \n22 \n23  Justice in 2005 to administer what was then called the “Unaccompanied Children Pro Bono Project” \n24 \n(the “Project”).  The Project was a three-year pilot to develop and test ways to meet the legal needs of \n25 \nunaccompanied children through pro bono legal services.   \n26 \n52.  Through the Project, ORR and Vera collaborated to design a program of subcontracting \n27 \nwith nonprofit legal service organizations to provide basic legal orientation to unaccompanied children, \n28 \n17 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 200\n\n(229 of 956), Page 229 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 229 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 1a8g eo f1 480 of 44\n \n \n1  to screen their cases to identify those with potential claims for relief from removal, and to recruit and \n2 \ntrain volunteer lawyers to represent children in immigration court.  Initially, the nonprofit legal service \n3 \nproviders were not permitted to use government funding to provide direct representation. \n4 \n53.  At the end of the pilot period in 2008, Vera issued a report to ORR, explaining that \n5 \nvolunteer  attorneys  alone  could  not  represent  all  unaccompanied  children  in  ORR  custody.  \n6 \nAccordingly, the government could not meet its goal of ensuring that a significant percentage of \n7 \n8  unaccompanied children were represented unless it funded attorneys to represent them. \n9  54.  On the heels of this pilot program, Congress imposed additional mandates on ORR and \n10 \nHHS  in  the  William  Wilberforce  Trafficking  Victims  Protection  Reauthorization  Act  of  2008 \n11 \n(“TVPRA”).  The TVPRA mandates HHS to provide counsel for unaccompanied children: \n12 \nThe Secretary of Health and Human Services shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n13 \npracticable and consistent with section 292 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \nU.S.C. 1362), that all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in the \n14 \ncustody of the Secretary or the Secretary of Homeland Security, and who are not \n15  described in subsection (a)(2)(A), have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings \nor matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking. To the \n16  greatest extent practicable, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall make every \neffort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to \n17 \nsuch children without charge. \n18 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added). \n19 \n55.  In other words, the TVPRA directs that Defendants “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n20 \npracticable . . .” that unaccompanied children have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings.  If \n21 \nDefendants have funding they can spend to provide counsel for unaccompanied children, they must \n22 \nspend that funding to provide such counsel. \n23 \n24 \nD.

In  2009,  the  House  Appropriations \n25 \nCommittee—following the passage of the TVPRA—explained that “legal representation is absolutely \n26 \ncritical to ensure that children understand their rights as they navigate the legal process to determine \n27 \ntheir status in the United States.”  H. Rep. 111-220, at 165.  The Committee commended the earlier \n28 \n19 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 202\n\n(231 of 956), Page 231 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 231 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a0g eo f2 400 of 44\n \n \n1  pilot program for legal representation for unaccompanied children and included funding “to continue \n2 \nand expand this initiative” “to work towards ensuring that all unaccompanied alien children understand \n3 \ntheir legal rights and have access to pro bono representation.”  Id. at 165-66.  But success of this \n4 \nprogram to match unaccompanied children with volunteer attorneys was highly dependent on local \n5 \ncircumstances, and it was clear pro bono representation alone could not meet the representational needs \n6 \nof unaccompanied children. \n7 \n8  58.  Beginning in 2012, funding became available to pay lawyers dedicated to representing \n9  unaccompanied children, in addition to referring them to pro bono counsel.   \n10 \n59.  Over time, ORR and Congress have directed that funded representation be expanded \n11 \nagain and again.  In reports accompanying appropriations bills, Congress has built on its mandates for \n12 \nfunded legal representation for unaccompanied children over the years.  For example, in 2018 the \n13 \nSenate Appropriations Committee noted “that services provided by qualified and independent legal \n14 \ncounsel to [unaccompanied children] can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of immigration \n15 \n16  proceedings and significantly reduce the failure-to-appear rate of children who are released from HHS \n17 \ncustody. The Committee recommendation directs ORR to continue the scope and funding of these legal \n18 \nservices at no less than fiscal year 2017 levels.”  S. Rep. 115-289, at 150.  \n19 \n60.  In  2019,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  directed  funding  specifically  for \n20 \n“qualified and independent legal services for unaccompanied children, including but not limited to \n21 \nknow-your- rights orientations, legal screenings, court preparation and assistance, representation, and \n22 \n23  pro bono referrals” and recommended expanding funded representations.  H. Rep. 116-62 at 145 \n24  (emphasis added).   \n25 \n61.  In 2020, the House Appropriations Committee recommended “no less than $30,000,000 \n26 \nto be spent in fiscal year 2021 for direct representation services to children” and encouraged “ORR \n27 \n28 \n20 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 203\n\n(232 of 956), Page 232 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 232 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a1g eo f2 410 of 44\n \n \n1  to work with legal service providers to develop a strategy to minimize the risks of any child having to \n2 \ngo to immigration court without independent legal counsel.”  H. Rep. 116-450 at 180 (emphasis added).   \n3 \n62.  In 2021, the House Appropriations Committee again supported funded representations, \n4 \ninstructing that there should be even more funded representation for unaccompanied children released \n5 \nfrom ORR custody and that such direct representation “shall be made available to children up to the \n6 \nfunded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-96, at 211 (emphasis added). \n7 \n8  63.  In  2022,  the  House  Appropriations  Committee  again  supported  “the  continued \n9  expansion  of  independent  legal  services  for  unaccompanied  children”  and  directed  that  funded \n10 \nrepresentations should “be made available to children up to funded capacity.”  H. Rep. 117-403, at \n11 \n200 (emphasis added). \n12 \n64.  Until March 21, 2025, the Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”) managed a network of \n13 \n89 legal services organizations (including Plaintiffs) in 159 offices across the country providing \n14 \nrepresentation to unaccompanied children through funding from HHS and ORR, under a contract \n15 \n16  between Acacia and DOI (contracting on behalf of HHS and ORR). \n17 \n65.  This contract had four funded line items: \n18 \n1.  Work in ORR shelter facilities, including “know your rights” presentations, intakes to \n19 \nconnect detained children with attorneys, and initial screenings with detained children; \n20 \n2.  Full legal representation for children in and out of ORR custody, as well as other non-\n21 \nrepresentation services such as “friend of court” services in hearings for unaccompanied \n22 \n23  children appearing in immigration court or preparing forms without attorneys; \n24  3.

As of March 21, 2025, Plaintiffs and other attorneys across the country represented \n2 \napproximately 26,000 children, toddlers, and babies—who arrived in the U.S. without parents or other \n3 \ncaregivers—through funding appropriated by Congress and delivered under this contract. \n4 \nE.  Past  Government  Statements  Acknowledge  The  Benefits  Of  Funding  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children and Babies \n6 \n67.  The importance of legal representation for unaccompanied children is borne out in \n7 \nimmigration court statistics.  Increasing representation for unaccompanied children makes immigration \n8 \ncourts run more efficiently, leads to more unaccompanied children who qualify for immigration relief \n9 \nreceiving that relief, and leads to more unaccompanied children without a case for relief requesting \n10 \n11  voluntary departure instead of unnecessary proceedings. \n12  68.  Unrepresented  children  effectively  never  receive  relief  from  removal.    A  2024 \n13 \nCongressional Research Service report explained that from 2005 to 2017, 90% of unaccompanied \n14 \nchildren in removal proceedings without a lawyer were removed and less than 1% received some form \n15 \nof immigration relief (only 308 children out of nearly 90,000).  See “Unaccompanied Alien Children: \n16 \nAn Overview,” CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE (Sept. 5, 2024), https://www.congress.gov/crs-\n17 \nproduct/R43599.  On the other hand, only 21% of represented unaccompanied children received a \n18 \n19  removal order over the same time period, and 73% attain some form of relief, including asylum and \n20 \nother paths to lawful permanent resident status.  Moreover, a greater percentage of unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren with attorneys chose to depart the country voluntarily than those without lawyers, showing the \n22 \nrole attorneys play in helping children understand both their options and—in some circumstances—\n23 \ntheir lack of options. \n24 \n69.  Represented children are also more likely to attend their hearings than unrepresented \n25 \n26  children, and more likely to understand what happens in their cases, easing the burden on immigration \n27  judges to explain proceedings.  From 2005 to 2017, 76% of all unaccompanied children continued to \n28 \nappear as scheduled for their cases—but for represented unaccompanied children, that rate was a near-\n22 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 205\n\n(234 of 956), Page 234 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 234 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a3g eo f2 430 of 44\n \n \n1  perfect 97%.

ORR has acknowledged “that most unaccompanied children need legal services to \n5 \nresolve their immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both \n6 \nthe court appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  Unaccompanied \n7 \n8  Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed.

Immigration Judges And Other Government Officials Regularly Praise Plaintiffs’ Work, \n11  Which Makes Their Jobs Easier \n12  71.  In the past weeks, immigration judges have expressed their concern that Plaintiffs might \n13 \nno longer be working in their courtrooms and helping courts function smoothly.  Plaintiff Community \n14 \nLegal Services in East Palo Alto prioritizes positive interactions with immigration judges and adopts a \n15 \nproactive approach to advocacy, working with ICE counsel to ensure that their clients can advance \n16 \ntheir cases without missing school—a benefit to everyone involved. \n17 \n72.  A judge in Chicago Immigration Court specifically expressed her concern that NIJC \n18 \n19  might not be available anymore to represent unaccompanied children appearing before her.  Judges \n20 \npraise NIJC’s work as allowing the court to operate efficiently and with confidence that unaccompanied \n21 \nchildren are making informed decisions and have been screened for relief and other needs. \n22 \n73.  Plaintiff the Florence Project was created after a call to action by an immigration judge.  \n23 \nThe Florence Project works with the court and individual judges to coordinate the specialized docket \n24 \nfor unaccompanied children, serving as friend of the court frequently.  Judges show their appreciation \n25 \n26  for the Florence Project’s work by giving its staff space in courtrooms to conduct pre-hearing \n27  orientations for children and even by swearing in Florence Project staff who have just been admitted \n28 \n23 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 206\n\n(235 of 956), Page 235 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 235 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-20     Filed 03/27/25     Page 24 of 44\n \n \n1  to the Arizona Bar.  In stakeholder meetings with the government, government partners routinely thank \n2 \nthe Florence Project for its work and emphasize the value of the services it provides. \n3 \n74.  Immigration  judges  and  other  stakeholders  rely  on  Amica  Center’s  services.  \n4 \nImmigration judges rely on Amica Center’s friend of court services and ask Amica Center to enter \n5 \nappearances in cases where the judge doubts the child understands their legal options or is competent \n6 \nto appear in court.  ORR shelter staff lean on Amica Center to answer questions about court appearances \n7 \n8  for the children they house. \n9  75.  Immigration judges overseeing dedicated dockets for unaccompanied children in El \n10 \nPaso express gratitude for the work Estrella does both in its representations and its friend of court \n11 \nservices.  Judges appreciate that Estrella helps them reduce their docket loads.  ORR shelter staff \n12 \nappreciate Estrella’s help and training in caring for unaccompanied children. \n13 \n76.  Immigration judges and government attorneys regularly thank RMIAN for its work, and \n14 \nRMIAN and government employees work together to improve immigration court efficiency in Denver.  \n15 \n16  RMIAN saves the court and the government unnecessary time and effort by obtaining dismissal in \n17 \ncases where dismissal is proper and by avoiding unnecessary status hearings.  The Denver Immigration \n18 \nCourt regularly asks RMIAN to provide friend of court services to assist unaccompanied children with \n19 \nanything from a change of address form to a screening for potential human trafficking.   \n20 \n77.  Judges, clerks, and other immigration court staff, and DHS field office staff praise \n21 \nVAAP’s work as making the immigration legal system more fair and efficient.  VAAP’s services help \n22 \n23  immigration courts avoid unnecessary proceedings and help unaccompanied children efficiently appear \n24  in court remotely. \n25 \nG.  In  2024,  ORR  Issued  A  Foundational  Rule  On  Funding  For  Legal  Services  For \n26  Unaccompanied Children \n27  78.  On  April  30,  2024,  ORR  issued  a  final  rule  following  full  notice-and-comment \n28 \nrulemaking:  the “Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule,” which took effect July 1, \n24 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 207\n\n(236 of 956), Page 236 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 236 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 25 of 40\n \n \n1  2024.  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529 (April 30, \n2 \n2024) (to be codified at 4 C.F.R. pt. 410).  The rule is meant to codify regulations “consistent with \n3 \nORR’s statutory duties” and “responsibilities for coordinating and implement the care and placement \n4 \nof unaccompanied children . . . under the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) and the [TVPRA].”  \n5 \nId., 89 CFR 34384.   \n6 \n79.  Section 410.1309 of the Foundational Rule is titled “Legal Services.”  Id., 89 Fed. Reg. \n7 \n8  34526.  This section of the Foundational Rule affirms ORR’s belief that “legal services providers who \n9  represent unaccompanied children undertake an important function” and stated, “ORR strives for 100 \n10 \npercent legal representation of unaccompanied children and will continue to work towards that goal to \n11 \nthe extent possible.”  Id.   \n12 \n80.  The Foundational Rule requires that unaccompanied children in ORR custody must \n13 \nreceive a legal orientation from “an independent legal service provider” and a “confidential legal \n14 \nconsultation with a qualified attorney.”  Id., 89 CFR 34603.   \n15 \n16  81.  The rule also provides that ORR must—if it has available appropriations—“fund legal \n17 \nservice  providers  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain  unaccompanied \n18 \nchildren.”  Id.   \n19 \n82.  To comply with the TVPRA and INA, the rule recognizes ORR must “ensure that all \n20 \nunaccompanied children who are or have been in ORR care have access to counsel” and provides, \n21 \n“ORR may make grants, in its discretion and subject to available resources . . . or contracts under this \n22 \n23  section . . . for the purpose of providing immigration legal representation, assistance and related \n24  services to unaccompanied children.”  Id.   \n25 \nH.  In  2024,  Congress  Reauthorized  Funding  For  The  Services,  And  That  Funding  Is \n26  Available Today  \n27  83.  On  March  23,  2024,  Congress  passed  H.R.  2882,  the  Further  Consolidated \n28 \nAppropriations Act of 2024, which appropriated funding for many federal departments and programs, \n25 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 208\n\n(237 of 956), Page 237 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 237 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a6g eo f2 460 of 44\n \n \n1  including Defendants HHS and ORR.  Congress specifically appropriated funds “for carrying out . . . \n2 \nsection 235 of the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008,” \n3 \nthe TVPRA.  Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664.  Section 235 of the TVPRA includes the requirement \n4 \nto provide funding for counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable”—so the \n5 \nappropriation was, in part, meant to pay for this representation.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n6 \n84.  The Senate Report accompanying the 2024 appropriations bill commanded Defendant \n7 \n8  HHS to fund the Services.  The Senate Committee on Appropriations specified there should be \n9  “$5,506,258,000 for the Unaccompanied Children [UC] program.”  S. Rep. 118-84, at 167.  It went on \n10 \nto direct, “The Committee recommendation includes no less than the fiscal year 2023 funding level for \n11 \npost-release services; legal services and access to counsel; and child advocates.  The Committee \n12 \nexpects HHS will continue to expand child-welfare focused post-release services . . . including . . . \n13 \naccess to legal services.”  Id. at 168. \n14 \n85.  The Senate Report expressed its understanding that the TVPRA requires ORR to fund \n15 \n16  counsel for unaccompanied children:  “The Committee also expects these funds will be used to provide \n17 \naccess to counsel, consistent with the goals of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act \n18 \nof 2008 for all children to have access to counsel in their immigration proceedings.”  Id. at 169 \n19 \n(emphasis added). \n20 \n86.  On March 15, 2025, Congress continued funding at the levels set in the Further \n21 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act.  Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \n22 \n23  Pub. L. 119-4, div. A tit. I sec. 1101(8) (2025). \n24  87.  This appropriated funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is now available to \n25 \nDefendants through September 30, 2027.  The initial 2024 appropriation extended for two years, \n26 \nthrough September 30, 2026, Pub. L. 118-47 138 Stat. 460, 664, and the Full-Year Continuing \n27 \nAppropriations and Extensions Act of 2025 further extended the appropriation by another year, Pub. \n28 \n26 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 209\n\n(238 of 956), Page 238 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 238 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 2a7g eo f2 470 of 44\n \n \n1  L. 119-4, div.

Defendants  Abruptly  Shut  Down  And  Later  Resumed  Funding  For  Counsel  For \n5 \nUnaccompanied Children Without Explanation \n6 \n88.  Despite  Congress’s  consistent  funding  of  legal  representation  for  unaccompanied \n7 \nchildren, consistent with the TVPRA, Defendants seek to undermine congressional appropriations and \n8 \nthe TVPRA’s mandate.  On Tuesday, February 18, 2025, without warning, Defendant DOI and \n9 \nDefendant  HHS  issued  a  “Stop  Work  Order”  to  Acacia,  ordering  service  providers—including \n10 \n11  Plaintiffs—to “cease all services” and “stop all work” for those services under the contract between \n12  Acacia and DOI.  The order included no end date; it indefinitely suspended the services.  The stop work \n13 \norder gave no explanation, but said it had nothing to do with how the legal services were being run: \n14 \n“The stop work order is being implemented due to causes outside of [Acacia’s] control and should not \n15 \nbe misconstrued as an indication of poor performance by [Acacia].”  Nevertheless, the order explained, \n16 \nthe stop work order could lead Defendants to “terminate the contract.”    \n17 \n89.  Three  days  later,  and  after  significant  backlash,  on  Friday,  February  21,  2025, \n18 \n19  Defendants voluntarily rescinded the stop work order without explanation.   \n20 \nJ.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators Reminded Defendants That Ending Funding For Counsel \n21  For Unaccompanied Children Violates the TVPRA \n22  90.  On March 3, 2025, 32 Senators wrote to HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and DOI \n23  Secretary Doug Burgum to express their “strong opposition” to the now-rescinded stop work order and \n24 \nto note their “concern[] about the chaos and confusion it caused for legal services providers and the \n25 \nchildren they serve.”  Sens. Ossoff, Hirono, et al, Letter to Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and \n26 \nSecretary  Doug  Burgum  (Mar.  3,  2025),  accessible  at  https://www.hirono.senate.gov/ \n27 \nimo/media/doc/250305lettertohhsandinterioronlegalservicesforchildreninimmigrationsystem.pdf.   \n28 \n27 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 210\n\n(239 of 956), Page 239 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 239 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 7-20     Filed 03/27/25     Page 28 of 44\n \n \n1  91.  The Senators explained that the stop work order—and any other attempt to stop funding \n2 \ncounsel for unaccompanied children—is a violation of the TVPRA: “Pausing or terminating the \n3 \nprovision of legal services to unaccompanied children under this contract runs directly counter \n4 \nto the requirements of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and \n5 \nplaces 26,000 unaccompanied children at increased risk of trafficking, exploitation, and other harm. \n6 \nThe TVPRA, passed by Congress in 2008 on a bipartisan basis, requires the Department of Health and \n7 \n8  Human Services (HHS) to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that all unaccompanied children \n9  have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, \n10 \nand trafficking. Shirking this statutory mandate heightens the risk of harm for these uniquely vulnerable \n11 \nchildren.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n12 \n92.  The  Senators  went  on  to  explain  that  representation  makes  it  more  likely  that \n13 \nunaccompanied children will appear at their hearings, less likely that the government will lose track of \n14 \nunaccompanied children, and less likely that the unaccompanied children will be trafficked.  Id. at  2. \n15 \n16  93.  The Senators requested a briefing from Defendants about why the stop work order was \n17 \nissued and Defendants’ “plan for compliance with your statutory mandate to ensure that children have \n18 \ncounsel in immigration proceedings.”  Id. \n19 \n94.  Plaintiffs are not aware of any response from Defendants to the Senators. \n20 \n21  K.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants Again Stopped Funding Counsel for Unaccompanied \nChildren \n22 \n95.  Although  Defendants  rescinded  their  February  18,  2025  stop  work  order,  they \n23 \napparently continued to look for ways to avoid the TVPRA’s and Foundational Rule’s requirement that \n24 \nthey fund legal representation for unaccompanied children.  On March 21, 2025, Defendant DOI sent \n25 \n26  a letter titled “Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience” to Acacia (the \n27  “Cancellation Order”).  The letter announced that Defendants were terminating funding for contract \n28 \nline items two through four:  legal representation for unaccompanied children—both in and out of \n28 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 211\n\n(240 of 956), Page 240 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 240 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 29 of 40\n \n \n1  detention—and other legal services like “friend of court” assistance in pro se matters, Immigrant \n2 \nJustice Corps fellows, and Spanish-language tutoring.  The letter further commanded Acacia and \n3 \nPlaintiffs to “immediately stop work” on these representations. \n4 \n96.  On information and belief, Defendants have no plans to fund any legal representation \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children—whether by reinstating the cancelled contract line items or by finding \n6 \nalternative ways to pay lawyers to represent unaccompanied children.   \n7 \n8  97.  The Cancellation Order took effect at close of business on Friday, March 21, 2025, and \n9  Plaintiffs represent clients with immigration court hearings that were scheduled for Monday March 24, \n10 \n2025—the very next business day.  Yet Plaintiffs received no guidance from Defendants regarding how \n11 \nthose representations should continue—forcing them to choose between seeking to withdraw from their \n12 \nrepresentations or attempting to continue representing their clients unfunded.  Their clients are at risk \n13 \nof losing access to the legal counsel provided by the TVPRA and Foundational Rule.    \n14 \n15 \nL.  Defendants’ Termination Of Funding To Represent Unaccompanied Children Frustrates \nPlaintiffs’  Missions,  Causes  Plaintiffs  Irreparable  Harm,  and  Serves  No  Legitimate \n16 \nPurpose. \n17 \n98.  Terminating funding for attorneys to represent unaccompanied children has devastating \n18 \nand irreparable effects, even more so for the harm it does to unaccompanied children.  Even if \n19 \nDefendants reinstate funding for counsel for unaccompanied children at some unknown future time (an \n20 \nunlikely supposition), the funded representations, the non-profits and attorneys that administer them, \n21 \nand the unaccompanied children that receive vital counsel from them already will have been dealt an \n22 \n23  irreparable blow.   \n24 \n99.  Defendants’  actions  will  cause  Plaintiffs  to  lay  off  employees  and  lose  huge \n25 \npercentages  of  their  overall  funding.    For  Plaintiffs,  the  funding  Congress  has  consistently \n26 \nappropriated to provide services under the TVPRA is existentially important.   \n27 \n28 \n29 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 212\n\n(241 of 956), Page 241 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 241 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a0g eo f3 400 of 44\n \n \n1  100.  For example, funding for the services Defendants have illegally cancelled makes up \n2 \napproximately 55% of ImmDef’s budget and pays for 113 of ImmDef’s approximately 200 employees.  \n3 \nThe cancelled funding made up nearly half of VAAP’s and GHIRP’s operating budgets, 30% of Amica \n4 \nCenter’s budget, over 25% of NIJC’s budget, 15% of RMIAN’s budget, and 10% of NWIRP’s budget.  \n5 \nThe Florence Project received about $12 million a year from the now-cancelled funding, which \n6 \nsupported more than 100 employees. \n7 \n8  101.  Many organizations will have to lay off staff.  SJC will soon have to lay off its three \n9  Immigrant Justice Corps fellows unless it can find another source of funding for their salaries, ImmDef \n10 \nhas already been forced to give layoff notices to 27 staff, Estrella has had to furlough 18 of the 28 \n11 \nemployees in its unaccompanied children program, GHIRP will have to lay off most of its 19 children’s \n12 \nprogram staff in four weeks, and VAAP has had to not renew the contract of one of its four employees, \n13 \nand may have to furlough another two employees—leaving it with only a single remaining employee. \n14 \n15  102.  Because Plaintiffs’ mission is to serve unaccompanied children, they will incur \n16  huge losses to keep doing so.  Plaintiffs’ ethical responsibilities to their clients and commitment to \n17 \ntheir mission of serving as many unaccompanied children as possible mean that Plaintiffs cannot simply \n18 \ncut off services and representations for unaccompanied children.  The organizations will hold on for as \n19 \nlong as they can without funding from Defendants, but the impacts will be harsh whether they are \n20 \nimmediate or sightly delayed. \n21 \n103.  For  example,  CLSEPA  has  had  to  stop  taking  on  new  clients,  even  if  they  are \n22 \n23  unaccompanied children in removal proceedings without an attorney.  CLSEPA is seeking new funding \n24  to continue existing representations of unaccompanied children, but is faced with the risk of having to \n25 \nwithdraw from ongoing representations—which is entirely antithetical to CLSEPA’s mission to serve \n26 \nimmigrants in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. \n27 \n28 \n30 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 213\n\n(242 of 956), Page 242 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 242 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a1g eo f3 410 of 44\n \n \n1  104.  SJC is facing the prospect of having to lay off three Immigrant Justice Corps fellows \n2 \nwho represent unaccompanied children and may be forced to try to find other organizations that can \n3 \ntake on their clients. \n4 \n105.  Estrella faces a budget deficit of more than $200,000 per month to maintain its services \n5 \nfor unaccompanied children without funding from Defendants.  To continue representing the 324 \n6 \nunaccompanied children clients it took on in reliance on funding from Defendants, Estrella will have \n7 \n8  to operate at this significant deficit, threatening Estrella’s other programming.  Once Estrella’s reserves \n9  are depleted, it will likely not be able to offer free legal representation in many circumstances. \n10 \n106.  The  Florence  Project  is  drawing  on  general  funds  to  sustain  its  services  for \n11 \nunaccompanied children but will likely have to conduct significant layoffs of its team of more than 100 \n12 \nemployees who are dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Still, the Florence Project is \n13 \ndetermined to continue its representations of more than 800 unaccompanied children—even without \n14 \nthe funding it relied on when it entered into the representations—though it will cost the organization \n15 \n16  significantly to continue this work. \n17 \n107.  To support their existing Immigrant Children and Youth staff, GHIRP will have to rely \n18 \non  unrestricted  funds  and  savings,  destabilizing  the  organization  as  a  whole.  This  will  divert \n19 \nunrestricted funds away from other services, as these resources typically cover gaps in funding between \n20 \ncontract cycles on other grants, underfunded programs, or new initiatives that are responsive to \n21 \nemerging needs in their community. \n22 \n23  108.  ImmDef has 1,900 cases that were funded by Defendants.  ImmDef estimates its reserve \n24  funding will be exhausted within 6 months, and to hang on that long it will have to dramatically cut its \n25 \nstaffing.  Just to position itself to survive in the short-term, ImmDef has had to lay off 27 staff.  Once \n26 \nImmDef’s  reserves  run  out,  it  will  have  to  terminate  all  113  staff  formerly  funded  by  money \n27 \nappropriated by Congress to provide services under the TVPRA.  As ImmDef has to cut staff, it will \n28 \n31 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 214\n\n(243 of 956), Page 243 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 243 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a2g eo f3 420 of 44\n \n \n1  be unable to reallocate its 1,900 formerly funded cases to other attorneys—so it will be unable to \n2 \ncompetently represent existing unaccompanied child clients. \n3 \n109.  NWIRP will have to spend at least $200,000 per month to sustain its services for \n4 \nunaccompanied children that were previously funded by Defendants. \n5 \n110.  NIJC is transferring employees away from its children’s services to try to make it \n6 \nfeasible to maintain a limited staff to attempt to sustain existing representations. \n7 \n8  111.  RMIAN will have to draw from its financial reserves and the limited funding it receives \n9  that is not pre-allocated for restricted purposes to delay layoffs, and it cannot provide long-term \n10 \nassurances to its clients that they will not be left without lawyers if RMIAN cannot afford to keep its \n11 \nunaccompanied children staff employed. \n12 \n112.  VAAP’s remaining staff of three are stretched as they try to continue to support their \n13 \nclients.  Two of those three may soon need to be furloughed, leaving only one attorney for all of \n14 \nVAAP’s clients. \n15 \n16  113.  Every harm to their clients is a severe harm to Plaintiffs’ mission to help their \n17 \nclients.  Plaintiffs’ clients are significantly harmed by the uncertainty they now face, as Plaintiffs may \n18 \nbe forced to withdraw from ongoing representations.  The cases Plaintiffs took on in reliance on funding \n19 \nfrom Defendants are complex and often take years to resolve, and clients will be harmed if they are no \n20 \nlonger represented by Plaintiffs.   \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n32 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 215\n\n(244 of 956), Page 244 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 244 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a3g eo f3 430 of 44\n \n \n1  attorneys remaining on staff to represent him at his interview when it is scheduled, and ImmDef is \n2 \nhelpless to provide him any assurances. \n3 \n115.  In representations formerly funded by Defendants, SJC represents—for example—three \n4 \nindividuals not in active removal proceedings, with strong cases for affirmative immigration relief that \n5 \nwould allow them to stay in the country.  None of these clients could afford to hire a lawyer, but with \n6 \nfree representation from SJC each has a clear path to relief.  If SJC cannot continue to represent them, \n7 \n8  they will be unlikely to secure the relief they qualify for. \n9  116.  The Amica Center represents a four-year-old boy from Haiti in a case formerly funded \n10 \nby Defendants.  The four-year-old has a hearing in the process of obtaining SIJS relief on April 2, 2025.  \n11 \nHe also has an immigration court hearing in early June.  Without an attorney, the four-year-old could \n12 \nnot engage in these proceedings or obtain any of the immigration relief for which he is eligible.  The \n13 \nAmica Center is continuing to represent him and its other unaccompanied child clients, though \n14 \ncontinuing its now-unfunded representations is very costly to the organization. \n15 \n16  117.  The Florence Project currently represents a set of three siblings who fled their home \n17 \ncountry after their mother died and their sister was murdered.  All three siblings have pending asylum \n18 \napplications and are in the process of obtaining SIJS relief.  Both the asylum and SIJS processes require \n19 \ncomplex legal work, and the siblings would have little hope of obtaining relief without an attorney.  \n20 \nWere the three to lose their Florence Project lawyer—previously funded by Defendants—they would \n21 \nbe severely harmed, a result antithetical to the Florence Project’s mission. \n22 \n23  118.  Defendants’ illegal actions prevent Plaintiffs pursuing their missions.  Because \n24  Plaintiffs’ missions are founded on the belief that no child should face a trained government prosecutor \n25 \nalone,  Plaintiffs  also  suffer  significant  harms  to  their  missions  because  without  funding  from \n26 \nDefendants, they cannot take on new clients.  Every unaccompanied child in ORR custody who needs \n27 \nbut does not receive representation because Defendants have ceased funding legal representation under \n28 \n33 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 216\n\n(245 of 956), Page 245 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 245 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a4g eo f3 440 of 44\n \n \n1  the TVPRA is a harm to Plaintiffs, as organizations that exist to serve these children and to ensure as \n2 \nfew as possible go without a lawyer.  Unrepresented children will be unable to apply for voluntary \n3 \ndeparture to return home, children who have been trafficked will be unable to access the protections \n4 \nafforded to them by U.S. law, and children with strong cases for asylum who fled persecution in their \n5 \nhome countries will be unable to apply for asylum.  These impacts are unacceptable for Plaintiffs. \n6 \n119.  If Plaintiffs are forced to shut down or stop providing services to unaccompanied \n7 \n8  children entirely, these mission harms will be even more acute because entire populations will be left \n9  unserved.  For example, SJC serves remote areas of California’s central valley where there are few \n10 \nother  resources  for  unaccompanied  children,  VAAP  is  the  only  legal  service  provider  for \n11 \nunaccompanied  children  in  Vermont,  RMIAN  is  the  primary  free  legal  service  provider  for \n12 \nunaccompanied children in Colorado, and for the majority of unaccompanied children in ORR custody \n13 \nin Arizona, the Florence Project represents their only access to counsel and only opportunity to receive \n14 \nfree legal representation. \n15 \n16  120.  Defendants’ illegal actions are also causing collateral harm to other parts of \n17 \nPlaintiffs’ missions.  While work serving unaccompanied children is a large portion of what most \n18 \nPlaintiffs do, many Plaintiffs also serve other immigrant populations—but Defendants’ illegal refusal \n19 \nto fund legal representation has knock-on effects that harm all of Plaintiffs’ efforts and other missions. \n20 \n121.  The Florence Project has had to institute a hiring freeze and cannot fill twenty open \n21 \npositions that would be dedicated to serving unaccompanied children.  Because the Florence Project is \n22 \n23  having to use general funding to maintain its representations of unaccompanied children, it has also \n24  had to freeze hirings in all non-unaccompanied-children service areas across the organization, limiting \n25 \nits ability to carry out other elements of its mission to provide legal services to immigrants. \n26 \n27 \n28 \n34 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 217\n\n(246 of 956), Page 246 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 246 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847     Document 1     Filed 03/26/25     Page 35 of 40\n \n \n1  122.  As GHIRP draws down its savings to continue serving its unaccompanied child clients, \n2 \nthe financial strain threatens its other programming, which also relies on GHIRP maintaining funds to \n3 \ncover gaps in funding for those other programs. \n4 \n123.  For ImmDef, transferring funds from other efforts to try to sustain legal representations \n5 \nof unaccompanied children for as long as possible will mean cutting back on other services it planned \n6 \nto provide for immigrants, including pro se clinics.  ImmDef has also had to stop providing any non-\n7 \n8  essential support for its clients (like paying for medical exams required for certain adjustment of status \n9  applications), though its mission is to support its clients as much as possible.  And ImmDef has had to \n10 \nfreeze all hiring across its organization, hampering its ability to fulfill its overall mission of providing \n11 \nlegal services to immigrants. \n12 \n124.  NWIRP is being forced to draw from its reserves, at the expense of using that money \n13 \nfor the other services it provides immigrants in Washington state. \n14 \n125.  RMIAN will be forced to dedicate its already-limited staff time to fundraise to try to \n15 \n16  cover the gap left by the cancelled funding.  RMIAN is concerned that its staff might take other jobs \n17 \nwith organizations that are more securely funded. \n18 \n126.  Because VAAP is a small organization, its remaining staff of three has struggled to keep \n19 \nup its legal work and field client questions, and has been unable to engage in basic administrative work \n20 \nto keep the organization running. \n21 \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n22 \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n23  Not in Accordance with Law \n24  127.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n25  herein.  \n26 \n128.  The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) authorizes this Court to set aside agency \n27 \naction that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \n28 \n35 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 218\n\n(247 of 956), Page 247 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 247 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a6g eo f3 460 of 44\n \n \n1  U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ cancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied \n2 \nchildren violates the TVPRA. \n3 \n129.  The TVPRA requires Defendants HHS and ORR to “ensure, to the greatest extent \n4 \npracticable . . . that all unaccompanied . . . children who are or have been in the custody of [Defendants \n5 \nHHS and ORR] . . . have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them \n6 \nfrom mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  This language in the TVPRA \n7 \n8  is and has been understood to require Defendants HHS and ORR to fund attorneys to represent \n9  unaccompanied children.   \n10 \n130.  Congress has consistently and specifically appropriated funds to Defendants HHS and \n11 \nORR to provide services required by the TVPRA, including funding legal representation.  These \n12 \ncongressionally appropriated funds remain available to Defendants to pay for legal representation \n13 \nthrough September 30, 2027.  \n14 \n131.  On March 21, 2025, Defendants terminated the contract line items that funded legal \n15 \n16  representation under the TVPRA.  On information and belief, Defendants are not funding the required \n17 \nlegal representations for unaccompanied children in any other way.  Instead, the Cancellation Order \n18 \nends government-funded legal representation for unaccompanied children despite the availability of \n19 \nappropriated funding for such representations through at least September 30, 2027—two-and-a-half \n20 \nyears from now. \n21 \n132.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n22 \n23  availability of appropriated funds for this purpose, Defendants violate the TVPRA’s mandate to provide \n24  counsel for unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable.”  Funds remain available for \n25 \nthis purpose, and Defendants are subverting congressional appropriations and the TVPRA by failing to \n26 \nfund legal representation for unaccompanied children. \n27 \n28 \n36 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 219\n\n(248 of 956), Page 248 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 248 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a7g eo f3 470 of 44\n \n \n1  133.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children is \n2 \nnot in accordance with the TVPRA, it is “not in accordance with law” within the meaning of the APA \n3 \nand should be set aside. \n4 \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n5  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \nAccardi Doctrine \n6 \n134.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n7 \nherein.  \n8 \n9  135.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n10  an abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Defendants’ \n11 \ncancellation of funding for counsel to represent unaccompanied children violates the APA under the \n12 \nAccardi Doctrine because it violates ORR’s own policies and regulations. \n13 \n136.  Longstanding Supreme Court caselaw mandates that agencies must adhere to their own \n14 \npolicies and regulations, and that failure to do so violates the APA.  See U.S. ex rel. Accardi v. \n15 \nShaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954), superseded by statute on other grounds; see also Alcaraz v. \n16 \n17  I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, 1162 (9th Cir. 2004) (“The legal proposition that agencies may be required to \n18 \nabide by certain internal policies is well-established.”).   \n19 \n137.  The  2024  Unaccompanied  Children  Program  Foundational  Rule  requires  the \n20 \ngovernment to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation” to \n21 \nunaccompanied children if there are “available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a legal \n22 \norientation, consultation with a lawyer, and ongoing access to lawyers.  89 CFR 34604.   \n23 \n24  138.  The ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children Bureau Policy Guide expressly states that \n25  “ORR funds legal service providers (LSPs) to provide direct immigration legal representation or \n26 \nrepresentation in non-immigration related matters to the extent of available appropriations, and insofar \n27 \nas it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  See “ORR Unaccompanied Alien Children \n28 \n37 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 220\n\n(249 of 956), Page 249 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 249 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a8g eo f3 480 of 44\n \n \n1  Bureau Policy Guide: Section 3.7.2 Direct Legal Representation,” OFFICE OF REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT \n2 \n(revised Aug. 1, 2024), https://acf.gov/orr/policy-guidance/unaccompanied-children-program-policy-\n3 \nguide-section-3#3.7.2. \n4 \n139.  By ending funding for legal representation of unaccompanied children despite the \n5 \navailability of appropriated funds for this purpose through at least September 30, 2027, Defendants \n6 \nviolate the Foundational Rule’s mandate to provide counsel for unaccompanied children to the extent \n7 \n8  there are appropriated funds available to do so and violate ORR’s policy of funding legal service \n9  providers “to the extent of available appropriations.”  Defendants’ violations of ORR’s own rule and \n10 \npolicy violate the APA. \n11 \n140.  Because Defendants’ termination of funding for counsel for unaccompanied children \n12 \nviolates the Foundational Rule and ORR’s own Policy Guide, it violates the APA and should be set \n13 \naside under the Accardi Doctrine as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion [and] otherwise not \n14 \nin accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n15 \n16  THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)  \n17 \nArbitrary and Capricious \n18 \n141.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 126 as if fully rewritten \n19 \nherein.  \n20 \n142.  The APA authorizes this Court to set aside agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, \n21 \nan abuse of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n22 \n143.  Defendants  have  given  no  reasoned  justification  for  their  abrupt  cancellation  of \n23 \n24  mandated  and  appropriated  funding  for  legal  representations  for  unaccompanied  children.    The \n25  Cancellation Order gives no reasoning at all.  And the February stop work order expressly disclaimed \n26 \nthat it was issued for any “poor performance” of the legal representations. \n27 \n28 \n38 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 221\n\n(250 of 956), Page 250 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 250 of 956\nCaseC 3a:s2e5 -3c:v2-50-2c8v4-072-A84M7O        D  Docoucmumenetn 1t  7  - 2 F0i l e  d F 0il3e/d2 60/32/52 7  / 2 P5 a  g  eP 3a9g eo f3 490 of 44\n \n \n1  144.  There is significant evidence that providing legal representation improves efficiency in \n2 \nimmigration court and conserves immigration court time and resources.  Cancelling funding for legal \n3 \nrepresentation will only make immigration courts operate less efficiently. \n4 \n145.  In addition, Defendants’ unlawful cancellation of funding for legal representations \n5 \ndirectly  undermines  Plaintiff  organizations’  missions  to  provide  representation  for  as  many \n6 \nunaccompanied children as possible.  Defendants have “entirely failed to consider an important aspect \n7 \n8  of the problem” by failing to consider the impact to Plaintiffs and their clients.  Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \n9  Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983). \n10 \n146.  Because Defendants’ termination of the Programs is arbitrary and capricious, Plaintiffs \n11 \nask that the Court set aside Defendants’ actions as violative of the APA. \n12 \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n13 \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court: \n14 \n1.  Declare  that  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  APA  because  they  are  “arbitrary, \n15 \ncapricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise in violation of the law.” \n16 \n17  2.  Declare  that  Defendants  are  required  to  continue  funding  legal  representation  to \n18 \nunaccompanied children, consistent with the TVPRA and ORR’s Foundational Rule. \n19 \n3.  Set aside Defendants’ actions that violate the APA. \n20 \n4.  Enjoin  Defendants  nationwide  from  ceasing  to  fund  counsel  to  represent \n21 \nunaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule. \n22 \n5.  Award Plaintiffs’ counsel reasonable attorneys’ fees under the Equal Access to Justice \n23 \n24  Act, and any other applicable statute or regulation; and  \n25  6.

INTRODUCTION \n2  The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ extraordinary request for a temporary restraining order and \n3  preliminary  injunction,  ECF  No.  7  (“motion”).  Plaintiffs’  motion  is  legally  unfounded,  factually \n4  overstated, and disregards both the statutory and regulatory discretion Congress expressly conferred upon \n5  the federal government.  The relief they seek would not preserve the status quo, but instead disrupt the \n6  government’s longstanding management of legal services for unaccompanied alien children (“UAC”)—\n7  services that remain subject to available appropriations and the agency’s judgment. \n8  Plaintiffs are legal service providers seeking to compel the United States Department of Health \n9  and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”), to indefinitely fund direct legal \n10  representation for UAC through specific contracting arrangements.  But the governing statute—the \n11  William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), Pub. L. No. 110-457 \n12  (codified  in  principal  part  at  8  U.S.C.  § 1232)—expressly  conditions  any  such  representation  on \n13  practicability and the availability of pro bono counsel.  It does not create an enforceable right to \n14  government-funded representation, let alone compel the agency to maintain any particular scope of \n15  services or contractual relationship.  Similarly, the regulatory language Plaintiffs cite, the Foundational \n16  Rule, codified at 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), confirms that ORR’s obligation to fund direct representation \n17  is contingent on both available appropriations and ORR’s discretionary determinations.  Congress never \n18  mandated indefinite funding for these services, and nothing in the TVPRA or ORR’s Foundational Rule \n19  suggests otherwise.   \n20  As a threshold matter, Plaintiffs seek to convert a discretionary, resource-dependent program into \n21  a judicially enforceable entitlement.  That effort fails as a matter of law.  Plaintiffs lack organizational \n22  standing, cannot show that the termination decision constitutes final agency action reviewable under the \n23  APA and can identify no statutory or regulatory provision that imposes a binding duty on the government \n24  to  maintain  uninterrupted  direct  representation  contracts.    At  most,  Plaintiffs  disagree  with  the \n25  government’s policy judgment to conserve resources and reallocate funding within the broad framework \n26  of the TVPRA—a judgment that courts have repeatedly held is committed to agency discretion. \n27  Regardless, this Court lacks jurisdiction over what is, at bottom, a dispute over the partial \n28  termination of a federal contract. Under the Tucker Act and the Contract Disputes Act, challenges to \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 235\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1 \n \n\n(264 of 956), Page 264 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 264 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 9 of 30\n \n \n \n1  government contract terminations must be brought in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims.  Plaintiffs’ attempt \n2  to recast a contract termination as a violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n3  § 701, et seq., cannot circumvent that exclusive remedial scheme.  Moreover, decisions regarding whether \n4  and how to terminate government contracts—particularly for the government’s convenience—are classic \n5  examples of actions committed to agency discretion and are not subject to judicial review under the APA. \n6  Nor can Plaintiffs establish any of the equitable factors required for injunctive relief.  Their claims \n7  of irreparable harm rest on speculative predictions about staffing decisions and funding shortfalls that are \n8  neither immediate nor irreversible.  Nothing in the record suggests that Plaintiffs are barred from \n9  continuing their work, pursuing other funding sources, or seeking relief through the dispute resolution \n10  provisions of the contract, setting aside the fact that none of the plaintiffs are actually a party to that \n11  agreement. A TRO’s extraordinary relief is not an appropriate mechanism for restructuring federal \n12  contract policy to align with a particular group of stakeholders’ policy preferences, particularly where the \n13  asserted harms are financial and the underlying legal theory is without merit. The Court should therefore \n14  deny Plaintiffs’ motion. \n15  II.  BACKGROUND \n16  A.  Legal Framework \n17  The statutory and regulatory framework governing legal representation for UAC in federal care \n18  and custody reflects a coordinated scheme established by Congress to balance the protection of vulnerable \n19  children with the Executive’s discretion over immigration and programmatic resource allocation.  This \n20  framework primarily originates in two statutes: the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (“HSA”) and the \n21  TVPRA. \n22 \n23  In 2002, Congress enacted the HSA, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (codified in relevant part \n24  at 6 U.S.C. § 279), abolishing the Immigration and Naturalization Service (“INS”) and transferring the \n25  responsibility for the care and placement of UAC from INS to ORR.  6 U.S.C. §§ 279(a), (b)(1)(A), (g)(2). \n26  The HSA defines a UAC as “a child who—(A) has no lawful immigration status in the United \n27  States; (B) has not attained 18 years of age; and (C) with respect to whom— (i) there is no parent or legal \n28  guardian in the United States; or (ii) no parent or legal guardian in the United States is available to provide \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 236\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2 \n \n\n(265 of 956), Page 265 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 265 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 10 of 30\n \n \n \n1  care and physical custody.” 6 U.S.C. § 279(g)(2). Further, it assigns ORR broad authority over the care \n2  and custody of UAC while they are in federal custody due to their immigration status, including \n3  coordinating their care and placement, ensuring their best interests in custodial decisions, and developing \n4  plans to “ensure that qualified and independent legal counsel is timely appointed to represent the interests \n5  of each such child.”  6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(A).  These responsibilities are carried out through cooperative \n6  agreements and contracts with care providers under ORR policies and oversight.  See 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1); \n7  31 U.S.C. § 6305. \n8  2.  The Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (“TVPRA”) \nCongress enacted the TVPRA in 2008 to strengthen protections for UAC and support their safe \n9 \nrepatriation or appropriate placement.  The statute, consistent with the HSA, makes the Secretary of HHS \n10 \nresponsible for the care and custody of UAC.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  The TVPRA explicitly directs HHS \n11 \nto prioritize the utilization of pro bono counsel and does not mandate direct government-funded legal \n12 \nrepresentation: Section 235 of the TVPRA encourages HHS to ensure UAC have counsel “to the greatest \n13 \nextent practicable” and “make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide \n14 \nrepresentation without charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n15 \nFurther, Section 235 encourages HHS to ensure that counsel is available to represent UAC in “legal \n16 \n17  proceedings  or  matters,”  expressly  linking  representation  duties  with  protecting  children  from \n18  “mistreatment,  exploitation,  and  trafficking.”  Additionally,  it  cross-references  Section  292  of  the \n19 \nImmigration  and  Nationality  Act  (“INA”),  which  specifies  representation  “at  no  expense  to  the \n20 \nGovernment.”  8 U.S.C. § 1362.  Therefore, it is clear that HHS is not required to fund access to legal \n21 \ncounsel for UAC. The TVPRA’s language and structure demonstrate Congress’s intent to establish public-\n22 \nprivate partnerships and encourage pro bono counsel as the primary source of legal assistance for UC, and \n23 \nconferring on ORR exclusive discretion to determine when direct government-funded representation \n24 \n25  might be utilized (e.g., where pro bono resources are impractical or unavailable). \n26 \n3.  The Foundational Rule  \n27  In April 2024, ORR promulgated the Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, \n28  codified at 45 C.F.R. Part 410, to establish comprehensive regulations governing its UAC program.  The \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 237\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3 \n \n\n(266 of 956), Page 266 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 266 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 11 of 30\n \n \n \n1  Rule, which became effective July 1, 2024, formalized previously informal procedures and explicitly \n2  articulated ORR’s discretion regarding legal representation funding.  Specifically, the Rule provides that \n3  ORR “shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation for certain \n4  unaccompanied children” only “to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available,” and only \n5  if securing pro bono counsel is impractical. 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). \n6  In contrast, other subsections impose mandatory obligations.  For instance, the Rule explicitly \n7  requires ORR to ensure UAC receive mandatory services such as a “presentation concerning the rights \n8  and responsibilities of undocumented children,” “information regarding the availability of free legal \n9  assistance,” and a “confidential legal consultation.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(2)(i)-(v).  This intentional \n10  distinction clarifies that direct funding for legal representation remains discretionary, conditional upon the \n11  availability of appropriations, and subject to agency determination. The Rule also reinforces congressional \n12  policy choices articulated in the TVPRA, highlighting the preferred reliance on pro bono counsel and \n13  emphasizing that direct representation services funded by ORR are not guaranteed and remain subject to \n14  the agency’s discretionary resource management. \n15  4.  Appropriations Acts and Congressional Intent \nCongress  periodically  appropriates  funds  to  support  ORR’s  UAC  program,  including  legal \n16 \nservices.  Appropriations language, however, consistently remains broad and nonspecific regarding \n17 \nprecise funding allocations.  Ex. A, Declaration of Toby Biswas (“Biswas Decl.”), ¶ 16. For example, the \n18 \nFurther Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, provides general appropriations to \n19 \nexecute activities under Section 235 of the TVPRA without earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal \n20 \nrepresentation.  This general appropriation approach allows ORR flexibility in determining the allocation \n21 \nof resources based on agency priorities, the availability of pro bono counsel, and shifting immigration \n22 \npolicy needs. Biswas Decl., ¶ 16. \n23 \nSubsequent acts, including the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \n24 \nPub. L. No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding levels and provide broad discretion without altering \n25 \nstatutory obligations or imposing specific mandates for funding legal representation. Id. This ongoing \n26 \nlegislative practice underscores Congress’s intent to maintain flexibility for ORR, allowing the agency to \n27 \nprioritize  resources  efficiently  and  adaptively.  Id.  Such  discretionary  funding  practices  reflect  a \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 238\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4 \n \n\n(267 of 956), Page 267 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 267 of 956\n \n \n \n1  longstanding  Congressional  policy  to  balance  support  for  legal  services  with  practical  constraints, \n2  prioritizing public-private partnerships and pro bono resources where feasible, rather than imposing fixed \n3  or rigid funding mandates. Id. \n4  Indeed, at least one other court has considered this issue and determined that Congress did not \n5  specify what types of legal services ORR must fund with the appropriations intended for carrying out \n6  Section 235 of the TVPRA. Lucas R. v. Becerra, No. CV 18-5741, 2022 WL 2177454, at *31 (C.D. Cal. \n7  Mar. 11, 2022). Rather, ORR is “entitled to prioritize what type of legal representation ORR supports with \n8  appropriated funds, in furtherance of the TVPRA.” Id. The same analysis applies here: without a mandate \n9  from Congress in the most recent appropriations legislation, ORR has discretion to prioritize what types \n10  of services it funds to further the purpose of the TVPRA.  \n11  5.  The Current Contract and Termination Decision \nThe present dispute arises from ORR’s partial termination and descoping of a federal contract \n12 \nadministered by the Department of the Interior (“DOI”), which serves as the contracting agent through its \n13 \nInterior Business Center.  Id. ¶ 13. ORR directed DOI to partially terminate a contract previously funding \n14 \ndirect legal representation services.  Id. ¶¶ 12–13. This termination was executed through a formal decision \n15 \nmemorandum signed by the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Administration for Children and Families \n16 \n(“ACF”). Id. ¶¶ 13–14. \n17 \nORR’s  decision  reflects  a  deliberate  exercise  of  statutory  discretion  to  prioritize  available \n18 \nappropriations and pro bono legal services.  While general direct representation contract funding was \n19 \nterminated, ORR maintains other legally required activities, including “know your rights” presentations \n20 \nand confidential legal screening consultations.  Id. ¶ 5, 11. \n21 \nThis contract termination aligns with ORR’s statutory and regulatory discretion under the TVPRA, \n22 \nthe Foundational Rule, and relevant appropriations acts, none of which mandate continuous, direct legal \n23 \nrepresentation  funding  when  viable  alternatives,  such  as  pro  bono  representation,  exist.    Id.  ¶ 14.  \n24 \nAdditionally, the termination decision reflects ORR’s commitment to fiscal responsibility, ensuring that \n25 \nlimited resources are allocated effectively, prudently managing public funds, and preserving governmental \n26 \nflexibility to respond to evolving priorities and urgent programmatic needs.  Id. ¶ 11, 16.   \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 239\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5 \n \n\n(268 of 956), Page 268 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 268 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 13 of 30\n \n \n \n1  III.  STANDARDS OF REVIEW \n2  Preliminary injunctive relief “is an extraordinary and drastic remedy,” Lopez v. Brewer, 680 F.3d \n3  1068, 1072 (9th Cir. 2012) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), that is “never awarded as of \n4  right,” Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 740 (9th Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks and citation \n5  omitted); see also Stuhlbarg Int’l Sales Co. v. John D. Brush & Co., 240 F.3d 832, 839 n.7 (9th Cir. 2001) \n6  (noting that the standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is “substantially identical” to the \n7  standard for issuing a preliminary injunction).  Thus, this relief “should not be granted unless the movant, \n8  by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.”  Lopez, 680 F.3d at 1072 (internal quotation marks \n9  and citation omitted; emphasis in original).  This is a “difficult task.”  Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton, 626 \n10  F.3d 462, 469 (9th Cir. 2010).  To prove their entitlement to such relief, Plaintiffs must establish that:  (1) \n11  they are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \n12  preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in their favor, and (4) an injunction is in the public \n13  interest.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  Under the Ninth Circuit’s sliding \n14  scale test for preliminary injunctive relief, “serious questions going to the merits” and “a hardship balance \n15  that tips sharply toward the plaintiff can support issuance of an injunction, assuming the other two \n16  elements of the Winter test are also met.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1132 (9th \n17  Cir. 2011). \n18  IV.  ARGUMENT \n19  A.  Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits. \n1.  Plaintiffs lack standing because they are not within the zone of interests that            \n20 \n8 U.S.C. § 1232 is intended to protect. \n21  Plaintiffs lack standing because the statutory provision that, according to Plaintiffs, ensures that \n22  UAC have access to legal counsel, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), was not intended to protect Plaintiffs. When an \n23  organization challenges an agency action under the APA, the organization must show that it is within the \n24  “zone of interests” that the statute was meant to protect. Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 883 \n25  (1990); I.N.S. v. Legalization Assistance Project of Los Angeles Cnty. Fed’n of Lab., 510 U.S. 1301, 1305 \n26  (1993). To fall within the “zone of interests” of a statutory provision, “the plaintiff must establish that the \n27  injury he complains of (his aggrievement, or the adverse effect upon him) falls within the ‘zone of \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 240\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6 \n \n\n(269 of 956), Page 269 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 269 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 14 of 30\n \n \n \n1  interests’ sought to be protected by the statutory provision whose violation forms the legal basis for his \n2  complaint.” Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. 871, 883 (1990); Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \n3  Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224 (2012). When a plaintiff brings an APA claim \n4  against a federal agency, courts look to “the statute that [the plaintiff] says was violated,” rather than the \n5  APA itself to determine whether the party’s injury is within the zone of interests. Match-E-Be-Nash-She-\n6  Wish, 567 U.S. at 224 (quotation marks omitted). While an “explicit mention” of Congress’s intent is not \n7  required, something in the “particular provision of law upon which the plaintiff relies” must indicate that \n8  Congress intended to protect the organization. Pit River Tribe v. BLM, 793 F.3d 1147, 1157 (9th Cir. \n9  2015) (citation omitted). That an agency rule or policy may affect the way an organization allocates its \n10  resources does not give standing to an entity which is not within the zone of interests the statute meant to \n11  protect. Legalization Assistance Project, 510 U.S. at 1305.  \n12  Nothing in the text of 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), nor in the legislative history, indicates that Congress \n13  enacted the legal-services provision to address the financial interests of organizations such as Plaintiffs in \n14  this case. Rather, the plain text focuses on the interests of the UAC: it requires HHS, to the greatest extent \n15  practicable and “consistent with 8 U.S.C. § 1362,” to ensure that certain UAC “have counsel to represent \n16  them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” \n17  Id. § 1232(c)(5). This provision protects UAC from mistreatment, not to line Plaintiffs’ pocketbooks with \n18  taxpayer funding. Indeed, when reviewing the statute as a whole, the only intended beneficiary of \n19  subsection (c), entitled “Providing safe and secure placements for children,” are UAC.1  \n20  Moreover, Congress’s caveat that such legal services must be “consistent with 8 U.S.C. 1362” \n21  demonstrates that Congress did not intend for the government to front the bill for legal services or to pay \n22  organizations, such as Plaintiffs. 8 U.S.C. § 1362 provides that aliens have the right to representation in \n23  immigration proceedings, as long as the representation is “at no expense to the Government.” Congress’s \n24   \n1 Each sub-subsection provides safeguards for ensuring the safety of UAC who are in HHS’s custody. See \n25  id. § 1232(c)(1) (requiring agencies to implement policies to protect UAC from trafficking, victimization, \nand exploitation); id. § 1232(c)(2) (requiring UAC to be placed in the least restrictive setting that is in \n26 \ntheir best interest); id. § 1232(c)(3) (requiring that UAC be placed with custodians who will provide for \ntheir well-being); id. § 1232(c)(4) (ensuring that custodians receive legal orientation explaining the \n27 \ncustodian’s responsibility to ensure that the UAC appear at immigration proceedings and are protected \n28  from harm); id. § 1232(c)(5) (see supra); id. § 1232(c)(6) (authorizing HHS to appoint child advocates for \nUAC who are particularly vulnerable).  \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 241\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  7 \n \n\n(270 of 956), Page 270 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 270 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 15 of 30\n \n \n \n1  reference to this statutory provision allows no room for doubt: Congress directed HHS to refrain from \n2  using taxpayer funding to pay for UAC legal services in immigration proceedings. Further, the second \n3  part  of  § 1232(c)(5)  confirms  that  Congress  did  not  intend  to  financially  benefit  legal-services \n4  organizations. Congress required that HHS “shall make every effort to utilize the services of pro bono \n5  counsel” who will represent UAC “without charge.” Id. § 1232(c)(5). Congress intended that HHS would \n6  not spend money on legal services for UAC and, instead, would seek counsel who would represent UAC \n7  without using taxpayer funding. Id.  \n8  Further, Congress’s provision for funding child advocates in subsection (c) implies that Congress’s \n9  silence—or, indeed, prohibition—regarding funding for legal services confirms that Congress never \n10  intended for legal-service providers to receive taxpayer funding. “[I]t is generally presumed that Congress \n11  acts intentionally and purposely when it includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits \n12  it in another.” BFP v. Resolution Trust Corp., 511 U.S. 531 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n13  Congress explicitly provides federal funding for child advocates, and thereby intends to benefit child \n14  advocates, in subsection (c)(6). By comparison, in subsection (c)(5), Congress discourages federal funding \n15  for legal-service providers, mandating that HHS secure “pro bono” counsel and prohibiting federal \n16  funding for counsel in immigration proceedings. The juxtaposition of these two subsections leaves no \n17  doubt as to Congress’s intent: federal funding should not be used to fund legal-service organizations like \n18  Plaintiffs. \n19  That Plaintiffs have lost funding and need to reallocate resources does not place them within the \n20  zone of interests that Congress meant to protect. Accordingly, Plaintiffs likely cannot show that they have \n21  standing to challenge HHS’s funding decisions under the APA.  \n22 \n23 \nPlaintiffs are also unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim because they seek monetary \n24 \nrelief, and the APA does not waive sovereign immunity over such claims. Although styled as a request \n25 \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief, the relief that they seek is simple: they want to compel the United \n26 \nStates to continue making payments—relief precluded under the APA. \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 242\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  8 \n \n\n(271 of 956), Page 271 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 271 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 16 of 30\n \n \n \n1  “It is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the existence \n2  of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.” United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 212 (1983). \n3  Accordingly, before a court may exercise jurisdiction over any suit against the United States, the plaintiff \n4  must unequivocally show that the United States has waived sovereign immunity, and that their claims fall \n5  squarely within the terms of that waiver. United States v. White Mountain Apache Tribe, 537 U.S. 465, \n6  472 (2003) (citations omitted); see also Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996) (stating that the waiver \n7  of sovereign immunity cannot be implied, but “must be unequivocally expressed in statutory text.”).  \n8  Relevant here, the APA only waives sovereign immunity over actions seeking relief “other than \n9  monetary damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. The APA “does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims \n10  seeking equitable relief.” N. Star Alaska v. United States, 14 F.3d 36, 38 (9th Cir. 1994) (cleaned up). As \n11  a result, a court must carefully discern whether a request dressed up as a claim for injunctive or declaratory \n12  relief is actually seeking monetary relief, as “any claim for legal relief can, with lawyerly inventiveness, \n13  be phrased in terms of an injunction.” Great-W. Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 211 \n14  n.1 (2002).  \n15  The APA does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity here because the relief Plaintiffs seek \n16  is payment. Specifically, Plaintiffs ask this Court to: (1) declare that “Defendants are required to continue \n17  funding legal representation to unaccompanied alien children, consistent with the TVPRA and ORR’s \n18  Foundational  Rule;  (2)  enjoin  Defendants  nationwide  from  ceasing  to  fund  counsel  to  represent \n19  unaccompanied alien children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule; (3) to declare that \n20  Defendants’ actions violate the APA; and (4) to set aside Defendants’ actions. ECF No. 1 at 39 (emphases \n21  added).2  Regardless of how Plaintiffs label their request for relief, the result of granting any of their \n22  requests is the same: HHS must continue paying Acacia, and consequently, continue paying Plaintiffs. \n23  The APA does not waive sovereign immunity for such a claim, and thus, this Court lacks jurisdiction to \n24  order Defendants to provide Plaintiffs with the monetary relief they seek. N. Star Alaska, 14 F.3d at 38. \n25 \n26 \n \n27 \n2 Page number references, when to filings on the Court’s docket in this case, are to the page number in \n28  the header supplied by the Court’s ECF system.  \n \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 243\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  9 \n \n\n(272 of 956), Page 272 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 272 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 17 of 30\n \n \n \n1  The APA also does not provide a waiver of sovereign immunity here because HHS’s funding \n2  decision under the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule are discretionary. The APA does not permit judicial \n3  review of “agency action” that “is committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  The \n4  TVPRA provides HHS broad discretion in determining how to provide legal services to UAC. While \n5  Section 235 mandates that HHS ensure that counsel is available to represent UAC “to the greatest extent \n6  practicable” in “legal proceedings or matters,” it also cross-references the provision of the INA—8 U.S.C. \n7  § 1362—which specifies that “the privilege” of being represented in removal proceedings is “at no \n8  expense to the Government.” The TVPRA also directs HHS to “make every effort to utilize the services \n9  of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation without charge.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). Likewise, \n10  the Foundational Rule explicitly articulates ORR’s discretion regarding legal representation funding.  It \n11  provides that ORR “shall fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation \n12  for  certain  unaccompanied  children”  only  “to  the  extent  ORR  determines  that  appropriations  are \n13  available,” and only if securing pro bono counsel is impractical. 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). The decision \n14  to fund direct legal services is “subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations.” Id. \n15  Moreover, Congress’s funding of ORR’s UAC program, including legal services, demonstrates \n16  that HHS has been allowed discretion in how it allocates resources.  For example, the Further Consolidated \n17  Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, provides general appropriations to execute activities under \n18  Section 235 of the TVPRA without earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal representation. And \n19  subsequent acts, including the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. \n20  No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding levels and provide broad discretion without altering statutory \n21  obligations or imposing specific mandates for funding legal representation. Id. ¶ 16.  This ongoing \n22  legislative practice underscores Congress’s intent to maintain flexibility for ORR, allowing the agency to \n23  prioritize resources efficiently and adaptively.  Id.; see also 6 U.S.C. 279(b)(1) (making the Director of \n24  ORR  responsible  for  activities  including  coordinating  and  implementing  the  care  of  UAC  and \n25  implementing  policies  with  respect  to  the  care  and  placement  of  unaccompanied  alien  children);                      \n26  8 U.S.C. § 1232(i) (authorizing the Secretary of HHS to “award grants to, and enter into contracts with, \n27  voluntary agencies to carry out this section and section 279 of title 6.”). \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 244\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  10 \n \n\n(273 of 956), Page 273 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 273 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 18 of 30\n \n \n \n1  The Court therefore lacks jurisdiction because decisions about the substance of HHS’s decision to \n2  reallocate resources from direct representation into other aspects of the UAC program is firmly committed \n3  to the agency’s discretion.  In Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993), the Supreme Court held that the \n4  Indian Health Service’s decision to discontinue a program it had previously funded and to instead \n5  reallocate those funds to other programs was committed to agency discretion by law and thus not \n6  reviewable under the APA’s reasoned-decision making standards.  See id. at 185–88.  The Court explained \n7  that the “allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation is” an “administrative decision traditionally \n8  regarded as committed to agency discretion,” because the “very point of a lump-sum appropriation is to \n9  give an agency the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in \n10  what it sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at 192. \n11  Indeed, an agency’s allocation of funds from a lump-sum appropriation requires “a complicated \n12  balancing of a number of factors which are peculiarly within its expertise”: whether its “resources are best \n13  spent” on one program or another; whether it “is likely to succeed” in fulfilling its statutory mandate; \n14  whether a particular program “best fits the agency’s overall policies”; and, “indeed, whether the agency \n15  has enough resources to fund a program at all.”  Id. at 193 (internal citations omitted).  “Congress may \n16  always circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative \n17  statutes.”  Id.  But as long as the agency abides by the relevant statutes (and whatever self-imposed \n18  obligations may arise from regulations or grant instruments), the APA “gives the courts no leave to \n19  intrude.”  Id.  Because the TVPRA confers HHS discretion to determine how best to allocate and \n20  administer the funding for the UAC program, HHS’s decisions are not subject to review under the APA. \n21  3.  This Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims because the rights they \nseek to enforce must be brought in the Federal Court of Claims. \n22 \n Although Plaintiffs cite to the APA as the basis for their claims, the rights that they seek to enforce, \n23 \nand the relief that they seek, are only available to them through contract, and thus their claims are \n24 \nprecluded by the Tucker Act.3\n25 \n26 \n \n27  3 The Tucker Act provides: “The United States Court of Federal Claims shall have jurisdiction to render judgment \nupon any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any \n28  regulation of an executive department, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1491(a)(1) (emphasis added). \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 245\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  11 \n \n\n(274 of 956), Page 274 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 274 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 19 of 30\n \n \n \n1  claim is based upon a contract with the United States and subject to the jurisdictional restrictions in the \n2  Tucker Act. North Side Lumber v. Block, 753 F.2d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 931 \n3  (1985) (citing Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 967–68 (D.C. Cir. 1982)). The Tucker Act \n4  “impliedly forbids” APA claims involving government contracts. Id. at 1485 (citing H.R. Rep. No. 1656, \n5  94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13). To determine whether the Tucker Act precludes a contract claim “disguised” as \n6  an APA claim, the Ninth Circuit employs the D.C. Circuit’s Megapulse test. United Aeronautical Corp. \n7  v. United States Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1025–26 (9th Cir. 2023) (citing Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–\n8  68). Under Megapulse, a court must decide whether “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff \n9  bases its claims” arises under a contract and whether “the type of relief sought” is normally available as a \n10  contract remedy. Id. “If rights and remedies are statutorily or constitutionally based, then districts courts \n11  have jurisdiction; if rights and remedies are contractually based then only the Court of Federal Claims \n12  does, even if the plaintiff formally seeks injunctive relief.” Id. (emphases in original).  \n13  Two weeks ago, a district court in the District of Columbia decided a case very similar to this one \n14  and determined that the plaintiff organization’s claims resounded in contact and, thus, had to be brought \n15  in the Court of Federal Claims. United States Conf. of Cath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:25-CV-\n16  00465, 2025 WL 763738, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025). Like here, the relief sought in Conf. of Cath. \n17  Bishops was styled as a request for an injunction, yet the court correctly reasoned that, in actuality, the \n18  relief sought was for “the Government to keep paying up.” Id. at *5. The district court therefore held that \n19  the claim was “founded upon a contract” and “must be heard in Claims Court.” Id. at *7 (citing Sharp v. \n20  Weinberger, 798 F.2d 1521, 1524 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.) (“We know of no case in which a court has \n21  asserted jurisdiction . . . to issue an injunction compelling the United States to fulfill its contractual \n22  obligations.”)). So too here. \n23  As explained, Section IV.A.2, supra, the relief Plaintiffs seek is for “the Government to keep \n24  paying up,” Conf. of Cath. Bishops, 2025 WL 763738, at *2. Because they seek monetary relief, which is \n25  unavailable under the APA but normally available in a contract dispute, their claim is precluded by the \n26  Tucker Act. Id. at *7; United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1025–26. \n27  Not only does Plaintiffs’ requested relief resound in contract, but the “source of rights” upon which \n28  they base their claims arises from a contract. Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967–68. Plaintiffs cannot separate \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 246\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  12 \n \n\n(275 of 956), Page 275 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 275 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 20 of 30\n \n \n \n1  their causes of action from their contractual relationship with Acacia. Plaintiffs lack standing to assert \n2  claims against the United States absent the contract that HHS has with Acacia because without it they \n3  would have no injury. In other words, had Acacia never entered into a contract with HHS to provide direct \n4  legal services to UAC, Plaintiffs would have never received funding to provide such legal services and \n5  would have no injury to complain of. No statute or regulation requires HHS to compensate Plaintiffs for \n6  their legal services. Absent a statutory or constitutional entitlement to the appropriated funds that they \n7  seek, their injury arises from termination of a contract. Because Plaintiffs’ “source of rights” for funding \n8  from appropriations stems solely from their contract with Acacia, this Court lacks jurisdiction over their \n9  claims. Id. at 967–68; United Aeronautical Corp., 80 F.4th at 1025–26. \n10  4.  Plaintiffs cannot show that a favorable decision in this case would likely \nredress their alleged injuries. \n11 \nTo the extent Plaintiffs argue that they are not challenging the government’s decision to end the \n12 \ncontract with Acacia but, rather, the decision to discontinue providing appropriated funds to any legal-\n13 \nservices organization, they likewise lack standing to assert such a claim. The “irreducible constitutional \n14 \nminimum” of Article III standing consists of (1) “injury in fact,” (2) “a causal connection between the \n15 \ninjury and the conduct complained of,” and (3) a likelihood “that the injury will be redressed by a favorable \n16 \ndecision.” Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992) (quotation marks omitted). The \n17 \nthird element of Article III standing, redressability, requires that it “be likely, as opposed to merely \n18 \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (citation and \n19 \ninternal quotation marks omitted). To show a likelihood of redressability, Plaintiffs must “show that there \n20 \nwould be a ‘change in a legal status’ as a consequence of a favorable decision” and that this change would \n21 \nsignificantly increase the likelihood that they would obtain the relief sought. Novak v. United States, 795 \n22 \nF.3d 1012, 1019–20 (9th Cir. 2015) (quoting Renee v. Duncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012)).  \n23 \nThe relief that Plaintiffs seek—if untethered to their contract claim—would not likely provide \n24 \nthem with the monetary relief they seek. Enforcing the statutory authority Plaintiffs rely on in arguing that \n25 \nCongress intended to fund direct-legal services, 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), would have the opposite effect of \n26 \nthe relief Plaintiffs seek. As explained above, Congress did not intend to financially benefit Plaintiffs in \n27 \n28  ensuring that UAC would have access to legal services; instead, Congress envisioned that such legal \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 247\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  13 \n \n\n(276 of 956), Page 276 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 276 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 21 of 30\n \n \n \n1  services would generally be provided pro bono at no expense to the government. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \n2 \nIf the Court were to enforce the plain language and purpose of Section 235 of the TVPRA, it would order \n3 \nthe government to seek out pro bono counsel for direct legal services and, to the extent possible, avoid \n4 \nfunding legal services at the government’s expense. Of course, this result would not redress Plaintiffs’ \n5 \ninjuries, as they seek to be paid for their services and not acting in a pro bono capacity. \n6 \nLikewise, because the Foundational Rule provides HHS with discretion as to whether and how to \n7 \ndisburse appropriations for direct legal services, Plaintiffs cannot show that ordering HHS to comply with \n8 \nits regulation would redress their injury. Under the plain language of the regulation, HHS would maintain \n9 \nthe discretion to determine whether to fund direct-legal services for UAC, and, using that discretion, it \n10 \nwould likely continue to decline to continue funding. Biswas Decl., ¶ 17. And even if HHS changed course \n11 \nand decided to exercise favorable discretion by funding direct legal services, it could contract with \n12 \norganizations other than Acacia and Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 19. There is nothing that Plaintiffs can cite to that \n13 \nwould require or encourage HHS to continue funding the Plaintiffs in this case. Id. ¶¶ 17-19. In other \n14 \nwords, even if the agency continued funding direct legal services, Plaintiffs cannot show that it is likely \n15 \nthat HHS will continue to contract with Acacia or with any of the Plaintiffs in this case. Id. Thus, Plaintiffs’ \n16 \nredressability—that HHS would continue funding Acacia or any of the Plaintiffs—is speculative at best \n17 \nand insufficient to establish standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561. Accordingly, Plaintiffs fail to show that they \n18 \nlikely have Article III standing because enforcing the relevant policies and statutes would not redress their \n19 \nalleged injury. \n20 \n5.  The Termination Contract Termination at Issue Does Not Violate the APA   \n21 \nPlaintiffs erroneously argue that termination of direct legal services violate the APA. Although, \n22 \nthe money was authorized by Congress, Congress never mandated its spending. When Congress does not \n23 \nrequire the agency to spend a certain amount of the appropriated fund, the agency has discretion over how \n24 \nmuch to spend up to the cap provided by Congress. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass’n \n25 \nof Am., Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 432 (2024) (“The appropriation of “sums not exceeding” a specified amount \n26 \ndid not by itself mandate that the Executive spend that amount; as was the case in England, such \n27 \nappropriations instead provided the Executive discretion over how much to spend up to a cap.”).

Salazar v. Ramah Navajo Chapter, 567 U.S. 182 (2012) (“An agency’s discretion to spend \n4  appropriated funds is cabined only by the ‘text of the appropriation,’ not by Congress’ expectations of \n5  how the funds will be spent, as might be reflected by legislative history.”) (quoting Int’l Union, UAW v. \n6  Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 860-61 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Scalia, J.))  \n7  6.  The  Foundational  Rule  Does  Not  Require  Funding  for  Taxpayer-funded \nDirect  Immigration  Legal  Representation  Consistent  with  Available \n8 \nAppropriations.   \n9  Plaintiffs  contend  that  Defendants  have  “ended”  funding  for  legal  representation  of \n10  unaccompanied alien children despite the availability of appropriated funds for this purpose through at \n11  least September 30, 2027, and that, by the supposed ending, Defendants violate what they believe is a \n12  mandate in the Foundational Rule to provide counsel for UAC to the extent there are appropriated funds \n13  available to do so.  ECF No. 1 ¶ 139.  As Plaintiffs note, to establish a claim under United States ex rel. \n14  Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 266–67 (1954), such a claim must show: (1) that the government \n15  has violated its own regulations; and (2) that Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced by that violation. \n16  ECF No. 7 at 14 (citing  Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. Mayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. \n17  30, 2024)). To start, Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants have violated their own regulations. \n18  Indeed, Plaintiffs overlook the fact that the funding at issue here is required only “insofar that it is not \n19  practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  As HHS noted in the \n20  preamble to its Foundational Rule, ORR, consistent with the TVPRA, makes every effort to use pro \n21  bono legal services “to the greatest extent practicable” to secure counsel for UAC in these contexts.  \n22  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34,529 (Apr. 30, 2024).  \n23  HHS notes that ORR-funded legal services providers may help coordinate referral to pro bono legal \n24  services and that ORR provides each UAC with a list of pro bono service providers.4  Id.  Historically, \n25  HHS has acknowledged that, in some cases, it is impracticable for ORR to secure pro bono legal \n26  services, such as in markets where demand exceeds supply, or during times of influx.  Id.  But where \n27 \n \n28  4 The list of pro bono service providers is statutorily required under the TVPRA. 6 U.S.C. § 279(b)(1)(I).   \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 249\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  15 \n \n\n(278 of 956), Page 278 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 278 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 23 of 30\n \n \n \n1  and when it is “impracticable” for ORR to secure pro bono legal services is a determination to be made \n2  by ORR. Id. (noting that the decision is subject to ORR’s “discretion.”). Further, since ORR must be \n3  selective in the kinds of legal services it funds, it therefore proposed to establish its discretion to fund \n4  legal services for specific purposes “based on its judgment and priorities.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 34,529.  The \n5  clause “based on its judgment and priorities” reflects that ORR has considerable discretion to determine \n6  how the provision of legal services to UAC is funded.  The determination of when such provision is \n7  “impracticable” is a decision to be made exclusively by ORR, applying its expertise, and not by \n8  Plaintiffs or the Court.  \n9  Plaintiffs next overlook the fact that ORR shall fund legal service providers subject to ORR’s \n10  discretion,5\n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15  Plaintiffs note that HHS has an obligation “to the greatest extent practicable” and consistent with \n16  8 U.S.C. § 1362, to ensure that UAC have counsel in their immigration proceedings.  HHS interpreted \n17  “to the greatest extent practicable” to open the door to a grant of authority to pay for legal services \n18  beyond that available from pro bono legal service providers.  89 Fed. Reg. at 24,529.  “To the greatest \n19  extent practicable,” however, cannot reasonably be read as a mandate for HHS to pay for direct \n20  immigration legal representation for all UAC, unconditionally.  In the preamble to the Foundational \n21  Rule, HHS stated that it “understands that some commenters would like ORR “to fully fund legal \n22  services to all [UAC].”  Id.  HHS also observed that it received comments questioning ORR’s legal \n23  authority to pay for legal services for UAC and suggesting that ORR not use taxpayer funding for legal \n24  representation for UAC.  Id.  HHS concluded that its approach to providing legal services to UAC, by \n25  enabling them to access ORR has determined that “its approach to  providing legal services to \n26  unaccompanied  children  by  enabling  them  to  access  pro  bono  counsel  ‘to  the  greatest  extent \n27 \n \n28  5 Defendants do not contest that the conditions “to the extent ORR determines that appropriations are \navailable” and “subject to . . .available appropriations,” in 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), are met here.  \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 250\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  16 \n \n\n(279 of 956), Page 279 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 279 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 24 of 30\n \n \n \n1  practicable’ and funding legal services for additional unaccompanied children, as resources allow, is \n2  consistent with ORR’s statutory obligations.”  Id.  HHS’s interpretation of the INA and TVPRA – as \n3  Congress’s grant of discretion to ORR to provide funding for immigration services to UAC – is far \n4  from a mandate to do provide such funding.   \n5  Similarly, and as Plaintiffs point out, HHS did acknowledge that most UAC need legal services \n6  to resolve their immigration status, and such representation appears to have a significant impact on \n7  court appearance.  ECF No. 7 at 13 (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 34,529).  Further, as Plaintiffs note, HHS \n8  affirmed that “legal services providers who represent unaccompanied children undertake an important \n9  function” and explains ORR’s goal of “100 percent legal representation of unaccompanied children.”  \n10  Id. (citing 89 Fed. Reg. at 34,526).  But Plaintiffs fail to explain why they believe that such services \n11  must be funded by the taxpayer.  HHS’s shift to increased emphasis and reliance upon pro bono service \n12  providers might not be Plaintiffs’ preference, but it is consistent with the plain language of section \n13  1309(a)(4) and HHS’s explanations for why it sculpted the language in 1309(a)(4) as it did.  In their \n14  motion for a TRO, however, Plaintiffs are silent regarding the importance of pro bono counsel in \n15  providing advice and legal representation for UAC, an importance reflected in both section 1309(a)(4) \n16  and the preamble.  ECF No. 7.   \n17  B.  Plaintiffs Will Not Face Irreparable Harm Without a TRO  \n18  The “most important” Winter factor is whether Plaintiffs demonstrate irreparable harm.  Caribbean \n19  Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 F.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988); see also Koller v. Brown, 224 F. Supp. \n20  3d 871, 879 (N.D. Cal. 2016) (noting it is the “single most important prerequisite” for a TRO).  The \n21  “possibility” of harm is insufficient to secure a TRO; Plaintiffs must show that “irreparable injury is likely \n22  in the absence of an injunction.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (emphasis in original).  “Speculative injury” does \n23  not suffice; Plaintiffs must show both immediacy and likelihood that they will be harmed absent a TRO.  \n24  See Caribbean Marine Servs. Co., 844 F.2d at 674.  Where “[m]ultiple contingencies must occur” before \n25  Plaintiffs’ claimed injuries, the injuries are “too speculative” to justify a TRO.  Id. at 675.   \n26  Plaintiffs have failed to make the requisite threshold “clear showing of irreparable harm.”  See \n27  Garcia, 786 F.3d at 746 (reiterating that “[h]arm must be proved, not presumed”).  Plaintiffs have failed \n28  to  demonstrate  irreparable  harm  sufficient  to  warrant  extraordinary injunctive  relief.

Dream Act Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014); \n4  Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. Nat’l Football League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1202 (9th Cir. 1980) \n5  (“Monetary injury is not normally considered irreparable.”). Economic damages are not traditionally \n6  considered irreparable because the injury can later be remedied by a damage award. See Sampson v. \n7  Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 90 (1974) (“[I]t seems clear that the temporary loss of income, ultimately to be \n8  recovered, does not usually constitute irreparable injury . . . .” (internal quotation omitted)); Caribbean \n9  Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldridge, 844 F.2d 668, 676 (9th Cir. 1988) (“Subjective apprehensions and \n10  unsupported predictions of revenue loss are not sufficient to satisfy a plaintiff’s burden of demonstrating \n11  an immediate threat of irreparable harm.”); Arcamuzi v. Continental Air Lines, Inc., 819 F.2d 935, 938 \n12  (9th Cir. 1987) (“[Temporary economic loss alone generally is not a basis for injunctive relief.”); \n13  Goldie’s Bookstore, Inc. v. Superior Court, 739 F.2d 466, 471 (9th Cir. 1984) (“Mere financial injury . . . \n14  will not constitute irreparable harm if adequate compensatory relief will be available in the course of \n15  litigation.”).                        \n16    While Plaintiffs characterize their harm as “frustrating their mission,” the actual harm that \n17  Plaintiffs allege is “lack of funding,” which is plainly monetary harm. See ECF No. 7 at 16 (“There is no \n18  question that ceasing funding for legal representation services for UAC and terminating the existing \n19  services will cause imminent harm that cannot be later remediated.”) (emphasis added); id. at 17 \n20  (“Plaintiffs have relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding for these critical resources \n21  will continue to be available.”) (emphasis added); id. (“Sustaining these services without this funding \n22  will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.”) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs \n23  cannot avoid the well-established case law holding that monetary loss (even if significant), is not \n24  irreparable harm.  \n25  Plaintiffs next allege  that “ceasing funding for legal representation services for UAC and \n26  terminating existing contracts will cause imminent harm” because it will cause them to cease providing \n27  certain legal services. ECF No. 7 at 16. But that too is without merit as the Cancellation Order does not \n28  prevent Plaintiffs from continuing to provide legal services – it merely prevents them from receipt of \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 252\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  18 \n \n\n(281 of 956), Page 281 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 281 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 26 of 30\n \n \n \n1  federally funded payment for those services. Indeed, Plaintiffs may freely  provide these services pro \n2  bono, which is in line with the plain language and purpose of 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and would be \n3  welcomed by Defendants. \n4  Plaintiffs’ further assertion that “impacted attorneys and staff have years of individualized \n5  experience and wisdom with clients making rehiring layoffs impracticable” is speculative and attenuated. \n6  ECF No. 7 at 18. “Certain impending” injury cannot be shown when the asserted injury is based on a \n7  “speculative chain of possibilities,” Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013), or on \n8  “speculation about the decisions of independent actors,” id. at 414. As the D.C. Circuit has cautioned: \n9  “Because of the generally contingent nature of predictions of future third-party action,” a court should \n10  be “sparing in crediting claims of anticipated injury by market actors and other parties alike.” Arpaio v. \n11  Obama, 797 F.3d 11, 23 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The Court should likewise decline to entertain Plaintiffs’ \n12  speculative assertion about what third parties—individuals who might be laid off—would do if called \n13  back to work. \n14  C.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Weigh Against Entry of a Temporary \nRestraining Order.  \n15 \nWhere the government is a party, the balance of equities and public interest factors merge.  Drakes \n16 \nBay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d 1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n17 \n(2009)).  Courts “explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the \n18 \npublic at large.”  Barnes v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) \n19 \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  In weighing these factors, Plaintiffs rely on their previous \n20 \narguments pointing to their allegation that harm arises from Defendants’ “shirking [of] their voluntarily \n21 \nundertaken obligations.” Motion at 19. But as described above, neither the purported merit of their claims \n22 \nnor their alleged injury support entry of a TRO.  This is particularly true because Plaintiffs make no \n23 \nattempt to explain how the broad relief requested in their proposed order (Dkt. 7-3) is tethered to the harms \n24 \nthey claim.  On the other hand, Defendants are legally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement \n25 \nof their federal grants.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1232; 45 C.F.R. § 410.   \n26 \nHere, the balance of the equities and public interest tip decisively in Defendants’ favor.  If the \n27 \nstatus quo is preserved during the pendency of the case, Plaintiffs can still obtain any funding they may \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 253\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  19 \n \n\n(282 of 956), Page 282 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 282 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 27 of 30\n \n \n \n1  be entitled to as a result of the case’s ultimate resolution.  But the opposite is not true—if Plaintiffs are \n2  given access now, and draw down the funds throughout the litigation, Defendants will be left with no \n3  meaningful recourse even if they prevail.  Defendants will bear all the risk if the Court enters a preliminary \n4  injunction, whereas Plaintiffs will bear none if it denies one. Such a proposition turns Plaintiffs’ burden \n5  of establishing irreparable harm on its head. In short, the equities clearly favor Defendants. \n6  Plaintiffs’ motion fails to acknowledge the governmental harm that will be imposed through \n7  injunctive relief here, suggesting that the TRO is merely to spend appropriated funds. This ignores the \n8  substantial harm an injunction imposes by usurping executive branch authority to manage complex \n9  programs and allocate billions in taxpayer funds. Forcing continuation of one specific contract hinders \n10  ORR’s ability to adapt to potentially changing migration flows, shelter needs, health concerns, or to \n11  implement potentially more cost-effective or impactful service models across the entire UAC program \n12  spectrum.  \n13  What’s more, the public interests at stake here include effective governance. While Plaintiffs \n14  legitimately describe the public interest in protecting vulnerable children and upholding the TVPRA, the \n15  public  interest  also  encompasses  the  efficient,  flexible,  and  responsible  administration  of  federal \n16  programs, interests which are opposed to forcing the government to continue to fund paid attorneys. It \n17  includes ensuring ORR can make difficult choices to best serve the overall needs of all unaccompanied \n18  alien  children  within  its  care,  using  its  expertise  and  the  discretion  Congress  provided.  Judicial \n19  micromanagement of appropriations allocation via Plaintiffs’ requested TRO arguably undermines, rather \n20  than serves, the broader public interest in competent government. \n21  Indeed, an injunction here would effectively disable the administration from effectuating its \n22 \nexecutive authority consistent with their constitutional and statutory authorities. See Maryland v. King, \n23 \n567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers) (cleaned up) (“[a]ny time a [government] is \n24 \nenjoined by a court from effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of \n25 \nirreparable injury.”). Where the Government is legally entitled to make decisions about the disbursement \n26 \nor allocation of federal funds, but is nonetheless ordered to release the funds, such funds may not be \n27 \n28  retrievable afterwards. While Plaintiffs emphasize the mandate in 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) that HHS “shall \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 254\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  20 \n \n\n(283 of 956), Page 283 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 283 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 28 of 30\n \n \n \n1  ensure . . . that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel,” this mandate is explicitly qualified by \n2 \n“to the greatest extent practicable”. This is not mere suggestion; it is the legal standard set by Congress, \n3 \ninherently requiring agency judgment. Here, “practicable” arguably necessitates balancing the goal of \n4 \nproviding counsel against competing demands, resource limitations across the entire UAC program, \n5 \nadministrative feasibility, and the effectiveness of different service delivery models. It does not mandate \n6 \nfunding one specific contract indefinitely, irrespective of other considerations.  \n7 \n8  In sum, the decision to terminate funding under the contract represents a permissible exercise of \n9  the discretion afforded to ORR by Congress under 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), and codified in its own \n10  regulations, see 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). It is not contrary to law or arbitrary and capricious. An \n11  injunction would improperly substitute judicial preference for agency judgment, unduly restricting the \n12  executive’s ability to allocate resources and adapt to evolving needs. As a result, the balance of equities \n13  and the public interest, properly considered, weigh against granting the extraordinary relief of a TRO. \n14  D.  If the Court issues a TRO, it should require Plaintiffs to Post Security. \n15  Finally, if the Court deems a TRO warranted (which it should not), Plaintiffs should be required \n16  to post bond.  Rule 65(c) provides that a court “may issue a preliminary injunction or a temporary \n17  restraining order only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court considers proper to pay the \n18  costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. \n19  Civ. P. 65(c).  The circumstances here warrant requiring Plaintiffs to provide security in an amount that \n20  could compensate Defendants for the losses caused by a preliminary injunction (in the event that \n21  Defendants are found to have been wrongfully enjoined).  To the extent that the Court grants relief to \n22  Plaintiff, Defendants respectfully request that the Court require Plaintiffs to post security for any taxpayer \n23  funds distributed during the pendency of the Court’s Order. Since this case is ultimately about financial \n24  allocation, it thus follows that Rule 65(c)’s explicit requirements necessitate Plaintiffs’ posting of security.  \n25  V.  CONCLUSION \n26  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order. \n \n27   \n   \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ OPPOSITION TO MOTION FOR TRO \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 255\n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  21 \n \n\n(284 of 956), Page 284 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 284 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24     Filed 03/31/25     Page 29 of 30\n \n \n \n1  DATED: March 31, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

I am the Director of the Division of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) Policy for the \n13 \nUAC Bureau of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), within the Administration for Children and \n14 \nFamilies (ACF), a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). \n15 \n2.  I have held various roles within ORR since I first started working at the agency in \n16 \nNovember 2009, and I have held my current role since April 2023. My job duties include, among other \n17  things, responsibility for all aspects of the development and implementation of ORR’s policies and \nprocedures concerning the care and custody UAC, including those related to the provision of legal \n18 \nservices to UAC.  In this capacity, I am responsible for ensuring ORR’s implementation of and \n19 \ncompliance with programmatic policy prerogatives and statutory responsibilities, such as those arising \n20 \nunder the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (TVPRA), 8 U.S.C. § 1232, and \n21 \nORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 CFR part 410, which include provisions related to the provision of UAC \n22  legal services.1 \n23  3.  This declaration is based upon my personal knowledge, information acquired by me in the \n24  course of performing my official duties, information contained in the records of ACF and ORR, and \ninformation conveyed to me by current agency employees and contractors.  Further, I have reviewed the \n25 \npleadings in this matter, and am generally familiar with the facts and circumstances underlying plaintiffs’ \n26 \n27 \n \n1 ORR policies with respect to UAC are also embodied in the ORR UAC Bureau Policy Guide \n28 \n(“UAC Policy Guide”), which is publicly available on ORR’s website, and has recently been made \navailable to the public in a Freedom of Information Act reading room:  https://acf.gov/e-reading-room   \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 258\n1 \n   \n\n(287 of 956), Page 287 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 287 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 2 of 6\n \n1  allegations concerning the termination of a portion of the Acacia contract for the provision of UAC legal \nservices in March.  I also have personal knowledge of the facts and circumstances leading to the \n2 \ntermination decision at issue here. \n3 \n4.  Acacia Center for Justice (“Acacia”)2 is an ORR contractor who provides legal services \n4 \nand other assistance to UAC in and released from ORR care in the sectors defined by ORR, as explained \n5 \nbelow.  Acacia may further sub-award ORR funds to other organizations to provide these services.  In this \n6  posture, ORR has no direct relationship with these sub-awardees. Rather, as the federal contractor, Acacia \n7  is responsible under HHS regulations for, among other things, clearly identifying every sub-award as such, \nevaluating each subrecipient’s risk of noncompliance with Federal requirements, and monitoring \n8 \nsubrecipient activities to ensure the subaward is used for authorized purposes, identifying sub-awardees as \n9 \neither subrecipients or sub-contractors. See 45 CFR 75.352; see also 45 CFR 75.101(b)(1) (making 75.352 \n10 \napplicable to HHS contracts). \n11 \n12 \n13 \n14 \n15 \n16 \n6.  Acacia has provided these services pursuant to Contract 140D0422C0009. \n17 \n7.  Collectively, these services cost ACF/ORR—and by extension U.S. taxpayers—a grand \n18 \ntotal of $796,720,624.01. \n19  8.  On February 3, 2025, Acting HHS Secretary Dorothy Fink issued the “Secretarial \n20  Directive on Program Payment Integrity” (“Secretarial Directive”), which directed all HHS personnel to \nbriefly pause all payments to contractors, vendors, and grantees related to immigration and refugee \n21 \nresettlement for internal review.  A true and correct copy of the Secretarial Directive is attached hereto as \n22 \n“Exhibit 1.”   \n23 \n9.  Specifically, the Secretarial Directive directed that “Agency personnel shall briefly pause \n24 \nall payments made by the Administration for Children and Families to contractors, vendors, and grantees \n25  related to immigration and refugee resettlement for internal review for payment integrity.  Such review \n26  shall include but not be limited to a review for fraud, waste, abuse, and a review of the overall contracts \n27 \n28 \n \n2 Acacia was previously known as the Vera Institute of Justice, or “Vera.” \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 259\n2 \n   \n\n(288 of 956), Page 288 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 288 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 3 of 6\n \n1  and grants to determine whether those contracts or grants are in the best interest of the government and \nconsistent with current policy.”  Exhibit 1. \n2 \n10.  In late February, all ORR contracts, including the contract for legal services, were \n3 \nevaluated for termination and modification to reduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to \n4 \npromote efficiency and advance the policies of the President’s Administration. The evaluation consisted of \n5 \nmaking a determination of whether the contracted services were legally required, whether the services \n6  provided by the vendor aligned with the administration’s priorities, and whether the services could be \n7  provided through other means more cost effectively. During that time period, ORR leadership determined \nthat the contract for legal services was only partially required in order to meet statutory requirements and \n8 \ndecided to reduce the scope of the contract in order to reduce spending and achieve more cost efficiency. \n9 \n11.  As a result of the program integrity review conducted pursuant to the Secretarial \n10 \nDirective, ACF and ORR leadership decided, on or about March 20, 2025, to partially terminate the \n11 \nAcacia contract—which was already set to expire on March 29, 2025—with respect to the funding of \n12 \ndirect representation of UAC; however, ACF/ORR decided to renew the Acacia contract with respect to \n13  the provision of KYR trainings and legal screenings, based on its understanding of its non-discretionary \nobligations, and in keeping with the Administration’s general policy of protecting the public fisc by \n14 \nensuring taxpayer dollars are only spent on statutorily-required government-funded services. \n15 \n12.  Accordingly, on March 21, 2025, Acacia was notified of the partial termination decision \n16 \nby the Acquisition Services Directorate of the Interior Business Center within the Department of the \n17 \nInterior (“DOI”).  A true and correct copy of the Acacia partial termination notice is attached hereto as \n18 \n“Exhibit 2.”   \n19  13.  DOI provides assisted acquisition services to HHS and its component agencies, including \n20  ACF/ORR, under the Interior Franchise Fund.3  Simply put, DOI serves as the technical administrator of \nthe Acacia contract, due to its greater capacity for contract management and administration, but \n21 \nACF/ORR remains the decisionmaker with respect to all aspects of the Acacia contract, and, for that \n22 \nmatter, the development and implementation of all UAC policies, as expressly directed by Congress.  See \n23 \n6 U.S.C. §279(a), 8 U.S.C. § 1232.  DOI merely communicates those decisions to the contractor on \n24 \nACF/ORR’s behalf.  Hence, the partial termination letter Acacia received was from DOI, not ACF/ORR. \n25 \n \n26 \n27 \n28 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 260\n3 \n   \n\n(289 of 956), Page 289 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 289 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 4 of 6\n \n1  14.  As stated in the partial termination letter, ORR has determined to terminate aspects of the \nAcacia contract related to direct representation of UAC because the TVPRA does not require HHS/ORR \n2 \nto fund direct legal representation. Under the TVPRA, at 8 U.S.C. 1232(c)(5), the Secretary of HHS must \n3 \n“ensure, to the greatest extent practicable and consistent with section 292 of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1362),” \n4 \nthat all unaccompanied alien children who are or have been in its custody or in the custody of DHS, with \n5 \ncertain exceptions, have counsel “to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \n6  mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” The Secretary of Health and Human Services “shall make \n7  every effort to utilize the services of pro bono counsel who agree to provide representation to such \nchildren without charge.” 8 U.S.C. 1362 provides, “In any removal proceedings before an immigration \n8 \njudge and in any appeal proceedings before the Attorney General from any such removal proceedings, the \n9 \nperson concerned shall have the privilege of being represented (at no expense to the Government) by \n10 \nsuch counsel, authorized to practice in such proceedings, as he shall choose.” (emphasis added). ORR has \n11 \nfor several years funded at great public expense direct legal representation services for unaccompanied \n12 \nalien children. The TVPRA which authorizes such funding, does not require it, and such services are \n13  entirely at the agency’s discretion. \n15.  ORR’s regulations were written based on the understanding that it is responsible for \n14 \nproviding access to counsel, but at no expense to the government. See 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34526-27 \n15 \n(prefacing discussion of 45 CFR 410.1309 with an explanation of requirements under the TVPRA). Thus, \n16 \neven where ORR regulations describe funding direct representation of UAC (e.g., 45 CFR \n17 \n410.1309(a)(4)), the regulations state that such funding is provided “[t]o the extent ORR determines that \n18 \nappropriations are available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel.” As a \n19  result, although historically ORR has funded direct representation, it has done so as a matter of its \n20  exclusive discretion.  Like many discretionary policies, this one has changed with the change in \nAdministration, and ORR has now determined that it will no longer fund direct representation for UAC. \n21 \n16.  Congress periodically appropriates funds to support ORR’s UAC program, including legal \n22 \nservices.  Appropriations language, however, consistently remains broad and nonspecific regarding \n23 \nprecise funding allocations.  For example, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. \n24 \n118-47, provides general appropriations to execute activities under Section 235 of the TVPRA without \n25  earmarking explicit amounts for direct legal representation.  This general appropriation approach allows \n26  ORR flexibility in determining the allocation of resources based on agency priorities, the availability of \npro bono counsel, and shifting immigration policy needs.  Subsequent acts, including the Full-Year \n27 \nContinuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. L. No. 119-4, similarly maintain funding \n28 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 261\n4 \n   \n\n(290 of 956), Page 290 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 290 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 5 of 6\n \nlevels and provide broad discretion without altering statutory obligations or imposing specific mandates \nfor funding legal representation. \n17.  Had Acacia never entered into a contract with the United States to provide direct legal \nservices to UAC, Plaintiffs would have never received funding to provide such legal services. Under the \nFoundation Rule, HHS would maintain the discretion to determine whether to fund direct-legal services \nfor UAC, and, using that discretion, it would likely continue to decline to continue funding. Moreover,  \nwhile it has cancelled aspects of the Acacia contract pertaining to direct representation of UAC, ORR has \nnot canceled those aspects pertaining to the provision of the KYR trainings and legal screenings because \nORR’s regulations require the provision of both the KYR presentation and the legal screening.  See 45 \nCFR 410.1309(a)(2)(i) and (v).  \n18.  The termination of the Acacia contract is in the public’s best interest as almost $800 \nmillion has been spent on legal services, much of which is not legally mandated, and to continue funding \nsuch services that are not legally required does not fulfill this Administration’s policy goals of reducing \nunnecessary public expenditures. The law gives HHS discretion on how to use ORR’s funding and given \nthe priorities to reduce public expenditures, ORR has directed such funding be curtailed.  \n19.  ORR has not made any commitment or representation to Plaintiffs, including Acacia or \nany other entity involved in this case, that it would continue funding direct legal services through their \ncontracts. The decision to fund such services, if continued, remains subject to the agency’s discretion, \nappropriations, and programmatic priorities. There is no obligation under the applicable statutes or \nregulations that mandates HHS to maintain contractual relationships with specific service providers, \nincluding the Plaintiffs in this matter. \n20.  Despite the recent change in the scope of the Acacia contract, ORR will continue to ensure \nUAC in the agency’s custody are provided KYR presentations and legal screenings through the use of \nlegal service providers whether through awards or subawards. \n21.  Under the renewed contract, ACF/ORR will still pay $27,318.224.88 remaining costs to \nAcacia to provide KYR Trainings and legal screenings on a go-forward basis. \n22.  UAC have, and remain, free to retain any attorney they wish to represent them in any \nmatter they wish to contest at no cost to the Government, and Plaintiffs and any other legal service \nproviders remains free to provide direct legal services on a truly pro bono basis.

Requiring the agency to provide\n4 \ndirect representation for UAC prohibits the discretion Congress intentionally conferred upon HHS. \n5 \n24. Further, ACF/ORR is concerned that large multimillion dollar contracts create a market\n6  for paid legal service providers to take on cases, which disincentivizes the recruitment of and the \n7  volunteering of pro bono counsel. Notably, many jurisdictions require or encourage attorneys to take on \ncases for indignant clients or cases in the public interest pro bono and have annual reporting requirements \n8 \nfor attorneys to report those hours. A large influx of public funding for direct representation therefore may \n9 \nhave the perverse effect of discouraging the utilization of pro bono counsel in the first instance. \n10 \n11 \nExecuted on March 31, 2025. \n12 \n13 \n_______________________________________ \n14 \nToby Biswas \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 263\n6 \n\n(292 of 956), Page 292 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 292 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-2     Filed 03/31/25     Page 1 of 2\nExhibit 1. \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 264\n\n(293 of 956), Page 293 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 293 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-2     Filed 03/31/25     Page 2 of 2\nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 265\n\n(294 of 956), Page 294 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 294 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 24-3     Filed 03/31/25     Page 1 of 2\n   \nUnited States Department of the Interior \nINTERIOR BUSINESS CENTER \nWashington, DC 20240   \n \n \n \n \nMarch 21, 2025 \n \nTo:     Leah Prestamo \n    Acacia Center for Justice \n1025 Connecticut Avenue NW \nSuite 1000A \nWashington, DC 20036 \n \nSubject:   Notice of Partial Termination for the Government’s Convenience \n \nContract 140D0422C0009, awarded on March 29, 2022, by the United States Department of the \nInterior (DOI), Interior Business Center (IBC), Acquisition Services Directorate (AQD) on behalf of \nthe Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Administration for Children and Families \n(ACF), Office Refugee Resettlement (ORR) as a part of our Interagency Agreement for acquisition \nservices, is hereby partially terminated for the Government’s convenience.

Having considered Plaintiffs’ motion, Defendants’ response, and the arguments of \n22  the Parties at the April 1, 2025 hearing, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ emergency Motion \n23  for a Temporary Restraining Order, effective 8:00 a.m. on April 2, 2025.

The Court enters the \n2  following findings of fact and conclusions of law supporting the maintenance of status quo ante \n3  pending further briefing from the parties. \n4  I.  BACKGROUND \n5  Plaintiffs previously received funding for their work from ORR disbursed through Acacia \n6  Center for Justice.  Compl. ¶¶ 64-65; 88.  Defendants issued a letter to Acacia Center for Justice \n7  on March 21, 2025, terminating the contract line items through which HHS and ORR provided \n8  funding for counsel for unaccompanied children in immigration court.  Compl. ¶ 11; Biswas Decl., \n9  Ex. 2 (ECF 24-3, the “Cancellation Order”).  The letter ordered Plaintiffs to “immediately stop all \n10  work” on their ongoing funded representations.  Id.  Plaintiffs share the mission of ensuring legal \n11  representation for the thousands of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings \n12  throughout the country.  Compl. ¶ 102.  Congress has consistently appropriated funds for this \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  purpose, including the most recent appropriation for over $5 billion to ensure “all children . . . \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  have access to counsel in their immigration proceedings.”  Compl. ¶¶ 77-87. \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  Plaintiffs contend that the Government’s Cancellation Order violates its obligations under \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  the William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), \nd Srn \nee 17  which requires that the Government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  unaccompanied children receive legal counsel to represent them in “legal proceedings” and to \n19  “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  Pub. L. No. 110-457, § 235(c)(5), \n20  122 Stat. 5044, 5079.  Plaintiffs argue that the Cancellation Order additionally violates the \n21  Government’s obligations under ORR’s own “Foundational Rule,” which requires the \n22  Government to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal representation” to \n23  unaccompanied children if there are “available appropriations” and to ensure children receive a \n24  legal orientation, consultation with a lawyer, and ongoing access to lawyers. 45 C.F.R. \n25  § 410.1309(a) (2024).  Plaintiffs allege that Defendants’ Cancellation Order conflicts with these \n26  legal requirements and thus violates the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n27  Compl. ¶¶ 127-46. \n28 \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 270\n\n(299 of 956), Page 299 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 299 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 3 of 7\n \n1  In response to the Cancellation Order, Plaintiffs state that they are forced to choose \n2  between few harsh alternatives, including continuing to provide unfunded legal representation in \n3  the face of limited resources; cutting other vital organizational programs; laying off, furloughing, \n4  or terminating staff; or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing representation duties.  See, e.g., \n5  VAAP Decl. ¶ 21.   \n6  II.  DISCUSSION \n7  The Court has jurisdiction over Defendants and the subject matter of this action.  See \n8  Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 702.  Contrary to the Government’s assertions, this is \n9  not a contract dispute in which Plaintiffs seek money damages such that their suit belongs before \n10  the Federal Court of Claims.  Pacito v. Trump, No. 2:25-CV-255-JNW, 2025 WL 893530, at *4-7 \n11  (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025).  A temporary restraining order against Defendants, as provided \n12  below, is necessary until the Court can consider Plaintiff States’ forthcoming motion for a \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  preliminary injunction. \nCif\nt al\nicC 14  A.

Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, \n2  668 (citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, \n3  225 (2012)).  In sum, Plaintiffs have standing to bring this suit.   \n4  B.  Entitlement to Temporary Relief \n5  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 authorizes a trial court to grant a temporary restraining \n6  order “to preserve the status quo and the rights of the parties until a final judgment issues in the \n7  cause.”  See Ramos v. Wolf, 975 F.3d 872, 887 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting U.S. Philips Corp. v. KBC \n8  Bank N.V., 590 F.3d 1091, 1094 (9th Cir. 2010)).  The status quo in this context “refers not simply \n9  to any situation before the filing of a lawsuit, but instead to ‘the last uncontested status which \n10  preceded the pending controversy[.]’ ”  GoTo.com, Inc. v. Walt Disney Co., 202 F.3d 1199, 1210 \n11  (9th Cir. 2000) (quoting Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., 316 F.2d 804, 809 (9th Cir. \n12  1963)).  “The standard for issuing a temporary restraining order is identical to the standard for \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  issuing a preliminary injunction.”  Lockheed Missile & Space Co. v. Hughes Aircraft Co., 887 F. \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Supp. 1320, 1323 (N.D. Cal. 1995). \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  To obtain preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show: (1) a likelihood of \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  success on the merits, (2) a likelihood of irreparable harm to the moving party in the absence of \nd Srn \nee 17  preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in the favor of the moving party, and (4) an \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n19  (2008).  Where the government is a party, courts merge the analysis of the final two Winters \n20  factors, the balance of equities and the public interest.  Drakes Bay Oyster Co. v. Jewell, 747 F.3d \n21  1073, 1092 (9th Cir. 2014) (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  Courts “explore the \n22  relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.”  Barnes \n23  v. E-Sys., Inc. Grp. Hosp. Med. & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (internal \n24  quotation marks and citation omitted).  The Winters factors may be evaluated on a sliding scale, \n25  such that preliminary relief may be issued when the moving party demonstrates “that serious \n26  questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in the \n27  plaintiff’s favor.”  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1134-35 (9th Cir. 2011) \n28  (citation omitted). \n4 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 272\n\n(301 of 956), Page 301 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 301 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 5 of 7\n \n1  Here, the Court finds that Plaintiffs raise serious questions going to the merits.  In \n2  particular, the TVPRA requires that the government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \n3  practicable,” that all unaccompanied children receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal \n4  proceedings” and to “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. \n5  § 1232(c)(5).  The Government argues that HHS’s funding decisions under the TVPRA and the \n6  Foundational Rule remain discretionary and do not mandate funding of direct legal representation \n7  such as that provided by Plaintiffs.  But this raises a “serious question” going to the merits – \n8  whether the TVPRA requires the Government to ensure the provision of counsel for unrepresented \n9  children in immigration proceedings prior to the cancellation of funding for direct legal \n10  representation by organizations such as Plaintiffs.  This serious question weighs in favor of \n11  reinstating the status quo ante while the record and the parties’ arguments are developed further. \n12  Plaintiffs have also shown that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  preliminary relief.  Defendants’ termination of funding has impacted Plaintiffs, forcing them to \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  issue layoff notices and threatening to require them to dismiss their highly-specialized and \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  seasoned attorneys.  See ImmDef Decl. ¶¶ 20-23.  Relevant to the issue of standing raised above, \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  Defendants’ termination of funding for direct legal representation directly interferes with \nd Srn \nee 17  Plaintiffs’ missions, impeding their ability to provide the direct legal representation of \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings that is fundamental to Plaintiffs’ core \n19  activities.  RMIAN Decl. ¶ 22; VAAP Decl. ¶¶ 21-22; NWIRP ¶¶ 13-15.  The irreparable harm \n20  resulting from Defendants’ actions weighs in favor of temporary injunctive relief. \n21  The Government argues that it would suffer harm in the form of being compelled to spend \n22  down congressionally appropriated funds for the unaccompanied children in immigration \n23  proceedings during the pendency of the preliminary injunctive relief.  Not so.  Terminating \n24  funding for direct legal representation for unaccompanied children, without any plan to ensure \n25  continuity in representation, potentially violates Congress’s express directive in the TVRPA and \n26  ORR’s own commitments in the Foundational Rule.  Moreover, courts regularly find that “[t]here \n27  is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.”  League of Women \n28  Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citations omitted).  “To the \n5 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 273\n\n(302 of 956), Page 302 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 302 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 6 of 7\n \n1  contrary, there is a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the \n2  federal laws that govern their existence and operations.’ ”  Id. (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 \n3  F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)).  The Government fails to convince that it would suffer harm at \n4  this stage. \n5  On the other hand, the maintenance of funding for direct legal representation services \n6  furthers the critical public interests of ensuring children have access to legal representation and \n7  protection from human trafficking.  Indeed, ORR itself recognizes “that most unaccompanied \n8  children need legal services to resolve their immigration status and that representation appears to \n9  have a significant impact on both the court appearance rate and the outcome of cases for \n10  unaccompanied children.”  Foundational Rule, 89 Fed. Reg. 34384, 34529; see also id. at 34526 \n11  (stating ORR’s goal of “100 percent legal representation of unaccompanied children.”).  The Court \n12  additionally finds that the continued funding of legal representation for unaccompanied children \na \nrt ni\nouor 13  promotes efficiency and fairness within the immigration system.  See generally Br. for Amicus \nCif\nt al\ncC 14  Curiae Former Immigration Judges & Former Members of the Board of Immigration Appeals \ni\nstrof \nDict  15  (ECF 28).  A temporary restraining order enjoining the Cancellation Order serves the public \ns ri\net\ntatDis 16  interest. \nd Srn \nee 17  In sum, the balance of equities tips sharply toward the Plaintiffs and the public interest \nth\nnirt\nUo\nN 18  strongly weighs in favor of entering temporary relief. \n19  // \n20  // \n21  // \n22  // \n23  // \n24  // \n25  // \n26  // \n27  // \n28  // \n6 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 274\n\n(303 of 956), Page 303 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 303 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 33     Filed 04/01/25     Page 7 of 7\n \n1  III.  TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER \n2  For the foregoing reasons, the Court hereby GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motion for Temporary \n3  Restraining Order.  The Court hereby ORDERS that: \n \n4  Defendants are ENJOINED from withdrawing the services or funds \nprovided by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) as of \n5  March 20, 2025, under the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5), \n6  and ORR’s Foundational Rule, 45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4), \nparticularly ORR’s provision of funds for direct legal representation \n7  services to unaccompanied children.  This injunction precludes \ncutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its \n8  duration. \n9  The Court deems no security bond is required under Rule 65(c).

The Order \n9 \nalso enjoins Defendants from “cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding for its duration.” \n10 \nId.  \n11 \nIn Defendants’ opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion requesting the TRO, Defendants argued that the \n12 \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) only waives sovereign immunity over actions seeking relief “other \n13 \nthan monetary damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702;  see also N. Star Alaska v. United States, 14 F.3d 36, 38 (9th \n14 \nCir. 1994) (The APA “does not waive sovereign immunity for contract claims seeking equitable relief.” ) \n15 \n(cleaned up); see also RAJMP, Inc. v. United States, No. 19-CV-876 AJB (WVG), 2020 WL 905592, at \n16 \n*4 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 25, 2020) (“The Ninth Circuit has held several times that the APA does not waive \n17 \nsovereign immunity over non-monetary, contract-based claims because the Tucker Act impliedly forbids \n18 \nequitable relief.”). TRO Opp., 16 (ECF No. 24). Specifically, Defendants argued that the APA does not \n19 \nprovide a waiver of sovereign immunity in this case because the relief Plaintiffs seek is payment. TRO \n20 \nOpp., 16.   Additionally, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the Tucker Act because \n21 \nthe rights that they seek to enforce and the relief that they seek is only available to them through contract. \n22 \nTRO Opp., 18-20 (citing United States Conf. of Cath. Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, No. 1:25-CV-00465, \n23 \n2025 WL 763738, at *2, 7 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025) (holding that claim requiring the government to keep \n24 \npaying, though styled as an injunction, was “founded upon a contract” and “must be heard in Claims \n25 \nCourt.”)). Despite the fact that a TRO would require Defendants to pay funds to Plaintiffs, and that their \n26 \nonly entitlement to the funds was based on a contract, the Court ruled that “this is not a contract dispute \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 279\n30 \n\n(308 of 956), Page 308 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 308 of 956\n \n \n \n1  in which Plaintiffs seek money damages such that their suit belongs before the Federal Court of Claims,” \n2  and granted the TRO. TRO, 3. \n3  Only days after the Court issued the TRO, the Supreme Court issued a decision today that at least \n4  severely undermines this Court’s assertion of jurisdiction over this case—if it is not outright controlling \n5  here. Specifically, the Supreme Court vacated a temporary restraining order enjoining the government \n6  from terminating various education-related grants.  Dep’t of Education v. California, No. 24A910, 2025 \n7  WL 1008354, at *1 (U.S. Apr. 4, 2025) (Attached as “Ex. A”).  Like this case, the plaintiffs there filed \n8  their claims under the APA, even though they ultimately sought monetary relief under governmental \n9  contracts. Id. The Court held that the government is “likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked \n10  jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.” Id. The Court reasoned that APA does not \n11  waive sovereign immunity over cases where a statute either grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly \n12  forbids the relief which is sought, such as the Tucker Act’s implied preclusion of review over contract \n13  claims in courts other than the Court of Federal Claims. Id. (citing 5 U. S. C. § 702). It further explained \n14  that the APA does not waive sovereign immunity for suits involving monetary relief. Id. “Instead, the \n15  Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on “‘any express or implied \n16  contract with the United States.’” Id. (citing 28 U. S. C. § 1491(a)(1)).  \n17  The Supreme Court’s decision confirms that Plaintiffs cannot show that they are likely to prevail \n18  on the merits of their claims, and that this Court very likely lacked jurisdiction to issue a temporary \n19  restraining order requiring the government to pay funds, where Plaintiffs’ only entitlement to the funds \n20  was through a contract. Rather, as the Court noted, Plaintiffs here must bring their claims in the Court of \n21  Federal Claims. Id. The Supreme Court’s decision is thus an intervening change in the controlling law that \n22  warrants vacatur of this Court’s TRO. \n23  ARGUMENT \n \n24  A.  Legal Standard for Dissolving a Temporary Restraining Order. \n \n25  A party may seek dissolution of a TRO or preliminary injunction based on a material change in \n26 \nfacts or law that warrants revision or dissolution.  See Karnoski v. Trump, 926 F.3d 1180, 1198 (9th Cir. \n27 \n2019) (per curiam) (citing Sharp v. Weston, 233 F.3d 1166, 1170 (9th Cir. 2000)).  The test for dissolving \n28 \nor modifying an injunction has two parts.  The moving party must show: (1) a significant change in fact \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 280\n30 \n\n(309 of 956), Page 309 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 309 of 956\n \n \n \n1  or law; and (2) that in light of the significant change, the injunction should be dissolved or modified under \n2 \nthe legal standard that governed the issuance of the injunction in the first place.  See Karnoski, 926 F.3d \n3 \nat 1198 & n.14; Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1170.  A subsequent challenge to a preliminary injunction “must rest \n4 \non grounds that could not have been raised before.”  Alto v. Black, 738 F.3d 1111, 1120 (9th Cir. 2013) \n5 \n(citation omitted).  Here, Department of Education v. California is a significant change warranting \n6 \ndissolution, and it could not have been raised before because it was issued earlier today.  \n7 \n8  B.  Dep’t of Education v. California is a Significant Change in Law. \n9  “[E]vents have largely overtaken this litigation.”  See Martinez v. Wilson, 32 F.3d 1415, 1419 (9th \n10 \nCir. 1994).  The Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education v. California significantly shifted \n11 \nthe legal landscape governing the federal government’s authority to terminate funding, affirming the \n12 \ndiscretion of federal agencies to make funding determinations without judicial interference.  This decision \n13 \ndirectly impacts the Court’s prior issuance of the TRO in this case, as the TRO was based on a premise \n14 \nthat the government lacked discretion to terminate funding for legal representation under the TVPRA and \n15 \n16  Foundational Rule. \n17  The TRO enjoined Defendants from withdrawing ORR-funded legal representation services, based \n18 \nin part on the Court’s interpretation that the TVPRA mandates ongoing funding for legal services for \n19 \nunaccompanied children.  However, the Supreme Court’s decision clarified that federal agencies retain \n20 \nthe discretion to terminate or alter funding arrangements when they deem it necessary, particularly when \n21 \nappropriations are limited or policy priorities evolve.  Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL \n22 \n1008354, at *2 (“[T]he APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a \n23 \n24  contractual obligation to pay money[.]’”) (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 \n25 \nU. S. 204, 212 (2002)); see id. **1-2.   \n26 \nAdditionally, the Supreme Court’s ruling highlights that the Judiciary should not interfere with \n27 \nagency funding decisions absent clear statutory mandates.  Id. at **1-2.  The decision emphasized that \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 281\n30 \n\n(310 of 956), Page 310 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 310 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 7 of 10\n \n \n \n1  maintaining funding contrary to agency determinations improperly encroaches on executive discretion.  \n2 \nId.  Therefore, the significant change in controlling law established by Dep’t of Education v. California \n3 \nwarrants dissolving the TRO, as the legal basis for the Court’s prior order has been substantially \n4 \nundermined. \n5 \nC.  Dep’t of Education v. California Warrants Dissolution of the TRO. \n6 \nWhen courts assess whether a change “warrants . . . dissolution of the injunction,” the “inquiry \n7 \n8  should be guided by the same criteria that govern the issuance of a preliminary injunction.”1  Karnoski, \n9  926 F.3d at 1198 (quoting Sharp, 233 F.3d at 1170).  District courts have applied these instructions from \n10 \nKarnoski in several ways.  See Lo v. Cnty. of Siskiyou, 2022 WL 1505909, at *7 (E.D. Cal. May 12, 2022) \n11 \n(listing cases).  The Lo Court observed that one district court required the movant to show an injunction \n12 \nis unwarranted under each of the four criteria, whereas another district court concluded that the defendant \n13 \nmay prevail by disproving any one or more of the four criteria.  Id. (citing CW Baice Ltd. v. Wisdomobile \n14 \nGrp. Ltd., No. 20-03526, 2021 WL 3053147, at *4 (N.D. Cal. July 20, 2021); Index Newspapers LLC v. \n15 \n16  City of Portland, No. 20-1035, 2022 WL 72124, at *9 (D. Or. Jan. 7, 2022)).  Ultimately, the Lo Court \n17  “borrowed the terms of Karnoski,” to conclude that a district court may be “guided by” the “traditional” \n18 \nstandard for injunctive relief and “address” each part of that standard without applying the standard \n19 \nmechanically or as a checklist.  Id. (citing Karnoski, 926 F.3d at 1199, 1202) (cleaned up).  “This more \n20 \nflexible interpretation recognizes district courts’ wide discretion to ensure their injunctions are just and to \n21 \nfit  those  injunctions  to  the  evolving  circumstances  of  each  case.”    Id.  (quotations  and  internal \n22 \nmodifications omitted); see also id., at *8 (“Viewing the question in this way demonstrates why a \n23 \n24 \n25 \n \n1 Under those criteria, plaintiffs seeking preliminary injunctions must establish that: (1) they are likely to \n26 \nsucceed on the merits; (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; \n(3) the balance of equities tips in their favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest.  Winter v. Nat. \n27 \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  But “[w]here, as here, the government opposes a \npreliminary injunction, the third and fourth factors merge into one inquiry.”  Porretti v. Dzurenda, 11 F.4th \n28 \n1037, 1047 (9th Cir. 2021). \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 282\n30 \n\n(311 of 956), Page 311 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 311 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 8 of 10\n \n \n \n1  defendant who seeks to modify or dissolve an injunction should not be required to prove that each element \n2 \nof the four-part test weighs in its favor.”). \n3 \nAs applied here, Dep’t of Education v. California warrants dissolution of the TRO.  First, Plaintiffs \n4 \ncannot demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits.  The Court’s TRO was premised on the \n5 \nconclusion that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims under the APA.  TRO, 3.  \n6 \nThe Court’s TRO rested on the presumption that Plaintiffs could enforce ORR’s funding obligations \n7 \n8  through the APA.  However, under the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Department of Education v. \n9  California, such relief is explicitly unavailable, as the APA's waiver of sovereign immunity does not \n10 \nextend to enforcing contractual obligations or compelling the government to pay money. See 2025 WL \n11 \n1008354, at 2. Given that the APA provided the sole jurisdictional basis for the TRO, the Supreme Court’s \n12 \nruling eliminates Plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on the merits. \n13 \nSecond, Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate irreparable injury because any funding-related harm can be \n14 \nremedied through monetary relief in the appropriate forum.  As the Supreme Court emphasized in \n15 \n16  Department of Education, where plaintiffs retain the ability to seek reimbursement of withheld funds \n17  through an appropriate suit, the harm alleged is monetary and does not rise to the level of irreparable injury \n18 \nwarranting injunctive relief.  2025 WL 1008354, at 2.  Here, Plaintiffs’ asserted injuries stem solely from \n19 \nthe termination of funding—an injury explicitly remediable through monetary damages in the proper \n20 \nvenue, such as a claim under the Tucker Act.  Therefore, Plaintiffs fail to meet the irreparable harm \n21 \nthreshold necessary to sustain the TRO. \n22 \nMoreover, as the Supreme Court also observed, it is the government—not the Plaintiffs—that faces \n23 \n24  irreparable injury from the disbursement of funds unlikely ever to be recovered once they are disbursed.  \n25 \nDep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, at 2.  Like the plaintiffs in Dep’t of Education v. \n26 \nCalifornia, none of the Plaintiffs here “promised to return withdrawn funds should its grant termination \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 283\n30 \n\n(312 of 956), Page 312 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 312 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 9 of 10\n \n \n \n1  be reinstated,” and this Court declined to impose bond under Rule 65(c).  Id.; TRO, 7.  Thus, Plaintiffs \n2 \nfail to satisfy the irreparable harm threshold necessary to sustain the TRO. \n3 \nThird,  the  Supreme  Court’s  decision  underscores  the  government’s  significant  interest  in \n4 \nmaintaining  discretion over funding decisions to  ensure that appropriations reflect  evolving policy \n5 \npriorities and fiscal considerations.  Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, at 2. Judicial \n6 \ninterference with this discretion not only disrupts agency management of limited resources but also \n7 \n8  undermines the public interest by constraining the government's ability to effectively allocate taxpayer \n9  funds.  Given the clarity of the Supreme Court’s instruction, neither the balance of equities nor the public \n10 \ninterest favors continuation of the TRO.  On the contrary, these factors strongly support dissolving the \n11 \nTRO to align with current controlling authority. \n12 \nAlternatively, the Court should stay the TRO to prevent the government from losing funds that \n13 \nthis Court likely lacked jurisdiction to disburse.  See Dep’t of Education v. California, 2025 WL 1008354, \n14 \nat 2. For all of the same reasons explained above, in prior briefing, and now in Department of Education \n15 \n16  v. California, a stay pending potential appeal is warranted here. \n17  CONCLUSION \n18 \nThe legal basis on which the TRO rested has, as the case law puts it, evaporated.  Accordingly, the \n19 \nCourt should dissolve the TRO. Alternatively, this Court should stay the TRO pending an appeal by the \n20 \ngovernment. \n21 \n \n22 \n \n23 \n \n \n24 \n   \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  DEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO DISSOLVE TRO \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 284\n30 \n\n(313 of 956), Page 313 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 313 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38     Filed 04/04/25     Page 10 of 10\n \n \n \n1  DATED: April 4, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

The District Court’s conclusion rested on a finding \nthat respondents are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 60 \nStat. 237. On March 26, the Government filed this applica-\n-\ntended on March 24) and requested an immediate adminis-\ntrative stay.  The application was presented to JUSTICE  \nJACKSON and by her referred to the Court. \n  Although the Courts of Appeals generally lack appellate \njurisdiction over appeals from TROs, several factors counsel \nin favor of construing the District Court’s order as an ap-\npealable preliminary injunction.  Among other considera-\ntions, the District Court’s order carries many of the hall-\nmarks of a preliminary injunction.  See Sampson v. Murray, \n415 U. S. 61, 87 (1974); Abbott v. Perez, 585 U. S. 579, 594 \n(2018). Moreover, the District Court’s “basis for issuing the \norder [is] strongly challenged,” as the Government is likely  \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 288\n\n(317 of 956), Page 317 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 317 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. CALIFORNIA  \n   \nPer Curiam  \nto succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction \nto order the payment of money under the APA.   Sampson, \n415 U. S., at 87.  The APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity \ndoes not apply “if any other statute that grants consent to \nsuit  expressly  or  impliedly  forbids  the  relief  which  is \nsought.”  5 U. S. C. §702.  Nor does the waiver apply to\nclaims seeking “money damages.”  Ibid.  True, a district  \ncourt’s jurisdiction “is not barred by the possibility” that  an \norder setting aside an agency’s action may result in the dis-\nbursement of funds.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S.  \n879, 910 (1988).  But, as we have recognized, the APA’s lim-\nited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders “to en-\nforce a contractual obligation to pay money” along the lines \nof what the District Court ordered here.  Great-West Life &  \nAnnuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U. S. 204, 212 (2002).  In-\nstead, the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims \njurisdiction over suits based on “any express or implied con-\ntract with the United States.”  28 U. S. C. §1491(a)(1).\n  As for the remaining stay factors, respondents have not \nrefuted the Government’s representation that it is unlikely \nto recover the grant funds once they are disbursed.  No  \ngrantee “promised to return withdrawn funds should its \ngrant termination be reinstated,” and the District Court de-\nclined to impose bond. App. to Application To Vacate Order \n15a, 17a. By contrast, the Government compellingly argues \nthat respondents would not suffer irreparable harm while\nthe TRO is stayed.  Respondents have represented in this \nlitigation that they have the financial wherewithal to keep \ntheir programs running. So, if respondents ultimately pre-\nvail,  they  can  recover  any  wrongfully  withheld  funds \nthrough suit in an appropriate forum.  And if respondents \ninstead decline to keep the programs operating, then any \nensuing irreparable harm would be of their own making.  \n“Such self-imposed costs are not properly the subject of in-\nquiry on a motion for stay.”  Cuomo v. NRC, 772 F. 2d 972,  \n977 (CADC 1985) (per curiam).  \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 289\n\n(318 of 956), Page 318 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 318 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nPer Curiam  \n  We construe the application as seeking a stay pending \nappeal and grant the application.  The March 10, 2025 or-\nder and March 24, 2025 extension of the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, case No. 1:25– \ncv–10548, is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and \ndisposition of a petition for a writ of certiorari, if such a writ \nis timely sought. Should certiorari be denied, this stay shall \nterminate automatically. In the event certiorari is granted, \nthe stay shall terminate upon the sending down of the judg-\nment of this Court.  \n \nIt is so ordered. \n \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 290\n\n(319 of 956), Page 319 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 319 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 5 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U.

Nowhere in its papers does the Government de-\nfend the legality of canceling the education grants at issue \nhere.  And contra the per curiam, the respondent States \nhave consistently represented that the loss of these grants\nwill force them—indeed, has already forced them—to cur-\ntail teacher training programs.  See, e.g., Brief in Opposi-\ntion to Application 39–40; App. to Application To Vacate Or-\nder 7a–8a, 34a–35a.  The remaining issue is whether this \nsuit,  brought  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act\n(APA), belongs in an ordinary district court or  the Court of \nFederal Claims.  As the Court acknowledges, the general \nrule is that APA actions go to district courts, even when a \nremedial order “may result in the disbursement of funds.”  \nAnte, at 2 (citing Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U. S. 879,  \n910 (1988)).  To support a different result here, the Court \nrelies exclusively on Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v.  \nKnudson, 534 U. S. 204 (2002).  But Great-West  was not  \nbrought under the APA, as the Court took care to note. See \nid., at 212 (distinguishing Bowen for that reason).  So the  \nCourt’s reasoning is at the least under-developed, and very \npossibly wrong.\n  The  risk  of  error  increases  when  this  Court  decides  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 291\n\n(320 of 956), Page 320 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 320 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 6 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v.

And there will of course be \ngood-faith disagreements about when that is called for.  But \nin my view, nothing about this case demanded our immedi-\nate intervention.

The District Court issued a temporary restraining or-\nder (TRO) finding that the Department’s decision was likely \nunlawful and pausing the grant cancellations while the \ncourt considers a pending motion for a preliminary injunc-\ntion.  The TRO expires in three days, and it will become \nmoot even earlier if the District Court rules on the prelimi-\nnary-injunction motion this week. \n  With the TRO on its last legs, a majority of this Court has \nchosen to dive into this dispute today, allowing the Depart-\nment to implement immediately its new summary grant-\ntermination policy.   It does so  even though the TRO preserves \nthe pretermination status quo and causes zero concrete  \nharm to the Government.  By  contrast, reinstating the chal-\nlenged grant-termination policy will inflict significant harm \non grantees—a fact that the Government barely contests.  \nWorse still, the Government does not even deign to defend \nthe lawfulness of its actions.  Instead, it asks us to superin-\ntend the lower courts’ real-time decisions about ancillary \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 293\n\n(322 of 956), Page 322 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 322 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 8 of 23\n2  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v.

It is like-\nwise baffling that anyone is persuaded that the equities fa-\nvor the Government when the Government does not even  \nargue that the lower courts erred in concluding that it likely \nbehaved unlawfully. This application should have been de-\nnied for numerous obvious and independent reasons, and \nthe Court does itself—and the legal process—no favors in \ndeciding to grant it.  \nI \nA \n  To address a nationwide shortage of qualified teachers, \nCongress has enacted several competitive grant programs \nthat facilitate the recruitment, training, and support of ed-\nucators. This application concerns the Department’s recent \nefforts to terminate grants that were awarded under two \nsuch programs: the Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) pro-\ngram and the Supporting Effective Educator  Development \n(SEED) program. \n  Congress established the TQP program in 2008, author-\nizing the Department to award grants to high-need educa-\ntional  agencies  and  schools  for  the  purpose  of  training \nteachers.  20  U. S. C.  §§1021(6),  1022a(a),  1022a(c)(1), \n1022h.  In the statute that creates this program, Congress \nmade plain its intent to (1) “improve student achievement,” \n “improve the quality of . . . teachers,” (3) “hold teacher \npreparation programs at institutions of higher education \naccountable,” and (4) “recruit highly qualified individuals, \nincluding minorities and individuals from other occupa-\ntions, into the teaching force.”  §1022.\n  By  statute,  the  Department  awards  each  TQP  grant \nbased on a peer-review process “for a period of five years.”   \n§§1022b(a), (b)(3).  Similarly, under the SEED program, \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 294\n\n(323 of 956), Page 323 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 323 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 9 of 23\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nCongress has mandated that the Department “shall award \ngrants” to institutions of higher education and nonprofit en-\ntities that provide certain education-related services, in-\ncluding “evidence-based professional development activi-\nties” for teachers. §§6672(a)(2), (f ).  Congress dictated that \n \nSEED grants “shall be” awarded for up to a 3-year period, \nsubject to a possible 2-year extension.  §§6672(b)(1)–(2). \n  On February 5, 2025, the Acting Secretary of Education is-\nsued an internal directive requiring Department personnel \nto review “‘issued grants’” to “‘ensur[e] that Department \n     \ngrants do not fund discriminatory practices’” that are “‘con-\n   \ntrary to law or to the Department’s policy objectives’” and \n \nthat “‘all grants are free from fraud, abuse, and duplica-\n \ntion.’”  App. to Application To Vacate Order 12a (App.).  The  \n \ndirective expressly extends to “‘practices . . . in the form of \n \n[diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”)].’”  Ibid. (alteration\n \nin original). \n  Two days later, TQP and SEED grant recipients began to \nreceive letters from the Department announcing the termi\nnation of their grant awards.  The letters were identical,  \nsave for differences in the addressees, grant-award num-\nbers, and termination dates.  Each letter included a single \nparagraph regarding the Department’s justification for the \ngrant termination, which stated, in full, as follows: \n“‘The grant specified above provides funding for pro-\n \ngrams that promote or take part in DEI initiatives or \nother initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or an-\nother protected characteristic; that violate either the \nletter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that con-\nflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education; that are not free \nfrom fraud, abuse, or duplication; or that otherwise fail \nto serve the best interests of the United States.

See 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4); see also \n34 C.F.R. 75.253.”  Id., at 36–37. \nB \n  On March 6, 2025, eight States sued the Department in \nthe  District  of  Massachusetts,  claiming  that  this  mass,\nsummary termination of TQP and SEED grants was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, and not in accordance with law, in vi-\nolation  of  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  (APA).  \n5 U. S. C. §706(2)(A).  The Plaintiff States alleged that, as \na result of the grant terminations, their public universities, \nschools, and other institutions “now face abrupt shortfalls \nto their current year budgets collectively exceeding ten mil-\nlion dollars.”   ECF Doc. 1, at 41.  As relevant, the Plaintiff \nStates sought declaratory and injunctive relief to set aside \nthe termination of the previously awarded grants.  They \nalso sought a TRO to immediately block termination of the \ngrants. \n  After holding a 2-hour hearing, the District Court issued \na TRO on March 10.

Supp. 3d ___, ___–___ (Mass. 2025), App. 9a– \n10a.  The order also contained an exception permitting the \nDepartment to make individual grant terminations con-\nsistent with applicable law and regulations. \n  By its terms, the TRO was “effective immediately” and \nwould “remain in effect for 14 days,” until March 24.  Id., at \n10a.  The District Court then separately construed the \nPlaintiff States’ TRO motion as a motion for a preliminary \ninjunction and set that motion for a hearing on March 28.  \nThe District Court subsequently extended the TRO for an \nadditional 14 days, until April 7, while also expressing its\n“intent that the TRO be temporary and short.”  ECF Doc.  \n79. \n  Seeking to enforce its termination decisions during the \nperiod in which the TRO remained in effect, the Govern-\nment requested a stay pending appeal.  The District Court \ndenied the request, as did a unanimous panel of the First \nCircuit.  The First Circuit panel assumed without deciding \nthat it had jurisdiction to review the TRO and  made several \ndeterminations, including: that the States were likely to \nsucceed on the merits of their claim that the Department’s \ntermination of the grants was arbitrary and capricious; that \nthe Government’s assertions of irreparable harm consisted \nof “speculation and hyperbole”; and that the equitable stay \nfactors cut against the Government.  ___ F. 4th ___, ___–___ \n(2025), App. 24a–35a.  The Government then turned to us \nfor an emergency stay. \nII  \n  First and foremost, the Government’s application should \nhave been swiftly denied because this Court lacks jurisdic-\ntion over this interlocutory order.  It is clear beyond cavil  \nthat, ordinarily, “orders granting . . . temporary restraining  \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 297\n\n(326 of 956), Page 326 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 326 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 38-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 12 of 23\n6  DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION v. CALIFORNIA  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \norders are not appealable.”  16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. \nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure §3922.1 (3d ed. \n2012).  This Court has recognized an exception for TROs \nand other interlocutory orders that are “potentially unlim-\nited” in duration, Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 87 \n(1974), and risk imposing a “‘serious, perhaps irreparable, \n \nconsequence,’” Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S.  \n \n79, 84 (1981).  But this time-limited TRO presents no such  \nthreat.  \n  To start, the District Court has merely ordered restora-\ntion of the “pre-existing status quo prior to the termination” \nof the grants in the Plaintiff States.  App. 9a.  Its order \ncomes in the form of an injunction only insofar as it has pro-\nhibited the Government from implementing the abruptly\nannounced terminations—the District Court has not or-\ndered that the Government do anything other than what \nwas required by law before the termination letters issued. \n  Notably, the TRO also includes an exception that permits \nthe  Government  to  make  individual  grant  terminations \nwhile the order is in effect “to the extent the final agency \naction is consistent with Congressional authorization and \nappropriations, relevant federal statute[s], including the \nrequirements of the APA, the requirements of the relevant \nimplementing regulations, [and] the grant terms and con-\nditions.”  Id., at 10a.

Quite to the contrary, the fact that  \nthe District Court construed the Plaintiff States’ TRO mo-\ntion as a motion for a  preliminary injunction, and has al-\nready held a hearing, indicates that the court is moving \nwith dispatch and is in no way attempting to shield its in-\nterim order from appellate review.\n  This TRO thus falls squarely within the “general congres-\nIII  \n  Even assuming that the TRO is reviewable on appeal, the \nGovernment’s application does not demonstrate the sort of \nexigency that warrants emergency relief—what I have else-\nwhere called a “line-jumping justification,” Labrador v.

Even if the Government is  \nright about the merits of the arguments it raises in this ap-\nplication (which is doubtful), there is no reason why the \nGovernment cannot proceed through the usual litigation \nand appeals process to receive its vindication, as other liti-\ngants must.  To reiterate, the TRO expires  in  three days,  \nand the District Court held  a hearing on the Plaintiff \nStates’  preliminary-injunction motion a week ago.  The \nonly hint of urgency that the Government offers to justify \nits unusual request for our intervention is that, during the \nwaning  days  of  the  TRO  period,  some  grant  recipients \nmight seek to draw down grant funds that the Government \nwants to terminate. \n  If true, that would be unfortunate, but worse things have \nhappened.

It is likely \nthat, given the Department’s new policy position with re-\nspect to terminations, it will be extra vigilant about record-\ning any withdrawals made while the TRO is in effect, so  \nthat the money can be clawed back if appropriate.  Thus,  \nthe alleged funding drain at which the Government ges-\ntures does not even appear to be irreparable.  The Govern-\nment has certainly not met its burden to show otherwise.  \nSee Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.

CALIFORNIA  \n   \nJACKSON,  J., dissenting  \nIV \n  To review, the Court has now granted the Government’s \nrequest for “emergency” relief, staying a TRO that will ex-\npire in just three days in a case where appellate jurisdiction \nis wanting and the Government’s assertions of harm are il-\nlusory.  One might reasonably assume that, for the Su-\npreme Court of the United States to step in and grant relief \nin this posture, the applicant would have at least presented\na rock-solid argument in support of its underlying merits \nposition.  Thus, here, one would expect the Government to \nvigorously maintain that the Department was legally enti-\ntled to all but eliminate two grant programs that Congress \nestablished a decade ago.  But in this Court, the Govern-\nment offers no defense against the Plaintiff States’ claim \nthat the Department’s erasure of the grants at issue was \narbitrary and capricious. Instead, the Government raises \nseveral threshold and remedial questions about the scope of \nthe District Court’s power to review the Government’s al-\nlegedly unlawful conduct.2  \n  The Government’s request for emergency relief from this \nCourt—without presenting any defense as to the merits of \nthe Plaintiff States’ arbitrary-and-capricious challenge—is\nstriking.  And the Court now blesses this strategic decision \nto sidestep the underlying merits by reinstating grant ter-\nminations that both lower courts have said are likely un-\nlawful.  This seems like a development in our practices re-\nlated  to  emergency  applications  that,  at  a  minimum, \nrequires further exploration.  If the emergency docket has \nnow become a vehicle for certain defendants to obtain this \n—————— \n2To be specific, the Government argues that the lawfulness of the ter-\n \nminations is irrelevant for present purposes because (1) the Court of Fed\neral Claims, not the District  Court, has original jurisdiction over this dis-\npute; (2) the Department’s grant-termination decisions are “committed \nto agency discretion by law” and thus  not reviewable under the APA, 5 \nU.

In an appeals sys-\ntem that is supposed to provide prompt resolution of all  le-\ngal challenges, this new avenue for piecemeal interlocutory\nreview enables strategic delay and facilitates obfuscation of \nthe weaknesses of the defendant’s merits positions. \nA \n  Take this case, for example.

Chenery Corp., 332 U. S. 194, \n196–197 (1947).  Moreover, the agency’s abruptness  leaves \none wondering whether any reasoned decisionmaking  has \noccurred with respect  to  these terminations at all.3   These  \nare precisely the kinds of concerns that the APA’s bar on \narbitrary-and-capricious  agency  decisionmaking  was \nmeant to address. See Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.

As explained more fully in the accompanying \n16  memorandum, a reasonable person would likely question Judge Martínez-Olguín’s impartiality, and \n17  accordingly, recusal is required under 28 U.S.C. § 455(a). In addition, due to Judge Martínez-Olguín’s \n18  experience as a managing attorney at CLSEPA, she likely has personal knowledge of the irreparable harm \n19  that CLSEPA is alleging, which is a disputed fact in this proceeding. Thus, recusal is also required under \n20  28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1). \n21   \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 311\n\n(340 of 956), Page 340 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 340 of 956\n \n \n \n1  DATED: April 9, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n2   \nYAAKOV M.

In this \n5 \n6  involving President Trump’s determinations on the appropriate expenditure of resources related to \n7  various immigration-related priorities. \n8  Although recusal under 28 U.S.C. § 455 is normally undertaken by a judge sua sponte, counsel \n9  may bring the issue to a Judge’s attention by formal motion or raise it informally.1 Local Civil Rule 3 –\n10  14 Commentary. Recusal is required in this case for at least three reasons. First, Judge Martínez-Olguín \n11  was previously employed as a managing attorney by the lead Plaintiff in this case, Community Legal \n12  Services in East Palo Alto (CLSEPA), so a reasonable person would likely question her impartiality. 28 \n13  U.S.C. § 455(a). Second, Judge Martínez-Olguín has made various statements critical of President \n14  Trump’s immigration agenda, further underscoring the appearance of partiality in this case. And third, \n15  given Judge Martínez-Olguín’s likely knowledge about CLSEPA’s budget and organization, she \n16  presumably has personal knowledge regarding the irreparable harm that CLSEPA alleges it will suffer \n17  absent federal funding, an issue that is contested in this case. Because she likely has personal knowledge \n18  about a disputed fact, 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(1) mandates recusal.  \n19  Defendants therefore respectfully request that Judge Martínez-Olguín recuse herself from \n20  presiding over this case, vacate the injunctive relief entered, and reassign the case to a different judge \n21  whose impartiality would not be questioned.  \n22  STATEMENT OF RELEVANT FACTS \n \n23    From 2017 to 2018, Judge Martínez-Olguín was an attorney at CLSEPA. See Araceli Martínez-\n24  Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, at 2, \n25 \n \n1 Additionally, under California Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(f), a lawyer engages in \n26 \n“professional misconduct” if she “knowingly assist[s], solicit[s], or induce[s] a judge or judicial officer \nin conduct that is a violation of an applicable code of judicial ethics or code of judicial conduct, or other \n27 \nlaw.”  Cal. Rules of Prof’l Conduct R. 8.4(f). Because no disclosures about possible conflicts of interest \nwere made at the start of litigation, counsel for Defendants bring these issues to the Court’s attention \n28 \nnow. \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  1  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 313\n\n(342 of 956), Page 342 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 342 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 5 of 12\n \n \n \n1  https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Martínez-Olguín%20SJQ%20Public%20Final.pdf (last \n2  accessed Apr. 8, 2025). Specifically, in 2017, she was employed as a Senior Immigrants’ Rights \n3  Attorney and, in 2018, she was the “Managing Attorney” of CLSEPA’s Immigrant Rights’ Project. Id. \n4  In 2018, Judge Martínez-Olguín began her career at the National Immigration Law Center, where she \n5  was a staff attorney from 2018 to 2020 and then a Supervising Attorney from 2020 until her nomination \n6  to the federal judiciary. Id. Notably, during her time at National Immigration Law Center, Judge \n7  Martínez-Olguín represented a class of individuals who were eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood \n8  Arrivals (DACA). Id. at 31. One of her co-counsel for that case was Karen C. Tumlin. Id. In February \n9  2023, Judge Martínez-Olguín was confirmed as Judge for the Northern District of California.  \n10    On March 26, 2025, Plaintiff CLSEPA and other similar organizations filed this lawsuit \n11  challenging the government’s decision to withhold funding for direct legal services for unaccompanied \n12  alien children. See ECF No. 1. Plaintiffs are represented by Judge Martinez-Olguin’s former employer, \n13  National Immigration Law Center, and Karen Tumlin, among others. The following day, Plaintiffs \n14  moved for a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO). ECF No. 7. The Court ordered the government to file \n15  a response to the TRO motion by noon on March 31, 2025. ECF No. 17. The government filed its \n16  opposition accordingly. ECF No. 24. The next day, hours after a hearing on the TRO motion, the Court \n17  granted Plaintiffs’ TRO Motion. ECF No. 33.  \n18  LEGAL STANDARD \n19  Recusal is mandatory where a judge’s “impartiality might reasonably be questioned.” 28 U.S.C. \n20  § 455(a) (explaining that a federal judge “shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his \n21  impartiality might reasonably be questioned”). Recusal under this subsection is appropriate where a \n22  “reasonable person with knowledge of all the facts would conclude that the judge’s impartiality might \n23  reasonably be in question.” Yagman v. Republic Ins., 987 F.2d 622, 626 (9th Cir. 1993). That standard is \n24  an objective one; the “reasonable person” for this inquiry is not “someone who is ‘hypersensitive or \n25  unduly suspicious,’ but rather is a ‘well-informed, thoughtful observer.’” United States v. Holland, 519 \n26  F.3d 909, 913 (9th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). Whether a reasonable person would question a judge’s \n27  impartiality is not based on one single factor, but on the “totality of the circumstances.” See Yagman, \n28  987 F.2d at 626 (impartiality might be reasonably questioned considering “all the facts.”); see also Doe \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  2  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 314\n\n(343 of 956), Page 343 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 343 of 956\n \n \n \n1  v. Cabrera, 134 F. Supp. 3d 439, 450 (D.D.C. 2015) (looking to the “totality of the circumstances” to \n2  determine whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality). \n3  The touchstone for recusal under Section 455(a) is “not the reality of bias or prejudice but its \n4  appearance.” Liteky v. United States, 510 U.S. 540, 548 (1994). “The very purpose of § 455(a) is to \n5  promote confidence in the judiciary by avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever \n6  possible.” United States v. Patti, 337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir. 2003) (quoting Liljeberg v. Health \n7  Servs. Acquisition Corp., 486 U.S. 847, 865 (1988)). Thus, “any doubts must be resolved in favor of \n8  recusal.” Id.; see also Parker v. Connors Steel Co., 855 F.2d 1510, 1524 (11th Cir. 1988) (“It has been \n9  stated on numerous occasions that when a judge harbors any doubts concerning whether his \n10  disqualification is required he should resolve the doubt in favor of disqualification.”). \n11  A judge also “shall” recuse where she has “personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts \n12  concerning the proceeding” or “has a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party.” 28 U.S.C. \n13  § 455(b)(1). Unlike 455(a), if one of the provisions of section 455(b) applies, then disqualification is \n14  mandatory regardless of whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality. Liljeberg, \n15  486 U.S. at 859 n. 8. Section 455(b) applies a subjective standard for the judge to determine whether he \n16  or she can be truly impartial when trying the case. If the judge believes there is a risk of prejudice, it is \n17  “incumbent on him to recuse himself from the case as failure to do so would amount to an abdication of \n18  duty” and would be “in clear derogation of the solemn promise he made when he took his oath of \n19  office.”  United States v. Holland, 519 F.3d 909, 915 (9th Cir. 2008). \n20  DISCUSSION \n21  There is little doubt that a reasonable person would question Judge Martínez-Olguín’s \n22  impartiality in this case. CLSEPA is the lead Plaintiff in the case, yet Judge Martínez-Olguín served as \n23  CLSEPA’s managing attorney within Plaintiff’s organizations from 2017-2018. In this role, Judge \n24  Martínez-Olguín established and ran the Immigration Rights project where she “identified issues for \n25  local or state policy advocacy and impact litigation, engaged in community education, and provided \n26  advice and counsel to community groups.” Araceli Martínez-Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial \n27  Nominees, at 24, https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Martínez-\n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  3  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 315\n\n(344 of 956), Page 344 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 344 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 7 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Olguín was part of CLSEPA’s management team, where she set and implemented policies and practices. \n2  Id. at 48.  \n3  The conflicts created by Judge Martínez-Olguín’s affiliation with the lead Plaintiff is \n4  unavoidable. Judge Martínez-Olguín held senior roles for at least one of the litigating parties; her \n5  connection to the Plaintiffs is too substantial for a reasonable person to ignore or minimize the risk of \n6  impropriety. Further underscoring the close entwinement between CLSEPA and Judge Martínez-Olguín, \n7  upon her elevation to the bench in 2023, CLSEPA posted a public Facebook post celebrating that \n8  “former CLSEPA attorney Araceli Martínez-Olguín ha[d] been confirmed as a U.S. district judge.” \n9  Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto, Facebook (Mar. 6, 2023), https://tinyurl.com/58nhrsna. \n10  Indeed, at least one media outlet has noted the previous employment relationship between Judge \n11  Martínez-Olguín and CLSEPA and has suggested that her recusal may be necessary. See Chuck Ross, \n12  Federal Judge Orders Trump Admin To Resume Funding Left-Wing Immigration Groups—Including \n13 \n14  administration/federal-judge-orders-trump-admin-to-resume-funding-left-wing-immigration-groups-\n15  including-her-former-employer (“Martínez-Olguín’s work for one of the plaintiffs in the litigation could \n16  lead to calls for her recusal from the case.”). Recusal is thus warranted because the public would \n17  reasonably question her ability to be impartial. The responsibility of the Court is not only to be fair and \n18  impartial but to appear fair and impartial to the public.  \n19  Beyond her affiliation with CLSEPA, Judge Martínez-Olguín has not kept her disdain for \n20  President Trump quiet. Instead, she has voiced her political views both inside and outside the courtroom. \n21  In various past statements made in her capacity as an immigrant-rights advocate, Judge Martínez-Olguín \n22  described President Trump’s immigration policies implicating minor aliens as “unlawful and cruel,” \n23  National Immigration Law Center, Facebook (Nov. 12, 2019), https://tinyurl.com/5c8jjmr3, and she \n24  further rebuked President Trump for his views on various immigration issues, e.g., Trump admin \n25  proposal would hike fees for immigration applications, impose asylum charge, CBS News (Nov. 17, \n26  2019), https://tinyurl.com/cnp7urvt. In other public fora, Judge Martínez-Olguín criticized Trump \n27  “administration efforts to chip away at DACA” and disclaimed the INA’s various jurisdictional \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  4  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 316\n\n(345 of 956), Page 345 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 345 of 956\n \n \n \n1  boundaries to judicial review of President Trump’s immigration efforts. ACS Los Angeles 2019-2020 \n2  Supreme Court Review (Aug. 11, 2020), https://tinyurl.com/2kxe8jcc. \n3  Those statements are directly germane to the issues Judge Martínez-Olguín is presiding over and \n4  therefore would give a reasonable person pause as to whether she can be impartial. The instant case \n5  involves the government’s decision to discontinue providing direct legal services to unaccompanied \n6  alien children. Plaintiffs filed a Motion for a TRO citing irreparable harm to their organization if the \n7  funding stops. See Decl. of Marth Ruch, Lead Immigration Managing Attorney, CLSEPA, ECF No. 7-\n8  16 ¶ 5 (attesting that “[w]ith [HHS] funding, CLSEPA employs six staff members dedicated to \n9  providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children,” and that representation of \n10  unaccompanied children makes up a significant portion of the six staff members’ case work). And \n11  Defendants raised jurisdictional defects with Plaintiffs’ claims that the court rejected outright. See Def’s \n12  Opp, ECF 24, at 1, 10–12. (Mar. 31, 2025). \n13  In addition to her prior role as managing attorney for a party in this case and her professional \n14  background, Judge Martínez-Olguín also has a relationship with the attorneys representing Plaintiffs in \n15  this case. One of the organizations representing Plaintiffs is the National Immigration Law Center, \n16  where Judge Martínez-Olguín worked as an attorney up until her confirmation as a district-court judge. \n17  In her Senate Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, she noted that “potential conflicts of interest could \n18  be presented in matters being litigated before me by the lawyers from the National Immigration Law \n19  Center. If a conflict were to arise, I would immediately recuse myself from the matter.” Araceli \n20  Martínez-Olguín, Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, at 50, \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  5  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 317\n\n(346 of 956), Page 346 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 346 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 9 of 12\n \n \n \n1  Tumlin represented a class of individuals who qualified for DACA, challenging the first Trump \n2  Administration’s decision to restrict the DACA program. See Batalla Vidal v. Wolf, No. \n3  16CV4756NGGVMS, 2020 WL 7121849, at *1 (E.D.N.Y. Dec. 4, 2020) (explaining the background of \n4  the case). Similarly, Judge Martínez-Olguín represented DACA recipients alongside Ms. Tumlin in \n5  Arizona Dream Act Coalition v. Brewer, 12-cv-2546 (D. Ariz.). While her representation alongside \n6  Plaintiff’s counsel in other cases involving foreign-national children may not be sufficient to create an \n7  appearance of bias by itself, considering the totality of the circumstances—including her previous \n8  employment with Plaintiff CLSEPA and relationship with National Immigration Law Center—a \n9  reasonable person would question Judge Martínez-Olguín's impartiality here. See Yagman, 987 F.2d at \n10  626; see also Doe, 134 F. Supp. 3d at 450 (looking to the “totality of the circumstances” to determine \n11  whether a reasonable person would question the judge’s impartiality). \n12  Overall, a reasonable person would question whether a former managing attorney could be \n13  impartial when deciding whether her previous employer and employees, represented by her former co-\n14  counsel, will be irreparably harmed by a President’s policies that the Judge has criticized in the public \n15  square as an advocate. That appearance of impropriety mandates recusal. \n16  Beyond positional conflicts, Judge Martínez-Olguín should recuse because she, as a former \n17  managing attorney at Plaintiff CLSEPA, very likely has personal knowledge of the organization’s \n18  budget and operations and therefore has personal knowledge about CLSEPA’s allegations regarding \n19  irreparable harm—a disputed fact in this case. Judge Martínez-Olguín presumably has personal \n20  knowledge about how CLSEPA obtains funding, its budget considerations, and its financial dependency \n21  upon funding from the federal government. ECF 7-16 at 6. If Judge Martínez-Olguín does, in fact, \n22  possess such knowledge based on her previous experience, her recusal is required by law. 28 U.S.C. \n23  § 455(b)(1). \n24  CONCLUSION \n25 \nDefendants deserve a court proceeding free from concerns about impartiality. To remove the \n26 \npossibility of any impartiality to these proceedings and to maintain the public’s confidence in the judicial \n27 \nsystem, Defendants respectfully request that this Court recuse itself and return this matter to assignment \n28 \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION FOR RECUSAL AND REASSIGNMENT \n3:25-CV-02847- AMO  6  PI Appeal and Stay Addendum 318\n\n(347 of 956), Page 347 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 347 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 47     Filed 04/09/25     Page 10 of 12\n \n \n \n1  before a judge who does not have a personal connection to a party or counsel in this case.

On March 21, 2025, despite the existence of congressionally appropriated funds \nfor this purpose, Defendants abruptly terminated long-standing funding for direct representation \nfor unaccompanied children.  On April 1, 2025, the Court issued a temporary restraining order to \nprotect Plaintiffs until the Court rules on this motion, enjoining Defendants from “withdrawing the \nservices or funds” Defendants provided under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule as of March 20, \n2025, and precluding Defendants from “cutting off access to congressionally appropriated funding \nfor its duration.”  Plaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction preserving the status quo and \nextending the Court’s temporary restraining order through the resolution of this case. \nThe motion is based upon this notice of motion; the memorandum of points and authorities \nin support thereof that follows; the declarations of  Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu, Daniela Hernández \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \ni \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 326\n \n\n(355 of 956), Page 355 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 355 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 36\n     \n \nChong Cuy, Jill Martin Diaz,  Ana Raquel Devereaux, Marion Donovan Kaloust, Miguel Angel \nMexicano  Furmanska,  Vanessa  Gutierrez,  Ashley  T.

Absent intervention from legal services providers, they must \nnavigate our country’s complicated immigration processes alone.  Plaintiffs are a group of legal \nservices providers dedicated to providing legal support to these children.  In furtherance of their \nmissions, Plaintiffs provide congressionally mandated direct representation and services to UCs. \nIn 2008, recognizing that children navigating complicated legal proceedings need counsel, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) by statute to “ensure, to \nthe greatest extent practicable . . . , that all unaccompanied alien children . . . have counsel to \nrepresent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, \nand trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (the “TVPRA”).  Under this mandate, Congress has funded \ndirect representation for UCs since 2012.  In 2024, confirming its responsibility to provide these \ncongressionally  mandated legal services, ORR issued its Unaccompanied Children Program \nFoundational Rule (“Foundational Rule”) and bound itself to funding legal services providers, so \nlong as congressional appropriations are available.  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  Congress has \nappropriated funding through September 30, 2027. \nDespite these congressional and regulatory mandates, on March 21, 2025, Defendants \nabruptly cut funding for the legal representation and other legal services work, including friend of \ncourt services assisting UCs in immigration court and efforts to refer UCs whom Plaintiffs could \nnot represent to pro bono attorneys, in clear violation of the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”).  For brevity, Plaintiffs use “direct representation” throughout to refer to the legal services \ncancelled by Defendants.  Defendants provided Plaintiffs no information about how Plaintiffs \nshould address their ongoing commitments to represent UCs (including UCs with immigration \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 335\n \n\n(364 of 956), Page 364 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 364 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 12 of 36\n     \n \ncourt dates in the coming days) or about how Defendants intended to comply with their obligations \nto provide direct representation to UCs to the greatest extent practicable.   \nPlaintiffs’ missions are to ensure immigrants in the United States—particularly UCs—have \nlegal support and do not face the immigration system alone.  To that end, Plaintiffs collectively \nrepresent thousands of UCs through funding from Defendants mandated by the TVPRA and \nFoundational Rule.  By refusing to fund direct representation for UCs, in violation of these \nmandates, Defendants put Plaintiffs in an impossible position: Plaintiffs’ missions and ethical \nduties compel them to continue legal representation of UC clients.  Although doing so without \nfederal funding may ultimately bankrupt Plaintiffs, to do otherwise would betray their core \nmissions and ethical obligations to their clients.  The Court can (and should) redress this harm by \nissuing an injunction ordering Defendants to meet TVPRA and regulatory requirements to fund \ndirect representation, as the Court temporarily did with its current TRO.   \nDefendants’ actions contravene congressional and regulatory mandate and are arbitrary and \ncapricious.  They also violate this Court’s temporary restraining order.  To prevent irreparable \nharm to Plaintiffs, to say nothing of irreparable harm to their UC clients, this Court should issue a \npreliminary injunction, enjoining Defendants through the resolution of this case from cutting off \nfunding for direct representation required under the TVPRA and Foundational Rule. \nBACKGROUND \nPlaintiffs refer the Court to their Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order for a full \nfactual background.  See Dkt. 7 at 11-17.  On those facts, the Court issued a temporary restraining \norder  on  April  1,  2025  (the  “Order”),  commanding  Defendants  to  fund  required  direct \nrepresentation for UCs through April 16, 2025.  See Dkt. 33 at 1-2.  Although Defendants stated \nthey “are in receipt of the Court’s order and are taking steps to comply expeditiously,” Amica \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 336\n \n\n(365 of 956), Page 365 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 365 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 13 of 36\n     \n \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 13, as of this filing, Plaintiffs are not aware of any actual steps Defendants have \ntaken to comply.  Id. ¶ 15.  Plaintiffs intend to move to enforce compliance with the Order.    \nFurther, on April 2, 2025, Defendants said they would not produce the administrative \nrecord until the latest time permitted by the Local Rules: with Defendants’ answer.  Id. ¶ 14. \nFinally, Plaintiffs wish to clarify the state of the contract between Defendants and Acacia, \nwhich Defendants partially cancelled on March 21, 2025, given Defendants’ incorrect indication \nat the April 1, 2025, hearing that there was no contract in place at all.  The Cancellation Order \ncancelled three of the four contract “line items,” leaving only the first line item (“know your rights” \npresentations and legal consultations).  See Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 3.  The contract was due to expire March \n29, 2025, but Defendants issued a six-month extension for the first line item.  See Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 11. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA preliminary injunction is warranted when plaintiffs establish: (1) likelihood of success \non the merits; (2) irreparable harm; (3) the balance of equities favors them; and (4) an injunction \nis in the public interest.  All. for the Wild Rockies v. Cottrell, 632 F.3d 1127, 1131 (9th Cir. 2011) \n(citing Winter v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).  When the government is the \ndefendant, the last two factors merge.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  The Ninth \nCircuit uses the “serious questions” test, which allows the court to evaluate the Winter test on “a \n‘sliding scale’ . . .  under which a party is entitled to a preliminary injunction if it demonstrates \n(1) ‘serious questions going to the merits,’ (2) ‘a likelihood of irreparable injury,’ (3) ‘a balance \nof hardships that tips sharply towards the plaintiff,’ and (4) ‘the injunction is in the public \ninterest.’” Flathead-Lolo-Bitterroot Citizen Task Force v. Montana, 98 F.4th 1180, 1190 (9th Cir. \n2024) (citing All. for the Wild Rockies v. Pena, 865 F.3d 1211, 1217 (9th Cir. 2017)).  This \n“standard is ‘a lesser showing than likelihood of success on the merits.’”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n3 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 337\n \n\n(366 of 956), Page 366 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 366 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 14 of 36\n     \n \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs are Likely to Succeed on the Merits \nAgency action cannot stand if it is contrary to law or if it is arbitrary and capricious.  \nBecause Defendants’ termination of direct representation services is contrary to the TVPRA and \nORR’s  own  regulations  and  is  also  arbitrary  and  capricious,  Plaintiffs  have,  at  minimum, \ndemonstrated serious questions going to the merits and are likely to succeed on the merits. \nA.  Plaintiffs Have Standing to Bring Their Claims and Their Claims are Redressable. \nThe Court has found Plaintiffs fall within the “zone of interests” of the TVPRA and have \narticulated harms that can be redressed by this Court.  Defendants’ assertions otherwise remain \nmeritless, and the Court can and should reject them again. \nPrudential standing:  As the Court already found, Plaintiffs have prudential standing \nbecause their APA claims are in the zone of interests protected by the TVPRA.  See Dkt. 33 at 3-\n4.  While Defendants insist the injury Plaintiffs plead is entirely financial, Plaintiffs face harms to \ntheir core activities and organizational missions, including their commitment to ensuring UCs are \nnot left to navigate the immigration system alone.  See e.g., Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 2; ImmDef \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 2; FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5.  These interests are at least “‘marginally related to’ \nand ‘arguably within’ the scope of” the TVPRA, E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d \n640, 668 (9th Cir. 2021) (citing Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. \nPatchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224–-25 (2012)), as well as Congress’s interest in “ensuring, to the greatest \nextent practicable” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and \nto “protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.” 8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5). \nRedressability:  Plaintiffs’ core business activities and organizational missions—which \ninclude ensuring UCs have legal representation—have been critically and irreparably harmed by \nDefendant’s actions.  The requested injunctive relief will redress these harms.  While Defendants \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n4 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 338\n \n\n(367 of 956), Page 367 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 367 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 15 of 36\n     \n \nhave  latitude  to  determine  the  mechanism  by  which  they  comply  with  the  TVPRA  and \nFoundational Rule—whether via reviving the terminated portions of the contract or  another \nmethod of funding direct representation, either approach significantly increases the likelihood \nPlaintiffs will obtain relief from their harms. See Meese v. Keene, 481 U.S. 465, 476-77 (1987). \nThe showing required for the redressability prong of Article III standing is modest.  See \nRenee v. Duncan, 686 F.3d 1002, 1013 (9th Cir. 2012).  It is sufficient for Plaintiffs to demonstrate \na “significant increase in the likelihood” that they will obtain relief redressing their injury as a \n“practical consequence” of an order from the court.  Id.  The reinstatement of required funding for \ndirect representation to UCs significantly increases the likelihood that Plaintiffs will obtain relief, \neither through funding to continue their own representations or an alternative plan providing legal \nrepresentation  to  UCs  consistent  with  congressional  appropriations,  the  TVPRA,  and  the \nFoundational Rule. The requested injunctive relief is extremely likely to ensure that Plaintiffs’ \nclients maintain representation—as Plaintiffs’ missions demand—without forcing Plaintiffs to \ndivert resources from other mission critical initiatives.  \nThe TVPRA’s directive requires “ensuring, to the greatest extent practicable” that all UCs \nreceive  legal  “counsel  to  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings”  and  to  “protect  them  from \nmistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Direct redress of Plaintiffs’ \nharms is a practical consequence of enjoining “Defendants nationwide from ceasing to fund \ncounsel to represent unaccompanied children in violation of the TVPRA and the Foundational \nRule.”  Dkt. 1 at 39.  This is true regardless of how Defendants fashion the injunctive relief. \nB.  This Court has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Claims. \nThis Court rejected Defendants’ argument that the Tucker Act deprives the Court of \njurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ claims.  Dkt. 33 at 3 (citing Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 893530, at *4–\n7 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025)).  The Court is correct, and Plaintiffs address this issue only briefly. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n5 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 339\n \n\n(368 of 956), Page 368 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 368 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 16 of 36\n     \n \nThe law is clear: the Tucker Act only deprives the Court of jurisdiction of claims that are \nboth (1) founded upon contract-based rights and (2) seek a contract-based remedy.  See United \nAeronautical Corp. U.S. Air Force, 80 F.4th 1017, 1025-26 (9th Cir. 2023).  \nNeither of those conditions are met here.  The Tucker Act “yields when the obligation-\ncreating statute provides its own detailed remedies, or when the [APA] provides an avenue for \nrelief.”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. U.S., 590 U.S. 296, 323–24 (2020); see also Pacito v. Trump, \n2025 WL 655075, at *17 (W.D. Wash. Feb. 28, 2025) (rejecting argument Tucker Act bars APA \nreview).    Plaintiffs’  claims  stem  from  the  TVPRA,  the  Foundational  Rule,  and  the  APA: \nDefendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs violates their obligations under those \nauthorities and, in turn, violates the APA and is a breach of the Accardi doctrine, and arbitrary and \ncapricious.  See Dkt. 7 at 20-24.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ claims do not rely on or arise from any contract.   \nBecause Plaintiffs seek “declaratory and injunctive relief” under their statutory rights to \nprevent Defendants unlawfully refusing to provide any funding for counsel for UCs instead of \n“money in compensation for . . . losses,” the Tucker Act does not apply.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, \n487 U.S. 879, 893, 895; see also Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, \n1111 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (declaratory and injunctive relief are not “specific to actions that sound in \ncontract”); Pacito, 2025 WL 655075 at *17 (“[B]ecause Plaintiffs seek specific remedies, not \ndamages,” Tucker Act did not apply).  As “Claims Court[s do] not have the general equitable \npowers of a district court to grant prospective relief,” a district court is the proper venue for \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905–07.  That Defendants previously fulfilled their \nstatutory and regulatory obligations by contracting does not change this analysis—were that the \ncase, no plaintiff could challenge Defendants’ illegal actions.  See, e.g., Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n6 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 340\n \n\n(369 of 956), Page 369 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 369 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 17 of 36\n     \n \n(rejecting the “broad notion that any case requiring some reference to or incorporation of a \ncontract” cannot be heard in district courts) (cleaned up). \nC.  The Cancellation Order Determines Plaintiffs’ Legal Rights and Obligations and is \nFinal Agency Action Reviewable Under the APA. \nThe APA “sets forth the procedures by which federal agencies are accountable to the public \nand their actions subject to review by the courts.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 796 \n(1992).  Persons or organizations, like Plaintiffs here, who are “suffering legal wrong because of \nagency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant \nstatute, [are] entitled to judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  “[A]gency action” includes not \nonly agencies’ affirmative acts, but also their omissions and failures to act.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. § 551(13).  \nUnder the APA, this Court may set aside and enjoin unlawful agency action, and compel \nagency action unlawfully withheld, if it is a (1) “final agency action” “for which there is no other \nadequate remedy in a court,” so long as (2) there are no “statutes [that] preclude judicial review” \nand “agency action is [not] committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. §§ 701(a), 704.  \nPlaintiffs satisfy each of these criteria here, and APA relief is therefore proper.  \nFinal Agency Action.  An agency action is final for APA review where two conditions are \nsatisfied: (1) “the action must mark the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process,” \nand (2) “the action must be one by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (quotation \nmarks and citations omitted).  Defendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs is a final \nagency action.  See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 2025 WL 368852, at *11 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 3, 2025) (attempt to “pause” funding and disbursements is final agency action); Imm. Defs. \nLaw Ctr. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. 2:21-cv-00395, Dkt. 304, at *18–19 (C.D. Cal. Mar. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n7 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 341\n \n\n(370 of 956), Page 370 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 370 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 18 of 36\n     \n \n14, 2025) (in TVPRA context, final agency action found because policy was not tentative, \ndecision-making was not ongoing, and legal consequences would flow from action). \nHere, Defendants clearly ceased funding direct representation for UCs in violation of an \nexpress statutory mandate and their own regulatory frameworks.  The Cancellation Order directed \nPlaintiffs to stop all work providing direct representation to UCs, including pre-existing clients.  \nThis notification is final.  VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶ 13; NWIRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-10) ¶ 10; RMIAN \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 12; Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 11. \nSince the Cancellation Order and its ensuing consequences, the choices facing Plaintiffs \nhave grown even more dire.  Defendants’ actions and failure to comply with the Court’s Order  \ncontinue to force Plaintiffs to choose between providing unfunded direct representation with \nextremely limited resources; cutting other vital organizational programs, laying off, furloughing, \nor terminating staff; and/or seeking to withdraw from their ongoing representation duties for court \nhearings, client meetings, and other important preparations for legal proceedings.  See e.g., Dkt. 7 \nat 10-11; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 9; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶ 21.  The \nlonger Plaintiffs go without funding or clarity regarding how to handle their current clients, the \nfewer services they can provide as they are forced to withdraw from ongoing representations, cut \nother core programs, and/or lay off or reassign staff.

Thus, the termination has \nan immediate effect on parties’ rights or obligations.  \nNo Bar to Review: Defendants’ actions do not fall within the limited exceptions to judicial \nreview under the APA.  The longstanding presumption of judicial review for agency actions under \nthe APA “may be rebutted only if the relevant statute precludes review, 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(1), or if \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n8 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 342\n \n\n(371 of 956), Page 371 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 371 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 19 of 36\n     \n \nthe action is ‘committed to agency discretion by law,’ § 701(a)(2).”  Weyerhaeuser Co. v. U.S. \nFish & Wildlife Serv., 586 U.S. 9, 23 (2018).  Neither exception applies here. \nFirst, the “well-settled” presumption of judicial review for agency actions can be overcome \nonly by “clear and convincing evidence” of congressional intent to preclude judicial review.  See, \ne.g., Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 252-53 (2010).  No statute bars review of Plaintiffs’ claims \nhere.  Bowen v. Mich. Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 670–71 (1986). \nSecond, Defendants’ refusal to fund direct representation for UCs does not fall into the \n“very narrow” exception for actions committed to agency discretion.  Arizona Power Pooling \nAss’n. v. Morton, 527 F.2d 721, 727 (9th Cir. 1975).  This exception is “restrict[ed] to those rare \ncircumstances where the relevant statute is drawn so that a court would have no meaningful \nstandard against which to judge the agency’s exercise of discretion.”  Weyerhaeuser Co., 586 U.S. \nat 23 (emphasis added) (quoting Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 191 (1993)).  The Ninth Circuit \napplies this exception only when “there is truly no law to apply.”  Jajati v. U.S. Customs & Border \nProt., 102 F.4th 1011, 1014 (9th Cir. 2024) (quotation marks omitted). \nThe TVPRA, agency regulations, and Defendants’ own policies and announcements, \nprovide “meaningful standards under which courts can review whether [Defendants’] wielded its \ndiscretion in a permissible manner.”  Jajati, 102 F.4th at 1014.  As the Court noted in its Order, \nDefendants’ actions “potentially violate[] Congress’s express directive in the TVPRA and ORR’s \nown commitments in the Foundational Rule,” both “meaningful standards” under which the Court \ncan review Defendants’ actions.  Dkt. 33 at 5.  Both the TVPRA and ORR regulations include \nlanguage  describing  Defendants’  obligations  to  fund  direct  representations.    See  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1232(c)(5) (Defendants “shall ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that all UCs receive \nlegal  “counsel  to  represent  them  in  legal  proceedings”)  (emphasis  added);  45  C.F.R. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n9 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 343\n \n\n(372 of 956), Page 372 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 372 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 20 of 36\n     \n \n§ 410.1309(a)(4) (ORR “shall fund legal service providers . . . subject to ORR’s discretion and \navailable appropriations”).  This language offers a clear standard to judge Defendants’ actions.  \nSee e.g., Arizona Power Pooling Ass’n, 527 F.2d at 727 (holding that statutory language instructing \nthat the agency “shall” devise the “most feasible plan” for obtaining electronic power made it \n“clear that . . . the [agency did] not have unfettered discretion” and the exception for actions \ncommitted to agency discretion did not apply).   \nDefendants’ cancellation of all funding is not the type of “lump-sum appropriation” or \nother judgment that is presumptively committed to agency discretion.  Weyerhaeuser Co., 586 \nU.S. at 23.  In their Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion for TRO, Defendants rely heavily on Lincoln \nv. Vigil to argue that funding for direct representation for UCs is wholly committed to agency \ndiscretion.  See Dkt. 24 at 18; Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182 (1993).  There, the Court emphasized \nthe relevant “appropriations Acts . . . do not mention the [cancelled] Program,” the relevant statutes \n“speak about Indian health only in general terms,” and “Congress never expressly appropriated \nfunds” for the cancelled program.  Id. at 186, 193–94.  In contrast, here, the relevant statutes point \nto Defendants’ obligations to ensure direct representation to the “greatest extent practicable” and \nCongress has expressly appropriated funds for services required under the TVPRA, including \nprovision of counsel.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, \nPub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, \nPub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 664–665 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.   \nThat Defendants have some discretion in how to allocate funds for direct representation \ndoes not render their actions unreviewable under the APA.  Even “grants [of] broad discretion to \nan agency” do “not render the agency's decisions completely nonreviewable . . .  unless the \nstatutory scheme, taken together with other relevant materials, provides absolutely no guidance as \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n10 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 344\n \n\n(373 of 956), Page 373 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 373 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 21 of 36\n     \n \nto how that discretion is to be exercised.”  Robbins v. Reagan, 780 F.2d 37, 45 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(emphasis added).  Here, both the statutory and regulatory schemes clearly provide such guidance. \nD.  Termination of the Direct Representation Programs Violates the TVPRA.  \nUnder the TVPRA, Congress mandated the government “shall ensure, to the greatest extent \npracticable,” that all UCs receive legal “counsel to represent them in legal proceedings” and to \n“protect them from mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Canceling \nfunding for direct representation services to UCs when appropriations are available (as they are) \nviolates this express congressional mandate. \nThe TVPRA, which requires Defendants to “ensure [UC direct representation] to the \ngreatest extent practicable,” prohibits Defendants refusing to fund direct representation so long as \nDefendants have available appropriations (as they do).  See, e.g., Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18 \n(APA violated when agencies withheld appropriated funds because they were “required, ‘to the \nextent of available appropriations,’ to ensure provision of support services for resettled refugees”).  \nDefendants terminated funding and ordered Plaintiffs to cease work without providing any other \navenues of legal services for UCs—failing to “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable,” that UCs \nhave  access  to  legal  counsel.    The  Cancellation  Order  effectively  ends  meaningful  direct \nrepresentation for UCs.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶¶ 20–21. \nAlthough the TVPRA grants Defendants some discretion in how to allocate appropriated \nfunds for legal access, it does not grant discretion to choose not to allocate appropriated funds at \nall.  Defendants cannot simply cease funding for direct representation in its entirety, as they did \nhere.  See Pacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *18.  Further, Defendants failed to provide any guidance \nto Plaintiffs regarding their ongoing UC representations, or any alternative plan for carrying out \ntheir duties under the statute and applicable ethical rules.  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) Ex. 3. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n11 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 345\n \n\n(374 of 956), Page 374 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 374 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 22 of 36\n     \n \nE.  Terminating Direct Representation Programs Violates the ORR Foundational Rule. \nThe government is “bound by the regulations it imposes upon itself.”  See United States v. \n1996 Freightliner Fld. Tractor VIN 1FUYDXYB-TP822291, 634 F.3d 1113, 1116 (9th Cir. 2011).  \nUnder the Accardi doctrine, parties may bring claims under the APA asserting that an agency has \nfailed to follow its own rules and internal policies.  See, e.g., Alcaraz v. I.N.S., 384 F.3d 1150, \n1162 (9th Cir. 2004).  \nFor an Accardi claim, Plaintiffs must show (1) the government violated its own regulations; \nand (2) Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced by that violation.  See Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. \nMayorkas, 2024 WL 4370577, at *8–9 (S.D. Cal. Sept. 30, 2024); see also Carnation Co. v. Sec’y \nof Lab., 641 F.2d 801, 804 n.4 (9th Cir. 1981) (the Accardi standard is “whether violation of the \nregulation prejudiced the party involved”).  Defendants’ actions violate their express commitment \nin the binding Foundational Rule to fund direct representation as long as appropriations are \navailable.  Plaintiffs are substantially prejudiced because they are mission-bound to serve their UC \nclients in cases formerly funded by Defendants, and there are no other government-funded legal \nservice providers to whom Plaintiffs can transfer those cases.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8; Estrella \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 3, 16; KIND Decl. (Dkt. 7-18) ¶ 19; VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶ 2; see also MM \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 4-5; DHCC Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.  Plaintiffs are spending discretionary funds to maintain \nrepresentations for as long as possible because withdrawing is antithetical to their missions and, \nfor some, impermissible under local ethics rules, particularly where no other service providers can \ntake the cases.  Without an injunction, Plaintiffs will have to choose between bankruptcy and \nabandoning their missions .  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3; GHIRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7–8; RMIAN Decl. \n(Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 14; Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 15; see also infra Section II.A.  \nORR has “recognize[d] that most unaccompanied children need legal services to resolve \ntheir immigration status and that representation appears to have a significant impact on both the \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n12 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 346\n \n\n(375 of 956), Page 375 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 375 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 23 of 36\n     \n \ncourt appearance rate and the outcome of cases for unaccompanied children.”  89 Fed. Reg. 34384, \n34529 (Apr. 30, 2024); see also Al Otro Lado, 2024 WL 4370577, at *9 (preambles may \nsufficiently bind agencies under Accardi).  Just last year, ORR stated its intention to provide \n“universal legal representation for unaccompanied children by FY 2027.”  HHS: Administration \nfor Children & Families, Justification of Estimates for Appropriations Committees, at 78 (2024), \nhttps://shorturl.at/4VDSL; see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 34526 (“ORR strives for 100 percent legal \nrepresentation of unaccompanied children.”).  Thus, in 2024, ORR adopted the Foundational Rule, \nwhich states in relevant part: \nTo the extent ORR determines that appropriations are available, and insofar as it is \nnot practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel, ORR shall fund legal service \nproviders  to  provide  direct  immigration  legal  representation  for  certain \nunaccompanied children, subject to ORR’s discretion and available appropriations. \n45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4) (emphasis added).  Defendants’ actions on March 21, 2025, subvert \nthese ORR commitments and regulations, violate the Accardi doctrine, and are both contrary to \nlaw and arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  See Torres v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 411 \nF. Supp. 3d 1036, 1068–69 (C.D. Cal. 2019) (agency’s violation of its own procedures violates the \nAPA).  Congressional appropriations are readily available until September 2027 to fund direct \nrepresentation, including funds appropriated as recently as March 15, 2025, one week before \nDefendants’ challenged actions.  See, e.g., Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions \nAct, 2025, Pub. L. 119-4, Div. A Tit. I Sec. 1101(8) (2025); Further Consolidated Appropriations \nAct, 2024, Pub. L. 118-47, Div. D Tit. I, 138 Stat. 460, 665-666 (2024); S. Rep. 118-84, at 169.  \nWithout explanation and without a plan to replace these critical legal services for unaccompanied \nchildren, the Cancellation Order violates Defendants’ obligations and has caused and will continue \nto cause Plaintiffs substantial hardship, as described below.  See also infra Section II.A.  Because \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n13 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 347\n \n\n(376 of 956), Page 376 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 376 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 24 of 36\n     \n \nDefendants’  actions  violate  their  own  stated  policies  and  substantially  prejudice  Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.   \nF.  Terminating Funding for Direct Representation is Arbitrary and Capricious. \nDefendants’ decision to stop funding any direct representation for any UCs ignores the \nwell-documented  efficacy  of  direct  representation  for  UCs  and  is  arbitrary  and  capricious.  \nDefendants have refused to produce any administrative record to justify their decision until they \nfile their answer.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 14.  Plaintiffs and the Court are left to evaluate Defendants’ \njustification through statements in the Stop Work Order, Cancellation Order, and filings in this \naction.  The Stop Work Order provides no explanation, Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 1, and the Cancellation \nOrder says only that the decision was for Defendants’ “convenience,” id. at Ex. 3.  This leaves the \nCourt with only Defendants’ post-hoc justifications offered through litigation, but these are plainly \ninsufficient.  Dept. of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the U. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 23 (2020) (agencies \ncannot  support  their  actions  via  “belated  justifications”  or  “convenient  litigating  positions” \n(quotation marks and citations omitted).  To the extent such reasons are properly before the Court, \nDefendants’ proffered justifications of saving money and encouraging pro bono representation fail \nto address the requirements outlined above.  See Dkt. 24-1 ¶¶ 14–15; Dkt. 24 at 8. \nA court “shall” set aside agency action if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with the law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29 (1983); see also Humane Soc. of U.S. v. \nLocke, 626 F.3d 1040, 1048 (9th Cir. 2010).  Agency action should be set aside as arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency fails to explain the basis of its decision, fails to consider all relevant factors \nand articulate a “rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,” or fails to offer \na “reasoned analysis” for departure from preexisting policies.  Motor Vehicles Mfrs. Ass’n, 463 \nU.S. at 42–43.  In cases where the purported rationale for agency action is pretextual, it must be \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n14 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 348\n \n\n(377 of 956), Page 377 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 377 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 25 of 36\n     \n \nset aside.  See, e.g., Dep't of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 780-85 (2019); Transportation Div. \nof the Int'l Ass’n of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail, & Transp. Workers v. Fed. R.R. Admin., 988 F.3d 1170, \n1182-85 (9th Cir. 2021).  Here, Defendants fail on all grounds, justifying preliminary injunctive \nrelief (as well as ultimate relief on the merits).  \n1.  Defendants Failed to Adequately Explain the Basis for the Decision. \nA “fundamental requirement of administrative law is that an agency set forth its reasons \nfor decision; an agency’s failure to do so constitutes arbitrary and capricious agency action.”  \nTourus Recs., Inc. v. Drug Enforcement Admin., 259 F.3d 731, 737 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (quotation \nmarks omitted);  see also SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947).  Unsupported \nconclusions are insufficient, see City and Cnty of San Francisco v. U.S. Citizen and Immigration \nServs., 981 F.3d 742, 761 (9th Cir. 2020) (rejecting agency’s “conclusory mantra” and lack of \n“detailed  justification”),  as  are  post  hoc  rationalizations  in  briefing,  unsupported  by  an \nadministrative record, see Humane Soc’y of U.S., 626 F.3d at 1049-50. \nDefendants’ decision to cut all funding for direct representation they have funded for more \nthan a decade—with appropriations available until at least September 30, 2027—came with no \nexplanation, let alone one that can stand up to judicial scrutiny.  Defendants have refused to \nproduce any administrative record at this stage that could justify their actions.  See, Amica Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 14.  Even if Defendants’ post-hoc justifications offered in this case could be considered, \nDefendants fail to address the fact that Congress has already appropriated these funds through \nSeptember 2027, and offer no explanation of how a “shift” to pro bono services could fulfill their \nTVPRA and Foundational Rule obligations to provide counsel “to the greatest extent possible.”  \nDefendants also offer no evidence they are doing anything to facilitate a “shift,” and even if they \nwere, they created a significant shortfall in representation in the interim.  \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n15 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 349\n \n\n(378 of 956), Page 378 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 378 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 26 of 36\n     \n \nHistory and congressional statements show pro bono counsel alone cannot provide counsel \n“to the greatest extent possible,” under the TVPRA.  See Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 51–63 (citing original sources).  \nORR already tried relying solely on pro bono counsel.  The idea that funding representation \nactually “disincentivizes the recruitment of and the volunteering of pro bono counsel” (Dkt. 24-1 \n¶ 24) gets the history backward—funded representation stepped in to fill huge representation gaps \nleft by relying only on pro bono capacity.  See also Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 5 (of the 64,008 \nindividuals Estrella served in 2024, they have only secured pro bono assistance for one).  ORR’s \n2008 pro bono pilot program produced a report acknowledging pro bono counsel alone were \ninsufficient to represent UCs.  See Olga Byrne & Elise Miller, The Flow of Unaccompanied \nChildren Through the Immigration System, at 22–23 (Mar. 2012), https://shorturl.at/KI3Jt.  That \nis why ORR started funding direct representation.  See Dkt. 1 ¶¶ 57–59. \nFunding legal services providers like Plaintiffs increases pro bono representation of UCs, \nbecause Plaintiffs oversee and mentor large networks of pro bono attorneys—non-experts in \nimmigration who could not represent UCs without the aid of immigration professionals.  See, e.g., \nDkt. 7-4 ¶¶ 11, 44; Dkt. 7-7 ¶ 2; NWIRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 7.  When Plaintiff “ImmDef has worked \nwith pro bono attorneys to provide legal representation for children, [they] have found that even \nlicensed attorneys who are not specialized in this area of law need intensive training [from \nImmDef] and support to be able to effectively represent their clients.”  Dkt. 7-8 ¶ 11.  “[P]ro bono \nattorneys do not generally have immigration expertise,” most do not speak the languages UCs \nspeak, many “are unwilling to commit to the timeframe of children’s immigration cases or with \nthe special care needed when working with children,” and pro bono attorneys need experts to “train \nand support [them].”  Dkt. 7-6 ¶ 12; see also RMIAN Supp. Decl. ¶ 9 (“The vast majority of \nRMIAN’s volunteer attorneys do not have immigration law experience and would never consider \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n16 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 350\n \n\n(379 of 956), Page 379 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 379 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 27 of 36\n     \n \ntaking an immigration case without RMIAN’s [support.]”); Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 11; VAAP Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 8; DHCC Supp. Decl. ¶ 7; Public Counsel Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; NIJC Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 6–8; KIND \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 7.  The Cancellation Order cut funding for this essential mentorship and training.  \nAmica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8.  And Plaintiffs cannot sustain their representations (or take new ones) \nwithout funding.  See, infra, at 20–22; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 7–12.  Defendants’ post hoc “shift” \njustification is contradicted by facts and history—and by what funding Defendants chose to cut. \nDefendant’s attempt to justify this as a cost-saving measure is likewise unavailing.  Dkt. \n24-1  ¶ 18.    The  TVPRA  and  the  Foundational  Rule  require  Defendants  to  fund  direct \nrepresentation to the “greatest extent practicable” with appropriated funds.  See, supra, at 11, 13.  \nAnd  Congress  has  ordered  Defendants  to  spend  appropriated  funding  to  provide  funded \nrepresentation for UCs.  For example, in 2022, the House Appropriations Committee, in support \nof “the continued expansion of independent legal services for unaccompanied children,” directed \nthat funded representations should “be made available to children up to funded capacity.” H. Rep. \n117-403, at 200 (emphasis added).  An administration’s “policy” of cutting spending is simply not \na legally cognizable reason to refuse to spend appropriated funds: the Executive cannot withhold \nor delay disbursement of appropriated funds, even if it “has policy reasons . . . for wanting to spend \nless than the full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program.”  See In re \nAiken Cnty, 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (plurality). \nBecause even these post hoc reasons offered in litigation fall apart under the slightest \nscrutiny, the decision is arbitrary and capricious.  See Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 136 S. \nCt. 2117, 2125 (2016) (“Where the agency has failed to provide even a minimal level of analysis” \nfor its decision, “its action is arbitrary and capricious.”). \n2.  Defendants Failed to Consider All Relevant Factors and Articulate a Rational \nConnection Between the Facts Found and the Choice Made. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n17 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 351\n \n\n(380 of 956), Page 380 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 380 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 28 of 36\n     \n \nTo survive arbitrary and capricious review, an agency must have “demonstrated a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Wawszkiewicz v. Dep’t of Treasury, \n670 F.2d 296, 301 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (quotation marks and citations omitted).  Courts “do not defer \nto the agency’s conclusory or unsupported suppositions.”  Standing Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Engs., 255 F. Supp. 3d 101, 121–22 (D.D.C. 2017) (quotation marks and citations \nomitted).  Even crediting Defendants’ ‘shift to pro bono’ rationale, Defendants have not offered \nany analysis or findings that could show that such a “shift” is justified and could provide counsel \n“to the greatest extent practicable.”  And significant evidence demonstrates that ending funding \nfor direct representation will decrease the number of pro bono representations as well.  See, supra, \nat 16–17.  Where, as here, “no findings and no analysis . . . justify the choice made,” the APA \n“will not permit” a court to accept the agency’s decision.  Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United \nStates, 371 U.S. 156, 167 (1962).  Because Defendants “should have considered those matters but \ndid not,” their “failure was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA.”  Dep’t of Homeland \nSec. v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 33 (2020). \n3.  Defendants Failed to Offer a Reasoned Explanation for Their Policy Reversal. \nWhen the government reverses its own established policy, it has an even greater burden to \njustify its actions.  The agency must “acknowledge and provide an adequate explanation for its \ndeparture from established precedent, and an agency that neglects to do so acts arbitrarily and \ncapriciously.”  Jicarilla Apache Nation v. U.S. Dep’t of the Interior, 613 F.3d 1112, 1119 (D.C. \nCir. 2010) (quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Encino Motorcars, 579 U.S. at 221–\n22 (an agency cannot depart from prior policy without “explaining its changed position”).   \nDefendants’ refusal to fund any direct representation for UCs is a reversal of more than a \ndecade  of  funding  direct  representation,  continued  year  after  year  by  congressional  reports \ndirecting Defendants to fund direct representation and to expand such funding.  By cancelling \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n18 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 352\n \n\n(381 of 956), Page 381 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 381 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 29 of 36\n     \n \nfunding with no explanation—or at most an insufficient and pretextual explanation—Defendants \nhave acted arbitrarily and capriciously.  See Jicarilla Apache Nation, 613 F.3d at 1119. \n4.  To the Extent Defendants Offer Any Reasons, Those Reasons Are Pretextual. \nDefendants’  two purported reasons for cutting off required  funding are pretextual—\nDefendants want to substitute the Executive’s policy goals for Congress’s own considered policies \nthat it expressed in the TVPRA and following appropriations bills and reports.  See, supra, at 13, \n17.  Defendants have twice tried to stop funding legal representation for UCs.  The February 18, \n2025, Stop Work Order gave no reason and, to the contrary, stressed to Acacia that the order had \nnothing to do with “poor performance” of the funded services.  See Dkt. 7-15, Ex. 1.  The March \n21,  2025,  Cancellation  Order  also  gave  no  reason—it  simply  cited  “the  Government’s \nconvenience.”  See id. at Ex. 3.  Recent court filings reveal the Cancellation Order was issued \nshortly after a Department of Government Efficiency (“DOGE”) staffer was detailed to the HHS \ndepartment overseeing ORR “to identify waste, fraud, and abuse” under the DOGE Executive \nOrder and given access to the extremely sensitive database of information about unaccompanied \nchildren.  See Am. Fed. Of Labor and Congress of Indus. Orgs. v. Dept. of Labor, No. 1:25-cv-\n00339-JDB, Dkt. 73-2 at 11-12 (D.D.C.).  Defendants now admit the decision was made because \nof “this Administration’s policy goals,” Dkt. 24-1 ¶ 18, and offer two pretextual justifications for \nthose goals.  But “[a]bsent congressional authorization, the Administration may not redistribute or \nwithhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals.”  City & Cnty. of \nSan Francisco v. Trump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018).  That is what happened here, and \nDefendants have declined to produce a record that could show otherwise.   \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n19 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 353\n \n\n(382 of 956), Page 382 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 382 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 30 of 36\n     \n \nII.  Plaintiffs Satisfy the Remaining Requirements for a Preliminary Injunction \nA.  Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Harm \nA preliminary injunction is appropriate where, as here, the moving party shows that it faces \nirreparable harm—harm which is (1) “immediate”, Caribbean Marine Servs. Co. v. Baldrige, 844 \nF.2d 668, 674 (9th Cir. 1988), and (2) “for which there is no adequate legal remedy.”  Ariz. Dream \nAct Coal. v. Brewer, 757 F.3d 1053, 1068 (9th Cir. 2014).   \nThe Court correctly found Plaintiffs “are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief.”  Dkt. 33 at 5.  Defendants have not complied with the Court’s Order, making \nthe requested injunctive relief all the more critical.  Defendants’ termination of funding for direct \nrepresentation directly interferes with Plaintiffs’ missions, immediately impeding their ability to \nprovide legal representation that is at the heart of Plaintiffs’ missions.  FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 5–\n8; GHIRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3, 7–8; ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶ 7–12; VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7; Estrella \nSupp. Decl. ¶ 4; RMIAN Decl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 22; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶¶ 21–22; NWIRP (Dkt. \n7-10)  ¶¶  13–15;  NIJC  Supp.  Decl.  ¶  9.    There  is  no  question  ceasing  funding  for  direct \nrepresentation for UCs and terminating existing services causes imminent and irreparable harm to \nPlaintiffs and their missions.  FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 37; NIJC Supp. \nDecl. ¶ 9.  The Cancellation Order prevents Plaintiffs from providing thousands of UCs the direct \nrepresentation required by the TVPRA and the Foundational Rule, frustrating Plaintiffs’ primary \nmissions of ensuring UCs are supported by legal counsel, including by representing these children \nas contemplated by Congress and the TVPRA.  See, e.g., FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶ 5; ImmDef Decl. ¶ \n2.  If this occurs, “‘there can be no do over and no redress.’”  League of Women Voters of U.S. v. \nNewby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting League of Women Voters of N.C. v. North \nCarolina, 769 F.3d 224, 247 (4th Cir. 2014)).   \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n20 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 354\n \n\n(383 of 956), Page 383 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 383 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 31 of 36\n     \n \nPlaintiffs relied on Congress’s and Defendants’ assurances that funding would remain \navailable.  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 11; RMIAN Decl. (Dkt. 7-11) ¶ 18.  Cutting off funding \nthreatens immediate and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs’ missions and existence.  See, e.g., CLSEPA \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-16) ¶ 13; VAAP Decl. (Dkt. 7-7) ¶¶ 22–24; KIND Decl. (Dkt. 7-18) ¶¶ 16–19.  For \nexample,  on  April  1,  2025,  ImmDef  had  to  lay  off  twenty-four  staff  funded  under  the \nUnaccompanied Children’s Program in response to the Cancellation Order; these staff losses \nthreaten its ability to continue representing its 1,900 UC clients.  ImmDef Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 3–4; \nImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶¶ 20–22.  Since their initial declaration in this matter, VAAP has had to \nterminate 25% of their staff.  VAAP Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  Amica Center has been unable to fill \nvacancies and expects it will only be able to fund representation of UC clients another 2 months, \nat most, before it materially limits other mission-driven work.  Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  Estrella \ndel Paso has 324 cases and predicts the loss of funding will require layoffs and increase caseloads \nfor its staff.  Estrella Decl. (Dkt. 7-14) ¶ 6. The Galveston-Houston Immigration Representation \nProject expects to lay off most of their Immigrant Children and Youth staff within four weeks.  \nGHIRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-17) ¶ 23.  Sustaining these services, in accordance with its mission but \nwithout this funding, will cost the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project $200,000 a month.  NWIRP \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-10) ¶ 13.  Private providers and other organizations predict devastating financial \nconsequences, including the potential for bankruptcy.  DHCC Decl. (Dkt. 7-5) ¶ 20; MM Decl. \n(Dkt. 7-19) ¶ 18; see also KIND Supp. Decl. ¶ 4 (“[O]n March 27, 2025, KIND laid off over 240 \nstaff members in legal services psychosocial services, and other program support roles”).  These \nlosses do not account for the organizational knowledge at risk of being lost.  Estrella Decl. (Dkt. \n7-14) ¶ 6; FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 38; Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 25; ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) \n¶ 21. \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n21 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 355\n \n\n(384 of 956), Page 384 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 384 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 32 of 36\n     \n \nThe harm to Plaintiffs and their clients is imminent, irreparable, and ongoing, particularly \ngiven Defendants’ failure to comply with this Court’s Order.  The March 21, 2025, Cancellation \nOrder terminated funding immediately, but provided no guidance as to how Plaintiffs could meet \ntheir existing obligations, including immigration court hearings scheduled for that week.  DHCC \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-5) ¶ 15; Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 20; ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 24.  Plaintiffs have \nethical obligations to their clients and cannot immediately withdraw from representations; most \nattorneys require court permission to withdraw.  FIRRP Decl. (Dkt. 7-4) ¶ 39.  Plaintiffs and their \nclients are already experiencing irreparable harm far exceeding the mere loss of funding, including \nbecause they have had to furlough or layoff staff and increase the caseloads of staff who can stay \non.  See e.g. ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶¶ 20–22; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 3–4; NWIRP Supp. Decl. ¶ \n5; Estrella Supp. Decl. ¶ 3.  After reserves run out, ImmDef will be forced “to take drastic action \nto terminate staff across all positions funded under this contract.” ImmDef Decl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 21.  \nChildren’s immigration cases “are complex, often take years to complete, and require highly \nskilled attorneys to competently handle them.”   Id. at ¶ 23.  Impacted staff have  years of \nindividualized experience with clients, making replacing them impracticable.   \nHarms to children will be swift and severe, further frustrating Plaintiffs’ missions to ensure \nas many noncitizens as possible receive legal support.  For example, “if a child at one of the ORR-\nsubcontracted facilities we serve is identified as having an urgent legal need such as an outstanding \nremoval order, Amica Center—the only legal provider with access to the ORR-subcontracted \nfacility—would not be funded to provide the necessary legal service to protect the child from \nimminent removal.”  Amica Decl. (Dkt. 7-15) ¶ 21; Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 8 (to their knowledge \n“no children  in the ORR-subcontracted facilities with which  [they] work have successfully \nobtained pro bono representation since March 21.”).  This is even more troubling in light of policies \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n22 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 356\n \n\n(385 of 956), Page 385 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 385 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 33 of 36\n     \n \nincreasing the need for legal services, including notices on March 21, 2025 (the day of the \nCancellation Order) that “DHS would begin serving Notices to Appear (NTAs) ‘imminently’ on \nchildren in ORR custody and that those Master Calendar Hearings were expected to take place ‘in \nthe coming days and weeks.’” Amica Supp. Decl. ¶ 76; FIRRP Supp. Decl. ¶¶ 5–8; NIJC Supp. \nDecl. ¶¶ 4, 9.  Without funding or guidance, Plaintiffs will not be able to fulfill their missions and \nrepresent UCs in these proceedings.  See RMIAN Supp. Decl. ¶ 6–7.  As Plaintiff ImmDef \nexplains, “[a]t this very moment, there are children in ORR custody who need our representation \nwho are not receiving it.  This means that children who want voluntary departure will have their \nreturn home unacceptably delayed, victims of trafficking will not be able to access the protections \nthey deserve, and children fleeing persecution will not be able to have their day in court.”  ImmDef \nDecl. (Dkt. 7-8) ¶ 25.  Absent a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm. \nB.  The Balance of Equities  \nFinally, in considering whether to grant a preliminary injunction, the Court should “balance \nthe competing claims of injury and . . . consider the effect on each party of the granting or \nwithholding of the requested relief.”  Disney Enters., Inc. v. VidAngel, Inc., 869 F.3d 848, 866 (9th \nCir. 2017) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at ).  Where an injunction will not “substantially injure the \nother [interested] parties,” the balance of equities tips in plaintiffs’ favor.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434.  \nHere, the balance of the equities “tip[] sharply in the [Plaintiffs’] favor,” supporting a preliminary \ninjunction.  Cottrell, 632 F.3d at 1135. \nDefendants will not be harmed by a preliminary injunction: as the Court found, “[t]he \nGovernment fails to convince that it would suffer harm” from injunctive relief.  Dkt. 33 at 6.  The \nGovernment “cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.”  \nRodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013); cf. Zepeda v. I.N.S., 753 F.2d 719, 727 \n(9th Cir. 1983).  Instead, “there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n23 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 357\n \n\n(386 of 956), Page 386 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 386 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 34 of 36\n     \n \nabide by the federal laws that govern their existence and operations.”  State v. Azar, 385 F. Supp. \n3d 960, 985 (N.D. Cal. 2019), vacated on other grounds and remanded sub nom. California ex rel. \nBecerra v. Azar, 950 F.3d 1067 (9th Cir. 2020) (quoting Newby, 838 F.3d at 12) (cleaned up). \nTerminating funding for direct representation for UCs, without any plan to ensure current \nrepresentations are not interrupted, violates Congress’s directive in the TVPRA and ORR’s own \ncommitments in the Foundational Rule.  And as the Court found, “the maintenance of funding for \ndirect legal representation services furthers the critical public interests of ensuring children have \naccess to legal representation and protection from human trafficking.”  Dkt. 33 at 6.  Maintaining \n“funding of legal representation for unaccompanied children promotes efficiency and fairness \nwithin the immigration system.”  Id.; see also Dkt. 28 (former immigration judges explaining the \nimportance  of  continued  funding);  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  34528-29  (recognizing  benefit  of  UC \nrepresentation to the immigration system generally); see also Dkt. 7 at 29.  \nBecause Defendants do not face any injury from the issuance of an injunction to stop their \nillegal  action  and  Plaintiffs  and  the  public  have  a  substantial  interest  in  maintaining  legal \nrepresentation, the balance of equities weighs heavily in favor of issuing a preliminary injunction.  \nDefendants’ failure to comply with this Court’s Order only further weighs in favor of a preliminary \ninjunction here. \nIII.  A Nationwide Injunction is Appropriate \nWhile injunctive relief must be tailored to the scope of the case, “there is no bar against . . . \nnationwide  relief  in  federal  district  or  circuit  court  when  it  is  appropriate,”  such  as  when \nnationwide “breadth is necessary to give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.”  \nBresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 1170–71(9th Cir. 1987).  A number of factors counsel in favor \nof a nationwide injunction here.  First, APA injunctions are often nationwide, because when \nDefendants violated the APA, they did so without geographic limitation.  See E. Bay Sanctuary \nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n24 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 358\n \n\n(387 of 956), Page 387 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 387 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 35 of 36\n     \n \nCovenant, 993 F.3d at 680-81 (cleaned up).  Second, nationwide injunctions are also common in \ncases  like  this  that  involve  immigration  policy  set  by  Congress,  because  “a  fragmented \nimmigration policy would run afoul of the constitutional and statutory requirement for uniform \nimmigration law and policy.”  Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d 1151, 1166–67 (9th Cir. 2017).  \nThird, plaintiffs are located throughout the country, and “[d]ifferent interpretations of executive \npolicy across circuit or state lines will needlessly complicate agency and individual action,” see E. \nBay Sanctuary Covenant, 993 F.3d at 681, and piecemeal injunctive relief for the more than 80 \nproviders nationwide would be impractical to administer.  See HIAS, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309, \n326–27 (4th Cir. 2021).  The only complete and manageable relief is a nationwide injunction.  See \nCalifano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.S. 682, 702 (1979).   \nIV.  The Court Should Not Require an Injunction Bond \nCourts have broad discretion in determining whether a bond should be required under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c).  Walczak v. EPL Prolong, Inc., 198 F.3d 725, 733 (9th Cir. \n1999).  And a district court may “dispense with the security requirement” entirely, or “request \nmere nominal security,” if “requiring security would effectively deny access to judicial review.”  \nCal. ex rel. Van De Kamp v. Tahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 766 F.2d 1319, 1325 (9th Cir.1985); \nsee also Nat’l Council of Nonprofits, 2025 WL 597959 at *19.  The Court found no injunction \nbond was necessary under Rule 65(c) to issue a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 33 at 7, and it \nshould reach the same conclusion for a preliminary injunction—where the analysis is the same.   \nCONCLUSION \nDefendants’ actions violate the APA.  Because this conduct causes Plaintiffs immediate \nand irreparable harm, this Court should grant provisional nationwide relief enjoining Defendants’ \nillegal actions and preserving the status quo pending a final judgment.  The Court should tailor its \nrelief in light of Defendants’ failure to comply with the temporary restraining order.\nPlaintiffs’ Notice of Motion and Motion for a Preliminary Injunction \n25 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 359\n \n\n(388 of 956), Page 388 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 388 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37     Filed 04/04/25     Page 36 of 36\n     \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nApril 4, 2025 \n/s/  Alvaro M.

We are also the sole legal service provider \nfor two ORR long-term foster care facilities (“LTFC”): Building Bridges Foster Family \nAgency in Ontario, CA, and MarSell Wellness in Montebello, CA.  \n3.  My office currently represents around 60 children under the ORR contract. As of this date, \nI have not withdrawn representation for any case, but I am preparing to do so, for the \nreasons stated below.   \n4.  My office faces the prospect of having to furlough and shut down operations by July 2025 \nif funding for the representation is not restored. On April 1, 2025, I retained Ethics Counsel, \nat my law firms’ expense, to be able to ethically withdraw from cases before that date. I \nam currently preparing, with advice from my Ethics Counsel, an internal policy for \nwithdrawing from cases, identifying which cases to withdraw from, and the timeline and \nprocedures that would apply to those withdrawals.  \n5.  As of this date, I have been unable to withdraw from any cases due to the number of court \nhearings and filing deadlines I have had to comply with in the weeks since the contract \ntermination. In total, for the month of April 2025, my office has seven court hearings (in \nImmigration Court and State Court), one asylum interview, and one USCIS deadline to \nrespond to for clients retained under the ORR contract. We had three additional asylum \ninterviews for this month that we moved to reschedule for a later date, including one for a \none-year-old LTFC client. Just today, April 2, 2025, we appeared for two cases in the \ndetained juvenile docket in immigration court for clients in Long Term Foster Care. \nTomorrow, April 3, 2025, we have an asylum interview in the Asylum Office for another \nclient retained under the ORR contract.  \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 364\n\n(393 of 956), Page 393 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 393 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-2     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 3\n \n6.  Due to the imminency of those hearings and legal deadlines, we could not ethically \nwithdraw from the cases without prejudicing our clients, so we have continued to represent \nthem at our own expense. To give a minor example, our time and travel to the Asylum \noffice, around 80 miles round trip from our office location, is no longer going to be \nreimbursed by the contract. The expenditure of human resources, time, and materials \nrequired to represent existing clients under the ORR contract does not allow a small office \nlike mine to pivot finding additional sources of income.  \n \n7.  I was advised by my Ethics Counsel to not seek non-immigration pro bono counsel to place \ncases, as I did not have the capacity to train them and supervise them, which could lead to \ninadequate representation and ethical violations.  \n \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \nExecuted on the 2 of April 2025, in Pasadena, California.  \n              \n_______________________________  \nDaniela Hernandez Chong Cuy \nDirecting Attorney/Owner  \nLaw Office of Daniela Hernández Chong Cuy \nUCP Legal Service Provider \n \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 365\n\n(394 of 956), Page 394 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 394 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-3     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 3\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nMARTHA RUCH (CLSEPA) IN \n \nSUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION \nPlaintiffs, \nFOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \nv.   \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 366\n\n(395 of 956), Page 395 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 395 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-3     Filed 04/04/25     Page 2 of 3\n \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF MARTHA RUCH \nLEAD IMMIGRATION MANAGING ATTOREY FOR CLSEPA \n  \nI, Martha Ruch, make the following statements on behalf of myself and Community Legal Services \nin East Palo Alto (CLSEPA).

I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-16) as if fully set forth herein. \n2.  My name is Martha Ruch, and I am the Lead Managing Attorney of the Immigration \nProgram at Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto (“CLSEPA”). I have been an \nimmigration attorney with CLSEPA for five and a half years, since September 2019. \nCLSEPA is a non-profit legal aid organization that serves residents of San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California. CLSEPA has offices in the city of East Palo Alto, San \nFrancisco, and Mountain View. CLSEPA is one of the primary organizations dedicated to \nproviding free immigration legal services to low-income immigrants in San Mateo County \nand Santa Clara County, California, including indigent unaccompanied immigrant children \nwho are residing with sponsors in the San Francisco Bay Area after their release from \nOffice of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody.  \n3.  CLSEPA represents 23 children in their immigration matters whose cases were funded by \nU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). One client’s case is still in \nadministratively  closed  deportation  proceedings  in  immigration  court.  Since  the \ntermination of funding on March 21, 2025, CLSEPA attorneys have received one pending \nreferral from Catholic Charities Santa Clara County for a new potential client. Due to the \nloss  of  funding  from  HHS  that  supports  our  legal  representation  of  unaccompanied \nimmigrant children, CLSEPA has been unable to accept new referrals. \n4.  The financial impact of the loss of this funding is difficult for our organization. HHS \nprovided long-term funding that potentially could cover the full cost of the case. HHS \nprovided sustainable funding that would allow for long-term representation that is required \nfor these children, whose cases may remain in process for months or years into the future \nbased on current processing times and policy. Without this funding, we must reconsider \nwhether we have enough funding to cover the costs of representation in the future.  \n5.  CLSEPA provides legal services in the areas of housing, workers’ rights, and reentry, in \naddition to immigration. We assist all residents of San Mateo and Santa Clara Counties, no \nmatter their race, ethnicity, age, national origin, veteran status, or language. HHS funding \nis one piece of our budget puzzle, but it is a critical piece that supports our work with our \nmost vulnerable clients – children who are in foster care or ORR facilities and who face \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 367\n\n(396 of 956), Page 396 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 396 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-3     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 3\ndeportation. This work is time-consuming and requires high levels of competency with \nimmigration law and with working with children. Our budget is always tight, and without \nthis  funding,  we  cannot  backfill  open  positions  on  our  immigration  team.  Each  of \nCLSEPA’s attorneys are now responsible for more clients since HHS abruptly cut the \nfunding for our direct legal representation work and left us unable to rehire. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 3rd of April 2025, in San Francisco, California \n \n ______________________________  \nMartha Ruch \nLead Managing Attorney, Immigration Program \nCLSEPA \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 368\n\n(397 of 956), Page 397 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 397 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-4     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST  SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nMELISSA MARI LOPEZ (ESTRELLA)\nPlaintiffs, \nMOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY \nv.

I  certify  under penalty of perjury that  the  following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-4) as if fully set forth herein. \n2.  My name is Roxana Avila-Cimpeanu. I am a licensed attorney and a member in good \nstanding in the State Bar of Arizona. I am currently employed as Deputy Director of the \nFlorence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project (“Florence Project” or “FIRRP”). I joined \nthe Florence Project on September 6, 2016, and have served in my current role since \nSeptember 2024. Before I assumed my current position, I previously served as Children’s \nLegal Program Manager, Managing Attorney for the Children’s Pro Bono Program, Pro \nBono Mentor, Staff Attorney, and Law Graduate with the Florence Project's Children’s \nLegal Program serving unaccompanied immigrant children in Arizona. During my time at \nthe Florence Project, I have personally provided free legal services, including friend of \ncourt  services,  direct  representation,  legal  orientation  and  education,  and  pro  bono \nmentorship, to at least 140 children. Additionally, as Children’s Legal Program Manager \nand Deputy Director I have supervised attorneys, pro bono volunteer attorneys, law \ngraduates, accredited representatives, legal assistants, intake specialists, and social workers \nwho have provided free legal services, both direct representation and pro se services, to \nthousands of individuals detained in Office of Refugee Resettlement “ORR” and ICE \ncustody in Arizona.  \n3.  Since filing the Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) on March 27, 2025, the \nFlorence Project has continued to provide services to our clients, drawing on funding from \nother sources and fundraising to ensure that we are able to provide legal representation, pro \nbono placement and mentoring, additional legal services, court preparation, and friend of \ncourt services to unrepresented children in keeping with our mission for as long as we can \nresponsibly financially manage to do so. Since the termination order on March 21, 2025, \nFlorence Project staff have provided over 500 hours of programmatic services that would \nhave fallen under terminated portions of the UCP, including meeting with clients, preparing \nnecessary  applications  and  filings,  preparing  individuals  for  upcoming  hearings  and \ninterviews,  attending  Immigration  Court  hearings,  attending  juvenile  court  hearings \nnecessary for children who have been abandoned, abused, or neglected to seek immigration \nrelief, and collecting and tracking necessary data and documentation for case management.    \n \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 373\n\n(402 of 956), Page 402 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 402 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-5     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 5\n4.  FIRRP attorneys have several important and imminent hearings for clients, for which \nwithdrawal of representation would cause great harm to the children’s cases and lives. \nFIRRP staff have at least eleven EOIR hearings and fourteen state court hearings scheduled \nfor clients in the coming weeks. The hearings are essential to avoid removal while the \nchildren seek relief, including state court predicate orders for abused, abandoned, or \nneglected children. \n5.  The significant harms to our clients and our organizational mission that will take place if \nwe are unable to continue our representation and other legal services are being exacerbated \nby current government policies that are accelerating the speed and need for immediate legal \nservices. For example, in the Tucson Immigration Court, we have seen a return to so-called \n“rocket dockets,” in which the government is rapidly scheduling a child to appear in court, \nmoving them quickly into removal proceedings, even knowing that many such children are \nlikely to reunify with sponsors outside of Arizona and should have their cases scheduled \nin those other locations. Indeed, in the Tucson Immigration Court children’s names are \nbeing added to the docket before their Notice to Appear, the official charging document, is \neven formally filed, raising serious due process concerns. Rocket dockets historically have \nbeen used to pressure children to accept removal orders quickly before they have an \nopportunity to feel settled and supported and often undermine due process for children. \nRocket dockets not only increase the speed at which Florence Project attorneys have to \nprepare cases of clients we are representing, but also create an increased need for Friend of \nCourt services that have been cut under the UCP termination. Since the Florence Project \nbegan serving children in 2000, a central tenet of our mission has been that no child should \nhave to stand alone in court. As Friend of Court, Florence Project staff meet that mission \neven when we cannot represent a child, by being present to stand with the child and help \nthe Court understand key facts that are relevant to assess the appropriate next steps in the \ncase, such as reunification status, best language, and potential forms of relief. As of the \ndate of signing, Florence Project is aware of at least eleven cases moving forward next \nweek on the rapid docket in Tucson, including four clients we already represent and seven \nchildren who do not have counsel, but to whom we would provide Friend of Court services. \nIn two of these cases, the children who are on the court’s docket do not appear to have a \nproperly filed and served Notice to Appear.  \n6.  The UCP contract termination also has aligned with increased need for legal services on a \nshort timeframe in the context of children’s asylum cases. Specifically, on or about March \n27, 2025, Florence Project staff began to receive notices from USCIS of asylum office \ninterviews being scheduled in cases with pending asylum applications. As of April 2, 2025, \nFlorence Project staff have received asylum interview notices for at least seven clients, \nmany with less than two-weeks' notice to prepare. Florence Project attorneys did not get \nany prior notice that an asylum office circuit ride – the term used when asylum officers \ncome to Arizona to do many asylum interviews at one time – was planned prior to receiving \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 374\n\n(403 of 956), Page 403 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 403 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-5     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 5\nnotice of the scheduled interviews. Due to this asylum office circuit ride, Florence Project \nattorneys have had to quickly reach out to clients to schedule client meetings, conduct final \npreparation  and  supplemental  briefing  for  interviews,  and  otherwise  coordinate  the \nlogistics for an asylum interview including identifying and contracting with interpreters – \nin asylum interviews, the petitioner must provide a competent interpreter, which is also a \ncost that typically is paid for through now terminated provisions of the UCP. Asylum \ninterviews are very traumatic for children and careful preparation and attention must be \npaid to avoid re-traumatization and to prepare children to talk about the worst days of their \nlives with a complete stranger. Additionally, attorneys must prepare updated, supplemental \nbriefings in order to support their client’s claim, which often requires translation of \ndocuments and evidence from the client’s country of origin. With the loss of UCP-funded \ninterpreter services, it has been extremely challenging to prepare the children, prepare the \nsupplemental  briefing,  and  schedule  an  interpreter  for  the  hearing.  This  is  further \ncomplicated by the fact that many FIRRP child clients speak rare Mayan indigenous \nlanguages, or unique dialects of less common languages for which interpreters are not \nreadily available. Although a TRO has been entered in this case, the Florence Project has \nyet to receive any guidance about whether interpretation services are again available under \nthe UCP and is currently paying for these services through other funding.  \n7.  Six Florence Project clients also will be turning 18 in the month of April, and do not have \nany current sponsorship options. In such cases, Florence Project attorneys and social \nworkers routinely work to identify safe, viable placements for these children to help ensure \nthat children are placed in the least restrictive setting, as required under law1, rather than \nsending these vulnerable youth to adult detention. Many such clients may be eligible for \nthe Unaccompanied Refugee Minor program (“URM”), however children need support \nboth in applying for the program and finding interim housing options since the URM \nprogram has been at capacity for the past 6 months. While this work historically was \npartially supported through the UCP, Florence Project is currently drawing on other funds \nto try to ensure that children who turn 18 in custody have options for release and do not \nexperience the trauma of being moved to adult immigration detention. Furthermore, the \nFlorence Project had received referrals for children ORR is intending to potentially transfer \nto the local Unaccompanied Refugee Minor Program, and FIRRP would be unable to offer \nrepresentation to children in the program, resulting in a potential loss of counsel for the \nchildren. \n8.  Additionally, last week, five clients were targeted under DHS’ so-called “missing children” \nvisits, despite the children having active cases at USCIS and not actually being missing. In \nevery case, Florence Project attorneys have had to work with our clients and their sponsors \n \n1 See Garcia Ramirez v. ICE, No. CV 18-508 (RC), 2021 WL 4284530, at *8, *14 (D.D.C.

I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining\nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-17) as if fully set forth herein.\n2. My name is Elizabeth Sanchez Kennedy, and I am the Executive Director at the Galveston-\nHouston Immigrant Representation Project. GHIRP is a legal services organization that\nwas launched in October 2020 with a mission to build a resilient, diverse community by\nproviding comprehensive representation and holistic legal services to immigrants in need.\nGHIRP’s legal services range from outreach and education to complex litigation in the\nGalveston-Houston  area.  Our  legal  team  provides  holistic  and  comprehensive\nrepresentation to immigrants in the community, including unaccompanied minors, adults,\nand women, children, and families.\n3. Despite the partial contract termination, GHIRP’s Immigrant Children & Youth team\ncontinues to provide legal services to detained and released unaccompanied immigrant\nchildren in the Galveston-Houston area. For example, since this lawsuit was filed, GHIRP\nhas performed the following work for existing clients: filed six I-765 applications, two I-\n589 applications, two motions to terminate, one motion to reopen, one T-visa application,\nand at least eleven (11) filings in state court for clients who qualify for Special Immigrant\nJuvenile status; and attended two hearings in Immigration Court and two hearings in state\ncourt. We are relying on general operations funding (reserved for other purposes and\nprograms) to continue meeting our ethical obligations to our clients, including filing\ndeadlines and court appearances, and serve children with emergency needs that have arisen\nsince  the  partial  contract  termination.    GHIRP  management  will  implement  staffing\ndecisions, including layoffs, next week.\n4. GHIRP’s casework continues at a high volume, as the courts are moving forward on cases\nand the detained dockets are moving at an expedited pace. In the next month, nine (9) of\nour clients have hearings in Immigration Court, including one Individual Hearing. GHIRP\nattorneys also have multiple hearings in state court scheduled for later this month for clients\nwho could lose eligibility for Special Immigrant Juvenile status if we are not able to prove\nup their cases.\n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 378\n\n(407 of 956), Page 407 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 407 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-6     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 4\n5. GHIRP mentors and supervises pro bono attorneys we have engaged on several clients’\ncases, particularly in the state court proceedings that provides the basis to seek Special\nImmigrant Juvenile status.  We often recruit and engage pro bono attorneys to handle this\nportion  of  the  immigration  case  because  it  can  be  time  consuming,  procedurally\ncomplicated,  and  very  fact-specific.  Among  our  clients  with  pending  state  court\nproceedings by pro bono attorneys are two sisters, ages 14 and 15, from Central America,\nwho currently live in Galveston with their grandmother, and were previously abandoned\nby their father. GHIRP represents the girls in their Immigration Court proceedings and our\nlegal team needs to be able to provide ongoing mentorship to the pro bono attorney who is\nhandling their case in the local court.\n6. GHIRP’s legal team has continued preparing pro se detained children for their hearings in\nimmigration court and provides “Friend of Court” services for those required to appear\nbefore the Immigration Judge. After the implementation of so-called ‘rocket dockets’\nnationwide, the local ICE Field Office Juvenile Coordinators (FOJC) filed Notices to\nAppear immediately for the currently detained children. Cases are being fast-tracked, and\nchildren are being rapidly scheduled for Master Calendar Hearings on the Houston detained\njuvenile docket.\n7. On April 2, 2025, a GHIRP attorney appeared as Friend of Court for the detained docket.\nThe Immigration Judge asked about the status of the funding and exclaimed her gratitude\nwhen  we  informed  her  that  we  would  continue  providing  these  services,  at  least\ntemporarily. She told our attorney that we are “invaluable” to her and explained that the\nprior week had been very difficult because many detained children at other facilities had\nhearings, but no ORR-funded attorneys had appeared as Friend of Court due to the loss of\nfunding.\n8. Through GHIRP’s non-representational legal services at our two assigned ORR facilities,\nwe have encountered several children requiring immediate legal assistance. The children\nwould have previously been categorized as mandatory or priority representation cases\nunder the contract activities requirements. However, now we face the difficult decision of\nrepresenting the children without funding or leaving them to fend for themselves in\nsituations that almost certainly will result in their immediate deportation.\n9. Among the detained children we have met recently is a tender aged child who was taken\ninto immigration custody after a local traffic stop. Immigration officials placed him in ORR\ncustody  which  separated  from  his  parents,  who  have  lawful  status,  and  he  is  now\nexperiencing extreme trauma exacerbated by the fact that he is at imminent risk of\ndeportation.  Additionally,  GHIRP  is  working  with  five  siblings  who  were  recently\norphaned en route to the United States.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-8) as if fully set forth herein. \n2.  I am the Director of Legal Services of the Children’s Representation Project (“CRP”) at \nImmigrant Defenders Law Center (“ImmDef”), where I have been employed for almost ten \nyears. ImmDef is a non-profit organization headquartered in Los Angeles, California, with \nadditional offices in Santa Ana, Riverside and San Diego. ImmDef believes in providing \nuniversal representation so that no immigrant is forced to face removal proceedings without \nan attorney or accredited representative at their side. ImmDef is the largest provider of \nlegal  services  to  unaccompanied  children  in  California  and  currently  provides  legal \nservices to children housed in seventeen Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) facilities \nthroughout Southern California. ImmDef also represents thousands of unaccompanied \nchildren who have been released from ORR and are residing with sponsors in the Greater \nLos Angeles area.   \n3.  On April 1, 2025, as a result of the March 21, 2025, near total termination of funding for \nlegal services for unaccompanied children, ImmDef laid off twenty-four staff out of the \n113 employees previously funded under the Unaccompanied Children’s Program (“UCP”). \nSupervisors are struggling to redistribute work and ensure no balls are dropped.  Support \nthat was previously available to attorneys to best represent clients is now unavailable.  For \nexample, we were forced to lay off multiple case managers who provided key social \nservices  support  for  our  child  clients.    Case  managers  assist  children  with  school \nenrollment, housing insecurity, and other social services needs they require to adjust to a \nnew community and culture.  As I stated in my prior declaration, most of our child clients \nare indigent, so having staff assist them in accessing social services is key to their ability \nto participate meaningfully in their immigration cases-- a child facing homelessness is not \nlikely to be able to focus on keeping appointments with their attorney.  We also know that \nour child clients often face barriers in accessing school enrollment, due to linguistic and \ncultural challenges, or schools not understanding their sponsor’s authority to enroll them \nin school.  Our child clients, and thus our mission to provide comprehensive immigration \nrepresentation, will suffer without this key support.   \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 382\n\n(411 of 956), Page 411 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 411 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-7     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 6\n4.  We also laid off multiple members of our legal assistant team.  These team members were \nsome of the first points of contact for clients and their families and played a key role in \nmaintaining  files,  submitting  filings  and  supporting  our  client  representation.    As \nmentioned in my prior declaration, we have over 1,900 open cases funded under the \nterminated UCP program, and over 3,000 open cases organization wide. In such a high-\nvolume practice, administrative support is key to ensuring that nothing falls through the \ncracks and that our ethical responsibilities to our clients are faithfully discharged.  Without \nthis support, even more burden will fall on our attorney team at a time of incredible stress, \nand at a time when unaccompanied children’s cases are being expedited through the \ndeportation process. \n5.  We were also forced to lay off multiple members of our Detained Youth Empowerment \nProject.  In addition to providing Know Your Rights presentations and legal screenings \n(which were not immediately terminated under CLIN1), these team members played an \nincredibly important role in the provision of CLIN2 services.  They were some of the first \nfriendly faces detained children saw in the United States, and were key sources of stability \nand empathy for children under incredible stress. These team members made referrals to \nthe Young Center for Immigrant Children’s rights as well as to legal services for children \nwho will reunify with a sponsor outside our service area.  They also provide planning \nsupport for children aging out of ORR custody.  This age-out support is crucial, especially \nas we expect to see more children turn eighteen and “age out” of ORR care due to changing \nORR policies which make it increasingly difficult for children to be reunified with family \nmembers. Laid off staff prepared unrepresented children for court appearances and assisted \nwith the provision of “Friend of Court” services.  They heard shelter conditions concerns \nfrom children and elevated them to ORR subcontracted facility members and ORR officials \nto ensure children’s rights are respected while in government care.  All of these services \nwere defunded.   \n6.  In an attempt to retain specialized attorney staff members, we transferred one attorney from \nthe Children’s Representation Project onto another grant, rather than hiring externally for \nthat role.   With  a hiring freeze in place, we cannot replace  him on the Children’s \nRepresentation Project. Instead, other attorneys in the Children’s Representation Project \nwill now have to absorb his cases into their already growing caseloads.  Additionally, three \nstaff  members  tendered  their  resignations  in  March  and  early  April  because  of  the \nuncertainty created by the UCP program termination and the fear they might soon be laid \noff.   As mentioned in my previous declaration, our reserves will only last about six months.  \nIf the funding is not restored, additional layoffs impacting all positions would be required, \nwith disastrous consequences for our child clients and on our mission. \n7.  In  addition  to  the  layoffs,  resignations  and  reassignments,  there  have  been  multiple \nimmediate impacts on the children we serve.  After the UCP program partial termination, \nwe reached out to the ORR-subcontracted facilities we service to let them know we could \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 383\n\n(412 of 956), Page 412 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 412 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-7     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 6\nnot retain new clients.  Some Long-Term Foster care programs had just accepted new \nchildren, and asked us what to do, since the children would now be without counsel.  The \ngovernment’s complete lack of a stop gap plan has left us with no guidance with which to \naddress these concerns.  Emergencies in these detained unaccompanied children’s cases \nare ongoing despite their lack of access to representation. One child ages out in just a couple \nmonths, and is losing precious time to apply for relief every day that passes they are without \ncounsel. Other recently arrived children now face being warehoused until they are deported \nor age out.  Without funding and with layoffs on the table, we were unfortunately unable \nto offer these children representation.  The subcontracted facilities asked if they should \nstop accepting children since they will lack access to counsel, and I had to tell them that \nevery single LSP in the country is facing the same drastic cut, and likely every detained \nchild in the nation would be unable to access counsel. \n8.  Even  children  with  counsel  are  experiencing  additional  hurdles  to  their  ongoing \nrepresentation.  The week after the termination, a child we represent who speaks a Mayan \nlanguage had to be prepared for an upcoming hearing.  Our access to interpretation services \nhad been terminated along with all representation services, and the child’s attorney was \nunable  to  communicate  with  him.  Though  ImmDef  has  a  direct  contract  with  an \ninterpretation service and could thankfully pay out of pocket for these services (at least for \nnow), that interpretation service does not offer Mayan languages. The attorney had to seek \na continuance in immigration court due to the inability to communicate with her client, \ndelaying the proceedings needlessly. \n9.  The program termination also places children in danger.  The week after the termination, \nImmDef staff learned of a significant, potentially life-threatening safety incident impacting \na detained infant.  In addition to placing the baby’s safety at risk, the incident also likely \nimpacted their eligibility for legal relief.  Because of the seriousness of the situation, \nImmDef stepped in to offer support and advocacy on the child’s behalf, knowing we would \nlikely not be compensated for this work.  The UCP program termination has put us in a \nposition that forces attorneys to choose between their moral duty to protect an infant from \nharm and working without compensation. \n10. The UCP program termination has also had immediate impacts on stakeholders.  As \nmentioned above, ORR subcontracted facilities are at a loss about what to do for children \nin their care who are in imminent need of representation.  The same day as the UCP \nprogram termination, on March 21, 2025, we learned that ORR-subcontracted facilities \nwere warned by ORR to prepare for expedited removal hearings for detained children.  \nOver the past week, we saw those hearings roll out as subcontracted facilities struggled to \nunderstand their responsibilities and how to make the children available for these expedited \nhearings.  \n3 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 384\n\n(413 of 956), Page 413 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 413 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-7     Filed 04/04/25     Page 5 of 6\n11. At the detained juvenile docket held April 2, 2025, ImmDef represented all the children at \nfacilities we serve who were scheduled on that docket and appeared on their behalf despite \nthe fact that funding has not been restored in light of our ethical responsibilities to our \nclients.  The week following the UCP program termination and again on April 2, the \nImmigration Judge asked whether ImmDef would be able to provide Friend of Court \nservices because they help the hearings run much more smoothly and efficiently.  He \npressed the attorney appearing to find a solution that would allow us to continue to serve \nas Friend of Court.  ImmDef was forced to advise him that we are assessing the situation, \nbecause as of now, funding has not been restored despite the TRO.  Without funding, there \nis no solution to be had. \n12. ImmDef has 15-25 immigration and state court hearings for children represented under the \nUCP program each week over the next month.  We had over twelve hearings scheduled for \nApril 2, alone.  We expect the number of hearings to increase as removal cases of detained \nchildren continue to be expedited.  Furthermore, after years of receiving very few asylum \ninterview notices due to backlogs at the asylum office, in late March, after the termination \nnotice, we received over ten asylum interview notices for the weeks of April 1 and April \n7, 2025, and expect to receive many more, as we have hundreds of pending asylum \napplications for unaccompanied children.  While no change in scheduling priorities has \nbeen announced by the asylum office, ImmDef and sister organizations across the nation \nhave reported that it appears unaccompanied children are suddenly being prioritized for \nasylum interview scheduling.  The preparation for an asylum interview can take multiple \nweeks and dozens of hours depending on the complexity of the case. The asylum interview \nitself is typically an all-day endeavor.  Interviews take place in Tustin, CA, about two hours \nfrom our headquarters.  It is typical to have to wait two to three hours past the scheduled \ninterview time, if not more, and the interview itself can take multiple hours.  It is not clear \nhow, without funding, we will be able to continue to represent these children at their \nhearings and interviews, but to withdraw now would seriously prejudice their cases.  It is \nalso not clear how we will be able to continue to sustain the increased workload caused by \nexpedited hearings and asylum interviews if we are further forced to reduce staff in the \ncoming weeks. \n13. Unfortunately, ImmDef knows firsthand that filling this kind of gap with the assistance of \npro bono counsel is simply not practicable.  Shortly after its founding, ImmDef created a \npro bono program in which we placed our more straightforward children’s cases with pro \nbono counsel and provided them with mentorship.  Recruitment was a challenge, requiring \na full-time pro bono coordinator as well as other support staff to try to identify sufficient \npro bono counsel to take on even a fraction of our child clients.  We placed the more \n“straightforward” cases (meaning not as legally complex and cases where the child hadn’t \nexperienced extreme trauma) with pro bono attorneys because we knew that pro bono \nattorneys typically lacked the specialized training and experience to handle more complex \n4 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 385\n\n(414 of 956), Page 414 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 414 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-7     Filed 04/04/25     Page 6 of 6\nmatters, even with mentorship.  More complex cases, or cases with serious trauma or other \ncomplicating factors had to remain with our specialized staff attorneys. Unfortunately, we \nfound that, while we appreciated pro bono attorneys’ generosity with their time and \nwillingness to help, they typically lacked the language skills and cultural responsiveness to \nbe able to build rapport with their child clients.  They also needed intensive training on an \nongoing basis due to the rapidly changing nature of immigration law.  Even with these \nsupports, we found that pro bono counsel unfortunately made mistakes that prejudiced or \ncould prejudice their clients and in many instances, ImmDef ended up “taking back” a \nclient that was previously placed with pro bono counsel either because of such mistakes or \nbecause the pro bono attorney requested us to when they came to fully appreciate the \namount of work representing unaccompanied children entailed.  Another issue was that \nimmigration cases can take years, and many pro bono attorneys left their firms during the \npendency of the case, asking ImmDef to take it back upon their departure.  Furthermore, \nany cases we did place with pro bono attorneys were never while the child was actively in \nthe custody of ORR.  This is because in order to represent a child in government custody, \nan individual needs to go through extensive background checks, including fingerprinting \nand other background checks to ensure the children’s safety.  These clearances can take \nseveral weeks if not longer to obtain, making it impracticable for pro bono attorneys to \nrepresent detained children, especially in light of recent expedited hearings.  In sum, while \nwe appreciated the generosity of the attorneys who volunteered, found that the pro bono \nmodel was a much less efficient and effective way to provide legal representation to \nunaccompanied children and we terminated our pro bono program as a result of these \nchallenges.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 3rd of April 2025, in Riverside, CA. \n   \n__________________________  \nMarion (\"Mickey\") Donovan-Kaloust  \nImmigrant Defenders Law Center  \n634 S.

Pursuant to \n28  U.S.C. § 1746,  I  certify  under penalty of perjury that  the  following  statement  is  true  and \ncorrect.  \n1.  I incorporate my March 25, 2025 Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a \nTemporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-18) as if fully set forth \nherein. \n2.  My name is Wendy Young, and I am the President of KIND, Inc., doing business as Kids \nin  Need  of  Defense  (“KIND”).  KIND  is  the  leading  international  not-for-profit \norganization  devoted  to  protecting  the  rights  and  well-being  of  unaccompanied  and \nseparated children.  Founded in 2008, KIND grew to seventeen locations across the United \nStates, providing legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children during and after their \ntime in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) of the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS). \n3.  KIND’s subcontract with Acacia Center for Justice, incepted in March 2022, supported the \nemployment of legal services, psychosocial services, and program support professionals \nacross KIND’s seventeen locations in the United States.  These employees include lawyers \nrepresenting child clients in their immigration matters and directing or delivering related \nservices; paralegals supporting case work and delivering know-your-rights programs and \nlegal screenings; lawyers providing training, practice guidance, and mentorship to pro bono \nattorneys who represent child clients; social work professionals delivering psychosocial \nservices and referrals to child clients; and a range of employees supporting program \noperations  through  functions  such  as  program  management  and  support,  pro  bono \npartnership support, training, legal technical assistance, technology support, and data \nmanagement. As of March 21, 2025, the subcontract supported approximately 350 full-\ntime positions.  \n4.  When the Acacia contract was partially terminated with immediate effect, staff engaged to \nserve children under the subcontract were required to stop performing many key functions \nof their roles, and KIND was deprived of funding needed to support their employment. \nAccordingly, on March 27, 2025, KIND laid off over 240 staff members in legal services, \npsychosocial services, and other program support roles, whose last day of employment at \nKIND was March 31, 2025, and has informed additional staff of termination dates in the \ncoming months.  Absent restoration of the contract services and funding at March 20, 2025 \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 388\n\n(417 of 956), Page 417 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 417 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-8     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 4\nlevels, KIND will not only be unable to re-hire for the vacated positions, but also expects \nthat the referenced additional layoffs will be necessary.   \n5.  Because of the partial contract termination, KIND plans to consolidate the remaining \noperations of certain offices within a general region into a single location – specifically, a \nsingle location to house parts of the operations of KIND’s locations serving Northern \nVirginia,  Baltimore,  MD,  and  Washington,  DC;  and  a  single  location  to  house  the \nremaining programming of KIND’s New York and Newark locations.  Also due to the \npartial contract  termination, KIND expects to close several offices and reduce its footprint.       \n \n6.  In connection with the loss of funding, the layoffs, and in anticipation of such office \nclosures, KIND instructed staff to begin contacting thousands of clients who were being \nserved under the contract to inform them that, due to a loss of funding, their KIND attorneys \nwould be forced to seek permission to withdraw any appearances as counsel before \nimmigration courts, state courts, and USCIS, and to end their legal services.  KIND further \ninstructed staff to begin preparing motions or requests to the relevant tribunals to substitute \nother counsel or to withdraw as counsel, where permitted by relevant rules of professional \nconduct.  Meanwhile, KIND instructed staff to continue critical ongoing work necessary \nto fulfill professional responsibilities to clients, including meeting filing deadlines and \nattending scheduled hearings and administrative interviews with clients. \n \n7.  In parallel, KIND asked experienced pro bono partners and community partners to take \nover cases from KIND.  Initial efforts resulted in placing a small fraction of the thousands \nof clients whose lawyers are no longer employed with KIND, with efforts continuing. \nKIND attributes the limited number of placements to several factors. Most pro bono \nattorneys whose primary practice area is not immigration law will prefer to receive a high \ndegree of training and mentorship, due to the complexity of children’s immigration matters \nand the additional challenges of serving a client who is a child.  The cutbacks of services \nassociated with the partial contract termination have severely curtailed KIND’s staffing for \npro  bono  recruiting  and  mentorship,  in  turn  limiting  the  availability  of  one-on-one \nmentorship on which pro bono attorneys have relied. At the same time, with the advent of \nmore restrictive immigration policies, demand for  free immigration legal services is \nsurging, so pro bono attorneys and immigration nonprofits offering free legal services face \nincreased demands on their available time.   \n \n8.  In the 60 days between this date and June 2, 2025, over 300 clients served through KIND \nare scheduled to attend hearings or interviews, including both master calendar and merits \nhearings in immigration court, asylum interviews with USCIS, and state court appearances \nin matters relating to guardianship, custody, or dependency. Due to the partial contract \ntermination and ensuing layoffs at KIND, many of these clients must prepare for and attend \nthese events with an unfamiliar attorney taking the place of a longstanding attorney.

Such \ndisruption of continuity compounds the uncertainty around an already stressful event, and \nburdens a child’s efforts to participate in proceedings to the best of their ability.     \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 4th of April 2025, in Falls Church, Virginia. \n \n  /s/ Wendy Young      \nWendy Young \nPresident \nKids in Need of Defense \n3 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 390\n\n(419 of 956), Page 419 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 419 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-9     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nMIGUEL A.

MEXICANO FURMANSKA \nOWNER AND MANAGER OF LAW OFFICE OF MIGUEL MEXICANO PC \n  \nI, Miguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska, make the following statements on behalf of myself and Law \nOffice of Miguel Mexicano.  I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true \nand correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-19) as if fully set forth herein. \n2.  I, Miguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska, serve as Managing Attorney and Proprietor of the \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano, PC. \n \n3.  Since submitting my initial declaration, the financial impact of the contract termination has \nintensified substantially. I have been forced to implement immediate austerity measures, \nincluding reducing all team members' hours and instituting furloughs for two attorneys and \ntwo support staff members. Without restoration of funding within the next 21 days, I will \nhave  no  alternative  but  to  terminate  employment  for  at  least  four  staff  members \nrepresenting almost half of our dedicated team. The abrupt and unanticipated nature of the \ncontract termination has left our firm without sufficient reserves to fulfill our financial \nobligations to departing staff, including legally mandated final wages and accrued paid \ntime off. Consequently, I will be compelled to incur significant personal debt to meet these \nobligations, as our firm's limited remaining resources are insufficient to cover these costs. \nThe long-term prospects for the Law Office of Miguel Mexicano are increasingly dire. \nWithout immediate intervention, I anticipate the near dissolution of our legal team in the \ncoming  months,  leaving  me  as  the  sole  remaining  attorney.  This  would  render  me \npersonally responsible for approximately 120 immigration cases—a caseload that far \nexceeds what any individual practitioner could ethically manage.  \n \n4.  Since the termination order, my legal team has fulfilled our ethical obligations by attending \napproximately twelve court appearances without compensation, striving to protect our \nclients' interests despite the contract's abrupt end. We have endeavored to manage our \nsubstantial caseload with significantly reduced staffing, but continuing this volume of \nuncompensated work is financially unsustainable. Despite our unwavering commitment to \nthese vulnerable children, our capacity to maintain effective representation will inevitably \ndiminish and, absent restored funding, will completely cease in the near future. This \nimminent collapse of legal services will leave dozens of children to navigate complex \nimmigration proceedings alone, jeopardizing their legal rights and potentially their safety. \n \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 392\n\n(421 of 956), Page 421 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 421 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-9     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 3\n5.  On a personal level, the past ten days have been one of the most challenging and distressing \nperiods  in  my  professional  life.  Throughout  my  nearly  twelve-year  career  as  an \nimmigration attorney, I have never encountered such profound despair or professional \nuncertainty.  Having  dedicated  my  practice  to  protecting  society's  most  vulnerable \nindividuals, I find it inconceivable that the government would abruptly withdraw funding \nfor these essential legal services for unaccompanied children. These services stand as their \nsole protection against  deportation to potentially life-threatening  circumstances. This \nsudden abandonment not only undermines the children's legal rights but also betrays the \ncore humanitarian principles that have guided this field for decades. \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 2 of April 2025, in Los Angeles, California. \n ______________________________  \nMiguel Angel Mexicano Furmanska \nOwner and Managing Attorney \nLaw Office of Miguel Mexicano PC \n \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 393\n\n(422 of 956), Page 422 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 422 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 8\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST  SUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al.,  ANA RAQUEL DEVEREAUX (MIRC) \n  IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFFS’ \nPlaintiffs,  MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION  \nv.   \n \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n   \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 394\n\n(423 of 956), Page 423 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 423 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 2 of 8\n \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF ANA RAQUEL DEVEREAUX \nSENIOR MANAGING ATTORNEY AT MICHIGAN IMMIGRANT RIGHTS CENTER  \n \nI, Ana Raquel Devereaux, make the following statements on behalf of myself and the Michigan \nImmigrant Rights Center (“MIRC”).  I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement \nis true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-6) as if fully set forth herein. \n2.  My name is Ana Raquel Devereaux, and I am a Senior Managing Attorney at the Michigan \nImmigrant Rights Center (hereinafter, “MIRC”). MIRC is a non-profit organization that \nprovides free legal services for children and other non-citizens who have suffered abuse, \ntrafficking,  and  persecution.  MIRC  is  the  only  organization  serving  unaccompanied \nchildren in the custody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (hereinafter, “ORR”) in \nMichigan  and  the  primary  organization  providing  legal  services  to  children  in  the \nunaccompanied refugee minor program in Michigan and to children released from ORR \ncustody to sponsors in Michigan.  \n3.  Michigan Immigrant Rights Center (MIRC) is a legal resource center for Michigan's \nimmigrant communities. MIRC works to build a thriving Michigan where immigrant \ncommunities experience equity and belonging. The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center is \na program of  Michigan Statewide Advocacy Services (MSAS). MIRC has five local \noffices  throughout  the  state  of  Michigan  which  provide  direct  legal  services  to \nunaccompanied children and also provide general community immigration legal services. \nOur five local offices are located in Detroit, Ypsilanti, Lansing, Grand Rapids, and \nKalamazoo. These five offices are supported by a statewide structure within MIRC to \nprovide training, administrative and supervisory support, community engagement, and pro \nbono support.  \n4.  Since the drafting of our prior declaration, MIRC moved forward with logistics for \nimplementing largescale layoffs based on the loss of funding. Originally, we planned to \ngive staff notice on April 1, 2025. While MIRC was able to secure some other funding and \nplanned to shift some staff to other funded work, the layoffs would have involved the \nmajority of staff who had been employed under the Acacia contract. We intended to \nprovide staff with notice according to their employment contracts and some additional \nseverance benefits. The funding for the staff notice period and severance benefits is coming \nexclusively from MIRC’s reserves and totals about $1.5 million. We had set the April 1st \ntimeframe expecting to learn about the funding by the end of the original option year 2 \ncontracting period, which concluded on March 29, 2025. However, with the loss of CLINs \n2, 3, and 4 on March 21st, the time between March 21 and April 1st is additional time of \npaying for staff time without funding. That additional time totals about $500,000 so far. \nDespite the additional cost, when CLINs 2, 3, and 4 were terminated, MIRC leadership \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 395\n\n(424 of 956), Page 424 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 424 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 8\ndecided  that  it  was  worth  keeping  our  originally  scheduled  April  1st  timeframe  for \nproviding layoff notices so that we could receive further information on any funding \nbeyond Option Year 2 of the contract and because of the very significant level of logistics \ninvolved in preparing to provide appropriate notice and communication to over 100 \nemployees about their employment status, rights, and benefits.  \n5.  Upon learning of the hearing on the temporary restraining order scheduled in the instant \ncase on April 1st, we moved our date for communicating layoffs to April 7, 2025. In light \nof the temporary restraining order in this case, we are awaiting future decisions in this case \nbefore scheduling a new date for the layoffs and related staff communications.  \n6.  If there is not a permanent injunction in this case, permanently enjoining ORR from \nwithdrawing funding from legal services for unaccompanied children for the duration of \nthe appropriations period, we will immediately schedule a time to communicate layoffs to \nstaff. This will involve immediate layoffs (after completing the notice periods in their \nemployment contracts) of staff whose work was covered under CLINs 2, 3, and 4, and \ndelayed layoffs for staff doing work under CLIN 1 since the government has only provided \na six-month extension for that work and has clearly signaled they are not intending to \ncontinue funding that work. \n7.  It is very important to note that at the time of the writing of this declaration more than one \nfull business day from the issuance of the temporary restraining order, ORR has not issued \na new or restored contract for CLINs 2, 3, and 4. So it is not clear when or how the \ngovernment intends to comply with the order. This gives MIRC significant additional \nfinancial concern and we have to continue to make decisions without the contract in place, \ndespite the TRO being in place. Without a restored contract, we continue to use funding \nfrom our reserves and other parts of our organizational budgets, which affects our work \noverall, our ability to fulfill our commitment to our other funders, and puts into significant \njeopardy what other severance benefits we may be able to offer our laid off staff in the \nevent of no permanent injunction in this case. \n8.  As a result of the temporary restraining order, we have delayed staff layoffs for a second \ntime. But knowing that layoffs are forthcoming is absolutely devastating to staff morale \nand our ability to retain highly-trained, skilled staff who have built critical rapport with our \nchild clients. While the delay has provided some reprieve for clients and staff, staff \ncontinue to be impacted knowing that layoffs were planned and are still looming until a \nresolution of this lawsuit and the government’s compliance with the court’s order. Since \nthe writing of our prior declaration, we have gotten eleven more resignations of staff \nmembers and we get a new one almost every day. Almost every one of the departing staff \nmembers specifically state in their resignation letters that they love working at MIRC and \nare departing because of the funding uncertainty, with the most recent resignation letter \nspecifically stating, \nGood afternoon, I am writing to provide you all with notification of my resignation \nfrom MIRC. I want to be completely clear that the one and only reason for my \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 396\n\n(425 of 956), Page 425 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 425 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 8\nresignation is funding instability; I love everything about this job and everyone I \nwork  with.  My  supervisors  in  Grand  Rapids  have  been  nothing  short  of \nextraordinary, and I have learned so much in my time here. I’m inspired daily by \nour work and our mission. [...]Thank you so much for such an incredible experience \nand opportunity, and for the ongoing support shown to the staff in these difficult \ntimes. I will always be so proud of having been part of the MIRC family.  \n9.  These resignations include some of our most experienced attorneys and other essential \nstaff. Our ability to hire replacement staff will be hindered by the general public insecurity \nwith federal contracts at this moment and to be even more clear, ORR’s stop work and \ntermination orders over the past six weeks.  \n10. Even if we are able to hire to replace the staff who have departed, my direct experience in \nleading  MIRC’s  extremely  successful  hiring  efforts,  specifically  for  staff  serving \nunaccompanied children, the incoming staff will mostly be new to the practice of law, \nimmigration law, and working with unaccompanied children. So the training and time \nneeded to bring those potentially new staff up to the level of our staff who departed due to \nthe funding uncertainty will be very difficult during this time of transition Likely, the \ninterim burdens to onboard in this environment will put even more pressure on existing \nstaff and lead to further resignations, thereby compounding and worsening these effects..  \n11. Another  cost  of  ORR’s  termination  of  funding  for  representational  services  for \nunaccompanied children has been the over 130 staff hours I, along with senior MIRC \nleadership, have devoted to planning for layoffs, the funds spent on seeking employment \nlaw and human resources advice to ensure we are complying with legal requirements and \nfollowing best practices in deciding on and carrying out layoffs.  \n12. While waiting to put into action a layoff plan, MIRC staff have been continuing to work \non the cases of currently represented unaccompanied children, but even this has been \ntailored to account for the funding uncertainty and the possibility of staff layoffs in the \nimmediate future. We have had staff working on emergency aspects of these cases but \nrefrained from taking other case actions that would make it harder for us to withdraw in \nthe near future. In practice, we are primarily limiting the filings and appearances our staff \nare doing on behalf of unaccompanied children in state court, unless there is an imminent \ndeadline. These state court cases will be much harder to withdraw from, so we are waiting \nuntil we know the funding is fully restored before we return to doing that work for our \nchild clients.  \n13. If a preliminary injunction is not issued in this case, we will proceed to almost immediate \nlayoff notices and those will be followed by a plan which we will share the following \nbusiness day after layoff notices that will direct our staff to begin withdrawing from all \ncases previously funded by ORR where we have not been able to obtain alternate funding, \nwhich is more than 800 cases. \n14. Since  March  21,  2025  and  until  ORR  provides  a  restored  or  new  contract  for \nrepresentational services, MIRC has not taken any new cases of children in ORR custody. \n3 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 397\n\n(426 of 956), Page 426 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 426 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 5 of 8\nWe receive daily emails from staff at ORR facilities asking us to take the cases and or offer \nsome stop-gap services. Each week, the Detroit immigration court has at least one docket \nday dedicated to unaccompanied children. Moreover, with the expansion of rocket dockets \nfor unaccompanied children in removal proceedings across the country, we, too, have seen \nmaster calendar cases reset for our currently-represented clients as well as new children in \nORR custody.  We continue to represent our clients who have master calendar hearings by \neither appearing in  court fully or offering friend-of-the-court services, all unfunded, \nincluding all seventeen hearings that occurred yesterday, April 3rd. Additionally, we have \nreceived multiple requests for representing children in custody at the newly scheduled \nhearings yesterday and upcoming April 7th and this will continue indefinitely. Unless, or \nuntil, ORR restores the funding as ordered by the temporary restraining order, we must \ndecline to represent these children at their hearings for funding reasons. The same would \nbe true and in even greater measure if the preliminary injunction is not granted. \n15. One  specific  example  of  these  requests  involved  the  ORR  subcontractor  practically \nbegging MIRC to take a child’s case because they had been scheduled for a master calendar \nhearing and asking what other resources we could provide if we couldn’t represent the \nchild. In this chain, eventually, an employee from ORR told the sub-contractor that “most \n[Legal Service Providers] already serve as \"friends of court\" but maybe they are still able \nto offer this on the side,” ignoring the fact that ORR chose to cut the funding for these \nfriend of the court services specifically as part of the termination of CLIN 2.  \n16. In another instance, an ORR sub-contractor asked MIRC to represent a child in short-term \ncustody who was suddenly scheduled for a master calendar hearing and we had to decline \nbecause we have no funding to take on new cases and are using up other MIRC funding to \ncarry the unaccompanied children’s cases we already have. After we declined, they told us \nthey found another pro bono attorney to take the case. Yet two days before the hearing, the \nshelter staff and the Young Center advocate for the child reached out again to see if MIRC \ncould take the case. They specifically referenced the news of the temporary restraining \norder and assumed that we would now have funding to do this work, which has yet to be \nrestored. It is clear that ORR is not providing internal communication to its staff on the \nground and its sub-contractors about the state of the funding for legal services and how \nORR intends to ensure children receive these services. Additionally, we don’t yet have the \ndetails as to what happened with the pro bono attorney who had seemingly committed to \ntaking the case, but it is a clear example of the harm in the termination of the funding, even \nwhen MIRC has been expending significant other resources coming from other crucial \nservices to cover a large portion of the gap. \n17. The example above of a pro bono attorney’s inability to actual step in and cover the \nrepresentational needs of even one hearing is only the beginning of the picture we can paint \nof how pro bono attorneys in Michigan are unable supplant the funded legal services work \nfor unaccompanied children. Since the termination of CLINs 2, 3, and 4, we have been \nusing our funding reserves to continue to staff our pro bono mentors and coordinators for \nthe time being, and even in this situation where we are covering what ORR should have \n4 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 398\n\n(427 of 956), Page 427 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 427 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 6 of 8\nbeen funding, pro bono attorneys cannot even begin to assist unaccompanied child clients \nin Michigan. \n18. As a result of the loss of funding for the representation of unaccompanied children, MIRC’s \npro bono team specifically has been engaged in pro bono attorney recruitment efforts with \nthe intent of putting together a list of pro bono attorneys that ORR sub-contractors can \nreach out to for the unaccompanied children’s cases. Only nine attorneys have signed up \nfor the list. Most of them only speak English. Most of them indicated they could not appear \nin all of the forums required for the representation of unaccompanied children. All of them \nindicate they require mentorship or support from MIRC. We are still working to determine \ntheir true ability to take these cases for full representation and do so without mentorship, \nbut, based on my ten years leading this work in Michigan, I can confidently state that pro \nbono is not the answer to address these funding cuts. For further context, over the past year, \nMIRC has dedicated considerable time to placing these cases with pro bono attorneys and \noffered  to  provide  unlimited  training,  mentorship,  language  assistance,  covering  the \nclient’s court and filing fees, and assisting with other logistics. In that time, not one attorney \ntook a case of an unaccompanied child in Michigan (including those who are now \nindicating they are interested in taking cases).  \n19. Law firms have told MIRC that they are only interested in doing short-term pro bono work \n(usually about a commitment of one day) because of the high turnover rates of their staff. \nAdditionally, we have been told by firms who once took a few unaccompanied children’s \ncases that they no longer wish to do that type of pro bono work because they don’t like \ndealing with the realities of unaccompanied children. \n20. The few who often show interest in volunteering at a higher time commitment level are \nretired attorneys who have no experience in immigration law and no office resources, \nincluding  meeting  space,  technology,  malpractice  insurance,  administrative  support, \ninterpretation, and so on. So while they may have time and interest, they cannot provide \npro bono legal services to unaccompanied children without the full infrastructure of \nMIRC’s  mentorship,  offices,  malpractice  insurance,  technology,  and  administrative \nresources.  \n21. A reality in Michigan is that pro bono is not a requirement for those licensed in Michigan \nand so there is little incentive for attorneys to offer their services in a pro bono context. \nEven those who try to offer pro bono services from a place of charitable intentions lack the \nresources or full commitment to do so, as demonstrated by the examples shared above.  \n22. We also recently offered two critical opportunities for training for pro bonos, one was in \nguardianships, to allow pro bono attorneys to take on a more short-term portion of these \nchildren’s cases that is essential to special immigrant juvenile status, and only one person \nattended, and has not accepted cases from that training. The other was on addressing \nsecondary trauma which is a key tool for doing this work healthily and sustainably, only \ntwo people attended. Even so, these trainings are ones we would not be able to offer without \nthis funding. \n5 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 399\n\n(428 of 956), Page 428 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 428 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 7 of 8\n23. Two additional realities that make pro bono an impossibility as a way to fulfill the \nobligation to provide legal services to unaccompanied is the high levels of logistical hurdles \nrequired for providing legal services to children, which pro bonos are unable to cross (either \nat all or unassisted) and the administrative burden of the local ORR subcontractors to have \nto establish an independent relationship with each pro bono lawyer for each case.  \n24. The first logistical hurdle is that ORR requires individuals working with children in custody \nto undergo essential background check processes and also to use high levels of encryption \nfor case data. The background checks can take weeks at best and months at worst. The \nencryption  is  expensive  and  requires  IT  expertise  to  ensure  compliance  with  these \nrequirements to safeguard the information of the children we are working with. These \nhurdles are very important and MIRC has dedicated significant staffing resources to \nensuring our staff comply with these requirements, but that is a barrier that pro bono \nattorneys struggle with, even with all the MIRC assistance we can provide to smooth the \npath to meeting these requirements. As an example, we have been trying to place a specific \ncase of a fourteen-year-old unaccompanied child in Michigan with a pro bono attorney \nsince December 2024. One attorney was interested but specifically declined due to the need \nto take time to do background checks. Another didn’t fully decline, but was not licensed in \nMichigan for the critical state court appearance, and never took proactive steps to complete \ntheir background check, so the case remains unplaced. Even if this case was placed, these \nattorneys would need ongoing funded support from MIRC to continue their work.  \n25. The other hurdle is accessing the children in custody. Pro bono attorneys are not generally \nwell-positioned to visit children in ORR facilities. In some of Michigan’s ORR short-term \nshelters, in particular, the children cannot be transported to lawyers offices and the shelters \nhave difficulty coordinating the logistics for universal access to lawyers through remote \ncommunication, even with significant planning and assistance, so pro bono attorneys would \nbe unable to even access these children. \n26. One  of  the  benefits  to  MIRC’s  provision  of  services  to  unaccompanied  children  in \nMichigan is that we are the only provider doing this work in the state and we are part of a \nunified and internally regulated network of legal service providers. When working with us, \nthe ORR subcontractors have centralized points of contact and uniform processes, we \ngather together every quarter to troubleshoot logistical challenges in service provision for \nthe children. Local ORR-subcontractor staff also know who in our management structure \nto reach out to if any individual attorney is not meeting the legal needs of the child they are \nworking with. None of this would be available if ORR looked to pro bono attorneys to \nfulfill the obligation of legal services to unaccompanied children. In our experience of \nworking with pro bonos who take cases in the adult context (since as I mentioned above, \nwe cannot get pro bonos to take cases of unaccompanied children in Michigan), a pro bono \nattorney can handle at most two or three cases at any given time, but most only take one, \nif any. So it would require 300-800 individual pro bono attorneys to provide the services \nin Michigan if MIRC was not funded for this work. And this is only for currently \nrepresented cases. That number will grow by at least 100-300 each year. These hypothetical \n6 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 400\n\n(429 of 956), Page 429 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 429 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-10     Filed 04/04/25     Page 8 of 8\n800 individual pro bono attorneys would not have the ability to organize themselves, and \nthere  would  be  no  supervision  structure  to  provide  coordination,  training,  and \naccountability since MIRC would not be funded to do this work without ORR restoring \nfunding for the provision of legal services. \n27. To be clear and knowing full well the beneficence within the pro bono legal community, \npro bono is not the answer to addressing the legal needs of all of these children after the \nfunding cuts.  \n28. The harm to Michigan’s unaccompanied children is already taking place (even despite the \nissuance of the temporary restraining order) and every day that follows more harm is \ncaused to children who are required to appear in immigration court without attorneys, and \nMIRC is suffering a daily loss of funding that was crucial to the provision of other essential \nservices, daily losing critical staff, and soon will have to let go of the majority of staff with \nthe expertise and experience to serve unaccompanied children and there will be no one left \nto do this work on behalf of unaccompanied children in Michigan if the funding is not \nreinstated.  \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \nExecuted on the 4th of April 2025, in Lansing, Michigan. \n ______________________________  \nAna Raquel Devereaux \nSenior Managing Attorney \nMichigan Immigrant Rights Center \n7 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 401\n\n(430 of 956), Page 430 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 430 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-11     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 4\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \n FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \n SAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN \nOF LISA KOOP (NIJC) IN SUPPORT \nEAST PALO ALTO, et al., \nOF PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \n  \nPRELIMINARY INJUNCTION  \n \n  \nPlaintiffs, \n  \nv. \nUNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF \nHEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, et al., \n  \nDefendants. \n  \n  \n   \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 402\n\n(431 of 956), Page 431 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 431 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-11     Filed 04/04/25     Page 2 of 4\nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF LISA KOOP \nNATIONAL DIRECTOR OF LEGAL SERVICES  \nFOR THE NATIONAL IMMIGRANT JUSTICE CENTER \n  \nI, Lisa Koop, make the following statements on behalf of myself and the National Immigrant Justice \nCenter (NIJC).

I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-13) as if fully set forth hererein. \n \n2.  My name is Lisa Koop. I am the National Director of Legal Services at the National \nImmigrant Justice Center (NIJC). NIJC is based in Chicago, Illinois and provides legal \nservices  to  immigrants.  NIJC  is  dedicated  to  providing  legal  services  to  indigent \nunaccompanied immigrant children who are not in detention as well as those held in the \ncustody of the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) in Illinois and Indiana.  \n \n3.  Since the ORR funding ceased, NIJC was forced to temporarily shift staff members to work \non other NIJC projects.  Without secured ORR funding, NIJC’s ability to continue its work \nof providing legal services to immigrant children through the Children’s Protection Project \nis at imminent risk, without drastic restructuring. \n \n4.  NIJC has urgent filings for immigrant children imminently due. For example, on Monday \nof this week, after years of very limited asylum interview scheduling by the government, \nNIJC received notice of three asylum interviews scheduled for the third week in April. \nNIJC has about 250 asylum matters for unaccompanied children pending before the \nChicago Asylum Office and expects more of those matters to be set for interviews in the \nnear future. NIJC has 43 special immigrant juvenile cases to be filed, with over half of \nthose cases awaiting state court hearings on requests for predicate orders. NIJC has about \nfour U-visa and four T-visa cases in urgent need of filing.   \n  \n5.  Staff at the ORR-funded children’s shelters and long-term foster care programs which \nhouse the immigrant children NIJC was funded to serve have asked NIJC staff to meet with \nchildren in their care. They report they are without recourse or answers for children when \nNIJC is unable to offer services to newly arrived children and has limited capacity to \nrespond to the legal needs of existing clients.    \n \n6.  Since the termination of funding from ORR for legal services for children, NIJC has \naggressively sought to recruit pro bono attorneys to represent immigrant children. NIJC \nhas requested to place pro bono cases with major law firms with offices in Chicago. Of \nthose firms, one firm has offered to take two cases following training by NIJC.

Several  of  NIJC’s  usual  partner  firms  have  suspended  acceptance  of  new \nimmigration matters due to messaging from the White House about pro bono involvement \nin immigration matters. Of the 250 children’s asylum matters NIJC is seeking to place with \npro bono attorneys, less than ten are likely to be placed in the coming weeks.  \n  \n7.  To equip pro bono attorneys to handle children’s asylum matters, NIJC has scheduled a \npro bono training the third week in April. Three NIJC asylum experts will prepare and \npresent that training, with support from NIJC’s pro bono manager. Pro bono attorneys who \nattend the training will receive intensive guidance from NIJC on asylum law and practice \nand best practices for working with immigrant children. To sustain a pro bono program, \nNIJC requires expert staff with significant experience who are available to support matters \nhandled by pro bono attorneys, who are not immigration law experts and often have little \nfamiliarity with the agencies and systems involved in children’s asylum matters. Without \nORR funding to maintain those pro bono support positions, NIJC will not be able to provide \npro bono attorneys with the support they expect and require to represent immigrant children.    \n  \n8.  Pro bono attorneys who accept matters through NIJC will typically only do so when NIJC \ncommits to provide ongoing training and support. At present, most law firms that handle \npro bono matters are unlikely to accept full representation of an asylum matter for the \nduration of the case. Rather, their preference is for NIJC to remain co-counsel in pro bono \nmatters and to revert the case to NIJC after a set time. To run a pro bono project, NIJC \nmust have capacity to re-absorb cases when pro bono attorneys become unavailable to \ncontinue pro bono matters. Given the length of many immigration cases, it is common for \npro bono attorneys to transition away from their firms or otherwise become unavailable to \ncontinue representing their child immigrant clients.  \n  \n9.  The confluence of rapid filing of children’s charging documents by Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) with the immigration court (which results in court hearings \nwhere children could be deported), the sudden scheduling of children’s asylum interviews \nafter years of case stagnation, and the chilling effect of anti-pro bono attorney messaging \nfrom the White House results in a dire situation for the immigrant children NIJC seeks to \nserve. Children face deportation hearings and asylum interviews that will determine their \nfutures at the very moment immigration attorneys have been unfunded and pro bono \nattorneys have been cautioned to avoid immigration matters. NIJC fears irreparable harm \nwill ensue not only to NIJC, which may be forced to reduce its Children’s Protection \nProject, including pro bono support, but to the children who desperately need NIJC’s expert \nrepresentation.     \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 404\n\n(433 of 956), Page 433 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 433 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-11     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 4\nExecuted on the 4th of April 2025, in Goshen, Indiana. \ns/ Lisa Koop                        \nLisa Koop, National Director of Legal Services  \nNational Immigrant Justice Center  \n110 E.

I certify under penalty of perjury that the following statement is true and \ncorrect pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-10) as if fully set forth hererein. \n2.  My name is Vanessa Gutierrez, and I am the Deputy Director at Northwest Immigrant \nRights Project (“NWIRP”) who oversees NWIRP’s Unaccompanied Children Program \n(“UCP”). NWIRP provides legal services to unaccompanied immigrant children and youth \nwho have been released from Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) custody to sponsors \nthroughout Washington State.  \n3.  Since learning, on March 21, 2025, of the termination of the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services (HHS) contract with Acacia for legal services for unaccompanied \nchildren (to which our organization is a subcontractor), NWIRP has had to use limited \nunrestricted funding and funds from our reserves to support our ongoing representation of \nUCP clients and retention of the 28 staff (20.9 FTEs) who provide this representation. \nMuch of our funding is grant-specific, and as an organization we rely on our limited pool \nof unrestricted funding to support work that is not covered by a specific grant but is still \nvital  for  supporting  the  rights  of  immigrant  communities  in  Washington,  including \nrepresentation of individuals detained at the Northwest ICE Processing Center, youth who \nare over the age of 18, and families seeking stability and reunification through the the \nfamily visa process. Any funds that NWIRP directs to sustain services previously provided \nunder this contract take away from other critical services that NWIRP is committed to \nproviding in the community.  \n4.  Faced with the loss of UCP funding, and to avoid needing to resort to staff layoffs in the \nfuture, NWIRP has decided to shift UCP staff to other positions with dedicated funding \nsources. This month, we plan to shift two UCP attorneys to new positions that were initially \nintended to be temporary positions for which we planned to hire externally. Now, we are \nconverting those positions into permanent positions, which will also exert a financial \nimpact on NWIRP in the long term because we will need to secure funding to support these \npositions after the funding ends. Our remaining UCP staff will need to absorb the caseloads \nof  the  two  shifting  attorneys.  We  had  already  decided  to  pause  accepting  new \nunaccompanied  children  clients  because  of  the  contract  termination,  and  now  with \nincreasing staff caseloads due to these internal shifts, future capacity to take on new \nchildren’s cases will be that much more limited. \n1 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 407\n\n(436 of 956), Page 436 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 436 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-12     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 4\n5.  The contract termination has had a significant negative impact on staff morale. Staff are \nconcerned about what the contract termination will mean for their long-term job security. \nWhile we try to reassure staff that we will do everything possible to avoid layoffs, we \ncannot guarantee that layoffs will never become necessary, especially if we lose other \nfederal funding and we are not able to raise enough funds to make up the difference. Staff \nare also aware that another organization in our area that received UCP funding and did \nsimilar work to our UCP team has had to lay off nearly all of their staff and will be closing \ntheir office in less than two months. NWIRP’s staff is also aware that there are now \nhundreds of children and youth who have lost representation in their immigration cases but \nwe are unfortunately unable to assist all of those children and youth because of NWIRP’s \nloss of the same funding. The loss of funding has also impacted our ability to hire new \nstaff. We had extended an offer to a new attorney, with extensive prior experience serving \nUCP clients, to work with our UCP team in our Granger, WA office, where it has \nhistorically been very difficult to hire. This position would have represented children in the \nUnaccompanied Refugee Minors program, which was work NWIRP had recently agreed \nto take on under our Option Year 2 contract, and it would have supported the extremely \nhigh need that we have seen for representation for unaccompanied children in this part of \nEastern Washington. The attorney was aware of the contract termination and ended up \nwithdrawing acceptance of NWIRP’s offer, in part, because of the uncertainty of funding \nin this area of work. We are unable to hire for this position now because of a hiring freeze \nwe have had to impose as a result of the lost funding, but the high need for representation \nin this area remains.  \n6.  Within the next month, NWIRP will need to attend at least one state court hearing for a \nUCP client and seven Master Calendar Hearings on the juvenile docket at the Seattle \nImmigration Court. Our UCP cases also require filing motions before the  state and \nimmigration courts and preparing applications for relief before USCIS. Any pause in this \nwork could harm our UCP clients’ cases and prospects for future immigration relief. \n \n7.  NWIRP is unable to rely only on pro bono counsel for representation. Our UCP team has \nmade efforts to recruit and train pro bono attorneys who can take on state court cases for \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile classification-eligible children and youth, but the number of \npro bono attorneys who accept referrals for our clients remains low. For cases that UCP \nstaff can place with pro bono attorneys, UCP staff end up needing to spend a significant \namount of time and resources on mentorship, technical assistance, document review, and \nassistance with client communication. The loss of the UCP funding also ended our ability \nto provide pro bono attorneys with interpretation and translation services, which is often \nan obstacle to their ability to provide representation to NWIRP clients.  \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.  \n \n2 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 408\n\n(437 of 956), Page 437 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 437 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-12     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 4\nExecuted on the 3rd of April 2025, in Wenatchee, Washington. \n \n_________________________  \nVanessa Gutierrez \nDeputy Director \nNorthwest Immigrant Rights Project  \n \n3 \n \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 409\n\n(438 of 956), Page 438 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 438 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-13     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 3\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \nCase No. 3:25-cv-2847 \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nJOEL FROST-TIFT (PUBLIC \nCOUNSEL) IN SUPPORT OF \nPlaintiffs, \nPLAINTIFFS’ MOTION FOR A \nv.

I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining\nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-9) as if fully set forth herein.\n2. My name is Joel Frost-Tift, and I am the Senior Supervising Attorney of the Unaccompa-\nnied Children’s Team at Public Counsel, a nonprofit public interest law firm in Los Ange-\nles dedicated to advancing civil rights and racial and economic justice, as well as to ampli-\nfying the power of our clients through comprehensive legal advocacy. Public Counsel is\none of the primary organizations dedicated to providing legal services to indigent unac-\ncompanied immigrant children who are released from Office of Refugee Resettlement\n(ORR) custody throughout the greater Los Angeles area.\n3. Public  Counsel’s  Immigrants’  Rights  Project  (IRP)  is  the  second-oldest  of  Public\nCounsel’s eight projects.  IRP has over 30 full-time dedicated staff members.  Within IRP,\nthe UC team is the largest subproject, with 16 staff members, 15 of whom are funded by\nUCP.    Without  UCP  funding,  we  will  be  unable  to  maintain  this  staffing  of  the\nUnaccompanied Children’s team at its current level. This loss of staff would have a\ndevastating impact on our ability to continue to represent unaccompanied children and on\nmorale within IRP and the organization as a whole.  In addition, we have been unable to\ntake on new cases since the loss of funding, which has had a detrimental effect on\nunaccompanied children in our service area.\n4. We  have  three  hearings  for  unaccompanied  children  in  the  next  month  who  need\nexperienced  attorneys  trained  in  trauma-informed  representation  to  present  their\nhumanitarian claims for relief.  These children are presenting complicated claims for\nasylum and/or Special Immigrant Juvenile Status before the courts.  Their claims touch on\nsensitive subjects such as child abuse, trafficking, and family separation.  More often than\nnot they do not speak English and have never told a soul about the abuse or mistreatment\nthey suffered before coming to the United States.  Over months — and in some cases\nyears— our attorneys have built up trust and rapport with these children in order to prepare\nfor the day they can finally present their story to a judge.\n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 411\n\n(440 of 956), Page 440 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 440 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-13     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 3\n5. Public Counsel has long collaborated with pro bono attorneys to assist in providing legal\nservices to indigent clients.  Our pro bono partners are a cornerstone of our representation\nmodel  and  allow  us  to  have  a  wider  impact  for  the  marginalized  and  underserved\ncommunities we serve.  However, pro bono counsel — no matter how experienced —\nrequires mentorship and training, which in turn requires experienced staff.  If the UCP\nfunding is not restored, we simply cannot rely on pro bono counsel to independently\nadequately represent the 200 unaccompanied children we serve annually.\nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nExecuted on the 3 of April 2025, in Los Angeles, California.  \n ______________________________  \nJoel Frost-Tift \nSenior Supervising Attorney, Unaccompanied Children’s Team \nPublic Counsel \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 412\n\n(441 of 956), Page 441 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 441 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-14     Filed 04/04/25     Page 1 of 4\n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA \nSAN FRANCISCO DIVISION \n  Case No. 3:25-cv-2847 \n \nCOMMUNITY LEGAL SERVICES IN EAST \nSUPPLEMENTAL DECLARATION OF \nPALO ALTO, et al., \nASHLEY T.

HARRINGTON \nCHILDREN’S PROGRAM MANAGING ATTORNEY \nROCKY MOUNTAIN IMMIGRANT ADVOCACY NETWORK \n  \nI, Ashley T. Harrington make the following statements on behalf of myself and the Rocky Mountain \nImmigrant  Advocacy  Network  (RMIAN).   I  certify  under penalty of perjury that  the  following \nstatement is true and correct pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1746.  \n1.  I incorporate my Declaration in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Temporary Restraining \nOrder and Preliminary Injunction (Dkt. 7-11) as if fully set forth hererein. \n2.  My name is Ashley T. Harrington, and I am the Children’s Program Managing Attorney at \nthe Rocky Mountain Immigrant Advocacy Network (“RMIAN”). RMIAN is a Colorado-\nbased nonprofit organization that provides free immigration legal and social services to \nindividuals in civil immigration detention, as well as to immigrant children and families. \nThrough its staff attorneys, paralegals, social workers, and a network of hundreds of pro \nbono attorneys, RMIAN provides legal education and free legal representation to low-\nincome immigrants who otherwise would not be able to afford an attorney.  \n3.  With  HHS  funding,  RMIAN  employs  approximately  six  full-time-equivalent  staff \nmembers  to  provide  legal  services  to  unaccompanied  children,  including:  legal \nrepresentation, pro bono recruitment, training, referrals and mentoring, coordination of \nlanguage services, program management and administrative support. Each day without this \nfunding has forced RMIAN to pull from its limited reserves in order to keep staff on and \ncontinue services for child clients.   \n4.  RMIAN has limited development staff who are already tasked with fundraising to support \nthe organization as a whole. They cannot realistically raise enough money under this \nexpedited time frame to replace the funding from HHS that RMIAN relies upon in order to \ncontinue its services. This is especially true because RMIAN is one of approximately 90 \nlegal service providers in the Acacia network who are faced with these drastic, sudden \nfunding cuts. Most will be seeking alternate funding from the same sources, forcing them \nto compete against each other for scarce resources.  \n5.  As a result of this contract termination, RMIAN is currently in an uncertain situation as it \nis reluctant to make any drastic changes in staffing or services while it awaits a final \ndecision on what funding and services may be restored.  \n6.  RMIAN’s unaccompanied child clients have immigration court hearings scheduled as soon \nas April 11 and April 16, 2025 and state court hearings as soon as April 7, 2025. In addition \nto upcoming court hearings, other clients have court-ordered deadlines to submit pleadings \n1 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 414\n\n(443 of 956), Page 443 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 443 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-14     Filed 04/04/25     Page 3 of 4\nand status updates in April and May 2025. Even for RMIAN clients who don’t have \nupcoming court hearings or deadlines, there are many urgent upcoming legal needs. For \nexample, RMIAN represents many children whose notices to appear have not yet been filed \nwith the immigration court. According to a new ICE memo reported by Reuters, ICE will \nbe prioritizing filing those charging documents to initiate removal proceedings against \nunaccompanied children. RMIAN has had notices to appear filed for unaccompanied \nchildren as recently as March 24, 2025 with a hearing set for early May 2025. It is critical \nfor an attorney to be monitoring for these notices, otherwise children run the risk of missing \ncourt hearings and being ordered removed in absentia.  \n \n7.  Without restored funding, RMIAN will be unable to offer representation to additional \nunaccompanied children. The Denver Immigration Court will be holding initial juvenile \ndockets on April 4, April 11 and on an ongoing basis. RMIAN will be unable to offer \nrepresentation to these children without continued funding, leaving these children to \nnavigate complex proceedings alone.  \n \n8.  RMIAN relies heavily on its network of pro bono attorneys to represent child clients, \nhowever pro bono attorneys cannot continue to represent clients with RMIAN’s support. \nRMIAN regularly refers unaccompanied children to pro bono counsel for representation in \npartial or full proceedings. An example of a partial referral would be that the pro bono \nattorney provides representation in the state court proceeding only, while a RMIAN \nattorney handles removal proceedings and representation in front of U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Services. In other cases, the volunteer attorney may represent the child to a \ncertain stage in their case, such as approval of Special Immigrant Juvenile Status and \ndeferred action, and then pass the child’s case back to RMIAN for ongoing representation. \nOn rare occasions, a pro bono attorney might provide full representation to a child on all \nmatters.  \n \n9.  In order for a child’s case to be successfully placed with a pro bono attorney several steps \nmust occur. RMIAN first needs to make contact with the child, either at immigration court, \nthrough our hotline or  via a referral. Then RMIAN staff must screen the child for \nimmigration relief options, which requires developing trust and rapport with the child, \nhaving  child-appropriate  and  trauma-informed  interviewing  skills,  and  having  legal \nexpertise to identify what immigration legal options a child might be eligible to pursue. \nRMIAN must also then find a competent pro bono attorney to handle the child’s legal \nmatter. This requires RMIAN staff to recruit, train and vet volunteer attorneys. The vast \nmajority of RMIAN’s volunteer attorneys do not have immigration law experience and \nwould never consider taking an immigration case without RMIAN’s referral, training, \nguidance, mentoring and malpractice  coverage. RMIAN’s attorneys provide constant \ntraining, mentoring, support and guidance to pro bono attorneys to assist them in providing \n2 \nPI Appeal and Stay Addendum 415\n\n(444 of 956), Page 444 of 95 C6ase: 25-2808, 05/05/2025, DktEntry: 5.1, Page 444 of 956\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 37-14     Filed 04/04/25     Page 4 of 4\ncompetent representation from before the time they accept a child’s case through its \nconclusion. In addition, it is unfortunately not uncommon for a volunteer attorney to agree \nto provide representation, and then fail to do so, requiring RMIAN to take the child’s case \nback to either place with another pro bono attorney or handle in-house.

Amici \n6  submit this brief to shed light on how HHS has long interpreted its congressional mandate \n7  to ensure that unaccompanied children are provided legal representation in immigration \n8  proceedings to the greatest extent practicable, by providing funding to legal service \n9  providers with critical experience and expertise in immigration law to support pro bono \n10  efforts and provide for direct representation.  Amici also write to explain why it is not \n11  feasible for Defendants to rely solely on pro bono attorneys as an alternative. \n12  Amici are invested in these issues because they have dedicated many years to efforts \n13  to assist unaccompanied children and improve the Unaccompanied Children Bureau, both \n14  inside and outside of government.  Given amici’s role in implementing these \n15  congressionally-mandated programs, and their familiarity with the realities faced by \n16  unaccompanied children and the limited availability of pro bono representation for them, \n17  amici respectfully request that this Court enjoin the actions taken by Defendants to cancel \n18  appropriated funding for the legal representation of unaccompanied children. \n19  INTRODUCTION \n20  Every year, thousands of children without lawful immigration status, including \n21  babies and toddlers, encounter the United States’ immigration system without a parent or \n22  guardian.  Many of these unaccompanied children flee their homes to escape violence and \n23  persecution, and experience exploitation or trafficking during their journey to the United \n24  States.  These children often do not speak English and are unable to understand their basic \n25  rights or the nature of the immigration proceedings without assistance.  Yet they must \n26 \n \n27 \n1 No party’s counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person other than amici \nand their counsel contributed money that was intended to fund the preparation or \n28 \nsubmission of this brief. \n[4680343.4]   1  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT.

Establishing the required elements for these legal claims is difficult and \n3  complex even for an unrepresented adult, let alone a child.  Without a lawyer, \n4  unaccompanied children are unlikely to be able to fairly present their case for immigration \n5  relief, and risk being returned to the very trafficking, persecution, or abuse and neglect that \n6  they fled. \n7  To meet unaccompanied children’s acute need for legal representation in the \n8  immigration system, Congress enacted, as part of the William Wilberforce Trafficking \n9  Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 (“TVPRA”), the requirement that HHS \n10  “ensure, to the greatest extent practicable …, that all unaccompanied alien children … \n11  have counsel to represent them in legal proceedings or matters and protect them from \n12  mistreatment, exploitation, and trafficking.”  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5) (emphasis added).  In \n13  2024, HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement (“ORR”) issued a Foundational Rule \n14  requiring ORR to “fund legal service providers to provide direct immigration legal \n15  representation for certain unaccompanied children,” to the extent that “appropriations are \n16  available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro bono counsel ….”  45 \n17  C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4). \n18  Defendants’ sudden termination of funding for direct legal representation for \n19  unaccompanied children will significantly increase the number of children who are forced \n20  to navigate the immigration system without an attorney, reducing their stability, increasing \n21  their vulnerability to human trafficking and exploitation, and subjecting them to the very \n22  real likelihood of unjust removal from the United States.  While Defendants say pro bono \n23  representation is a “viable alternative[]” to direct legal representation funding, ECF No. 24 \n24  at 12,2 the reality is that ORR has been unable to ensure legal representation for more than \n25  40% of unaccompanied children in immigration proceedings even through its longstanding \n26  approach of both promoting access to pro bono counsel and funding direct legal \n27 \n \n28 \n2 Citations to filings in this matter are to ECF pagination. \n[4680343.4]   2  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT.

It will be impossible to secure pro bono representation for the majority of \n2  the 26,000 unaccompanied children currently receiving direct legal representation funded \n3  by ORR.  Due to the limited availability of volunteer attorneys, unaccompanied children \n4  encounter backlogs and waitlists when trying to obtain pro bono representation.  A study \n5  by Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse Immigration \n6  Project found that, as of the end of April 2023, only 0.8% of those ordered removed from \n7  the United States in immigration court could find a volunteer lawyer to represent them.  \n8  TRANSACTIONAL RECORDS ACCESS CLEARINGHOUSE (“TRAC”), DESPITE EFFORTS TO \n9  PROVIDE PRO BONO REPRESENTATION, GROWTH IS FAILING TO MEET EXPLODING \n10  DEMANDS (May 12, 2023), https://tracreports.org/reports/716/.  And pro bono attorneys \n11  who do not otherwise practice immigration law will often need training and support to \n12  provide adequate representation. \n13  The Trump Administration is now targeting unaccompanied children for \n14  immigration enforcement, making legal representation in children’s immigration cases \n15  even more critical.  Marisa Taylor, Ted Hesson & Kristina Cooke, Trump Officials Launch \n16  ICE Effort to Deport Unaccompanied Migrant Children, REUTERS (Feb. 23, 2025 at \n17  5:00am PST), https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-directs-ice-agents-\n18  find-deport-unaccompanied-migrant-2025-02-23/.  The consequences of mistakenly or \n19  wrongfully deporting someone are grave.  They are heightened for children, given their \n20  many vulnerabilities, especially children who are without a parent or legal guardian to help \n21  and protect them.  Amici thus respectfully request that the Court enjoin the actions taken by \n22  Defendants to abruptly cancel appropriated funding for the legal representation of \n23  unaccompanied children. \n24  ARGUMENT \n25  I.  UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN SUFFER HARM WHEN THEY MUST \nNAVIGATE THE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WITHOUT A LAWYER  \n26   \n27  Legal representation in immigration proceedings is critical to support the well-being \n28  and stability of unaccompanied children.  This includes helping children understand what \n[4680343.4]   3  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT. OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS. ISO \nPLFS’ MOT. FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 78     Filed 04/23/25     Page 5 of 14\n \n1  options, if any, they may have to remain in the United States.  Without a lawyer, \n2  unaccompanied children will often be unable to achieve a basic understanding of their \n3  rights, let alone make a case for asylum or other immigration relief.  This can increase a \n4  child’s anxiety and make them feel alone in a very complex legal system that has major \n5  life-altering consequences. \n6  If a child is eligible for immigration relief that can assist them in remaining in the \n7  United States, it is essential for the child’s well-being that this is pursued.  Collectively, \n8  amici are familiar with many cases of children who were referred by ORR to be provided \n9  legal representation due to their vulnerabilities and potential eligibility for immigration \n10  relief, including children who have been victimized by crime and human trafficking, who \n11  are victims of abuse and neglect, and who are potentially eligible for asylum due to an \n12  individualized fear of persecution. \n13  Although “ORR strives for 100% legal representation of unaccompanied children,” \n14  Unaccompanied Children Program Foundational Rule, 88 Fed. Reg. 68948 (Oct. 4, 2023), \n15  nearly half still appear in immigration court without a lawyer.  Executive Office for \n16  Immigration Review Adjudication Statistics: Current Representation Rates, U.S. DEP’T OF \n17  JUSTICE (Oct. 12, 2023), https://www.justice.gov/eoir/page/file/1062991/dl?inline= (in \n18  2023, only 56% of unaccompanied children with pending immigration cases had an \n19  attorney).  The differences in outcomes for children without legal representation is stark.  \n20  From 2005 through 2017, 7.2% of children with legal representation received asylum, \n21  special immigrant juvenile status for abused, neglected, or abandoned children, or some \n22  other form of immigration relief, compared to only 0.3% without an attorney.  \n23  CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE, R43599, UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN: AN \n24  OVERVIEW (2024) at 39-40 & Table 2, https://sgp.fas.org/crs/homesec/R43599.pdf.  By \n25  contrast, 84% of unaccompanied children without lawyers received removal orders from \n26  immigration courts, compared to only 21% of represented children.  Id.  Without legal \n27  representation, unaccompanied children are far less likely to be able to adequately present \n28  a case for immigration relief to which they may be entitled, and are more likely to be \n[4680343.4]   4  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT. OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS. ISO \nPLFS’ MOT. FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 78     Filed 04/23/25     Page 6 of 14\n \n1  deported back into potentially dangerous circumstances in their home countries, at great \n2  risk to their personal safety. \n3  Children’s stability in the United States is also impacted by whether or not they \n4  have legal representation.  First, children’s access to legal representation supports their \n5  legal case, which may provide them with permanency and stability in the United States.  \n6  Expanding and increasing legal representation gives children the chance to receive legal \n7  status for which they are eligible, and, subsequently, the services that will provide them \n8  with stability and well-being.  Legal counsel also supports vulnerable children by \n9  connecting them with other services in the community.  In 2021, the Migration Policy \n10  Institute issued a report highlighting the importance of the services provided to \n11  unaccompanied children after they are released from ORR custody, including legal \n12  services.  MARK GREENBERG, KYLIE GROW, STEPHANIE HEREDIA, KIRA MONIN & ESSEY \n13  WORKIE, STRENGTHENING SERVICES FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN U.S. \n14  COMMUNITIES, MIGRATION POLICY INSTITUTE (2021), https://www.migrationpolicy.org/\n15  sites/default/files/publications/mpi-unaccompanied-children-services_final.pdf.  One of the \n16  report’s findings was that legal services are “particularly crucial for children in light of \n17  their unique vulnerabilities,” and that in addition to providing legal support, legal service \n18  providers “often connect children with services such as school enrollment, health care, \n19  mental-health services, food, and housing.”  Id. at 2.  Attorneys also serve a unique \n20  function due to the attorney-client privilege, as the lawyer may be the only person to whom \n21  the child can safely reveal that they are being exploited, trafficked, or abused.  Id. at 23. \n22  Without these services, it has been amici’s experience that unaccompanied \n23  children’s risk of exploitation increases.  For many unaccompanied children, their lack of \n24  immigration status makes them more vulnerable to unscrupulous employers seeking to \n25  exploit them with dangerous and underpaid work.  Traffickers similarly seek out \n26  vulnerable children.  Not only does legal representation increase children’s ability to gain \n27  legal status and gainful employment, thus removing a vulnerability to exploitation, legal \n28  counsel can also help children understand their rights (including labor rights), and support \n[4680343.4]   5  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT.

ORR HAS CONSISTENTLY RECOGNIZED ITS CONGRESSIONALLY-\nMANDATED OBLIGATION TO ENSURE THE PROVISION OF LEGAL \n4  REPRESENTATION FOR UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN TO THE \nGREATEST EXTENT PRACTICABLE \n5   \n6  ORR has consistently interpreted the TVPRA to mandate that it “ensure” the \n7  provision of legal services to unaccompanied children “to the greatest extent practicable,” \n8  and that this necessarily means that ORR should provide funding for direct legal services \n9  when appropriated funds are available to do so, and when pro bono provision of legal \n10  services is not sufficient to meet the need.  8 U.S.C. § 1232(c)(5).  Indeed, in 2024 the \n11  ORR issued a Foundational Rule requiring itself to “fund legal service providers to provide \n12  direct immigration legal representation for certain unaccompanied children,” to the extent \n13  that “appropriations are available, and insofar as it is not practicable for ORR to secure pro \n14  bono counsel ….”  45 C.F.R. § 410.1309(a)(4).  As discussed further below, the \n15  availability of pro bono counsel has never been sufficient to meet the need for legal \n16  representation, and as such, ORR has also provided funding for direct legal representation \n17  for unaccompanied children appropriated by Congress for that purpose through a legal \n18  services contract. \n19  Congress regularly appropriates funding for direct legal representation, and directs \n20  ORR to spend additional funds for legal services for unaccompanied children.  \n21  Congressional appropriators have consistently and repeatedly expressed interest and \n22  support for legal services for children, including on regular calls with one of the amici \n23  prior to their departure from ORR, and have enacted report language directing ORR to use \n24  appropriated funding “for the significant expansion of direct representation for children … \n25  consistent with the goals of the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act of \n26  2008 for all children to have access to counsel.”  Explanatory Statement for Departments \n27  of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies \n28  Appropriations Bill, 2023: Summary of Budget Estimates and Committee \n[4680343.4]   6  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT.

FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 78     Filed 04/23/25     Page 8 of 14\n \n1  Recommendations, U.S. SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, at 194, \n2  https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/LHHSFY23REPT.pdf. \n3  III.  PRO BONO LEGAL SERVICES ARE NOT A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO \nREPLACE THE DIRECT LEGAL REPRESENTATION FUNDED BY ORR  \n4   \n5  Based on amici’s collective experience, it is not feasible for Defendants to rely on \n6  pro bono legal services to replace the federally funded direct legal representation for \n7  unaccompanied children.  ORR has been unable to ensure legal representation for a large \n8  percentage of unaccompanied children even through its longstanding approach of both \n9  promoting access to pro bono counsel and funding direct legal representation.  Indeed, \n10  ORR relies on its legal services contract for promotion of and support for pro bono \n11  representation.  There are no ORR staff whose responsibilities are to promote or support \n12  pro bono legal services for unaccompanied children.  It is unclear what other mechanism \n13  (if any) ORR has to facilitate access to pro bono representation if the cancellation of the \n14  legal services funding is not enjoined. \n15  Due to the limited availability of volunteer attorneys, many unaccompanied \n16  children encounter backlogs and waitlists when trying to obtain pro bono representation. \n17  GREENBERG, ET AL., supra, at 24, https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/\n18  publications/mpi-unaccompanied-children-services_final.pdf.  As discussed above, less \n19  than 1% of persons who were ordered removed in immigration court were able to find a \n20  volunteer lawyer to represent them.  TRAC, supra, https://tracreports.org/reports/716/. \n21  Compounding the existing shortage of pro bono representation, amici are concerned \n22  that the Trump Administration’s recent Presidential Memorandum targeting and \n23  threatening immigration lawyers based on unsupported accusations of misconduct is likely \n24  to discourage some attorneys from practicing immigration law, and will thus make pro \n25  bono representation availability even more scarce.  See Presidential Memorandum for the \n26  Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security: Preventing Abuses of the Legal \n27  System and the Federal Court, THE WHITE HOUSE (Mar. 22, 2025), https://www.\n28  whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-\n[4680343.4]   7  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT. OF HEALTH & HUMAN SERVS. ISO \nPLFS’ MOT. FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-02847-AMO     Document 78     Filed 04/23/25     Page 9 of 14\n \n1  the-federal-court/ (falsely accusing “the immigration bar, and powerful Big Law pro bono \n2  practices” of “frequently coach[ing] clients to conceal their past or lie about their \n3  circumstances when asserting their asylum claims … in an attempt to … deceive the \n4  immigration authorities and courts into granting them undeserved relief”).   \n5  Other actions by the Trump Administration—including executive orders imposing \n6  sanctions on certain law firms that engage in pro bono work in opposition to the federal \n7  government, and agreements reached with other large law firms to provide hundreds of \n8  millions of dollars in pro bono legal services for causes supported by the President—are \n9  likely to have the dual effect of taking limited pro bono resources away from causes not \n10  supported by the Trump Administration (such as the representation of unaccompanied \n11  children in immigration court), and discouraging large law firms from engaging in any pro \n12  bono work in opposition to the federal government, for fear of reprisal. \n13  Another limitation on the availability of adequate pro bono representation is the \n14  complexity of immigration law.  Immigration law is a specialized field, and some cases \n15  require expertise—for instance, on human trafficking, state child welfare systems, and \n16  highly specialized immigration visas—which not all immigration attorneys have, much \n17  less volunteer lawyers without significant immigration experience:  As explained in the \n18  2021 Migration Policy Institute report, “[w]hile pro bono attorneys play a crucial role in \n19  expanding available representation, they may not be trained or have experience in \n20  immigration law, nor in trauma-informed or culturally responsible service delivery.”  \n21  GREENBERG, ET AL., supra, at 24, https://www.migrationpolicy.org/sites/default/files/\n22  publications/mpi-unaccompanied-children-services_final.pdf.   \n23  Finding pro bono legal representation is also particularly difficult in some parts of \n24  the United States, including rural areas where many children are discharged from ORR \n25  custody.  These areas are sometimes referred to as “legal deserts,” in that there is little to \n26  no access to immigration attorneys.  Recognizing this limitation, ORR provided funds to  \n27  provide direct legal representation for unaccompanied children in these areas.  If \n28  Defendants’ cancellation of this funding is not enjoined, it is unclear how ORR would be \n[4680343.4]   8  Case No. 25-cv-2847-AMO \n \nAMICUS CURIAE BRIEF OF FORMER OFFICIALS OF U.S. DEPT.

A nationwide network \n5  of attorneys is essential to ensure continuity in a child’s legal representation, and to \n6  prevent representation from ending because their lawyer can only practice in certain \n7  jurisdictions.  ORR transfers children between facilities and discharges them to sponsors in \n8  hundreds of counties in all fifty states, and attorneys have no say in that process.  Many \n9  volunteer attorneys may not or cannot provide representation when they know that a \n10  child’s jurisdiction will likely change during the course of their case.  This makes it all the \n11  more difficult to recruit pro bono attorneys for the cases of unaccompanied children. \n12  ORR currently relies on legal service providers that receive federal funding to \n13  promote and support pro bono representation of unaccompanied children, including by \n14  providing mentoring and guidance for volunteer attorneys.  The nationwide network of \n15  immigration legal professionals who receive funding from ORR can recruit pro bono \n16  attorneys in needed geographical areas and with particular expertise, as well as provide \n17  training and support for such attorneys.  Such a structure is in the best interest of children, \n18  as well as the government, to ensure that ORR fulfills its mandate to provide access to \n19  legal services.  It does not appear that ORR has any viable alternative means to provide \n20  access to pro bono representation for unaccompanied children, let alone to expand pro \n21  bono legal services in the wake of the sudden cancellation of the legal services funding.  \n22  Pro bono legal services is not a feasible alternative to funding direct legal representation. \n23  CONCLUSION \n24  For the foregoing reasons, amici respectfully request that this Court enjoin the \n25  actions taken by Defendants to abruptly cancel appropriated funding for the legal \n26  representation of unaccompanied children without a plan to ensure that these services can \n27  continue at the rate and quality with which they have been functioning.
