    "summary": "<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Background</span></p>\r\n<p>Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Amendments Act of 2008, 50 U.S.C. &sect; 1881a, permits the Attorney General (AG) and the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to conduct foreign intelligence surveillance targeting the communications of non-U.S. persons located abroad. The government need not establish probable cause that the target of electronic surveillance is a foreign power or agent of a foreign power, nor must the government specify the nature and location of the facilities or places that surveillance will occur. Communications of U.S. citizens and residents are frequently collected \"incidentally\" if those U.S. persons are communicating with or about a targeted foreigner.</p>\r\n<p>Section 702 requires that the AG, through the Department of Justice (DOJ), and DNI, through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), submit annual &ldquo;certifications&rdquo; that define the categories of foreign actors that may be appropriately targeted. By law, these certifications must include specific targeting and minimization procedures adopted by the AG in consultation with the DNI. These certifications must be approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before Section 702 surveillance may be conducted. For a more in-depth overview of the certification process, see <a href=\"../../../../case/14411/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re DNI/AG 702(i) Certification 2008</a>. For the previous year&rsquo;s certification, see <a href=\"../../../../case/45194/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In re DNI/AG 702(h) Certification 2023-A and Its Predecessor Certifications [FISC Docket 702(j)-23-01; 702(j)-23-02; 702(j)-23-03]</a>.</p>\r\n<p>This entry summarizes the 2024 certification, which was assigned to Judge Anthony J. Trenga of the FISC. The government submitted its request for certifications on March 5, 2024, and the court approved the request on April 4, 2024.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Review of Written Procedures</span></p>\r\n<p>First, the Court reviewed the targeting procedures to determine whether they were they were reasonably designed to ensure that acquired data was limited to persons &ldquo;reasonably believed to be located outside the US.&rdquo; The Court reviewed both NSA and FBI targeting procedures, and determined that both sets of procedures were identical to ones proposed and approved in the 2023 Certification, and were therefore consistent with statutory requirements under FISA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Second, the Court considered minimization procedures, which aim to minimize the acquisition, retention, and subsequent dissemination of nonpublic information without consent, and within certain guidelines. These definitions apply to electronic surveillance and physical search, and focus on protecting US persons&rsquo; data, as Section 702 information may only target persons reasonably believed to be non-US persons located outside the US. The Court noted, however, that the large number of Section 702 facilities &ldquo;suggests that, despite &hellip; limits on acquisition, large amounts of private U.S.-person information are likely to be acquired under Section 702.&rdquo; The Court reviewed the minimization procedures of the four agencies (FBI, NSA, CIA, and National Counterterrorism Center), and determined that they were identical to the ones submitted and approved by the Court in 2023, and therefore satisfied the definition of minimization procedures.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the Court reviewed the querying procedures, which aim to limit queries of unminimized data to those that are &ldquo;reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information,&rdquo; or, for the FBI, &ldquo;evidence of a crime.&rdquo; The FBI&rsquo;s 2024 querying procedures modified previous 2023 querying procedures by requiring users to enter a &ldquo;written statement of the specific factual basis to believe that the query is reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime&rdquo; before querying. While the provision is more stringent than the previous provision (which only required the statement to review or access information after the querying), the Court noted that, since the FBI already required users to enter the statement pre-query in late 2023, the modified procedure effectively codified existing practice. The FBI had also modified 2024 querying procedures to require prior approval for three categories of queries with heightened privacy concerns. In particular, the new procedures require approval from an FBI attorney before conducting any batch queries (i.e. compilations of multiple queries at the same time in one \"batch\"). At the same time, the batch querying tool was reconfigured to require users to indicate compliance with the policy before running a batch query. The Court noted that both policies were likely to improve compliance with the querying standard and enhance privacy protection for US persons.</p>\r\n<p>The Court concluded that the 2024 targeting, minimization, and querying procedures of the submitted certifications were identical to, or improved upon, earlier procedures. The Court held that they were therefore consistent with FISA's requirements and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\r\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Review of Implementation and Compliance</span></p>\r\n<p>Next, the Court reviewed the agencies&rsquo; implementation and compliance with the written procedures. First, the Court indicated that the CIA had developed \"a new capability\" meant \"to help CIA personnel review large volumes of information efficiently.\" The details were redacted, but the Court held that this new capability did not qualify as a \"query\" under FISA, and met statutory and constitutional requirements.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of compliance, the Court noted that certain contexts appear repeatedly in noncompliant queries across field offices, including support of domestic terrorism assessments, criminal investigations without a foreign nexus, and vetting of human sources. It also noted that, while the government has not reported the same level of large-scale, suspicion-less queries which contributed to a finding of deficiency in 2018, there were reports of some FBI personnel repeatedly misapplying the querying standard. The Court noted that the FBI should continue to prioritize proper application of the standard with training and oversight.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately the Court approved the certification with certain reporting requirements. This case is now closed, and the next certification will occur in 2025.</p>",

These \nquerying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minimization \nprocedmes, and nothing in these procedures pennits any actions that would otherwise be \nprohibited by those minimization procedures.

NCTC will make a record of the action taken, to include any \nquery tenn(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director ofNational \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC'') of such activity._ \n. \n~ \nIll (U) Definitions and Presumptions  J  •  , \n. , \nA.  (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n.• I \n..' .  \n(U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in SO U.S.C. § 1801 for thftettns - ,  ·.; \n\"foreign intelligence information,\" ''person,\" ''United States,\" and ''United Stat~s person.~ \n(S//NF) When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query temt\" means a· te®thaf \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons.  United States \nperson query tenns may be either a single item of information or infonnation that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons.  Detennining whether infonnation is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particuJar context may require a case-by-case assessment \nby a trained intelligence professional. \"United States person query term\" is not limited to \nany single category of information or technology.  Depending on the context, examples of \nSECRET//NOFORN \nClassified by:  The Attorney General \nDerived From:  DOJ/NSI SCG 1 INT dated 20120701, 1.6 \nI  FILEDUNDERSEAL I  Declassify On: 20451013 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nUnited States person query terms may include: names or unique titles; government \nassociated personal or corporate identification numbers;   \n and street address, telephone, and   \nUnited States person query term does not include a reference to a product by brand or \nmanufacturer's name (o  r related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n(e .g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 321 \"). \n(U)  \"Query\" means the use of one or more terms 1 to retrieve the unminimized contents or \nnoncontents of section 702-acquired information that is located in an NCTC system.  The \nterm \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains unminimized section \n702-acquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation in response to the query either because the user has not been granted access to \nthe unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user who has been granted \nsuch access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve unminimized section 702-\nacquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a system user's actions \nsubsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of that query based upon \nthe attributes of the information retrieved, 2 or (2) examining or manipulating, including by \ntechnical means, communications or documents for the purpose of minimizing such \ncommunications or documents. 3 \n(U)  \"NCTC personnel\" means (i) individuals directly employed by NCTC, (ii) individuals \ndetailed to NCTC from other departments or agencies who work under NCTC management \nand supervision in a manner substantially the same as individuals directly employed by \nNCTC, and (iii) contractors working under NCTC management and supervision who are \nauthorized to perfonn services in support ofNCTC on FISA-related matters. \nB.  (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \nI.  (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \n1 (S//NF) Such terms may include the use of keywords, identifiers,  \n \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person I.\" \nSECRET//NOFORN \n2 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \npermanent residence, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n3.  (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the office of \nNCTC Legal Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \noffice of NCTC Legal Counsel and NSD. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV.  (U) Querying Procedures \nA.  (U)  Query Standard.  Each query of NCTC systems containing unminimized content or \nnoncontent information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably \nlikely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, unless otherwise \nspecifically excepted in these procedures. \nB.  (U) Creation and Maintenance of Query Records \n1.  (U)  NCTC must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702.  Such electronic record must, at a minimum, include the following \ninformation: \na.  (U) the query term( s) used; \nb.  (U)  the date of the query; and \nc.  (U)  the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n2.  (U)  Any use of a United States person query term also must be accompanied by a \nstatement of facts showing that the use of that query term is reasonably likely to \nSECRET//NOFORN \n3 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nretrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA.  NCTC shall maintain a \nrecord of each such statement of facts. \n3.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for an NCTC system to generate an electronic \nrecord, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents the \ngeneration of such an electronic record, NCTC must generate and maintain a written \nrecord of each United States person query term that contains the same information \nrequired for electronic records, as described above.  Before conducting a query in a \nsystem that does not generate an electronic record of a query, NCTC personnel must \nreasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that generates an \nelectronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or \nsecurity reasons. \n4.

(U) These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized infonnation, acquired pursuant \nto section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (4'FISA\" or \"the \nAct\"), by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (\"FBr)), and apply in addition to separate \nminimization procedures for the FBI adopted pursuant to subsection 702(e ) of the Act.  These \nquerying procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those minimization \nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be \nprohibited by those minimization procedures.  FBI personnel who have completed training in \nthese procedures and the FBI's section 702 minimization procedures may query FBI systems \ncontaining unminimized infonnation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act to find, extract, \nreview, translate, and assess whether such information reasonably appears to be foreign \nintelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence infonnation or assess \nits importance, or to be evidence of a crime.  Authorized users with access to unminimized \nsection 702-acquired infonnation should process the results of an appropriate query of \nunminimized section 702-acquired infonnation in accordance with the FBI's applicable section \n702 minimization procedures. \nII. (U)  If the FBI determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life ( e.g., force protection or hostage \nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, the FBI \nmay take such action immediately.  The FBI will make a record ~f the action taken) to include \nany query term(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"'ODNI\") and to the Department of Justices National Security Division (\"NSD')), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nlll. (U)  Definitions and Presumptions \nA.  (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U .S.C. § 1801 for the tenns \n\"foreign intelligence information,\" \"person/' \"United States,\" and \"United States person.\" \n@Q;i;l If)  When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons.  United States \nperson query tenns may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons.  Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment \nClassififoJ h;.

Depending on the context, examples of \nUnited States person query terms may include: names or unique titles; government \n~ersonal or corporate identification numbers; \n- -and street address, telephone, and \nUnited States person query term does not include a reference to a product by brand or \nmanufacturer's name (o  r related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n( e.g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 32 l \"). \n(U)  \"Query\" means the usc of one or more terms I to retrieve the unminimized contents or \nnoncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located in an \nFBI system.  The tenn \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains \nunminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized \nsection 702-acquired information in response to the query either because the user has not \nbeen granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user \nwho has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve \nunminimized section 702-acquired information.  The term \"query\" also does not include (1) a \nsystem user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of \nthat query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved,2 (2) examining or \nmanipulating, including by technical means, communications or documents for the purpose \nof minimizing such communications or documents,3 (3) searches done for UAM purposes in \nsystems or other repositories that contain UAM data, as defined in Section 111.F.7 of the \nFBI's section 702 minimization procedures, so long as the only unminimized section 702-\nacquired information that the searches run against are in records captured through user \nactivity monitoring, or ( 4) searches conducted in the special purpose systems defined in \nSections Ill.F.5 and 6 of the FBI's section 702 minimization procedures in furtherance of an \nauthorized use specified in those provisions. \n(U)  \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a \ncommunication. \n(U)  \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated \nwith a communication, but does not include information concerning the substance, purport, \nor meaning of the communication. \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 (U) For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person I.\" \nfJ 13 6ft 13'.fi/Jlftl 0120 ll.lf \n2 \n\n(U)  The terms \"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" and \"FBI personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of the FBI, as well as all contractors and others authorized to work under the \ndirection and control of the FBI. \nB. (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U) The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n1.  (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n3.  (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the FBI Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nFBI Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV. (U)  Querying Procedures \nA.  (U)  Query Standard \n(U)  Each query of FBI systems containing unminimized contents or noncontents (including \nmetadata) acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, or evidence of a crime, unless \notherwise specifically excepted in these procedures.  In order to meet this standard: \n1.   (U)  the person conducting the query must have the purpose of retrieving foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime; \n3 \n\n2.  (U)  the person conducting the query must have a specific factual basis to believe that \nit is reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence of a \ncrime; and \n3.  (U) the query must be reasonably tailored to retrieve foreign intelligence information \nor evidence of a crime without unnecessarily retrieving other information. \nB.  (U) Written Justification \n(U)  Prior to querying section 702-acquired information using a United States person query \nterm, FBI personnel will provide a written statement of the specific factual basis to believe \nthat the query is reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information or evidence of \na crime.  Such written statement will comply with the documentation requirements set forth \nin Section IV.E.4 below. \nC.  (U) Evidence of a Crime Queries \n(U)  For queries conducted using United States person query terms that are not designed to \nfind and extract foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, the FBI will follow the \nprocedures in subsection 702(f)(2) of FISA before accessing the unminimized contents of \ncommunications retrieved by such queries in connection with a predicated criminal \ninvestigation that does not relate to the national security of the United States, unless there is a \nreasonable belief that such contents could assist in mit i gating or eliminating a threat to life or \nserious bodily harm.  Consistent with subsections 702(f)(2)(F)(ii)-(iii) of the Act, this \nrestriction does not prohibit or limit (1) the FBI's ability to review, without a court order, the \nresults of any query of section 702-acquired information that was reasonably designed to find \nand extract foreign intelligence information, regardless of whether such foreign intelligence \ninformation could also be considered evidence of a crime; and (2) the FBI's ability to access \nthe results of queries that were conducted when evaluating whether to open an assessment or \npredicated investigation related to the national security of the United States. \nD. (U)  Pre-Approval Requirements \n(U) Except in cases in which FBI has a reasonable belief that queries could assist in \nresponding to or preventing an immediate threat to life or serious bodily harm or an \nimminent cyber or infrastructure attack, the following approvals are required prior to running \na query: \n1.  (U)  Approval from a position no lower than the FBI Deputy Director (or successor \nposition) for any query term reasonably believed to identify a U.S. elected official, \nappointee of either the President or a state or territorial Governor, U.S. political \ncandidate, U.S. political organization or individual prominent in such organization, or \nU.S. news media organization or member of the U.S. news media; \n4 \n\n-''.l!Cft'.lt I JJf 4'0P Oftl◄ \n2.  (U)  FBI attorney approval for any query terms reasonably believed to identify a U.S. \nreligious organization or individual promine11t in such organization, and individuals, \norganizations, or groups reasonably believed to have a U.S. academic nexus; and \n3.  (U)  FBI attorney approval for all queries using the FBI's batch query technology or \nsuccessor tool. \nE.  (U)  Creation and Maintenance of Query Records \nI.  (U) The FBI must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized content or noncontent \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702.  Such electronic record must, at a \nminimum, include the following information: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used; \nb.  (U)  the date of the query; and \nc.  (U)  the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n2.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for an FBI system to generate an electronic record \nof each United States person query term, or in the event an unanticipated \ncircumstance arises that prevents the generation of such an electronic record, the FBI \nmust generate and maintain a written record of each United States person query term \nthat contains the same information required for electronic records, as described \nabove.  Before conducting a query in a system that does not generate an electronic \nrecord of a query, FBJ personnel must reasonably determine that conducting that \nquery in a system that generates an electronic record would be insufficient for \ntechnical, analytical, operational, or security reasons. \n3.  (U)  The FBI will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner \nthat will allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner.  Such records (both electronic and written) must be maintained at least five \nyears from the date the United States person query term was used.  NSD and ODNJ \nwill review the FBl's queries of unminimized section 702-acquired information using \nany such query terms to ensure that they were reasonably likely to retrieve foreign \nintelligence information or evidence of a crime, or were otherwise conducted \npursuant to one of the exceptions provided below. \n4.  (U)  The FBI shall maintain a record of each statement of facts required by Section \nTV.B above in a manner that will enable oversight by NSD and ODNI. \nF.  (U)  Exceptions \n(U)  Notwithstanding subsection IV.A above, nothing in these procedures shall prohibit \nthe lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the applicable Offices of the \nInspectors General, or restrict the FBI from providing the assistance necessary for these \n813 Oft@if;f;lf f Of i Ol lf f \n5 \n\n813CRl3'F;';lf'v8F8Rn \nentities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and nothing in these procedures shall \nprohibit the FBI from conducting queries it determines are necessary to: \n1.  (U)  the FBI' s performance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of FISA and the FBI's FISA procedures, including its section \n702 procedures.  However, the FBI shall use non-United States person query terms to \nperform such queries, unless the FBI determines that there is a particular need to use a \nUnited States person query term in such a query to conduct training on the \nimplementation of an aspect of the FBI' s section 702 procedures; \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of FBI systems that process or \nstore unminimized section 702-acquired information; \n3.  (U) comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight; \n4.  (U)  comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; \n5.  (U)  conduct vulnerability or network assessments using unminimized information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not \nor have not been compromised; \n6.  (U)  identify information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter; or \n7.  (U)  perform the following lawful oversight functions of FBI's personnel or systems: \na.  (U)  support the FBl's investigation and remediation of a possible FISA \ncompliance incident; \nb.  (U)  remediate a potential spill of classified FISA-acquired information in FBI \nsystems; \nc.  (U)  identify FISA-acquired information subject to destruction, including \nunder the FBl's section 702 minimization procedures; \nd.  (U) ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin the FBI's FISA minimization procedures; \ne.  (U)  assess compliance with federal record-keeping requirements, where such \nqueries are conducted in audit and oversight systems, as defined in FBI's \nsection 702 minimization procedures, that contain FBI personnel e-mails and \ninstant messages that may contain unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation; or \nf.  (U)  support the FBl's audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work \ndone related to FISA collection by FBI personnel. \n6 \n\nS~Cftlff//NOPORN \n(U) Should the FBI detennine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart from those \nspecified in this subsection (IV.F), the FBI shall consult \\\\itb NSD and ODNI prior to \nconducting such a query.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation to the FISC.  Each such \nreport shall describe the nature of the deviation from the procedures and identify the specific \noversight activity for which the deviation was necessary. \n(U) Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsection IV .E above, the FBI must keep a \nrecord of any United States person query term used for a query of wuninirniz.ed section 702, \nacquired information in support of the activities described in this subsection (IV .F). \nAssistant Attorney General for Na!ional Security \nM!:t!MJ lJIHOPORU \n7 ",

The tenn \n\"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that contains unminimized section 702-\nacquired information, where the user does not receive unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation in response to the query either because the user has not been granted access to \nthe unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user who has been granted \nsuch access has limited the query such that it cannoi retrieve unminimized section 702-\nacquired information.  The tenn \"query\" also does not include (1) a system user's actions \nsubsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of that query based upon \nthe attributes of the information retrieved,2 (2) examining or manipulating, including by \ntechnical means, communications or documents for the purpose of minimizing such \ncommunications or documents,3 or (3) searches conducted in user activity monitoring \nsystems, as described in CIA' s section 702 minimiz.ation procedures, so long as the only \nunminimized section 702-acquired infonnation that the searches run against are in recorqs \ncaptured through user activity monitoring. \n(U)  The terms \"Central Intelligence Agency,\" \"CIA,\" and \"CIA personnel\" refer to any \nemployees of CIA and any other personnel acting under the direction, authority, or control of \nthe Director of the CIA, as well as to employees of other U.S. Government agencies who are \nphysically located at CIA and who are granted access to CIA systems to perfonn duties in \nsupport of CIA operations, but who retain the authorities and responsibilities of their parent \norganization. \nB. (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n1 (S//NF) Such tenns may include the use of keywords, identifiers,  \n \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the infonnation actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic tenn, such as \"U.S. Person 1.\" \nSECRET//NOFORN \n2 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n·(I) (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence, or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n(2) (U) A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person Wlless the person is identified \nas a United States person or the circwnstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n(3) (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, Wlless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the CIA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Fonn 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \noffice of CIA Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n( 4) (U) An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nIV. (U)  Querying Procedures \nA.  (U) Query Standard.  Each query of CIA systems containing unminimized content or \nnoncontent infonnation acquired pursuant to section 702 of FISA must be reasonably \nlikely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, unless otherwise \nspecifically excepted in these procedures. \nB.  (U) Creation and Maintenance of Query Records. \n1.  (U)  CIA must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702.  Such electronic record must, at a minim~ include the following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used; \nb.  (U) the date of the query; and \nc.  (U)  the identifier of the user who conducted the query. \n2. • (U) Any use of a United States person query term also must be accompanied by a \nstatement of facts showing that the use of that query term is reasonably likely to \nSECRET//NOFORN \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nretrieve foreign intelligence infonnation, as defined by FISA.  CIA shall maintain a \nrecord of each such statement of facts. \n3.  (U)  In the event it is impracticabie for a CIA system to generate an electronic record, \nor· in the event an unanticipated circwnstance arises that prevents the generation of \nsuch an electronic record, CIA must generate and maintain a written record of each \nUnited States person query term that contains the same information required for \nelectronic records, as described above.  Before conducting a query in a system that \ndoes not generate an electronic record of a query, CIA personnel must reasonably \ndetermine that conducting that query in a system that generates an electronic record \nwould be insufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or security reasons. \n4.  (U)  CIA will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner that \nwill allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner.  Such records (both electronic and written), to include the statements of facts, \nmust be maintained at least five years from the date the United States person query \nterm was used.  NSD and ODNI will review CIA's queries of unminimized section \n702-acquired information using any such query tenns to ensure that they. were \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, or were otherwise \nconducted pursuant to one of the exceptions provided below. \nC.  (U)  Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsections IV.A and lV.B.2 above, nothing in these \nprocedures shall prohibit the lawful oversight functions of NSD or ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict CIA from providing the \nassistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and \nnothing in these procedures shall prohibit CIA from conducting queries it determines are \nnecessary to: \nI .  (U)  CIA' s perfonnance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of section 702 and CIA's section 702 procedures. However, \nCIA shall use non-United States person identifiers to perform such queries, unless \nCIA determines that there is a particular need to use a United States person identifier \nin such a query to conduct training on the implementation of an aspect of CIA 's \nsection 702 procedures; \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of CIA systems that process or \nstore section 702-acquired information;. \nan \n3.  (U)  comply with  order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight; \n4.  (U)  comply with the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, or the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. § 552a; \nSECRET//NOFORN \n4 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n5.  (U)  conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have \nnot been compromised; \n6.  (U)  identify infonnation that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter; or \n7.  (U)  perform the following lawful oversight functions of CIA's personnel or systems: \na.  (U) support CIA' s investigation and remediation of a possible FISA \ncompliance incident; \nb.  (U)  remediate a potential spill of classified FISA-acquired infonnation in \nCIA systems; \nc.  (U)  identify FISA-acquired infonnation subject to destruction, including \nunder CIA's section 702 minimization procedures; \nd.  (U)-ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin CIA's FISA minimization procedures;-or \ne.  (U) support CIA' s audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work done \nrelated to FISA collection by CIA personnel. \n(U)  Should CIA determine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those specified in this subsection (IV.C.7), CIA shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such a query.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation to \nthe FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary. \n(U)  Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsections IV.B.l, 3, and 4 above, CIA \nmust keep a record of any United States person query term used for a query of unminimized \nsection 702-acquired information in support of the activities described in this subsection \nIV.C . \nfra. \n.di'!tl \n~ \nWILLIAM P.

For the purposes of these procedures, the tenns \"Na~i9nal \nSecurity Agency\" and 11NSA persoMel\" refer to any employees ofNSA and any other-pers.onnel . \nengaged in Signals Intelligence (SIGCNT) operations authorized pursuant to section 702 ofthe \nAct if such operations are executed under the direction, authority, or control of the Director!' \nNSA/Chief, Central Security Service (DIRNSA). \nI. (lJ) DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE ACQUISITION TARGETS NON \nUNITED STATES PERSONS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE LOCATED OUTSIDE \nTHE UNITED STA  TES \n(S) NSA detennines whether a person is a non-United States person reasonably believed to be \noutside the United States in light of the totality of the circumstances based on the infonnation \navailable with respect to that person\n \n \n \n \n \n \n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) NSA analysts examine the following three categories of information, \nas appropriate under the circumstances, to make the above determination: (l) they examine the \nlead information they have received regarding the potential target or the facility that has \ngenerated interest in conducting swveillance to determine what that lead information discltises \nabout the person's location; (2) they conduct research in\n \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \nClassified by:  The Assistant Attorney General for National Security \nI  I  Derived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52 (dated 20180110) \nFILED UNDER SEAL \nDeclassify On: 204 70314 \n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n whether NSA \nknows the location of the person, or knows information that would provide evidence concerning \nthat location; and (3) they conduc to determine or \nverify information about the person1s location.  NSA may use information from any one or a \ncombination of these categories of information in evaluating the totality of the circumstances to \ndetermine that the potential target is located outside the United States. \n(TS//SI//NF) Acquisitions conducted under these procedures will not intentionally acquire \ncommunications that contain a reference to, but are not to or from, a person targeted in \naccordance with these procedures.  In addition, unless NSA  \n in those cases where NSA uses 11upstream\" collection techniques \nto acquire Internet transactions l to or from a person targeted in accordance with these \nprocedures,   \n \n \n{U) Lead Information \n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) When NSA proposes to direct surveillance at a target, it does so \nbecause NSA has already learned something about the target or the facility or facilities the target \nuses to communicate.  Accordingly, NSA will examine the lead information to determine what it \nreveals about the physical location of the target,\n \n(S//NF) The following are examples of the types of lead information that NSA may examine: \na)   \n \n \nb)   \n \nc)   \n \n \n1 (TS//SU/NF)  For purposes of these procedures, an \"Internet transaction\" is an Internet communication acquired \nthrough NSA's upstream collection techniques that may contain infonnation or data representing either a discrete \ncommunication (e.g., an e-mail message  or multiple discrete communication  \n \nAcquisitions of Internet transactions to or from a person targeted in \naccordance with these procedures are pennitted regardless of whether the transaction contains information or data \nrepresenting either a discrete communication or multiple discrete communications.  Acquisitions of Internet \ntransactions that are not to or from a person targeted in accordance with these procedures are not pennitted, \nregardless of whether the transaction contains a discrete communication to or from a person targeted in accordance \nwith these procedures. \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n2 \n\nTOP SECRET//Sl//NOFORN \nd)   \n \ne)   \n \n \n \n(U) Information NSA Has About the Target's Location and/or Facility or Facilities Used by \nthe Target \n(S//NF) NSA may also review information in its databases, including repositories of information \ncollected by NSA and by other intelligence agencies,   to \ndetermine if the person's location, or information providing evidence about the person's location, \nis already known.  The NSA databases that would be used for this purpose contain information \nculled from signals intelligence, human intelligence, law enforcement information, and other \nsources.  For example,   \n \n \n \n(S//NF) NSA  \n(S) NSA may also \nto assist it in making determinations concerning the \nlocation of the person at whom NSA intends to direct surveillance.  For example, NSA may \nexamine the following types of information: \n \n \nabout the person's location. \nb)  Review commercially available and NSA telephone numbering databases for \nindications of the type of telephone being used (e .g. landline, wireless mobile, \n \ntarget. \n(S//REL TO USA, FVEY) For electronic communications accounts/addresses/identifiers: \n \n \n \n(e .g., Media Access Control addresses) information, which NSA compares to information \n \n \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n3 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n(U) Assessment of the Non-United States Person Status of the Target \n(S//NF) In many cases, the information that NSA examines in order to determine whether a \ntarget is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States may also bear upon the non \nUnited States person status of that target.   \n \n \n  Similarly, information contained in NSA databases, including repositories of \ninformation collected by NSA or other agencies, may indicate that the target is a non-United \nStates person. \n(S//NF) Furthermore, in order to prevent the inadvertent targeting of a United States person, \nNSA   \n \nPrior to targeting, a particular telephone number or electronic communications account/address/ \n \n \n \n(U//FOUO) In the absence of specific information regarding whether a target is a United States \nperson, a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States or whose location is \nnot known will be presumed to be a non-United States person unless such person can be \npositively identified as a United States person, or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief \nthat such person is a United States person.  A person known to have been at any time an alien \nadmitted for lawful permanent residence will be presumed to be a United States person, unless a \ndetermination that such person is no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation \nwith the NSA Office of General Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that \nperson's United States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form I-407 (Record of Abandonment \nof Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the NSA Office of General \nCounsel and the National Security Division (NSD) of the Department of Justice. \n(U) Assessment of the Foreign Intelligence Purpose of the Targeting \n(U) NSA must also reasonably assess, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the target is \nexpected to possess, receive, and/or is likely to communicate foreign intelligence information \nconcerning a foreign power or foreign territory authorized for targeting under a certification or \nauthorization executed by the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General in the \nmanner prescribed by section 702.  This assessment must be particularized and fact-based, \ninformed by analytic judgment, the specialized training and experience of the analyst, as well as \nthe nature of the foreign intelligence information expected to be obtained.  In making this \nassessment NSA will consider the circumstances that led to NSA's identification of the intended \ntarget and other relevant factors which could include, among other things, the following: \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n4 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \na.

(U) POST-TARGETING ANALYSIS BY NSA \n(U) After a person has been targeted for acquisition by NSA, NSA will conduct post-targeting \nanalysis as described herein.  Such analysis is designed to detect those occasions when a person \nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n6 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \nwho when targeted was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States is located in \nthe United States, and will enable NSA to take steps to prevent the intentional acquisition of any \ncommunication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are known at the time of \nacquisition to be located in the United States, or the intentional targeting of a person who is \ninside the United States.  Such analysis may include: \na)  (S//NF) For telephone numbers: \n•   \n \n \n \n \n•  NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a foreign target is located in or \nintends to enter the United States.  Such content analysis will be conducted according to \nanalytic and intelligence requirements and priorities. \nb)  (S//NF) For electronic communications\n•   \n \n to determine if an electronic communications \n from inside the United States.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n•   \n \n \n \n \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n7 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n•  NSA analysts may analyze content for indications that a target is located in or intends to \nenter the United States.  Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic \nand intelligence requirements and priorities.3 \n(S//NF) IfNSA determines that a target is located in the United States, it will follow the \nprocedures set forth in section IV of this document, including the termination of the acquisition \nfrom the target without delay.  In cases where   \n \n, NSA will presume that the target is \nlocated in the United States and will terminate the acquisition from that target without delay.  If \nat a later time NSA determines that the target is in fact located outside the United States, NSA \nmay re-initiate the acquisition in accordance with these procedures. \n(U) NSA analysts will also analyze content for indications that a target is a United States \nperson.4  Such content analysis will be conducted according to analytic and intelligence \nrequirements and priorities.  If NSA determines that a target who at the time of targeting was \nbelieved to be a non-United States person is believed to be a United States person, it will follow \nthe procedures set forth in section IV of this document, including the termination of the \nacquisition from the target without delay. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3  \n \n \n \n \n \n4  \n \n \n \n \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n8 \n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n \n \n \nIII. (U) DOCUMENTATION \n(U) Analysts who request tasking will document in the tasking database a citation or citations to \nthe information that led them to reasonably believe that a targeted person is located outside the \nUnited States.  Before tasking is approved, the database entry for that tasking will be reviewed in \norder to verify that the database entry contains the necessary citations. \n(U) A citation is a reference that identifies the source of the information, such as a report number \nor communications intercept identifier, which NSA will maintain.  The citation will enable those \nresponsible for conducting oversight to locate and review the information that led NSA analysts \nto conclude that a target is reasonably believed to be located outside the United States. \n(U) Analysts also will identify the authorized foreign power or foreign territory about which they \nexpect to obtain foreign intelligence information pursuant to the proposed targeting, and will \nprovide a written explanation of the basis for their assessment, at the time of targeting, that the \ntarget possesses, is expected to receive, and/or is likely to communicate foreign intelligence \ninformation concerning that authorized foreign power or foreign territory. \nIV. (U) OVERSIGHT AND COMPLIANCE \n(U) NSA will conduct compliance and oversight activities, on an ongoing basis, with respect to \nits exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, including the associated targeting, \nminimization, and querying procedures adopted in accordance with section 702.  NSA will \ndevelop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure NSA personnel \nresponsible for approving the targeting of persons under these procedures, as well as NSA \npersonnel with access to the acquired foreign intelligence information understand their \nresponsibilities and the procedures that apply to this acquisition.  NSA has established processes \nfor ensuring that raw traffic is labeled and stored only in authorized repositories, and is \naccessible only to those who have had the proper training.  NSA will conduct ongoing oversight \nactivities and will make any necessary reports, including those relating to incidents of \nnoncompliance, to the NSA Inspector General and OGC, in accordance with its NSA \ncharter.  NSA will also ensure that necessary corrective actions are taken to address any \nidentified deficiencies. To that end, NSA will conduct periodic spot checks of targeting decisions \nand intelligence disseminations to ensure compliance with established procedures, and conduct \nperiodic spot checks of queries in data repositories. \n(U) The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence \n(ODNI) will conduct oversight ofNSA's exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, \nwhich will include periodic reviews by DOJ and ODNI personnel to evaluate the implementation \nof the procedures.  Such reviews will occur approximately once every two months. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n9 \n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil \nLiberties Protection Officer any incidents of noncompliance with these procedures by NSA \npersonnel that result in the intentional targeting of a person reasonably believed to be located in \nthe United States, the intentional targeting of a United States person, or the intentional \nacquisition of any communication in which the sender and all intended recipients are known at \nthe time of acquisition to be located within the United States.  NSA will provide such reports \nwithin five business days oflearning of the incident.  Any information acquired by intentionally \ntargeting a United States person or a person not reasonably believed to be outside the United \nStates at the time of such targeting will be purged from NSA databases. \n(U) NSA will report to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the National \nSecurity Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and oversight, to the ODNI \nOffice of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection Officer, any incidents of \nnoncompliance (including overcollection) by any electronic communication service provider to \nwhom the Attorney General and Director of National Intelligence issued a directive under \nsection 702.  Such report will be made within five business days after determining that the \nelectronic communication service provider has not complied or does not intend to comply with a \ndirective. \n(U) In the event that NSA concludes that a person is reasonably believed to be located outside \nthe United States and after targeting this person learns that the person is inside the United States, \nor if NSA concludes that a person who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non-United \nStates person is believed to be a United States person, it will take the following steps: \n1)  Terminate the acquisition without delay from all facilities tasked in accordance with \nthese procedures and used by that target, and determine whether to obtain \nauthorization under another section of the Act.  If NSA inadvertently acquires a \ncommunication sent to or from the target while the target is or was located inside the \nUnited States, including any communication where the sender and all intended \nrecipients are reasonably believed to be located inside the United States at the time of \nacquisition, such communication will be treated in accordance with the applicable \nminimization and querying procedures. \n2)  Report the incident to DOJ through the Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the \nNational Security Division with responsibility for intelligence operations and \noversight, to the ODNI Office of General Counsel, and to the ODNI Civil Liberties \nProtection Officer within five business days. \nV.

(U) These procedures apply to the querying of unminimized information, acquired pursuant \nto section 702 of the Foreign [ntelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as amended (\"FISA\" or ..t he \nAct\"), by the National Security Agency (\"NSA\"), and apply in addition to separate minimization \nprocedures for NSA adopted pursuant to subsection 702(e) of the Act (hereinafter, \"NSA's \nminimization procedures\"). These querying procedures should be read and applied in \nconjunction with those minimization procedures, and nothing in these procedures pennits any \nactions that would otherwise be prohibited by those minimization procedures. NSA personnel \nwho have completed training in these procedures and NSA' s section 702 minimization \nprocedures may query NSA systems containing unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act.  Authorized users with access to unminimized section 702-acquired \ninfonnation should process the results of an appropriate query of unminimized section 702-\nacquired information in accordance with NSA's applicable section 702 minimization procedures. \nII. (U) IfNSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these querying \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e .g., force protection or hostage \nsituations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures, NSA \nmay take such action immediately.  NSA will make a record of the action taken, to include any \nquery tenn(s) used, and report the action taken to the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence (\"ODNI\") and to the Department of Justice's National Security Division (\"NSD\"), \nwhich will promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (\"FISC\") of such activity. \nIII. (U) Definitions and Presumptions \nA.  (U) Definitions for purposes of these procedures \n(U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801 for the terms \n\"'Attorney General,\" \"foreign intelligence information,\" \"person,\" \"United States,\" and \n\"United States person.\" \n(S//NF)  When used to conduct a query, \"United States person query term\" means a term that \nis reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United States persons.  United States \nperson query terms may be either a single item of information or information that, when \ncombined with other information, is reasonably likely to identify one or more specific United \nStates persons.  Determining whether information is reasonably likely to identify one or more \nspecific United States persons in a particular context may require a case-by-case assessment \nby a trained intelligence professional. \"United States person query term\" is not limited to \nSECRET//NOFORN \nClassified by:  The Assistant Attorney General for National Security \nDerived From:  DOJ/NSI SCG 1 INT dated 20120701, 1.6 \nFILED UNDER SEAL \nDeclassify On:  20480313 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nany single category of information or technology.  Depending on the context, examples of \nUnited States person query terms may include: names or unique titles; government \nassociated personal or corporate identification numbers;\nand street address, telephone, and\nUnited States person query term does not include a reference to a product by brand or \nmanufacturer's name ( or related nomenclature, including part numbers) or the use of a name \nin a descriptive sense, as, for example, \"Ford Crown Victoria\" or \"Boeing 737,\" so long as \nsuch term is not intended to retrieve information concerning a specific United States person \n( e.g., \"Ford Crown Victoria with License Plate Number CBA 321 \"). \n(U)  Process or processing means any action necessary to convert unminimized section 702-\nacquired information into an intelligible form or any machine-initiated action designed to \nidentify, curate, label, or organize such information; provided, however, that the term \n\"process\" or \"processing\" does not include an action that: (1) presents information for human \ninspection; or (2) using means that do not involve human inspection, produces and makes \naffirmative use of information for investigative, intelligence analysis, or preventative \npurposes. \n\"Query\" means the use of one or more terms I to retrieve the unminimized contents \nor noncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located in an \nNSA system; provided, however, that the term \"query\" does not include: \n(1) a system user's query of a system that contains unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation, where the user does not receive unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation in response to the query either because the user has not been granted \naccess to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a user who \nhas been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve \nunminimized section 702-acquired information; \n(2) activities that constitute the processing of unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation; \n(3) a system user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the \nresults of that query based upon the attributes of the information retrieved;2 \n( 4) examining or manipulating, including by technical means, communications or \ndocuments for the purpose of minimizing such communications or documents;3 or \n(5) searches conducted in user activity monitoring systems, as described in NSA's \nsection 702 minimization procedures, so long as the only unminimized section 702-\n1 (S//NF)  Such terms may include the use of keywords, identifiers, \n \n2 (U)  For example, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the information actually \nreturned to a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n3 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all \ninstances of a known United States person's name with a generic term, such as \"U.S. Person l .\" \nSECRET//NOFORN \n2 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nacquired information that the searches run against are in records captured through \nuser activity monitoring. \n(U)  \"Contents\" means any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of a \ncommunication. \n(U)  \"Metadata\" means the dialing, routing, addressing, or signaling information associated \nwith a communication, but does not include information concerning the substance, purport, \nor meaning of the communication. \n(U)  The terms \"National Security Agency\" and \"NSA personnel\" refer to any employees of \nthe National Security Agency/Central Security Service (\"NSNCSS\" or \"NSA\") and any \nother personnel engaged in Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) operations authorized pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act if such operations are executed under the direction, authority, or \ncontrol of the Director, NSNChief, CSS (DIRNSA). \nB. (U)  Presumptions for purposes of these procedures \n(U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n1.  (U)  A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such person \nis not a United States person. \n2.  (U)  A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be \npositively identified as such or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such \nperson is a United States person. \n3.  (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the NSA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nNSA Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n4.  (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n3 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(U)  IV. Querying Procedures \nA.  (U)  Query Standard \n(U)  Each query of NSA systems containing unminimized .content or noncontent \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act must be reasonably likely to \nretrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA, unless otherwise \nspecifically excepted in these procedures.  Any United States person query term used to \nidentify and select unminimized section 702-acquired content must first be approved by \nNSA' s Office of General Counsel.  NSA personnel seeking such an approval must \nprovide a statement of facts establishing that the use of any such identifier as a selection \nterm is reasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by FISA. \nNSA may approve the use of a United States person query term to query unminimized \nsection 702-acquired content for no longer than a period of one year; such approvals may \nbe renewed for periods up to one year.  Any use of a United States person query term to \nquery unminimized section 702-acquired metadata must be accompanied by a statement \nof facts showing that the use of any such query term is reasonably likely to retrieve \nforeign intelligence information, as defined by FISA. \nB.  (U)  Creation and Maintenance of Query Records \n1.  (U)  NSA must generate and maintain an electronic record of each United States \nperson query term used for a query of unminimized information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702.  Such electronic record must, at a minimum, include the following \ninformation: \na.  (U)  the query term(s) used or approved; \nb.  (U)  the date of the query or approval of query term(s); \nc.  (U)  the identifier of the user who conducted the query or sought approval of \nthe query term(s); \nd.  (U)  the statement of facts showing that the use of the query term(s) is \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information, as defined by \nFISA; and \ne.  (U)  in the case of content queries, the approving official in NSA' s Office of \nGeneral Counsel and duration of the approval. \n2.  (U)  In the event it is impracticable for an NSA system to generate an electronic \nrecord, or in the event an unanticipated circumstance arises that prevents the \ngeneration of such an electronic record, NSA must generate and maintain a written \nrecord of each United States person query term that contains the same information \nrequired for electronic records, as described above.  Before conducting a query in a \nSECRET//NOFORN \n4 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nsystem that does not generate an electronic record of a query, NSA personnel must \nreasonably determine that conducting that query in a system that generates an \nelectronic record would be insufficient for technical, analytical, operational, or \nsecurity reasons. \n3.  (U)  NSA will maintain the query records required by this subsection in a manner that \nwill allow NSD and ODNI to conduct oversight and compliance in an effective \nmanner.  Such records (both electronic and written), including the statements of facts, \nmust be maintained at least five years from either the date of the query for queries of \nunminimized section 702-acquired metadata, or the date of the approval of the U.S. \nperson query term for queries of unminimized section 702-acquired content.  NSD \nand ODNI will conduct oversight ofNSA's activities with respect to United States \npersons that are conducted pursuant to these procedures. \nC.  (U)  Exceptions.  Notwithstanding subsections IV.A and IV.B.1.d-e above, nothing in \nthese procedures shall prohibit the lawful oversight functions ofNSD or ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or restrict NSA from providing the \nassistance necessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions, and \nnothing in these procedures shall prohibit NSA from conducting queries it determines are \nnecessary to: \n1.  (U)  NSA' s performance of lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the \nproper implementation of section 702 and NSA's section 702 procedures.  However, \nNSA shall use non-United States person identifiers to perform such queries, unless \nNSA determines that there is a particular need to use a United States person identifier \nin such a query to conduct training on the implementation of an aspect ofNSA's \nsection 702 procedures; \n2.  (U)  create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of NSA systems that process or \nstore section 702-acquired information; \n3.  (U)  comply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific \ncongressional mandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with \ncongressional oversight; \n4.  (U)  conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information acquired \npursuant to section 702 of the Act in order to ensure that its systems are not or have \nnot been compromised; \n5.  (U)  identify information that must be produced or preserved in connection with a \nlitigation matter; or \n6.  (U)  perform the following lawful oversight functions ofNSA's personnel or systems: \na.  (U)  support NSA' s investigation and remediation of a possible section 702 \ncompliance incident; \nSECRET//NOFORN \n5 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nb.  (U)  remediate a potential spill of classified section 702-acquired information \nin NSA systems; \nc.  (U)  identify section 702-acquired information subject to destruction, \nincluding under NSA's section 702 minimization procedures; \nd.  (U)  ensure the effective application of marking or segregation requirements \nin NSA' s section 702 minimization procedures; \ne.  (U)  support NSA's audit or review, for quality control purposes, of work \ndone related to section 702 collection by NSA personnel; or \nf.  (U)  identify and remove child exploitation material, including child \npornography, from NSA systems. \n(U)  Should NSA determine that it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those specified in this subsection (IV.C.6), NSA shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such a query.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation to \nthe FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary. \n(U)  Consistent with the requirements set forth in subsections IV.B. l .a-c, 2, and 3 above, \nNSA must keep a record of any United States person query term used for a query of \nunminimized section 702-acquired information in support of the activities described in this \nsubsection IV.C. \nD.  (S//NF)  NSA Support for U.S. Government Vetting of Non-United States Persons \nfor Counterterrorism Purposes.  Notwithstanding subsection IV .A of these procedures, \nNSA may use certain unminimized section 702-acquired information for valid \ncounterterrorism foreign intelligence purposes as directed to support the federal \ngovernment's vetting of non-United States persons who are being processed for travel to \nthe United States or a benefit under U.S. immigration laws (a \"travel or immigration \napplicant\").  Specifically, NSA may use section 702-acquired information to: \n1.   \n(a) non-United States person counterterrorism selectors that \nhave been tasked for Executive Order 12333 or section 702 acquisition;\n \n4  \n \n \n5   \n \n \nSECRET//NOFORN \n6 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n2.  Compare\nnon-United States person travel or immigration \napplicants,\n3.  Review the section 702-acquired information underpinning the match to assess \nthe analytic significance of the travel or immigration applicant's connection to an \ninternational terrorism target; \n4.  If required for analytic purposes, NSA may run one or more queries that are \nreasonably likely to retrieve foreign intelligence information consistent with \nsubsection IV.A above. \nIn step 2 above, NSA will not\nnon-United States person travel or immigration applicants \nthat NSA knows, or reasonably should know, are located or reside inside the United \nStates. \n~ \nMATTHEW G.

(U)  If it is not known whether an individual is located in or outside the United States, \nhe or she should be presumed to be a non-United States person unless the individual \nis identified as a United States person or the totality of circumstances gives rise to the \nreasonable belief that the individual is a United States person. \n5.  (U) Departures. \na.  (U)  If NCTC believes that a situation requires it to act inconsistently with these \nprocedures to protect the national security of the United States, or to protect life or \nproperty from serious harm, NCTC will promptly contact NSD to request that these \nprocedures be modified. Any modification to these procedures must be made in \naccordance with 50 U.S.C. § 188la(j)(l)(C). \nb.  (U)  If, in order to protect against an immediate threat to human life, NCTC \ndetermines that it must take action in apparent departure from these procedures and \nthat it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of these procedures in \naccordance with 50 U.S.C. § 1881a(j)(l)(C), NCTC shall promptly report the action \ntaken to NSD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). NSD \n3 \n\n:!lf!Clm'f 11'NO POltf C \nwill promptly notify the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) of any such \nactivity. \n6.  (U) Nothing in these procedures shall prohibit: 1 \na.  (U) The retention or processing of information necessary for the maintenance of \ntechnical databases, so long as only administrative or technical personnel have access \nto such databases; \nb.  (U) The retention or processing of information in emergency data backup systems, \nprovided that only administrative or technical personnel have access to such systems. \nIn the event that information from such systems must be used to restore lost, \ndestroyed, or inaccessible data, NCTC shall apply these procedures to the transferred \ndata; \nc.  (U)  NCTC's access to minimized section 702-acquired information that FBI (except \nas provided in Section E), NSA, or the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) may \ndisseminate to NCTC pursuant to their respective FISC-authorized minimization \nprocedures; \nd.  (U)  The retention, processing, analysis, or dissemination of information necessary to \ncomply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific congressional \nmandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with congressional \noversight; \ne.  (U)  The lawful oversight functions ofNSD, ODNI, or the applicable Offices of the \nInspectors General, or the provision by NCTC of the assistance necessary. for these \nentities to perform their lawful oversight functions; \nf.

(U) NCTC's activities necessary to perform the following lawful oversight functions \nof its personnel or systems: \n(a) (U)  investigate and remediate possible FISA compliance incidents; or \n(b) (U)  identify section 702-acquired information subject to destruction, \nincluding under these minimization procedures. \n(U)  Should NCTC detennine it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom the two exceptions described in this subsection (A.6.g.), NCTC shall consult \nwith NSD and ODNI prior to conducting such an activity. NSD shall promptly report \nthe deviation to the FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation \n1 (U)  Whenever relying on any portion of this provision to deviate from any other provision of these minimization \nprocedures, NCTC personnel shall limit the scope of their deviation and comport with all other provisions of these \nminimization procedures to the maximum extent practicable. \n~19~M. .~ fJ'191i910f \n4 \n\nlJ~@lt@'PH'UOPOMf \nfrom the procedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the \ndeviation was necessary.  Once section 702-acquired information is no longer \nreasonably believed to be necessary for a lawful oversight function, the information \nshall be destroyed to the extent required by the applicable provisions of these \nprocedures. \n7.  (U)  Compliance with Crimes Reporting Obligations.  Notwithstanding other \nprovisions of these minimization procedures, information that is not foreign intelligence \ninformation, but reasonably appears to be evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or \nis about to be committed, may be retained and disseminated (including United States \nperson identities) to the FBI and other appropriate federal law enforcement authorities, in \naccordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b) and 1825(c), Executive Order No. 12333 (as \namended), and any other applicable crimes reporting requirements or procedures. \n8.  (U)  Identification of Information.  Except as specifically provided herein, all \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act and provided to NCTC in raw \nform shall be identified in NCTC records, systems, documents, disseminations, and other \nproducts as having been acquired pursuant to the Act.  This requirement applies to \ninformation regardless of whether NCTC has subjected it to minimization procedures. \nB.  (U)  RETENTION \nI.  (U)  NCTC may maintain raw section 702-acquired information.  Raw section 702-\nacquired information must be maintained in a manner that (a) clearly identifies it as raw \nsection 702 information acquired pursuant to the Act, (b) only permits such information \nto be accessed by NCTC personnel who have received training in applying these \nprocedures to raw section 702-acquired information, and (c) enables NCTC to mark or \notherwise identify communications or other information that meet the standard set forth \nin paragraph B(3) herein.  Notwithstanding the access restriction above, NCTC personnel \nwho are undergoing, but have not yet completed, training regarding the proper \nimplementation of section 702 and NCTC's section 702 procedures, may have access to \nraw section 702-acquired information during the conduct of such training and insofar as \nreasonably necessary for it to be effective.  The retention provisions herein apply \nnotwithstanding other Attorney General guidelines governing NCTC's retention of \ninformation. \n2.  (U)  Subject to the above: \na.  (U)  Raw section 702-acquired information in NCTC systems that NCTC does not \nreview shall be destroyed five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection unless the Assistant Director for Intelligence or the \nAssistant Director for Identity Intelligence ofNCTC determines that an extension is \nnecessary because the information is reasonably believed to contain significant \nforeign intelligence information, or evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed.  An extension under this paragraph may apply to a specific \ncategory of information, and must be documented in writing, renewed on an annual \n81!!t!l\\i!'f/;1'(6 f 6 M4 \n5 \n\n81!@Mif11lf fiJIF8Rff \nbasis, and promptly reported to ODNI and NSD, which will promptly notify the FISC \nin writing of all such detenninations. \nb.  (U)  Raw section 702-acquired information that NCTC reviews, but does not mark or \notherwise identify as meeting the standard set forth in paragraph 8(3) herein, may be \nretained and be fully accessible by authorized personnel for further review and \nanalysis for ten years from the expiration date of the certification authorizing the \ncollection. No longer than ten years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection, access to such information in electronic and data storage \nsystems will be limited to search capabilities that would produce notice to an \nauthorized user that information responsive to a query exists.  Approval from the \nAssistant Director for Intelligence or the Assistant Director for Identity Intelligence \nof NCTC or designee will be required to gain full access to the information. \nInformation that has not been marked or otherwise identified as meeting the standard \nset forth in paragraph 8(3) shall be destroyed no later than fifteen years from the \nexpiration date of the certification authorizing the collection of the information unless \nspecific authority is obtained from the Director ofNCTC and NSD to retain the \ninformation, and the FISC approves a new retention period upon a finding that such \nmodification is consistent with the applicable statutory definition of \"minimization \nprocedures.\" \nc.  (U) Any communications acquired pursuant to section 702 that contain a reference \nto, but are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with section 702 targeting \nprocedures are unauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed upon \nrecognition.2 \n3.  (U) Nonpublicly available information concerning an unconsenting United States person \nthat the NCTC personnel responsible for applying these procedures has determined \nreasonably appears to be foreign intelligence infonnation, to be necessary to understand \nforeign intelligence information or assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime \nmay also be retained and used for further analysis without the limitations set forth in \nparagraph B(l) above.  Such information shall be clearly identified in NCTC systems and \nrecords as information that was acquired pursuant to FISA and that is subject to these \nprocedures.  These procedures do not limit the time period for which NCTC may retain \nsuch information.  Information that is evidence ofa crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed, but is not foreign intelligence information, may only be retained \nand disseminated for law enforcement purposes. \n4.  (U)  Any information received by NCTC that is acquired through the targeting of a \nperson who at the time of targeting was reasonably believed to be a non-United States \nperson located outside the United States but is in fact located inside the United States at \nthe time such information is acquired or is subsequently determined to be a United States \nperson will be promptly destroyed upon recognition, unless the Director ofNCTC \nspecifically determines in writing that each specific item of acquired information to be \n2 (U)  In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked selector is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \noe@Mifh:PHJP 8RPf \n6 \n\n:]~C~ThNOPOft'l'~ \nretained is reasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information or \nevidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be committed. \n5.  (U) NCTC may temporarily retain specific section 702-acquired information that would \notherwise have to be destroyed under these procedures, if NSD determines that such \ninformation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  Such determination shall be made in writing \nand shall identify the specific information to be retained and the particular litigation for \nwhich it is retained.  Personnel unconnected to the particular litigation matter shall not \naccess the raw section 702-acquired information that is being temporarily retained for \nsuch litigation matter.  Personnel shall only access the information being retained for \nlitigation-related reasons on a case-by-case basis after consultation with NSD.  Once \nsection 702-acquired information is no longer reasonably believed to be necessary for, or \npotentially discoverable in, such litigation matters, the information shall be promptly \ndestroyed pursuant to these procedures.  Each year, NCTC will provide NSD with a \nsummary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating \npreservation of section 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a \ndestruction requirement pursuant to these procedures, (b) a description of the section 702-\nacquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and ( c) if possible, based \non the information available to NCTC, a description of the status of each such litigation \nmatter. \n(U)  NCTC may retain specific section 702-acquired information subject to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures ifNSD determines that such \ninfonnation is reasonably believed to be necessary for, or potentially discoverable in, \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  NCTC will provide NSD with a summary of: \n(a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of \nsection 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to a destruction \nrequirement other than those specified in these procedures, (b) a description of the section \n702-acquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and ( c) if possible, \nbased on the information available to NCTC, a description of the status of each such \nlitigation matter.  NSD will promptly notify and subsequently seek authorization from the \nFISC to retain the information as appropriate and consistent with law.  NCTC will restrict \naccess to and retain such information in the manner described in the paragraph above \nuntil either the FISC denies a government request for authorization to retain the \ninfonnation or the Department of Justice notifies NCTC in writing that such infonnation \nis no longer required to be preserved for such litigation matters.  After receiving such \nnotice, NCTC shall promptly destroy such section 702-acquired information. \nC.  (U)  PROCESSING \n1.  (U)  Queries of unminimized content or noncontent information acquired in accordance \nwith section 702 of the Act are governed by the Querying Procedures Used by the \nNational Counterterrorism Center in Connection with Acquisitions of Foreign \nIntelligence Information Pursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \nAct of 1978, as Amended.  All such queries conducted by NCTC personnel must be made \n81!1@MJT,%'1f8f81¥1 \n7 \n\n1'1!:ClfflTnHOPOltH \nin accordance with those procedures.  Authorized NCTC users with access to \nunminimized section 702-acquired information should process the results of an \nappropriate query of unminimized section 702-acquired information in accordance with \nthese minimization procedures. \n2.  (U)  NCTC may make raw section 702-acquired information available to authorized \nNCTC personnel on a continuing basis for review, translation, analysis, and use in \naccordance with these procedures. Authorized NCTC personnel may continue to access \nraw section 702-acquired information to determine whether it reasonably appears to be \nforeign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation, or necessary to assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, \nnotwithstanding the fact that other NCTC personnel may have previously evaluated such \ninformation. \n3.  (U) NCTC personnel may query NCTC electronic and data storage systems that contain \nmetadata to find, extract, and analyze metadata pertaining to communications acquired \nunder section 702 of the Act, regardless of whether such communications are determined \nto satisfy the standards set forth in these procedures for retention or dissemination. Such \nqueries must be reasonably likely to return foreign intelligence information, as defined in \nFISA.  NCTC may use such metadata to analyze communications and may upload or \ntransfer some or all of such metadata to NCTC electronic and data storage systems for \nauthorized foreign intelligence purposes.  Section 702-acquired metadata shall be \nidentified as such in NCTC data repositories and shall be subject to the retention time \nperiods specified in paragraphs B(2) and B(3).  Any dissemination outside ofNCTC of \nmetadata from communications acquired under section 702 of the Act must be made in \naccordance with the applicable provisions of these procedures. \n4.  (U)  Sensitive Information.  Particular care should be taken when reviewing information \nthat is sensitive information, as defined below.  No sensitive information may be used in \nan analysis or report unless it is first determined that such information reasonably appears \nto be foreign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, or evidence of a crime.  Information that reasonably \nappears to be foreign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information, or necessary to assess the importance of foreign intelligence \ninformation may be retained, processed, and disseminated in accordance with these \nprocedures even if it is sensitive information.  Information that reasonably appears to be \nevidence of a crime may be retained, processed, and disseminated for law enforcement \npurposes in accordance with these procedures, even if it is sensitive information. \nSensitive information consists of: \na.  (U)  Religious activities of United States persons, including consultations with clergy; \nb.  (U)  Educational and academic activities of United States persons, including \nconsultations among professors or other teachers and their students; \n813CRl3'FJi'N0F0:RN \n8 \n\nc.

(U)  Medical, psychiatric, or psychotherapeutic activities of United States persons; \nand \ng.  (U)  Matters pertaining to United States person minor children, including student \nrequests for information to aid in academic endeavors. \n5.  (U)  Privileged Communications. NCTC may receive unminimized communications, \nacquired pursuant to section 702 ofFISA, to which an attorney is a party.  These \nprovisions address the retention, dissemination, and use of information in such \ncommunications and apply when NCTC personnel processing a communication acquired \npursuant to section 702 of FISA determine (based on the information in the \ncommunication or other infonnation of which the NCTC processing personnel are aware) \nthat the communication is between an attorney (or any person who, based on the \ninformation in the communication, appears clearly to be communicating on behalf of an \nattorney, such as a paralegal or administrative assistant) and a client. \na.  (U)  After discovering such a communication, ifNCTC personnel processing a \ncommunication make an affirmative determination that the communication does not \ncontain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a crime, the communication \nmust be destroyed irrespective of whether the communication contains information \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. \nb.  (U)  lf NCTC personnel processing such a communication determine that the \ncommunication appears to contain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a \ncrime, the personnel processing the communication must bring the communication to \nthe attention of the office of NCTC Legal Counsel for action as set forth below. \nC. \ncommunication contains privileged information pertaining to a criminal charge in the \nUnited States, the communication shall be segregated. \nd. \nOl!@ll!!l\"'ft5Pt5ft.H \n9 \n\n813 OM'F,t;:NO PCUU f \ne. \nf. \ng.  Ei 'Qin;~  dissemination of attorney-\nclient privileged information of the type described in subparagraphs (c) and (e) above \noutside NCTC shall be limited to the greatest extent practicable, accompanied by \nappropriate handling controls, and shall include language advising recipients (I) that \nthe report contains information obtained from communications that may be subject to \nthe attorney-client privilege, (2) that use of the information is provided for \nintelligence purposes only and may not be used in any trial, hearing, or other \nproceeding absent express approval by the Attorney General, and (3) that further \ndissemination is prohibited absent express approval of the Assistant Attorney General \nfor National Security or his or her designee. \nh. \nSEeM:T/tr48t'6M4 \n10 \n\nNCTC shall keep a record of all \ndisseminations outside NCTC of attorney-client privileged information of the type \ndescribed in subparagraphs (c ) and (e ) above. \nD.  (U)  DISSEMINATION AND DISCLOSURE \nl.  (U)  Nothing in these procedures authorizes the dissemination of non-publicly available \ninformation that identifies any United States person without such person's consent \nunless:  (I) such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance; (2) the information is foreign intelligence \ninformation as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 180l(e)(l); or (3) the information is evidence of a \ncrime which has been, is being, or is about to be committed and that is to be disseminated \nfor law enforcement purposes. \n(U) NCTC may disseminate to federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal agencies or \nofficials with responsibilities relating to national security that require access to foreign \nintelligence information any nonpublicly available information concerning an \nunconsenting United States person that reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, necessary to understand foreign intelligence information, or necessary to \nassess the importance of foreign intelligence information, if the United States person \nidentity is deleted or otherwise sanitized to prevent the search, retrieval, or review of the \nidentifying information.  A generic term may be substituted which does not identify the \nUnited States person in the context of the data.  If the information cannot be sanitized in \nsuch a manner because such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign \nintelligence information or assess its importance, NCTC may disseminate that identity. \nNCTC may only disclose section 702-acquired or section 702-derived information \nreceived from NSA or FBI in raw form as provided herein. \n2.  (U)  Information that is evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be \ncommitted, but is not foreign intelligence information, may only be retained and \ndisseminated for law enforcement purposes. \n3.  (U)  Dissemination to Foreign Governments:  NCTC may disseminate to officials of \nforeign governments section 702-acquired information concerning United States persons \nthat reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, is necessary to understand \nforeign intelligence information or assess its importance, or is evidence of a crime being \ndisseminated for a law enforcement purpose, either if the Attorney General approves the \ndissemination or subject to the following procedures and consistent with Department of \nJustice guidance: \n.l~~lt!!!THT-teff effl' 4 \n11 \n\na. \nb. \n■ \nCTC shall undertake reasonable steps \nto ensure that the disseminated information will be used in a manner consistent with \nUnited States law, including Executive Order No. 12333 (as amended) and applicable \nfederal criminal statutes. \n4.  (U)  In addition to disseminations otherwise permitted by these procedures, NCTC may \ndisclose to FBI, CIA, and/or NSA raw section 702-acquired information, provided that \nthe receiving agency handle such raw information in accordance with FJSC-approved \nminimization and querying procedures applicable to that agency.  All disclosures of raw \ninformation under this paragraph shall be conducted in a manner that clearly indicates to \nthe receiving agency or agencies that the disclosed information is raw section 702-\nacquired information. \n5.  (U)  Procedures for Technical or Linguistic Assistance. NCTC may receive \ninformation or communications that, because of their technical or linguistic content, may \nrequire further analysis by other federal agencies ( collectively, \"assisting federal \nagencies\") to assist NCTC in determining their meaning or significance.  Consistent with \n66 iilliFi:1$fQli1Qllar \n12 \n\n~ 6 6MiiF.\\lft f0 1?0 Rf f \nthe other provisions of these procedures, NCTC is authorized to disclose raw section 702-\nacquired information to assisting federal agencies for further processing and analysis. \nThe following restrictions apply with respect to any materials so disseminated: \na.  (U)  Disclosure to assisting federal agencies will be solely for translation or analysis \nof such information or communications.  Assisting federal agencies will make no use \nof any information or any communication of or concerning any person except to \nprovide technical or linguistic assistance to NCTC. \nb.  (U)  Disclosure will be only to those personnel within assisting federal agencies \ninvolved in the translation or analysis of such infonnation or communications. The \nnumber of such personnel shall be restricted to the extent reasonably feasible.  There \nshall be no further disclosure of this raw data within assisting federal agencies. \nc.  (U)  Assisting federal agencies shall make no pennanent agency record of \ninfonnation or communications of or concerning any person referred to in section \n702-acquired infonnation disclosed by NCTC to assisting federal agencies, provided \nthat assisting federal agencies may maintain such temporary records as are necessary \nto enable them to assist NCTC with the translation or analysis of such information. \nRecords maintained by assisting federal agencies for this purpose may not be \ndisclosed within the assisting federal agency, except to personnel involved in \nproviding technical assistance to NCTC. \nd.  (U)  Upon the conclusion of such technical assistance to NCTC, all copies in any \nform of the section 702-acquired infonnation will either be returned to NCTC or be \ndestroyed, with an accounting of such destruction made to NCTC. \ne.  (U)  Any information that assisting federal agencies provide to NCTC as a result of \nsuch technical assistance may be disseminated by NCTC in accordance with the \napplicable minimization procedures. \nf. \n6.  (U)  Caveats. \na.  (U)  Disseminations pursuant to paragraphs D(l) or (2) by NCTC of section 702-\nacquired or -derived information to federal, state, local, territorial, or tribal agencies \nor officials of or within the United States will bear a legend indicating, in substance, \nthat:  (i) the dissemination includes FISA-acquired or FISA-derived information; (ii) \nthe information, and any information derived therefrom, may only be used in, or in \nSEEftE1'/J1~6fi'61tN \n13 \n\n8E)Cflf3iifl/i'P,O FOftff \nconnection with, a domestic or foreign legal or administrative proceeding with the \nadvance authorization of the Attorney General; and (iii) any reproduction, \ndissemination, or communication (including but not limited to oral briefings) of the \ndisseminated information must be accompanied by a statement of these restrictions. \nWherever feasible, NCTC will indicate which portions of documents contain FISA \nacquired or FISA-derived information, to permit recipients to identify the information \nto which the PISA-related restrictions apply. \nb.  (U)  All disseminations pursuant to paragraph 0(3) by NCTC of section 702-acquired \ninformation will bear a legend indicating that the disseminated information may not \nbe used or disseminated for any purpose by the recipient without the advance \nauthorization of the Director ofNCTC. Such legend need not indicate that the \ninformation was acquired pursuant to FISA.  NCTC shall refer any request for \nauthorization to use or disseminate section 702-acquired information to NSA or FBI \nHeadquarters, as appropriate. This caveat and authorization process may also be \nsubstituted for the caveat and process in subparagraph D(6)(a) for specific \ndisseminations under circumstances (e.g., security concerns) that require \nnondisclosure of the agency that collected the disseminated information, or \nnondisclosure of the authority pursuant to which the disseminated information was \nacquired. \nc.  (U)  Any dissemination made for a law enforcement purpose must bear a caveat \nstating, in substance, that the disseminated information may only be used in a legal or \nadministrative proceeding with the advance authorization of the Attorney General. \n7.

Disseminations made \npursuant to this provision are not subject to the caveat requirements set forth above in \nsubparagraphs D(6)(a), (b), and (c). \nE.  (U) INFORMATION IN FBI GENERAL INDICES \n(8//HF)  With respect to section 702-acquired information that FBI has determined \nsatisfies the applicable retention and dissemination requirements in the FBI Section 702 \nMinimization Procedures, and that FBI has uploaded or otherwise placed into FBI \ngeneral indices (such as the Automated Case Support (ACS) system, Sentinel, or \nsuccessor systems) under case classifications that are reasonably likely to contain \ninformation related to terrorism or counterterrorism, the following provisions shall apply. \nNone of the following provisions affect additional restrictions that FBI may impose on \nthe retention, use, or dissemination of such information: \nS~@ft<EFJlh'PtOt'OltM \n14 \n\nJECftEthUOPOll!f \nI.  (U)  For the purpose of these procedures, NCTC may consider all section 702-acquired \ninformation that it accesses in FBI general indices, and that reasonably appears to be \nforeign intelligence information, necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation, or necessary to assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, to \nhave been disseminated by FBI to NCTC in accordance with the FBI Section 702 \nMinimization Procedures. \n2.  (U) If NCTC accesses section 702-acquired infonnation in FBI general indices that is \nevidence of a crime, but does not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information \nor necessary to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, \nNCTC may not retain, use, or disseminate this information. \n3.  (U)  lfNCTC ingests or transfers section 702-acquired information from FBI general \nindices into NCTC systems before reviewing such information, NCTC may presume that \nsuch information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, is necessary \nto understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, or is evidence \nof a crime. If NCTC discovers any section 702-acquired information transferred from \nFBI general indices to NCTC systems that NCTC determines is evidence of a crime, but \ndoes not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information or necessary to \nunderstand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, NCTC shall \npromptly remove such information from all NCTC systems. \n4.  (U)  NCTC personnel may only access FBI general indices, or review section 702-\nacquired information from FBI general indices that has been ingested or transferred into \nNCTC systems, if they first receive training regarding these limitations. \nF.  (U)  TRAINING, DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS, AND OVERSIGHT \n1.  (U)  In consultation with NSD and ODNI, NCTC will develop and deliver training \nregarding the applicable procedures to ensure NCTC personnel responsible for applying \nthese procedures understand their responsibilities under these procedures. \n2.  (U)  NCTC will ensure that raw section 702-acquired information is only accessible to \nNCTC personnel (as defined above) who have received the required'training. NCTC will \nmaintain logs or records of users authorized to access the raw information.  NCTC will \nensure that the marking, moving, or other identification of information received in raw \nform as meeting the standard set forth in paragraph B(3) is tracked and auditable, and that \na user who moves a particular communication is identifiable. \n3.  (U)  All section 702-acquired information retained by NCTC will be retained under \nappropriately secure conditions that limit access to such information only to authorized \nusers and recipients in accordance with these procedures.  The retention procedures \nherein apply to section 702-acquired information retained in any form.

(U)  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 180J(h), 1821(4), and 188la(c)(l)(A), these \nFederal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) minimization procedures govern the acquisition, retention, \nand dissemination of nonpublicly available infonnation concerning unconsenting United States \npersons that is acquired by targeting non-United States persons reasonably believed to be located \noutside the United States pursuant to section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of \n1978, as amended (FISA or \"the Act\"), 50 U.S.C. § 1881a. The Attorney General, in \nconsultation with the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), has adopted these procedures after \nconcluding that they meet the requirements under 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801(h) and 1821(4) because \nthey are specific procedures that are reasonably designed in light of the purpose and technique of \nthe particular surveillance or physical search to minimize the acquisition and retention, and \nprohibit the dissemination, of nonpublicly available infonnation concerning unconsenting United \nStates persons consistent with the need of the United States to obtain, produce, and disseminate \nforeign intelligence information and otherwise comport with the statutory definition of \nminimization procedures.  In accordance with 50 U.S.C. § 3024(f)(6), the DNI has provided \nassistance to the Attorney General with respect to the dissemination procedures set forth herein \nso that FISA-acquired infonnation may be used efficiently and effectively for foreign \nintelligence purposes. These minimization procedures apply in addition to separate querying \nprocedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702(f)(l) of the Act.  These minimization procedures \nshould be read and applied in conjunction with those querying procedures, and nothing in these \nprocedures permits any actions that would otherwise be prohibited by those qu_erying procedures. \nB.  (U)  For the purpose of these procedures: \n1.  the term \"applicable FISA authority\" refers to section 702 of the Act; \n81JORIJlf)~fJ 8F81Vf \nI \n\n819@MifWNOFOllff \n2.  references to \"infonnation acquired pursuant to FISA\" and \"PISA-acquired \ninformation\" will be understood to mean communications and information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act; and \n3.  References to \"target\" will be understood to refer to the user(s) of a tasked \nfacility. \nC.  (U) Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(a), no infonnation acquired pursuant to FISA may be \nused or disclosed by Federal officers or employees except for lawful purposes.  Information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 concerning United States persons may be used and disclosed by \nFederal offic.ers and employees without the consent of the United States persons only in \naccordance with these minimization procedures. These procedures do not apply to publicly \navailable information concerning United States persons, nor do they apply to information that is \nacquired, retained, or disseminated with a United States person's consent.  In addition, except for \nthe provisions set forth below regarding the handling of information that is acquired in a manner \ninconsistent with certain of the limitations set forth in section 702(b), the use or disclosure of \ninformati-0n as described in Section III.H.1 of these procedures, attorney-client communications, \nthe use of FISA-acquired information in criminal proceedings in the United States and foreign \ncountries, and the disclosure of raw PISA-acquired information to other agencies, these \nprocedures do not apply to information concerning non-United States persons. \nD.  (U) These procedures adopt the definitions set forth in 50 U.S.C. § 1801, including those \nfor the tenns \"foreign intelligence information\" and \"United States person.\"  For purposes of \nthese procedures, if an individual is known to be located in the United States, he or she should be \npresumed to be a United States person unless the individual is identified as an alien who has not \nbeen admitted for permanent residence or circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that the \n2 \n\nSECHlWNOfOR-N \nindividual is not a United States person.  If an individual is known to be located outside the \nUnited States, he or she should be presumed to be a non-United States person unless the \nindividual is identified as a United States person or circumstances give rise to the reasonable \nbelief that the individual is a United States person.  If it is not known whether an individual is \nlocated in or outside of the United States, he or she should be presumed to be a non-United \nStates person unless the individual is identified as a United States person or circumstances give \nrise to the reasonable belief that the individual is a United States person. A person known to have \nbeen at any time an alien admitted for lawful pennanent residence is treated as a United States \nperson, unless a detennination that such person is no longer a United States person is made (a) in \nconsultation with the FBI Office of General Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order \nrevoking that person's United States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly \nexecuted and filed United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Pemianent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the FBI Office \nof General Counsel and the National Security Division (NSD) of the Department of Justice. \nE.  (U) If FBI personnel, which, for the purposes of these procedures, includes all \ncontractors and others authorized to work under the direction and control of the FBI on FISA-\nrelated matters, encounter a situation that they believe requires them to act inconsistently with \nthese procedures in order to protect the national security of the United States, enforce the \ncriminal law, or protect life or property from serious harm, those personnel immediately should \ncontact FBI Headquarters and NSD's Office of Intelligence to request that these procedures be \nmodified. Any modification to these procedures must be made in accordance with 50 U.S.C. \n§ 188laG)(l)(C). \nSECRE:rlfPiOFORPii \n3 \n\n80 Oftfi'fi,f.lf JOFOIVf \nF.  (U) If, in order to protect against an immediate threat to human life, the FBI determines \nthat it must take action in apparent departure from these procedures and that it is not feasible to \nobtain a timely modification of these procedures in accordance with 50 U.S.C. § 188la(j)(l)(C), \nthe FBI shall report that activity promptly to the NSD, which shall notify the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Court (FISC) promptly of such activity. \nG.  (U)  Nothing in these procedures1 shall restrict the lawful oversight functions of the NSD, \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence (ODN[), or the applicable Offices of the \nInspectors General or restrict FBI from providing the assistance necessary for these entities to \nperfonn their lawful oversight functions. Notwithstanding the access and review restrictions in \nSections III.A. I and 111.C.1.a of these procedures,2 respectively, FBI personnel who are \nundergoing, but have not yet completed, training regarding the proper implementation of FISA \nand the FBl's FISA procedures, including its section 702 procedures, may have access to and \nreview raw section 702-acquired information during the conduct of such training to the extent \nreasonably necessary for the training to be effective.3  The review restrictions in Section HI.C. l .a \nof these procedures shall not restrict the FBI's ability to perform activities necessary to create, \n1 (U) Whenever relying on any portion of Section I.G. of these procedures to deviate from any provision of these \nminimization procedures, FBI personnel shall limit the scope of their deviation and comport with all other \nprovisions of these minimization procedures to the maximum extent practicable. \n2 (U) Specifically, as provided in Ill.A. I, \"FBI personnel with access to raw FISA-acquired information must \nreceive training on these minimization procedures before receiving access to raw FISA•acquired information.\" And, \nas provided in HI.C. I .a, FBI may make raw F(SA-acquired information available to authorized personnel on a \ncontinuing basis ... to determine whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence infonnation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime.\" \nAs further provided in 111.C.1.a, \"FBI personnel with authorized access to raw Fl SA-acquired information may \nreview, translate, copy, transcribe, analyze, summarize, and use all such information ... only as necessary for the \npurpose of evaluating or determining whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence ofa crime.\" \n3 (U) Although the access and review restrictions in Section Ill of these procedures do not restrict the FBl's ability \nto perfonn lawful training functions of its personnel regarding the proper implementation of provisions ofFISA \nother than section 702, these procedures do not authorize such training. The minimization procedures applicable to \ncollection acquired pursuant to provisions ofFISA other than section 702 dictate whether\"such training is pennitted. \n8l!!@MTH5PiffJP81tPif \n4 \n\ntest, or conduct technical maintenance of the functions of FBI systems that process or store \nsection 702-acquired information. Additionally, nothing in these procedures shall prohibit the \nretention, processing, analysis, or dissemination of information necessary to comply with an \norder of a court within the United States or a specific congressional mandate, such as a subpoena \nor other similar process consistent with congressional oversight.  Similarly, and notwithstanding \nany other section in these procedures, the FBI may use information acquired pursuant to section \n702 of the Act to conduct security assessments of its systems in order to ensure that FBI systems \nhave not been compromised. These security assessments may include, but are not limited to, the \ntemporary retention of section 702-acquired information in a separate system for a period not to \nexceed one year.  While retained in such a system for security assessments, such section 702-\nacquired information may not be accessed for any other purpose.  Any information retained for \nthis purpose may be disseminated only in accordance with the applicable provisions of these \nprocedures. \nH.  (3)) l4i ) Nothing in these procedures4 shall restrict the FBI' s ability to review section \n702-acquired information that FBI determines is necessary to remediate a potential spill of \nsection 702-acquired information.  In addition, nothing in these procedures shall restrict the \nFBI's ability to review, retain, and disclose section 702-acquired information that FBI \ndetermines is necessary to support FBI's investigation and remediation of a possible FISA \ncompliance incident or FBI's activities necessary to identify section 702-acquired information \nsubject to destruction, including under these minimization procedures. \n4 (U)  Whenever relying on any portion of Section I.H. of these procedures to deviate ftom any provision of these \nminimization procedures, FBI personnel shall limit the scope of their deviation and comport with all other \nprovisions of these minimization procedures to the maximum extent practicable. \nSE€M1'1Y/N8F8Ri'♦ \n5 \n\n81!@Mrp111ffOPOMf \nhould the FBI detennine it is necessary to deviate from an \naspect of these minimization procedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or \nsystems apart from the exceptions described above in this section (I.H.), the Fm shall consult \nwith NSD and ODNI prior to conducting such activity.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation \nto the FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the procedures and \nidentify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was necessary.  Once section 702-\nacquired information is no longer reasonably believed to be necessary for a lawful oversight \nfunction, the information shall be destroyed to the extent required by the applicable provisions of \nthese procedures. \nII.  (U) ACQUISITION \nA.  tS:VtJF)  Acquisition of \n~'5:':'lalf)  The FBI may acquire \nursuant to section 702 of the Act \nonly in accordance with FBI targeting procedures that have been adopted by the Attorney \nGeneral, in consultation with the DNI, pursuant to section 702(d) of the Act. \n2.  (U) As soon as FBI personnel recognize that an acquisition of information under \nsection 702 of this Act is inconsistent with any of the limitations set forth in section 702(b ), 5 the \n5 \n(U) Subsection 702(b) provides that \"(a]n authorization authorized under subsection (a)•-\n( I) may not intentionally target any person known at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United \nStates; \n(2) may not intentionally target a person reasonably believed to be located outside the United States if the \npurpose of such acquisition is to target a panicular, known person reasonably believed to be located in the \nUnited States; \n8E€M'f//l'i8F8:RN \n6 \n\nSECRE'FHNOPORN \nFBI will purge the information and destroy all other copies of that infonnation that are accessible \nto any end user electronically or in hard copy.  Any electronic copies of the infonnation that are \nnot available to any end user but are available to a systems administrator as an archival back-up \nwill be restricted and destroyed in accordance with nonnal business practices and will not be \nmade available to any other person.  In the event FBI archival back-up data is used to restore an \nelectronic and data storage system, the FBI will ensure that the previously deleted information \nwill not be accessible to any user and will be deleted from any storage system. \n3.  (U) Any communications acquired pursuant to section 702 that contain a reference to, \nbut are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with section 702 targeting procedures are \nunauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed upon recognition.6 \nIII. (U)  RETENTION \nA.  (U) General. Except where indicated below, these retention provisions apply to FISA-\nacquired infonnation the FBI-retains in any fonn. \n1.  (U) Access to FISA-acquired infonnation retained in any form.  The FBI must \nretain all FIS A-acquired information under appropriately secure conditions that limit access to \nsuch information only to individuals who require access in order to perform their official duties \nor assist in a lawful and authorized governmental function.  FBI personnel with access to raw \n(3) may not intentionally target a United States person reasonably believed to be located outside the United \nStates; \n(4) may not intentionally acquire any communication as to which the sender and all intended recipients are \nknown at the time of the acquisition to be located in the United States; \n(5) may not intentionally acquire communications that contain a reference to, but are not to or from a target \nof an acquisition authorized under subsection (a), except as provided under section 103(b) of the FISA \nAmendments Reauthorization Act of2017; and \n(6) shall be conducted in a maMer consistent with the fourth amendment to _the Constitution of the United \nStates.\" \n6 (U) In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked facility is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \nSl3CM3'fh'Pf8f 81tN \n7 \n\n8tgOM1i;t1,rOPOIVf \nFISA-acquired infonnation must receive training on these minimization procedures before \nreceiving access to raw FISA-acquired infonnation. Access to FISA-acquired information \ncontained within different systems shall be appropriately restricted, even when the systems are \n\\ \nnot physically separated.  Such secure conditions and limitations on access may be effected by \nphysical separation, logical partition, or a combination of both. \n2. \n3.  (U)  Any information acquired through the targeting of a person who at the time \nof targeting was reasonably believed to be a non-United States person located outside the United \nStates but is in fact located inside the United States at the time such information is acquired or is \nsubsequently determined to be a United States person will be removed from FBI systems upon \nrecognition, unless the Director or Deputy Director of the FBI specifically detennines in writing \nthat each specific item of acquired infonnation to be retained is reasonably believed to contain \nsignificant foreign intelligence information, evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is \nabout to be committed, or information retained for cryptanalytic, traffic analytic, or signal \nexploitation purposes.  Notwithstanding the above, if any such information indicates that a \nperson targeted under section 702 has entered the United States, nothing in these procedures \nSEOM'.fi1l1,IOFO&\"I \n8 \n\nSlsCRE'f'Jrl'H3F8~i \nshall prevent the FBI from retaining and providing to the National Security Agency (NSA), \nCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA), or National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) technical \ninfonnation derived from such information for collection avoidance purposes. \nB.  (U)  Definitions.  For purposes of these procedures: \n1.  (U)  .. FISA-acquired infonnation\" means all information that the FBI acquires \nfrom an acquisition conducted pursuant to section 702 ofFISA. \n2.  ,s,'/UF) \"Raw FISA-acquired information\" is FISA-acquired information that (a) \nis in the same or substantially same format as when the FBI acquired it, or (b) has been \nprocessed only as necessary to render it into a fonn in which it can be evaluated.  Illustrative \nexamples of raw FIS A-acquired infonnation include audio recordings of intercepted \ncommunications (including copies thereof); soft or hard copies of e-mails \nigital images obtained \nlectronic storage media; verbatim translations of documents or \ncommunications; and intercepted communications that have been processed into the form of \n\"tech cuts\" but have not been evaluated to determine whether the tech cuts reasonably appear to \nbe foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime. Raw FISA-acquired \ninformation, however, does not include infonnation the FB[ has determined, in accordance with \nthese procedures, to reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence infonnation, to be necessary to \nunderstand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a \ncrime. \n3.  (U)  An \"electronic and data storage system\" is any FBI application, program, \ndevice, or process that retains or provides access to raw FISA-acquired information in electronic \nSE@Afirif//Pi 8 F8~i \n9 \n\n9ECRE=t¥Rif 8F8ftN \nfonn and meets the requirements in Sections III.C and 111.D.  An electronic and data storage \nsystem may reside on a server or network or may consist of a single stand-alone terminal or \ndevice.  The FBI shall maintain and make widely available within FBI and to NSD a current list \nof all systems deemed to be electronic and data storage systems. \n4.  (U)  An \"ad hoc system\" is any FBI application, program, device, or process that \ndoes not meet the definition of electronic and data storage system above, that is not governed by \nSection III.F, and that retains or provides access to raw FISA-acquired information.  Ad hoc \nsystems may only be used by FBI personnel who are engaged in or assisting with a particular \ninvestigation and when such FBI personnel have reasonably detennined that for technical, \nanalytical, operational or security reasons they cannot fully, completely, efficiently or securely \nreview or analyze raw FISA-acquired information in an electronic and data storage system.  An \nad hoc system may reside on a server or network or may consist of a single stand-alone terminal \nor device. \n5.  (U) \"Query\" means the use of one or more terms9 to retrieve the unminimized \ncontents or noncontents (including metadata) of section 702-acquired information that is located \nin a covered agency's system.  The term \"query\" does not include a user's query of a system that \ncontains unminimized section 702-acquired information, where the user does not receive \nunminimized section 702-acquired information in response to the query either because the user \nhas not been granted access to the unminimized section 702-acquired information, or because a \nuser who has been granted such access has limited the query such that it cannot retrieve \nunminimized section 702-acquired information. The term \"query\" also does not include (I) a \n9 ~O,:,'! if' Such tenns may include the use of keywords, identifiers, \n--· \nSl!iCU'flrNOFORi', \nIO \n\nsystem user's actions subsequent to conducting a query for purposes of sorting the results of that \nquery based upon the attributes of the infonnation retrieved, 10 or (2) examining or manipulating, \nincluding by technical means, communications or documents for the purpose of minimizing such \ncommunications or documents. 11 \nC.  (U) Additional Provisions Regarding Access, Review, and Use of FISA-Acquired \nInformation \nl.  (U)  Review and use of Fl SA-acquired information retained in any form. \na.  (U) General.  The FBI may make raw FISA-acquired information \navailable to authorized personnel on a continuing basis for review, translation, analysis, and use \nin accordance with these procedures.  Authorized personnel may continue to access raw FISA \nacquired information to determine whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence \ninformation, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its \nimportance, or to be evidence of a crime notwithstanding the fact tbat other FBI personnel \npreviously may have reviewed such information and determined that it did not reasonably appear \nto be foreign intelligence infonnation, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime at the time of sucb review. \n(U)  FBI personnel with authorized access to raw FISA-acquired information may \nreview, translate, copy, transcribe, analyze, summarize, and use all such information only in \naccordance with these procedures and FlSA and only as necessary for the purpose of evaluating \nor determining whether it reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence infonnation or to assess its importance, or to be \n10 (U) For e,cample, the action of a system user to sort the results of a query (i.e., the infonnation actually returned \nto a system user from a query) by date, time, etc. \n11 (U)  For example, an analyst might run a script against a spreadsheet that would find and replace all instances of a \nknown United States person's name with a generic tenn, such a \"U.S. Person I.\" \nSECR:E:r.'/P,OFOR.X \n11 \n\ns@eft@FJWNOPOftP, \nevidence of a crime.  Such personnel shall exercise reasonable judgment in making such \nevaluations or determinations. \n(U)  With respect to information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act, only those \nFBI personnel who have received training on these minimization procedures may be designated \nas case coordinators.  All FBI personnel having access to information acquired pursuant to \nsection 702 of the Act will be infonned of and provided access to these minimization procedures. \nb.  (U)  Information meeting criteria.  Once FBI personnel have assessed that \nraw FISA-acquired information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or to assess its importance, or to be \nevidence of a crime, the FBI may retain that information for further investigation and analysis \nand may disseminate it in accordance with these procedures.  Pursuant to 50 U.S.C. §§ \n1801(h)(3) and 182 l(4)(C), however, information that is assessed to be evidence of a crime but \nnot to be foreign intelligence information or necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation may only be retained and disseminated for law enforcement purposes. \nc.  (U)  United States person identities.  Before using FISA-acquired \ninformation for further investigation, analysis, or dissemination, the FBI shall strike, or substitute \na characterization for, infonnation of or concerning a United States person, including that \nperson's identity, if it does not reasonably appear to be foreign intelligence information, to be \nnecessary to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence information, or to be \nevidence of a crime.  Processing or analyzing FISA-acquired infonnation within an electronic \nand data storage system or ad hoc system does not trigger this requirement.  This requirement is \nalso not triggered by transferring FISA-acquired information between or among electronic and \ndata storage systems, ad hoc systems, collection platforms, or systems used solely for audits and \n8fj€ft>t]if.%1'i8f8Mi \n12 \n\nSE:CRET/fNOFOIH't \noversight.  However, when FBI transfers or copies FISA-acquired infonnation from an electronic \nand data storage system, ad hoc system, or system used for transitory retention onto a medium, \ndevice, or system that is not an electronic and data storage system or ad hoc system a<.; defined by \nthese procedures, any information of or concerning a U.S. person, including that person's \nidentity, that is being transferred that does not meet the retention standard (i.e., reasonably \nappears to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, or to be evidence of a crime) must be stricken or a \nsubstitution made prior to the transfer. \nd.  (U)  Disclosure and dissemination. The FBI may disclose or disseminate \ncopies, transcriptions, summaries, and other documents containing FISA-acquired information \nonly in accordance with the disclosure and dissemination procedures set forth in Section IV \nbelow. \ne.  (U) Exculpatory, impeachment, and discoverable material.  The FBI shall \nretain FJSA-acquired information that is not foreign intelligence information that has been \nreviewed and reasonably appears to be exculpatory or impeachment material for a criminal \nproceeding, or reasonably appears to be discoverable in a criminal proceeding, and shall treat \nthat information as if it were evidence of a crime. \nf.  (U) Sensitive information.  Particular care should be ta.ken when \nreviewing information that is sensitive information, as defined below.  No sensitive information \nmay be used in an analysis or report (such as an Electronic Communication (EC)) unless it is \nfirst detennined that such information reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, \nnecessary to understand foreign intelligence information or assess its importance, or evidence of \na crime.  lnfonnation that reasonably appears to be foreign intelligence information, necessary to \n13 \n\n8:13€Rf3'fh'N8f8RM \nunderstand foreign intelligence information, or necessary to assess the importance of foreign \nintelligence information may be retained, processed, and disseminated in accordance with these \nprocedures even if it is sensitive information.  Information that reasonably appears to be \nevidence of a crime may be retained, processed, and disseminated for law enforcement purposes \nin accordance with these procedures, even if it is sensitive infonnation.  Sensitive information \nconsists of: \n(a)  Religious activities of United States persons, including consultations with clergy; \n(b)  Educational and academic activities of United States persons, including \nconsultations among professors or other teachers and their students; \n(c)  Political activities of United States persons, including discussions with Members \nof Congress and their staff, and other elected officials; \n(d)  Activities of United States persons involving the press and other media; \n(e)  Sexual and other highly personal activities of United States persons; \n(t)  Medical, psychiatric, or psychotherapeutic activities of United States persons; and · \n(g)  Matters pertaining to United States minor children, including student requests for \ninformation to aid in academic endeavors. \n2.

Thereafter, the FBI shall provide any new policies or materially modified policies to the \nCourt on a semiannual basis. \nD.  (U) Electronic and Data Storage Systems \nl.  (U) Access to information and auditing requirement.  The FBI shall maintain \naccurate records of all persons who have accessed FISA-acquired infonnation in electronic and \ndata storage systems and audit its access records regularly to ensure that FISA-acquired \ninfonnation is only accessed by authorized individuals, including FB[ personnel and the \nindividuals referenced in Sections 111.H.4 and V.A of these procedures. \n2.  (U)  Marking. The FBI shall require the primary case agent(s) and his/her/their \ndesignees (hereinafter \"case coordinator(s)\") to control the marking of raw FISA-acquired \ninformation in a particular case that is maintained in an electronic and data storage system.  A \nmarking, for example, would include an indication th.at the information is foreign intelligence \ninformation. The FBI shall identify FISA-acquired information in electronic and data storage \nsystems that has been reviewed and whether that information has been determined to reasonably \nappear to be foreign intelligence information, to be necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or to assess its importance; or to be evidence of a crime. \nS:l!.:CREIJJl◄OFORn \n15 \n\n8@@Mli';lfttOFOtlN \n3.

The FBI conducts user activity monitoring \n(\"UAM\") activities, which are activities designed to provide the FBI with the technical capability \nto observe and record the actions and activities of a user on an FBI device or network in order to \ndetect insider threats and support authorized investigations of such users.  Insofar as FBl's UAM \nactivities capture records that contain raw section 702-acquired information, such information \nmay be contained in an FBI system or other repository provided that the retention of such \ninformation is in furtherance of an authorized use specified in this paragraph.  Records captured \nby FBI's UAM activities that contain raw section 702-acquired information shall not be subject \nto the requirements of sections IU.C, 111.D, 111.E, 111.F.4, and IIl.1.3-4 of these procedures. \nAccess to records captured by FBl's UAM activities that contain raw section 702-acquired \ninfonnation shall be limited to FBI personnel who require access to perform their official duties \nrelated to an authorized use specified in this paragraph, \nny personnel with access to records captured by FBI's UAM \nactivities that contain raw section 702-acquired information must receive training on these \nprocedures.  FBI personnel who have access to records captured by FBI's UAM activities that \ncontain raw section 702-acquired infonnation may use such records to also assist in insider threat \ninquiries or investigations; security inquires and investigations regarding the eligibility of FBI \npersonnel to access classified information or hold a sensitive position; counterintelligence \ninquiries and investigations, \nSE!CIMJiifh:Pi/OPOllff \n32 \n\n8ECR£1WNOFOAN \nThe FBI \nshall maintain records of all personnel who have access to records captured by FBl's UAM \nactivities that contain raw section 702-acquired information. Any dissemination of records \ncaptured by FBl's UAM activities that contain raw section 702-acquired information must be \nmade in accordance with the dissemination requirements in these procedures. \n(S)JfQf)  In the event that the FBI recognizes a record captured by FBI's UAM activities \nthat contains section 702-acquired information and such information meets the retention \nrequirement(s) in these procedures and it is not otherwise subject to purge, the FBI may retain \nsuch record.  If the FBI determines that the record does not otherwise meet the criteria for \nretention, it will delete the record unless it is necessary to retain in furtherance of an authorized \nuse specified in this paragraph.  In the event the FBI retains a record that contains section 702-\nacquired information that does not meet the applicable retention standard or is otherwise subject \nto purge, the government shaJl report such retention in its next quarterly report concerning \ncompliance matters under section 702 and include the reason why it is necessary to retain the \ninformation in furtherance of an authorized use specified in this paragraph.  Once the FBI \ndetermines that it is no longer necessary to retain the section 702-acquired information in \nfurtherance of an authorized use specified in this paragraph, the information shaJI be destroyed to \nthe extent required by the applicable provisions of these procedures or other requirements. \n8.

(U) As used herein, the tenns \"Attorney General,\" 0foreign power,\" \"agent of a foreign·-' \npower,° '1United States person,\" \"person,\" 11foreign intelligence information,\" \n\"international terrorism,\" and \"sabotage11 have the meanings specified in sections 101 and \n701 of the Act. \nb.  (U) The tenn 11United States person identity\" means (1) the name, unique title, or address \nof a United States person; or (2) other personal identifiers of a United States person when \nappearing in the context of activities conducted by that person or activities conducted by \nothers that are related to that person.  A reference to a product by brand name or \nmanufacturer's name; or the use of a name in a descriptive sense, e.g., \"Monroe \nDoctrine,\" is not a United States person identity. \nc.  (U) For purposes of these procedures, the terms \"Central Intelligence Agency,\" \"CIA,\" \nand \"CIA personnel\" refer to any employees of CIA and any other personnel acting under \nthe direction, authority, or control of the Director of the CIA, as well as to employees of \nother U.S. Government agencies who are physically located at CIA and who are granted \naccess to CIA systems to perfonn duties in support of CIA operations, but who retain the \nauthorities and responsibilities of their parent organization.  Such personnel must \nspecifically agree to: comply with these minimization procedures; comply with all CIA \ndirection on the handling of information acquired under section 702; and not make any \nuse of, share, or otherwise disseminate any information acquired pursuant to section 702 \nwithout specific CIA approval. \nSECRET/INOFORN \nClassified by:  The Deputy Attorney General \nDerived from:  DOJ/NSI SCG 1 INT dated 20120701, 1.6 \nI  I \nFILED UNDER SEAL  Declassify on:  20461018 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nd.  (U)  The following guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is \nunknown is a United States person: \n(1) (U)  A person known to be located in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless the person is identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence, or the circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such \nperson is not a United States person. \n(2) (U)  A person known to be located outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will be treated as a non-United States person unless the person is identified \nas a United States person or the circumstances give rise to the reasonable belief that \nsuch person is a United States person. \n(3) (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the CIA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nCIA Office of General Counsel and the National Security Division (NSD) of the \nDepartment of Justice. \n(4) (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \n2.  (U)  Unminimized information acquired in accordance with section 702 of the Act and \nreceived by CIA will be maintained in access-controlled repositories that are accessible only \nto those who have completed the required training and are physically or logically separated \nfrom repositories with general access. \na.  (U)  Unminimized information that may contain United States person information \nthat does not otherwise qualify for retention under paragraphs 3, 6, or 8 of these \nprocedures may be retained in such access-controlled repositories for no longer than \nfive years from the expiration date of the certification authorizing the collection \nunless the Deputy Director of the CIA for Operations (ODO), or one of his or her \nsuperiors, determines that an extension is necessary because the information is \nreasonably believed to contain significant foreign intelligence information, or \nevidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to be committed.  An extension \nunder this paragraph may apply to a specific category of information, and must be \ndocumented in writing, renewed on an annual basis, and promptly reported to the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and NSD, which will promptly \nnotify the FISC in writing of all such determinations. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n2 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nb.  (U)  Any communications acquired pursuant to section 702 that contain a reference \nto, but are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with section 702 targeting \nprocedures are unauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed upon \nrecognition. 1 \n3.  (U)  Information from a communication to which a United States person is a party may be \nretained by CIA indefinitely if the information meets the standard for retention under this \nparagraph.  In any communication, information concerning a United States person may be \nretained by CIA indefinitely if the United States person identity is deleted or otherwise \nsanitized to prevent the search, retrieval, or review of the identifying information (a generic \nterm may be substituted which does not identify the United States person in the context of the \ndata).  If the information cannot be sanitized in such a fashion because the United States \nperson identity is necessary, or it is reasonably believed that it may become necessary, to \nunderstand or assess the information, CIA may retain that information and the United States \nperson identity indefinitely if: \na.  (U)  The information is foreign intelligence information.  Such information includes, but \nis not limited to, information falling within one or more of the following categories: \n(1) (U)  the information indicates that the United States person has acted or may be \nacting as an agent of a foreign power, including information indicating that a United \nStates person was in contact with a foreign power under facts and circumstances \nindicating that he intends to collaborate with a foreign power or become an agent of a \nforeign power; \n(2) (U)  the information indicates that a United States person may be a target of \nintelligence activities of a foreign power; or \n(3) (U)  the information indicates that a United States person has engaged or may be \nengaging in the unauthorized disclosure of properly classified national security \ninformation; \nb.  (U)  The information concerns corporations or other commercial organizations the \ndeletion of which would hamper the correlation of foreign intelligence information on the \nsame subject; \nc.  (U)  The information is enciphered or contains secret meaning; \nd.  (U)  The information is needed to protect the safety of any persons or organizations, \nincluding those who are targets, victims, or hostages of groups engaged in international \nterrorism; \n1 (U) In applying this provision, note that any user ofa tasked selector is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n3 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \ne.  (U)  The information concerns a United States person who is or reasonably appears to be, \non the basis of that or other information, an agent of a foreign power; \nf.  (U)  The information indicates that a United States person is engaged or may be engaged \nin international terrorism or activities in preparation therefor; \ng.  (U)  The information is needed and retained solely to identify individuals in contact with \na foreign power or an agent of a foreign power (including for purposes of this \nsubparagraph (g) any person, regardless of location, who engages in international \nterrorism or activities in preparation therefor; who aids, abets, or conspires with persons \nto engage in such activities; or who acts as a member of a group engaged in such \nactivities); \nh.   \n \n \n1.  (U)  The information concerns a person or activity that poses a threat of sabotage, \ninternational terrorism, actual or potential attack or other grave hostile act, to any facility \nor personnel of any agency within the U.S. Intelligence Community, or any department \ncontaining such an agency; \nJ.  (U)  The information indicates that a United States person may be a target of intelligence \nactivities of a foreign power; or \nk.  (U)  The information concerns a U.S. Government official acting in an official capacity. \n4.  (U)  Queries of unminimized content or noncontent information acquired in accordance with \nsection 702 of the Act are governed by the \"Querying Procedures Used by the Central \nIntelligence Agency in Connection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence Information \nPursuant to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as Amended.\" \nAll such queries conducted by CIA personnel must be made in accordance with those \nprocedures.  Authorized CIA users with access to unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation should process the results of such queries in accordance with these minimization \nprocedures. \n5.  (U)  In addition, CIA will follow the following procedures: \na.  (U)  Nothing in these procedures authorizes the dissemination of non-publicly available \ninformation that identifies any United States person without such person's consent \nunless:  (1) such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance; (2) the information is foreign intelligence \ninformation as defined in 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(l); or (3) the information is evidence of a \ncrime which has been, is being, or is about to be committed and that is to be disseminated \nfor law enforcement purposes. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n4 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nb.  (U)  Any information retained pursuant to paragraph 3 above may be disseminated to \notherwise authorized recipients outside of CIA if the identity of the United States person \nand all personally identifiable information regarding the United States person are deleted \nor otherwise sanitized to prevent the search, retrieval, or review of the identifying \ninformation. A generic term may be substituted which does not identify the United States \nperson in the context of the data.  However, if the information cannot be sanitized in such \na manner because such person's identity is necessary to understand foreign intelligence \ninformation or assess its importance, that identity may be disseminated outside of CIA \nwithout such person's consent.  Additionally, if the information cannot be sanitized in \nsuch in a manner because it is reasonably believed that such person's identity may \nbecome necessary to understand or assess the importance of foreign intelligence \ninformation as defined by 50 U.S.C. § 1801(e)(l), that identity may be disseminated \noutside of CIA without such person's consent. \n6.  (U)  Nothing in these procedures shall prohibit:2 \na.  (U)  The retention or disclosure of information necessary for the purpose of determining \nwhether the requirements of these procedures are satisfied, provided that the recipient \nunder this paragraph does not retain or disclose the identity of a United States person \nwhere it is determined that the requirements of these procedures do not permit \ndissemination; \nb.  (U)  The retention or dissemination of information concerning corporations or other \ncommercial organizations which is limited to their identities as manufacturers of \nequipment and related nomenclature or their locations; \nc.  (U)  The retention or dissemination of information required by law to be retained or \ndisseminated; \nd.  (U)  The retention or processing of communications in emergency data backup systems, \nprovided that only administrative, collection, or technical personnel have access to such \nsystems.  In the event that information from such systems must be used to restore lost, \ndestroyed, or inaccessible data, CIA shall apply these procedures to the transferred data; \ne.  (U)  The performance of lawful oversight functions of the NSD and ODNI, or the \napplicable Offices of the Inspectors General, or the provision by CIA of the assistance \nnecessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions; \nf.  (U) CIA's activities necessary to create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of its \nsystems that process or store section 702-acquired information; \n2 (U)  Whenever relying on any portion of this provision to deviate from any provision of these minimization \nprocedures, CIA personnel shall limit the scope of their deviation and comport with all other provisions of these \nminimization procedures to the maximum extent practicable. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n5 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \ng.  (U)  The retention, processing, analysis, or dissemination of information necessary to \ncomply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific congressional \nmandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with congressional oversight. \nh.  (U) CIA's activities necessary to perfonn the following lawful oversight functions of its \npersonnel or systems: \n(a)  (U)  investigate and remediate possible FISA compliance incidents; or \n(b)  (U)  identify section 702-acquired information subject to destruction, \nincluding under these minimization procedures. \n(U)  Should CIA determine it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these procedures \nto perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart from those \ndescribed in this subparagraph, CIA shall consult with NSD and ODNI prior to \nconducting such an activity.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).  Each such report shall describe the nature of the \ndeviation from the procedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the \ndeviation was necessary.  Once section 702-acquired information is no longer reasonably \nbelieved to be necessary for a lawful oversight function, the information shall be \ndestroyed to the extent required by the applicable provisions of these procedures. \n1.  (U)  Notwithstanding any other provision in these procedures, CIA may conduct \nvulnerability assessments using information acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act \nin order to ensure that CIA systems have not been compromised.  The information used \nby CIA may be retained for a period not to exceed one year solely for that limited \npurpose.  Any information retained for this purpose may be disseminated only in \naccordance with the applicable provisions of these procedures.  While retained in \ndatabases for vulnerability assessments, the section 702-acquired information may not be \naccessed for any other purpose. \n7.  (U)  CIA will also follow the following procedures: \na.  (U)  Privileged Communications.  CIA may receive unminimized communications, \nacquired pursuant to section 702 ofFISA, to which an attorney is a party.  These \nprovisions address the retention, dissemination, and use of information in such \ncommunications and apply when CIA personnel processing a communication acquired \npursuant to section 702 of FISA determine (based on the information in the \ncommunication or other information of which the CIA processing personnel are aware) \nthat the communication is between an attorney ( or any person who, based on the \ninformation in the communication, appears clearly to be communicating on behalf of an \nattorney, such as a paralegal or administrative assistant) and a client. \n( 1) (U)  After discovering such a communication, if CIA personnel processing a \ncommunication make an affirmative determination that the communication does not \ncontain foreign intelligence infonnation or evidence of a crime, the communication \nmust be destroyed irrespective of whether the communication contains information \nprotected by the attorney-client privilege. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n6 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(2) (U)  If CIA personnel processing such a communication determine that the \ncommunication appears to contain foreign intelligence information or evidence of a \ncrime, the personnel processing the communication must bring the communication to \nthe attention of CIA's Office of General Counsel for action as set forth below. \n(3) (S//NF)  Privileged Communications Pertaining to a Criminal Charge in the United \nStates.  \n \n \n \n \n  If the \ncommunication contains privileged information pertaining to a criminal charge in the \nUnited States, the communication shall be segregated. \n( 4)   \n \n \n(5)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(6)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(7) (S//NF)   dissemination of attorney \nclient privileged information   \noutside CIA shall be limited to the greatest extent practicable, accompanied by \nappropriate handling controls, and shall include  language advising recipients (1) that \nthe report contains information obtained from communications that may be subject to \nthe attorney-client privilege, (2) that use of the information is provided for \nSECRET//NOFORN \n7 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nintelligence purposes only and may not be used in any trial, hearing, or other \nproceeding absent express approval by the Attorney General, and (3) that further \ndissemination is prohibited absent express approval of the Assistant Attorney General \nfor National Security or his or her designee.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  CIA shall keep a record of all disseminations outside CIA of \nattorney-client privileged information of the type described in subparagraphs 3 and 5 \nabove. \nb.  (U)  Disclosure to Other Federal Agencies for Technical or Linguistic Assistance.  It is \nanticipated that CIA may obtain from NSA and FBI unminimized information or \ncommunications that, because of their technical or linguistic content, may require further \nanalysis by other federal agencies of the U.S. Government (collectively \"assisting federal \nagencies\") to assist CIA in determining their meaning or significance.  Notwithstanding \nother provisions of these minimization procedures, CIA may disclose computer disks, \ntape recordings, transcripts, or other information or items containing unminimized \ninformation or communications acquired by NSA or FBI pursuant to section 702 of the \nAct to assisting federal agencies for further processing and analysis, provided that the \nfollowing restrictions apply with respect to any materials so disclosed: \n(I) (U)  Disclosure to assisting federal agencies will be solely for translation or analysis \nof such information or communications, and assisting federal agencies will make no \nuse of any information or any communication of or concerning any person except to \nprovide technical assistance to CIA. \n(2) (U)  Disclosure will be only to those personnel within assisting federal agencies \ninvolved in the translation or analysis of such information or communications.  The \nnumber of such personnel will be restricted to the extent feasible.  There will be no \nfurther disclosure within assisting federal agencies of this raw data. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n8 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(3) (U)  Assisting federal agencies will make no permanent agency record of information \nor communications of or concerning any person referred to or recorded on computer \ndisks, tape recordings, transcripts, or other items disclosed by CIA to assisting federal \nagencies, provided that assisting federal agencies may maintain such temporary \nrecords as are necessary to enable them to assist CIA with the translation or analysis \nof such information.  Records maintained by assisting federal agencies for this \npurpose may not be disclosed within the assisting federal agency, except to personnel \ninvolved in providing technical assistance to CIA. \n(4 ) (U)  Upon the conclusion of such technical assistance to CIA, computer disks, tape \nrecordings, transcripts, or other items or information disclosed to assisting federal \nagencies will either be returned to CIA or be destroyed with an accounting of such \ndestruction made to CIA. \nc.  (U)  Dissemination and Disclosure to Foreign Governments.  CIA may disseminate \nnonpublicly available identity or personally identifiable information concerning United \nStates persons to foreign governments provided that such information is foreign \nintelligence information and either (i) the Attorney General approves the dissemination; \nor (ii) CIA disseminates the information under procedures that have been approved by the \nAttorney General.  In addition, CIA may disseminate such foreign intelligence \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 of the Act to the extent authorized by the \nDirector of the CIA, and in accordance with Director of National Intelligence Intelligence \nCommunity directives.  CIA may make such disseminations without specific Attorney \nGeneral approval, and may make disclosures to foreign governments, subject to the \nfollowing procedures: \n(1)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCIA will undertake reasonable steps to ensure that the \ndisseminated information will be used in a manner consistent with United States law, \nincluding Executive Order No. 12333 and applicable federal criminal statutes. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n9 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(3)  (U)  Procedures for technical or linguistic assistance.  It is anticipated that CIA may \nobtain from NSA and FBI unminimized information or communications that, because \nof their technical or linguistic content, may require further analysis by foreign  . \ngovernments (collectively \"assisting foreign governments\") to assist CIA in \ndetermining their meaning or significance.  Notwithstanding other provisions of these \nminimization procedures, CIA may disclose computer disks, tape recordings, \ntranscripts, or other information or items containing unminimized information or \ncommunications acquired by NSA or FBI pursuant to section 702 of the Act to \nassisting foreign governments for further processing and analysis, provided that the \nfollowing restrictions apply with respect to any materials so disclosed: \n(a)  (U)  Disclosure to assisting foreign governments will be solely for translation or \nanalysis of such information or communications, and assisting foreign \ngovernments will make no use of any information or any communication of or \nconcerning any person except to provide technical assistance to CIA. \n(b)  (U)  Disclosure will be only to those personnel within assisting foreign \ngovernments involved in the translation or analysis of such information or \ncommunications.  The number of such personnel will be restricted to the extent \nfeasible.  There will be no further disclosure within assisting foreign governments \nof this raw data. \n( c)  (U)  Assisting foreign governments will make no permanent agency record of \ninformation or communications of or concerning any person referred to or \nrecorded on computer disks, tape recordings, transcripts, or other items disclosed \nby CIA to assisting foreign governments, provided that assisting foreign \ngovernments may maintain such temporary records as are necessary to enable \nthem to assist CIA with the translation or analysis of such information.  Records \nmaintained by assisting foreign governments for this purpose may not be \ndisclosed within the assisting foreign government, except to personnel involved in \nproviding technical assistance to CIA. \n(d)  (U)  Upon the conclusion of such technical assistance to CIA, computer disks, \ntape recordings, transcripts, or other items or information disclosed to assisting \nforeign governments will either be returned to CIA or be destroyed with an \naccounting of such destruction made to CIA. \n( e)  (U)  Any information that assisting foreign governments provide to CIA as a \nresult of such technical assistance may be disseminated by CIA in accordance \nwith these minimization procedures. \n(4 ) (U)  CIA will make a written record of each dissemination and disclosure approved \npursuant to these procedures, and information regarding such disseminations and \ndisclosures and approvals will be made available for review by the Department of \nJustice. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n10 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \nd.  (U)  Compliance With Crimes Reporting Obligations. Notwithstanding other provisions \nof these minimization procedures, information that is not foreign intelligence \ninformation, but reasonably appears to be evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or \nis about to be committed, may be retained and disseminated (including United States \nperson identities) to the FBI and other appropriate federal law enforcement authorities, in \naccordance with 50 U.S.C. §§ 1806(b) and 1825(c), Executive Order No. 12333, and, \nwhere applicable, the crimes reporting procedures set out in the August 1995 \n\"Memorandum of Understanding: Reporting oflnformation Concerning Federal Crimes,\" \nor any successor document. \ne.  (S//NF)  Procedures for User Activity Monitoring Systems.  CIA's user activity \nmonitoring (UAM) involves the monitoring   of individual user activity on \nGovernment information systems (i.e., networks and devices).  CIA's UAM efforts are \ndesigned to protect against insider threats and ensure that Government information \nsystems remain secure, and sensitive information that is transmitted, stored, or processed \non those systems is not used for unauthorized purposes.  Insofar as CIA's UAM activities \ncapture records that contain unminimized section 702-acquired information, such \ninformation may be retained in CIA systems used solely for storing UAM data (\"UAM \nsystems\") provided that the retention of such information is for the purpose of UAM. \nAccess to records containing unminimized section 702-acquired information in UAM \nsystems shall be limited to CIA personnel who require access to perform their official \nduties related to UAM,   \n  Any personnel with access to UAM systems must receive training on these \nprocedures.   \n \n  CIA shall maintain records of all personnel who have access to UAM \nsystems.  Any dissemination of records that contain section 702-acquired information \nfrom UAM systems must be made in accordance with the dissemination requirements in \nthese procedures.   \n  In the event that CIA recognizes \nsection 702-acquired information in a record stored in a UAM system and such \ninformation meets the retention requirement(s) in these procedures and is not otherwise \nidentifiable as being subject to purge, CIA may retain that information indefinitely.  If \nCIA determines that the information does not meet the criteria for indefinite retention or \nis otherwise subject to purge, it will delete the information unless it is necessary to retain \nfor UAM purposes.  In the event CIA retains section 702-acquired information under this \nparagraph that does not meet the applicable retention standard or is identified as being \nsubject to purge, CIA will notify NSD and ODNI.  NSD shall report such retention in its \nnext quarterly report concerning compliance matters under section 702 and include the \nreason retention of the information in that system is necessary for UAM purposes.  Once \nCIA determines that it is no longer necessary to retain the section 702-acquired \ninformation for UAM purposes, the information shall be destroyed to the extent required \nby the applicable provisions of these procedures or other requirements. \n8.  (U)  Any information received by CIA that is acquired through the targeting of a person who \nat the time of targeting was reasonably believed to be a non-United States person located \nSECRET//NOFORN \n11 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \noutside the United States but is in fact located inside the United States at the time such \ninformation is acquired or was in fact a United States person at the time of targeting will be \ndestroyed unless the Director of the CIA specifically determines in writing that each specific \nitem of acquired information to be retained is reasonably believed to contain significant \nforeign intelligence information or evidence of a crime that has been, is being, or is about to \nbe committed. \n9.  (S//NF)  In the event that CIA seeks to use any information acquired pursuant to section 702 \nduring a time period when there is uncertainty about the location of the target of the \nacquisition because   post-tasking checks described in NSA's section 702 \ntargeting procedures were not functioning properly, CIA will follow its internal procedures \nfor determining whether such information may be used (including, but not limited to, in FISA \napplications, section 702 targeting, and disseminations).  Except as necessary to assess \nlocation under this provision, CIA may not use or disclose any information acquired pursuant \nto section 702 during such time period unless CIA determines, based on the totality of the \ncircumstances, that the target is reasonably believed to have been located outside the United \nStates at the time the information was acquired.  If CIA determines that the target is \nreasonably believed to have been located inside the United States at the time the information \nwas acquired, such information will not be used and will be promptly destroyed. \n10. (U)  If CIA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these minimization \nprocedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life and that it is not feasible to \nobtain a timely modification of these procedures, CIA may take such action immediately. \nCIA will report the action taken to the ODNI and NSD, which will promptly notify the FISC \nof such activity. \n11. (U)  In addition, CIA will follow the following procedures: \na.  (U)  Notwithstanding the destruction requirements set forth in these minimization \nprocedures, CIA may retain specific section 702-acquired information if the Department \nof Justice advises CIA in writing that such information is subject to a preservation \nobligation in pending or anticipated administrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  The \nDepartment of Justice will identify in writing the specific information to be retained \n(including, but not limited to, the target(s) or selector(s) whose information must be \npreserved and the relevant time period at issue in the litigation), and the particular \nlitigation for which the information will be retained.  In order to restrict access to \ninformation being retained pursuant to this provision, personnel not working on the \nparticular litigation matter shall not access the section 702-acquired information \npreserved pursuant to a written preservation notice from the Department of Justice that \nwould otherwise have been destroyed pursuant to these procedures.  Other personnel \nshall only access the information being retained for litigation-related reasons on a case \nby-case basis after consultation with the Department of Justice.  The Department of \nJustice shall notify CIA in writing once the section 702-acquired information is no longer \nrequired to be preserved for such litigation matters, and then CIA shall promptly destroy \nthe section 702-acquired information as otherwise required by these procedures. \nSECRET//NOFORN \n12 \n\nSECRET//NOFORN \n(1) (U)  Each year, CIA will provide NSD with a summary of: (a) all administrative, \ncivil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of section 702-acquired \ndata that would otherwise be subject to age off pursuant to paragraph 2, (b) a \ndescription of the section 702-acquired infonnation preserved for each such litigation \nmatter, and (c) if possible based on the infonnation available to CIA, a description of \nthe status of each such litigation matter. \n(2) (U)  In certain circumstances, CIA may receive written notice from the Department of \nJustice advising CIA to preserve section 702-acquired information that would \notherwise be subject to a destruction requirement under paragraphs 7, 8, or 9.  CIA \nwill promptly provide NSD with a summary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or \ncriminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of section 702-acquired \ninformation that would otherwise be subject to destruction pursuant to paragraphs 7, \n8, or 9, (b) a description of the section 702-acquired information preserved for each \nsuch litigation matter, and (c) if possible based on the infonnation available to CIA, a \ndescription of the status of each such litigation matter.  When such circumstances \narise, NSD will promptly notify the FISC. \nb.  (U)  The Department of Justice may advise CIA to retain specific section 702-acquired \ninformation subject to a destruction requirement other than those specified above in this \nparagraph because such information is subject to a preservation obligation in pending or \nanticipated administrative, civil, or criminal litigation.  CIA will provide NSD with a \nsummary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating \npreservation of section 702-acquired information that would otherwise be subject to \ndestruction, (b) a description of the section 702-acquired information preserved for each \nsuch litigation matter, and (c ) if possible, based on the information available to CIA, a \ndescription of the status of each such litigation matter.  NSD will promptly notify and \nsubsequently request authorization from the FISC to retain the material as appropriate \nand consistent with law.  CIA will restrict access to and retain such information, in the \nmanner described in subparagraph 11 (a), at the direction of the Department of Justice \nuntil either the FISC denies the request for authorization to retain the information or the \nDepartment of Justice notifies CIA in writing that the information is no longer required to \nbe preserved for such litigation matters.  After receiving such notice, CIA shall promptly \ndestroy the section 702-acquired information. \nMONACO \nLISA 0. \nDeputy Attorney General of the United States \nSECRET//NOFORN \n13 ",

These minimization procedures apply in addition to \nseparate querying procedures adopted pursuant to subsection 702( f)( l ) of the Act.  These \nminimization procedures should be read and applied in conjunction with those querying \nprocedures, and nothing in these procedures permits any actions that would otherwise be \nprohibited by those querying procedures. \n(U)  If NSA determines that it must take action in apparent departure from these \nminimization procedures to protect against an immediate threat to human life (e.g., force \nprotection or hostage situations) and that it is not feasible to obtain a timely modification of \nthese procedures, NSA may take such action immediately.  NSA will report the action taken \nto the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (0DNI) and to the National Security \nDivision of the Department of Justice (NSD), which will promptly notify the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) of such activity. \n(U) For the purposes of these procedures, the terms \"National Security Agency\" and \"NSA \npersonnel\" refer to any employees of the National Security Agency/Central Security Service \n(\"NSA/CSS\" or 'NSA\") and any other personnel engaged in Signals Intelligence (SIGI NT) \noperations authorized pursuant to section 702 of the Act if such operations are executed \nunder the direction, authority, or control of the Director, NSA/Chief, CSS (DIRNSA). \n(U) Section 2 -Exceptions, Oversight, and Training \n(a)  (U) NSA will conduct oversight (to include compliance) activities on an ongoing basis, \nwith respect to its exercise of the authority under section 702 of the Act, including the \ntargeting, minimization, and querying procedures adopted in accordance with section \n702.  NSA will develop and deliver training regarding the applicable procedures to ensure \nNSA personnel responsible for approving the targeting of persons for acquisition under \nsection 702, as well as NSA personnel with access to information thereby acquired, \nunderstand their responsibilities and the applicable procedures that apply to this \nacquisition. NSA will make any necessary reports, including those relating to incidents \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \nClassified by:  The Assistant Attorney General for National Security \nDerived From: NSA/CSSM 1-52 (dated 201801 IO) \nI  FILED UNDER SEAL I  Declassify On: 20480313 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \nof noncompliance, to the NSA Inspector General and NSA Office of General Counsel, in \naccordance with its NSA charter.  NSA will also ensure that necessary corrective actions \nare taken to address any identified deficiencies. \n(b)  (U)  Nothing in these procedures shall restrict: \n(1) (U) the performance of lawful oversight functions ofNSD or ODNI, or the applicable \nOffices of the Inspectors General, or the provision by NSA of the assistance \nnecessary for these entities to perform their lawful oversight functions; \n(2) (U) activities necessary to create, test, or conduct technical maintenance of NSA \nsystems that process or store section 702-acquired information; \n(3)  (U) the retention, processing, analysis, or dissemination of information necessary to \ncomply with an order of a court within the United States or a specific congressional \nmandate, such as a subpoena or similar process consistent with congressional \noversight; \n( 4)  (U) NSA' s ability to conduct vulnerability or network assessments using information \nacquired pursuant to section 702 in order to ensure that NSA systems are not or have \nnot been compromised.  Notwithstanding any other section in these procedures, \ninformation used by NSA to conduct vulnerability or network assessments may be \nretained for one year solely for that limited purpose.  Any information retained for \nthis purpose may be disseminated only in accordance with the applicable provisions \nof these procedures; \n(5)  (U) activities necessary to perform the following lawful oversight functions of NSA's \npersonnel or systems: \na.  (U)  investigate and remediate possible section 702 compliance incidents; \nb.  (U)  identify section 702-acquired information subject to destruction, \nincluding under these minimization procedures; or \nc.  (U)  review, approve, or audit queries of section 702-acquired information. \n(U) Should NSA determine it is necessary to deviate from an aspect of these \nprocedures to perform lawful oversight functions of its personnel or systems apart \nfrom those described in this subsection (2.b.5), NSA shall consult with NSD and \nODNI prior to conducting such an activity.  NSD shall promptly report the deviation \nto the FISC.  Each such report shall describe the nature of the deviation from the \nprocedures and identify the specific oversight activity for which the deviation was \nnecessary.  Once section 702-acquired information is no longer reasonably believed \nto be necessary for a lawful oversight function, the information shall be destroyed to \nthe extent required by the applicable provisions of these procedures. \n( c) (U) NSA has established internal procedures for ensuring that raw traffic is labeled and \nstored only in authorized repositories, and is accessible only to those who have had the \nproper training.  NSA personnel who are undergoing, but have not yet completed, \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n2 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \ntraining regarding the proper implementation of section 702 and NSA' s section 702 \nprocedures may have access to raw section 702-acquired information during the conduct \nof such training and insofar as reasonably necessary to be effective. \n(U) Whenever relying on any portion of the exceptions in this or the preceding subsection \n(2.b or 2.c) to deviate from any other provision of these minimization procedures, NSA \npersonnel shall limit the scope of their deviation and comport with all other provisions of \nthese minimization procedures to.the maximum extent practicable. \n(U)  Section 3 -Definitions \n(U)  In addition to the definitions in sections 101 and 701 of the Act, the following \ndefinitions will apply to these procedures: \n(a) (S//NF)  Acquisition means the collection by NSA or the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n(FBI) through electronic means of a non-public communication to which it is not an \nintended party\n(b) (U)  Communications concerning a United States person include all communications in \nwhich a United States person is discussed or mentioned, except where such \ncommunications reveal only publicly available information about the person. \n( c) (U)  Communications of a United States person include all communications to which a \nUnited States person is a party. \n(d) (TS//SI//NF)  For purposes of these procedures,   \n \n \n \n \n( e) (U)  Consent is the agreement by a person or organization to permit the NSA to take \nparticular actions that affect the person or organization.  To be effective, consent must be \ngiven by the affected person or organization with sufficient knowledge to understand the \naction that may be taken.  Consent by an organization will be deemed valid if given on \nbehalf of the organization by an official or governing body determined by the General \nCounsel, NSA, to have actual or apparent authority to make such an agreement. \n(f)  (U)  Foreign communication means a communication that has at least one communicant \noutside of the United States.  All other communications, including communications in \nwhich the sender and all intended recipients are reasonably believed to be located in the \nUnited States at the time of acquisition, are domestic communications. \n(g) (U)  Identification of a United States person means (1) the name, unique title, or address \nof a United States person; or (2) other personal identifiers of a United States person when \nappearing in the context of activities conducted by that person or activities conducted by \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n3 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \nothers that are related to that person.  A reference to a product by brand name, or \nmanufacturer's name or the use of a name in a descriptive sense, e.g., \"Monroe Doctrine,\" \nis not an identification of a United States person. \n(h) (TS//SI//NF)  Internet transaction, for purposes of these procedures, means an Internet \ncommunication that is acquired through NSA's upstream collection techniques.  An \nInternet transaction may contain information or data representing either a discrete \ncommunication (e.g., an e-mail message) or multiple discrete communications\n \n(i)  (U)  Process or processing means any action necessary to convert unminimized section \n702-acquired information into an intelligible form or any machine-initiated action \ndesigned to identify, curate, label, or organize such information; provided, however, that \nthe term \"process\" or \"processing\" does not include an action that: (1) presents \ninformation for human inspection; or (2) using means that do not involve human \ninspection, produces and makes affirmative use of information for investigative, \nintelligence analysis, or preventative purposes. \n(j)  (U)  Publicly available information means information that a member of the public could \nobtain on request, by research in public sources, or by casual observation. \n(k) (U)  United States person means a United States person as defined in the Act.  The \nfollowing guidelines apply in determining whether a person whose status is unknown is a \nUnited States person: \n(I) (U)  A person known to be currently in the United States will be treated as a United \nStates person unless positively identified as an alien who has not been admitted for \npermanent residence or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such person \nis not a United States person. \n(2) (U)  A person known to be currently outside the United States, or whose location is \nunknown, will not be treated as a United States person unless such person can be \npositively identified as such or circumstances give rise to a reasonable belief that such \nperson is a United States person. \n(3) (U)  A person known to have been at any time an alien admitted for lawful permanent \nresidence is treated as a United States person, unless a determination that such person \nis no longer a United States person is made (a) in consultation with the NSA Office of \nGeneral Counsel after obtaining a copy of either an order revoking that person's \nUnited States person status issued by a U.S. federal court or a properly executed and \nfiled United States Citizenship and Immigration Services Form 1-407 (Record of \nAbandonment of Lawful Permanent Resident Status), or (b) in consultation with the \nNSA Office of General Counsel and NSD. \n( 4) (U)  An unincorporated association whose headquarters or primary office is located \noutside the United States is presumed not to be a United States person unless there is \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n4 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \ninformation indicating that a substantial number of its members are citizens of the \nUnited States or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence. \n(U)  Section 4 - Acquisition and Handling - General \n(a) (U)  Acquisition \n(U)  The acquisition of information by targeting non-United States persons reasonably \nbelieved to be located outside the United States pursuant to section 702 of the Act will be \neffected in accordance with an authorization made by the Attorney General and Director of \nNational Intelligence pursuant to subsection 702(a) of the Act and will be conducted in a \nmanner designed, to the greatest extent reasonably feasible, to minimize the acquisition of \ninformation not relevant to the authorized purpose of the acquisition. \n(b) (U)  Monitoring, Recording, and Handling \n(1) (U)  Personnel will exercise reasonable judgment in determining whether information \nacquired must be minimized and will destroy information of or concerning a United \nStates person at the earliest practicable point at which such information can be \nidentified either: as clearly not relevant to the authorized purpose of the acquisition \n(e .g., the communication does not contain foreign intelligence information); or, as not \ncontaining evidence of a crime which may be disseminated under these procedures. \nExcept as provided for in Section 4(c) below, such information of or concerning a \nUnited States person may be retained no longer than five years from the expiration \ndate of the certification authorizing the collection in any event. \n(2) (U)  Information of or concerning United States persons that may be related to the \nauthorized purpose of the acquisition may be forwarded to analytic personnel \nresponsible for producing intelligence information from the collected data.  Such \ninformation may be retained and disseminated only in accordance with Sections 4, 5, \n6, 7, 8, and 11 of these procedures. \n(3) (U)  For purposes of assessing how information should be handled in accordance with \nthese procedures, as information is reviewed, NSA analyst(s) will a) determine \nwhether it is a domestic or foreign communication; 1 b) ensure that it is not a \ncommunication that contains a reference to, but is not to or from, a target; and c) \ndetermine whether it is reasonably believed to contain foreign intelligence \ninformation or evidence of a crime. \n1   \n \n \n \n \n \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n5 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n( 4) (U)  Queries of unminimized content or noncontent information acquired in \naccordance with section 702 of the Act are governed by the Querying Procedures \nUsed in Connection with Acquisitions of Foreign Intelligence Information Pursuant to \nSection 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, as Amended.  All \nsuch queries conducted by NSA personnel must be made in accordance with those \nprocedures.  Authorized NSA users with access to unminimized section 702-acquired \ninformation should handle the results of an appropriate query of unminimized section \n702-acquired information in accordance with these minimization procedures. \n(U)  Further handling, retention, and dissemination of foreign communications will be \nmade in accordance with Sections 4, 5, 7, 8, and 11, as applicable, below.  Further \nhandling, storage, and dissemination of inadvertently acquired domestic \ncommunications will be made in accordance with Sections 4, 5, 6, and 8 below. \n(c ) (U)  Destruction of Raw Data \n(1) (TS//SI//NF)  Information acquired through tasking Internet selectors by or with the \nassistance of the FBI from Internet Service Providers, through tasking telephony \nselectors, or through   that does not meet the retention standards set \nforth in these procedures and that is known to contain information of or concerning \nUnited States persons will be destroyed upon recognition.  Information acquired \nthrough tasking Internet selectors by or with the assistance of the FBI from Internet \nService Providers, through tasking telephony selectors, or through   \nmay not be retained longer than five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection unless NSA specifically determines that each specific item \nof acquired information meets the retention standards in these procedures. \n(2) (U)  Internet transactions acquired on or before March 17, 2017, will be destroyed \nupon recognition.  Internet transactions acquired through NSA's upstream collection \ntechniques acquired on or after March 18, 2017, that do not contain any information \nthat meets the retention standards set forth in these procedures and that are known to \ncontain communications of or concerning United States persons will be destroyed \nupon recognition.  An Internet transaction acquired on or after March 18, 2017, may \nnot be retained longer than five years from the expiration date of the certification \nauthorizing the collection unless NSA specifically determines that at least one \ndiscrete communication within the Internet transaction meets the retention standards \nin these procedures. \n(3) (U)  Any communications acquired pursuant to section 702 that contain a reference \nto, but are not to or from, a person targeted in accordance with section 702 targeting \nprocedures are unauthorized acquisitions and therefore will be destroyed upon \nrecognition. 2 \n2 (U)  In applying this provision, note that any user of a tasked selector is regarded as a person targeted for \nacquisition. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n6 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n( 4)  (U)  In addition, NSA will follow the following procedures: \na.  (U)  Notwithstanding the destruction requirements set forth in these minimization \nprocedures, NSA may retain specific section 702-acquired information if the \nDepartment of Justice advises NSA in writing that such information is subject to a \npreservation obligation in pending or anticipated administrative, civil, or criminal \nlitigation.  The Department of Justice will identify in writing the specific \ninformation to be retained (including, but not limited to, the target(s) or selector(s) \nwhose information must be preserved and the relevant time period at issue in the \nlitigation), and the particular litigation for which the information will be retained. \nIn order to restrict access to information being retained pursuant to this provision, \npersonnel not working on the particular litigation matter shall not access the \nsection 702-acquired information preserved pursuant to a written preservation \nnotice from the Department of Justice that would otherwise have been destroyed \npursuant to these procedures.  Other personnel shall only access the information \nbeing retained for litigation-related reasons on a case-by-case basis after \nconsultation with the Department of Justice.  The Department of Justice shall \nnotify NSA in writing once the section 702-acquired information is no longer \nrequired to be preserved for such litigation matters, and then NSA shall promptly \ndestroy the section 702-acquired information as otherwise required by these \nprocedures. \n1.  (U)  Each year, NSA and NSD will prepare a summary of: (a) all \nadministrative, civil, or criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation \nof section 702-acquired data that would otherwise be subject to age off \npursuant to these procedures, (b) a description of the section 702-acquired \ninformation preserved for each such litigation matter, and (c) if possible based \non the information available to NSA, a description of the status of each such \nlitigation matter. \n2.  (U)  In certain circumstances, NSA may receive written notice from the \nDepartment of Justice advising NSA to preserve section 702-acquired \ninformation that would otherwise be subject to a destruction requirement \nunder Sections 4(b)(l), 4(d)(2), 4(e), 5, or 6.  NSA will promptly \nprovide NSD with a summary of: (a) all administrative, civil, or criminal \nlitigation matters necessitating preservation of section 702-acquired \ninformation that would otherwise be subject to destruction pursuant to \nSections 4(b)(l), 4(d)(2), 4(e), 5, or 6, (b) a description of the section 702-\nacquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and ( c) if \npossible based on the information available to NSA, a description of the status \nof each such litigation matter.  When such circumstances arise, NSD will \npromptly notify the FISC. \nb.  (U)  The Department of Justice may advise NSA to retain specific section 702-\nacquired information subject to a destruction requirement other than those \nspecified above in this section because such information is subject to a \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n7 \n\nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \npreservation obligation in pending or anticipated administrative, civil, or criminal \nlitigation.  NSA will provide NSD with a summary of: (a) all administrative, civil, \nor criminal litigation matters necessitating preservation of section 702-acquired \ninformation that would otherwise be subject to destruction, (b) a description of the \nsection 702-acquired information preserved for each such litigation matter, and \n(c) if possible, based on the information available to NSA, a description of the \nstatus of each such litigation matter.  NSD will promptly notify and subsequently \nseek authorization from the FISC to retain the material as appropriate and \nconsistent with law.  NSA will restrict access to and retain such information in the \nmanner described in Section 4(c)(4)(a), at the direction of the Department of \nJustice until either the FISC denies a government request for authorization to \nretain the information or the Department of Justice notifies NSA in writing that \nthe information is no longer required to be preserved for such litigation matters. \nAfter receiving such notice, NSA shall promptly destroy the section 702-acquired \ninformation. \n(d ) (U)  Change in Target's Location or Status \n(1) (U)  In the event that NSA reasonably believes that a target is located outside the \nUnited States and subsequently learns that the person is inside the United States, or if \nNSA concludes that a target who at the time of targeting was believed to be a non \nUnited States person is in fact a United States person at the time of acquisition, the \nacquisition from that person will be terminated without delay. \n(2) (U)  Any information acquired through the targeting of a person who at the time of \ntargeting was reasonably believed to be located outside the United States but is in fact \nlocated inside the United States at the time such information was acquired, and any \ninformation acquired by targeting a person who at the time of targeting was believed \nto be a non-United States person but was in fact a United States person at the time \nsuch information was acquired, will be treated as domestic communications under \nthese procedures. \n(e) (S//NF)  In the event that NSA seeks to use any information acquired pursuant to section \n702 during a time period when there is uncertainty about the location of the target of the \nacquisition because the  post-tasking checks described in NSA's section 702 \ntargeting procedures were not functioning properly, NSA will follow its internal \nprocedures for determining whether such information may be used (including, but not \nlimited to, in FISA applications, section 702 targeting, and disseminations).  Except as \nnecessary to assess location under this provision, NSA may not use or disclose any \ninformation acquired pursuant to section 702 during such time period unless NSA \ndetermines, based on the totality of the circumstances, that the target is reasonably \nbelieved to have been located outside the United States at the time the information was \nacquired.  If NSA determines that the target is reasonably believed to have been located \ninside the United States at the time the information was acquired, such information will \nnot be used and will be promptly destroyed. \nTOP SECRET//S1//NOFORN \n8 \n\nTOP SECRET//SI//NOFORN \n(f)  (U)  Additional Measures Regarding the Handling and Disposition of Improper Taskings \n(1) (U//FOUO) NSD shall promptly review the documentation from NSA of the basis for \ntasking selectors to section 702 acquisition.  NSA shall cooperate in that effort.  In the \nevent such review leads NSD to assess that the basis for tasking any selector may be \ninsufficient for targeting under a certification or authorization approved under section \n702, or otherwise may not be in accordance with NSA's section 702 targeting \nprocedures at the time of tasking, NSD will promptly provide NSA and ODNI with \nwritten notification of that assessment. \n(2) (U//FOUO)  Upon receipt of such assessment by NSD, NSA shall promptly, and not \nlater than 10 business days, initiate the steps required to (1) identify all information \nacquired from the tasking of that selector and reporting of such information and (2) \nplace the identifiers for that information on the Master Purge List (MPL) or successor \nsystem as they are identified to limit further use or dissemination of that information. \nNSA shall promptly, and not later than 90 calendar days after written notification, \ncomplete the steps required to identify and limit the use of all information acquired \nfrom the tasking. In the event that NSA is unable to complete these activities within \nthe time periods specified in this paragraph, NSA will promptly report the reasons it \nis unable to do so to NSD and ODNI, and NSD will promptly notify the FISC in \nwriting. \n(3) (U//FOUO)  Once written notification has been made under Section 4(f)(l), NSD and \nODNI shall make a final determination regarding the propriety of the tasking as \nexpeditiously as practical.  NSA shall cooperate in that effort.  NSD shall promptly \nsubmit a written report to the FISC describing the circumstances for which a final \ndetermination has not been made within 60 calendar days of the written notification \nunder Section 4(f)( 1) . \n( 4) (U//FOUO)  Upon written notification of a final determination by NSD and ODNI \nthat the tasking of such selector was not proper under section 702 at the time of \ntasking, and following the completion of the steps required to identify and limit the \nuse of all information acquired from the tasking as described in Section 4(f)(2), NSA \nshall promptly, and not later than 30 calendar days, complete the steps required for \ndestroying all information acquired from the tasking of such selector and revise or \nrecall relevant disseminations containing that information, informing the recipients of \nany recalled dissemination that it has been recalled as a result of a FISA-related \ncompliance incident and therefore may not be further disclosed or used for any \npurpose.
