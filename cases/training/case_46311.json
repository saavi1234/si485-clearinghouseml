Furthermore, Nan Zhong signed the Complaint Individually and as President of SWORD. Plaintiff SWORD (Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination) has failed to comply with Text Orders 5 & 6. See Docket. Plaintiff Nan Zhong is directed to file a detailed status report by 5/12/2025 advising the Court why Plaintiff SWORD (Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination) has failed to comply with Court Orders 5 & 6. Plaintiff SWORD is directed to comply with Text Orders 5 & 6 by 5/12/2025. Plaintiff SWORD (Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination) appears to be an Unincorporated Entity and therefore is not permitted to appear pro se in this litigation. Plaintiff SWORD must be represented by a licensed attorney in this matter. No later than 5/12/2025, a licensed attorney representing Plaintiff SWORD shall file a notice of appearance on the docket. Pro se Plaintiffs Nan Zhong and Stanley Zhong may only represent themselves individually in a pro se manner or each may be represented by a New York licensed attorney who is also admitted to practice law in the Northern District of New York. See 28 U.S.C. § 1654 (In all courts of the United States the parties may plead and conduct their own cases personally or by counsel as, by the rules of such courts, respectively, are permitted to manage and conduct causes therein.); United States ex rel. v. Mergent Servs. v. Flaherty, 540 F.3d 89, 92 (2d Cir. 2008) (Because [§1654] permits parties only to plead and conduct their own cases personally, we have held that an individual who is not licensed as an attorney may not appear on another persons behalf in the others cause. Therefore, Pro se Plaintiff Nan Zhong is not permitted to represent Stanley Zhong or SWORD, and Stanley Zhong is not permitted to represent Nan Zhong or SWORD. Plaintiffs are advised that failure to comply with Court Orders may result in sanctions being imposed including dismissal of this case. Plaintiffs are directed to comply with Text Orders 5 & 6 and this Text Order. SO ORDERED by U.S. Magistrate Judge Miroslav Lovric on 4/28/2025.

On March 22, 2025, an individual who was denied admission to Cornell University, his father, and the advocacy group Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination (SWORD) filed this lawsuit against Cornell in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York. Filing pro se, the plaintiffs sued under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 USC &sect; 1983. They alleged that Cornell discriminates against Asian American applicants in its admissions process, in violation of Title VI and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including mandatory training and compliance measures instituted at Cornell. The case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth C. Coombe.</p>\r\n<p>According to the complaint, one of the plaintiffs was denied admission to Cornell and 15 other elite colleges despite his credentials, which included having a near-perfect score on the SAT and a GPA higher than 4.0, managing his own start up, and being offered a PhD-level job at Google before graduating high school. The complaint cited multiple pieces of evidence to support its assertion that anti-Asian discrimination is widespread at elite American universities, including surveys from admission officers and statements made in litigation documents of the 2023 Supreme Court decision <em><a href=\"../../../../case/14188/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SFFA v. Harvard</a></em>, which held that Harvard's race-based affirmative action program was unconstitutional.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing as of April 2025.</p>",

INTRODUCTION\n7   1.  Plaintiffs Stanley Zhong (“Stanley”), Nan Zhong (“Nan”), and Students\n8   Who Oppose Racial Discrimination (“SWORD”), represented by Nan\n9   Zhong on behalf of its members and all others similarly situated,\n10  collectively referred to as “Plaintiffs,” bring this civil rights action against\n11  Cornell University (“Cornell”, “Defendant”) for engaging in racially\n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page 1  o f 1 47 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 2 of 147\n 1   discriminatory admissions practices that disadvantage highly qualified \n 2   Asian-American applicants, including Stanley and members of SWORD. \n 3   2.   Despite Stanley’s exceptional academic achievements and remarkable \n 4   professional accomplishments at a young age, his application to the \n 5   undergraduate program at Cornell University was rejected. This result \n 6   stands in stark contrast to his receipt of a full-time job offer from Google \n 7   for a position requiring a Ph.D. degree or equivalent practical experience. \n 8   3.   Stanley’s experience is emblematic of a broader pattern of racial \n 9   discrimination against highly qualified Asian-American applicants at \n 10   Cornell. These admissions practices violate the Fourteenth Amendment to \n 11   the United States Constitution, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n 12  II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n 13   4.   This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, \n 14   as this action arises under the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n 15   including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. \n 16   5.   Venue is proper in this district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) because a \n 17   substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim \n 18   occurred in this district. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  2  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 3 of 147\n 1  III. PARTIES \n 2   A. Plaintiffs \n 3   A1. Co-plaintiff Stanley Zhong \n 4   6.   Co-plaintiff Stanley Zhong, born in 2005, is an Asian American residing in \n 5   California. Stanley’s parents are first-generation immigrants to the United \n 6   States from China. Stanley Zhong is a US citizen. \n 7   7.   As a self-taught programmer, Stanley has distinguished himself in various \n 8   coding contests, ranking highly enough to receive an invitation from \n 9   Google for a full-time job interview in 2019, without Google realizing he \n 10   was only 13 years old. Upon disclosure of his age, the interview was \n 11   canceled due to Google’s policy against hiring minors (See  Exhibit 1  for \n 12   email exchanges with a Google recruiter). \n 13   8.   Competing against top professionals from around the world, Stanley \n 14   advanced to the Google Code Jam Coding Contest semi-final in 2021 \n 15   (See  Exhibit 2  ). \n 16   9.   Competing against top professionals from around the world, Stanley \n 17   advanced to the Meta (Facebook) Hacker Cup semi-final in 2023 (See \n 18   Exhibit 3  ). \n 19   10.  Stanley won the 2nd place in MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) \n 20   Battlecode's global high school division twice (2nd place and 1st place in \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  3  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 4 of 147\n 1   the US, respectively) (See  Exhibit 4 ) . He was invited to MIT with expenses \n 2   paid. \n 3   11.  Stanley won the 2nd Place in CMU (Carnegie Mellon University) \n 4   cybersecurity competition picoCTF  (  See  Exhibit 5  ).  He was invited to CMU \n 5   with expenses paid. \n 6   12.  Stanley won the 6th place in Stanford ProCo (See  Exhibit  6 ) . \n 7   13.  Stanley advanced to the USA Computing Olympiad (USACO) Platinum \n 8   Division (See  Exhibit 7 ) . \n 9   14.  In April 2020, after seeing an NPR news story that the unemployment \n 10   office’s system programmed in COBOL was not keeping up with the \n 11   workload caused by COVID (See  Exhibit 8  ), Stanley  taught himself \n 12   COBOL, sent his sample code on GitHub (See  Exhibit  9  ) to COBOL \n 13   Cowboys featured in the news story, and volunteered to help. Mr. Bill \n 14   Hinshaw, COBOL Cowboys CEO, graciously called Stanley and offered \n 15   encouraging words (although he did mention putting a 14-year-old in front \n 16   of his clients would probably freak them out). (See  Exhibit 10  for the email \n 17   exchange with Mr. Bill Hinshaw to set up the call.) \n 18   15.  After the attempt to volunteer for COBOL Cowboys fell through, Stanley \n 19   saw news reports about surging demand for e-signing services caused by \n 20   the COVID lockdown. Stanley was unhappy that DocuSign didn’t provide \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  4  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 5 of 147\n 1   any relief. So, he launched an unlimited free e-signing service named \n 2   RabbitSign in 2021 (See  Exhibit 11 ) . \n 3   16.  Built on Amazon Web Services (AWS), RabbitSign was designed and \n 4   implemented so well that AWS’s Well-Architected Review concluded that it \n 5   was “one of the most efficient and secure accounts” they’d ever reviewed \n 6   (See  Exhibit 12 ) . \n 7   17.  To showcase RabbitSign’s exemplary use of AWS Serverless and \n 8   compliance services, AWS decided to feature it in a case study—a \n 9   prestigious recognition that is notoriously difficult to attain, even for \n 10   seasoned professionals (See  Exhibit 13 ) . \n 11   18.  Shortly before Stanley turned 18, five randomly selected full-time Google \n 12   engineers, who were specifically trained and qualified to evaluate \n 13   candidates, devoted no less than ten hours collectively to evaluating \n 14   Stanley’s skills, including his technical expertise and soft skills, such as \n 15   teamwork. Based solely on their assessments, without any external \n 16   influence, these Google engineers concluded that Google should hire \n 17   Stanley for an L4 position, which requires a Ph.D. degree or equivalent \n 18   practical experience. Consequently, Google made an offer for a full-time \n 19   L4 position to Stanley in September 2023, shortly after Stanley turned 18 \n 20   (See  Exhibit 14 ) . \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  5  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 6 of 147\n 1   19.  Google’s compensation structure is tied to the level of its employees’ \n 2   positions, creating a natural disincentive to over-assess an employee’s \n 3   qualifications. \n 4   20.  Mr. Dan Bloomberg, a longtime Google employee who served on the \n 5   hiring committees for 18 years, has agreed to testify regarding Google’s \n 6   interview process when this lawsuit proceeds to trial. \n 7   21.  In January 2025, Stanley received his performance evaluation as a \n 8   Google employee for the entirety of 2024, with a rating and manager \n 9   assessment indicating that he fully met the expectations for his position at \n 10   Google and demonstrated a strong growth trajectory. \n 11   22.  Because of his groundbreaking work to provide the world’s only unlimited \n 12   free HIPAA-compliant e-signing service to help lower America’s healthcare \n 13   cost, Stanley received an inbound interview request from  Viewpoint with \n 14   Dennis Quaid ,  a series of short documentaries on innovations  aired on \n 15   CNBC, Fox Business, Bloomberg, and public TV stations across the US. \n 16   Their past guests included President George H.W. Bush, Secretary Colin \n 17   Powell, and Fortune 500 CEOs. (See  Exhibit 15  for  the industry news \n 18   coverage for RabbitSign’s free HIPAA-compliant e-signing. See  Exhibit 16 \n 19   for the episode of  Viewpoint with Dennis Quaid  featuring  RabbitSign and \n 20   Stanley.) \n 21   23.  Stanley’s high school grade point average was 3.97 (unweighted) and \n 22   4.42 (weighted) (See  Exhibit 17  ). \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  6  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 7 of 147\n 1   24.  Although Stanley’s high school does not publish individual student \n 2   rankings based on grade point average, he is confirmed to be at least \n 3   within the top 9% of his class, as he qualified for the University of \n 4   California’s (“UC”) “Eligibility in the Local Context” (ELC). (See  Exhibit 18 \n 5   for Stanley’s ELC qualification.) ELC guarantees admission to a UC \n 6   campus for California high school students who rank in the top 9% of their \n 7   class, as determined by their GPA in UC-approved coursework completed \n 8   in the 10th and 11th grades. \n 9   25.  U.S. News and World Report ranks Stanley’s high school (Henry Gunn \n 10   High School) #14 in California and #135 nationally (See  Exhibit 19 ) . \n 11   26.  Niche ranks Stanley’s high school (Henry Gunn High School) #1 best \n 12   public high school in San Francisco Bay Area and  #4 best public high \n 13   school in California (See  Exhibit 20 ) . \n 14   27.  Stanley achieved a maximum PSAT score without any preparation (See \n 15   Exhibit 21  ). \n 16   28.  Stanley scored 1590 (out of 1600) on the SAT with only a few nights of \n 17   self study without any paid test prep (See  Exhibit  21  as well). He took the \n 18   SAT only once. \n 19   29.  Stanley was a National Merit Scholarship finalist (See  Exhibit 22  ). \n 20   30.  While in high school, Stanley participated in and led numerous \n 21   extracurricular and volunteer activities. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  7  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 8 of 147\n 1   31.  Stanley served as a founding officer and president of the competitive \n 2   programming club at his high school (See  Exhibit 23  ). \n 3   32.  Stanley co-founded and served as the 2nd president of a nonprofit named \n 4   OpenBrackets ,  which brought free coding lessons to  500+ kids in \n 5   underserved communities in California, Washington, and Texas over 2 \n 6   years (See  Exhibit 24  ). It received positive feedback  from Stackoverflow \n 7   co-founder, Mr. Jeff Atwood. \n 8   33.  Because of his work at OpenBrackets, Stanley received the highest level \n 9   of the President’s Volunteer Service Award (See  Exhibit  25  ). \n 10   34.  Stanley’s college application essay was pretty much captured in the \n 11   Viewpoint interview mentioned supra. It discussed why he created \n 12   RabbitSign, how he overcame rejections to eventually find a partner to \n 13   provide free HIPAA-compliant e-signing to help lower America's healthcare \n 14   cost, and how RabbitSign is the first Activism Corporation created to \n 15   counter corporate greed. \n 16   35.  For enrollment in fall 2023, Stanley applied to the undergraduate \n 17   Computer Science program at Cornell University. His application was \n 18   rejected. \n 19   36.  In direct connection with Cornell’s rejection of his applications, Stanley \n 20   Zhong suffered emotional distress. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  8  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 9 of 147\n 1   37.  Stanley’s story was reported in national news in October 2023 (See \n 2   Exhibit 26  ) and cited in a congressional hearing in September 2023 (See \n 3   Exhibit 27  ). \n 4   38.  After Stanley’s story hit the news in October 2023, multiple college \n 5   admission counselors examined his application, including his essay. None \n 6   of them could figure out a legitimate reason why Stanley was rejected. \n 7   Some of them have offered to testify as expert witnesses when this lawsuit \n 8   proceeds to trial. \n 9   39.  Stanley was denied the opportunity to compete for admission to Cornell on \n 10   equal footing with other applicants on the basis of race or ethnicity due to \n 11   Cornell’s discriminatory admissions policies and practices. \n 12   40.  Stanley is ready and able to apply to Cornell when it ceases its intentional \n 13   discrimination against Asian Americans. \n 14   41.  Stanley, Nan, and SWORD reached out to multiple legal resources and \n 15   entities for representation. However, these entities either declined to take \n 16   the case or failed to respond. Consequently, Stanley is compelled to \n 17   represent himself as a pro se litigant. \n 18   A2. Co-plaintiff Nan Zhong \n 19   42.  Co-plaintiff, Nan Zhong, an Asian-American resident of California, is \n 20   Stanley Zhong’s father. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  9  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 10 of 147\n 1   43.  A first-generation immigrant from China, Nan has a direct and personal \n 2   stake in this matter due to the discriminatory practices of Cornell’s \n 3   admissions process. \n 4   44.  The 2024 decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in  Chinese \n 5   American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York (CACAGNY) v. Adams  , \n 6   116 F.4th 161, affirms that an “equal protection claim can be asserted by \n 7   individuals alleging they suffered harm from the discriminatory policy or \n 8   law, as well as other individuals (such as a parent or guardian) or \n 9   organizations that also have standing to sue.” \n 10   45.  Nan suffered emotional distress as a direct result of Cornell’s \n 11   discriminatory policies, thereby establishing his standing to bring this \n 12   claim. \n 13   46.  Nan’s children intend to apply for admission to Cornell but will be denied \n 14   the opportunity to compete on equal footing with other applicants due to \n 15   Cornell’s discriminatory admissions policies. As a result, they may face \n 16   rejection based on race or ethnicity rather than merit. These personal \n 17   impacts further establish Nan’s standing to bring this claim. \n 18   47.  Beyond personal impact, Nan is acutely aware of the chilling effect that \n 19   Asian-American students face when asserting their legal rights in college \n 20   admissions. Public hostility toward such efforts is well-documented, \n 21   particularly on college campuses. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  10  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 11 of 147\n 1   48.  For example, during the  SFFA v. Harvard  trial, widespread protests \n 2   erupted against SFFA’s challenge to race-conscious admissions (See \n 3   Exhibit 28  ). Even after the Supreme Court ruled against  Harvard, \n 4   then-president Claudine Gay responded with open defiance,  stating  , “We \n 5   will comply with the court’s decision. But it doesn’t change our values.” \n 6   (See  Exhibit 29 . ) While the first half of her statement  reflects legal \n 7   necessity, the latter half unmistakably signals defiance. Notably, following \n 8   the Supreme Court’s ruling in SFFA, not a single Harvard administrator \n 9   apologized for the harm their policies inflicted on Asian-American \n 10   applicants. \n 11   49.  Academics such as Professor Janelle Wong and Professor Viet Thanh \n 12   Nguyen publicly  asserted  that no Asian American had  suffered \n 13   discrimination in the college admissions process, misleading the public \n 14   with statements like, “Not a single Asian-American student has testified \n 15   that they faced discrimination in the high-profile Harvard case.” (See \n 16   Exhibit 30  .) Such assertions are demonstrably inaccurate  and serve to \n 17   suppress legitimate grievances. On November 4, 2024, Nan challenged \n 18   both Professor Janelle Wong and Professor Viet Thanh Nguyen to a public \n 19   debate. Neither replied as of the filing of this lawsuit. \n 20   50.  This hostile climate has a direct, suppressive effect on potential plaintiffs. \n 21   Many Asian-American applicants rejected by colleges initially expressed \n 22   interest in joining SWORD’s lawsuit. However, after spending just a few \n 23   months on college campuses as freshmen, most withdrew. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  11  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 12 of 147\n 1   51.  A particularly striking example occurred at a panel discussion following a \n 2   screening of the MSNBC documentary  Admission Granted  in San \n 3   Francisco on May 9, 2024. The reaction of the audience, a few hundred \n 4   people strong, vividly illustrated this bias. When the moderator introduced \n 5   a Harvard student advocating for race-conscious admissions, the room \n 6   erupted in thunderous applause and cheers. In contrast, the \n 7   Asian-American student whose case launched the SFFA lawsuit received \n 8   only sparse clapping—approximately a quarter of which likely came from \n 9   Nan alone. \n 10   52.  This pervasive social hostility—manifesting in microaggressions and overt \n 11   hostility—creates a profound chilling effect that discourages \n 12   Asian-American students from challenging discriminatory policies, \n 13   effectively silencing those who have been harmed. It is therefore \n 14   reasonable to infer that numerous Asian-American applicants, either \n 15   already harmed by Cornell’s admissions practices or anticipating future \n 16   discrimination, remain silent due to legitimate concerns about retaliation or \n 17   social pressure. Under the chilling effects doctrine, which recognizes that \n 18   individuals may refrain from asserting their rights due to fear of reprisal, \n 19   Nan’s standing to sue is further reinforced. \n 20   53.  Stanley, Nan, and SWORD reached out to multiple legal resources and \n 21   entities for representation. However, these entities either declined to take \n 22   the case or failed to respond. Consequently, Nan is compelled to \n 23   represent himself as a pro se litigant. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  12  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 13 of 147\n 1   A3. Co-plaintiff Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination (SWORD) \n 2   54.  Co-plaintiff, Students Who Oppose Racial Discrimination (“SWORD”), is a \n 3   voluntary membership organization focused on stopping racial \n 4   discrimination in college admissions through litigations. It was established \n 5   in October 2024 by people harmed and outraged by flagrant racial \n 6   discrimination in college admissions. \n 7   55.  SWORD is a coalition comprising prospective applicants to higher \n 8   education institutions, individuals who were denied admission, their \n 9   parents, and supporters of the organization’s mission to eliminate racial \n 10   discrimination in higher education admissions. \n 11   56.  Nan Zhong is the President of SWORD. \n 12   57.  SWORD’s website is  https://sword.education .  \n 13   58.  SWORD has at least one Asian-American member who is currently in high \n 14   school and intends to apply for admission to Cornell (“Future Applicants”). \n 15   59.  Future Applicants will be denied the opportunity to compete for admission \n 16   to Cornell on equal footing with other applicants on the basis of race or \n 17   ethnicity due to Cornell’s discriminatory admissions policies. As a result, \n 18   Future Applicants may be denied admission to Cornell because of these \n 19   discriminatory policies and practices. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  13  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 14 of 147\n 1   60.  SWORD has at least one Asian-American member whose children either \n 2   intend to apply for admission to Cornell or applied for but were denied \n 3   admission to Cornell in recent years (“Parents”). \n 4   61.  Parents’ children were or will be denied the opportunity to compete for \n 5   admission to Cornell on equal footing with other applicants on the basis of \n 6   race or ethnicity due to Cornell’s discriminatory admissions policies. As a \n 7   result, Parents’ children were or may be denied admission to Cornell \n 8   because of these discriminatory policies and practices. \n 9   62.  Under  Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Commission,  432 U.S. \n 10   333 (1977)  , SWORD qualifies for associational standing  because 1) \n 11   SWORD has members who have standing to sue Cornell themselves, 2) \n 12   this lawsuit is germane to SWORD's purpose, and 3) neither the claim \n 13   asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual \n 14   members in the lawsuit. \n 15   63.  Stanley is not a member of SWORD. \n 16   64.  The emotional toll experienced by Stanley and Nan exemplify the broader \n 17   emotional and potential economic harms associated with racially \n 18   discriminatory admissions practices by Cornell. Such policies do not \n 19   merely affect statistical representation; they impose real-world \n 20   consequences on a large group of individual applicants. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  14  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 15 of 147\n 1   65.  Stanley, Nan, and SWORD reached out to multiple legal resources and \n 2   entities for representation. However, these entities either declined to take \n 3   the case or failed to respond. Consequently, as President of SWORD, Nan \n 4   is compelled to represent the organization as a pro se litigant. \n 5   B. Defendant \n 6   66.  Defendant is a private university in the State of New York. Because it \n 7   receives federal funding, it is subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n 8   1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d  et. seq  . \n 9  IV. FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n 10   A. Asian Applicants Receiving Discriminatory Results \n 11   67.  For undergraduate enrollment in fall 2023, Stanley applied to Cornell. \n 12   Despite his extraordinary qualifications, he was rejected. This outcome \n 13   defies common sense and contradicts expert assessments of his \n 14   application. As the Supreme Court noted in  Miller  v. Johnson ,  515 U.S. \n 15   900,901 (1995), \" b  izarreness  \" can serve as \"persuasive  circumstantial \n 16   evidence that race for its own sake…was a legislature's dominant and \n 17   controlling rationale.\" Similarly, the stark disparity between Stanley’s \n 18   qualifications and the Cornell admissions decisions raises serious \n 19   concerns about the role of race in Cornell’s admissions process. This \n 20   striking incongruity strongly suggests that Cornell’s admissions policies \n 21   are being applied in a discriminatory fashion. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  15  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 16 of 147\n 1   68.  Plaintiffs believe and allege that Stanley’s rejection by Cornell was not \n 2   based on his qualifications but on his race, as an Asian American. \n 3   B. Widespread Anti-Asian Discrimination at Elite Universities \n 4   69.  After the state  audit  in 1987 (See  Exhibit 31  ), University  of California \n 5   Berkeley Chancellor Ira Michael Heyman publicly  apologized  in 1989 for \n 6   admissions policies that led to a decline in Asian-American undergraduate \n 7   enrollment (See  Exhibit 32 ) . \n 8   70.  On September 22, 2016,  Inside Higher Education  released  a survey of \n 9   admission officers. It revealed 42% of admission officers from private \n 10   colleges and 39% of admission officers from public colleges believe that \n 11   colleges hold Asian-American applicants to a higher standard (See  Exhibit \n 12   33  ). \n 13   71.  On May 25, 2016, Dr. Michele Hernandez, former Dartmouth admission \n 14   officer,  revealed  on  Huffington Post  “how even the  so-called ‘holistic \n 15   process’ can discriminate against Asian students” and how Ivy League \n 16   college admission officers often use racial stereotypes to discriminate \n 17   against Asian-American applicants (See  Exhibit 34 ) . \n 18   72.  Harvard openly gave preferential treatment to some racial groups at the \n 19   expense of Asian-American applicants until its practice was ruled illegal by \n 20   the Supreme Court in  SFFA v. Harvard  in 2023. Notably,  following the \n 21   Supreme Court’s ruling in SFFA, not a single Harvard administrator \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  16  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 17 of 147\n 1   apologized for the harm their policies inflicted on Asian-American \n 2   applicants. \n 3   73.  As documented in the  SFFA’s legal complaint  against  Harvard (page 60), \n 4   Asian-American applicants and their families know that they are being \n 5   discriminated against by elite universities (See  Exhibit  35  ). \n 6   74.  As documented in the  SFFA’s legal complaint  against  Harvard (page 57), \n 7   college counselors acknowledge discrimination against Asian Americans \n 8   at elite universities (See  Exhibit 36 ) . \n 9   75.  It is well documented that many Asian-American applicants attempt to \n 10   appear “less Asian” on their college applications to avoid potential bias \n 11   (See  Exhibit 37 ) . \n 12   76.  Admission officers at elite universities have described Asian-American \n 13   applicants using derogatory racial stereotypes, such as labeling them as \n 14   \"yet another textureless math grind\" (See  Exhibit  39 ) . \n 15   77.  Evidence also shows that elite universities were aware of discriminatory \n 16   practices but often ignored or denied the issue until confronted with legal \n 17   challenges. For instance, in 2006, Jian Li, an Asian-American applicant, \n 18   filed a formal complaint against Princeton University for racial \n 19   discrimination in admissions. Following this action, Princeton's admission \n 20   rate for Asian-American students rose from 14.7% in 2007 to 25.4% in \n 21   2014 (See  Exhibit 38  ). Similarly, after SFFA sued  Harvard in 2015, the \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  17  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 18 of 147\n 1   percentage of Asian-American admits increased from 17% in 2014 to 22% \n 2   in 2016 (See  Exhibit 38  as well). \n 3   78.  These patterns demonstrate a troubling reality: institutions were capable \n 4   of increasing Asian-American enrollment with little change in applicant \n 5   qualifications, suggesting prior suppression of Asian admissions through \n 6   discriminatory policies. This raises legal concerns about Cornell’s own \n 7   admissions practices. Legal scrutiny is warranted to uncover the extent of \n 8   Cornell’s awareness of and complicity in similar practices that have \n 9   disadvantaged highly qualified Asian-American applicants. \n 10   79.  Compiling his Pulitzer Prize-winning reporting into a book titled  The Price \n 11   of Admission  , Daniel Golden documented multiple highly  qualified Asian \n 12   applicants rejected by the University of California, Harvard, Yale, \n 13   Princeton, Brown, Columbia, Stanford, and Massachusetts Institute of \n 14   Technology. For example, UCLA rejected Stanley Park, a Korean \n 15   American student who faced serious adversity (single immigrant parent \n 16   with cancer and no college degree), while accepting non-Asian students \n 17   with SAT scores 520 and 560 points lower. (See  Exhibit  39  for the relevant \n 18   excerpt from  The Price of Admission . ) \n 19   80.  In 2003, Mr. John Moores, then chairman of the UC Board of Regents, \n 20   accused UC’s flagship campus of “blatantly” discriminating against Asian \n 21   Americans (See  Exhibit 40 ) . \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  18  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 19 of 147\n 1   81.  Following the implementation of a holistic review system, UCLA prohibited \n 2   faculty members on its Admissions Committee from accessing admissions \n 3   data. In response, Professor Tim Groseclose invoked whistleblower \n 4   protections and resigned from UCLA in protest (See  Exhibit 41 ) . In \n 5   Cheating: An Insider's Report on the Use of Race in Admissions at UCLA ,  \n 6   Professor Groseclose described how then-UCLA Chancellor Norm \n 7   Abrams explicitly cited raising African American enrollment as the \n 8   motivation behind adopting holistic admissions. In addition, Professor \n 9   Groseclose’s statistical analysis showed that, for a group of applicants \n 10   receiving the same scores from their initial readers, UCLA admitted 55% \n 11   poor African Americans, 38% rich African Americans, 23% poor North \n 12   Asians and 18% rich North Asians. Note that  rich  African  Americans were \n 13   admitted much more frequently than  poor  North Asians.  UC never \n 14   disputed the accuracy of Professor Groseclose’s account. (See  Exhibit 42 \n 15   for excerpts from Professor Tim Groseclose’s book  Cheating . ) \n 16   82.  In a study commissioned by UCLA, only later obtained through public \n 17   records requests, sociology professor Robert Mare  documented  a \n 18   consistent pattern of anti-Asian discrimination in admissions at UCLA. His \n 19   report said, “‘North Asian’ (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian/Pakistani \n 20   American) applicants receive somewhat less favorable holistic read scores \n 21   than applicants in other ethnic identity groups who are otherwise similar in \n 22   measured academic qualifications, personal characteristics, and \n 23   measured challenges and hardships.” It further indicated that “among \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  19  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 20 of 147\n 1   otherwise equivalent applicants, whites, African Americans and Latinos \n 2   are overrepresented among those admitted, and Asian-American \n 3   applicants are underrepresented.” Additionally, the report noted that “the \n 4   disadvantages of Asian applicants occur, with varying magnitudes, \n 5   throughout the admissions process.” (See Exhibit 56 in case 2:25-cv-0495 \n 6   in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California). \n 7   83.  After Dr. Jennifer Lucero took over UCLA medical school admissions in \n 8   June 2020, the number of Asian matriculants at UCLA medical school \n 9   declined from 84 to 55 from 2019 through 2022, a drop of 35% (See \n 10   Exhibit 43  ). Precipitous changes in admission rates  strongly suggest \n 11   deliberate conscious race-based directives. \n 12   C. Deep-Rooted Culture of Identity Over Academics and Legal Evasion \n 13  in Higher Education \n 14   84.  According to a survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and \n 15   Expression, 88% of Cornell’s students self-censor their speech on \n 16   campus. \n 17   85.  Around 1990, then-University of Michigan (UM) President James J. \n 18   Duderstadt instituted the  Michigan Mandate  , describing  it as “a blueprint \n 19   for fundamental change in the ethnic composition of the university \n 20   community.” (See  Exhibit 44  .) He claimed it strategically  linked 'academic \n 21   excellence and social diversity.' Decades later, the current UM President \n 22   Santa Ono echoed this sentiment, stating, “At the University of Michigan, \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  20  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 21 of 147\n 1   we are convinced that academic excellence goes hand-in-hand with \n 2   diversity, inclusion and equity.” However, UM’s rejection of highly qualified \n 3   applicants like Stanley suggests a departure from genuine academic \n 4   excellence in favor of ideological priorities. \n 5   86.  In 2023, Brown University’s Medical School prioritized Diversity, Equity, \n 6   and Inclusion (DEI) over clinical skills in its  faculty  promotion criteria ,  \n 7   raising concerns about the potential impact on patient care quality (See \n 8   Exhibit 45  ). \n 9   87.  Mr. Steven Dubinett, the dean of UCLA medical school, directs a center \n 10   that houses a race-based fellowship. Its web page was deleted after \n 11   media exposure (See  Exhibit 46  ), indicating awareness  of its illegality. \n 12   88.  A New York Times  opinion piece  by a former UC admissions  reader \n 13   shared her detection of “unspoken directives”, questioned whether \n 14   “Proposition 209 serve(s) merely to push race underground” and \n 15   described the admission reading process as “an extreme version of the \n 16   American non-conversation about race.” (See  Exhibit  47  .) \n 17   89.  Following public outcry over the Varsity Blues scandal, California state \n 18   lawmakers commissioned an audit of the University of California’s \n 19   admissions practices. The California State Auditor’s 2020  report  found that \n 20   UC “has allowed for improper influence in admissions decisions, and it has \n 21   not treated applicants fairly or consistently.” Specifically, the audit revealed \n 22   that UC Berkeley and UCLA ”admitted thousands of applicants whose \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  21  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 22 of 147\n 1   records demonstrated that they were less qualified than other applicants \n 2   who were denied admission.” (See  Exhibit 48  ). \n 3   90.  Admissions and hiring are inherently interconnected and inseparable in \n 4   the context of racial discrimination within educational institutions. Faculty \n 5   and administrators play a pivotal role in shaping academic standards, \n 6   mentoring students, and influencing the culture and policies of a university, \n 7   including admissions criteria and practices. A racially biased hiring \n 8   process can create and perpetuate a discriminatory culture by fostering an \n 9   environment where certain racial perspectives are prioritized over \n 10   objective, merit-based considerations. Racially-motivated hiring policies \n 11   often have a direct ripple effect on student admissions. It is unrealistic and \n 12   unreasonable to assume that a university can operate one process in a \n 13   race-conscious manner while keeping the other race-neutral, as both are \n 14   fundamentally linked in their goals and execution. Therefore, examining \n 15   both admissions and hiring practices is essential to providing a holistic \n 16   assessment of whether a university's policies violate constitutional and \n 17   statutory protections against racial discrimination. \n 18   91.  In a public  talk  to a large audience, Professor Erwin  Chemerinsky, the \n 19   Dean of the University of California Berkeley Law School, admitted that his \n 20   school systematically considers race in its internal decision-making and \n 21   actively conceals this practice (See  Exhibit 49  ).  As evidenced in the video, \n 22   when discussing the consideration of race in faculty hiring, Mr. \n 23   Chemerinsky described and preached the “unstated Affirmative Action” \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  22  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 23 of 147\n 1   practiced at UC as follows: “Don’t say that [you are considering the \n 2   candidate’s race]. You can think it. You can vote it… Don’t ever articulate \n 3   that is what you are doing.” He also said \"If I'm ever deposed, I'm going to \n 4   deny I said this to you.\" His statements reveal deliberate intent by senior \n 5   university administrators to actively conceal their use of race in \n 6   decision-making. \n 7   92.  In November 2022,  The New Yorker  staff writer Jay  Caspian Kang  quoted \n 8   Mr. Erwin Chemerinsky as follows: \n 9   “What colleges and universities will need to do after affirmative action \n 10   is eliminated is find ways to achieve diversity that can’t be \n 11   documented as violating the Constitution,” Mr. Chemerinsky stated. \n 12   “So they can’t have any explicit use of race. They have to make sure \n 13   that their admissions statistics don’t reveal any use of race. But they \n 14   can use proxies for race.” (See  Exhibit 49  as well.) \n 15   This statement is a clear acknowledgment that university officials intend to \n 16   bypass constitutional and legal prohibitions on racial discrimination by \n 17   employing indirect methods—namely, “proxies for race”—to achieve the \n 18   same racial outcomes that explicit race-based policies once facilitated. \n 19   93.  The use of racial proxies to achieve racial balancing is unconstitutional. In \n 20   Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1  , \n 21   551 U.S. 701, 743 (2007), the Supreme Court held that racial balancing is \n 22   not a compelling state interest and that the government may not achieve \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  23  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 24 of 147\n 1   racial diversity through indirect methods that amount to race-conscious \n 2   decision-making. Similarly, in  SFFA v. Harvard ,  600  U.S. 181 (2023), the \n 3   Supreme Court reaffirmed that admissions policies designed to achieve \n 4   racial diversity by using proxies for race are equally unconstitutional. \n 5   94.  The statements made by Mr. Chemerinsky provide strong circumstantial \n 6   evidence that senior university administrators are knowingly and \n 7   deliberately structuring its admissions policies to evade legal prohibitions \n 8   on racial discrimination. \n 9   95.  As a law professor, Mr. Chemerinsky must know what he was preaching is \n 10   illegal. By his own admission, he clearly knew it was illegal. Yet, he \n 11   preached it with a sense of pride and braggadocio. It is worth emphasizing \n 12   that Mr. Chemerinsky is the Dean, the top administrator, of UC Berkeley \n 13   Law School. Mr. Chemerinsky’s statements happened to be in a public \n 14   talk, happened to be captured in video, and happened to be shared on the \n 15   web. What is visible to the public must be only the tip of the iceberg. It is \n 16   reasonable to infer the preaching and practice of “unstated Affirmative \n 17   Action” is widespread in universities’ admissions and hiring process, which \n 18   lacks transparency and accountability. \n 19   96.  Similar to the 'unstated Affirmative Action' approach advocated by Mr. \n 20   Chemerinsky at UC, the University of Washington (UW) implemented this \n 21   practice by re-ranking candidates based on race while maintaining an \n 22   appearance of neutrality. In 2023, the UW psychology department’s hiring \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  24  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 25 of 147\n 1   committee  re-ranked  finalists to prioritize hiring a Black candidate over a \n 2   white and an Asian candidate who were originally ranked first and second, \n 3   respectively. UW’s  report  concluded that “race was  used as a substantial \n 4   factor in the selection of the final candidate and the hiring process.” The \n 5   report, which redacts all the names of those involved, suggests that faculty \n 6   members tried to hide the extent to which race was considered, including \n 7   in the hiring report. “I advise deleting the statement below as it shows that \n 8   URM [underrepresented minority] applications were singled out and \n 9   evaluated differently than non-URM applications (which is not allowed as \n 10   [redacted] noted),” one email read, according to the report. \"My inclination \n 11   is to hold these meetings only for POC [People of Color] candidates. I'm \n 12   also mindful that our Provost is now getting anxious about anything that's \n 13   directed to only some identity groups (i.e., they are getting worried about \n 14   fallout from the pending Supreme Court affirmative action rulings),\" a \n 15   person wrote in an email. \"My read is that they'll get fearful of litigation and \n 16   overcorrect into colorblindness. Maybe our committee can preemptively \n 17   think our way around this type of future directive,\" the faculty member \n 18   wrote. (See Exhibit 53 in case 2:25-cv-00348 in the U.S. District Court for \n 19   the Western District of Washington.) A report by the National Association \n 20   of Scholars  revealed  that the University of Washington’s  Associate Vice \n 21   Provost, the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Dean of \n 22   Natural Sciences played major roles in implementing the race-based hiring \n 23   directive. However, after the exposure, they attempted to shift blame \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  25  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 26 of 147\n 1   entirely onto the Psychology Department. This case provides a concrete \n 2   example of how UW’s senior administrators prioritized race in hiring, \n 3   knowingly violating the law. The incident only came to light probably due to \n 4   a public records request from an external group. Given the pervasive \n 5   culture of racial preference, it is reasonable to infer that this was not an \n 6   isolated occurrence. \n 7   97.  Senior university administrators not only preach and practice “unstated \n 8   Affirmative Action”, they also actively  persecute  those who advocate for \n 9   academic excellence over identity politics. From 2022 to 2024, Professor \n 10   Perry Link, Chancellorial Chair for Teaching Across Disciplines at UC \n 11   Riverside and a leading authority on modern and contemporary Chinese \n 12   literature and culture, faced disciplinary action after expressing concerns \n 13   during a faculty search committee meeting about prioritizing a Black \n 14   candidate’s race over qualifications. His comments, which he stated were \n 15   intended to caution against elevating race as the “overriding criterion,” \n 16   were reported to university officials without his knowledge. Professor Link \n 17   was subsequently removed from the search committee and subjected to a \n 18   prolonged disciplinary process, including hearings resembling a trial, \n 19   where termination was suggested as a penalty. Although a faculty \n 20   committee unanimously found him innocent of the charges, Chancellor \n 21   Kim Wilcox issued a formal  letter of censure ,  overriding  the committee’s \n 22   recommendation (See  Exhibit 50 ) . Professor Perry Link  was accused of \n 23   making racist comments during the hiring process but was not informed of \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  26  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 27 of 147\n 1   the specific remarks deemed problematic until nearly a year later. UC \n 2   Riverside eventually acquitted him of all charges but allegedly threatened \n 3   to penalize him if he spoke publicly about the ordeal. Despite UC’s threats, \n 4   Professor Link, a distinguished scholar at age 80, courageously made the \n 5   incident  public (See  Exhibit 51 ) . If UC has attempted  to silence a \n 6   prominent tenured professor, it is reasonable to infer the tremendous \n 7   pressure any professor, non-tenured administrator or staff would face if \n 8   they were to speak up. Therefore it is reasonable to infer that numerous \n 9   similar cases exist at UC and other universities in which victims chose to \n 10   remain silent, fearing retaliation that could jeopardize their careers and \n 11   livelihoods. This incident highlights senior university administrators' \n 12   preoccupation with immutable characteristics such as race, in clear \n 13   violation of the Constitution. It also demonstrates the great lengths to \n 14   which they go to silence any dissidents or whistleblowers. Furthermore, it \n 15   clearly illustrates the importance of exercising the chilling effect doctrine \n 16   when it comes to the legal standing in lawsuits concerning universities’ \n 17   student admissions and faculty hiring. \n 18   98.  Professor Perry Link has agreed to testify when the lawsuit filed by \n 19   Stanley, Nan and SWORD against the University of California (Case No. \n 20   2:25-cv-0495 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California) \n 21   goes to trial. \n 22   99.  It is noteworthy that California and Washington have had state laws \n 23   explicitly prohibiting racial preference or discrimination in public education \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  27  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 28 of 147\n 1   since 1996 and 1998, respectively, through Proposition 209 and Initiative \n 2   200. Nevertheless, both the University of California (UC) and the \n 3   University of Washington (UW) appear to have disregarded the will of \n 4   voters and the rule of law. The entrenched culture of legal evasion within \n 5   higher education institutions suggests that many universities continue to \n 6   operate as though they are above the law. \n 7   100.   Both the University of Michigan and the University of California are \n 8   constitutionally prohibited from using racial preferences in student \n 9   admissions. Nevertheless, both institutions have  demonstrated  a clear \n 10   desire to circumvent these bans (See  Exhibit 52 ) .  Reports by Professor \n 11   Robert Mare and the California State Auditor uncovered major issues in \n 12   UC’s admissions practices. After Michigan’s Proposal 2 passed in 2006, \n 13   UM hosted a 2-day workshop featuring UC administrators, who shared \n 14   their strategies for navigating California’s Proposition 209, enacted in \n 15   1996. UC, UW and UM’s actions strongly suggest how other universities \n 16   may be operating. This raises concerns that Cornell is following Mr. \n 17   Chemerinsky’s advice to “just do it without leaving any paper trail.” Such \n 18   tactics could make it difficult for Plaintiffs to obtain direct evidence of \n 19   discriminatory intent against Asian-American applicants. In this context, \n 20   Plaintiffs’ claims should be assessed based on whether Cornell’s \n 21   admissions policies create a discriminatory impact on Asian-American \n 22   applicants, either individually or collectively. As Mr. Chemerinsky himself \n 23   acknowledged, statistical analysis is key to identifying racial discrimination \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  28  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 29 of 147\n 1   in admissions. Plaintiffs intend to conduct such an analysis during the \n 2   discovery phase of this lawsuit. \n 3   D. Cornell’s Discriminatory Hiring \n 4   101.   On July 16, 2020, Cornell President Martha Pollack issued a  statement \n 5   that “we must embed anti-racism across” education and research (See \n 6   Exhibit 53  ). As of March 19, 2025, Cornell still requires  diversity \n 7   statements in faculty hiring (See  Exhibit 54 ) . It  raises the question whether \n 8   Cornell is primarily an academic institution or a political organization. \n 9   102.   In September 2020, a faculty coalition at Cornell University publicly \n 10   demanded  race-based hiring and promotions (See  Exhibit 55 ) , a practice \n 11   that would constitute a clear violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and \n 12   42 U.S.C. § 1981. \n 13   103.   Like the “unstated Affirmative Action” described by Mr. Chemerinsky at \n 14   UC, Cornell’s hiring process appears to be driven by identity while \n 15   maintaining a façade of neutrality. \n 16   104.   On May 22, 2024, according to  Cornell Free Speech  Alliance  , \n 17   whistleblowers  revealed  how DEI Statements are used  as a litmus test to \n 18   eliminate qualified faculty in the hiring process. About 21% of the \n 19   candidates were screened out solely based on DEI criteria. Unlawful \n 20   race-based hiring preferences were applied throughout the entire hiring \n 21   process to eliminate candidates who had less favorable demographic \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  29  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 30 of 147\n 1   characteristics (See  Exhibit 56  ). Such practices are discriminatory and \n 2   constitute violations of both federal and New York State \n 3   Anti-Discrimination and Employment Law. \n 4   105.   Under this hiring system, even a Nobel Prize winner might not be \n 5   considered if they prioritized academic research over diversity initiatives. \n 6   106.   It is reasonable to infer that rejected applicants would recognize that \n 7   the public spectacle of bringing a lawsuit against Cornell would : i) almost \n 8   surely prevent such applicants from being hired by any other leading \n 9   university, almost all of which engage in similarly discriminatory practices; \n 10   and ii) be personally and professionally ostracized by the discriminatory \n 11   cultures existing at most leading US universities, research institutions, and \n 12   scholarly publications. For these reasons and to avoid self-harm, any \n 13   aspiring professor would be loath to become a plaintiff in such legal action \n 14   against Cornell – regardless if such litigation might be won or lost. Once \n 15   again, it clearly illustrates the importance of exercising the chilling effect \n 16   doctrine when it comes to the legal standing in lawsuits concerning \n 17   universities’ student admissions and faculty hiring. \n 18   107.   In an  open letter  dated Jan 23, 2024, Jon A. Lindseth, a member of \n 19   Cornell Board of Trustees (Emeritus) and Counselor to the President, \n 20   called for the resignation of Cornell’s president and provost, citing that \n 21   “Reports have been made of Cornell’s hiring faculty based on race rather \n 22   than academic merit (even in the pure sciences).” He also called to “return \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  30  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 31 of 147\n 1   Cornell to ‘merit based’ rather than ‘politically based’ or ‘identity based’ \n 2   hiring and admission preferences.” (See  Exhibit 57 . ) \n 3   E. Cornell’s Motive and Intent for Racial Balancing its Student Body \n 4   108.   The  amicus brief  that Cornell filed jointly with other universities to the \n 5   US Supreme Court in  SFFA v. Harvard  stated that “  Amici’s  experience has \n 6   demonstrated that the optimal means of creating a diverse student \n 7   body—and thereby achieving Amici’s educational objectives—involves a \n 8   limited consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions.  ” (See  Exhibit 58 ) . \n 9   The brief fails to define the criteria of a diverse student body—a point \n 10   Plaintiffs intend to explore during discovery. Nevertheless, the amicus brief \n 11   reveals Cornell’s intent to increase enrollment for certain racial groups, a \n 12   motive that implicates strict scrutiny under constitutional law. \n 13   109.   On June 29, 2023, following the Supreme Court’s ruling in  SFFA v. \n 14   Harvard  , Cornell President Martha E. Pollack stated  that “Cornell is \n 15   disappointed by the Supreme Court of the United States’ decision today” \n 16   (See  Exhibit 59 ) . This statement openly signaled the university’s continued \n 17   desire to consider race in admissions, despite the Court’s decision. While \n 18   President Pollack claims Cornell “to be a university where ‘any person can \n 19   find instruction in any study’”, Plaintiffs would like to question President \n 20   Pollack whether that applies to highly qualified Asian-American applicants \n 21   like Stanley. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  31  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 32 of 147\n 1   110.   The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits \n 2   states from denying any person “the equal protection of the laws.” The \n 3   Clause’s “central purpose is to prevent the States from purposefully \n 4   discriminating between individuals on the basis of race.” See  Shaw v. \n 5   Reno  , 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993). Thus, a state law  or policy that \n 6   discriminates on the basis of race is subject to strict scrutiny, regardless of \n 7   its intended beneficiaries. See  Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña  , 515 \n 8   U.S. 200, 227 (1995). \n 9   111.   As the Supreme Court noted in  SFFA v. Harvard ,  143 S. Ct. 2141, \n 10   2169 (2023), “College admissions are zero-sum. A benefit provided to \n 11   some applicants but not to others necessarily advantages the former \n 12   group at the expense of the latter.”  The distinction  between preferential \n 13   treatment and adverse impact is illusory—both actions are inherently \n 14   racially motivated and inseparable, representing merely different ways of \n 15   describing the same net discriminatory conduct. In a zero-sum situation, \n 16   when assessing whether a policy constitutes racial discrimination, courts \n 17   should focus on the presence of racial intent, regardless of whether that \n 18   intent manifests as preferential treatment or adverse impact. As the \n 19   Supreme Court affirmed in  SFFA v. Harvard  , “[W]hat  cannot be done \n 20   directly cannot be done indirectly. The Constitution deals with substance, \n 21   not shadows,\" and the prohibition against racial discrimination is \"levelled \n 22   at the thing, not the name.\"  Cummings v. Missouri  ,  71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 277, \n 23   325, 18 L.Ed. 356 (1867). \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  32  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 33 of 147\n 1   F. Cornell’s Action for Racial Balancing its Admissions \n 2   112.   In addition to its evident motive and intent for racial balancing, Cornell \n 3   possesses the means and opportunity to manipulate the racial \n 4   composition of its student body under its current “holistic” admissions \n 5   framework, which lacks transparency, independent third-party oversight \n 6   and accountability. Indeed, Cornell’s intent is matched by its actions. \n 7   113.   According to the 2020 U.S. Census, the New York state’s Asian \n 8   population grew by 36.1% over the prior decade, making it the \n 9   fastest-growing ethnic group in the state (See  Exhibit  60  ). Similarly, the \n 10   Asian population in the U.S. grew by 36% from 2010 to 2020, making it \n 11   also the fastest-growing ethnic group in the nation (See  Exhibit 60  as \n 12   well). It is reasonable to infer that the Asian population in the New York \n 13   state and the U.S. continued to grow at a similar pace after 2020. \n 14   However, at Cornell, Asian admits have trended flat from 2018 through \n 15   2023. The percentage of Asian students enrolled was 19.1%, 20.1%, \n 16   18.1%, 19.1%, 18.7%, 20.1% for those years, respectively. (See  Exhibit \n 17   61  .) \n 18   114.   The gap between Asian population growth and admission rates \n 19   strongly suggests systemic discrimination. As the Court explained in  Reno \n 20   v. Bossier Parish School Board  , 520 U.S. 471, 487  (1997), the natural \n 21   consequences of an action often provide probative evidence of intent. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  33  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 34 of 147\n 1   Here, the persistent adverse impact on Asian-American applicants \n 2   indicates a racially motivated policy, despite Cornell’s denials. \n 3   115.   Even before the Supreme Court’s 2023 ruling in  SFFA  v. Harvard  , the \n 4   use of race in student admissions, as permitted by Justice Kennedy’s \n 5   majority opinion in  Fisher II  (2016), was limited  to considering race as a \n 6   “factor of a factor of a factor” and within the context that “the contention \n 7   that the University discriminates against Asian-Americans is ‘entirely \n 8   unsupported by evidence in the record or empirical data’” (See  Exhibit 62  ). \n 9   However, the rejection of Stanley in 2023 casts serious doubt on whether \n 10   Cornell’s use of race adhered to the narrow boundaries established by \n 11   Fisher II .  \n 12   116.   For the first admission cycle after  SFFA v. Harvard,  Cornell’s Asian \n 13   enrollment grew from 19.2% (2018-2023 average. See  Exhibit 61  as well.) \n 14   to 22.4% in 2024, an increase of 16.7%. The magnitude of the increase \n 15   further raises serious doubt on whether Cornell’s use of race in and before \n 16   2023 adhered to the narrow boundaries established by  Fisher II  as a \n 17   “factor of a factor of a factor”. \n 18   117.   Cornell insists on implementing both “holistic reviews” and a \n 19   “test-recommended” admissions policy. According to Cornell  Office of \n 20   Undergraduate Admissions  , “  Cornell will be test-recommended  for \n 21   students applying in fall 2024 to enroll for fall 2025. This means that \n 22   submitting test scores is not required but recommended for applicants to \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  34  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 35 of 147\n 1   the College of Arts & Sciences; Cornell Engineering; College of Human \n 2   Ecology; Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy; and School of \n 3   Industrial and Labor Relations.  ” However, this position  is inherently \n 4   contradictory. A review cannot be truly holistic if it deliberately excludes \n 5   objective measures like standardized tests, especially for STEM \n 6   applicants where such metrics are crucial for assessing academic \n 7   preparedness. This decision appears to be a calculated move to \n 8   compromise intellectual honesty and academic integrity, potentially \n 9   facilitating the concealment of discriminatory practices against \n 10   Asian-American applicants. Notably, leading institutions like MIT, \n 11   Dartmouth, Yale, Brown, Harvard, Caltech, and the University of Texas at \n 12   Austin have reinstated standardized testing, further highlighting the \n 13   questionable nature of Cornell’s “test-recommended” policy post-COVID. \n 14   These circumstances necessitate legal scrutiny of Cornell’s policy, its \n 15   underlying motivations, its disparate impact on Asian-American applicants, \n 16   and whether Cornell continues to merit the traditional judicial deference \n 17   granted to bona fide academic institutions. \n 18   118.   In 2023, the year Stanley applied in, Cornell enrolled 214 African \n 19   American students (See  Exhibit 63  as well). The 25th percentile SAT \n 20   scores for Cornell students were 1420 (See  Exhibit 64  as well). Nationally, \n 21   225,954 African American students took the SAT in 2023, with \n 22   approximately 1% (roughly 2,259 students) scoring in the 1400–1600 \n 23   range (See  Exhibit 65 ) . If Cornell’s African American enrollees reflected \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  35  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 36 of 147\n 1   the general SAT distribution of Cornell students, approximately 161 \n 2   (214*75%) of them would have scored above the 25th percentile of 1420, \n 3   with an even larger number exceeding 1400. This would mean Cornell \n 4   enrolled about 7.1% (161/2259) of the nation’s top African American SAT \n 5   performers. \n 6   119.   Using this analysis, the estimated percentage of national top scorers \n 7   enrolled at Cornell is approximately 7.1% for African Americans, 1.0% for \n 8   Asian Americans, 4.1% for Hispanic Americans, and 1.9% for White \n 9   students (See  Exhibit 66 ) . \n 10   120.   Given the geographic distribution of high-achieving students, such a \n 11   high concentration of top scorers from certain racial groups appears \n 12   statistically improbable. These figures suggest that Asian-American \n 13   applicants face significantly higher SAT score thresholds for admission \n 14   compared to other racial groups. While SAT scores are not the sole \n 15   measure of merit, this statistical irregularity raises serious concerns about \n 16   whether Cornell’s admissions policies comply with constitutional and legal \n 17   prohibitions or limits against racial preferences. \n 18   121.   Cornell does not publish the number of National Merit Finalists in its \n 19   admissions data. If such information were available, it would help evaluate \n 20   whether rejecting Stanley—a National Merit Finalist—was reasonable. \n 21   122.   Given that Cornell is or was not conducting itself as a bona fide \n 22   academic institution for student admissions or faculty hiring, any traditional \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  36  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 37 of 147\n 1   judicial deference afforded to academic institutions should not apply in \n 2   lawsuits concerning student admissions or faculty hiring at Cornell. \n 3   123.   Studies comparing the academic qualifications of admitted students by \n 4   race fail to fully capture the extent of racial discrimination faced by \n 5   Asian-American applicants. By rejecting highly qualified Asian-American \n 6   applicants like Stanley, Cornell artificially narrows the academic \n 7   qualification gap between admitted students of different racial groups. As \n 8   a matter of mathematical fact, the more highly qualified Asian-American \n 9   applicants the university rejects, the smaller the observed qualification gap \n 10   among admitted students becomes. To accurately assess the extent of \n 11   racial discrimination, it is necessary to compare not only the admitted \n 12   Asian-American students but also the rejected Asian-American applicants \n 13   against admitted students from other racial groups. However, limitations in \n 14   the publicly available Cornell admissions data currently prevent such an \n 15   analysis. The plaintiffs intend to pursue this essential data comparison \n 16   during the discovery phase of this lawsuit. \n 17   124.   The argument that Asian Americans are over-represented in Cornell’s \n 18   student body relative to the general population does not negate claims of \n 19   discrimination. Equal protection requires that individuals be treated as \n 20   individuals, not as members of a racial class. See  Miller v. Johnson ,  515 \n 21   U.S. 900, 911 (1995). Even if aggregate Asian enrollment remains \n 22   relatively high, systemic bias may suppress their numbers below what \n 23   they would be in a race-neutral system. “[I]nvidious discrimination does \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  37  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 38 of 147\n 1   not become less so because the discrimination accomplished is of a \n 2   lesser magnitude.” See  Personnel Administrator of Massachusetts v. \n 3   Feeney  , 442 U.S. 256, 277 (1979). \n 4   125.   A university policy that amounts to racial balancing is “patently \n 5   unconstitutional.”  Grutter v. Bollinger ,  539 U.S.  306, 329 (2003). Racial \n 6   balancing seeks to ensure a specified percentage of a racial group within \n 7   the student body merely due to race or ethnicity.  Id.  Courts have \n 8   consistently rejected proportional representation as a constitutional \n 9   justification for race-based admissions. See  Id.  at  343. \n 10   126.   The Second Circuit’s 2024 decision in  Chinese American Citizens \n 11   Alliance of Greater New York (CACAGNY) v. Adams  supports  this case. \n 12   The court held that a facially neutral policy driven by racial motives \n 13   violates equal protection, even if aggregate enrollment improves. The \n 14   ruling states “if discriminatory intent is proven, a negative effect or harm \n 15   from that discriminatory policy on individual Asian-American students \n 16   applying to the SHSs [Specialized High Schools] would be sufficient to \n 17   trigger strict scrutiny review”. The court further held that a policy or a \n 18   program “is not immunized from strict scrutiny because it underperforms in \n 19   an unconstitutional mission with respect to a targeted racial group in the \n 20   aggregate.” Therefore, university policies aiming to suppress Asian \n 21   enrollment—whether or not Asian Americans are over-represented—are \n 22   subject to strict scrutiny and won't survive it. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  38  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 39 of 147\n 1   127.   Moreover,  CACAGNY  rejected the defense that admitting students to \n 2   any school within a system negates discrimination claims. The Second \n 3   Circuit Court stated that denying a student access to their preferred \n 4   institution due to race is actionable. Similarly, admitting Asian-American \n 5   students to less selective Cornell campuses does not absolve more \n 6   selective campuses from discrimination claims. \n 7   128.   In  CACAGNY ,  the Second Circuit Court stated that “Applying Supreme \n 8   Court precedent, we have generally recognized three types of \n 9   discriminatory laws: (1) a facially discriminatory law or policy that \n 10   expressly classifies individuals on the basis of race; (2) a facially neutral \n 11   law that is enforced in a discriminatory fashion; and (3) a facially neutral \n 12   law that was adopted with discriminatory intent and resulted in a \n 13   discriminatory effect.  See Chabad Lubavitch of Litchfield  Cnty., Inc. v. \n 14   Litchfield Hist. Dist. Comm'n,  768 F.3d 183, 199 (2d  Cir. 2014).” \n 15   129.   In this case, at least two types of discriminatory policies and practices \n 16   identified by the Second Circuit Court are evident: \n 17   a.   Discriminatory enforcement :  Cornell’s absurd and incongruous \n 18   admission outcomes strongly indicate that Cornell exercises its \n 19   admissions policies in a discriminatory fashion. \n 20   b.   Discriminatory intent and effect:  The pervasive culture  of \n 21   \"unstated affirmative action\" at universities underscores \n 22   discriminatory intent, with substantial evidence of its adverse \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  39  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 40 of 147\n 1   impact on Asian-American applicants, both individually and \n 2   collectively. \n 3   These actions constitute violations of the Equal Protection Clause of the \n 4   Fourteenth Amendment, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \n 5   G. Cornell Ignoring Complaints \n 6   130.   Cornell officials have ignored complaints about questionable \n 7   admissions outcomes and allegations of racial discrimination, reflecting a \n 8   broader lack of transparency and accountability in their admissions \n 9   process. On January 31, 2025, Nan contacted the Cornell Board of \n 10   Trustees regarding Stanley’s admission results, requesting an \n 11   investigation. As of this filing, they have not responded. \n 12   131.   This mirrors the University of California’s prolonged refusal to engage \n 13   with Nan, who sought dialogue for over a year before filing a lawsuit \n 14   against UC and the U.S. Department of Education on February 11, 2025, \n 15   in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California (Case No. \n 16   2:25-cv-0495). \n 17   132.   The denial of Stanley’s application to Cornell—combined with Cornell’s \n 18   complete failure to even acknowledge the issue—cannot be dismissed as \n 19   mere random error. Rather, these actions reveal a pattern of systemic bias \n 20   and deliberate indifference, suggesting malice toward Stanley and, by \n 21   extension, other similarly situated Asian-American applicants. While it is \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  40  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 41 of 147\n 1   true that Google’s job offer came after Cornell’s rejection—meaning \n 2   Cornell could not have foreseen that Google would recognize Stanley’s \n 3   skills had already reached the Ph.D. level—the fundamental issue \n 4   remains: the technical achievements included in Stanley’s Cornell \n 5   applications were substantially the same as those sent to Google. While \n 6   Google found Stanley's achievements sufficient to consider him for a \n 7   Ph.D.-level position, Cornell, in contrast, deemed him unqualified for \n 8   undergraduate admission. This stark contrast underscores a systemic \n 9   barrier that profoundly affects Asian-American applicants’ experiences in \n 10   college admissions. Even when their qualifications reach the Ph.D. level, \n 11   they may still be denied undergraduate admission. This fosters a \n 12   pervasive sense of helplessness—the belief that the system is rigged to \n 13   reject you regardless of your merits—that contributes significantly to the \n 14   mental health challenges within the Asian-American youth community. \n 15   133.   This case echoes the dark legacy of the Chinese Exclusion Act of \n 16   1882—a shameful chapter in our nation's history for which Congress \n 17   formally apologized in June 2012. Disturbingly, as of the filing of this \n 18   lawsuit—after Cornell became aware of Google’s assessment of Stanley’s \n 19   skills—Cornell still refuses to engage in any meaningful discussion about \n 20   his applications, which only compounded the emotional distress Stanley \n 21   and Nan have endured. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  41  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 42 of 147\n 1   H. Lack of Response by Government Officials \n 2   134.   Stanley’s mother filed a civil rights complaint with the Office for Civil \n 3   Rights (OCR) at the U.S. Department of Education. However, the OCR \n 4   dismissed the case after misinterpreting her email, relying on reasoning \n 5   that directly contradicted her intended meaning. When she pointed out the \n 6   misunderstanding, the OCR refused to reopen the case, stating it had \n 7   been closed. The official dismissal letter cited a rationale the OCR knew to \n 8   be false. Despite her repeated requests to correct the letter and remove \n 9   the inaccurate reasoning, the OCR declined to make any changes, even \n 10   after she escalated the matter. (For the full record of email exchanges with \n 11   the OCR, see Exhibit 75 in case 2:25-cv-0495 in the U.S. District Court for \n 12   the Eastern District of California.) OCR’s failure to enforce civil rights laws \n 13   has let the direct harm to Stanley and other Asian-American applicants \n 14   persist. \n 15   135.   Nan also raised his concerns with California Assemblymember Marc \n 16   Berman, mentioning that hundreds of his constituents were deeply \n 17   concerned about UC’s admissions practices. Despite several email \n 18   exchanges, Mr. Berman did not respond substantively. (For the full record \n 19   of email exchanges with Mr. Berman and his staff, see Exhibit 76 in case \n 20   2:25-cv-0495 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of \n 21   California.) \n 22   136.   In November 2023, Nan organized a petition that gathered over 4,000 \n 23   endorsements for letters expressing concerns about UC admissions. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  42  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 43 of 147\n 1   These letters were sent to Governor Gavin Newsom and Lt. Governor \n 2   Eleni Kounalakis, both of whom serve as ex officio Regents of the \n 3   University of California. Neither replied. (For the letters, see Exhibit 77 and \n 4   Exhibit 78 in case 2:25-cv-0495 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \n 5   District of California.) \n 6   137.   Since Plaintiffs were unable to get government officials to engage in \n 7   California, where they are residents and taxpayers, they have little reason \n 8   to expect assistance from officials for admissions issues at a private \n 9   university in New York. As a result, litigation remains the only viable \n 10   option. \n 11   I. Legal Basis \n 12   138.   The Supreme Court’s decision in  SFFA v. Harvard  unequivocally \n 13   established that racial discrimination in college admissions is \n 14   unconstitutional. Even before this decision, the Court’s ruling in  Fisher II \n 15   had already imposed strict limitations, allowing race to be considered only \n 16   as “a factor of a factor of a factor” in admissions decisions. \n 17   139.   Cornell’s racial discriminatory admission policies and practices violate \n 18   the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United \n 19   States Constitution. \n 20   140.   Cornell’s racial discriminatory admissions policies and practices also \n 21   violate Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits racial \n 22   discrimination in programs receiving federal financial assistance. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  43  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 44 of 147\n 1   141.   In addition to direct evidence of discrimination, racial “prejudice or \n 2   stereotype” may be proven through circumstantial evidence.  See Village of \n 3   Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.,  429 U.S. \n 4   252, 266 (1977). \n 5   142.   Further supporting this claim, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in \n 6   Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York (CACAGNY) v. \n 7   Adams  , 116 F.4th 161 (2d Cir. 2024), unanimously affirmed  that an equal \n 8   protection claim may proceed if “any individual has been negatively \n 9   affected or harmed by a discriminatory law or policy based on race, even if \n 10   there is no disparate impact on members of that racial class in the \n 11   aggregate.” Under the principle of  stare decisis  ,  this ruling provides \n 12   binding authority for the present lawsuit. \n 13  V. CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n 14  COUNT   I   -   Violation   of   the   Fourteenth   Amendment   (Equal   Protection \n 15  Clause) \n 16   143.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \n 17   above. \n 18   144.   Defendant’s admissions policies and practices violate the Equal \n 19   Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by discriminating against \n 20   Asian-American applicants, including Stanley, on the basis of race. \n Zhong & SWORD v. Cornell University   Page  44  of  147 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-00365-ECC-ML     Document 1     Filed 03/22/25     Page 45 of 147\n 1   145.   As a result of Defendant’s discriminatory policies and practices, \n 2   Plaintiffs have suffered harm, including the loss of educational \n 3   opportunities, emotional distress, and reputational damage. \n 4   146.   Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be injured by Defendant’s \n 5   ongoing discriminatory admissions policies, which deny them an equal \n 6   opportunity to compete for admission based on race or ethnicity. \n 7   147.   Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n 8   §2201, and a permanent injunction because there is no plain, adequate, or \n 9   speedy remedy at law to prevent Defendant from continuing to use \n 10   admissions policies and practices that discriminate on the basis of race or \n 11   ethnicity in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and because the harm \n 12   Plaintiffs will otherwise continue to suffer is irreparable. \n 13  COUNT  II  -  Violation  of  Title  VI  of  the  Civil  Rights  Act  of  1964  (42  U.S.C.  § \n 14  2000d) \n 15   148.   Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth \n 16   above. \n 17   149.   Defendant receives federal financial assistance and is therefore \n 18   subject to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits \n 19   discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin in any program \n 20   or activity receiving federal financial assistance.

As a result of Defendant’s discriminatory policies and practices, \n 4   Plaintiffs have suffered harm, including the loss of educational \n 5   opportunities, emotional distress, and reputational damage. \n 6   151.   Plaintiffs have been and will continue to be injured by Defendant’s \n 7   ongoing discriminatory admissions policies, which deny them an equal \n 8   opportunity to compete for admission based on race or ethnicity. \n 9   152.   Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaratory judgment, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n 10   §2201, and a permanent injunction because there is no plain, adequate, or \n 11   speedy remedy at law to prevent Defendant from continuing to use \n 12   admissions policies and practices that discriminate on the basis of race or \n 13   ethnicity in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and because \n 14   the harm Plaintiffs will otherwise continue to suffer is irreparable. \n 15  VI.

Harvard \n 12   (2023) or in violation of the narrow limitations on race-based \n 13   considerations established in  Fisher II  (2016) or  earlier. \n 14   c.   Issue an injunction requiring Defendant to dismiss, following a full \n 15   and fair public hearing, all administrators who knowingly defend this \n 16   lawsuit despite being aware of racial preferences in admissions—if \n 17   excessive before 2023—or in hiring. \n 18   d.   Issue an injunction requiring Defendant to dismiss, after a full and \n 19   fair public hearing, all administrators who knowingly certified \n 20   compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws while being aware \n 21   of racial preferences in admissions—if excessive before 2023—or \n 22   hiring. \n Zhong & SWORD v.

Refer individuals who knowingly made false certifications under \n 2   penalty of perjury for criminal prosecution. \n 3   155.   Mandate Oversight & Transparency in Admissions at Cornell \n 4   a.   Issue a permanent injunction requiring Defendant to establish an \n 5   independent admissions oversight board, approved by this Court, \n 6   with sole authority over the hiring and firing of Admissions Directors \n 7   at each Cornell campus. \n 8   b.

Issue a permanent injunction requiring Defendant to implement \n 13   admissions procedures that prevent personnel from accessing or \n 14   inferring an applicant’s race or ethnicity. \n 15   d.   Issue a permanent injunction requiring Defendant to implement \n 16   hiring procedures that prevent personnel from accessing or \n 17   inferring a candidate’s race or ethnicity. \n 18   e.   Require Defendant to repeat its admission process independently \n 19   on a small group of randomly chosen applicants for each admission \n 20   cycle in order to demonstrate repeatability and self-consistency in \n 21   admissions decisions. \n 22   156.

Require annual 14th Amendment and Title VI & Title VII training for \n 2   all Cornell personnel involved in admissions or hiring. \n 3   b.   Require all trained personnel to explicitly acknowledge that violating \n 4   14th Amendment, Title VI or Title VII, or failing to report violations \n 5   may result in disciplinary action, including termination. \n 6   157.   Declare Judicial Scrutiny of Cornell’s Academic Policies \n 7   a.   Declare that Defendant should no longer receive traditional judicial \n 8   deference as a bona fide academic institution unless it: \n 9   i.   Collects standardized test scores from all applicants in its \n 10   admission process, \n 11   ii.   Ceases prioritizing immutable characteristics over academic \n 12   merit in admissions and hiring. \n 13   158.   Award Monetary Damages & Attorney’s Fees \n 14   a.   Award nominal, compensatory, and punitive damages to Plaintiffs. \n 15   b.

Our code can be found on GitHub here \n 14  and  here .  \n 15 \n 16  We found out about the COBOL Cowboys on the news and saw the work you are \n 17  doing to help people with their COBOL programs. If possible, we would like to \n 18  help. Would you be interested in us doing volunteer work for you? \n 19 \n 20  As a matter of disclosure, we are both 14 years old, but ready and eager to help \n 21  the world in any way we can. \n 22 \n 23  YYY and Stanley \n Zhong & SWORD v.

Good work guys. \n 15 \n 16  We (Bill Hinshaw, Founder and myself) are intrigued by your interest and would \n 17  like to have further discussions with both of you. \n 18 \n 19  An important next step, given your ages, would be to make contact with a \n 20  parent/guardian. I will need to talk to them on the phone and also get an OK in \n 21  writing (a quick email is fine) with their written approval for Cobol Cowboys, LLC, \n 22  to have an introductory teleconference with you both as well as follow-up emails. \n 23 \n Zhong & SWORD v.

I am available today: \n 3  now until 7pm and tomorrow through Friday, from 9am to 1pm. \n 4 \n 5  Please let me know the name of your parent/guardian that will be calling with an \n 6  approximate time of their call. \n 7 \n 8  Bill Hinshaw and I look forward to possible future discussions pertaining to \n 9  COBOL. \n 10 \n 11  XXX, COO \n 12  Cobol Cowboys, LLC \n 13  Cell: xxx-xxx-xxxx \n 14  Email: XXX@cobolcowboys.com \n 15 \n 16  not our first rodeo ... \n 17 \n 18 \n 19 \n 20  Nan Zhong <nanzhong1@gmail.com>   Tue, May 26, 2020 at 11:31 PM \n 21  To: XXX <XXX@cobolcowboys.com> \n 22  Cc: Stanley, YYY@YYY.com \n 23 \n Zhong & SWORD v.

Thanks for your quick response to the boys! I know Stanley \n 4  was excited to see it. \n 5 \n 6  Yes, please accept this email as the written approval for Cobol Cowboys, LLC, to \n 7  have an introductory teleconference with Stanley as well as follow-up emails. I \n 8  am sure you will hear from YYY’s parent soon as well. \n 9 \n 10  BTW, summer coding job is nothing new to Stanley. He interned at my startup in \n 11  2018, and programmed (in Python) the backend service (on AWS) that \n 12  automatically runs insurance quotes. These days he is very much into \n 13  competitive programming (mostly in C++) and computer security contests. \n 14 \n 15  YYY and Stanley are school friends. Both live the Bay Area, CA. Based on the \n 16  NPR news story, I believe you live in Gainesville, Texas, 2 hours ahead of us. If \n 17  that is correct, can I call you at 11am your time (9am my time) on Wednesday \n 18  5/27? I will call from my mobile number xxx-xxx-xxxx. \n 19 \n 20  Looking forward to speaking with you! \n 21 \n 22  Thanks, \n 23  Nan \n Zhong & SWORD v.
