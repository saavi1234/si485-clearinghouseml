    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s (EPA) termination and withholding of grant funds awarded to the Justice Climate Fund (JCF), a nonprofit created to apply for and deploy funding for clean energy and affordable housing projects in disadvantaged communities. This case is related to the case <em>Climate United Fund v. Citibank </em>(1:25-cv-00698), which the Clearinghouse is covering <a href=\"../../../../case/46274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>. (To view the Clearinghouse&rsquo;s coverage of environmental protection-related cases against the second Trump administration, click <a href=\"../../../../collections/38760\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 31, 2025, JCF sued EPA, EPA administrators, and Citibank, N.A. in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. JCF&rsquo;s legal claims were grounded in the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Constitution&rsquo;s Appropriations Clause and Due Process Clause, and federal contract law.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>JCF was awarded $940 million in 2024 through the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA), an initiative of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) created by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. According to the complaint, JCF's award agreement with EPA and associated financial controls&mdash;including a Financial Agent Agreement (FAA) between Citibank and the U.S. Treasury, and an Account Control Agreement (ACA) involving Citibank, JCF, and EPA&mdash;strictly limited the grounds on which EPA could terminate funding. The agreement allowed termination only in cases of (1) substantial noncompliance, (2) material misrepresentation of eligibility, or (3) &ldquo;Waste, Fraud, or Abuse&rdquo; defined as violations of specific federal criminal or civil laws. The ACA required Citibank to disburse funds to JCF unless the EPA had issued a formal &ldquo;Notice of Exclusive Control&rdquo; based on those conditions of termination&mdash;something EPA did not do.</p>\r\n<p>JCF learned in late February 2025 that Citibank had stopped processing JCF&rsquo;s disbursement requests. JCF alleged that EPA orchestrated an unlawful pressure campaign to reclaim GGRF funds from JCF and other recipients. The campaign allegedly included coordination with the Department of Justice and the FBI, which unsuccessfully sought a seizure warrant and requested Citibank freeze accounts. On March 11, 2025, EPA issued JCF a &ldquo;Notice of Termination,&rdquo; citing concerns with &ldquo;program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency&rsquo;s priorities&rdquo; without identifying any factual misconduct or legal violation by JCF.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was filed amid a broader series of lawsuits, collectively known as the &ldquo;<em>Climate United </em>Litigation,&rdquo; involving other terminated GGRF recipients. A temporary restraining order (TRO) was granted in that related litigation, barring EPA from transferring funds or enforcing terminations pending further review. JCF stated that EPA had agreed not to touch its funds at Citibank while the TRO remained in effect.</p>\r\n<p>JCF argued that EPA&rsquo;s termination was arbitrary, capricious, and illegal under the APA and that Citibank had breached the ACA by freezing the funds without a lawful directive. Represented by law firm Zimmer, Citron &amp; Clarke, JCF sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including an order restoring access to its funds, blocking the EPA from enforcing its termination of JCF&rsquo;s grant, and requiring Citibank to honor JCF&rsquo;s disbursement requests. The case was assigned to District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 2, 2025, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On April 10, 2025, the defendants filed a joint motion to consolidate this case \"with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) cases already consolidated under Civ. Action No. 1:25-cv-00698,\" <em>Climate United Fund v. Citibank. </em>On April 15, the court granted the motion&mdash;thus, consolidating the cases. From April 15 forward, this case has been consolidated with<em> Climate United Fund v. Citibank </em>(1:25-cv-00698), which the Clearinghouse is covering <a href=\"../../../../case/46274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>, and all further filings and proceedings will happen under the docket of the&nbsp;<em>Climate United Fund</em> case. Accordingly, the court denied as moot the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, noting in its order, \"See Preliminary Injunction Order and forthcoming Memorandum Opinion in lead case No. 25-cv-698 for details.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

McIntosh, in his official capacity as \nActing  Deputy  Administrator  of  EPA;  and  Citibank,  N.A.  (“Citibank”)  (collectively, \n“Defendants”).  \nJCF moves for a preliminary injunction to enjoin EPA, Administrator Zeldin, and Deputy \nAdministrator  McIntosh,  and  others  in  active  concert  or  participation  therewith,  from:  (1) \neffectuating EPA’s March 11, 2025 “Notice of Termination” as to JCF; (2) unlawfully suspending \nor terminating JCF’s grant award, including by issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control, effectuating \nthe Notice of Termination, or limiting access to funds in accounts established in connection with \nJCF’s grant, except as permitted in accordance with the applicable Account Control Agreement \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938-TSC     Document 7     Filed 04/02/25     Page 2 of 3\n(“ACA”) with Citibank, the grant awards, and applicable law; or (3) directly or indirectly impeding \nCitibank or causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise limit access to funds in accounts \nestablished in connection with JCF’s grant, except as permitted under the terms of the applicable \nACA, grant award, and applicable law. \nJCF also seeks a preliminary injunction enjoining Defendant Citibank from (1) violating \nits obligations under JCF’s ACA, including by failing to process, disburse, and release funds in \naccounts established in connection with JCF’s grant, in accordance with JCF’s ACA, both with \nrespect to requests already submitted and future requests; and (2) transferring or otherwise moving \nfunds out of accounts established in connection with JCF’s grant, except at the direction of JCF or \nits subgrantees, as permitted under the applicable ACA. \nAs  set forth  in more detail in  the  accompanying  Memorandum  of Law,  and  in  the \nMemorandum of Law filed by plaintiffs in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, No. 25-cv-698 in \nsupport of their motion for a preliminary injunction (Dkt. 33-1), JCF has a strong likelihood of \nsuccess on its claim that EPA’s actions are arbitrary and capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act.  JCF also has a \nstrong likelihood of success on its claim that EPA’s actions violate the Appropriations and Due \nProcess Clauses of the U.S. Constitution.  In addition, JCF has a strong likelihood of success on \nits claim against Citibank for breach of contract.  A preliminary injunction is appropriate because \nJCF faces irreparable harm if it does not obtain injunctive relief to enjoin Defendants’ unlawful \nconduct; the injury to JCF outweighs any harm to Defendants from an injunction; and the public \ninterest is best served by requiring Defendants to stop preventing access to funds in accounts \nestablished in connection with JCF’s grant. \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938-TSC     Document 7     Filed 04/02/25     Page 3 of 3\nDated: April 2, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n          /s/ Eric Citron \nEric F.

McIntosh, in his official \ncapacity as EPA Acting Deputy Administrator (together with EPA and Mr. Zeldin, “EPA \nDefendants”), and Citibank, N.A. (“Citi”),  alleges as follows: \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  This case seeks to vindicate the right of Plaintiff Justice Climate Fund (“JCF”) to \naccess award funds to which it is legally entitled.  EPA, through its purported “Notice of \nTermination,” has unlawfully attempted to withhold those funds, and JCF seeks to enjoin that \nongoing, unlawful action. The facts alleged and claims asserted herein are materially identical to \nthose asserted in four consolidated cases already pending in this District: Climate United Fund v. \nCitibank, N.A., No. 25-cv-698-TSC (filed Mar. 8, 2025); Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, \nN.A., No. 25-cv-735-TSC (filed Mar. 12, 2025); Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank, \nN.A., No. 25-cv-762-TSC (filed Mar. 14, 2025); and California Infrastructure and Economic \nDevelopment Bank v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-cv-820 (filed March 19, 2025) (collectively, the \n“Climate United Litigation”). \n2.  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”), Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818, \namended the Clean Air Act to authorize EPA to make competitive grants under the Greenhouse \nGas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”) to provide financial assistance for “the rapid deployment of low- \nand  zero-emission  products,  technologies,  and  services.”  42  U.S.C.  §  7434(c)(1).  EPA \nimplemented GGRF through three different programs:  The National Clean Investment Fund \n(“NCIF”), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (“CCIA”), and Solar for All. The \nClimate United Litigation Plaintiffs were grantees under the NCIF program. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 3 of 133\n3.  While structured similarly to the NCIF program, the CCIA program differs in one \nkey way: Rather than awarding money directly to large lenders, the CCIA program provides grants \nto  nonprofit  organizations  that  provide  funding  and  technical  assistance  to  much  smaller, \ncommunity lenders working in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the country. In \nother words, unlike the NCIF grant recipients, the CCIA grant recipients do not themselves invest \nthe money but instead provide capitalization funding and technical assistance to community \nlenders to deploy in connection with proposed distributed energy, net-zero buildings, and zero-\nemissions transportation projects where they are needed most.  \n4.  JCF is a purpose-built, non-profit organization that was founded to apply for CCIA \nfunding on behalf of a consortium of community lender representatives.  JCF’s mission is to ensure \nthat community lenders have the resources to provide affordable financing for clean-energy and \naffordable-housing-related qualified projects across the country, focusing on low-income and \ndisadvantaged communities in unbanked areas.  \n5.  On October 12, 2023, JCF applied for a funding award from CCIA. In April 2024, \nJCF was awarded CCIA funding after a rigorous, competitive, and merit-based review of JCF’s \napplication. JCF did not have any relationship with anyone inside EPA or, to its knowledge, with \nany reviewers during the application and selection process. Since being announced as a selectee, \nJCF has negotiated with EPA a comprehensive program to train and provide grants to community \nlenders within its network.  For example, in its first solicitation, JCF received applications from \n94 community lenders, selected 35 qualified projects, and committed $248.5 million of its $940 \nmillion award. The committed funds will provide capitalization funding and technical assistance \ngrants  to  community  lenders,  whose  qualified  projects  in  unbanked,  low-income,  and \ndisadvantaged communities will advance community health, security, and prosperity. A core \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 4 of 133\ncommitment of JCF is to mobilize private capital for these projects, bringing needed capital to \ncommunities that have not benefitted from the scaled, lower-cost support that more prosperous \ncommunities routinely enjoy. \n6.  JCF’s Award Agreement  is  governed  by  a  twin  set  of  detailed  “Terms  and \nConditions,” consisting of award-specific CCIA Terms and Conditions and general EPA Terms and \nConditions issued by EPA on October 1, 2024. As most relevant here, the operative CCIA Terms \nand Conditions specify that EPA can only terminate JCF’s award if one of three conditions is met: \n(1) if JCF engages in “substantial” noncompliance such that “effective performance” is “Materially \nImpaired”; (2) if JCF engages in “material misrepresentation of eligibility status”; and (3) for \n“Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined in the CCIA Terms and Conditions as requiring a \nviolation of either Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity \nviolations or the civil False Claims Act. The Terms and Conditions do not permit termination for \nany other reason. \n7.  JCF’s award requires that JCF’s CCIA funds be held at Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”), \nunder a Financial Agent Agreement (“FAA”) between Citibank and the U.S. Treasury Department, \nand an Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between and among Citibank (as custodian), JCF (as \nPledgor and asset owner), and EPA (as the holder of a security interest in JCF’s funds).  \n8.  EPA  designed,  structured,  and  negotiated  the  FAA  and  the ACA  to  provide \ntransparency and accountability and to protect EPA’s interests. The FAA requires that Citibank \nprovide online access to EPA personnel “to allow full account visibility” into each account.1  And \n \n1 Pursuant to the March 12, 2025, sealing order in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-\ncv-698-TSC, JCF quotes only those portions of the FAA quoted in Citibank’s publicly filed \nopposition to Climate United’s motion for a temporary restraining order in that case, see id., Dkt. \nNo. 14 (Mar. 12, 2025).  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 5 of 133\nthe federal regulations that provide for a bank’s appointment as a “Financial Agent[] of the Federal \nGovernment,” 31 C.F.R. § 202.1, require Citibank to “pledge collateral security in the amount \nrequired by the Secretary of the Treasury,” id. § 202.6; see id. § 202.3. Citibank’s collateral \noperates to protect EPA from any misuse of the award funds. \n9.  The terms of the ACA are, as relevant to this case, straightforward. Section 2 of the \nACA requires that Citibank honor JCF’s withdrawal requests unless Citibank has received a written \n“Notice of Exclusive Control” from EPA, copied to JCF. Further, the ACA only allows EPA to \nissue a written Notice of Exclusive Control and assume that “exclusive control” over the funds \nunder specified conditions: (a) if EPA finds that JCF has engaged in “substantial” noncompliance \nwith the Terms and Conditions of the award; (b) if EPA finds “adequate evidence” of “Waste, \nFraud, or Abuse,” defined as “credible evidence” of a violation of federal criminal law or the False \nClaims Act; or (c) if EPA finds that JCF made a “material misrepresentation of eligibility status.” \nThe ACA also specifies the procedure that EPA must follow to take exclusive control of the \nfunds—namely, delivering a written “Notice of Exclusive Control” with a “written determination \nand finding” that JCF has triggered one of the three grounds for terminating the award. To date, \nJCF has not received a written Notice of Exclusive Control. \n10.  On or about February 25 and 26, 2025, JCF learned that Citibank had unexpectedly \nbegun  refusing  to  process  JCF’s  disbursement  requests,  despite  Citibank’s  unambiguous \ncontractual obligation to do so under the ACA (given that no Notice of Exclusive Control had been \ndelivered). This left JCF unable to access its award funds and thus to execute on its obligations \nunder the Award Agreement. Given that JCF is a purpose-built non-profit created specifically to \napply for, manage, and execute on its CCIA award, its lack of access to its funds at Citibank puts \nits operation—and its obligations to execute on the Award Agreement—at immediate risk. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 6 of 133\n11.  It has subsequently become clear that Citibank’s failure to meet its ACA-related \ncontractual obligations was not voluntary, but was rather the result of an extended and unlawful \npressure campaign by EPA. As alleged in more detail below, EPA has in multiple ways sought to \nconfiscate or take back JCF’s award funds without even attempting to demonstrate that any of the \nconditions have been met for terminating the award or taking control of the funds in JCF’s Citibank \naccount. As a culmination of EPA’s unlawful attempt to seize JCF’s award funds, EPA served JCF, \non March 11, 2025, with a purported “Notice of Termination”—one that JCF understands has been \nprovided to all NCIF and CCIA recipients. The “Notice of Termination” claimed that EPA was \nterminating the award based on EPA’s “authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40, the General Terms \nand Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement, and the Agency’s inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new \ninformation.” The “Notice” also mentioned EPA’s priorities and interest in transparency and \noversight. Tellingly, however, the “Notice” did not say anything about JCF, and did not provide \nany legal or factual basis to believe that the Award Agreement termination conditions or the ACA \nNotice of Exclusive Control conditions had been satisfied.  \n12.  EPA’s “Notice of Termination” was illegal for numerous reasons. It violated EPA’s \nown regulations, which did not permit EPA to terminate JCF’s award based on generic assertions \nof  priorities,  transparency,  and  oversight.  It  violated  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act,  the \nAppropriations Clause, and bedrock separation-of-powers principles by nullifying a duly enacted \nstatute purely because the Administrator disagreed with it. And it was arbitrary and capricious in \nthat it made vague accusations of waste, fraud, and abuse, with nothing to back up those \naccusations. Not one of EPA’s documents, public statements, or investigations has identified \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 7 of 133\nanything JCF has done that is improper at all, much less something that meets the requirements \nfor terminating the award. \n13.  Citibank’s refusals to honor JCF’s withdrawal requests, while an understandable \nresponse to enormous government pressure, are also unlawful. Until Citibank receives a lawful \nNotice of Exclusive Control, the ACA requires that Citibank honor JCF’s requests to draw money \nfrom its account. The purported “Notice of Termination” is no basis for Citibank to disregard JCF’s \nrequests because that Notice is itself illegal and must be enjoined. Nor is the FAA, which allows \nCitibank to fail to transfer JCF’s assets to JCF only “in accordance with” the ACA, and only in \nresponse  to  “lawful  instructions”  from  EPA.  Here,  Citi’s  decision  not  to  respond  to  JCF’s \nwithdrawal requests was not “in accordance with” the ACA and there were no “lawful instructions” \nfrom EPA or any other agency.  \n14.  EPA’s and Citibank’s unlawful actions are causing JCF to suffer real and immediate \nharm. JCF is a purpose-built non-profit created to apply for and execute on its CCIA award. JCF \nand the network of community lenders that JCF supports with capitalization funding grants and \ntechnical assistance grants do not have, and could not reasonably be expected to obtain, other \ncommitted sources of non-dilutive funding to replace the CCIA award funds.  And JCF cannot \nreplicate the reputational benefit of being selected for a major federal award after an extensive, \nmerit-based selection process performed by EPA.   \n15.  JCF is also harmed by EPA’s public campaign of misleading claims designed to \ndemonize GGRF Recipients, including JCF. EPA’s public statements suggest that JCF is an \nunqualified, undeserving, or unlawful recipient of these award funds, despite JCF’s success in an \nextensive, EPA-led, merit-based review.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 8 of 133\n16.  JCF is further harmed by EPA’s efforts to “starve” JCF by undermining JCF’s access \nto capital, stymieing its ability to meet its obligations under the Award Agreement, and by the \ndisruption of JCF’s relationships with numerous partners whose cooperation with and confidence \nin JCF are essential to JCF’s achievement of its mission. The small community lenders who would \nbe JCF’s subgrantees have no litigation budgets and cannot bring suit themselves. And all \ninvolved—private capital providers, JCF’s vendors and consultants, and the community lenders \nthemselves—have expressed understandable, rational concerns about losing other clients or being \ndamaged by EPA’s broad-brush targeting of GGRF Recipients, including JCF. JCF is concerned \nthat, unless JCF receives immediate relief, JCF’s ability to perform its crucial work will be \nirretrievably lost.  \n17.  EPA’s and Citibank’s actions have also compromised JCF’s reliability, a crucial \ncomponent of its work as a provider of capital. JCF is the source of capitalization funding and \ntechnical assistance grants for its network of community lenders. As an EPA-selected award \nrecipient, JCF must be able to fulfill all of its funding commitments to these community lenders, \nincluding for the life of the qualified projects that these Community Lenders are advancing. \nCongress and JCF have a shared mission under JCF’s EPA-approved Award Agreement, and JCF’s \nEPA-approved workplan includes a private capital mobilization target of approximately $1.6 \nbillion. Without the stable source of funding that the award represents, JCF’s reputation will be \nirreparably and irreversibly harmed, and JCF will be compromised in its ability to attract the high-\nquality partners and mobilize private capital co-investors that is critical to JCF’s compliance with \nthe Award Agreement. \n18.  JCF’s Award Agreement should progress and JCF’s access to its award funding \nshould be restored. The Court should enjoin EPA’s illegal “Notice of Termination” and enjoin EPA \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 9 of 133\nfrom taking actions premised on that illegal termination. The Court should also enjoin Citibank \nfrom violating the unambiguous terms of the ACA. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on EPA’s violation of \nthe  Administrative  Procedure  Act,  federal  regulations  and  statutes,  and  the  Constitution’s \nAppropriations Clause and Due Process Clause. This action also seeks declaratory and injunctive \nrelief against Citibank based on its breach of contract. \n20.  The Court has jurisdiction over JCF’s claims against EPA Defendants under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n21.  This Court has jurisdiction over JCF’s claims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367, because those claims are so related to JCF’s claims against EPA Defendants that they form \npart of the same case or controversy.2  \n22.  Venue in this District is proper pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because EPA \nDefendants are located in this District and a substantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this District. \n23.  This case presents a live controversy about whether EPA lawfully terminated JCF’s \naward, or instead whether EPA’s termination is unlawful because it is arbitrary and capricious and \nviolates multiple regulations, statutes, and constitutional provisions. This case also presents a live \ncontroversy about whether Citibank breached and is continuing to breach the ACA. \n \n2 Even if EPA were not named as a defendant, the Court would have jurisdiction over JCF’s claims \nagainst Citibank under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the parties are of diverse citizenship and the \namount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 10 of 133\nPARTIES \n24.  JCF, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business in Washington, \nD.C., is a nonprofit organization. JCF’s work aims to mobilize capital and resources to strengthen \nunder-resourced communities, funding projects that provide clean energy, support cleaner air and \nwater, improve public health, and build economic resilience so all people across the nation can \nthrive. In its EPA-approved workplan, JCF estimated that its work would reduce and avoid 5.32 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions, directly and indirectly support 61,700 jobs, and \nmobilize $1.56 billion of private capital. \n25.  Defendant Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) is a national banking association organized \nand existing under the laws of the United States of America, with headquarters in South Dakota. \nCitibank is the wholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc., headquartered in New York. \n26.  Defendant EPA is the agency of the federal government of the United States \nresponsible for administering the GGRF and its constituent NCIF program. EPA is an agency \nwithin the meaning of the APA. \n27.  Defendant Lee Zeldin is the Administrator of EPA and the agency’s highest-ranking \nofficial. JCF sues Mr. Zeldin in his official capacity. \n28.  Defendant William Charles McIntosh is the Acting Deputy Administrator of EPA \nand the agency’s second highest-ranking official. JCF sues Mr. McIntosh in his official capacity. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Congress Establishes the CCIA Program. \n29.  In 2022, Congress passed, and President Biden signed into law, the Inflation \nReduction Act (“IRA”). Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818. Among other components, the IRA \namended the Clean Air Act to authorize EPA to make competitive grants under the Greenhouse \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 11 of 133\nGas Reduction Fund (“GGRF”) to provide financial assistance for “the rapid deployment of low- \nand zero-emission products, technologies, and services.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(1). \n30.  The statute created this new program to leverage public funds with private capital \nand catalyze investment into places and projects that support local economic development, much \nlike other government programs such as Small Business Administration loan guarantees, New \nMarket Tax Credits, and Opportunity Zones. \n31.  Specifically, Section 134(a)(3) of the IRA appropriated to the EPA Administrator \n$8 billion to “make grants, on a competitive basis …, to eligible recipients for the purposes of \nproviding  financial  assistance  and  technical  assistance  in  low-income  and  disadvantaged \ncommunities in accordance with subsection (b).” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(3). \n32.  In turn, subsection (b) provides that an eligible recipient shall use the grant in \naccordance with the following goals: (1) facilitating “financial assistance to qualified projects at \nthe national, regional, State, and local levels”; (2) prioritizing “investment in qualified projects \nthat would otherwise lack access to financing”; (3) “retain[ing], manag[ing], recycl[ing], and \nmonetiz[ing] all repayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid loans, and all \nother types  of  financial  assistance  provided  using  grant  funds  under  this  section  to  ensure \ncontinued operability”; and (4) providing “funding and technical assistance to establish new or \nsupport existing public, quasi-public, not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial \nassistance to qualified projects.” Id. § 7434(b). \n33.  Eligible recipients are defined to include nonprofit organizations that are “designed \nto provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the \nrapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services,” that do not \n“take deposits other than deposits from repayments and other revenue received from financial \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 12 of 133\nassistance provided using grant funds under this section,” that are “funded by public or charitable \ncontributions,” and that “invest[ ] in or finance[ ] projects alone or in conjunction with other \ninvestors.” Id. § 7434(c)(1). \n34.  Qualified projects are defined to include any “project, activity, or technology” that \neither “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership \nwith, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector,” or “assists communities in the efforts \nof those communities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air \npollution.” Id. § 7434(c)(3). \n35.  In  July  2023,  EPA  launched  three  grant  competitions:    The  National  Clean \nInvestment Fund (“NCIF”), the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (“CCIA”), and Solar \nfor All. The Climate United Litigation concerns grants under the NCIF program. That program \nallocated $14 billion directly to national institutions that themselves lend money, with 40% of \ncapital being dedicated to low-income and disadvantaged communities. \n36.  The $6 billion CCIA competition (“CCIA”), by contrast, focused entirely on \n“financ[ing] clean technology deployment in low-income and disadvantaged communities while \nsimultaneously building the capacity of community lenders that serve those communities.” NOFO \nat 3.  \n37.  The purpose of the CCIA competition was to provide grants to 2-7 hub nonprofits \nthat will provide funding and technical assistance to specific industry networks of public, quasi-\npublic, not-for-profit, and nonprofit community lenders, supporting the goal that every community \nin the country have access to the capital needed to deploy clean technology projects in their homes, \nsmall businesses, schools, and community institutions. NOFO at 4. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 13 of 133\n38.  Unlike the NCIF grant recipients, the CCIA recipients are not themselves lenders, \nbut instead are nonprofit organizations that award grants to numerous community lenders across \nthe country that operate in low-income and disadvantaged communities. \n39.  Section 134(a)(3) provided that the EPA Administrator could award grants “on a \ncompetitive basis” until September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(3). \nII.  JCF Is Awarded CCIA Grant Funding. \n40.  JCF  was  formed  in  2023,  after  the  passage  of  the  IRA,  by  a  coalition  of \norganizations with extensive experience advancing community-development finance for unbanked \nAmerican families, businesses, and communities. JCF’s founding organizations sought to utilize \nCCIA funding to fill a critical gap: Many community lenders were underrepresented in climate \nfinance and lacked access to green lending resources. By forming JCF, coalition members aimed \nto centralize support and technical assistance, ensure that resources flow to community lenders not \nserved by other GGRF awardees, and help lenders build capacity through experience with JCF’s \nsmall-scale funding. \n41.  In July 2023, EPA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for the CCIA. The \nNOFO “included a robust set of application requirements and corresponding evaluation criteria \nthat  were  used  to  assess  materials  submitted  to  meet  those  application  requirements.”3 \n“Application requirements covered a diverse set of topics and included not just a detailed project \nnarrative but also a robust set of application attachments,” such as “organizational and governing \ndocuments; resumes  of  board  members  and senior  management;  legal  and  compliance  risk \n \n3 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Review and Selection Process, EPA (last updated Aug. 16, \n2024), https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/review-and-selection-process. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 14 of 133\nmanagement policies and procedures; financial statements; workplans for the first year of program \nimplementations, and budget narratives.”4 \n42.  EPA established a rigorous process to review and select applications. That process \nincluded an evaluation of each program’s plan, budget, organizational capacity, risk management \nprogram, internal controls, financial statements, and previous experience managing third-party \ncapital. The review was conducted by expert panels with broad and deep qualifications who would \nthen present rankings and recommendations to a Selection Official authorized to make the final \nselection for awards. Id. at 55.  \n43.  JCF applied for CCIA funding on October 12, 2023, seeking $4.4 billion. As part \nof the application process, JCF was required to submit a detailed budget to EPA. Additionally, \nprior to receiving the Notice of Award, JCF was required to attach a negotiated, thoroughly \nreviewed, and approved budget to its award agreement. \n44.  Following the agency’s lengthy and rigorous review process, JCF was awarded \n$940 million. The award was publicly announced by the White House in April 2024, in a press \nrelease touting JCF’s credentials and vision.5 \n45.  Consistent with the purpose of the Inflation Reduction Act under which the CCIA \nfunds were appropriated, JCF developed and EPA approved a workplan that was finalized with the \naward and posted publicly for full transparency. As enumerated in the workplan, the JCF coalition \nplans to empower a national network of community lenders—especially those serving low-income \nand disadvantaged communities—to scale up green lending through a structured program of \n \n4 Id. \n5 Biden-Harris Administration Announces $20 Billion in Grants to Mobilize Private Capital and \nDeliver Clean Energy and Climate Solutions to Communities Across America, EPA (last updated \nAug.  16,  2024),  https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-\nbillion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and. \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 15 of 133\nassessment, training, certification, and support. Its goal is to build long-term capacity for financing \nclimate solutions by prioritizing underserved communities and mobilizing private capital for \nprojects that reduce emissions, create jobs, and improve community well-being. To date, the JCF \ncoalition has received and reviewed 94 applications from community lenders and approved 35 of \nthose applications, committing $248.5 in capitalization funding and technical assistance. Without \naccess to its CCIA award funds, JCF cannot honor those commitments and distribute that funding. \nIII.  The Terms and Conditions of the Award, Including Suspending or Terminating the \nAward. \n46.  The award was memorialized in a final award agreement, known as a Notice of \nAward (“NOA”). The original NOA was dated August 8, 2024. The NOA was then updated on \nDecember 20, 2024. That December NOA sets forth the operative Terms and Conditions for JCF’s \naward and is attached hereto as Exhibit A.  \n47.  The Terms and Conditions require JCF to adhere to a rigorous set of reporting \nrequirements. These include requirements to produce semiannual, annual, and final reports to EPA \nwith  “detailed  narratives  describing  program  performance  …  supported  with  qualitative \ndiscussions and quantitative metrics,” Ex. A at 15-16, submit semi-annual transaction-level and \nproject-level data reports, id. at 17, and provide ongoing disclosures to EPA, id. at 17-18. \n48.  The Terms and Conditions provide that JCF “must obtain prior written approval \nfrom the EPA Project Officer (who will in turn notify the EPA Award Official) for any transfers \nthat will not be disbursed for an Allowable Activity within 15 business days.” Id. at 60. \n49.  In  addition,  the Terms  and  Conditions  require  JCF  (as  well  as  other  GGRF \nrecipients) to complete standard EPA grants training within 90 days of receipt of the award, \nincluding the “EPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and Recipients” and “How to \nDevelop a Budget.” Id. at 5. JCF complied with this requirement, even though JCF had already \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 16 of 133\nsubmitted a detailed budget to EPA in connection with the grant competition selection process, \nand had already attached a negotiated, reviewed, and approved budget to its award agreement \nbefore receiving the Notice of Award. \n50.  The Terms and Conditions constrain EPA’s ability to unilaterally suspend the award \nor prevent JCF from accessing the awarded funds. Instead, the Terms and Conditions specify that \nEPA can suspend or terminate JCF’s award in three (and only three) scenarios. Ex. A at 43.  \na.  First,  EPA  may  terminate  the  Agreement  if  JCF  engages  in  “substantial” \nnoncompliance  such  that  “effective  performance”  is  “Materially  Impaired.”  Id. \nEffective  performance  is  “Materially  Impaired”  if  (1)  EPA  issues  a  “written \ndetermination and finding … that the Recipient has failed to achieve sufficient progress \nin accordance with the Sufficient Progress clause” and, (2) if EPA determines in its sole \ndiscretion that a “corrective action plan” would remedy the issue, EPA must issue a \n“separate written determination and finding” that the Recipient “has not materially \naddressed its failure.” Id. at 9-10. \nb.  Second,  EPA  may  terminate  the  Agreement  if  JCF  engages  in  “material \nmisrepresentation of eligibility status.” Id. at 43. \nc.  Third, EPA may terminate the Agreement for “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” id., which is \ndefined  with  reference  to  the  EPA  General Terms  and  Conditions  and  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.113, id. at 14. Those sources require “credible evidence of the commission of a \nviolation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or \ngratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil \nFalse Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).” See EPA, General Terms and Conditions \n(effective  Oct.  1,  2024),  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2024-\n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 17 of 133\n10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024_or_later.\npdf; 2 C.F.R. § 200.113. \n51.  In addition, EPA is obligated by regulation to take certain procedural steps to \nterminate the award agreement. Among other things, EPA must comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, \nwhich requires EPA to provide written notice of termination to the recipient that includes “the \nreasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, \nif applicable.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.341; Ex. A at 43 (incorporating this regulatory requirement into the \nTerms and Conditions). \n52.  The Terms and Conditions may not be unilaterally modified by either party. Rather, \n“[t]he EPA Award Official and Grants Management Officer and the Recipient must agree to any  \nmodifications to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement. Agreed-upon modifications \nmust be in writing. Oral or unilateral modifications shall not be effective or binding.” Ex. A at 54. \nIV.  The Account Control Agreement Between JCF, EPA, and Citibank. \n53.  The award agreement required JCF to enter into an Account Control Agreement. \nJCF entered into the ACA with EPA and Citibank on November 1, 2024. The ACA is attached \nhereto as Exhibit B. \n54.  Under the ACA, Citibank administers the funds provided under the CCIA, in its \nrole  “as  a  financial  agent  of  the  United  States  pursuant  to  the  authority”  of  the Treasury \nDepartment, and EPA serves as the “Secured Party.” Ex. B at 1. \n55.  The ACA specifies that Citibank’s duties with respect to the funding are exclusively \n“administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature).” Ex. B § 6(a). \nThe ACA further specifies that Citibank “shall not be responsible for any of the agreements \nreferred to or described herein (including, without limitation, the Grant Agreement …), or for \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 18 of 133\ndetermining or compelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby.” Id. \nat 3–4. \n56.  Under the ACA, Citibank is required to disburse funds to JCF upon JCF’s request. \nACA § 2 provides that Citibank “shall comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement \norders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the Accounts \nincluding, without limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or redemption \nof interest or dividends on financial assets in the Accounts.” \n57.  The only circumstances contemplated by the ACA under which Citibank could \nrefuse to disburse funds as directed by JCF is if EPA exercises its “right of control” under the ACA. \nEx. B § 2. \n58.  To exercise its right of control, EPA must notify Citibank of its intention to exercise \nexclusive control over the accounts in a form substantially similar to a sample Notice of Exclusive \nControl contained in the ACA. Id.; see also id. at 1 (stating that JCF and EPA “have agreed that \nthe terms and conditions entitled ‘Deposit Account at Financial Agent’ in the Grant Agreement \nindicate the conditions under which the [EPA] may exercise its right of control”). \n59.  The form Notice of Exclusive Control states: “As required by the Grant Agreement, \nthe Secured Party [i.e., EPA] has issued a written determination and finding that Pledgor [i.e., JCF] \nhas  failed  to  comply  with  the  terms  and  conditions  of  the  Grant  Agreement,  and  that \nnoncompliance is substantial such that effective performance of the Grant Agreement is materially \nimpaired or there is adequate evidence of waste, fraud, material misrepresentation of eligibility \nstatus, or abuse, and that the Secured Party has initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or \npartly  suspend  or  terminate  the  Grant Agreement,  as  authorized  in  the  terms  of  the  Grant \nAgreement.” Ex. B at 10. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 19 of 133\n60.  The form NOEC thus incorporates the standard for termination of the award \nspecified under the Terms and Conditions. Compare id., with Ex. A (December NOA) at 43 \n(discussing termination under “programmatic conditions”). \nV.  The Financial Agency Agreement Between Citibank and the Treasury Department. \n61.  The July 2023 NOFO envisioned entering into “financial agent arrangements with \nthe U.S. Department of Treasury” to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” NOFO at 58. JCF \nhad no role in EPA’s decision to include the financial agent concept in the July 2023 NOFO. \n62.  The financial agent concept is an established mechanism for disbursing government \nfunding that was first authorized in the 1860s and has been used for decades.6 \n63.  After a selection process run by the Treasury Department, Citibank was selected as \nthe Financial Agent. Citibank and Treasury entered into the FAA on September 19, 2024. \n64.  JCF is not a party to the FAA. Citibank’s selection as the Financial Agent was \nannounced to JCF on September 26, 2024. JCF had no role in the selection of the financial agent, \nwhich was coordinated by EPA and the Treasury Department as part of a competitive process. \n65.  EPA has traditionally used the Automated Standard Application for Payments \n(“ASAP”)  system  to  disburse  grant  award  funds.  Under  the  ASAP  system,  the  Treasury \nDepartment does not conduct oversight—it simply reports to EPA the amounts which have been \ndrawn by the recipient and what amounts remain.7 Under the FAA between Citibank and Treasury, \nCitibank agreed to assume this ministerial funding responsibility. EPA’s oversight functions remain \n \n6 Revenue Collections and Payments: Treasury Has Used Financial Agents in Evolving Ways but \nCould  Improve  Transparency,  GAO-17-176  (Jan.  2017),  https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-\n176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions of \ndisbursing payments and collecting revenue.”). \n7 JCF made no draws on its Award funds using the ASAP system. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 20 of 133\nidentical under the FAA and under ASAP. This is why the FAA agreement is between Treasury and \nCitibank, not between EPA and Citibank—Citibank is taking over Treasury’s functions, not EPA’s. \n66.  The FAA provides that Citibank will provide “commercial banking and finance \nservices” “related to programs under the Inflation Reduction Act … including … grant programs” \nsuch as the CCIA. The FAA is not specific to JCF’s award and JCF is not mentioned in the FAA. \n67.  The FAA provides that Citibank “acknowledges and agrees that it owes a fiduciary \nduty of loyalty and fair dealing to the United States when acting as a financial agent of the United \nStates.” The FAA further provides that as a financial agent, Citibank will “act at all times in the \nbest interests of the United States when carrying out its responsibilities under this FAA and in all \nmatters connected with this agency relationship.” The FAA further states that Citibank’s fiduciary \nobligations include the duty to “construe the terms of this FAA and any related instructions from \nTreasury in a reasonable manner to serve the purposes and interests of the United States” and “to \nact only within the scope of its actual authority and to comply with all lawful instructions or \ndirections received from Treasury.” \n68.  The FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts, and transfer funds in frozen \naccounts, at the direction of the relevant secured party [i.e., EPA],” but specifies that any such \naction must be “in accordance with the account control agreements.” In other words, nothing in \nthe FAA authorizes Citibank to freeze or transfer JCF’s award money absent a valid “Notice of \nExclusive Control” under the ACA.  \n69.  The FAA provides EPA with “full account visibility.” The FAA thus gives EPA full, \nreal-time view access into all accounts of JCF and its subrecipients, and full transparency into how \naward funds are being disbursed.  \nVI.  JCF Uses Award Funds Provided by Citibank in the Normal Course. \n70.  JCF’s funds were fully obligated by EPA on August 8, 2024.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 21 of 133\n71.  JCF drew money from its Citibank accounts approximately once every two weeks \nto pay operating expenses, as permitted by the governing Terms and Conditions, which requires \nprior approval for drawing of transfers that will not be disbursed in the following fourteen business \ndays. See Ex. A (December NOA) at 60. \n72.  JCF has used award funds for salaries and benefits for the 14 employees on its \npayroll.  \n73.  JCF plans to use award funds to fund green lending projects to benefit under-\nresourced communities. Thus far, JCF has selected 34 community lenders to receive funds. \n74.  Throughout this period, EPA has exercised its oversight and supervisory authority, \nincluding through: receipt of quarterly, semi-annual, and annual reports; holding frequent and \nregular meetings to discuss JCF’s program plans, reporting, oversight, and application of the EPA \nTerms and Conditions; view access to each of JCF’s Citibank accounts, allowing EPA to see funds \nbeing spent and what budget category that spending relates to; the requirement that JCF provide a \ncertification each time it submits a draw request to Citibank for a financial assistance transaction \nestablishing that the draw is necessary to execute against its EPA-approved workplan; JCF’s \nadoption of detailed policies as required by EPA, including investment policies and procedures to \napprove projects, many of which require further reporting from project borrowers; and JCF’s being \nsubject to standard audit requirements by a third-party auditor, including both financial audits and \na Single Audit for federal grant compliance. \nVII.  EPA Takes Actions to Attempt to Suspend or Terminate JCF’s Award, And to Cause \nCitibank to Withhold JCF’s Funds. \n75.  On January 30, 2025, Administrator Zeldin was sworn in as the EPA Administrator. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 22 of 133\n76.  On February 12, 2025, Administrator Zeldin made a public statement announcing \nEPA’s goal of taking possession of grant funds disbursed pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act.8 \nWithout mentioning any specific basis for adverse action under the terms of JCF’s award—or that \nof any other recipient—Administrator Zeldin stated that “the financial agent agreement with the \nBank needs to be instantly terminated,” and stated that “the Bank must immediately return” the \ngrant funds.9 To ensure EPA “reassume[s] responsibility for all of these funds,” Administrator \nZeldin then stated that he would “refer[] this matter to the Inspector General’s Office and …  work \nwith the Justice Department,” and that EPA was “not going to rest” until it had “recover[ed]” the \ngrant funds.10 \n77.  According to public news reporting, EPA thereafter took multiple actions designed \nto suspend or terminate JCF’s award and cause Citibank to withhold award funds from JCF. Those \nactions include, but are not limited to: \na.  On February 17, 2025, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”) at the \nDepartment of Justice communicated with the United States Attorney’s Office in \nWashington, D.C. (“USAO-DC”), seeking to open a grand jury investigation into \nGGRF contracts awarded by EPA, including to JCF.11 Denise Cheung, the Chief of the \n \n8  Lee  Zeldin  (@EPALeeZeldin),  X,  at  1:40  (Feb.  12,  2025,  7:52  PM), \nhttps://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778. \n9 Id. at 2:15. \n10  Rapid  Response  47  (@RapidResponse47),  X  (Feb.  25,  2025,  10:16  AM), \nhttps://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1894406216052289869. \n11 Read the Resignation Letter by Denise Cheung, a Veteran D.C.

On February 17, 2025, FBI “recommended” that Citibank freeze assets in the accounts \nof JCF and every other prime recipient of a GGRF grant.13 FBI did not refer to the FAA \nbetween Citibank and Treasury, or any obligations under the FAA. FBI did not produce \na warrant issued by a judge who found probable cause based on a sworn affidavit. FBI \ndid not articulate exigent circumstances justifying an immediate seizure of JCF’s assets \nwithout notice to JCF. FBI did not identify any substantive factual basis for this \n“recommendation.” FBI took this action even though Ms. Cheung had advised that \nthere was not “sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize \nthe particular accounts identified.”14 \nc.  That same day, the ODAG instructed that a second letter be sent to Citibank directing \nthat Citibank implement an asset freeze and refrain from releasing funds in the accounts \nof 28 other GGRF awardees and subawardees pursuant to a criminal investigation.15 In \nresponse, senior officials at the DC-USAO again asserted there was not sufficient \nevidence to justify issuing that letter.16 Consistent with her oath of office, Ms. Cheung \nrefused to send the letter and was forced to resign on February 18, 2025.17 \n \n12 Resignation Letter, supra note 11 (noting assessment that no “predicate for opening such a grand \njury investigation existed” on the face of the existing documents provided by ODAG). \n13 Exhibit 5 to Citibank’s TRO Opposition, Climate Fund United v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-cv-698-\nTSC (D.D.C.

Apparently without signoff from other prosecutors at the DC-USAO, Interim U.S. \nAttorney Ed Martin submitted a seizure warrant application with a magistrate judge, \nwhich was rejected.18 After that, ODAG reportedly sought a different U.S. attorney’s \noffice to carry out the warrant request in order to launch a grand jury investigation and \nobtain a court-ordered bank freeze, but prosecutors in that office likewise refused to do \nso.19 \ne.  On February 19, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated on X that he had “just read” a “grant \nagreement” related to the GGRF, characterizing it as “wild.”20  \nf.  On February 23, 2025, Administrator Zeldin discussed the GGRF program on national \ntelevision  and  stated,  without  basis,  that  “the  entire  scheme,  in  my  opinion,  is \ncriminal.”21 \ng.  On March 2, 2025, EPA Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh sent a letter to EPA’s \nOffice of the Inspector General asking for an OIG investigation into GGRF funding.22 \nThat  letter,  which  was  public,  stated  that  Citibank  was  withholding  the  funds \n \n18 Spencer Hsu, Maxine Joselow & Nicolas Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe Amid Pushback from \nJudge,  Prosecutors,  Wash.

EPA then sent a copy of that letter to Citibank by email, asserting that the letter \n“highlights several of the egregious instances of misconduct regarding $20 billion \nGGRF  distributions  that  have  been  improperly  funneled  through  your  financial \ninstitution,”  and  stating  that  “EPA  will  continue  our  efforts  to  re-establish \naccountability  and  oversight  over  the  GGRF,  which  is  riddled  with  self-dealing, \nconflicts  of  interest,  extraordinarily  unqualified  recipients,  improperly  reduced \ngovernment oversight, and much more.”23 Beyond these generalized statements, the \ncommunication to Citibank offers no basis for its assertions of “conflicts of interest, \nextraordinarily unqualified recipients,” or “improperly reduced government oversight” \nwith respect to JCF (or any other awardee). \ni.  On March 4, 2025, the Department of Treasury directed Citibank not to disburse funds \nfrom any of the GGRF accounts for a specified period. In an email to Citibank at 10:02 \nPM, Treasury stated that “Treasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity as fiduciary, \nto work directly with the EPA to establish and implement reasonable account controls \nto serve the purposes and interests of the United States, in accordance with Section 5 \nof the FAA. Further, in order to provide the EPA with the necessary time to develop \nreasonable account controls, we are further instructing Citibank not to disburse funds \nfrom any of the GGRF accounts prior to the end of the day Sunday, March 9, 2025.”  \n \n23 Exhibit 6 to Citibank’s TRO Opposition, Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-cv-698-\nTSC (Mar. 12, 2025), ECF No. 14-6. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 26 of 133\nj.  Neither the ACA nor the FAA permits such a direction based on vague and unfounded \nsuspicions. The FAA only permits Citibank to freeze funds “in accordance with the \naccount control agreements,” but the ACA did not permit this freeze. The FAA requires \nCitibank to comply with “all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury,” \nbut the instructions on March 4 and 10 were not lawful. Citibank’s role as a fiduciary \nof the United States does not extend to suborning unlawful conduct by EPA or Treasury. \nk.  On March 8, 2025, EPA sent Citibank a letter regarding GGRF grant recipients. On \ninformation  and  belief,  that  communication  directed  Citibank  to  “not  resume \nprocessing payment instructions for GGRF accounts,” or language to that effect. \nl.  On March 10, 2025, in an email to Citibank with the timestamp of 12:28 AM eastern \ntime, EPA directed Citibank to continue to refrain from processing payments. The \nmessage stated: “In its communication to the Bank this week, the U.S. Department of \nthe Treasury (Treasury) directed the Bank to cooperate with EPA on account controls. \nTo prevent the misuse of funds in the interim, EPA instructs the Bank, pursuant to this \nTreasury directive, the grant agreements, and Section I.B of Exhibit A to the [FAA], to \npause the processing of payment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further \nnotice.”  \nm. This direction was also illegal: Section I.B of Exhibit A to the FAA did not permit \nTreasury to take this step unless the award was lawfully terminated. As of March 10, \nthe award had not been terminated and no termination would have been lawful. \n78.  Presumably due to EPA’s unlawful pressure campaign, Citibank has failed to \ncomply with JCF’s normal-course request for a disbursement, as required by the ACA, and has \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 27 of 133\nfailed to provide JCF with any legal basis for its failure to act other than a vague reference to \nawaiting EPA’s guidance. \na.  On February 25, 2025, JCF placed a request to Citibank to draw funds from JCF’s \naccount. In the normal course, Citibank would have distributed the funds to JCF. But \nJCF’s accounts with Citibank do not reflect that the disbursement occurred, and JCF \ndid not receive any funds from its account. \nb.  On February 26, 2025, at 3:40 pm, JCF submitted an email message to Citibank noting \nthat its funding request remained pending and had not been disbursed. The letter asked \nfor an update on the status of the draw request. \nc.  On February 26, 2025, at 6:41pm, Citibank responded, saying that Citibank “d[id] not \nhave an updated status at this time” and were “continu[ing] to monitor the situation \nwith EPA for status updates.” Citibank stated that it would “advise once we have new \ninformation  to  share  regarding  the  draw  request.”  JCF  received  no  further \ncommunications from Citibank. \nd.  On March 4, 2025, in “a statement emailed to Newsweek…, a spokesperson for \nCitibank said Citi has been working with federal officials to ‘address government \nofficials’ concerns’ regarding the GGRF. ‘Our role as financial agent does not involve \nany discretion over which organizations receive grant funds,’ the bank said in its \nstatement. ‘Citi will of course comply with any binding instructions from the federal \ngovernment.’”24 \n \n24 Jeff Young, Green Group Wants EPA to Explain Why $20 Billion Accounts Are Frozen, \nNewsweek  (Mar.  4,  2025),  https://www.newsweek.com/climate-united-fund-epa-letter-\nfrozenbank-accounts-2039608. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 28 of 133\n79.  EPA has failed to provide JCF with a reasoned explanation for its actions or a \nmeaningful opportunity to object or to be heard. EPA never informed JCF that EPA had been \ntrying to freeze, suspend, or terminate JCF’s award or its access to award funds, or that EPA had \ndirected Citibank to stop disbursing funds to JCF. EPA never provided JCF with a reasoned \nexplanation, or any explanation, for its actions. \nVIII.  EPA Sends a Purported “Notice of Termination” \n80.  On March 11, 2025, EPA sent JCF a “Notice of Termination” (“Notice”). That \nNotice is materially identical to the notices that EPA sent to the three NCIF recipients that are at \nissue in Climate United Litigation and is attached hereto as Exhibit C.  \n81.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under 2 C.F.R. §[ ] 200.339.” Ex. C at 1. 2 C.F.R. § 200.339 applies only when “the \nrecipient … fails to comply with the U.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and \nconditions of the Federal award.” EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any explanation as to how JCF \nviolated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, term, or condition of the grant, let alone \nany evidence that might substantiate such an allegation. \n82.  The “Notice” also states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under … 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340.” Ex. C at 1. 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, which is the only \ntermination authority mentioned in EPA’s General Terms and Conditions for grants, permits \ntermination “[b]y the Federal agency … if the recipient … fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award” or “[b]y the Federal agency … pursuant to the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award ….” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA’s “Notice” does not \noffer any explanation as to how JCF has failed to comply with any Terms and Conditions of its \ngrant, let alone any evidence that might substantiate such an allegation. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 29 of 133\n83.  The “Notice” also states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under … the General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements.” Ex. \nC at 1. EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any explanation as to how JCF has failed to comply with any \nGeneral Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award agreements, let alone any evidence that \nmight substantiate such an allegation. \n84.  The “Notice” also states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under … the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement.” Id. The Grant Agreement \nspecifies that termination may occur only if one of three conditions is met: (1) noncompliance with \nthe grant’s Terms and Conditions; (2) “adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which in \nturn requires “credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving \nfraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code \nor a violation of the civil False Claims Act”; and (3) “material misrepresentation of eligibility \nstatus.” Ex. A at 43. EPA’s “Notice” does not say which of these conditions has been met, provide \nany explanation as to how JCF has violated the terms or conditions of the grant, or offer any \nevidence to substantiate any such allegation.  \n85.  The “Notice” also states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to … the \nAgency’s inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.” Ex. C \nat 1. EPA’s “Notice” does not identify the source of such inherent authority or any new information \nto support reconsidering the prior determination to award the grant to JCF less than one year ago. \n86.  The “Notice” also states that the “termination is based on substantial concerns \nregarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and \nmisalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 30 of 133\nand statutory objectives of the award.” Id. EPA’s “Notice” does not identify any legal or factual \nbasis for terminating the grant on these grounds. \n87.  The “Notice” also states that EPA has identified certain deficiencies, such as “the \nabsence of adequate oversight and account controls,” “allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s \noversight  and  fiscal  responsibilities,”  and  the  “circumvention  and  defeat  of  key  oversight \nmechanisms.” Id. EPA’s “Notice” does not substantiate these concerns or identify any legal or \nfactual basis for terminating the grant on these grounds. \n88.  Finally, the “Notice” asserts that EPA has “determined that its existing process for \nawarding and overseeing execution of the Grant Agreement” may violate the “Appointments \nClause and private nondelegation doctrine.” Id. at 2. EPA’s “Notice” does not explain any legal or \nfactual basis for terminating the grant on these grounds. Indeed, neither the Appointments Clause \nnor the private nondelegation doctrine is implicated by this grant agreement. \n89.  By press release dated March 11, 2025, EPA confirmed that it had “notified \nNational Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the \ntermination of their grant agreements.”25 \nIX.  EPA Modifies Its General Terms and Conditions to Add a New Ground for \nTermination, Then Rescinds Those Changes Days Later. \n90.  On March 25, 2025, EPA updated its general terms and conditions to add “a new \ntermination provision if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.” \n91.  The new termination provision purported to permit termination, with respect to “all \nnew awards and funding amendments (incremental and supplemental) made on or after March 25, \n \n25 See Press Release, EPA, Administrator Zeldin Terminates Biden-Harris $20B ‘Gold Bar’ Grants \n(Mar. 11, 2025), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/administrator-zeldin-terminates-biden-harris-\n20b-gold-bar-grants. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 31 of 133\n2025,” “[b]y the EPA or pass-through entity to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer \neffectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”   \n92.  This new termination provision would not have been effective as against JCF’s \nCCIA award, for at least three reasons: (1) the exclusive grounds for termination are set forth in \nthe Terms and Conditions of the Grant Agreement, Ex. A (December NOA) at 43; (2) EPA may \nnot unilaterally modify the Terms and Conditions of the Grant Agreement, id. at 54; and (3) the \nGrant Terms and Conditions formally incorporate EPA’s General Terms and Conditions as they \nwere on the effective date of the December NOA, which cannot be changed without JCF’s consent, \nsee id. at 54-55 (providing that “the EPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024” \n“are incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement as of the effective date of this amended \nAward Agreement” and are “controlling … in the event [they] are … replaced”); see also id. at 55 \n(“This provision cannot be changed without the consent of the Recipient.”). \n93.  On Friday, March 28, 2025, EPA effectively rescinded its March 25, 2025, changes, \nreplacing the EPA General Terms and Conditions with the version that was effective prior to March \n25, 2025. \nX.  Citibank and EPA’s Actions Have Harmed JCF. \n94.  JCF was created specifically to apply for and distribute money pursuant to the CCIA \ngrant. The CCIA award is currently the basis of funding for all financing projects that JCF is \nplanning to launch and for nearly all of JCF’s operations. Even temporary inability to access its \nfunding immediately threatens JCF’s operations, its ongoing and future projects, and its long-term \nreputation. \n95.  Without access to its award funds, JCF is unable to carry out the mission for which \nit was created and funded—deploying capital to vetted community lenders for use funding green \nprojects that would not otherwise have been financed. \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 32 of 133\n96.  EPA’s and Citibank’s actions harm both JCF’s reputation and the ultimate success \nof JCF’s endeavors. Many community lenders were already hesitant about participating in the \nGGRF  program  for  fear  of  being  labeled  “woke”  or  otherwise  targeted.  Through  careful \nrelationship building and concerted efforts to educate potential partners on the benefits of clean \nlending—including the massive potential for job creation and the benefits to under-resourced \ncommunities—JCF  was  able  to  generate  significant  interest  in  its  mission.  EPA’s  baseless \naccusations of “waste, fraud, or abuse,” and its targeting of JCF, have damaged the relationships \nJCF forged. And Citibank’s refusal to permit JCF to draw its grant funds has prevented JCF from \nmaking good on its commitments to its community lending partners. \n97.  EPA’s and Citibank’s actions place JCF at risk of running afoul of the NOA, which \nwould further hamper its mission. The NOA provides that “[t]he EPA Project Officer may assess \nwhether the Recipient is making sufficient progress in implementing the workplan in effect under \nthis Assistance Agreement within 90 calendar days of June 30, 2025.” Ex. A at 42. “‘Sufficient \nprogress’ shall be assessed based on a comparison of the Recipient’s planned versus actual \nexpenditures as well as planned versus actual outputs/outcomes.” Id. If JCF is found not to have \nachieved “sufficient progress”—because EPA and Citibank have cut off its access to the funds \nessential to its mission—it may be subject to a “corrective action plan” under 2 C.F.R. § 200.208. \nId. at 43. \n98.  2 C.F.R. § 200.208 permits EPA to, among other things, “withhold[] authority to \nproceed to the next phase until receipt of evidence of acceptable performance,” “[r]equir[e] \nadditional project monitoring,” and “establish[] additional prior approvals.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.208(c). \nUnless it is remedied quickly, EPA’s concerted effort to stymie JCF’s work could succeed even if \nits attempt to claw back the grant fails. Absent access to the funds it is charged with deploying, \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 33 of 133\nJCF risks being found not to have made “sufficient progress,” which would enable EPA to impose \nmeasures that would slow JCF’s work to a halt even if it regains access to its grant funds. \nXI.  EPA Agrees Not to Move JCF’s Grant Money out of or Exercise Control over JCF’s \nCitibank Account While the Temporary Restraining Order for the NCIF Plaintiffs is \nIn Effect. \n99.  On March 18, 2025, the court issued a temporary restraining order in the Climate \nUnited Litigation, which (among other things) enjoined EPA Defendants “from giving effect to \nEPA  Defendants’  Termination  Letter,  pending  a  determination  on  the  merits”  and  “from \ntransmitting or taking action to implement the termination of Plaintiffs’ grants, including taking \naction that results in the transfer, re-obligation, or re-allocation of the grant funds in Plaintiffs’ \nCitibank accounts, or issuing a Notice of Exclusive Control under its agreements[.]” Climate \nUnited Fund v. Citibank, N.A., -- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 842360, at *12 (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025). \n100.  On March 28, 2025, as conveyed in an email to JCF’s counsel—attached hereto as \nExhibit D—“EPA … agreed not to take any steps to move the money out of or exercise control \nover JCF’s Citi account while the TRO for the NICF [sic] plaintiffs is in effect.” Ex. D at 1. \n101.  In reliance on these representations, JCF does not intend at present to seek a \ntemporary restraining order to enjoin the EPA Defendants from taking steps to move money out of \nor exercise control over JCF’s Citibank account. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—\nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS (CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION)  \n(EPA Defendants) \n102.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n103.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary” or “capricious.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 34 of 133\n104.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate JCF’s grant by delivering a “Notice \nof Termination.”  \n105.  EPA’s purported termination of JCF’s grant constitutes final agency action under \nthe APA.  \n106.  EPA’s purported termination of JCF’s grant is arbitrary and capricious because EPA \nhad no legal or factual basis for the termination and EPA did not provide an adequate or reasoned \nbasis for the termination.  \na.  The “Notice” states that EPA is terminating JCF’s grant “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] authority \nunder 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40, the General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance \naward agreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and the Agency's \ninherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.” Ex. \nC at 1. But EPA’s “Notice” does not offer any evidence or explanation to support \ntermination on those grounds. Indeed, there is no legal or factual basis for termination \non any of those grounds. JCF has not violated any constitutional provision, statute, or \nregulation; has not failed to comply with any Terms or Conditions of its grant; has not \nfailed to comply with any General Terms and Conditions of EPA assistance award \nagreements; has not engaged in “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which is defined as “the \ncommission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, \nbribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation \nof the civil False Claims Act”; and has not triggered any of the grounds for termination \nunder the Terms and Conditions of its grant.  \nb.  EPA’s “Notice” does not identify the source of any inherent authority to terminate the \ngrant;  does  not  identify  any  new  information  to  support  reconsidering  the  prior \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 35 of 133\ndetermination to award the grant to JCF less than one year ago; does not identify any \nbasis to terminate the grant based on concerns about program integrity, the award \nprocess,  programmatic  fraud,  waste,  and  abuse,  misalignment  with  the Agency’s \npriorities, or sufficiency of oversight mechanisms or account controls; and does not \nexplain any legal or factual basis for terminating the grant based on the Appointments \nClause or the private nondelegation doctrine.  \nc.  EPA’s termination reflects an arbitrary and capricious change in position. EPA has \nprovided no reasoned explanation for its decision to terminate JCF’s grant on March \n11, 2025, when the grant was awarded in April 2024, following months of rigorous \nreview as part of a competitive application process.  \nd.  EPA’s “Notice” provides no explanation for its abrupt change of position that accounts \nfor upsetting the reliance interests of JCF and its community lenders.  \n107.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n108.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s termination \nof the grant is arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA.  \nCOUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT - NOT IN \nACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS (CHALLENGE TO \nTERMINATION)  \n(EPA Defendants) \n109.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n110.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n111.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate JCF’s grant by delivering a “Notice \nof Termination.”  \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 36 of 133\n112.  EPA’s termination of JCF’s award constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n113.  EPA’s termination of JCF’s award is not in accordance with law because it violates \nmultiple federal regulations. For example:  \na.  EPA’s termination of the award violates EPA regulations and Uniform Grant Guidance \nregulations codified at 2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq., which do not allow EPA to terminate \nJCF’s grant under these circumstances.  \nb.  EPA’s termination of the award has not complied with EPA’s regulatory obligation to \ntake certain procedural steps to terminate the award agreement, such as providing \nwritten notice of termination that includes “the reasons for termination, the effective \ndate, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.” 2 C.F.R. § \n200.341(a).  The  Notice  only  provides  vague  references  to  “waste”  and \n“accountability,” among other things, with no supporting evidence or facts as to what \nJCF is alleged to have done wrong. See generally Ex. C. \nc.  EPA’s termination of the award has resulted in improperly withholding payment for \nallowable costs without establishing that JCF has either “failed to comply with the \nterms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United \nStates.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  \nd.  EPA’s  termination  of  the  award  has  resulted in  improperly  withholding  payment \nwithout first making a “determin[ation] that noncompliance cannot be remedied by \nimposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.339. Although the Notice includes a \nvague reference to “material deficiencies” and asserts that “these deficiencies … cannot \nbe remedied by imposing specific conditions,” Ex. C at 1, EPA does not explain these \nstatements or offer facts to support them.  \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 37 of 133\ne.  EPA’s termination of the grant does not comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b), which \nstates: “The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously \nspecify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.” \nEPA’s termination decision is not grounded in the “terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.” Instead, the termination is based on EPA’s disagreement with the GGRF \nprogram.  \n114.  Although EPA’s “Notice” states that EPA is terminating JCF’s award “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s] authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40,” Ex. C at 1, those regulations do not provide EPA \nwith grounds to terminate the award.  \na.  2 C.F.R. § 200.339 applies only when “the recipient … fails to comply with the U.S. \nConstitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.” EPA has not provided any reasoned legal or factual basis to conclude that JCF \nhas violated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or term or condition of the \ngrant. Indeed, JCF has not violated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or \nterm or condition of the award.  \nb.  2 C.F.R. § 200.340 permits termination “[b]y the Federal agency … if the recipient … \nfails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or “[b]y the Federal \nagency … pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award ….” 2 C.F.R. § \n200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA has not provided any reasoned legal or factual basis to \nconclude that JCF has failed to comply with any Terms and Conditions of its award.  \n115.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action.  \n116.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s termination \nof the award is not in accordance with federal regulations, in violation of the APA.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 38 of 133\nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT—NOT \nIN ACCORDANCE WITH INFLATION REDUCTION ACT (CHALLENGE TO \nTERMINATION)  \n(EPA Defendants) \n117.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n118.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n119.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate JCF’s award by delivering a \n“Notice of Termination.”  \n120.  EPA’s termination of JCF’s award constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n121.  EPA’s termination of the award violates the Inflation Reduction Act. The Act \nrequires EPA to spend the funds appropriated for grants to be awarded under the Greenhouse Gas \nReduction Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434. EPA violated the Act because it has not satisfied the stringent \nrequirements for rescinding an appropriation under 2 U.S.C. § 683.  \n122.  Even  if  EPA  “re-obligate[s]  lawfully  appropriated  funds  within  the  GGRF \nprogram,” as EPA claimed in its Notice of Grant Termination that it will do, Ex. C at 2, EPA’s \naction would still be illegal. The Inflation Reduction Act sets a September 30, 2024, deadline for \nall grants to be awarded. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)–(3). Illegally terminating the entire program, and \nthen re-awarding grants to unspecified new recipients, is inconsistent with that September 30, 2024 \ndeadline.  \n123.  As  a  result  of  EPA’s  conduct,  JCF  has  suffered  and  will  continue  to  suffer \nirreparable injury.  \n124.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 39 of 133\n125.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s termination \nof the award is not in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, in violation of the APA.  \nCOUNT FOUR: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \n(CHALLENGE TO SUSPENSION)  \n(EPA Defendants) \n126.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n127.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, … or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n128.  Prior to March 11, 2025, EPA effectuated a suspension of JCF’s award by causing \nCitibank to withhold JCF’s grant funds.  \n129.  EPA’s suspension of JCF’s award constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n130.  EPA’s suspension of JCF’s award is not in accordance with federal regulations, as \ndescribed above. For example, EPA’s actions resulted in improperly withholding payment for \nallowable costs without establishing that JCF has either “failed to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United States.” 2 C.F.R. § \n200.305(b)(6).  \n131.  EPA’s suspension of JCF’s award is arbitrary and capricious.  \na.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to open a grand jury investigation into JCF’s award. \nIndeed, EPA’s efforts to do so caused the Chief of the Criminal Division of the United \nStates Attorneys’ Office in Washington, D.C. to resign from that office after 24 years \nof service.  \nb.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to cause a Freeze Letter to be issued to Citibank, or \nto cause Citibank or Treasury to freeze JCF’s award funds, particularly when the freeze \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 40 of 133\n“recommendation” was not supported by an order issued by a judge based on probable \ncause and cited no evidence in support of freezing JCF’s grant funds.  \nc.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to direct Treasury to demand that Citibank stop \ndisbursing funds. Further, Treasury’s action did not comply with the FAA, which states \nthat any freeze of JCF’s accounts must occur in accordance with the ACA and must be \nlawful.  \n132.  JCF continues to experience ongoing injury from the suspension because during the \nsuspension period it has not received funds to which it is lawfully entitled. Further, even if the \ntermination is enjoined, any suspension that remains in effect would cause harm to JCF.  \n133.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action.  \n134.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s suspension \nof the award is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in violation of the APA.  \nCOUNT FIVE: VIOLATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE  \n(EPA Defendants) \n135.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n136.  The Appropriations Clause provides: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, \nbut in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I,§ 9, cl. 7.  \n137.  The  provision  of  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  authorizing  the  GGRF  is  an \n“appropriation” because it authorizes EPA to expend $27 billion for purposes of carrying out the \nGGRF program.  \n138.  In the Inflation Reduction Act, Congress “appropriated to the [EPA] Administrator \n… $8,000,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2024, to make grants, on a competitive \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 41 of 133\nbasis.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(3). The Appropriations Clause therefore forbids EPA from using \nappropriated funds to award grants after the statutory deadline.  \n139.  In the “Notice of Termination,” EPA states: “EPA will work to re-obligate lawfully \nappropriated funds within the GGRF program …” Ex. C at 2. In doing so, EPA seeks to spend \nmoney in a manner Congress has not permitted, in violation of the Appropriations Clause.  \n140.  If EPA re-obligates GGRF’s award funds to its preferred recipients, EPA would be \nviolating Congress’s intention for the funds to be obligated to clean-energy grants that were \ncompleted prior to September 30, 2024.  \n141.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc., 575 U.S. \n320, 327 (2015).26 \n142.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action.  \n143.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s suspension \nand termination of the grant violates the Appropriations Clause.  \nCOUNT SIX: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(EPA Defendants) \n144.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n145.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government may \nnot deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest without due process of law.  \n146.  JCF has a protected property interest in its award funds under the CCIA and in the \naccounts at Citibank to which those funds were disbursed.  \n \n26 The APA independently authorizes JCF to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 42 of 133\n147.  The government’s actions preceding the termination, up to and including the \ntermination, violated the Due Process Clause. For example:  \na.  EPA caused Citibank to freeze JCF’s assets without first obtaining a court order based \non probable cause and supported by a sworn affidavit. Indeed, EPA initiated the freeze \ndespite a judge having expressly rejected an application for a seizure warrant on the \nbasis that no probable cause existed.  \nb.  EPA never informed JCF that EPA was trying to freeze, suspend, or terminate JCF’s \naward or its access to award funds, or that EPA was coordinating in secret with Treasury \nand FBI to direct Citibank to stop disbursing funds to JCF. EPA thus deprived JCF of \nits property in the award funds without providing JCF notice or an opportunity to be \nheard prior to the initiation of the freeze.  \nc.  EPA also failed to provide JCF notice or an opportunity to challenge the freeze once it \nhad been implemented. After JCF deduced that its funds had been frozen, EPA refused \nto respond to JCF’s requests to provide an explanation as to why its funding had been \nfrozen and never notified JCF that its funds had been frozen at the EPA’s discretion. At \nthe same time—and again without providing JCF notice of its actions—EPA was \ncontinuing to pressure Citibank to keep JCF from accessing funds in its accounts and \nultimately directed Treasury to order Citibank to withhold JCF’s funds.  \nd.  In an attempt to extend the unlawful freeze of JCF’s assets, EPA issued the “Notice of \nTermination” without any legal or factual basis. It offered no notice or process to JCF \nbefore doing so; and the “Notice” provides no opportunity for JCF to challenge the \npurported “termination” of its award funds after the fact.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 43 of 133\n148.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, lnc., 575 U.S. \n320, 327 (2015).27 \n149.  EPA’s weekslong effort to deprive JCF of its property in the award funds violates \nthe Due Process Clause. JCF is entitled to an injunction preventing EPA from continuing to deprive \nJCF of access to the funds in its accounts without due process.  \nCOUNT SEVEN: BREACH OF CONTRACT  \n(Defendant Citibank) \n150.  JCF  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n151.  Citibank has a duty under the ACA to disburse JCF’s award funds to JCF, as JCF \nrequests.  Under  the ACA,  Citibank  “shall  comply  with  all  instructions,  notifications,  and \nentitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts,” including instructions from “the Pledgor”—i.e., JCF. Ex. B § 2.  \n152.  When JCF requested that Citibank disburse award funds held in JCF’s accounts in \naccordance with the ACA, Citibank failed to disburse such funds.  \n153.  Citibank has no legal or factual basis for failing to disburse award funds from JCF’s \naccounts, as required by the ACA.  \n154.  Under  the ACA,  Citibank’s  duties  with  respect  to  JCF’s  award  funding  are \nexclusively “administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature),” and \nCitibank “shall not be responsible” for determining whether JCF’s requests for the disbursement \nof award funds comply with any applicable contracts or laws. Ex. B at 3.  \n \n27 The APA independently authorizes JCF to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 44 of 133\n155.  The only condition under which Citibank is allowed to refuse JCF’s request to \ndisperse funds is if EPA has delivered a “Notice of Exclusive Control.” EPA has not delivered such \na Notice of Exclusive Control to Citibank.  \n156.  The FAA between Citibank and Treasury, to which JCF is not a party, does not \nprovide Citibank with a legal basis to fail to disburse JCF’s award funds as required by the ACA. \nThe FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts” only “in accordance with” the ACA and in \ncompliance with “lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.” But Citibank froze \nJCF’s funds without following the ACA’s termination provisions and based on instructions that \nwere not lawful.  \n157.  By failing to disburse award funds held in JCF’s accounts, Citibank has breached \nthe ACA.  \n158.  Citibank’s failure to disburse funds, as required under the ACA, has caused damage \nto JCF.  \n159.  JCF  understands  the  predicament  that  EPA  placed  Citibank  in  by  instructing \nCitibank not to disperse funds to which JCF was lawfully entitled under the ACA’s plain terms. \nBut allowing the U.S. government to unlawfully freeze bank customers’ assets risks destabilizing \nthe entire banking system. Even if its breach was understandable, Citibank plainly violated the \nclear terms of the ACA by refusing to honor JCF’s request to disperse award funds to which it was \nlawfully entitled. \n160.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, JCF is entitled to a declaration that Citibank’s failure \nto disburse funds from JCF’s accounts is a breach of the ACA.  \n161.  JCF is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful refusal to honor JCF’s \ndisbursement requests.  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 45 of 133\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, JCF respectfully asks this Court to: \n1.  Declare that EPA’s purported “Notice of Termination” is null, void, and of no legal \neffect;  \n2.  Declare that EPA Defendants’ actions violate the Administrative Procedure Act because \nthey are arbitrary and capricious, not in accordance with federal regulations, and not in \naccordance with federal statutes;  \n3.  Declare that EPA Defendants’ actions violate the Appropriations Clause;  \n4.  Declare that EPA Defendants’ actions violate the Due Process Clause;  \n5.  Enjoin EPA Defendants and others in active concert or participation therewith, including \nofficials at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, from impeding Citibank or from causing \nCitibank to deny, obstruct, delay, or otherwise prevent JCF from accessing its funds as \npermitted under the terms of the ACA and the grant award;  \n6.  Enjoin EPA Defendants from unlawfully suspending or terminating JCF’s award, \nincluding by effectuating the Notice of Termination or sending a Notice of Exclusive \nControl under the ACA, except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant \naward, and applicable law;  \n7.  Declare that Citibank’s failure to disburse award funds from JCF’s accounts is a breach \nof the ACA;  \n8.  Order Citibank to process, disburse, and release all funds in accounts established in \nconnection with JCF’s award, at JCF’s request, in accordance with the ACA, both with \nrespect to requests JCF has already submitted and with respect to future requests;  \n9.  Order that Citibank may not transfer or otherwise move funds out of accounts established \nin connection with JCF’s award, except at JCF’s direction as permitted under the ACA;  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 46 of 133\n10. Appoint a monitor to ensure that EPA and Citibank do not interfere with JCF’s lawful \nattempts to access its award funds; and \n11. Grant such other and further relief as may be just and proper.  \nDated: March 31, 2025      Respectfully submitted \n            /s/ Eric F. Citron \nEric F. Citron (D.D.C.

General Terms and Conditions\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the current EPA general terms and conditions available at: https:\n//www.epa.gov/grants/epa-general-terms-and-conditions-effective-october-1-2024-or-later. These terms\nand conditions are in addition to the assurances and certifications made as a part of the award and the\nterms, conditions, or restrictions cited throughout the award.

Correspondence Condition\nThe terms and conditions of this agreement require the submittal of reports, specific requests for\napproval, or notifications to EPA. Unless otherwise noted, all such correspondence should be sent to the\nfollowing email addresses:\nFederal Financial Reports (SF-425):   and EPA Grants Specialist listed on\nthe award  \nMBE/WBE reports (EPA Form 5700-52A):  Debora Bradford  , \n, and the EPA Grants Specialist listed on the award\nAll other forms/certifications/assurances, Indirect Cost Rate Agreements, Requests for\nExtensions of the Budget and Project Period, Amendment Requests, Requests for other Prior\nApprovals, updates to Recipient information (including email addresses, changes in contact\ninformation or changes in authorized representatives) and other notifications: EPA Grants\nSpecialist listed on the award and EPA Project Officer listed on the award\nQuality Assurance documents, workplan revisions, equipment lists, programmatic reports and\ndeliverables: EPA Project Officer listed on the award\nC. Intergovernmental Review Period\nIn accordance with 40 CFR Part 29, EPA must allow for an intergovernmental review comment period\nwhen a Recipient intends to provide Capitalization Funding to a Community Lender to support CCIA-\nEligible Project(s) that involves construction or land use planning. With the exception of CCIA-Eligible\nProjects that will be carried out in the State of California, the Recipient must ensure that directly affected\nState, areawide, regional, and local government entities have 60 calendar days to review the description\nof the CCIA-Eligible Project(s) contained in the application for funding for the project and provide\ncomments to the EPA Project Officer. CCIA-Eligible Project(s) that will be carried out in the State of\nCalifornia must be submitted to the California Single Point of Contact at https://cfda.opr.ca.gov for review\nas provided in California law.\nEPA has allowed for an intergovernmental review comment period on behalf of the Recipient. This\ncomment period closed on Tuesday October 22, 2024. The Recipient need not take any additional action\nwith respect to intergovernmental review.\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the provisions of 40 CFR Part 29, implementing the Demonstration\nCities, Metropolitan Development Act, the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act, and Executive Order\n12372 as amended in 1983, to ensure that projects funded under federal programs are consistent with\nlocal planning requirements.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 52 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 5\nD. Pre-Award Costs\nAs provided in 2 CFR 200.458, Recipients are authorized to incur pre-award costs, which are costs that\nwould have been allowable if incurred after the date of the Federal award. For competitive grants, EPA\ninterprets the requirement in the regulation that pre-award costs be incurred “directly pursuant to the\nnegotiation and in anticipation of the Federal award” to limit allowable pre-award costs to those a\nRecipient incurs after EPA has notified the Recipient that its application has been selected for award\nconsideration. The pre-award costs must be included in the workplan and budget to be eligible. As\nprovided in 2 CFR 1500.9, Recipients incur pre-award cost at their own risk. Please refer to Section I.C:\nPre-Award Costs of the Interim General Budget Development Guidance for Applicants and Recipients of\nEPA Financial Assistance for additional information.\nE. Pre-Award Administrative Capability \nEPA's policy for awarding Financial Assistance in excess of $200,000 to non-profit organizations requires\nan Administrative Capability Assessment review of the Recipient's administrative and financial\nmanagement systems to be completed prior to the Recipient drawing down any EPA funds per EPA\nOrder 5700.8. The Recipient is precluded from drawing down funds under this Assistance Agreement\nuntil EPA provides written confirmation of the completion of the assessment with satisfactory results.\nPlease note, any costs incurred prior to EPA approval are the Recipient's own risk. If the Recipient fails\nto respond or is unable to satisfactorily address all identified deficiencies within 90 calendar days of the\naward date of this Assistance Agreement or within any extension of time granted by EPA, the agreement\nmay be terminated. Noncompliance with this term and condition may result in adverse action by EPA per\n2 CFR 200.339.\nF. New Recipient Training Requirement\nThe Recipient agrees to complete the EPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and\nRecipients and the How to Develop a Budget training within 90 calendar days of the date of award of this\nagreement. The Recipient must notify the Grant Specialist via email when the required training is\ncomplete. For additional information on this training requirement, the Recipient should refer to RAIN-\n2024-G01.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 5\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 53 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 6\nProgrammatic Conditions\nClean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) Terms and Conditions (December 12, 2024)\nI.

In this program, Participant Support Costs may\ninclude expenditures by the Recipient as Technical Assistance Services and/or Program Administration\nActivities and Community Lenders as Capitalization Funding and/or Technical Assistance Subawards\n(which may include subsidies, rebates, and other payments).  \nPeriod of Closeout: Period of Closeout means the time interval between the beginning of the closeout\nperiod (the date that the award has been closed out, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.344) to the end of\nthe closeout period (the date that the Closeout Agreement has been terminated). The Period of Closeout\nmay also be referred to as the Closeout Period.\nPeriod of Performance: 2 CFR 200.1 defines Period of Performance as “the total estimated time interval\nbetween the start of an initial Federal award and the planned end date, which may include one or more\nfunded portions, or budget periods.” For the purposes of this Award Agreement, Period of Performance\nmeans the time interval between the start of the Federal award (either the first date that the Recipient\nhas incurred allowable pre-award costs or the date on the Notice of Award, whichever is earlier) and the\nend of the Federal award (the date that the award has been closed out, in accordance with 2 CFR\n200.344). The Period of Performance may also be referred to as the Performance Period.\nPost-Closeout Program Income: Post-Closeout Program Income means Program Income retained at the\nend of the Period of Performance, which is subject to the terms and conditions of the Closeout\nAgreement, as well as Program Income earned by the Recipient during the Period of Closeout that is\ndirectly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award, which is also\nsubject to the terms and conditions of the Closeout Agreement. Under the Closeout Agreement, the\nRecipient is authorized to deduct the cost of generating Post-Closeout Program Income under 2 CFR\n200.307(d) and 2 CFR 1500.8(b), provided the costs are reasonable and necessary for performance\nunder the federal award and the costs are not charged to the EPA award. Costs incidental to the\ngeneration of Post-Closeout Program Income include origination, servicing, and management costs that\nare not charged as direct costs to the Federal award or to Post Closeout Program Income. Costs of\ngenerating Post-Closeout Program Income can be incurred in advance of receiving the gross income,\nwith the Recipient incurring the costs and later using gross income to reimburse itself for no more than\nComplaint Exhibit A at 10\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 58 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 11\nthe actual costs incurred to generate the Post-Closeout Program Income, provided the Recipient can\naccount for the actual costs incurred.\nPriority Project Categories: Priority Project Categories means Distributed Energy Generation and\nStorage, Net-Zero Emissions Buildings, and Zero-Emissions Transportation, as defined below.\nDistributed Energy Generation and Storage: Projects, activities, and technologies that deploy\nsmall-scale power generation and/or storage technologies (typically from 1 kW to 10,000 kW),\nplus enabling infrastructure necessary for deployment of such generation and/or storage\ntechnologies. Projects, activities, and technologies within this category must support carbon\npollution-free electricity, which is electrical energy produced from resources that generate no\ncarbon emissions, consistent with the definition specified in Executive Order 14057 (Catalyzing\nClean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability).\nNet-Zero Emissions Buildings: Projects, activities, and technologies that either (1) retrofit an\nexisting building, making a substantial contribution to that building being a net-zero emissions\nbuilding and as part of a plan for that building achieving net-zero emissions over time, or (2)\nconstruct a new net-zero emissions building in a Low-Income and Disadvantaged Community. A\nnet-zero emissions building is a building that meets the requirements of Version 1 of the National\nDefinition for a Zero Emissions Building (June 2024).\nZero-Emissions Transportation: Projects, activities, and technologies that deploy zero-emissions\ntransportation modes, plus enabling infrastructure necessary for zero-emissions transportation\nmodes—especially in communities that are overburdened by existing diesel pollution, particulate\nmatter concentration, and degraded air quality. Projects, activities, and technologies within this\ncategory must be consistent with the zero-emissions transportation decarbonization strategies in\nThe U.S. National Blueprint for Transportation Decarbonization.\nProgram Administration Activities: Program Administration Activities means activities that support\nadministration of the grant program, to the extent such activities meet the requirements for allowability\nunder 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E as well as applicable provisions of 2 CFR Part 1500.

Expenditures to Program Beneficiaries are in the form of\nParticipant Support Costs, as defined in 2 CFR 1500.1. A Program Beneficiary is distinct from a\nSubrecipient, as defined in 2 CFR 200.1.\nProgram Income: 2 CFR 200.1 defines Program Income as “gross income earned by the recipient or\nsubrecipient that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award\nduring the period of performance except as provided in § 200.307(c)”. 2 CFR 200.1 notes that Program\nIncome “includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or\npersonal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a\nFederal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans\nmade with Federal award funds.” For this program, Program Income also includes but is not limited to\nincome from origination fees, servicing fees, and asset management fees; dividends from equity\nComplaint Exhibit A at 11\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 59 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 12\ninvestments; revenue from asset sales; release of grant funds previously used as Financial Assistance\n(such as through loan guarantees, loan loss reserves, or similar transactions); interest and other\nearnings on disbursements of grant funds that have not been transferred to third parties; and funds\nraised with costs charged against the grant award (such as private debt, philanthropic contributions, and\nother funds raised). Program Income must be treated in accordance with the Program Income\nProgrammatic Term and Condition. EPA-specific rules on Program Income are provided at 2 CFR\n1500.8, and rules on allowable fund raising costs are provided under 2 CFR 200.442 (with additional\ndetails in Item 4 of the EPA Guidance on Selected Items of Cost for Recipients). Under this award\nagreement, the Recipient is authorized to deduct the cost of generating program income under 2 CFR\n200.307(d) and 2 CFR 1500.8(b), provided the costs are reasonable and necessary for performance\nunder the federal award and the costs are not charged to the EPA award. Costs incidental to the\ngeneration of program income include origination, servicing, and management costs that are not charged\nas direct costs to the Federal award or to Program Income. Costs of generating program income can be\nincurred in advance of receiving the gross income, with the Recipient incurring the costs and later using\ngross income to reimburse itself for no more than the actual costs incurred to generate the program\nincome, provided the Recipient can account for the actual costs incurred. Program Income requirements\nflow down to Subrecipients but not to Contractors or Program Beneficiaries.\nQualified Project: Section 134(c)(3) of the Clean Air Act provides that a Qualified Project is any project,\nactivity, or technology that (A) reduces or avoids Greenhouse Gas emissions and other forms of air\npollution in partnership with, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector; or (B) assists\ncommunities in the efforts of those communities to reduce or avoid Greenhouse Gas emissions and\nother forms of air pollution. For this Assistance Agreement, Qualified Project means any project, activity\nor technology meeting all six requirements listed below at the time that Financial Assistance is provided\nto the project, activity, or technology:\nThe project, activity, or technology would reduce or avoid Greenhouse Gas Emissions, consistent\nwith the climate goals of the United States to reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions 50-52 percent\nbelow 2005 levels in 2030, reach 50 percent zero-emission vehicles share of all new passenger\ncars and light trucks sold in 2030, achieve a carbon pollution-free electricity sector by 2035, and\nachieve net-zero emissions by no later than 2050. The project, activity, or technology may reduce\nor avoid such emissions through its own performance or through assisting communities in their\nefforts to deploy projects, activities, or technologies that reduce or avoid such emissions.\nThe project, activity, or technology would reduce or avoid emissions of other Air Pollutants. The\nproject, activity, or technology may reduce or avoid such emissions through its own performance\nor through assisting communities in their efforts to deploy projects, activities, or technologies that\nreduce or avoid such emissions.\nThe project, activity, or technology would deliver additional benefits (i.e., in addition to primarily\nreducing or avoiding emissions of Greenhouse Gases and other Air Pollutants) to communities\nwithin one or more of the following seven categories: climate change; clean energy and energy\nefficiency; clean transportation; affordable and sustainable housing; training and workforce\ndevelopment; remediation and reduction of legacy pollution; and development of critical clean\nwater infrastructure.\nThe project, activity, or technology may not have otherwise been financed.\nThe project, activity, or technology would mobilize private capital.\nThe project, activity, or technology would support only commercial technologies, defined as\ntechnologies that have been deployed for commercial purposes at least three times for a period\nof at least five years each in the United States for the same general purpose as the project,\nComplaint Exhibit A at 12\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 60 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 13\nactivity, or technology.\nSenior Management: Senior Management means the chief executive officer, chief risk officer, general\ncounsel, chief compliance officer, chief investment officer, chief reporting officer, and chief financial\nofficer (or equivalent positions).\nSubaward: 2 CFR 200.1 defines a Subaward as “an award provided by a pass-through entity to a\nsubrecipient for the subrecipient to contribute to the goals and objectives of the project by carrying out\npart of a Federal award received by the pass-through entity. It does not include payments to a contractor,\nbeneficiary, or participant”. A Subgrant refers to a Subaward in the form of a grant.\nSubrecipient: Consistent with 2 CFR 200.1, Subrecipient means an entity that receives a Subaward from\na pass-through entity to carry out part of a Federal award but does not include an entity that is a Program\nBeneficiary of such an award. A Subrecipient is distinct from a Program Beneficiary, which is referenced\nin 2 CFR 1500.1. In this program, there are four main types of Subrecipients: (1) a Subrecipient that\nreceives a Subgrant that will be used, either in whole or in part, to provide Capitalization Funding and\nTechnical Assistance Subawards to Community Lenders, or a “Pass-Through Subrecipient;” (2) a\nSubrecipient that receives a Subgrant that will be used exclusively to provide Technical Assistance\nServices and/or Program Administration Activities, or a “Technical Assistance Subrecipient”; (3) a\nSubrecipient that receives a Subgrant in the form of Capitalization Funding and/or Technical Assistance\nSubawards, or a “Community Lender Subrecipient;” and (4) a Subrecipient that receives Financial\nAssistance from a Community Lender in the form of a Subaward, with the Subrecipient then using the\nSubaward to provide Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects, or a “Financial Intermediary\nSubrecipient.” Note that a financial transaction is a Subaward to a Financial Intermediary Subrecipient if\nthe following two characteristics are true: (i) the financial transaction provides an award by a pass-\nthrough entity to a Subrecipient through a form of Federal financial assistance, other than a grant, and (ii)\nthe proceeds of the award are used directly as Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects, carrying\nout part of a Federal award received by the pass-through entity. The EPA Subaward Policy applies to\nSubgrants made to Pass-Through Subrecipients, Technical Assistance Subrecipients, and Community\nLender Subrecipients but not to Subawards made to Financial Intermediary Subrecipients.\nTechnical Assistance Services: Consistent with Section 134(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act, the Recipient will\nprovide Technical Assistance Services to establish new and build the capacity of existing Community\nLenders so that they can provide Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects. Technical Assistance\nServices include targeted support activities for individual Community Lenders, such as providing training,\nmarket analysis, technical support, and structuring expertise as well as financial market-building activities\nfor multiple Community Lenders, such as developing standardized project performance criteria,\nunderwriting guidance, documentation, and product features. A Community Lender does not need to\nhave been selected for Capitalization Funding under this program to be eligible for Technical Assistance\nServices.\nTechnical Assistance Subawards: Consistent with Section 134(b)(2) of the Clean Air Act, the Recipient\nwill provide Technical Assistance Subawards to build the capacity of Community Lenders so that they\ncan provide Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects. The Recipient will provide these Subawards\nin the form of Subgrants, which are subject to the EPA Subaward Policy. Community Lenders will use\nTechnical Assistance Subawards for activities including (but not limited to) procuring training, market\nanalysis, and technical support; hiring staff; developing new financial products; supporting\npredevelopment activities, such as site and building assessments (e.g., energy audits), financial and\ntechnological feasibility studies (e.g., solar resource studies), design and engineering support, and\nComplaint Exhibit A at 13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 61 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 14\npermitting support; and other activities. Community Lenders may use Technical Assistance Subawards\nto make additional Subawards to other organizations, consistent with the EPA Subaward Policy. A\nCommunity Lender may only receive a Technical Assistance Subaward if it has already been selected for\nCapitalization Funding under this program.\nIn general, a Community Lender may receive a maximum of $1,000,000 in total Technical Assistance\nSubawards from all Recipients and Subrecipients under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator;\nhowever, under limited exceptions, a Community Lender may receive total Technical Assistance\nSubawards in excess of the $1,000,000 cap, provided that the exception has been approved by the EPA\nAward Official (either through the Recipient's workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement or\nthrough separate post-award approval).\nWaste, Fraud, or Abuse: For the definition and application of these terms under this Assistance\nAgreement (e.g. the Financial Risk Management Requirements, Clarifications to EPA General Terms\nand Conditions, and Financial Agent Terms and Conditions) and any associated legal documentation\nrelated to the Assistance Agreement, refer to their use in the Reporting Waste, Fraud, and Abuse clause\nin the EPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024 and 2 CFR 200.113: “credible\nevidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest,\nbribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False\nClaims Act 31 U.S.C. 3729-3733.”\nII. NATIONAL PROGRAMMATIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nA. Performance Reporting\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.329 and 2 CFR 200.337, the Recipient agrees to the following four\nrequirements of performance reporting: (1) progress reports, (2) transaction and-project level report, (3)\norganizational disclosures, and (4) ongoing disclosures. These performance reporting requirements\n“flow-down” as needed to enable the Recipient to comply with the requirements described in this term\nand condition. The Recipient must ensure that these reports cover its own grant-related activities and,\nwhere applicable to a certain performance report or element of a performance report, the grant-related\nactivities of its Subrecipients, Contractors, and/or Program Beneficiaries. To comply with these\nperformance reporting requirements, the Recipient agrees to use information collection instruments\nauthorized by GGRF Accomplishment Reporting (\n), once such instruments are authorized; to the extent that information is not available for\ntransactions that were closed prior to authorization of these instruments, the Recipient will not be out of\ncompliance with the performance reporting requirements.\nThe Recipient agrees to have its chief executive officer (or equivalent) and chief reporting officer (or\nequivalent) review, sign, and submit performance reporting electronically to the EPA Project Officer. To\nthe extent it is known, or should have been known, by the chief executive officer (or equivalent) and chief\nreporting officer (or equivalent) that the reporting is not materially compliant with the terms and\nconditions, or demonstrates material noncompliance with the terms and conditions, the chief executive\nofficer (or equivalent) and chief reporting officer (or equivalent) must note such noncompliance to the\nEPA Project Officer alongside the submission. Should the chief executive officer (or equivalent) and chief\nreporting officer (or equivalent) signing the submission knowingly and willfully make any material false\nstatement, they may be subject to criminal prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and/or other civil and\nComplaint Exhibit A at 14\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 62 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 15\nadministrative sanctions.\nEPA intends to make performance reporting information available to the public, either in whole or in part,\nthrough disclosing copies of the reports as submitted or using the content of the reports to prepare EPA\nreporting documents. Pursuant to 2 CFR 200.338, the Recipient agrees to redact personally identifiable\ninformation (PII) and mark confidential business information (CBI) prior to submission to EPA.\nInformation claimed as CBI will be disclosed only to the extent, and by means of the procedures, set forth\nin 40 CFR Part 2, Subpart B. As provided at 40 CFR 2.203(b), if no claim of confidential treatment\naccompanies the information when it is received by EPA, it may be made available to the public by EPA\nwithout further notice to the Recipient. Recipient agrees that submitted information that does not include\nPII or CBI may be shared for program evaluation purposes, including with third parties.\nThe EPA Project Officer may extend the due date for performance reporting requirements to the extent\nauthorized by 2 CFR 200.329 and 2 CFR 200.344. On a case-by-case basis, the EPA Project Officer\nmay waive or modify performance reporting requirements to the extent authorized by 2 CFR 200.329 and\n2 CFR 200.344. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Assistance Agreement, if Recipient's inability\nto submit the required performance reporting is due to issues with EPA systems, the Recipient shall be\ngranted a reasonable extension to submit the reports after the technical issue has been corrected.\nWhere applicable, the intervals for reporting are authorized by 2 CFR 200.329(c)(1), as more frequent\nreporting is necessary for the effective monitoring of the Federal award and could significantly affect\nprogram outcomes.\n1. Progress Reports\nSemi-Annual Report\nThe Recipient agrees to submit semi-annual reports covering six months of the calendar year in\naccordance with information collection instruments approved through GGRF Accomplishment Reporting\n( ). A single semi-annual report must be\nsubmitted to cover grant-related activities of the Recipient as well as Subrecipients as well as the grant-\nrelated activities of its Contractors and/or Program Beneficiaries where applicable to a certain element of\nthe semi-annual report.\nThe Recipient agrees to submit semi-annual reports electronically to the EPA Project Officer within 30\ncalendar days after the semi-annual reporting period ends.

Leveraging\nThe Recipient agrees to make commercially reasonable efforts to provide the proposed leveraged\nfunding that is described in its workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement. If the proposed\nleveraging does not substantially materialize during the Period of Performance, and the Recipient does\nnot provide a satisfactory explanation, the Agency may consider this factor in evaluating future grant\napplications from the Recipient. In addition, if the proposed leveraging does not substantially materialize\nduring the Period of Performance and the Recipient does not provide a satisfactory explanation, then\nEPA may reconsider the legitimacy of the award; if EPA determines that the Recipient knowingly or\nrecklessly provided inaccurate information regarding the leveraged funding described in the workplan in\neffect under this Assistance Agreement, EPA may take action as authorized by 2 CFR Part 200 and/or 2\nCFR Part 180 as applicable.\n2.

These documented reviews shall be\nmade available to the sponsoring EPA organization if requested. When necessary, the Recipient shall\nrevise its QMP to incorporate minor changes and notify the EPA PO and QAM of the changes. If\nsignificant changes have been made to the Quality Program that affect the performance of environmental\ninformation operations, it may be necessary to re-submit the entire QMP for re-approval. In general, a\ncopy of any QMP revision(s) made during the year should be submitted to the EPA PO and QAM in\nwriting when such changes occur. Conditions requiring the revision and resubmittal of an approved QMP\ncan be found in section 6 of EPA's Quality Management Plan (QMP) Standard. \n2. Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)\nComplaint Exhibit A at 20\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 68 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 21\nPrior to beginning Environmental Information Operations necessary to comply with the requirements\nspecified in the Performance Reporting Programmatic Term and Condition, the Recipient must: (i)\ndevelop a QAPP, (ii) prepare the QAPP in accordance with the current version of EPA's Quality\nAssurance Project Plan (QAPP) Standard, (iii) submit the document for EPA review, and (iv) obtain EPA\nQuality Assurance Manager or designee (hereafter referred to as QAM) approval. Alternatively, the\nRecipient may (i) submit a previously EPA-approved QAPP proposed to ensure the collected, produced,\nevaluated, or used environmental information is of known and documented quality for the intended use(s)\nand (ii) the EPA Quality Assurance Manager or designee (hereafter referred to as QAM) will notify the\nRecipient and EPA Project Officer (PO) in writing if the previously EPA-approved QAPP is acceptable for\nthis agreement.\nThe Recipient must submit the QAPP within 90 calendar days after grant award, unless the Recipient\nrequests an extension(s) that is granted by the QAM.\nThe Recipient must notify the PO and QAM when substantive changes are needed to the QAPP. EPA\nmay require the QAPP be updated and re-submitted for approval.\nThe Recipient must review their approved QAPP at least annually. The results of the QAPP review and\nany revisions must be submitted to the PO and the QAM at least annually and may also be submitted\nwhen changes occur.\nFor Reference:\n• Quality Management Plan (QMP) Standard and EPA's Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP)\nStandard; contain quality specifications for EPA and non-EPA organizations and definitions applicable to\nthese terms and conditions.\n• EPA QA/G-5: Guidance for Quality Assurance Project Plans.\n• EPA's Quality Program website has a list of QA managers, and Specifications for EPA and Non-EPA\nOrganizations.\n• The Office of Grants and Debarment Implementation of Quality Assurance Requirements for\nOrganizations Receiving EPA Financial Assistance.\nH. Real Property \nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.311, title to Real Property acquired or improved under this agreement will\nvest upon acquisition by the Recipient, including but not limited to title to Real Property acquired through\nexercise of a remedy for default of a Financial Assistance arrangement. This Real Property must be used\nfor the originally authorized purpose as long as needed for that purpose, during which time the Recipient\nmust not dispose of or encumber its title or other interests. The Real Property Programmatic Term and\nCondition flows down to Subrecipients but not to Program Beneficiaries or Contractors that receive\nFinancial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects, which may acquire title to Real Property after receiving\nFinancial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects.\nThe Recipient must obtain prior approval from the EPA Award Official for the acquisition of Real\nProperty. Note that the Recipient may meet this requirement by specifying the types of acquisitions of\nReal Property it plans to carry out in its workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 21\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 69 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 22\nDisposition\nIf the Recipient disposes of the Real Property and uses the proceeds for the originally authorized\npurpose (i.e., under the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement), then the proceeds will be treated\nas Program Income and there are no further disposition requirements.\nOtherwise, when Real Property is no longer needed for the originally authorized purpose, the Recipient\nmust obtain disposition instructions from EPA. The instructions will provide for one of the following\nalternatives:\n1. Retain title after compensating EPA. The amount paid to EPA will be computed by applying\nEPA's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and costs of any\nimprovements) to the fair market value of the property. However, in those situations where\nRecipient is disposing of Real Property acquired or improved with a Federal award and acquiring\nreplacement Real Property under the same Federal award, the net proceeds from the disposition\nmay be used as an offset to the cost of the replacement property.\n2. Sell the property and compensate EPA. The amount due to EPA will be calculated by applying\nEPA's percentage of participation in the cost of the original purchase (and cost of any\nimprovements) to the proceeds of the sale after deduction of any actual and reasonable selling\nand fixing-up expenses. If the Federal award has not been closed out, the net proceeds from sale\nmay be offset against the original cost of the property. When the Recipient is directed to sell\nproperty, sales procedures must be followed that provide for competition to the extent practicable\nand result in the highest possible return.\n3. Transfer title to EPA or to a third party designated/approved by EPA. The Recipient is entitled\nto be paid an amount calculated by applying the Recipient's percentage of participation in the\npurchase of the Real Property (and cost of any improvements) to the current fair market value of\nthe property.\nRecordation\nAs authorized by 2 CFR 200.316, EPA requires that Recipients who use EPA funding to purchase and\nimprove Real Property through an EPA funded construction project record a lien or similar notice in the\nReal Property records for the jurisdiction in which the Real Property is located, which indicates that the\nReal Property has been acquired and improved with federal funding and that use and disposition\nconditions apply to the Real Property. \nI. Program Income \nIn accordance with Clean Air Act Section 134(b)(1)(C) as well as 2 CFR 200.307(c) and 2 CFR 1500.8\n(b), the Recipient must retain Program Income earned during the Period of Performance. Program\nIncome will be added to funds committed to the program by EPA and used for the purposes and under\nthe conditions of the Assistance Agreement and beyond the Period of Performance based on a Closeout\nAgreement.\nIn any period of time before such a Closeout Agreement is effective but after the Recipient has fully used\nthe award for allowable activities, the Recipient is authorized to use Program Income under the terms\nand conditions of the Assistance Agreement, as opposed to the terms and conditions outlined under the\nComplaint Exhibit A at 22\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 70 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 23\nCloseout Agreement Programmatic Term and Condition. The terms and conditions outlined under the\nCloseout Agreement Programmatic Term and Condition will supplant the terms and conditions of the\nAssistance Agreement once the Closeout Agreement becomes effective.\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 1500.8(d) as supplemented by the Period of Performance Programmatic Term\nand Condition, under ordinary circumstances, the Recipient may only use Program Income once the\ninitial award funds are fully used for allowable activities or the Period of Performance ends for a different\nreason. However, Program Income may be used by the Recipient in advance of the initial award funds\nbeing fully used where reasonable and necessary to execute the activities in the workplan in effect under\nthis Assistance Agreement.\nJ. Use of Logos\nIf the EPA logo is appearing along with logos from other participating entities on websites, outreach\nmaterials, or reports, it must not be prominently displayed to imply that any of the Recipient or\nSubrecipient's activities are being conducted by the EPA. Instead, the EPA logo should be accompanied\nwith a statement indicating that the Recipient received financial support from the EPA under an\nAssistance Agreement. More information is available at: https://www.epa.gov/stylebook/using-epa-seal-\nand-logo#policy.\nIII. ADDITIONAL PROGRAMMATIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nA.

This requirement applies to the entire award provided to\nthe Recipient and “flows down” to each Subrecipient.\nH. Subgrants to For-Profit Entities\nThe Recipient is authorized to provide Subgrants to for-profit entities if and only if those Subgrants are\nprovided to an entity that has been determined by the U.S. Treasury's CDFI Fund to meet the CDFI\ncertification requirements set forth in 12 CFR 1805.201, the framework for awarding Subgrants to such\nfor-profit entities is described in the Recipient's workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement, and\nthe for-profit entity meets the definition of a Community Lender.

Capitalization Funding\nAs stated in the definition of Capitalization Funding, the Recipient will provide Capitalization Funding\nSubawards to Community Lenders in the form of Subgrants, which are subject to the EPA Subaward\nPolicy. The following additional requirements apply when the Recipient provides Capitalization Funding\nto Community Lenders.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 26\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 74 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 27\n1. Disclosure and Approval Requirements\n1. The Recipient must obtain written approval from the EPA Award Official prior to providing\nCapitalization Funding to a Community Lender Subrecipient that would exceed the cap of\n$10,000,000 in Capitalization Funding under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator. If\nthe exception has been approved by the EPA Award Official in the Recipient's workplan in effect\nunder this Assistance Agreement, then no additional approval is required.\n2. Prior to providing Capitalization Funding to a Community Lender Subrecipient, the Recipient\nmust obtain disclosure from the Community Lender regarding award funds that it has sought\nand/or received under the National Clean Investment and Clean Communities Investment\nAccelerator programs.\n2. Revolving Loan Fund Characterization\nCapitalization Funding Subgrants are made for the sole purpose of providing Financial Assistance to\nCCIA-Eligible Projects. As stated in the definition of Financial Assistance, expenditures for Financial\nAssistance are in the form of Subawards, Participant Support Costs, and Acquisitions of Intangible\nProperty, as defined in this Award Agreement. EPA considers all Capitalization Funding Subgrants to be\ncapitalizations of revolving loan funds for the purposes of 2 CFR 1500.8(d).\n3. Participant Support Costs\nThe Community Lender may provide Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects in the form of\nParticipant Support Costs. The Recipient agrees to impose the following eligibility, restrictions, timelines,\nand other programmatic requirements on Community Lenders payments of Participant Support Costs, in\naddition to other requirements included in the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement:\n1. The Community Lender and Program Beneficiaries are responsible for taxes, if any, on\npayments made to or on behalf of entities participating in this program that are allowable as\nParticipant Support Costs under 2 CFR 200.1, 2 CFR 200.456, or 2 CFR 1500.1. EPA\nencourages the Community Lender and Program Beneficiaries to consult their tax advisers, the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Service, or state and local tax authorities regarding the taxability of\nsubsidies, rebates, and other Participant Support Cost payments. However, EPA does not\nprovide advice on tax issues relating to these payments.\n2. Participant Support Cost payments are lower tiered covered Nonprocurement transactions for\nthe purposes of 2 CFR 180.300 and the Suspension and Debarment General Term and\nCondition. The Community Lender, therefore, may not make Participant Support Cost payments\nto entities excluded from participation in Federal Nonprocurement programs under 2 CFR Part\n180 and must ensure that Community Lenders adhere to this requirement as well. The\nCommunity Lender is responsible for checking that Program Beneficiaries (i.e., entities receiving\nParticipant Support Costs) are not excluded from participation through either (1) checking the\nSystem for Award Management (SAM) or (2) obtaining eligibility certifications from the Program\nBeneficiaries.\nThe Recipient agrees to provide written guidelines for Community Lenders' payments of Participant\nSupport Costs to the EPA Project Officer prior to the Community Lenders' making payments to Program\nBeneficiaries, unless already described in the Recipient's workplan in effect under this Assistance\nComplaint Exhibit A at 27\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 75 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 28\nAgreement. These guidelines must: (a) describe the activities that will be supported by the Participant\nSupport Costs; (b) specify the range of funding to be provided through the Participant Support Costs; (c)\nidentify which types of entities will have title to equipment (if any) purchased with the funds; (d) establish\nsource documentation requirements (e.g., invoices) for accounting records; and (e) describe purchasing\ncontrols to ensure that the amount of the Participant Support Cost is determined in a commercially\nreasonable manner as required by 2 CFR 200.404.\n4. Acquisitions of Intangible Property\n2 CFR 200 Procurement Standards\nThe Community Lender may use its Capitalization Funding to provide Financial Assistance to CCIA-\nEligible Projects in the form of Acquisitions of Intangible Property. The Community Lender agrees to\nacquire Intangible Property in compliance with the conflict of interest and competition requirements\ndescribed in the 2 CFR Part 200 Procurement Standards. This includes but is not limited to the\nrequirements at 2 CFR 200.318 to:\nHave and use documented procurement procedures to govern Acquisitions of Intangible\nProperty;\nMaintain oversight to ensure that contractors perform in accordance with the terms, conditions,\nand specifications of their contracts;\nMaintain written standards of conduct covering conflicts of interest and governing the actions of\nemployees engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts as well as maintain\nwritten standards of conduct covering organizational conflicts of interest;\nPrioritize entering into inter-entity agreements where appropriate for procurement or use of\ncommon or shared goods and services as the Recipient seeks to mobilize financing and private\ncapital;\nAward contracts only to responsible contractors possessing the ability to perform successfully\nunder the terms and conditions of the proposed procurement; and\nMaintain records sufficient to detail the history of procurement.\nDisposition\nIf the Community Lender disposes of the Intangible Property and uses the proceeds for the originally\nauthorized purpose (i.e., under the terms and conditions of the Subaward Agreement), then the proceeds\nwill be treated as Program Income and there are no further disposition requirements.\nRecordation\nThe Community Lender agrees to record liens or other appropriate notices of record to indicate that\nIntangible Property has been acquired with Federal funding and that use and disposition conditions apply\nto the Intangible Property, in cases where Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects is in the form of\nan Acquisition of Intangible Property. As provided in 2 CFR 200.1: “…loans, notes and other debt\ninstruments, lease agreements, stock and other instruments of property ownership (whether the property\nis tangible or intangible)” are Intangible Property for the purposes of the restrictions described at 2 CFR\n200.315(a). “Other appropriate notices of record” is not limited to filing Uniform Commercial Code\ninstruments and may also include a notice of record in the legally-binding transaction documents.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 28\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 76 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 29\n5. Subawards to Financial Intermediary Subrecipients\nThe following requirements apply when a Community Lender provides a Subaward to a Financial\nIntermediary Subrecipient. These requirements apply to the Recipient and Subrecipient in lieu of those\nspecified in the Establishing and Managing Subawards General Term and Condition. As stated in the\ndefinition of Financial Assistance, Subgrants are not an eligible form of Financial Assistance:\n1. The Community Lender must establish and follow a system that ensures all Subawards to\nFinancial Intermediary Subrecipients are in writing and contain all of the elements required by 2\nCFR 200.332(b), with the exception of the indirect cost provision of 2 CFR 200.332(b)(4) (which\ndoes not apply to loans). EPA has developed an optional template for Subaward Agreements\navailable in Appendix D of the EPA Subaward Policy, which may also be used for such Subaward\nAgreements with Financial Intermediary Subrecipients.\n2. The Financial Intermediary Subrecipient must comply with the internal control requirements\nspecified at 2 CFR 200.303 and is subject to the 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart F, Audit Requirements.\nThe pass-through entity must include a condition in all Subawards that requires Financial\nIntermediary Subrecipients to comply with these requirements. No other provisions of the Uniform\nGrant Guidance, including the Procurement Standards, apply directly to the Subrecipient.\n3. Prior to making the Subaward, the Community Lender must ensure that the Financial\nIntermediary Subrecipient has a “unique entity identifier.” This identifier is required for registering\nin the System for Award Management (SAM) and by 2 CFR Part 25 and 2 CFR 200.332(b)(1).\nThe unique entity identifier (UEI) is generated when an entity registers in SAM. Information on\nregistering in SAM and obtaining a UEI is available in the General Condition of the pass-through\nentity's agreement with EPA entitled “System for Award Management and Universal Identifier\nRequirements.”\nJ. Technical Assistance Subawards\nAs stated in the definition of Technical Assistance Subawards, the Recipient will provide Technical\nAssistance Subawards to Community Lenders in the form of Subgrants, which are subject to the EPA\nSubaward Policy. As such, the Establishing and Managing Subawards General Term and Conditions\napplies to Technical Assistance Subawards.\nThe following additional requirements apply when the Recipient provides Technical Assistance\nSubawards to Community Lenders:\n1. The Recipient must obtain prior written approval from the EPA Award Official for any Technical\nAssistance Subaward that exceeds $1,000,000 in EPA funds. If the exception has been approved\nby the EPA Award Official in the Recipient's workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement,\nthen no additional approval is required.\n2. Prior to providing a Technical Assistance Subaward to a Community Lender, the Recipient\nmust obtain disclosure from the Community Lender regarding award funds that it has sought\nand/or received under the National Clean Investment and Clean Communities Investment\nAccelerator programs.\nThe above requirements apply specifically to Technical Assistance Subawards but do not apply to\nComplaint Exhibit A at 29\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 77 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 30\nTechnical Assistance Services, which are allowable expenditures the Recipient may incur in accordance\nwith the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement and the requirements for allowability under 2\nCFR Part 200, Subpart E as well as applicable provisions of 2 CFR Part 1500.\nK. Labor and Equitable Workforce Development Requirements\n1. Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA)\nA. Program Applicability\nAs provided in Section 314 of the Clean Air Act (42 USC § 7614) (DBRA), Davis-Bacon Act (42 USC §§\n3141-3144) labor standards apply to projects assisted by grants and cooperative agreements made\nunder the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Accordingly, all laborers and mechanics employed by\ncontractors or subcontractors on projects assisted under this Award Agreement shall be paid wages at\nrates not less than those prevailing for the same type of work on similar construction in the locality as\ndetermined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with 40 USC Subtitle II, Part A, Chapter 31,\nSubchapter IV (Wage Rate Requirements). Under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the relevant\nconstruction type and prevailing wage classifications would be “Building” and “Residential.” The\nSecretary of Labor's wage determinations are available at https://sam.gov/content/wage-determinations.\nUnder the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Davis-Bacon and Related Act requirements apply to forms\nof Financial Assistance that directly fund and are directly linked to specific construction projects that were\nnot completed prior to the execution of the final binding documentation governing the use of the Financial\nAssistance. The Recipient must ensure that any construction work financed in whole or in part with such\nFinancial Assistance, as defined in these Terms and Conditions, provided under this agreement complies\nwith Davis-Bacon and Related Act requirements and the requirements of these Terms and Conditions.\nNote, however, that under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Davis-Bacon and Related Act\nrequirements do not apply to any form of Financial Assistance which meets any of the following criteria:\nFinancial Assistance which exclusively funds pre-construction (e.g. permitting or design work) or\npost-construction activities (e.g. Acquiring Intangible Property related to a previously completed\nconstruction project or re-financing activity related to a previously completed construction\nproject).\nFinancial Assistance which serves end-users who are individual homeowners or tenants of\nsingle-family homes or multifamily buildings when these individual end-users ultimately select the\ncontractor(s) and execute the contract(s) for the construction work, as opposed to the Recipient,\nSubrecipient, or a contractor hired by the Recipient or Subrecipient.\nFinancial Assistance which serves end-users who meet the definition of Federally Recognized\nTribal Entities, as defined under this Assistance Agreement, when these Federally Recognized\nTribal Entities ultimately select the contractor(s) and execute the contract(s) for the construction\nwork, as opposed to the Recipient, Subrecipient, or a contractor hired by the Recipient or\nSubrecipient.\nFinancial Assistance which serves any end-user when such Financial Assistance is less than\n$250,000 for a project and the end-user ultimately selects the contractor(s) and executes the\ncontract(s) for the construction work, as opposed to the Recipient, Subrecipient, or a contractor\nhired by the Recipient or Subrecipient.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 30\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 78 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 31\nIf the Recipient encounters a situation that presents uncertainties regarding DBRA applicability under this\nAssistance Agreement, the Recipient must discuss the situation with the EPA Project Officer before\nauthorizing work on the project.  \nIn the event that a periodic project site visit, audit, or routine communication with a Subrecipient,\nProgram Beneficiary, contractor, or subcontractor determines any instances of non-compliance or\npotential non-compliance with the requirements of this Term and Condition or the Davis-Bacon and\nRelated Act, the Recipient agrees to promptly inform the EPA Project Officer for possible referral to the\nU.S. Department of Labor for guidance or enforcement action.   \nNote, the use of the term project in this term and condition is distinct from the use of the term project\nwithin the definition of Qualified Project under Clean Air Act Section 134(c)(3), which is broader and\nincludes “any project, activity, or technology.” Consistent with the definitions at 29 CFR § 5.2, the term\n“construction” refers to all types of work done on a particular building or work at the site of the work by\nlaborers and mechanics employed by a contractor or subcontractor. Additional guidance is available in\nthe definition of the term “building or work” in 29 CFR § 5.2.\nB. Davis-Bacon and Related Acts\nDavis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) is a collection of labor standards provisions administered by the\nDepartment of Labor, that are applicable to grants involving construction. These labor standards include\nthe:\nDavis-Bacon Act, which requires payment of prevailing wage rates for laborers and mechanics on\nconstruction contracts of $2,000 or more;\nCopeland “Anti-Kickback” Act, which prohibits a contractor or subcontractor from inducing an\nemployee into giving up any part of the compensation to which he or she is entitled; and\nContract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, which requires overtime wages to be paid for\nover 40 hours of work per week, under contracts in excess of $100,000.\nC.

DBRA Compliance Monitoring Requirement\nReasonable and necessary costs for DBRA compliance are allowable and allocable grant costs. Such\ncosts include, but are not limited to, the procurement of a payroll reporting and compliance management\nsoftware product to meet the documentation and reporting requirements under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(ii) for all\nconstruction projects assisted under this award.\n2. Compliance with Federal Statutes and Regulations\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with other applicable federal statutes and regulations related to labor\nand equitable workforce development as well as to enforce compliance with Subrecipients, contractors,\nand other partners (e.g., by including such provisions in contractual agreements). This includes but is not\nlimited to applicable health and safety regulations as administered by the Occupational Safety and\nHealth Administration.\n3. Free and Fair Choice to Join a Union\nIn accordance with Executive Order 14082 (Implementation of the Energy and Infrastructure Provisions\nof the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022), the Recipient agrees to design and implement a policy to increase\nhigh-quality job opportunities for American workers and improving equitable access to these jobs,\nincluding in traditional energy communities, through the timely implementation of requirements for\nprevailing wages and registered apprenticeships and by focusing on high labor standards and the free\nand fair chance to join a union.\nIn accordance with the EPA General Terms and Conditions, grant funds may not be used to support or\noppose union organizing, whether directly or as an offset for other funds.\n4.

Build America, Buy America Act\nThe Build America, Buy America Act – Public Law 117-58, requires the EPA to ensure that for any\nactivity related to the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of infrastructure, “none of the funds\nmade available for a Federal Financial Assistance program for infrastructure, including each deficient\nprogram, may be obligated for a project unless all of the iron, steel, manufactured products, and\nconstruction materials used in the project are produced in the United States.” (P.L. 117-58, Secs 70911 –\n70917).\nThe Recipient is bound to the EPA Build America, Buy America General Term and Condition, which\noutlines the Build America, Buy America (BABA) requirements that all Recipients of EPA Financial\nAssistance awards must comply with.\nUnder the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, BABA requirements apply to forms of Financial Assistance\nthat directly fund and are directly linked to specific infrastructure projects that were not completed prior to\nthe date the Recipient's award funds were obligated by the EPA.\nEPA interprets the definition of infrastructure consistent with 2 CFR 184 and M-24-02 (memorandum\ndated as of October 23, 2023) including the “public function” test, when determining whether projects\nqualify as public infrastructure, based on the Civil Rights Act definition of public accommodation.\nThe following types of Greenhouse Gas Reduction projects are deemed infrastructure for the purposes of\nBABA applicability:\nComplaint Exhibit A at 34\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 82 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 35\n1. The public infrastructure portion of any property (e.g., retail in a mixed-use multi-family\nproperty) where the principal purpose of the Financial Assistance is to directly benefit such\nportion of the property;\n2. Privately-owned commercial buildings when they meet the “public function” test;\n3. Residential-serving community solar projects, which EPA deems “structures, facilities, and\nequipment that generate, transport, and distribute energy” per 2 CFR 184.4(c);\n4. Publicly accessible EV charging stations;\n5. Publicly owned energy generation and/or storage transportation facilities;\n6. Publicly owned transportation facilities (e.g., bus depot);\n7. Privately-owned transportation facilities that serve a public function.\nThe following types of Greenhouse Gas Reduction projects are not deemed infrastructure for the\npurposes of BABA applicability:\n1. Privately-owned vehicles for private use;\n2. Certain publicly-owned or operated vehicles that EPA has determined do not constitute\ninfrastructure (e.g. school buses);\n3. Privately-owned manufacturing or industrial facilities;\n4. Privately-owned offices;\n5. Single family homes;\n6. Privately-owned, non-mixed-use, multi-family housing properties;\n7. Privately-owned residential portions of mixed-use properties;\n8. EV charging stations that are not publicly accessible;\n9. Any privately-owned, behind-the-meter energy generation and storage project that does not\notherwise meet the definition of infrastructure.\nThe inclusion of the following types of funding, support, guarantee, or sponsorship in the funding stack of\nany Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund project does not trigger BABA, in and of itself or in combination:\n1. Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC);\n2. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Backed Multifamily Mortgages;\n3. Federal Housing Administration Insured Multifamily Mortgages;\nComplaint Exhibit A at 35\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 83 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 36\n4. HUD Section 8 Funding;\n5. Other Federal, State, Tribal, or Local Housing Assistance Funding Sources: in general,\nsubsidies issued by federal, state, tribal, or local housing assistance funding sources that do not\nconfer equity or ownership stakes for the governmental funding source do not trigger BABA\napplicability.\nBABA applicability is assessed at the time of provision of Financial Assistance based on the terms,\nlimitations, and requirements of the Financial Assistance. Applicability does not change retroactively\nbased on a change of use (e.g., if a ground floor apartment is re-zoned for a restaurant). Recipients may\nnot temporarily modify or mischaracterize usage to intentionally avoid BABA compliance.\nIf the Recipient encounters a situation that presents uncertainties regarding Build America, Buy America\napplicability under this Assistance Agreement, the Recipient must discuss the situation with the EPA\nProject Officer before authorizing work on the project.\nM. Governance Requirements\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the following governance requirements starting December 31, 2024.\nThe governance requirements “flow-down” to Pass-Through Subrecipients and Community Lender\nSubrecipients that have received in excess of $10,000,000 in Capitalization Funding but not to other\nsubrecipients. The governance requirements are waived for (i) any entity that has been determined by\nthe U.S. Treasury's CDFI Fund to meet the CDFI certification requirements set forth in 12 CFR 1805.201\nand (ii) any entity whose specific governance structure is set forth in State, Tribal, or local law.\nThe Recipient (or Subrecipient) may meet all or some of the governance requirements through the\nparent entity, provided the Recipient (or Subrecipient) is subject to the governance of the parent entity\nand the Recipient (or Subrecipient) is wholly-controlled by the parent entity. Similarly, the governance\nrequirements may be waived for the Recipient (or Subrecipient) through the parent entity meeting the\nCDFI certification requirements set forth in 12 CFR 1805.201, provided the Recipient (or Subrecipient) is\nwholly-controlled by the parent entity.\n1. Board Size and Composition\nThe Recipient agrees to ensure that its board size in terms of number of members (excluding advisory\ncommittees) is commensurate with the scope of oversight and monitoring activities as well as the scale,\ncomplexity, and risk profile of the Recipient's workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement as well\nas other business activities. The board must have a sufficient number of members to adequately staff\neach of its\ncommittees.             \nThe Recipient agrees to ensure that its board consists of members that are qualified with relevant\nexpertise, skills, and track record as well as representative members (including from Low-Income and\nDisadvantaged Communities). \n2. Board Independence\nThe Recipient agrees to ensure that the majority of the board is independent, in accordance with the\nInternal Revenue Service's definition of “independent” for the purposes of Form 990 reporting.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 36\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 84 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 37\n3. Board Committees\nThe Recipient agrees to have the following board-level committees to oversee and monitor management,\nwith each committee staffed by members qualified to execute the committee's objectives. While the\nRecipient need not adhere to the exact naming convention or structure in this term and condition, each of\nthe responsibilities must be covered by board-level committees at all times during the Period of\nPerformance; for the avoidance of doubt, one committee may perform the responsibilities of one or more\nof the committees specified below.\n1. An investment or credit committee to oversee and approve investment or credit decisions;\n2. A risk management committee to oversee the formulation and operationalization of the risk\nmanagement framework;\n3. An audit committee to oversee the integrity of reporting and internal controls and the\nperformance of audit functions, with a majority independent members on such committee;\n4. A nomination/governance committee to oversee nomination and succession of board and\nsenior management, with a majority independent members on such committee; and\n5. A compensation committee to oversee board as well as senior management and staff\ncompensation, with a majority independent members on such committee.\nFurther, the Recipient agrees to act in good faith to ensure each committee obtains information from\nmanagement, auditors, or other third-parties necessary to discharge their duties.\n4. Board Policies and Procedures\nThe Recipient agrees to enforce board policies and procedures including, among others, those that\nensure strong ethics and mitigate conflicts of interest; ensure appropriate board training to review and\nassess internal risk assessments for all of the organization's significant activities; and ensure regular\nboard engagement, including frequency of meetings and attendance procedures.\nThe Recipient agrees to require recusals from any officers or members of the board of directors with a\npersonal or organizational conflict of interest in the decision-making and management related to financial\ntransactions under this award. Such recusals must include but not be limited to decision-making and\nmanagement of Capitalization Funding, Technical Assistance Subawards, and other Subawards to any\norganization in which an officer or member of the board of directors or their immediate family is directly\nemployed by or has a consulting or other contractual relationship with, serves on the board, or is\notherwise affiliated with the organization. The term “immediate family” has the same meaning as that\nterm in the EPA's Final Financial Assistance Conflict of Interest Policy.\nN. Consumer Protection Requirements\nThe Recipient agrees to carry out the following consumer protection requirements to the extent that the\nRecipient directly interacts, transacts, or contracts with consumers in the provision of Financial\nAssistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects:\n1. Comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Consumer\nComplaint Exhibit A at 37\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 85 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 38\nFinancial Protection Act, and other federal consumer protection laws that apply;\n2. Provide written disclosures to consumers containing information in clear and understandable\nlanguage regarding purchasing, leasing, or financing as well as the costs associated with a\nconsumer's transaction;\n3. With regard to solar products or services, provide written disclosures on the impact of the solar\nproject on the consumer's ability to sell or refinance their home and recording of any liens on the\nhome; consumer rights; contact information for the solar project provider; and complaint\nprocedures for the consumer if they have a problem with the solar project or sales process;\n4.

Financial Risk Management Requirements\n1a. Cash Management Requirements: Advance Payments\nThe Recipient must deposit and maintain advance payments of Federal funds exclusively in insured\naccounts, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305(b)(10). As provided in 2 CFR 200.1, an advance payment\nis “a payment that a Federal agency or pass-through entity makes by any appropriate payment\nmechanism and payment method before the recipient or subrecipient disburses the funds for program\npurposes.” A Recipient drawing down funds from ASAP prior to disbursement for actual and allowable\nproject costs constitutes an advance payment. Interest income earned on the advance payment from\nEPA to the Recipient prior to disbursement is subject to the requirements on interest earned within 2\nCFR 200.305(b)(11) and 2 CFR 200.305(b)(12); consequently, such interest earned in excess of $500\nmust be remitted annually to the Department of Health and Human Services Payment Management\nSystem.\n1b. Cash Management Requirements: Program Income\nThe Recipient is authorized to maintain Program Income in two types of accounts:\n1.

Accounts where such income is used to purchase (i) U.S. Savings Bonds, U.S. Treasury\nMarketable Securities, and U.S. Agency Marketable Securities, provided the duration of such\ninstruments is no longer than 90 calendar days (if purchased directly) and that such instruments\nare held-to-maturity (if purchased directly), or (ii) short-term money market funds consisting solely\nof the aforementioned investment instruments and offering daily investor redemptions. Note, the\nunderlying instruments included in a short-term money market fund consisting solely of U.S.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 38\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 86 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 39\nSavings Bonds, U.S. Treasury Marketable Securities, and U.S. Agency Marketable Securities\nand offering daily investor redemptions need not be of a particular duration or held-to-maturity.\nInterest income and other returns earned on funds that have already been disbursed is considered\nadditional Program Income consistent with 2 CFR 1500.8(d) and is not subject to the requirements on\ninterest earned within 2 CFR 200.305(b)(11) and 2 CFR 200.305(b)(12).\n2. Financial Health Metrics\nThe Recipient agrees to report the following financial health metrics at the entity-level on an annual basis\nin accordance with its fiscal year as well as on behalf of each Pass-Through Subrecipient and\nSubrecipient Community Lender that has received in excess of $10,000,000 in Capitalization Funding.\nThe metrics are due to the EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar days after submission of the reporting\nentity's Single Audit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse's Internet Data Entry System and may be\nsubmitted through the Organizational Disclosures form. The requirement for submission of financial\nhealth metrics is not applicable for any fiscal year in which the reporting entity did not meet the\nrequirements of 2 CFR Subpart F—Audit Requirements.  The first financial health metrics are due in\n2025.\n1. Net Asset Ratio: The net asset ratio is defined as net assets divided by total assets.\n2. Current Ratio: The current ratio is defined as current assets divided by current liabilities, where\ncurrent assets is equal to the value of all assets that are reasonably expected to be converted\ninto cash within the coming 12-month period in the normal course of business and current\nliabilities is equal to the total value of all debts or obligations that must be paid in the coming 12-\nmonth period.\n3. Delinquency Rate: The delinquency rate is defined as the value of loans outstanding that are\n90+ calendar days delinquent divided by the value of loans outstanding, where loans 90+\ncalendar days delinquent includes those with outstanding balances 90+ calendar days overdue\nand still accruing interest as well as those in nonaccrual status.\n4. Net Charge-Off Rate: The net charge-off rate is defined as the value of loans charged-off over\nthe past fiscal year, minus the value of loan recoveries over the past fiscal year, divided by the\nvalue of loans outstanding.\n5. Concentration: The concentration of the portfolio, as demonstrated by calculating and reporting\non recipient-level exposure, defined as on-balance sheet exposures to a single consolidated\nentity over all on-balance sheet exposures, for top ten highest exposures.\nNote, the Delinquency Rate and Net Charge-Off Rate may exclude the value of loans which include an\nelement of forgiveness, if and only if such forgiveness was established in the terms governing the\nfinancial product at origination.\nThe EPA Project Officer will consider Recipient and, where applicable, Subrecipient performance against\nthese financial health metrics only to the extent by which they Materially Impair the Recipient's ability to\nexecute the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement when assessing whether the Recipient\nis making sufficient progress in implementing the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement, as\nspecified in the Sufficient Progress clause under the Clarifications to EPA General Terms and Conditions\nProgrammatic Term and Condition.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 39\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 87 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 40\n3. Climate-Related Financial Risks\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management). This may include\nworking with Community Lender Subrecipients to account for and evaluate practicable alternatives or\nother mitigation related to ameliorating flood risks and protecting flood plains as part of their financial risk\nmanagement policies and procedures.\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with Executive Order 14030 (Climate-Related Financial Risk). This may\ninclude working with Community Lender Subrecipients to account for climate-related financial risks,\nincluding physical and transition risks, including through providing Technical Assistance Services that\nassist Community Lender Subrecipients with accounting for such climate-related financial risks in their\nown policies and procedures.\n4. Additional Requirements\nThe Recipient agrees to not subordinate EPA's interest in grant funds that have not yet been used for\nprogram purposes in a manner that waives EPA's claim for compensation under any applicable statutory\nclaims, 2 CFR Part 200, or common law. Once a Recipient uses grant funds for program purposes and\nincurs a financial obligation, as defined under 2 CFR 200.1, EPA will only seek claims on those funds in\nthe event that they were used for costs that do not comply with the terms and conditions of the Award\nAgreement or if there is adequate evidence of waste, fraud, or abuse, prompting adverse action by EPA\nper 2 CFR 200.339. This does not prohibit the use of subordinated debt as a form of Financial\nAssistance.\nThe Recipient agrees to provide Community Lender Subrecipients with training and technical assistance\non program-related matters, including on prudent financial risk management practices, in accordance\nwith 2 CFR 200.332(f).\nP. Historic Preservation\nNational Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)\nSection 106 of the NHPA requires all federal agencies to consider the effects of their undertakings,\nincluding the act of awarding a grant, on historic properties, and to provide the Advisory Council on\nHistoric Preservation (ACHP) a reasonable opportunity to comment on such undertakings. The Recipient\nmust assist the EPA Project Officer in complying with NHPA if any activities funded under this grant\nimpact a historic property. Historic properties can include: (a) land or buildings listed in or eligible for\nlisting on the National Register of Historic Places; (b) archaeologically sensitive areas or in an area\nwhere traditional cultural properties are located; and (c) properties that are associated with significant\nhistoric events, are associated with significant people, embody distinctive characteristics, and contain\nimportant precontact information.\nThe Recipient should work with their Project Officer to ensure that Subrecipients are available to work\nwith EPA on any required consultation process with the State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) or\nTribal Historic Preservation Office (THPO) prior to commencing the project to ensure compliance with\nSection 106 of the NHPA.\nIf NHPA compliance is required, necessary Section 106 consultation activities, such as historic or\narchitectural surveys, structural engineering analysis of buildings, public meetings, and archival\nComplaint Exhibit A at 40\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 88 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 41\nphotographs, can be considered allowable and allocable grant costs.\nArcheological and Historic Preservation Act (AHPA)\nThis law applies if archeologically significant artifacts or similar items are discovered after an EPA-funded\nconstruction project has begun, and compliance may be coordinated with the NHPA, discussed above.\nThe AHPA requires federal agencies to identify relics, specimens, and other forms of scientific,\nprehistorical, historical, or archaeologic data that may be lost during the construction of federally-\nsponsored projects to ensure that these resources are not inadvertently transferred, sold, demolished or\nsubstantially altered, or allowed to deteriorate significantly. The Recipient must ensure that Subrecipients\nperforming construction projects are aware of this requirement, and the Recipient must notify EPA if the\nAHPA is triggered.\nQ. Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act\nThe Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act (URA) applies to\nacquisitions of property and displacements of individuals and businesses that result from federally\nassisted programs. The URA and Federal Highway Administration's implementing regulations at 49 CFR\nPart 24 require the Recipient to follow certain procedures for acquiring property for purposes under the\nfederal award, such as notice, negotiation, and appraisal requirements. The statute and regulations also\ncontain requirements for carrying out relocations of displaced persons and businesses, such as\nreimbursement requirements for moving expenses and standards for replacement housing. The\nRecipient must comply with, and ensure Subrecipients comply with, the URA and 49 CFR Part 34 if an\nEPA-funded acquisition of property results in permanent displacement of individuals or businesses. Note\nthat although the URA does not apply to temporary displacement of residents, the cost for temporary\nrelocation of residents may be an allowable cost under the “necessary and reasonable for the\nperformance of the Federal award” provision of 2 CFR 200.403(a). The Recipient must obtain prior\napproval of the EPA Project Officer and EPA Award Official for the allowability of costs for temporary\nrelocation of residents.  \nR. Remedies for Non-Compliance\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement. Should the\nRecipient fail to adhere to the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement, the EPA may impose\nadditional conditions as set forth in 2 CFR 200.208. If the EPA determines that noncompliance cannot be\nremedied by imposing additional conditions, the EPA may seek remedies under 2 CFR 200.339 up to\nand including termination and the recovery of unallowable costs provided in 2 CFR 200.343. As specified\nin 2 CFR 200.343, which will remain in effect throughout the term of this award, costs during suspension\nor after termination are allowable if (a) the costs result from financial obligations which were properly\nincurred by the non-Federal entity before the effective date of suspension or termination, are not in\nanticipation of it, and (b) the costs would be allowable if the Federal award was not suspended or expired\nnormally at the end of the period of performance in which the termination takes effect.\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the statutory requirements of Section 134 of the Clean Air Act.\nShould the Recipient violate the statutory requirements of Section 134 by failing to use grant funds in\naccordance with Section 134 or by failing to ensure that the activities of Subrecipients are in accordance\nwith Section 134, EPA may seek remedies under Section 113, which may subject the Recipient to civil\nadministrative penalties through an EPA administrative enforcement action, civil penalties and/or\ninjunctive relief through a civil judicial enforcement action by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), or\nComplaint Exhibit A at 41\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 89 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 42\ncriminal penalties through a DOJ criminal judicial enforcement action.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Award Agreement, EPA will not determine that Recipient has\nfailed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement, without providing a reasonable\nopportunity to remedy under 2 CFR 200.208, for good faith efforts to comply with the Performance\nReporting National Programmatic Term and Condition, Additional Programmatic Terms and Conditions\nregarding Build America, Buy America or Labor and Equitable Workforce Development Requirements,\nrequirements for Subrecipient oversight, or to obligate or expend funds for allowable activities.\nS. Clarifications to EPA General Terms and Conditions\nEPA agrees to make the following clarifications to the EPA General Terms and Conditions. These\nclarifications expand on, rather than replace or modify, the EPA General Terms and Conditions. The\nRecipient agrees to comply with these clarifications.\n1. Indirect Cost Rate\nThe Recipient must exclude costs for Acquisitions of Intangible Property from any calculations of\nmodified total direct costs (MTDC), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1. Intangible Property is not a “service” and\ntherefore is not included in MTDC. The Recipient should note that Subrecipients that receive loans\ncannot charge an indirect cost rate against their loans and that entities that receive Participant Support\nCosts cannot charge an indirect cost rate against their Participant Support Cost payments.\nModified total direct costs (MTDC), as defined in 2 CFR 200.1, means all direct salaries and wages,\napplicable fringe benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first $50,000 of each\nSubaward (regardless of the period of performance of the Subawards under the award). MTDC excludes\nequipment, capital expenditures, charges for patient care, rental costs, tuition remission, scholarships\nand fellowships, Participant Support Costs and the portion of each Subaward in excess of $50,000.\nIn the event that the Recipient is compensating an affiliated entity for its direct and indirect costs related\nto use of employees, the Recipient must not charge its indirect cost rate against any of these costs.\nNotwithstanding the General Term and Condition “Indirect Cost Rate Agreements,” the Recipient may\nclaim up to a 15% de minimis rate of modified total direct costs authorized by 2 CFR 200.414(f).\n2. Sufficient Progress\nThe EPA Project Officer may assess whether the Recipient is making sufficient progress in implementing\nthe workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement within 90 calendar days of June 30, 2025 as well\nas within 90 calendar days of June 30 of each year thereafter during the Period of Performance.\n“Sufficient progress” shall be assessed based on a comparison of the Recipient's planned versus actual\nexpenditures as well as planned versus actual outputs/outcomes. As noted under the Financial Risk\nManagement Programmatic Term and Condition, the Recipient's financial health, as measured by the\nrequired Financial Health Metrics, are also an input in this process. This term and condition “flows down”\nto Subrecipients, with the Recipient required to assess whether each Subrecipient is making sufficient\nprogress in implementing the workplan under its Subaward Agreement; the Recipient may increase the\nfrequency and scope of the review of sufficient progress of Subrecipients, in accordance with 2 CFR\n200.332 Requirements for Pass-Through Entities.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 42\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 90 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 43\nIf the EPA Project Officer determines that the Recipient has not made sufficient progress in implementing\nits workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement, the Recipient, if directed to do so, must\nimplement a corrective action plan concurred on by the EPA Project Officer and approved by the Award\nOfficial or Grants Management Officer pursuant to 2 CFR 200.208.\nEPA will not find that the Recipient has failed to make sufficient progress in implementing its workplan in\neffect under this Assistance Agreement based on shifts between types of Financial Assistance and/or\nCCIA-Eligible Projects over the Period of Performance (or other shifts in portfolio allocation, such as by\nregion or market segment, over the Period of Performance). If EPA finds the Recipient has failed to\nachieve sufficient progress on deployment of Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects in general,\nor is achieving progress at a slower rate than projected under the workplan in effect under this\nAssistance Agreement, the Recipient will have an opportunity to implement a corrective action plan\npursuant to 2 CFR 200.208.\n3. Termination\nEPA maintains the right to terminate the Assistance Agreement only as specified in 2 CFR 200.339 and\nthe version of 2 CFR 200.340 effective as of October 1, 2024, when the noncompliance with the terms\nand conditions is substantial such that effective performance of the Assistance Agreement is Materially\nImpaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse, or material misrepresentation of\neligibility status,  prompting adverse action by EPA per 2 CFR 200.339, through either a partial or full\ntermination. If EPA partially or fully terminates the Assistance Agreement, EPA must (1) de-obligate\nuncommitted funds and re-obligate them to another Eligible Recipient selected under Funding\nOpportunity Number 66.960 (CCIA) to effectuate the objectives of Section 134 of the Clean Air Act, 42\nUSC § 7434 within 90 days of the de-obligation and (2) amend the Recipient's Assistance Agreement to\nreflect the reduced amount, based on the de-obligation. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.341, EPA will\nprovide the Recipient notice of termination. If an Eligible Recipient has assumed a legal obligation\nproperly incurred for an allowable activity entered into by a suspended or terminated Recipient, EPA will\nre-obligate funds to the Eligible Recipient to satisfy the legal obligation and accept an amended workplan\nand budget to that effect.\nT. Period of Performance\nThe Period of Performance under this Award Agreement will end on the date specified in the Notice of\nAward. However, the Period of Performance may end prior to the date specified in the Notice of Award if\nall required work of the Federal award has been completed, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.344. In\naccordance with 2 CFR 200.344(b), the Recipient agrees to liquidate all financial obligations incurred\nunder the award no later than 120 calendar days after the end date of the Period of Performance. In this\ncontext, to “liquidate all financial obligations” means to pay outstanding bills, such as the payment of staff\nsalaries accrued during the Period of Performance but for which the due date falls after the end date of\nthe Period of Performance. \nThe Recipient should note that the Recipient will not be considered to have met the requirements for\ncloseout under its award under 2 CFR 200.344 so long as any Subrecipient has not met the\nrequirements for closeout under its subaward under 2 CFR 200.344.\nNotwithstanding the Extension of Project/Budget Period Expiration Date General Term and Condition, in\naccordance with 2 CFR 200.308(g)(2), the Recipient is authorized to initiate a one-time extension of the\nPeriod of Performance by up to 12 months without prior EPA approval, provided that the extension\nComplaint Exhibit A at 43\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 91 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 44\ncomplies with the requirements 2 CFR 200.308(g)(2). In accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(g)(2), the\nRecipient must “notify the Federal agency in writing with the supporting justification and a revised period\nof performance at least 10 calendar days before the conclusion of the period of performance.” \nU. Closeout Agreement\nAs provided at 2 CFR 200.307(c) and 2 CFR 1500.8(d), after the end of the Period of Performance of the\nAssistance Agreement, the Recipient may keep and use Program Income remaining at the end of the\nAssistance Agreement and use Post-Closeout Program Income in accordance with this term and\ncondition. The Closeout Agreement goes into effect for this Assistance Agreement the earlier of 1) the\nday after the Assistance Agreement Period of Performance ends, 2) the first date when all required work\nof the Federal award has been completed in accordance with 2 CFR 200.344 and the Recipient has met\nthe requirements for closeout (including but not limited to submitting the final report as specified in the\nPerformance Reporting Programmatic Term and Condition) or 3) an alternative date that is mutually\nagreed by the Recipient and the EPA Grants Management Officer or Award Official.\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.344, EPA will proceed to closeout the Award Agreement and enter the\nCloseout Period even if the Recipient has not met the requirements for closeout (including but not limited\nto submitting the final report as specified in the Performance Reporting Programmatic Term and\nCondition). As provided in 2 CFR 200.344: “When the recipient or subrecipient fails to complete the\nnecessary administrative actions or the required work for an award, the Federal agency or pass-through\nentity must proceed with closeout based on the information available.” This Closeout Agreement is\ntherefore self-executing.\nThis term and condition is the entire Closeout Agreement between the EPA and the Recipient. If any\nprovisions of this Closeout Agreement are invalidated by a court of law, the parties shall remain bound to\ncomply with the provisions of this Closeout Agreement that have not been invalidated. The Closeout\nAgreement will be interpreted and, if necessary, enforced under Federal law and regulations. The\nRecipient shall comply with the requirements specified below as part of the Closeout Agreement.\nDefinitions within 2 CFR 200.1, including as supplemented through I. Definitions of this award\nagreement, apply identically to how they do under the Period of Performance, unless otherwise noted.\nAs specified in the Flow-Down Requirements Programmatic Term and Condition, the Closeout\nAgreement Programmatic Term and Condition flows down to Subrecipients such that the Recipient must\nenter into a corresponding Closeout Agreement with any Subrecipient that has Program Income or\nanticipates generating Post-Closeout Program Income at the end of the Subrecipient's Period of\nPerformance.\n1. Allowable Activities\nThe Recipient shall use Post-Closeout Program Income in accordance with the Allowable and\nUnallowable Activities Programmatic Term and Condition, as applicable.\n2. Reporting Requirements\nAfter the Closeout Agreement becomes effective, the Recipient shall disclose annual reports publicly, as\ndescribed in the Performance Reporting Programmatic Term and Condition, rather than meeting the\nreporting requirements described in the Performance Reporting Programmatic Term and Condition.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 44\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 92 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 45\n3. LIDAC Expenditure Requirements\nThe Recipient shall expend 100% of Post-Closeout Program Income for the purposes of providing\nFinancial Assistance in Low-Income and Disadvantaged Communities and comply with this requirement\nin accordance with the LIDAC Expenditure Requirement Programmatic Term and Condition, as\napplicable. Funds used for the purposes of providing Financial Assistance includes Capitalization\nFunding; Technical Assistance Subawards; Technical Assistance Services; and Program Administration\nActivities. This requirement applies to the entire award provided to the Recipient and “flows down” to\neach Subrecipient.\n4. Cash Management Requirements\nThe Recipient must maintain Post-Closeout Program Income in accordance with the Cash Management\nRequirements in the Financial Risk Management Requirements Programmatic Term and Condition, as\napplicable. However, the Recipient may submit a Cash Management Policy for review and approval by\nthe EPA Project Officer, which can authorize the Recipient to deviate from the aforementioned Cash\nManagement Requirements.\n5. Financial Health Metrics\nAfter the Closeout Agreement becomes effective, the Recipient agrees to report financial health metrics\nin accordance with the Financial Health Metrics in the Financial Risk Management Requirements\nProgrammatic Term and Condition (on behalf of the Recipient, Pass-Through Subrecipients, as well as\nCommunity Lender Subrecipients that have received in excess of $10,000,000 in Capitalization Funding)\npublicly, rather than disclosing the metrics to EPA, as applicable. The requirement for submission of\nfinancial health metrics is not applicable for any fiscal year in which the reporting entity did not meet the\nrequirements of 2 CFR Subpart F—Audit Requirements. The Recipient agrees to add the following two\nfinancial health metrics as part of the financial health metrics for the Closeout Period:\n1. Self-Sufficiency Ratio: The self-sufficiency ratio is defined as earned revenue divided by operating\nexpenses, where earned revenue is equal to the value of all income earned from normal business\ntransactions and operating expenses is equal to the value of all expenses incurred as a part of normal\nbusiness operations over the prior 12-month period, not including interest, financing, depreciation,\namortization, and loan loss provision expense.\n2. Operating Cash Ratio: The operating cash ratio is defined as cash and cash equivalents divided by\noperating expenses, where cash and cash equivalents is equal to the total value of all cash and cash\nequivalent items that can be converted into cash immediately and operating expenses is equal to the\nvalue of all expenses incurred as a part of normal business operations over the prior 12-month period,\nnot including interest, financing, depreciation, amortization, and loan loss provision expense.\n6. Conflicts of Interest\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the conflict of interest requirements described in the Conflicts of\nInterest Programmatic Term and Condition through September 30, 2031.\n7. Remedies for Non-Compliance\nThe Recipient agrees to identical remedies for non-compliance that are specified in the Remedies for\nComplaint Exhibit A at 45\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 93 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 46\nNon-Compliance Programmatic Term and Condition, as applicable. During the Closeout Period, the\nworkplan and budget submitted for the Period of Performance are no longer applicable.\n8. Suspension and Debarment\nThe Recipient agrees to ensure that Post-Closeout Program Income is not transferred to entities that are\ncurrently suspended, debarred, or otherwise declared ineligible under 2 CFR Part 180. The Recipient\ncan maintain compliance with this requirement through either (1) checking the System for Award\nManagement (for Subrecipients, Contractors, or Program Beneficiaries) or (2) obtaining eligibility\ncertifications from counterparties (for Program Beneficiaries). The Recipient may access the System for\nAward Management (SAM) exclusion list at https://sam.gov/SAM to determine whether an entity is\npresently excluded or disqualified.\n9. Non-Discrimination\nThe Recipient must use Post-Closeout Program Income in compliance with EPA regulations at 40 CFR\nPart 7 regarding non-discrimination in EPA-funded programs, as applicable.\nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, The Age\nDiscrimination Act of 1975. The Recipient agrees to comply with these laws, prohibiting discrimination in\nthe provision of services or benefits, on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability or age, in\nprograms or activities receiving federal financial assistance. \nPursuant to EPA's regulations on “Nondiscrimination in Programs receiving Federal Assistance from the\nEnvironmental Protection Agency” in 40 CFR Part 5 and 40 CFR Part 7, the Recipient agrees, and will\nrequire all Subrecipients to agree, not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex,\ndisability or age.\nExecutive Order 11246 Part III of Executive Order No. 11246 (September 24, 1965) as amended\nprohibits discrimination in Federally assisted construction activities. As provided in section 301 of the\nExecutive Order, the Recipient will ensure that Subrecipients include the seven clauses specified in\nsection 202 of the Order in all construction contracts. Section 302 defines \"Construction contract\" as “any\ncontract for the construction, rehabilitation, alteration, conversion, extension, or repair of buildings,\nhighways, or other improvements to Real Property.” Contracts less than $10,000 are exempt from the\nrequirements of the Order.\n10. Record-Keeping\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.334(e), the Recipient shall maintain appropriate records to document\ncompliance with the requirements of the Closeout Agreement (i.e., records relating to the use of Post-\nCloseout Program Income) for a three-year period following the end of the Closeout Agreement, unless\none of the conditions specified in the regulation applies. Note that this requirement applies if and when\nthe Closeout Agreement is terminated, in accordance with Item 14. Termination of the Closeout\nAgreement. EPA may obtain access to these records to verify that Post-Closeout Program Income has\nbeen used in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Closeout Agreement. Records and\ndocuments relating solely to performing the grant agreement prior to closeout may be disposed of in\naccordance with 2 CFR 200.334.\nAdditionally, the Recipient must maintain adequate accounting records for how Post-Closeout Program\nComplaint Exhibit A at 46\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 94 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 47\nIncome is managed and spent as well as all other appropriate records and documents related to the\nactivities conducted using Program Income.\nThe Recipient agrees to ensure that Subrecipients comply with Federal Funding Accountability and\nTransparency Act (FFATA) reporting requirements. The Recipient may use the terms of its Subaward\nAgreements or other effective means to meet its responsibilities.\n11. Other Federal Requirements\nThe following other federal requirements apply to the use of Post-Closeout Program Income under the\nCloseout Period to the same extent they do under the terms of the Performance Period:\nDavis-Bacon and Related Acts, as specified in the Labor and Equitable Workforce Development\nRequirements Programmatic Term and Condition;\nBuild America, Buy America Act, as specified in the Build America, Buy America Act\nProgrammatic Term and Condition; and\nNational Historic Preservation Act, as specified in the Historic Preservation Programmatic Term\nand Condition.\nNo other federal requirements apply to the use of Post-Closeout Program Income under the terms of this\nCloseout Agreement, other than those specified in this Closeout Agreement.\n12. Audit Requirements\nThe Recipient agrees to meet the requirements of 2 CFR Subpart F—Audit Requirements during the\nCloseout Period, as activities related to the Federal award referenced in 2 CFR 200.502(a) include\nactivities during the Closeout Period.\nThrough September 30, 2031, the Recipient agrees to notify the EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar\ndays of the submission of the Recipient's Single Audit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse's Internet Data\nEntry System. This requirement “flows-down” to each Subrecipient in that the Recipient must also notify\nthe EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar days of the Subrecipient's Single Audit to the Federal Audit\nClearinghouse's Internet Data Entry System.\n13. Amendments to the Closeout Agreement\nThe EPA Award Official or Grants Management Officer and the Recipient must agree to any\nmodifications to the terms and conditions of this Closeout Agreement. Agreed-upon modifications must\nbe in writing. Oral or unilateral modifications shall not be effective or binding.\n14. Termination of the Closeout Agreement\nThe Closeout Agreement terminates when either of the following situations occur: (1) the Recipient holds\na de minimis amount of Post-Closeout Program Income and does not anticipate generating more than a\nde minimis amount of additional Post-Closeout Program Income or (2) the Recipient and the EPA Award\nOfficial or Grants Management Officer mutually agree to terminate the Closeout Agreement, with the\nRecipient remitting current and future Post-Closeout Program Income to the federal government.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 47\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 95 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 48\nThe ability to terminate the Closeout Agreement flows down to Subrecipients, as a Closeout Agreement\nbetween the Recipient and Subrecipient terminates when either (1) the Subrecipient holds a de minimis\namount of Post-Closeout Program Income and does not anticipate generating more than a de minimis\namount of additional Post-Closeout Program Income or (2) the Subrecipient and the Recipient mutually\nagree to terminate the Closeout Agreement, with the Subrecipient remitting current and future Post-\nCloseout Program Income to the Recipient.\nThe de minimis amount must be agreed-upon in writing by the Recipient and the Director of the Office of\nthe Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (or equivalent), prior to the Recipient using the “de minimis” criteria\nto terminate the Closeout Agreement.\n15. Points of Contact\nThe points of contact for the Closeout Agreement are the EPA Project Officer (for the EPA) and the\nAuthorized Representative on the EPA Key Contacts Form most recently submitted to the EPA Project\nOfficer (for the Recipient). If changes are made to these points of contact, the respective party must\nnotify the other within 30 calendar days of the planned change.\nV. Legal Counsel\nThe Recipient agrees to appoint appropriate legal counsel if counsel is not already available.\nW. Accounting Principles\nThe Recipient must account for award funds in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (GAAP) as in effect in the United States.\nThe Recipient must segregate and account for the award funds separately from all other program and\nbusiness accounts. Additionally, the Recipient must segregate and account for Program Income\nseparately from all other program and business accounts.\nX. Internal Controls\nThe Recipient must comply with standards for internal controls described at 2 CFR 200.303. The\n“Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government” issued by the Comptroller General of the\nUnited States referenced in § 200.303 are available online at: https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-14-704g.\npdf.\nY. Audits\nThe Recipient agrees to meet the requirements of 2 CFR Subpart F—Audit Requirements during the\nPeriod of Performance, as described in the Audit Requirements General Term and Condition.\nAdditionally, in accordance with 2 CFR 200.332 and 2 CFR 200.501(i), the Recipient agrees to disclose\ndirectly to the EPA Project Officer audited financial statements from any for-profit Subrecipient that\nexpends $1,000,000 or more of EPA funds from the Recipient's grant program in the Subrecipient's fiscal\nyear. Any for-profit Subrecipient that must disclose such financial statements is required to select an\nindependent auditor consistent with the criteria set forth in 2 CFR 200.509 and obtain an independent\naudit substantially similar in scope and quality to that of the Single Audit (see 2 CFR 200.500 et. seq.).\nThe Subrecipient must submit the audit to the Recipient within 9 months of the end of the Recipient's\nComplaint Exhibit A at 48\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 96 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 49\nfiscal year or 30 days after receiving the report from an independent auditor, whichever is earlier.\nThe Recipient agrees to notify the EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar days of the submission of the\nRecipient's Single Audit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse's Internet Data Entry System. This\nrequirement “flows-down” to each Subrecipient in that the Recipient must also notify the EPA Project\nOfficer within 30 calendar days of the Subrecipient's Single Audit to the Federal Audit Clearinghouse's\nInternet Data Entry System.\nZ. EPA Project Officer Oversight and Monitoring\nPursuant to 2 CFR 200.206(b) and (c), 2 CFR 200.208(b)(1), and 2 CFR 200.208(c)(3)(4) and (6), EPA\nhas determined that specific conditions are necessary to ensure that the Clean Communities Investment\nAccelerator Fund program is effectively carried out by Eligible Recipients that have not previously\nmanaged grants with the same scale and complexity of this agreement. These specific conditions will\nremain in effect throughout the Period of Performance unless the EPA Award Official determines, based\non a request by the Recipient or EPA Project Officer, that some or all of the specific conditions are no\nlonger necessary for EPA to manage programmatic or financial risks.\nThe EPA Project Officer, or other EPA staff designated by the EPA Project Officer or the Division\nDirector of the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator program, will oversee and monitor the grant\nagreement through activities, if determined necessary, including:\n1. Upon request, requiring the Recipient to participate in an annual workshop (i.e., one workshop\nper calendar year) with other Recipients under the National Clean Investment Fund and/or Clean\nCommunities Investment Accelerator; the EPA Project Officer will contact the Recipient to finalize\ndetails for each annual workshop.\n2. Participation in project activities, to the extent permissible under EPA policies, such as:\nconsultation on effective methods of carrying out the workplan in effect under this Assistance\nAgreement, provided the Recipient makes the final decision on how to perform authorized\nactivities; coordination by EPA staff with other Recipients under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction\nFund with other EPA programs; and coordination by EPA staff with other federal programs to\navoid duplication of effort;\n3. Closely monitoring the Recipient's management and oversight of Subrecipients and\nprocedures for ensuring that program beneficiaries adhere to program participation guidelines;\n4. Closely monitoring the Recipient's performance to verify compliance with the workplan in effect\nunder this Assistance Agreement and achievement of environmental results;\n5. Participating in periodic telephone conference calls with Recipient personnel to discuss project\nsuccesses and challenges as well as similar items impacting program performance;\n6. Reviewing and commenting on performance reports prepared under the Award Agreement.\nNote that the final decision on the content of performance reports rests with the Recipient;\n7. Verifying that the Recipient is expending the award on allowable activities, including but not\nlimited to reviewing a sample of Capitalization Funding and Technical Assistance Subawards to\nverify compliance with regulatory requirements and the terms and conditions of the Award\nComplaint Exhibit A at 49\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 97 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 50\nAgreement; and\n8. Periodically reviewing costs incurred by the Recipient as well as its contractors and\nSubrecipients if needed to ensure appropriate expenditure of grant funds. Note that Recipients\nare not required to submit documentation of costs incurred before obtaining payments of grant\nfunds.\nSubject to approval by the EPA Award Official, the EPA Project Officer and the Recipient may mutually\nagree to additional areas of oversight and monitoring.\nMethod for Reconsideration. If the Recipient believes that one or more of these specific conditions are\nnot warranted or requires modification, the Recipient must file a written objection naming the specific\ncondition(s) within 21 calendar days of the EPA award or amendment mailing date and must not draw\ndown funds until the objection is resolved. The Recipient must submit the written objection via email to\nthe Award Official, Grant Specialist, and Project Officer identified in the Notice of Award.\nAA. Compliant URL Links\nThe EPA may elect to develop informational materials to publicize the key characteristics of the\nRecipient's GGRF award. These materials may include links to Recipient and/or Subrecipients' websites.\nThe Recipient agrees to work with the EPA Project Officer or another member of GGRF program staff to\nensure any such links are compliant with pertinent EPA and government-wide standards.\nAB. Conflicts of Interest\nThe Recipient must comply with requirements on transfers of funds that create actual and potential\nconflicts of interest, as specified in this term and condition. Transfers of funds include Subawards,\nContracts (including but not limited to Acquisitions of Intangible Property), and Participant Support Costs.\nThe definitions in the EPA's Financial Assistance Conflict of Interest Policy (COI Policy) apply to this term\nand condition.\nThere are three categories of transfers of funds, with the requirements differing by each category (as\nspecified in this term and condition):\n1. Transfers with Affiliated Entities: Subawards, Contracts, and Participant Support Costs to Affiliated\nEntities or co-invested in projects with Affiliated Entities. An Affiliated Entity is any entity that is related to\nthe Recipient in accordance with the indicia of control described in 2 CFR 180.905.\n2. Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects: Subawards, Contracts (in the form of Acquisitions of\nIntangible Property), and Participant Support Costs as forms of Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible\nProjects, unless such transfers are with Affiliated Entities. These transfers are not within the scope of the\nCOI Policy, which states that “subawards in the form of loans, loan guarantees, interest subsidies and\nprincipal forgiveness, purchases of insurance or similar transactions entered into with borrowers by\nrecipients of revolving loan fund capitalization grants or other EPA financial assistance agreements\nwhere Agency funds may be used for lending activities.”\n3. Subgrants and Contracts: Subgrants and Contracts (other than Acquisitions of Intangible Property),\nunless such transfers are with Affiliated Entities.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 50\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 98 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 51\nNote that all Contracts (including Acquisitions of Intangible Property) must also comply with the conflict of\ninterest standards in 2 CFR 200.318(c).\n1. Transfers with Affiliated Entities\nPrior Approval of COI Mitigation Plan\nThe Recipient must not transfer funds with Affiliated Entities unless those transfers have been included in\nan EPA-approved COI Mitigation Plan on Transfers of Funds with Affiliated Entities. The Recipient\nagrees to seek prior EPA approval for changes to the COI Mitigation Plan on Transfers of Funds with\nAffiliated Entities.\nQuarterly Disclosure Requirement\nThe Recipient agrees to disclose, on a quarterly basis, a list of newly originated transfers of funds with\nAffiliated Entities that are within the scope of its EPA-approved COI Mitigation Plan on Transfers of\nFunds with Affiliated Entities. Each quarterly disclosure must include (1) a list of such transfers of funds\nmade over the quarter and (2) steps taken to taken to eliminate, neutralize or mitigate any conflicts of\ninterest, in accordance with the EPA-approved COI Mitigation Plan on Transfers of Funds with Affiliated\nEntities. The Recipient must disclose its own transfers as well as transfers made by Subrecipients.\nThe quarterly periods for such disclosures are defined as follows: April 1 to June 30; July 1 to September\n30; October 1 to December 31; and January 1 to March 31. The Recipient must make the disclosures to\nthe EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar days of the end of the quarterly period.\nProject Officer Review\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.337, the EPA Project Officer may access records relating to a subset of\ntransactions disclosed to review for compliance with the Recipient's EPA-approved COI Mitigation Plan\non Transfers of Funds with Affiliated Entities as well as this term and condition. The EPA Project Officer\nwill not approve transfers of funds in advance but rather will review transfers of funds that have already\noccurred for compliance.\nWaivers and Modifications\nEPA agrees that, for transfers of funds with Affiliated Entities, the requirements of this term and condition\napply in lieu of the requirements of the Disclosing Conflict of Interest General Term and Condition.\nOn a case-by-cases basis, the EPA Project Officer may extend the due date for disclosures on transfers\nof funds with Affiliated Entities. On a case-by-case basis, the EPA Project Officer may waive or modify\nthe disclosure requirements on transfers of funds with Affiliated Entities.\n2. Financial Assistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects\nSemi-Annual Disclosure Requirement\nThe Recipient agrees to disclose, on a semi-annual basis, a list of transfers of funds as Financial\nAssistance to CCIA-Eligible Projects with actual and potential conflicts of interest. Each semi-annual\ndisclosure must include (1) a list of such transfers of funds made over the semi-annual period and (2)\nComplaint Exhibit A at 51\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 99 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 52\nsteps taken to taken to eliminate, neutralize or mitigate any conflicts of interest, in accordance with any\nEPA-approved documents related to eliminating, neutralizing, and mitigating conflicts of interest. The\nRecipient must disclose transfers made by Subrecipients.\nThe semi-annual periods for such disclosures are defined as follows: July 1 to December 31; January 1\nto June 30. The Recipient must make the disclosures to the EPA Project Officer within 30 calendar days\nof the end of the semi-annual period.\nB. Project Officer Review\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 200.337, the EPA Project Officer may access records relating to a subset of\ntransactions disclosed to review for compliance with the Recipient's EPA-approved documents related to\neliminating, neutralizing, and mitigating conflicts of interest as well as this term and condition. The EPA\nProject Officer will not approve transfers of funds in advance but rather will review transfers of funds that\nhave already occurred for compliance.\nC. Waivers and Modifications\nOn a case-by-cases basis, the EPA Project Officer may extend the due date for disclosures on transfers\nof funds as Financial Assistance to Qualified Projects. On a case-by-case basis, the EPA Project Officer\nmay waive or modify the disclosure requirements on transfers of funds as Financial Assistance to\nQualified Projects.\n3. Subgrants and Contracts\nThe Recipient agrees to comply with the Disclosing Conflict of Interest General Term and Condition for\nSubgrants and Contracts (excluding Acquisitions of Intangible Property), unless such transfers are with\nAffiliated Entities. If such transfers are with Affiliated Entities, then the Recipient is required to include\nthem in the process specified in 1. Transfers with Affiliated Entities.\nAC. Prior Approvals\nEPA will only have authority to review and approve revisions to the Recipient's workplan in effect under\nthis Assistance Agreement, budget, and other documents if authorized by 2 CFR 200.308 or 2 CFR\n200.208. The Recipient must contact the EPA Project Officer when the EPA has prior approval authority\nspecified below. Denial of a request for prior approval will be provided in writing, with an explanation of\nthe rationale.\nWorkplan\nFor the purposes of this Award Agreement, EPA interprets 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1) to enable the Recipient\nto revise the activities specified in its workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement without prior\nEPA approval, provided the activities still comply with the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement.\nThe allowable and allocable grant costs are narrowly defined, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the\nAward Agreement; in accordance with 2 CFR 200.308(c)(1), any changes to the workplan in effect under\nthis Assistance Agreement that comply with the statute as well as the terms and conditions would not be\na “change in the scope or objective of the project or program.” Therefore, so long as the Recipient is\nupdating its workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement with the revised activities in accordance\nwith the terms and conditions of the Award Agreement, EPA will not require prior approval.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 52\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 100 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 53\nBudget\nFor the purposes of this Award Agreement, EPA implements 2 CFR 200.308(i)(2) in accordance with\nItem 1 of the Transfer of Funds General Term and Condition to enable the Recipient to revise the EPA-\napproved budget included in its Award Agreement without prior EPA approval, provided the cumulative\nfunding transfers among Object Class Categories (Personnel, Fringe Benefits, Travel, Equipment,\nSupplies, Contractual, Construction, Other, Indirect) do not exceed 10% of the total budget approved at\ntime of award. Therefore, so long as the Recipient is updating its EPA-approved budget by transferring\nfunds by less than or equal to these amounts, EPA will not require prior approval.\nHowever, notwithstanding the requirements of 2 CFR 200.308(i)(2), if the Recipient seeks to transfer any\namount of funds budgeted for Participant Support Costs to other budget categories, then it must seek\nprior approval pursuant to 2 CFR 200.308(f)(5).\nTransfers of Funds\n2 CFR 200.308(f)(6) requires the Recipient to obtain prior agency approval for “Subaward activities not\nproposed in the application and approved in the Federal award.” If the types of activities are described in\nthe workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement (including types of transfers to be conducted\nthrough Subawards, Participant Support Costs, Acquisitions of Intangible Property, and other Contracts\nas defined in 2 CFR 200.1), then EPA has provided the necessary prior agency approval for the\npurposes of 2 CFR 200.308(f)(6). Approval for the purposes of this regulation does not mean that such\ntransfers of funds are compliant with the statutes, regulations, and terms and conditions.\nChanges in Key Personnel\n2 CFR 200.308(f)(2) requires the Recipient to obtain prior agency approval for a “[c]hange in key\npersonnel (including employees and contractors) that are identified by name or position in the Federal\nAward.” If the Recipient is seeking to add or replace a “key person,” as defined by members of the board\nof directors and Senior Management whose roles are specified in the most recently submitted\nOrganizational Plan, then the Recipient must obtain prior EPA approval of the qualifications of the key\nperson.\nThe Recipient must request prior agency approval for an addition or replacement of a  “key person” via\nemail through the EPA Project Officer, who will have 8 calendar days to communicate EPA's disapproval\nof their qualifications via email, along with an accompanying justification. If 8 calendar days have passed\nwithout notification of EPA disapproval of the key person's qualifications pursuant to 2 CFR 200.308(c)\n(2), the Recipient is authorized to change the “key person.” Once the change is effective, the Recipient\nmust submit an updated Organizational Plan to the EPA Project Officer.\nAD. Flow-Down Requirements\nAs described in 2 CFR 200.101(b)(1), the terms and conditions of Federal awards flow down to\nSubawards unless a particular section of 2 CFR 200.101 or the terms and conditions of the Federal\naward specifically indicate otherwise. As required by 2 CFR 200.332(b), the Recipient agrees to ensure\nthat Subrecipients are aware of the requirements that apply to the Subrecipient.\nFor the purposes of this Award Agreement, all terms and conditions must flow down to Subawards to the\nextent they are applicable. The EPA Project Officer is authorized to waive the applicability of\nComplaint Exhibit A at 53\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 101 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 54\nprogrammatic terms and conditions to Subawards, unless the term and condition implements statutory,\nregulatory, or executive order requirements.\nAE. Resolution of Disputes Termination Provision\nThe Recipient is precluded from drawing down more than 78.46% of the Total Approved Assistance\nAmount until this condition is removed, which will occur when: a) the EPA Award Official, at the direction\nof the Grants Competition Disputes Decision Official (GCDDO), provides written confirmation that all\nadministrative disputes under the National Clean Investment Fund and the Clean Communities\nInvestment Accelerator are resolved in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures in Appendix A\nof the EPA Order 5700: Policy for Competition of Assistance Agreements; or b) the administrative\ndisputes are withdrawn, abandoned or dismissed; or c) December 31, 2024, whichever is sooner.\nIf EPA does need to alter the Selection Official's selection and partial funding decisions for this\nagreement based on a GCDDO determination the EPA Award Official will partially terminate this\nassistance agreement, de-obligate a portion of the funds that have been obligated and use the de-\nobligated funds to satisfy the terms of a GCDDO remedy benefiting another entity. The Recipient will\nthen provide an updated workplan and budget information, as needed, to amend the agreement.\nFor the purposes of this term and condition, EPA's partial termination may apply not just to obligated\nfunds that have not been drawn down from ASAP but also to Program Income that has been generated\nand retained by the Recipient under 2 CFR 1500.8(d) and the Program Income Programmatic Term and\nCondition of this agreement. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.307(e)(1), EPA may require that the amount\nof funds committed by EPA to the Recipient be reduced by all or some of the Program Income that has\nbeen generated by the Recipient.\nAF. Deposit Account at Financial Agent\nA depository institution has been designated as a financial agent of the United States (the Financial\nAgent) for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. The Recipient is required to set up and utilize an\nAccount or Accounts at the Financial Agent in accordance with the Financial Agent Terms and\nConditions (Section V) included in this Assistance Agreement.\nAG. Interim SF-425 Requirement\nThe Recipient must submit an SF-425 within 30 calendar days of receiving access to an Account or\nAccounts at the Financial Agent, with the SF-425 covering all activities supported by funds drawn from\nASAP and disbursed for actual and allowable costs, other than funds disbursed into the Account or\nAccounts at the Financial Agent.\nAH. Amendments to Terms and Conditions\nThe EPA Award Official or Grants Management Officer and the Recipient must agree to any\nmodifications to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement. Agreed-upon modifications must be\nin writing. Oral or unilateral modifications shall not be effective or binding.\nAI. Preservation of Guidance and Data\nAny statutes, regulations, agency documents, policies, and guidance (including FAQs and EPA's\nComplaint Exhibit A at 54\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 102 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 55\nImplementation Framework for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund), or executive orders referenced\nherein are incorporated by reference into the Award Agreement as of the effective date of this amended\nAward Agreement. These incorporated documents will be controlling on Recipient and Subrecipients in\nthe event such documents are deleted, repealed, rescinded, or replaced unless a statute provides\notherwise. This includes, but is not limited to, the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles\nand Audit Requirements for Federal Awards; Title 2 CFR Part 200 effective October 1, 2024, and the\nEPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024.\nThis provision cannot be changed without the consent of the Recipient.\nIV. ADMINISTRATIVE TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nPlease refer to Page 4, \"Administrative Conditions.\"\nV. FINANCIAL AGENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS\nA. Revisions to Award Agreement to Account for Financial Agent Arrangement\nBecause a depository institution has been designated as a financial agent of the United States (the\nFinancial Agent) for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the following revisions to the Award\nAgreement are effective without further action or notice required by the Recipient or EPA.\n1. Revisions to Section I. Definitions\nThe following new definition will be added to the Award Agreement:\nCapitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution: Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution\nmeans award funds that (1) the Recipient draws down from the Automated Standard Application\nPayments (ASAP) system and (2) disburses into the ‘Budget Account' as defined under the Deposit\nAccount at Financial Agent Programmatic Term and Condition to capitalize itself for subsequent use for\nany of the following Allowable Activities: Capitalization Funding; Technical Assistance Subawards;\nTechnical Assistance Services; and Program Administration Activities. Under this two-step transaction,\nwhich involves both a drawdown and disbursement, the Recipient's drawdown from ASAP is deemed (a)\nan advance payment of Federal funds in accordance with 2 CFR 200.305(b)(1); while the disbursement\ninto the Deposit Account at Financial Agent is deemed (b) an allowable cost to be charged to the EPA\naward, and (c) a “nonexchange transaction”, consistent with the definition of this term in the Statement of\nFederal Financial Accounting Standards No. 5. The full amount of the Capitalization by Nonexchange\nCapital Contribution must be recognized, reported, and accounted for as Program Income in accordance\nwith the Program Income Programmatic Term and Condition once clauses (a) and (b) are fulfilled. Any\nSubrecipient with a Deposit Account at Financial Agent will be entitled to receive its payments from\nRecipient as a Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution.\nThe definition of Program Income under the Award Agreement will be amended and replaced with:\nProgram Income: 2 CFR 200.1 defines Program Income as “gross income earned by the non-Federal\nentity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during\nComplaint Exhibit A at 55\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 103 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 56\nthe period of performance except as provided in § 200.307(f).” 2 CFR 200.1 notes that Program Income\n“includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or\npersonal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a\nFederal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans\nmade with Federal award funds.” For this program, there are two types of Program Income: (1) “Program\nIncome from Operations” and (2) “Program Income from Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital\nContribution”.\nProgram Income from Operations includes but is not limited to income from origination fees, servicing\nfees, and asset management fees; dividends from equity investments; revenue from asset sales; release\nof grant funds previously used as Financial Assistance (such as through loan guarantees, loan loss\nreserves, or similar transactions); interest and other earnings on disbursements of grant funds that have\nnot been transferred to third parties; and funds raised with costs charged against the grant award (such\nas private debt, philanthropic contributions, and other funds raised). Under this award agreement, the\nRecipient is authorized to deduct the cost of generating Program Income from Operations under 2 CFR\n200.307(b) and 2 CFR 1500.8(b), provided the costs are reasonable and necessary for performance\nunder the federal award and the costs are not charged to the EPA award. Costs incidental to the\ngeneration of Program Income from Operations include origination, servicing, and management costs\nthat are not charged as direct costs to the Federal award. Costs of generating Program Income from\nOperations can be incurred in advance of receiving the gross income, with the Recipient incurring the\ncosts and later using gross income to reimburse itself for no more than the actual costs incurred to\ngenerate the Program Income from Operations, provided the Recipient can account for the actual costs\nincurred. Program Income from Operations requirements flow down to Subrecipients but not to\nContractors or Program Beneficiaries. Program Income from Operations can be earned prior to the\navailability of the ‘Program Income from Operations' account as defined under the Deposit Account at\nFinancial Agent Programmatic Term and Condition.\nProgram Income from Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution means award funds from the\nASAP system that the Recipient draws down and immediately deposits into the ‘Budget Account' at the\nFinancial Agent in accordance with (a) the definition of Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital\nContribution and (b) the Deposit Account at Financial Agent Programmatic Term and Condition. Program\nIncome from Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution cannot be earned prior to the\navailability of the ‘Budget Account' as defined under the Deposit Account at Financial Agent\nProgrammatic Term and Condition.\nBoth forms of Program Income under this program must be treated in accordance with the Program\nIncome Programmatic Term and Condition. EPA-specific rules on Program Income are provided at 2\nCFR 1500.8, and rules on allowable fund raising costs are provided under 2 CFR 200.442 (with\nadditional details in Item 4 of the EPA Guidance on Selected Items of Cost for Recipients). Program\nIncome requirements flow down to Subrecipients but not to Contractors or Program Beneficiaries.\n2. Revisions to Section II. National Programmatic Terms and Conditions\nThe Program Income Programmatic Term and Condition will be amended and replaced with:\nProgram Income\nIn accordance with Clean Air Act Section 134(b)(1)(C) as well as 2 CFR 200.307(e)(2) and 2 CFR 1500.8\n(b), the Recipient must retain Program Income earned during the Period of Performance. Program\nComplaint Exhibit A at 56\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 104 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 57\nIncome will be added to funds committed to the program by EPA and used for the purposes and under\nthe conditions of the Assistance Agreement and beyond the Period of Performance based on a Closeout\nAgreement.\nIn any period of time before such a Closeout Agreement is effective but after the Recipient has fully used\nthe award for allowable activities, the Recipient is authorized to use Program Income under the terms\nand conditions of the Assistance Agreement, as opposed to the terms and conditions outlined under the\nCloseout Agreement Programmatic Term and Condition. The terms and conditions outlined under the\nCloseout Agreement Programmatic Term and Condition will supplant the terms and conditions of the\nAssistance Agreement once the Closeout Agreement becomes effective.\nIn accordance with 2 CFR 1500.8(d) as supplemented by the Period of Performance Programmatic Term\nand Condition, under ordinary circumstances, the Recipient may only use Program Income from\nOperations once the initial award funds are fully used for allowable activities or the Period of\nPerformance ends for a different reason. However, Program Income from Operations may be used by\nthe Recipient in advance of the initial award funds (i.e. Program Income from Capitalization by\nNonexchange Capital Contribution) being fully used where reasonable and necessary to execute the\nactivities in the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement.\n3. Revisions to Section III. Additional Programmatic Terms and Conditions\nThe Allowable and Unallowable Activities Programmatic Term and Condition will be amended and\nreplaced with:\nAllowable and Unallowable Activities\nThe Recipient agrees to only use the award to support the following allowable activities: Capitalization by\nNonexchange Capital Contribution; Capitalization Funding; Technical Assistance Subawards; Technical\nAssistance Services; and Program Administration Activities. The Recipient must use awards funds\nexclusively for allowable activities within the ten EPA regions, with the exception of the Freely Associated\nStates. All costs charged to the award to support these activities must meet the requirements for\nallowability under 2 CFR Part 200, Subpart E as well as applicable provisions of 2 CFR Part 1500.\nCapitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution generates Program Income for the Recipient in an\namount equal to the available EPA award balance drawn down from ASAP into the ‘Budget Account' as\ndefined under the Deposit Account at Financial Agent Programmatic Term and Condition. Program\nIncome from Capitalization by Nonexchange Capital Contribution must be expended on Capitalization\nFunding, Technical Assistance Subawards, Technical Assistance Services, and Program Administration\nActivities in accordance with the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement. The allowability of\nlegal costs incurred in connection with the award shall be governed by applicable provisions of 2 CFR\nPart 200, Subpart E, including but not limited to 2 CFR 200.403, 2 CFR 200.435, 2 CFR 200.441 and 2\nCFR 200.459.\nThe Recipient agrees to not use the award for the following unallowable activities: (a) activities that\nsupport deployment of projects that do not meet the definition of CCIA-Eligible Projects; and (b) activities\nthat support deployment of projects outside the boundaries of the ten EPA regions.  \nThe Deposit Account at Financial Agent Programmatic Term and Condition will be amended and\nreplaced with:\nComplaint Exhibit A at 57\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 105 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 58\nDeposit Account at Financial Agent\nThe Recipient will open a Deposit Account at a depository institution that has been designated as a\nfinancial agent of the United States (the Financial Agent). Such account will be used as Recipient's\noperating account for the award. Upon establishment of the Deposit Account, the Recipient will\ndrawdown the entire available EPA award balance from ASAP and disburse it into the Deposit Account,\nwhere it must be maintained until the Closeout Agreement goes into effect in accordance with the\nCloseout Agreement Programmatic Term and Condition. Note, this requirement applies to any and all\ndrawdowns from ASAP by the Recipient while the Deposit Account is available and accessible. Once the\nCloseout Agreement goes into effect, the Recipient will be entitled to transfer any remaining funds in the\nDeposit Account to an account at a financial institution of its choosing, provided such account is insured\nin accordance with 2 CFR 200.305(b)(10)).\nThe Recipient will grant EPA a perfected security interest in all funds held in the Deposit Account. The\nRecipient will take all such actions, enter into all such agreements, and execute and deliver all such\ndocumentation as may be necessary and/or as directed by EPA from time to time to establish and\nmaintain such security interest, including but not necessarily limited to entering into an account control\nagreement (ACA) with the Financial Agent and EPA.\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Assistance Agreement, EPA will only furnish the Financial\nAgent with a Notice of Exclusive Control under an ACA when EPA issues a written determination and\nfinding that the Recipient has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of this Assistance\nAgreement, and that noncompliance is substantial such that effective performance of the Assistance\nAgreement is Materially Impaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse or material\nmisrepresentation of eligibility status, and that EPA has initiated action under 2 CFR 200.339 to wholly or\npartly suspend or terminate the Federal award, as authorized in the terms of the Assistance Agreement.\nThe written determination and finding and a copy of the Notice of Exclusive Control shall be sent to the\nRecipient when the Notice of Exclusive Control is furnished to the Financial Agent. EPA and Recipient\nhave mutually agreed only to the specific process outlined in this term for furnishing a Notice of Exclusive\nControl instruction to the Financial Agent.\nNote, funds in the Deposit Account that were legally obligated by the Recipient for financial obligations,\nas defined under 2 CFR 200.1, prior to the issuance of, but not in anticipation of, a Notice of Exclusive\nControl constitute “financial obligations which were properly incurred” by the Recipient in accordance\nwith 2 CFR 200.343 and are to remain allowable costs during suspension or after termination of the\nRecipient's Assistance Agreement. Funds necessary to meet such financial obligations will be disbursed\nto Program Beneficiaries, Subrecipients, Contractors, or any other third parties which are due payment\nafter a Notice of Exclusive Control is issued.  \nNote further that a financial obligation to a third party for Financial Assistance is deemed “properly\nincurred” per 2 CFR 200.343 if it is a legally-binding, arms-length agreement where funds are transferred\nto the ‘Reserve Account' in accordance with these terms and conditions. Any Notice of Exclusive Control\nshall not include any such funds. Funds necessary to meet such financial obligations for Financial\nAssistance will be disbursed to Program Beneficiaries, Subrecipients, Contractors, or any other third\nparties which are due payment after a Notice of Exclusive Control over other funds in the Deposit\nAccount is issued.\nFunds held in the Recipient's account at the Financial Agent may be invested in accordance with the\nCash Management Requirements in the Financial Risk Management Programmatic Term and Condition.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 58\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 106 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 59\nThe Financial Agent will be compensated in accordance with the terms of a valid Financial Agency\nAgreement (FAA).\nThe Deposit Account will consist of three distinct account types (‘Budget,' ‘Reserve', and ‘Program\nIncome from Operations'), each of which serves a distinct purpose (while the exact naming convention\nand structure of these accounts may differ from the below, the accounts must perform a substantively\nsimilar function). The Recipient is required to utilize the accounts at the Financial Agent for their intended\npurpose during any period in which the accounts are available and accessible, with exceptions to this\nrequirement permitted by the EPA Project Officer only on a case-by-case basis, to the extent such\nexceptions are necessary to execute against the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement.\n1. Budget Account\nThis account within the Deposit Account will hold funds that have yet to be used for any of the following\nallowable activities: Capitalization Funding; Technical Assistance Subawards; Technical Assistance\nServices; and Program Administration Activities. It will hold funds within a number of sub-accounts that\ncorrespond to more specific allowable expenditures under the particular type of award or subaward.\nTransferring Funds Into the Budget Account. Upon establishment of the Deposit Account, the Recipient\nwill drawdown the entire available EPA award balance from ASAP directly into the Budget Account. The\nRecipient will direct the Financial Agent to allocate funds across the various sub-accounts in the Budget\nAccount in accordance with its workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement. Recipient need not\nsubmit a certification notice to transfer funds within the Budget Account, but remains subject to the\nTransfer of Funds EPA General Term and Condition and any associated pre-approval or notification\nrequirements therein.\nTransferring Funds Out of the Budget Account.

The\ncertification must include the following language: “This certification is a material representation for the\npurposes of an EPA Financial Assistance Agreement, and knowing and willful false statements may be\nsubject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative\nsanctions”. In accordance with 2 CFR 200.337, the Recipient must make those certifications available to\nthe EPA, upon request.\nWhile transfers out of the Budget Account are not formally subject to any of the requirements established\nin either the EPA General Term and Condition on Automated Standard Application Payments (ASAP)\nand Proper Payment Draw Down or the Interim Drawdown Procedures Programmatic Term and\nCondition, Recipient agrees to the following requirements:\na) When the need for a longer disbursement window is known in advance of the transfer,\nRecipient must notify the EPA Project Officer prior to executing the transfer and follow-up to\ninform the EPA Project Officer of the amount of the transfer that has been disbursed for an\nAllowable Activity in 5, 10, and 14 business days. Recipient must return any undisbursed\namounts to the Deposit Account at the Financial Agent on the 15th business day, or\nComplaint Exhibit A at 59\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 107 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 60\nb) When the need for a longer disbursement window is not known in advance of the transfer,\nRecipient must notify the EPA Project Officer of the delay no later than 5 business days after the\ntransfer and follow-up to inform the EPA Project Officer of the amount of the transfer that has\nbeen disbursed for an Allowable Activity in 10 and 14 business days.

Reserve Account\nThis account within the Deposit Account is intended to enable Community Lenders to set-aside funds\nwithin the Financial Agent for use for any form of Financial Assistance that requires the Community\nLender to pledge or legally commit award funds for a future expenditure to a third party to meet a legal\nobligation.\nTransferring Funds Into the Reserve Account. The Recipient must ensure that Community Lenders only\ntransfer award funds into the Reserve Account for grant performance purposes if the Community\nLender's chief executive officer (or equivalent), chief financial officer (or equivalent), chief reporting\nofficer (or equivalent), or chief compliance officer (or equivalent) certify to Recipient, with notice provided\nto the Financial Agent with the transfer request, that the amount of the expenditure is necessary to\nexecute against the workplan in effect under this Assistance Agreement, and that financing agreements\nfor identified qualified projects necessitating the expenditure have been reviewed by Community Lender's\ncounsel for legal sufficiency. The certification must include the following language: “This certification is a\nmaterial representation for the purposes of an EPA financial Assistance Agreement and knowing and\nwillful false statements may be subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. 1001 and other applicable\ncriminal, civil and administrative sanctions.” In accordance with 2 CFR 200.337, the Recipient must make\nthose certifications available to the EPA, upon request.\nTransferring Funds Out of the Reserve Account.\na. To Third Parties to Meet Legal Obligations\nFunds in the Reserve Account may not be disbursed to Program Beneficiaries, Subrecipients,\nContractors, or any other third parties, unless the funds are necessary for the Community Lender to\nsatisfy a legal obligation. The Community Lender may only transfer award funds out of the Reserve\nAccount to meet legal obligations to such parties if the Community Lender's chief executive officer (or\nequivalent), chief financial officer (or equivalent), chief reporting officer (or equivalent), or chief\ncompliance officer (or equivalent) certify to the Recipient, with notice provided to the Financial Agent with\nthe transfer request, that the amount of the expenditure is necessary to pay a third party pursuant to a\nfinancing agreement that has been reviewed by Community Lender. The certification must include the\nfollowing language: “This certification is a material representation for the purposes of an EPA financial\nAssistance Agreement and knowing and willful false statements may be subject to prosecution under 18\nU.S.C. 1001 and other applicable criminal, civil and administrative sanctions.” In accordance with 2 CFR\n200.337, the Recipient must make those certifications available to the EPA, upon request.\nComplaint Exhibit A at 60\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938     Document 1     Filed 03/31/25     Page 108 of 133\n5J - 84094101 - 1      Page 61\nWhile transfers out of the Reserve Account are not formally subject to any of the requirements\nestablished in either the EPA General Term and Condition on Automated Standard Application Payments\n(ASAP) and Proper Payment Draw Down or the Interim Drawdown Procedures Programmatic Term and\nCondition, Recipient agrees to hold Community Lenders to the following requirements:\na) When the need for a longer disbursement window is known in advance of the transfer,\nCommunity Lender must notify the Recipient prior to executing the transfer and follow-up to\ninform the Recipient of the amount of the transfer that has been disbursed for an Allowable\nActivity in 5, 10, and 14 business days.

To Program Income from Operations Account\nWhen funds in the Reserve Account are no longer necessary to meet prudent capital management\npractices consistent with the Community Lender's overall risk portfolio and a potential legal obligation to\na third party pursuant to a financing agreement, the Community Lender may transfer such funds to the\nProgram Income from Operations Account. Recipient need not submit a certification notice to effectuate\nsuch a transfer.\n3. Program Income from Operations Account\nThis account within the Deposit Account will enable Program Income from Operations (as defined under\nthe definition of Program Income) to be held, tracked, and segregated in accordance with the Accounting\nPrinciples Programmatic Term and Condition.\nTransferring Funds Into the Program Income from Operations Account.

Action No. 1:25-cv-00938 (TSC) \nv. \n \n \n \nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL \nPROTECTION AGENCY, et al., \n \n                        Defendants. \n \n \nJOINT MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE \n \n  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 42(a)(2), the parties move to \nconsolidate this case with the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) cases already \nconsolidated under Civ. Action No. 1:25-cv-00698 (TSC).  The GGRF cases contain \ncommon questions of law and fact.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nissued the GGRF grants under 42 U.S.C. § 7434 at similar times utilizing similar grant \nagreements with common terms.  The GGRF grants use a designated financial agent \n(Citibank) to hold the GGRF grant funds and administer program distributions.  And EPA \nsent termination notices regarding the GGRF grants agreements at similar times upon \nsimilar bases.   \nJustic Climate Fund (JCF) filed suit against the same defendants as those in the  \nconsolidated action, alleging similar claims under the Administrative Procedure Act \n(APA), and the Appropriations and Due Process clauses of the U.S. Constitution.  JCF’s \nclaims implicate common factual and legal questions now before the Court in the \nconsolidated case, including whether termination complied with statutes and regulations, \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938-TSC     Document 13     Filed 04/10/25     Page 2 of 4\nand whether the Court has jurisdiction to address plaintiffs’ claims.  Therefore, \nconsolidation is warranted. \nThe plaintiffs in the consolidated action moved for preliminary injunctions, as \ndoes JCF.  Because JCF’s motion has common questions of law and fact and seeks \ncommon relief as the motions for preliminary injunction in the consolidated action, the \nparties agree to stay briefing on JCF’s motion for preliminary injunction pending the \nCourt’s ruling in the consolidated case.  The parties further agree that if the Court \nconsolidates this case with No. 1:25-cv-00698, the Court’s decision on the pending \nmotions for preliminary injunction will apply to this case as it does to the previously-\nconsolidated cases.1   \nThe parties to this case (JCF, the federal defendants, and Citibank) may submit a \nJoint Status Report to the Court within seven days of any decision by the Court on the \nmotions for preliminary injunction in No. 1:25-cv-00698 setting forth whether there are \nany additional issues specific to JCF that one or more of the parties assert the Court \nshould address. \n \n1 If the Court issues a preliminary injunction in No. 1:25-cv-00698 that dissolves the \ntemporary restraining order entered in that case before consolidation of this case with No. \n1:25-cv-00698, defendants agree that they will continue not to take any steps to move \nJCF’s grant funds out of Citibank or exercise control over JCF’s Citibank account.  That \nagreement will end upon the earlier of (1) consolidation (at which time the Court’s \ndecision in No. 1:25-cv-00698 will be applicable to JCF), (2)  any separate decision on \nJCF’s motion for preliminary injunction, or (3) seven days following e-mail notice by the \nfederal defendants ending this agreement. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00938-TSC     Document 13     Filed 04/10/25     Page 3 of 4\nFor these reasons, the parties respectfully move the Court to consolidate this case \nwith the already consolidated lawsuit under 1:25-cv-00698, as indicated in the attached \nproposed order.  \nDated: April 10, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n            YAAKOV ROTH \n            Acting Assistant Attorney General \n \nKIRK T.
