Represented by private counsel, EDF sought declaratory judgment that DOT and CEQ violated FOIA and an order compelling both agencies to release all requested records. Judge Tanya S. Chutkan was assigned to the case.</p>\r\n<p>EDF&rsquo;s FOIA requests, submitted to DOT on January 31, 2025, and to CEQ on February 3, 2025, sought records related to agency actions affecting fuel economy standards and vehicle pollution controls. EDF focused on documents concerning Executive Orders 14154 (&ldquo;Unleashing American Energy&rdquo;) and 14148 (&ldquo;Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions&rdquo;), which directed agencies to review and potentially revise fuel economy standards and domestic energy regulations. EDF also sought records of related agency actions, including a memorandum from the Secretary of Transportation to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), indicating plans to weaken fuel economy standards and possibly revoke California&rsquo;s Clean Air Act waivers.</p>\r\n<p>EDF argued that weakening these standards would increase pollution, raise consumer fuel costs, and extend U.S. dependence on oil. The complaint cited projected benefits of existing standards, including billions in fuel savings, reduced carbon emissions, and public health benefits from improved air quality. EDF emphasized that public access to these records was critical to evaluate the administration&rsquo;s plans and understand agency interactions with industry stakeholders. Although DOT and CEQ acknowledged receiving EDF&rsquo;s requests, neither agency provided records or issued determinations within FOIA&rsquo;s 20-working-day deadline, which EDF alleged unlawfully deprived the public of timely access to vital environmental policy information.</p>\r\n<p>On June 30, 2025, CEQ, DOT, and EDF filed a joint status report. The status report focused on four issues: 1) The status of EDF&rsquo;s FOIA request; 2) The anticipated number of documents EDF requested and likely release date; 3) CEQ and DOT&rsquo;s arguments in support of the court granting an &ldquo;Open America&rdquo; stay, which is issued by a court when a defendant agency needs additional time to reach a FOIA request because of a backlog in requests; and 4) If a Vaughn Index, where defendant agencies justify for non-disclosure, will be required in this case.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Those standards are now under threat. The new presidential administration \nhas indicated an intent to undermine, if not seek to eliminate, those standards and to terminate \nClean Air Act preemption waivers that allow California to adopt clean transportation standards. \nThese potential changes would increase health-harming and climate-destabilizing pollution from \nthe transportation sector, leaving Americans vulnerable to significant harm from this pollution. \nTo bring greater transparency to the new administration’s deeply harmful plans, Plaintiff \nEnvironmental Defense Fund (“EDF”) submitted Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) requests \nto the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), which promulgates vehicle fuel economy \nstandards, and the U.S. Council on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”), which coordinates closely \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 2 of 24\n \nwith DOT and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) on those agencies’ fuel \neconomy and motor vehicle pollution standards and programs. DOT and CEQ (together, the \n“Agencies”) failed to produce any records or make a determination on the FOIA requests by \nFOIA’s statutory deadline, violating EDF’s rights under FOIA and depriving the public of \nrecords of clear and immediate public interest. \nINTRODUCTION \n1.  EDF files this action to enforce the statutory obligations of the Agencies under \nFOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552. \n2.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an Executive Order titled \n“Unleashing American Energy” (the “Energy Executive Order”) in which he directed all federal \nagencies, including the Agencies, to review all existing regulations, orders, guidance documents, \npolicies, and other agency actions related to domestic energy resources, including those \nspecifically related to vehicles. See Unleashing American Energy, Exec. Order 14154 § 3 (Jan. \n20, 2025), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/DCPD-202500121/pdf/DCPD-202500121.pdf. \n3.  The Energy Executive Order states that the new administration’s policy is to \n“eliminate” what it refers to as an “electric vehicle (EV) mandate.” Id. § 2(e). Further, the \nEnergy Executive Order directs agencies to, within 30 days, “develop and begin implementing \naction plans to suspend, revise, or rescind all agency actions identified as unduly burdensome” to \ndomestic energy resources “as expeditiously as possible.” Id. § 3(b). \n4.  In another Day One Executive Order, titled “Initial Rescissions of Harmful \nExecutive Orders and Actions” (the “Rescissions Executive Order”), the President revoked a \nnumber of executive actions taken by the prior administration, including Executive Orders \nrelated to climate change, clean energy, and spurring the production of zero-emission vehicles.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 3 of 24\n \nSee Initial Rescissions of Harmful Executive Orders and Actions, Exec. Order 14148 § 2 (Jan. \n20, 2025), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-28/pdf/2025-01901.pdf.  \n5.  On January 28, 2025, in response to the Energy and Recissions Executive Orders, \nSecretary of Transportation Sean Duffy sent a memorandum directing the National Highway \nTraffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”), within DOT, to “commence an immediate review \nand reconsideration of all existing fuel economy standards applicable to all models of motor \nvehicles produced from model year 2022 forward.”  Memorandum from the Secretary, U.S. \nDep’t of Transp., to Office of Adm’r of NHTSA et al. 3 (Jan. 28, 2025), \nhttps://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/2025-\n01/Signed%20Secretarial%20Memo%20re%20Fixing%20the%20CAFE%20Program.pdf.  \n6.  Among the standards targeted by the Secretary for reconsideration based on the \nEnergy Executive Order are NHTSA’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards \nfor cars and light trucks starting in model year 2027 and fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty \ntrucks and vans starting in model year 2030. See id.; Corporate Average Fuel Economy \nStandards for Passenger Cars and Light Trucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel \nEfficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup Trucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and \nBeyond, 89 Fed. Reg. 52,540 (June 24, 2024). These standards will improve the energy \nefficiency of motor vehicles and provide Americans with more choices for purchasing energy \nefficient vehicles.  \n7.  Additional agency actions potentially targeted pursuant to the Energy Executive \nOrder include EPA’s light- and medium- duty vehicle pollution reduction standards and heavy-\nduty engine and vehicle pollution reduction standards. See, e.g., Multi-Pollutant Emissions \nStandards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty Vehicles, 89 Fed. Reg. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 4 of 24\n \n27,842 (Apr. 18, 2024); Control of Air Pollution From New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine \nand Vehicle Standards, 88 Fed. Reg. 4,296 (Jan. 24, 2023); Greenhouse Gas Emissions \nStandards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles—Phase 3, 89 Fed. Reg. 29,440 (Apr. 22, 2024).  \n8.  DOT worked with EPA during its finalization of those standards, which provide \nsubstantial reductions in climate pollution and crucial benefits to air quality and public health.  \nSee NHTSA Press Release: USDOT Finalizes New Fuel Economy Standards for Model Years \n2027-2031 (June 7, 2024), https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/new-fuel-economy-standards-\nmodel-years-2027-2031.  \n9.  CEQ is charged with implementing the National Environmental Policy Act, \nthrough which DOT was directed to assess the impacts of the above-referenced standards and \nissue an Environmental Impact Statement. \n10.  The Energy Executive Order also calls for “terminating, where appropriate, state \nemissions waivers” related to vehicle standards. Energy Exec. Order § 2(e). These “state \nemissions waivers” are statutorily authorized waivers of Clean Air Act preemption for California \nprograms that reduce air pollution from vehicles, thereby allowing California to adopt clean \ntransportation standards that are more protective than federal standards. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7543(b)(1). The Clean Air Act provides other states and the District of Columbia the option to \nadopt California’s more protective standards to reduce air pollution in their jurisdictions. Id. \n§ 7507. Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have exercised this authority to adopt some \nor all of California’s vehicle emissions standards.  \n11.  On January 24, 2025, EPA moved to hold litigation concerning one such waiver \nin abeyance, stating that the new administration has decided to reassess the basis for EPA’s prior \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 5 of 24\n \nreinstatement of the waiver. EPA’s motion demonstrates an intent to reassess and potentially \nseek to invalidate the waiver. \n12.  Additionally, on March 12, 2025, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced plans \nto reconsider EPA’s light- and medium- duty vehicle pollution reduction standards and heavy-\nduty vehicle pollution reduction standards. EPA, EPA Announces Action to Implement POTUS’s \nTermination of Biden-Harris Electric Vehicle Mandate (Mar. 12, 2025), \nhttps://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-announces-action-implement-potuss-termination-biden-\nharris-electric-vehicle.  \n13.  Any action to weaken or eliminate NHTSA’s fuel economy and fuel efficiency \nstandards and EPA’s vehicle pollution reduction standards and programs will result in significant \nemissions of harmful climate and air pollution from the transportation sector, increase costs to \nconsumers, and perpetuate the country’s dependence on oil. \n14.  Specifically, according to NHTSA, through 2050, the fuel economy and fuel \nefficiency standards “will save consumers nearly $23 billion in fuel costs and avoid the \nconsumption of about 70 billion gallons of gasoline (equivalent),” as well as “prevent more than \n710 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.” NHTSA, June 7, 2024: NHTSA \nAnnounces Final Rule for CAFE and HDPUV Standards (June 2024), \nhttps://www.nhtsa.gov/laws-regulations/corporate-average-fuel-economy. \n15.  According to EPA, its light- and medium-duty vehicle emissions standards alone \nare expected to “avoid more than 7 billion tons of carbon emissions and provide nearly $100 \nbillion of annual net benefits to society, including $13 billion of annual public health benefits \ndue to improved air quality, and $62 billion in reduced annual fuel costs, and maintenance and \nrepair costs for drivers.” EPA, What They Are Saying: Strongest ever pollution standards for \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 6 of 24\n \ncars will reduce pollution, create jobs, cut costs, and ensure companies and workers lead the \nclean vehicle future (Mar. 20, 2024), https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/what-they-are-saying-\nstrongest-ever-pollution-standards-cars-will-reduce-pollution.  \n16.  EPA estimates that its heavy-duty GHG emissions standards will avoid an \nadditional approximately 1 billion metric tons of GHG emissions and produce $13 billion in \nannualized net benefits. EPA, Regulatory Announcement: Final Standards to Reduce \nGreenhouse Gas Emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles for Model Year 2027 and Beyond (Mar. \n2024), https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi?Dockey=P101A93K.pdf.  \n17.  Rolling back or rescinding NHTSA’s and EPA’s standards would impair these \nprojected avoided air pollution emissions and the resulting benefits.  \nDOT FOIA Request \n18.  On January 31, 2025, EDF submitted a FOIA request to DOT (“DOT FOIA \nRequest”) seeking correspondence and records of DOT transition team members and political \nappointees related to changes to Clean Air Act or Energy Policy and Conservation Act vehicle \npollution reduction or fuel economy programs. See Ex. A at 2-4 (Letter from Erin Murphy, EDF, \nto National Freedom of Information Officer, DOT). EDF noted that its request for DOT records \nincluded a request for NHTSA records. Id. at 2. \n19.  That same day, January 31, EDF received a letter from DOT acknowledging \nreceipt of the DOT FOIA Request. Ex. B (Letter from Darlene Wallace, DOT, to Erin Murphy, \nEDF).  \n20.  Under FOIA, DOT had 20 working days—until March 3, 2025—to make a \ndetermination on the DOT FOIA Request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see also 49 C.F.R. \n§7.31(a)(2). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 7 of 24\n \n21.  To date, EDF has not received DOT’s determination on the DOT FOIA Request \nand has not received any requested records, in violation of FOIA’s statutory deadline and \nrequirements. \nCEQ FOIA Request \n22.  On February 3, 2025, EDF submitted a FOIA request (“CEQ FOIA Request”) to \nCEQ seeking correspondence and records of CEQ transition team members and political \nappointees related to changes to Clean Air Act or Energy Policy and Conservation Act vehicle \npollution reduction or fuel economy programs. See Ex. C at 1-3 (Email from Erin Murphy, EDF, \nto National Freedom of Information Officer, CEQ).   \n23.  On February 13, 2025, EDF received an email from CEQ acknowledging receipt \nof the CEQ FOIA Request. Ex. D (Email from Hector Vazquez, CEQ, to Erin Murphy, EDF). \n24.  Under FOIA, EPA had 20 working days to make a determination on the CEQ \nFOIA Request. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i); 40 C.F.R. § 1515.6(a) (2024).1 CEQ’s February \n13 email did not state the date on which it received the CEQ FOIA Request. However, even if \nCEQ did not receive the request until February 13, 2025, over a week after EDF sent the request, \nits statutory deadline to make a determination on the CEQ FOIA Request lapsed on March 14, \n2025. \n25.  To date, EDF has not received CEQ’s determination on the CEQ FOIA Request \nor any requested records, in violation of the statutory deadlines and other requirements of FOIA.  \n \n1 CEQ revised its FOIA regulations in early 2025, with the revisions effective February 20, 2025. \n90 Fed. Reg. 6828, 6828 (Jan. 21, 2025). EDF submitted the CEQ FOIA Request prior to that \ndate and accordingly cites to the 2024 version of the CEQ FOIA regulations in this complaint. \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 8 of 24\n \nImportance of the FOIA Requests \n26.  The public, including EDF and its members, has a strong interest in any records \nrelated to the current administration’s actions to weaken or eliminate vehicle pollution reduction \nor fuel economy programs and standards. These programs and standards achieve substantial \nreductions in climate- and health-harming pollution and save consumers money, yet the current \nadministration has made it a policy priority to undermine them.  \n27.  Knowledge of the extent and nature of communications between certain DOT and \nCEQ transition team members, political appointees, and external stakeholders is critical for EDF, \nits members, and the public to understand DOT and CEQ actions relating to the future of federal \nvehicle pollution reduction and fuel economy programs and standards, and will shed light on \nDOT’s and CEQ’s interactions with a range of stakeholders, including industry groups. EDF \nsubmitted FOIA requests to the Agencies to bring transparency to these records.  \n28.  EDF requested the information in order to disseminate it to EDF’s members, \nsupporters, and the general public. EDF also plans to use its expertise to analyze the records and \nhelp the public understand their significance. \n29.  The Agencies are unlawfully withholding and unreasonably delaying the release \nof records requested by EDF and to which EDF is lawfully entitled under FOIA, despite the \nrecords’ clear salience to current agency actions with grave implications for public health and \nwelfare.  \n30.  EDF seeks declaratory and injunctive relief declaring that DOT and CEQ have \nviolated FOIA and an order compelling the Agencies to promptly release all requested records. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 9 of 24\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n31.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to FOIA, which vests \njurisdiction in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). This \nCourt also has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under FOIA, a \nfederal statute.  \n32.  Injunctive relief is appropriate under FOIA. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). Declaratory \nrelief is appropriate under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. \n33.  Venue is proper in this judicial district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B) and \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n34.  Plaintiff EDF is a 501(c)(3) non-profit environmental organization dedicated to \nfinding practical solutions to critical environmental problems through the use of law, policy, \nscience, and economics. EDF has offices throughout the United States, including in the District \nof Columbia. \n35.  EDF engages in extensive, daily efforts to inform the public about matters \naffecting environmental and energy policy, including about vehicles and transportation. EDF has \nmultiple channels for distributing information to the public, including through direct \ncommunication with its more than three million members and supporters, press releases, blog \nposts, and active engagement on social media. EDF is frequently called upon to share its \nexpertise on important environmental issues in the media and in other public forums.   \n36.  EDF has long advocated for measures to protect communities from the deleterious \neffects of air pollution and climate change. EDF advocated for and supported protective vehicle \npollution reduction and fuel economy standards and programs—standards and programs that are \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 10 of 24\n \nnow under threat from the Energy Executive Order. These standards and programs significantly \nreduce greenhouse gas and other harmful air pollution emissions from light-, medium-, and \nheavy-duty vehicles.  \n37.  EDF is injured by the Agencies’ failure to timely produce public records that were \nproperly requested and to which EDF is entitled under FOIA. See Zivotofsky v. Sec’y of State, \n444 F.3d 614, 617-18 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (“The requester is injured-in-fact for standing purposes \nbecause he does not get what the statute entitles him to receive.”). \n38.  Defendant DOT is an executive department of the United States and is therefore \nan “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) and subject to FOIA. DOT has \npossession and control of the requested records and is responsible for fulfilling the DOT FOIA \nRequest. \n39.  Defendant CEQ is an establishment in the executive branch of the United States \ngovernment and is therefore an “agency” within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. § 552(f)(1) and subject \nto FOIA. CEQ has possession and control of the requested records and is responsible for \nfulfilling the CEQ FOIA Request.  \nLEGAL BACKGROUND \n40.  FOIA requires a federal agency to make public records “promptly available”—\nsubject to enumerated exemptions—to any person who makes a request that reasonably describes \nthe records sought and complies with the agency’s rules for making such a request. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(3)(A).  \n41.  FOIA requires the agency to issue a determination on a FOIA request within 20 \nworking days from the date of receipt. Id. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 11 of 24\n \n42.  The agency’s determination on a FOIA request shall contain (1) the agency’s \ndetermination of whether to comply with the request and provide responsive records, (2) the \nreasons for the agency’s determination, and (3) notice of the right of the requester to appeal an \nadverse determination to the head of the agency. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i).  \n43.  Mere notice of the agency’s receipt of the request does not suffice for a \n“determination,” nor is it enough that “within the relevant time period, the agency simply decide \nto later decide.” Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 711 F.3d 180, \n186 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Instead, “the agency must at least inform the requester of the scope of the \ndocuments that the agency will produce, as well as the scope of the documents that the agency \nplans to withhold under any FOIA exemptions.” Id.   \n44.  A FOIA requester may seek “expedited processing” of a request for records, and a \ndetermination on a request for expedited processing must be made, and notice of that \ndetermination provided to the requester, within 10 days of the date of the request. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(E)(ii)(II). \n45.  FOIA allows the agency to extend the 20-working-day deadline by up to 10 \nadditional working days for “unusual circumstances” by providing written notice to the requester \nthat describes the “unusual circumstances” and provides the date on which the determination is \nexpected to be issued. Id. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i). \n46.  If the agency fails to comply with FOIA’s statutory deadline for issuing a \ndetermination on a request, the requester is deemed to have exhausted its administrative remedies \nand may file suit against the agency. Id. § 552(a)(6)(C)(i). \n47.  Under FOIA, an agency shall waive or reduce fees and costs incurred in \nresponding to a FOIA request “if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 12 of 24\n \nis likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operation or activities of the \ngovernment and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.” Id. \n§ 552(a)(4)(A)(iii). \n48.  This Court interprets FOIA’s fee waiver provision to require that an agency’s \ndetermination on a request for a fee waiver be made within the 20-working-day period. Pub \nCitizen, Inc. v. Dep’t of Educ., 292 F. Supp. 2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2003) (“[I]f the agency fails to \nrespond to a waiver request within 20 days, the requester is deemed to have constructively \nexhausted administrative remedies and may seek judicial review.”). \n49.  The agency bears the burden to prove the legality of its actions under FOIA. \n5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). \n50.  FOIA grants jurisdiction to the court “to enjoin the agency from withholding \nagency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the \ncomplainant.” Id.  \n51.  Under FOIA, this Court may assess attorney fees and costs against the United \nStates if EDF substantially prevails in this action. Id. § 552(a)(4)(E). \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  NHTSA Fuel Economy and Fuel Efficiency Standards \n52.  On June 24, 2024, NHTSA adopted fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks \nstarting in model year 2027 and fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty trucks and vans starting \nmodel year 2030. See Corporate Average Fuel Economy Standards for Passenger Cars and Light \nTrucks for Model Years 2027 and Beyond and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Heavy-Duty Pickup \nTrucks and Vans for Model Years 2030 and Beyond, 89 Fed. Reg. at 52,540. These standards are \na  continuation  of  NHTSA’s  congressionally  directed  efforts  since  1975  to  promote  the \nconservation of energy supplies and improve the energy efficiency of motor vehicles, providing \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 13 of 24\n \nAmericans with more choices for purchasing energy efficient vehicles. Further, by increasing fuel \neconomy in the targeted vehicle classes, these standards help reduce harmful emissions, protecting \nthe public from the detrimental health effects of air pollution. \n53.  Despite NHTSA’s finalization of these standards, and the public’s reliance on these \nactions, the Energy Executive Order indicates that the White House seeks to undermine them, and \nSecretary Duffy’s January 28 memorandum demonstrates that efforts to do so are underway. \nB.  Clean Air Act Preemption Waivers \n54.  The Clean Air Act preempts states from adopting standards “relating to the \ncontrol of emissions from new motor vehicles or new motor vehicle engines.” 42 U.S.C. \n§ 7543(a). Since its enactment, the Clean Air Act has also included a waiver provision that \nallows California to adopt new motor vehicle emissions standards that are more protective than \nfederal standards, allowing the state to protect Californians from air pollution from new cars and \ntrucks. See 42 U.S.C. § 7543(b)(1) (directing that EPA “shall,” subject to limited conditions, \n“waive application of” the prohibition on States and localities from enforcing their own \nemissions standards for new motor vehicles with respect to California, which had vehicle \nemissions standards in place prior to 1966). For more than half a century, EPA has granted \npreemption waivers for various vehicle emissions standards promulgated by California that are \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 14 of 24\n \nmore protective than federal standards, including: (1) Advanced Clean Cars I;2 (2) Advanced \nClean Trucks;3 (3) Advanced Clean Cars II;4 and (4) Omnibus Low NOx Regulations.5   \n55.  The Clean Air Act also authorizes other states and the District of Columbia to \nadopt California’s more protective vehicle emissions standards to reduce air pollution in their \njurisdictions. 42 U.S.C. § 7507. Sixteen states—Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, \nMaryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, \nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, and Washington—and the District of Columbia \nhave adopted all or some of California’s vehicle emissions standards under this authority.  \n56.  Despite the longstanding and time-tested nature of these authorities, and states’ \nand the public’s reliance on the substantial health protections they confer, the Energy Executive \nOrder indicates that the White House intends to “terminate” the waivers.  \n57.  In a January 24, 2025 motion to hold litigation concerning the Advanced Clean \nCars I waiver in abeyance, EPA stated: “After the change in Administration, EPA’s Acting \nAdministrator has determined that the agency should reassess the basis for and soundness of the \n \n2 California State Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Standards; Notice of Decision Granting a \nWaiver of Clean Air Act Preemption for California’s Advanced Clean Car Program and Within \nthe Scope Confirmation for California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Amendments for 2017 and \nEarlier Models, 78 Fed.

Respondents to Hold Briefing Schedule in Abeyance \nat 3, Diamond Alt. Energy v. EPA, No. 24-7 (U.S. Jan. 24, 2025), \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-7/340121/20250124143604732_24-\n7%20Diamond%20Abeyance%20Mot_f.pdf.  \n58.  EPA’s motion demonstrates an intent to reassess and potentially seek to invalidate \nthe waivers. \nC.  Light- and Medium-Duty Vehicle Multi-Pollutant Standards \n59.  On April 18, 2024, EPA finalized standards to reduce greenhouse gases and other \nharmful air pollutants for model year 2027-2032 light- and medium-duty vehicles. See Multi-\nPollutant Emissions Standards for Model Years 2027 and Later Light-Duty and Medium-Duty \nVehicles, 89 Fed. Reg. 27,842. These standards are a continuation of EPA’s congressionally \ndirected efforts over more than 50 years to set motor vehicle emissions standards to protect the \npublic from the effects of harmful air pollution, including efforts since 2010 to reduce harmful \nclimate pollution.  \n60.  Despite EPA’s finalization of these standards, and the public’s reliance on this \naction, the Energy Executive Order indicates that the White House seeks to undermine them, and \nEPA Administrator Zeldin’s March 12 announcement demonstrates that efforts to do so are \nunderway.  \nD.  Heavy-Duty Vehicle NOX Pollution and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Standards \n61.  EPA has also adopted motor vehicle pollution reduction standards to reduce \npollution from heavy-duty vehicles. On January 24, 2023, EPA finalized emissions standards to \nreduce nitrogen oxide (“NO ”) emissions from heavy-duty vehicles and engines starting in \nX\nmodel year 2027. See Control of Air Pollution from New Motor Vehicles: Heavy-Duty Engine \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 16 of 24\n \nand Vehicle Standards, 88 Fed. Reg. 4,296. On April 22, 2024, EPA finalized greenhouse gas \nemissions standards for heavy-duty vehicles for model year 2027 and later. See Greenhouse Gas \nEmissions Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles—Phase 3, 89 Fed. Reg. 29,440. Like EPA’s light- \nand medium-duty pollution reduction standards, these standards continue decades of EPA’s \nefforts to protect the public from the effects of harmful air pollution, including efforts to reduce \nclimate pollution.  \n62.  Despite EPA’s finalization of these standards, and the public’s reliance on these \nactions, the Energy Executive Order indicates that the White House seeks to undermine them, \nand EPA Administrator Zeldin’s March 12 announcement demonstrates that efforts to do so are \nunderway. \nE.  EDF’s FOIA Request to DOT Regarding Vehicle Pollution Reduction and Fuel \nEconomy Standards (Request No. OST-2025-1096) \n63.  On January 31, 2025, EDF submitted the DOT FOIA request to DOT seeking: \n(i) all correspondence and records with or between twelve DOT transition team members and \npolitical appointees containing twenty-five specific search terms related to changes to Clean Air \nAct or Energy Policy and Conservation Act vehicle pollution reduction or fuel economy \nprograms; and (ii) all correspondence between any of those twelve individuals and any external, \nnon-governmental stakeholders (including but not limited to seven specific industry \nstakeholders) containing those same search terms. See Ex. A at 2-4. EDF noted that its request \nfor DOT records included a request for NHTSA records. Id. at 2. \n64.  Given the new administration’s fast-moving efforts to weaken EPA’s vehicle \npollution reduction standards and programs and NHTSA’s fuel economy and fuel efficiency \nstandards, the significant public impacts anticipated if those efforts are successful, and EDF’s \nstrong interest in understanding and publicly sharing the basis for any such changes, EDF \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 17 of 24\n \nrequested expedited processing of the DOT FOIA Request. Id. at 4-10; see also 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I); 49 C.F.R. §7.31(c). \n65.  EDF also requested a waiver of fees associated with the DOT FOIA Request. \nEx. A at 10-12; see also 49 C.F.R. §§ 7.24(b), 7.43(c). \n66.  On January 31, 2025, the same day EDF submitted the DOT FOIA Request, EDF \nreceived a letter from DOT acknowledging receipt of the request. Ex. B.  \n67.  On February 26, 2025, EDF received a letter from DOT denying EDF’s request \nfor expedited processing. Ex. E at 2 (Letter from Michael Bell, DOT, to Erin Murphy, EDF).  \n68.  Neither the January 31 DOT letter nor the February 26 DOT letter addressed \nEDF’s request for a fee waiver. Exs. B, E.  \n69.  The deadline for a determination on EDF’s request for a fee waiver lapsed 20 \nworkdays after receipt of the DOT FOIA Request, on March 3, 2025. See Pub. Citizen, Inc., 292 \nF. Supp. 2d at 4. \n70.  The January 31 and February 26 DOT letters did not inform EDF of the scope of \nthe documents the agency will produce or the scope of the documents the agency plans to \nwithhold under any FOIA exemptions. See Exs. B, E. \n71.  The January 31 and February 26 DOT letters were not DOT’s determination on \nthe DOT FOIA Request. \n72.  The January 31 and February 26 DOT letters did not extend DOT’s deadline for \nissuing a determination on the DOT FOIA Request. \n73.  As of the date of filing this complaint, the DOT FOIA Public Access Link (PAL) \nwebsite identifies the status of the DOT FOIA Request as “Assigned for Processing” and does \nnot provide any estimated completion date. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 18 of 24\n \n74.  DOT did not provide a determination on the DOT FOIA Request within the \n20-working-day deadline, which lapsed on March 3, 2025. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i); see \nalso 49 C.F.R. §7.31(a)(2). \n75.  DOT did not provide notice to EDF that it was extending the 20-working-day \ndeadline. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i); 49 C.F.R. § 7.34. \n76.  To date, DOT has not issued a determination on the DOT FOIA Request. \n77.  To date, DOT has not produced any records in response to the DOT FOIA \nRequest.  \n78.  To date, DOT has not issued a determination on EDF’s request for a fee waiver. \n79.  DOT’s participation in the evaluation of vehicle pollution reduction and fuel \neconomy and efficiency standards and programs as directed by the Energy and Rescission \nExecutive Orders and Secretary Duffy’s memorandum is ongoing. \n80.  DOT’s failure to respond to the DOT FOIA Request within the required \ntimeframe has prevented EDF, its members, and the general public from being fully informed \nand able to meaningfully engage on this issue. \nF.  EDF’s FOIA Request to CEQ Regarding Vehicle Pollution Reduction and Fuel \nEconomy Standards (Request No. FY2025-239) \n81.  On February 3, 2025, EDF submitted the CEQ FOIA Request to CEQ seeking: \n(i) all correspondence and records with or between any CEQ transition team members and \npolitical appointees containing twenty-two specific search terms related to changes to Clean Air \nAct or Energy Policy and Conservation Act vehicle pollution reduction or fuel economy \nprograms; and (ii) all correspondence between any CEQ transition team members and political \nappointees and any external, non-governmental stakeholders (including but not limited to seven \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 19 of 24\n \nspecific industry stakeholders and their representatives) containing those same search terms. See \nEx. C at 1-3.  \n82.  Given the new administration’s fast-moving efforts to weaken EPA’s vehicle \npollution reduction standards and programs and NHTSA’s fuel economy and fuel efficiency \nstandards, the significant public impacts anticipated if those efforts are successful, and EDF’s \nstrong interest in understanding and publicly sharing the basis for any such changes, EDF \nrequested expedited processing of the CEQ FOIA Request. Id. at 3-8; see also 5 U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(6)(E)(i)(I); 40 C.F.R. § 1515.7(a) (2024).   \n83.  EDF also requested a waiver of fees associated with the CEQ FOIA Request. \nEx. C at 8-9; see also 40 C.F.R. § 1515.15(b) (2024).  \n84.  On February 13, 2025, EDF received an email from CEQ acknowledging receipt \nof the CEQ FOIA Request, though the email did not provide a date of receipt. The EDF email \ndenied EDF’s request for expedited processing and delayed making a fee waiver determination \nto a later time. Ex. D.  \n85.  On March 12, 2025, EDF received an email from CEQ requesting that EDF \n“provide a date range” for the FOIA request. Ex. F (Excerpt of email exchange between Hector \nVazquez, CEQ, and Erin Murphy, EDF). \n86.  EDF responded that same day, reiterating the date range originally provided in the \nFebruary 3 FOIA Request. Id. \n87.  The February 13 and March 12 CEQ emails did not inform EDF of the scope of \nthe documents the agency will produce or the scope of the documents the agency plans to \nwithhold under any FOIA exemptions. See Exs. D, F. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 20 of 24\n \n88.  The February 13 and March 12 CEQ emails were not CEQ’s determination on the \nCEQ FOIA Request. \n89.  The February 13 and March 12 CEQ emails did not extend CEQ’s deadline for \nissuing a determination on the CEQ FOIA Request. \n90.  On April 2, 2025, EDF called one of the contact phone numbers provided in the \nFebruary 13 email. Erin Murphy, EDF, spoke with Howard Sun, CEQ, who conveyed that the \nagency is still in the process of searching for responsive records, and was not able to provide an \nestimated completion date, though Mr. Sun mentioned that his colleague may provide more \ninformation. On April 3, 2025, Hector Vazquez, CEQ, called Erin Murphy, EDF, about the status \nof the CEQ FOIA Request and similarly stated that the search for records is underway but he \ncould not provide an estimated completion date.    \n91.  Under FOIA, CEQ had 20 working days to make a determination on the FOIA \nRequest. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i); 40 C.F.R. § 1515.6(a) (2024). CEQ’s February 13 and \nMarch 12 emails did not state the date on which it received the CEQ FOIA Request. However, \neven if CEQ did not receive the request until February 13, 2025, ten days after EDF sent the \nrequest, its statutory deadline to make a determination on the CEQ FOIA Request lapsed on \nMarch 14, 2025.  \n92.  CEQ did not provide EDF with written notice that it was extending that deadline. \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(B)(i); 40 C.F.R. § 1515.9 (2024). \n93.  To date, CEQ has not issued a determination on the CEQ FOIA Request. \n94.  To date, CEQ has not produced any records in response to the CEQ FOIA \nRequest.  \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00996     Document 1     Filed 04/03/25     Page 21 of 24\n \n95.
