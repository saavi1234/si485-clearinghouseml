Accordingly, under Freiser, I find that it is appropriate to permit this habeas action to proceed on a class-wide basis. Based on the foregoing, I certify a class, for purposes of this habeas action, designated as follows: All noncitizens in U.S. custody in the Southern District of New York who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation, who have not been given notice following the Supreme Court's decision of April 7, 2025, Trump v. JG.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, and granted a hearing. The notice to be provided shall be written in English and Spanish, the language of those sought to be expelled, and if needed, Spanish-to-English interpreters shall be provided for hearings. I appoint Petitioners G.F.F. and J.G.O. as Class Representatives, and I further appoint Petitioners' counsel, attorneys of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democracy Forward Foundation, as class counsel. The issue of what hearing is required under the AEA, whether in this Court, or some other forum, is reserved for further consideration at the preliminary injunction hearing, which will be held on April 22, 2025, at 2:30 p.m., in Courtroom 14D. Since there is no need now to determine the validity of the Presidential Proclamation or the applicability of the AEA, I deny that part of the motion as premature. The Clerk of Court shall terminate ECF No. 4. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein on 4/9/2025) (jjc) (Entered: 04/09/2025)"

Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, here, the facts are akin to those in Freiser, since many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions. \"The approach laid out by the Freiser court is, in short, both flexible and sensitive to the particular circumstances of a given case.\" Martinez-Brooks v.

    "summary": "<p>This is one of several challenges to the Trump Administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\") to circumvent removal procedures and deport Venezuelan nationals without due process. You can see all of the cases <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&amp;plaintiff_description=Alien+Enemies+Act&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>On April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (&ldquo;DHS&rdquo;), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (&ldquo;ICE&rdquo;), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Represented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration&rsquo;s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was &ldquo;under invasion&rdquo; by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. The case was assigned to Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein.</p>\r\n<p>This action was spurred by the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <a href=\"../../../../case/46232/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">J.G.G. v. Trump</a> that challenges to removals under the AEA must be brought in a habeas petition. The Court in that case vacated a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") against removal of the plaintiffs because it found the venue, the District Court for the District of Columbia, to be inappropriate, since habeas petitions should be brought in the district of confinement.</p>\r\n<p>Along with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. A hearing was held on April 9, after which the court issued a TRO. 2025 WL 1166480. The court converted the plaintiffs' TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI) and ordered the respondents to file their response by April 15, with a hearing on the PI motion scheduled for April 22.</p>\r\n<p>Also on April 9, the Court granted the petitioners' request for class certification. 348 F.R.D. 586. The petitioners filed a request for modification of the class certification on April 10, asking the court to amend the definition of the certified class by \"removing the requirement that class members be in the custody of the United States, to ensure that the class includes individuals subject to the Presidential Proclamation who are in state or local custody.\" The court made the requested modification on April 11 and also amended the TRO to reflect the new class definition.2025 WL 1166911.</p>\r\n<p>The respondents filed a motion to decertify the class on April 21, arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction to review and enjoin the federal government's activities at issue in this case; namely, the President's exercise of authority under the AEA.</p>\r\n<p>Following the April 22 hearing on the PI motion, the court extended the TRO until the court ruled on the PI motion. 2025 WL 1166450.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 6, Judge Hellerstein granted the petitioners motion for a preliminary injunction and enjoined the government from the following:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Enforcing, in the Southern District of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \"Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua,\" and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation. 781 F.Supp.3d 195.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Judge Hellerstein also ordered the government not to transfer Petitioners including the members of the Certified&nbsp;Class from the Southern District of New York.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the same hearing, Judge Hellerstein denied the government's April 21 motion to decertify the class, noting:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 40px;\">Here, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become subject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and again as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due process for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, . . . many of the Class members cannot speak English, do not have easy access to counsel, and share common questions. 2025 WL 1316563.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 9, the government appealed the class certification and preliminary injunction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Case No. 25-1671).

    "summary_short": "On April 8, 2025, two Venezuelan men filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named as respondents President Donald J. Trump, the Department of Justice, the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), the Department of State, and the Orange County Correctional Facility, a county prison in New York that contracts with ICE where the petitioners are being held. \r\n\r\nRepresented by the ACLU, the petitioners challenged the Administration’s invocation of the AEA to remove them from the United States without any opportunity for a hearing or judicial review. The AEA is a wartime measure that authorizes the removal of citizens from countries with whom the United States is at war. On March 15, 2025, President Trump issued a proclamation declaring that the United States was “under invasion” by Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization, and invoking the AEA. \r\n\r\nThe petitioners alleged that this use of the AEA violated the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act, and the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus releasing them from detention, as well as injunctive and declaratory relief. \r\n\r\nAlong with their habeas petition, the petitioners also filed an emergency motion for a TRO and a separate motion to certify the class. The same day the Court ordered that the petitioners were not to be removed from the United States or the Southern District of New York while the case proceeded. The court issued another TRO on April 9, and converted the TRO motion to a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI). Briefing on the PI motion concluded on April 17, and a hearing was held April 22. The court issued a preliminary injunction on April 21.",

Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) are Venezuelan men in immigration custody \nthreatened with imminent removal under the President’s Proclamation—signed in secret on \nMarch 14, 2025, and published the next day—invoking the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), a \nwartime measure that has been used only three times in our Nation’s history: the War of 1812, \nWorld War I and World War II.   \n2.  The Proclamation, Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of \nthe United States by Tren de Aragua (Mar. 15, 2025),1 purportedly authorizes “immediate” \nremoval of noncitizens that the Proclamation deems to be alien enemies, without notice or any \nopportunity for judicial review.  It also contorts the plain language of the AEA: arrivals of \nnoncitizens from Venezuela are deemed an “invasion” or “predatory incursion” by a “foreign \nnation or government,” where Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, is deemed to be sufficiently \nakin to a foreign nation or government. \n3.  But the AEA has only ever been a power invoked in time of war, and plainly only \napplies to warlike actions: it cannot be used here against nationals of a country—Venezuela—\nwith whom the United States is not at war, which is not invading the United States, and which \nhas not launched a predatory incursion into the United States.     \n4.  Pursuant to the Proclamation, on March 15, the government deported at least 137 \nnoncitizens to a notorious prison in El Salvador, without any review of any aspect of the \ndetermination that they are alien enemies.  Petitioners, along with others who may be detained \nacross the country and may not even know about their designations as alien enemies, were \ntemporarily protected from these summary removals pursuant to the court’s order in J.G.G. v. \n \n1 Available at https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 3 of 22\nTrump, No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB (D.D.C.). Multiple judges have already held there is likely no \nauthority for the government’s actions. See J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL 914682, at \n*5–10 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring) (AEA predicates of “invasion” or \n“predatory incursion” not met); id. at *13 (Millett, J., concurring) (“The Constitution’s demand \nof due process cannot be so easily thrown aside.”); J.G.G. v. Trump, No. CV 25-766 (JEB), 2025 \nWL 890401, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025) (Boasberg, J.) (“before [petitioners] may be deported, \nthey are entitled to individualized hearings to determine whether the Act applies to them at all”). \n5.   However, since the Supreme Court stayed that order on the basis that Petitioners \nhad to proceed through habeas, Petitioners and others similarly situated to them are now all at \nimminent risk of removal. In fact, “the government in no uncertain terms [has] conveyed that—\nwere the injunction lifted—it would immediately begin deporting the plaintiffs without notice.” \nJ.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *12 (Henderson, J., concurring). \n6.  With the J.G.G. injunction lifted, the government is resuming its summary \nremovals of Venezuelans who are in ongoing immigration proceedings, including Petitioners \nhere, without any judicial review—including by this Court.  For that reason, Petitioners and the \nputative class that they represent seek this Court’s intervention to temporarily restrain these \nsummary removals, and to determine that this use of the AEA is unlawful and must be stopped.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This case arises under the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21-24; the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. and its implementing \nregulations; the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”), see Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242, 112 \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 4 of 22\nStat. 2681, 2681-822 (1998) (codified as Note to 8 U.S.C. § 1231); the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1651, and the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \n8.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 et seq. (habeas \ncorpus), art. I, § 9, cl. 2 of the U.S. Constitution (Suspension Clause), 28 U.S.C. § 1346 (United \nStates as defendant), 28 U.S.C. § 1361 (mandamus), and 28 U.S.C. § 1651 (All Writs Act).  \n9.  The Court may grant relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241; 28 U.S.C. § 2243; the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq.; the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651; and \nthe Court’s inherent equitable powers.  \n10.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 2241; 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b); and, \n28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because at the time of the filing of this action the Petitioners were \ndetained in the Respondents’ custody within the Southern District of New York; a substantial \npart of the events and omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district; Respondents \nJoyce and Arteta reside in this district; and Respondents are agencies of the United States or \nofficers of the United States acting in their official capacity. \nPARTIES \nA.  Petitioners-Plaintiffs (“Petitioners”) \n11.  Petitioner G.F.F. is a 21-year-old Venezuelan national who is detained at the \nOrange County Correctional Facility in New York, and who, having been nearly removed on \nMarch 15, is at imminent risk of removal under the Proclamation.  G.F.F. entered the United \nStates in May 2024.  G.F.F. and his family fled Venezuela in part due to the threats they faced \nfrom TdA. Moreover, G.F.F. has been threatened by the gang on account of his sexual \norientation. He also fears persecution from Venezuelan state actors, including police and \nparamilitary groups, as well as gang members on account of his sexual orientation and gender \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 5 of 22\nnon-conformity. After entering the U.S., he was released on his own recognizance after a \ncredible fear interview.  G.F.F. was arrested and detained in New York.  Upon his detention, \nDHS filed an I-213 identifying him as an “associate/affiliate of Tren de Aragua.”  On March 9, \n2025, he was moved from Orange County Correctional Facility in New York to Moshannon \nValley Processing Center in Pennsylvania and then quickly to El Valle Detention Facility in \nTexas, transported only with other Venezuelans.  On March 14, 2025, ICE officers told G.F.F. \nthat he was going to be deported in the middle of the night.  Because his immigration counsel \nalerted undersigned counsel, G.F.F. was able to secure a temporary restraining order in J.G.G. \nand pulled off the plane before being deported on March 15. He was then transferred back to \nOrange County Correctional Facility in Goshen, New York, on or about April 4, and now faces \nimminent removal despite having ongoing immigration proceedings and having given testimony \nand offered evidence to support his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and \nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.  \n12.  Petitioner J.G.O. is a 32-year-old Venezuelan national who is detained at the \nOrange County Correctional Facility in New York, and who, having been nearly removed on \nMarch 15, is at imminent risk of removal under the Proclamation.  J.G.O. entered the United \nStates around September 29, 2022, and thereafter submitted an affirmative asylum application \nwith U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.  J.G.O. actively protested against the Maduro \nregime in Venezuela, and ultimately fled because he feared torture, imprisonment, and death on \naccount of his political activism.  On January 30, 2025, ICE officers abruptly arrested J.G.O. at \nhis home and took him into immigration detention, transferred him from Orange County first to \nMoshannon and then, in early March, to El Valle.  On March 12, J.G.O. was told to sign papers \nin English, which is not his native language.  He refused to sign.  An ICE officer told J.G.O. that \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 6 of 22\nhe would be deported on the night of March 14, 15, or 16.  Because his immigration counsel \nalerted undersigned counsel, J.G.O. was able to secure a temporary restraining order in J.G.G. \nand pulled off the plane before being deported on March 15. He was transferred to Orange \nCounty Correctional Facility in Goshen, New York, around April 4, and now faces imminent \nremoval despite being scheduled for an Individual Hearing on May 2, 2025, to present testimony \nand evidence in support of his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection \nunder the Convention Against Torture. \nB.

The AEA is a wartime authority enacted in 1798 that grants the President specific \npowers with respect to the regulation, detention, and deportation of enemy aliens.   \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 8 of 22\n24.  The AEA, as codified today, provides that “[w]henever there is a declared war \nbetween the United States and any foreign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory \nincursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any \nforeign nation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all \nnatives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age of \nfourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually naturalized, \nshall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.”  50 U.S.C. \n§ 21.  \n25.  The AEA can thus be triggered in only two situations.  The first is when a formal \ndeclared war exists with a foreign nation or government.  The second is when a foreign nation or \ngovernment perpetrates, attempts, or threatens an invasion or predatory incursion against the \nterritory of the United States.  \n26.  To trigger the AEA, the President must make a public proclamation of the \ndeclared war, or of the attempted or threatened invasion or predatory incursion.  Id. \n27.  The AEA also provides that noncitizens must be permitted the full time to depart \nas stipulated by any treaty between the United States and the enemy nation, unless the noncitizen \nhas engaged in “actual hostility” against the United States.  If no such treaty exists, the President \nmay declare a “reasonable time” for departure, “according to the dictates of humanity and \nnational hospitality.”  Id. § 22.  \n28.  Under the AEA, noncitizens who “refuse or neglect to depart” are subject to \nremoval.  Id. § 21.  \n29.  The Act has been used only three times in American history, all during actual or \nimminent wartime.   \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 9 of 22\n30.  The AEA was first invoked several months into the War of 1812, but President \nMadison did not use the AEA to remove anyone from the United States during the war. \n31.  The AEA was invoked a second time during World War I by President Wilson.  \nUpon information and belief, there were no removals effectuated pursuant to the AEA during \nWorld War I.   \n32.  The AEA was used again during World War II, though it was never used as a \nwidespread method of removal. \n33.  On December 7, 1941, after the Japanese invaded Hawaii in the attack on Pearl \nHarbor, President Roosevelt proclaimed that Japan had perpetrated an invasion upon the territory \nof the United States.  The president issued regulations applicable to Japanese nationals living in \nthe United States.  The next day Congress declared war on Japan.  \n34.  On the same day, President Roosevelt issued two separate proclamations stating \nthat an invasion or predatory incursion was threatened upon the territory of the United States by \nGermany and Italy.  The president incorporated the same regulations that were already in effect \nas to Japanese people for German and Italian people.  Three days later Congress voted \nunanimously to declare war against Germany and Italy. \n35.  Congress declared war against Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria on June 5, 1942.  \nJust over a month later, President Roosevelt issued a proclamation recognizing that declaration \nof war and invoking the AEA against citizens of those countries.  \n36.  Under these proclamations, the United States infamously interned noncitizens \nfrom Japan, Germany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria (with U.S. citizens of Japanese \ndescent subject to a separate order that did not rely on the AEA).  \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 10 of 22\n37.  It was not until the end of hostilities that the President provided for the removal of \nalien enemies from the United States under the AEA.  On July 14, 1945, President Truman \nissued a proclamation providing that alien enemies detained as a danger to public peace and \nsafety “shall be subject upon the order of the Attorney General to removal from the United \nStates.”  The Department of Justice subsequently issued regulations laying out the removal \nprocess.  See 10 Fed. Reg. 12,189 (Sept. 28, 1945).  It was never used as a widespread method of \nremoval. The regulations required, inter alia, notice of the removal order to be served on the \ndesignated alien enemy and that the alien enemy had thirty (30) days thereafter to depart—during \nwhich time they could seek judicial review of the removal order. Id. \nSystemic Overhaul of Immigration Law in 1952 \n38.  Following the end of World War II, Congress consolidated U.S. immigration laws \ninto a single text under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”).   \n39.  The INA, and its subsequent amendments, provide for a comprehensive system of \nprocedures that the government must follow before removing a noncitizen from the United \nStates.  The INA provides the exclusive procedure by which the government may determine \nwhether to remove an individual.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3).   \n40.  In addition to laying out the process by which the government determines whether \nto remove an individual, the INA also enshrines certain forms of humanitarian protection.  \n41.  First, the INA provides that “[a]ny alien who is physically present in the United \nStates or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated port of arrival . . . ), \nirrespective of such alien’s status,” may apply for asylum.  8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  To qualify for \nasylum, a noncitizen must show a “well-founded fear of persecution” on account of a protected \nground, such as race, nationality, political opinion, or religion.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 11 of 22\n42.  Second, Congress has barred the removal of an individual to a country where it is \nmore likely than not that he would face persecution on one of these protected grounds.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3).  That protection implements this country’s obligations under the 1951 Refugee \nConvention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the Status of Refugees.  The relevant form of relief, \nknown as “withholding of removal,” requires the applicant to satisfy a higher standard with \nrespect to the likelihood of harm than asylum; granting that relief is mandatory if the standard is \nmet absent limited exceptions. \n43.  Third, the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) prohibits the government from \nreturning a noncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face torture.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note.  That protection implements the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), Pub. L. No. 105-277, div. G, Title XXII, § 2242.  As \nwith withholding of removal, CAT relief also requires the applicant to satisfy a higher standard \nwith respect to the likelihood of harm than asylum and relief is mandatory if that standard is met.  \nThere is no exception to CAT relief.  \nPresident Trump’s Proclamation Invoking the AEA \n44.  On March 14, the President signed the AEA Proclamation at issue here. It \nprovides that “all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA [Tren \nde Aragua], are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent \nresidents of the United States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as \nAlien Enemies.” See Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren de Aragua (Mar. 15, 2025).2   \n \n2 Available at: https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 12 of 22\n45.  Although the AEA calls for a “public proclamation,” 50 U.S.C. § 21, the \nadministration did not make the invocation public until around 3:53 p.m. EDT on March 15, \ndespite making extensive preparations to remove class members under the Act. \n46.  The Proclamation characterizes Tren de Aragua as a hybrid criminal state \nengaged in an invasion and predatory incursion into the United States as a basis to invoke the \nAEA. It also characterizes Tren de Aragua, a criminal organization, as a foreign nation or \ngovernment, and does not name Venezuela itself as the “foreign government” as the target of the \nAEA invocation. \n47.  The Proclamation alleges that Tren de Aragua is perpetrating, attempting, and \nthreatening predatory incursions, hostile actions, and irregular warfare.  \n48.  Thus, the Proclamation states that all Venezuelan citizens ages fourteen or older \nalleged to be members of Tren de Aragua—and who are not U.S. citizens or lawful permanent \nresidents—are alien enemies.  \n49.  Respondents have enacted a program to implement unlawful removals under the \nProclamation (“AEA Process”). The AEA Process provides no means or process for individuals \nto contest that they are members of the TdA and do not therefore fall within the terms of the \nProclamation. Nor does it provide individuals with the statutory grace period in which they can \nboth seek judicial review or arrange their affairs and leave voluntarily. \n50.  Instead, the Proclamation invokes the statutory exception to the “reasonable \nnotice” requirement by claiming that the individuals subject to the Proclamation are “chargeable \nwith actual hostility,” and pose “a public safety risk,” making them subject to immediate \napprehension, restraint, and removal. \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 13 of 22\n51.  Upon information and belief, the government employs a standardized check list, \n“Alien Enemy Validation Guide,” to determine who is an “alien enemy” subject to the \nProclamation. An ICE officer completes the form, tallying points for different categories of \nalleged TdA membership characteristics. However, the methodology that Respondents employs \nfor TdA membership relies heavily on physical attributes like tattoos, hand gestures, symbols, \nlogos, graffiti, and manner of dress. Experts who study the TdA have explained how none of \nthese physical attributes are reliable ways of identifying gang members.    \n52.  Upon information and belief, after signing the checklist document, the noncitizen \nis subject to removal to any location as may be directed but consistent with applicable laws.  \n53.  Noncitizens subject to the Proclamation are not afforded credible fear interviews \nfor asylum, nor will claims for protection under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) be \nrecognized. \n54.  As multiple judges sitting in a preliminary posture have already found, the AEA \nProcess is unlawful.  \n55.  First, the Proclamation does not satisfy the statutory requirements for proper \ninvocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Tren de Agua, a criminal organization, is not a nation or \nforeign government and is not part of the Venezuelan government, nor does it receive support \nfrom the government.  The United States is not in a declared war with Venezuela.  The United \nStates cannot declare war against Tren de Aragua because it is not a nation.  And neither \nVenezuela nor Tren de Aragua have invaded or threatened to invade the United States, nor has \neither engaged in a “predatory incursion” within the meaning of the AEA. \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 14 of 22\n56.  Moreover, there is no process, notice or meaningful opportunity for individuals to \nchallenge their designation as alien enemies. There is a significant risk that even individuals who \ndo not fall under the terms of the Proclamation will be subject to it.  \n57.  Lastly, it violates the process and protections that Congress has prescribed \nelsewhere in the country’s immigration laws for the removal of noncitizens. \n58.  As a result, countless Venezuelans—including Petitioners in this district and \nmany others in untold jurisdictions throughout the country—are at imminent risk of deportation \nwithout any hearing or meaningful review, regardless of their ties to the United States or the \navailability of claims for relief from and defenses to removal.  \n59.  Respondents seek to move Petitioners in secret, without due process, to a prison \nin El Salvador known for dire conditions, torture, and other forms of physical abuse—possibly \nfor life. This has already borne out for over 130 individuals on March 15 who have lost all \ncontact with their attorneys, family, and the world.  \nCLASS ALLEGATIONS \n60.  Petitioners bring this action under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a) and \n23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and a class of all other persons similarly situated. \n61.  Petitioners seek to represent the following Proposed Class: All noncitizens in \nimmigration custody who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential \nProclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United \nStates by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation. \n62.  The proposed class satisfies the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because the class is \nso numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Thousands from Venezuela will \npotentially be subjected to summary removal under the Proclamation and its implementation by \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 15 of 22\nRespondents.  The proposed class also includes numerous future noncitizens who will enter the \nUnited States and will be subjected to the Proclamation. \n63.  The class satisfies the commonality requirements of Rule 23(a)(2).  The members \nof the class are subject to a common practice: summary removal under the Proclamation contrary \nto the AEA, the INA, and the statutory protections Congress has enacted.  The suit also raises \nquestions of law common to members of the proposed class, including whether the Proclamation \nand its implementation violate the AEA, the INA, and the statutory protections for asylum \nseekers. \n64.  The proposed class satisfies the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3), because \nthe claims of the representative Petitioners are typical of the claims of the class.  Each proposed \nclass member, including the proposed class representatives, has experienced or faces the same \nprincipal injury (unlawful removal), based on the same government practice (the Proclamation \nand its implementation), which is unlawful as to the entire class because it violates the AEA, the \nINA, and due process. \n65.  The proposed class satisfies the adequacy requirements of Rule 23(a)(4).  The \nrepresentative Petitioners seek the same relief as the other members of the class—among other \nthings, an order declaring the Proclamation unlawful and an injunction preventing enforcement \nof the Proclamation.  In defending their rights, Petitioners will defend the rights of all proposed \nclass members fairly and adequately. \n66.  The proposed class is represented by experienced attorneys from the American \nCivil Liberties Union.  Proposed Class Counsel have extensive experience litigating class action \nlawsuits and other complex systemic cases in federal court on behalf of noncitizens. \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 16 of 22\n67.  The proposed class also satisfies Rule 23(b)(2).  Respondents have acted (or will \nact) on grounds generally applicable to the class by subjecting them to summary removal under \nthe Proclamation rather than affording them the protection of immigration laws.  Injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief is therefore appropriate with respect to the class as a whole. \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 21, et seq. \n(All Respondents) \n \n68.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n69.  The AEA does not authorize the removal of noncitizens from the United States \nabsent a “declared war” or a “perpetrated, attempted, or threatened” “invasion or predatory \nincursion” into the United States by a “foreign nation or government.”  See 50 U.S.C. § 21.  The \nProclamation on its face mandates Petitioners’ removal under the AEA where those \npreconditions have not been met.   \n70.  The AEA Process, which was purportedly established pursuant to the authority of \n50 U.S.C. § 21, is not authorized by that law. \n71.  The AEA (Section 21) permits removal only where noncitizens alleged to be \n“alien enemies” “refuse or neglect to depart” from the United States. 50 U.S.C. § 21. The AEA \n(Section 22) also requires the government to afford noncitizens alleged to be “alien enemies” \nsufficient time to settle their affairs and to depart the United States. See 50 U.S.C. § 22. \n72.  However, Petitioners are being subject to forced removal without being afforded \nthe privilege of voluntary departure, let alone any notice or an opportunity to respond to the \ndesignation of alien enemy. \n15 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 17 of 22\n73.  The application of the AEA Process to Petitioners is therefore ultra vires.  See 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq. \n(All Respondents) \n \n74.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n75.  The INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., sets out the sole mechanisms established by \nCongress for the removal of noncitizens.  \n76.  The INA provides that a removal proceeding before an immigration judge under 8 \nU.S.C. § 1229a is “the sole and exclusive procedure” by which the government may determine \nwhether to remove an individual, “[u]nless otherwise specified” in the INA.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229a(a)(3).   \n77.  The AEA Process creates an alternative removal mechanism outside of the \nimmigration laws set forth by Congress in Title 8. \n78.  The INA’s “exclusive procedure” and statutory protections apply to any removal \nof a noncitizen from the United States, including removals authorized by the AEA.  Because the \nAEA Process provides for the removal of Petitioners without the procedures specified in the \nINA, it violates 8 U.S.C. § 1229a and the INA. \n79.  As a result, the application of the AEA to Petitioners, which will result in their \nremoval from the United States, is contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n80.  In addition, by refusing to grant Petitioners access to the procedures specified in \nthe INA, Respondents have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \n16 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 18 of 22\nTHIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1158, Asylum \n(All Respondents) \n \n81.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n82.  The INA provides, with certain exceptions, that “[a]ny alien who is physically \npresent in the United States or who arrives in the United States (whether or not at a designated \nport of arrival and including an alien who is brought to the United States after having been \ninterdicted in international or United States waters), irrespective of such alien’s status, may apply \nfor asylum in accordance with this section or, where applicable, section 1225(b) of this title.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  \n83.  Respondents’ application of the AEA Process to Petitioners prevents them from \napplying for asylum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), and is therefore contrary to law.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nFOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n   \nViolation of 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), Withholding of Removal \n(All Respondents) \n \n84.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n85.  The “withholding of removal” statute, INA § 241(b)(3), codified at 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(b)(3), bars the removal of noncitizens to a country where it is more likely than not that \nthey would face persecution.  \n86.  Respondents’ AEA Process violates the withholding of removal statute because it \ndoes not provide adequate safeguards to ensure that Petitioners are not returned to a country \n17 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 19 of 22\nwhere it is more likely than not that they would face persecution.  As a result, Respondents’ \nactions against Petitioners are contrary to law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n87.  In addition, by refusing to grant Petitioners the procedural protections to which \nthey are entitled, Respondents have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the \nstatute.  5 U.S.C. § 706(1).   \nFIFTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n \nViolation of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”), \ncodified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 note \n(All Respondents) \n \n88.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n89.  FARRA prohibits the government from returning a noncitizen to a country where \nit is more likely than not that he would face torture. \n90.  Respondents’ AEA Process violates FARRA because it does not provide adequate \nsafeguards to ensure that Petitioners are not returned to a country where it is more likely than not \nthat they would face torture.  As a result, Respondents’ actions against Petitioners are contrary to \nlaw.  See 5 U.S.C. § 702(2)(A).  \n91.  In addition, by refusing to grant Petitioners the procedures to which they are \nentitled, Respondents have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute.  \n5 U.S.C. § 706(1). \nSIXTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nUltra Vires, Violation of 50 U.S.C. § 22  \n(All Respondents) \n \n92.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n18 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 20 of 22\n93.  The AEA requires that noncitizens whose removal is authorized by the AEA, \nunless “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against the public safety,” be allowed the \nfull time stipulated by treaty to depart or a reasonable time in which to settle their affairs before \ndeparting.  See 50 U.S.C. § 22.  The Proclamation on its face denies Petitioners any time under \nSection 22 to settle their affairs, because it declares everyone subject to the Proclamation to be \n“chargeable with actual hostility” and to be a “danger to public safety.”   \n94.  The AEA Process thus contravenes 50 U.S.C. § 22 and is ultra vires. \n95.  The application of the AEA Process to Petitioners is contrary to law.   \nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Due Process Under the Fifth Amendment \n(All Respondents) \n \n96.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n97.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides in relevant part that: \n“No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. \nConst. amend. V.  \n98.  In denying Petitioners meaningful procedural protections to challenge their \nremoval, the Proclamation violates due process.  \n99.  The Proclamation on its face also denies Petitioners any time to settle their affairs \nbefore departing and thus violates due process.   \nEIGHTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF \nViolation of Habeas Corpus \n(All Respondents) \n \n19 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 21 of 22\n100.  Detainees have the right to file petitions for habeas corpus to challenge the \nlegality of their detention or raise other claims related to their detention or to the basis for their \nremoval.  \n101.  The detention of Petitioners under the Alien Enemies Act has violated and \ncontinues to violate their right to habeas corpus. See U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 2 (Suspension \nClause); 28 U.S.C. § 2241.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully pray this Court to: \na.  Assume jurisdiction over this matter; \nb.  Certify this action as a class action on behalf of the proposed Petitioner Class, appoint the \nPetitioners as class representatives, and appoint the undersigned counsel as class counsel; \nc.  Grant a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo pending further \nproceedings; \nd.  Enjoin Respondents from transferring Petitioners out of this district during the pendency \nof this litigation; \ne.  Grant a writ of habeas corpus to Petitioners that enjoins Defendants from removing them \npursuant to the Proclamation; \nf.  Enjoin Respondents from removing Petitioners pursuant to the Proclamation; \ng.  Declare unlawful the Proclamation; \nh.

See \nInvocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de \nAragua (Mar. 15, 2025)1 (“Proclamation”).  The evening of March 15, Petitioners, on behalf of a \nprovisionally certified nationwide class, secured a court order from the District Court for the \nDistrict  of  Columbia  temporarily  pausing  removals  under  the  Proclamation,  though  the \n \n1 https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 2 of 29\ngovernment continued to remove at least two flights of people pursuant to the AEA.  That order \nwas immediately appealed by the government, but the court of appeals denied a stay.  On April 7, \n2025, the Supreme Court granted the government’s application to stay the order on the basis that \nPetitioners had to proceed through habeas in this District.  This case followed.   \nAs several judges have already found, Petitioners are likely to succeed in the merits of \ntheir challenge and are at imminent risk of removal to El Salvador, where they face potentially \npermanent sentence in a notorious prison.  Numerous accounts, both in declarations and public \nnews reporting have raised serious questions about the validity of the government’s designations \nof people as “alien enemies,” with no process provided for anyone to contest those designations.  \nA Temporary Restraining Order is needed because there may not be sufficient time for this Court \nto intervene before people are put on planes to remove Petitioners from the United States.  \nPetitioners also seek an injunction preventing their transfer out of this District while \nthe litigation is pending to preserve the Court’s jurisdiction. As already demonstrated, in their \nrush to transfer individuals to stage AEA removals, the government has mistakenly deported at \nleast one individual without legal basis. See Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1345, 2025 WL \n1021113, at *6 (4th Cir. Apr. 7, 2025) (Wilkinson, J., concurring) (noting “government conceding \nthat it made an error in deporting the plaintiff to a foreign country for which he was not eligible \nfor removal”). Any error would be just as devastating to Petitioners.  \nAs multiple judges have noted, there is likely no authority for the government’s actions. \nThe United States is not at war, and the prerequisites for invocation of the AEA have not been met. \nSee 50 U.S.C. § 21. The President can invoke the AEA only in a state of “declared war,” or when \nan “invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of \nthe United States by any foreign nation or government.” Id. Not surprisingly, therefore, the Act \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 3 of 29\nhas been invoked only three times in our country’s history, all in declared wars: The War of 1812, \nWorld War I, and World War II.  \nThe Proclamation targets Venezuelan noncitizens whom the government accuses of being \npart of Tren de Aragua, a criminal gang. But the Proclamation is invalid under the AEA for several \nreasons. First, Tren de Aragua is not a “foreign nation or government.” Second, Tren de Aragua is \nnot engaged in an “invasion” or “predatory incursions” within the meaning of the AEA, because \ncriminal activity does not meet the longstanding definitions of those statutory requirements—and \nhas never been a sufficient basis for the executive to cast foreign nationals as “alien enemies” \nsubject to arrest, internment, and removal. As a result, the government’s attempt to summarily \nremove Venezuelan noncitizens exceeds the wartime authority that Congress delegated in the AEA. \nMoreover,  the  government  has  provided  no  process,  notice  or  meaningful  opportunity  for \nindividuals to challenge their designation as alien enemies, contrary to the AEA and due process.  \nSee Trump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 102409, at *2 (Apr. 7, 2025) (requiring notice “within \na reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek” relief from summary \nremovals).  Lastly, the removals using the AEA violate the process and protections that Congress \nhas prescribed elsewhere in the country’s immigration laws for the removal of noncitizens. \nAccordingly,  Petitioners  move  the  Court  for  a  Temporary  Restraining  Order \n(“TRO”) barring their summary removal under the AEA and barring Respondents from \nrelocating them outside of the Southern District of New York.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 4 of 29\nLEGAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n \nI.  The Alien Enemies Act \n \nThe AEA is a wartime authority that grants the President specific powers with respect to \nthe regulation, detention, and deportation of enemy aliens. Passed in 1798 in anticipation of a war \nwith France, the AEA, as codified today, provides: \nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any foreign nation \nor government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or \nthreatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or \ngovernment, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, all natives, \ncitizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, being of the age \nof fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United States and not actually \nnaturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as \nalien enemies. \n \n50 U.S.C. § 21.  \nThis Act has only ever been used three times in the country’s history and each time in a \nperiod of war. During the War of 1812, President Madison required British subjects to register \nwith federal officials and relocate away from the eastern seaboard. See Lockington v. Smith, 15 F. \nCas. 758 (D. Ct. Penn. 1817). President Wilson invoked the Act against Germany and Austria-\nHungary during World War I to regulate and detain Germans and Austro-Hungarians living in the \nUnited States. And during World War II, President Roosevelt invoked the AEA against Japan, \nGermany, Italy, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.  \nThe Act provides that, generally, individuals designated as enemy aliens will have time to \n“settle affairs” before removal and the option to voluntarily “depart.”2 See, e.g., United States ex \n \n2 50 U.S.C. § 21 (providing for removal of only those “alien enemies” who “refuse or neglect to \ndepart” from the United States); id. § 22 (providing for “departure, the full time which is or shall \nbe stipulated by any treaty then in force between the United States and the hostile nation or \ngovernment of which he is a native citizen, denizen, or subject; and where no such treaty exists, \nor is in force, the President may ascertain and declare such reasonable time as may be consistent \nwith the public safety, and according to the dictates of humanity and national hospitality”). \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 5 of 29\nrel. Dorfler v. Watkins, 171 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1948) (“An alien must be afforded the privilege \nof voluntary departure before the Attorney General can lawfully remove him against his will.”). \nII.  Congress’s Comprehensive Reform of Immigration Law \nFollowing World War II, Congress consolidated U.S. immigration laws into a single text \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 (“INA”). The INA, and its subsequent \namendments, provide for a comprehensive system of procedures that the government must follow \nbefore removing a noncitizen from the United States. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3) (the INA provides \nthe “sole and exclusive procedure” for determining whether a noncitizen may be removed from \nthe United States).  \nAs part of that reform and other subsequent amendments, Congress prescribed safeguards \nfor noncitizens seeking protection from persecution and torture. These protections codify the \nhumanitarian framework adopted by the United Nations in response to the humanitarian failures \nof World War II. See INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S, 421, 439-40 (1987) (describing the United \nStates’ adoption of the United Nations’ post-war refugee protections). One of Congress’s “primary \npurposes” was “to bring United States refugee law into conformance” with international refugee \ntreaties and the bedrock principle that individuals may not be returned to countries where they face \npersecution or torture. Id. at 436. As the Second Circuit has recognized, “[i]t is no accident that \nmany of our asylum laws sprang forth as a result of events in 1930s Europe.” Aliyev v. Mukasey, \n549 F.3d 111, 118 n.8 (2d Cir. 2008).  \nFirst, the asylum statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1158, provides that any noncitizen in the United States \nhas a right to apply for asylum. See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  Second, the withholding of removal \nstatute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3), provides that noncitizens “may not” be removed to a country where \ntheir “life or freedom” would be threatened based on a protected ground. A grant of withholding \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 6 of 29\nis mandatory if the individual meets the statutory criteria. INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, \n420 (1999).  Third, protections under the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”) prohibit returning \nnoncitizens to a country where it is more likely than not that they would face torture. See Foreign \nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (“FARRA”) § 2242(a), Pub. L. No. 105-207, Div. \nG.  Title  XXI,  112  Stat.  2681  (codified  at  8  U.S.C.  §  1231  note);  8  C.F.R.  § 1208.16-.18 \n(implementing regulations).  \nIII.  The AEA Proclamation and the Unlawful Removals \nOn March 14, the President signed the AEA Proclamation at issue here. It provides that \n“all Venezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of TdA [Tren de Aragua], are \nwithin the United States, and are not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the \nUnited States are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies.” \nSee Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren de \nAragua (Mar. 15, 2025).3 Although the AEA calls for a “public proclamation,” 50 U.S.C. § 21, the \nadministration did not make the invocation public until around 3:53 p.m. EDT on March 15, \ndespite making extensive preparations to remove class members under the Act. J.G.G. v. Trump, \nNo. 1:25-cv-766-JEB (D.D.C. Mar. 18, 2025), ECF No. 28-1 (Cerna Decl.) ¶ 5; see generally id. \nat ECF No. 1 (Complaint). \nAnd the Proclamation does not provide any process for individuals to contest that they are \nmembers of the TdA and do not therefore fall within the terms of the Proclamation. Nor does it \nprovide individuals with the statutory grace period in which they can both seek judicial review or \narrange  their  affairs  and  leave  voluntarily.  Instead,  the  Proclamation  invokes  the  statutory \nexception to the “reasonable notice” requirement by claiming that all the individuals subject to the \n \n3 https://perma.cc/ZS8M-ZQHJ. \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 7 of 29\nProclamation are “chargeable with actual hostility,” and pose “a public safety risk”—despite the \nfact that there is no evidence of the sort of “hostility” that the Act requires, e.g., skirmishes with \nU.S. forces, nor any public safety risk because the men can be securely confined. See infra; 50 \nU.S.C.  §  22.  The  Proclamation  also  claims  to  supplant  the  removal  process  under  the \ncongressionally enacted immigration laws, which, among other things, provide a right to seek \nprotection from persecution and torture. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158, 1231(b)(3); 1231 note.  \nTo implement the Proclamation, in early March, the government began moving people who \nwere already detained with upcoming immigration proceedings from ICE detention facilities \naround the country, causing confusion and disruption to court hearings where individuals were \nseeking asylum and other humanitarian protections. See J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5067, 2025 WL \n914682, at *17 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Millett, J., concurring); J.G.G., 2025 WL 890401, at *3. \nThey were taken to detention centers in Texas, where detention officials began to tell the men they \nwere to be immediately removed from the country. See J.G.G., 2025 WL 890401, at *3. \nOn March 15, by the time the secret Proclamation was made public, these men, two of \nwhom are the named Petitioners here, had been shackled and driven to an airport and told they \nwould get on a plane, despite having no order permitting ICE to remove them and facing grave \ndanger even if they were removed to their home country of Venezuela. Id. \nFortunately, named  Petitioners’ immigration  counsel were able to get in touch with \nundersigned counsel, who mobilized quickly and filed a class action complaint and habeas in the \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia. Id. A TRO for the named Petitioners and others issued \nthe morning of March 15, leading Petitioners to be pulled off the planes and, eventually, brought \nback to the El Valle Detention Facility in Texas. Id. Although the D.C. district court granted a \nTRO against removal for the provisionally certified class in the evening of March 15, the \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 8 of 29\ngovernment deported several planefuls of people, many of whom did not have final orders and \nwere still pursuing asylum and humanitarian protections.  Id. at *5. \nFor expediency, this motion incorporates by reference the facts found by Judge Boasberg \nin his order denying the government’s motion to vacate the classwide TRO and the D.C. Circuit’s \npanel opinions on the government’s application for a stay of the TROs.  J.G.G., 2025 WL 890401, \nat *3-5; J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *2 (Henderson, J., concurring); id. at *16-19 (Millet, J., \nconcurring). \nTo  summarize: Well over one hundred people without final orders were summarily \nremoved to El Salvador the evening of March 15 pursuant to the Proclamation. See J.G.G., 2025 \nWL 890401, at *3; see also Statement from the White House Press Secretary (Mar. 18, 2025)4 \n(describing Proclamation and stating that “nearly 300” people were removed). This included a \nSalvadoran man who has been granted withholding of removal and whom the government freely \nadmits to have been removed by mistake. See Abrego Garcia, 2025 WL 1021113, at *6; see also \nAbrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 8:25-cv-951, ECF No. 11-3 ¶¶ 11–15 (D. Md. Mar. 31, 2025); id. \nECF No. 12-1, at *8 (Apr. 1, 2025).  \nNeither  J.G.O.  nor  G.F.F  has  had an  opportunity to  dispute the  government’s  gang \nallegations. See Trump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, at *4 (U.S. Apr. 2, 2025).  \nNeither received advanced notice of the basis for their removal. Exh. A (Carney Decl.) ¶ 19; Exh. \nB (Shealy Decl.) ¶ 19.  They were never given any paperwork.  Exh. A (Carney Decl.) ¶ 19; Exh. \nB (Shealy Decl.) ¶ 19.  Indeed, no government officers bothered to inform them that the plane they \nwere boarding was headed to El Salvador. Exh. A (Carney Decl.) ¶ 19; Exh. B (Shealy Decl.) ¶ \n19.   \n \n4 https://perma.cc/5UMH-JDVA. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 9 of 29\nThe government has suggested it provides individuals with notice of their status as alien \nenemies.  See Reply in Support of Application to Vacate, Trump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL \n1024097, at *8 (U.S. Apr. 2, 2025).   But, upon information and belief, that form asserts the men \nare alien enemies and pointedly states that they are “not entitled to a hearing, appeal, or judicial \nreview of this notice and warrant of apprehension and removal.”  J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, \nECF No. 67-21 (Sarabia Decl., Exh. 1) (AEA Validation Guide and Notice). Moreover, Petitioners \nand other members of the previously provisionally certified class received no such notice. Their \nimmigration attorneys were never informed or notified of their impending deportation or the basis \nfor the removal. See, e.g., id. at ECF No. 67-14 (Thierry Decl.) ¶ 9; id. at ECF No. 67-15 (Caro-\nCruz Decl.) ¶ 14; id. at 67-9 (Smyth Decl.) ¶ 6; see also J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097, at *6 (“when \nthe District Court issued its temporary restraining order on March 15, 2025, the Government was \nengaged in a covert operation to deport dozens of immigrants without notice or an opportunity for \nhearings”) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting). \nWhether most (or perhaps all) of the class members lack ties to TdA remains to be seen, \nbecause the government secretly rushed the men out of the country and has provided Petitioners \nwith no information about the class. But evidence since the flights on March 15 increasingly shows \nthat many class members removed to El Salvador are not “members” of TdA as is required to fall \nwithin the Proclamation; many have no ties to TdA at all. See J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, ECF \nNo. 67-21 (Sarabia Decl., Exhs. 4-20) (media and other reports regarding evidence contradicting \ngang allegations). These false accusations are particularly devastating here, where Petitioners have \nstrong claims for relief under our immigration laws. Exh. A (Carney Decl.) ¶ 3; Exh.

J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, \nECF No. 67-21 (Sarabia Decl., Exh. 1). The government’s methodology relies heavily on physical \nattributes like “tattoos denoting membership/loyalty to TDA” and hand gestures, symbols, logos, \ngraffiti, or manner of dress.

Id. at ECF No. 67-21 (Sarabia Decl., Exh. 1).  \nExperts who have spent over a decade studying policing, violence, migration, prisons, \nand organized crime in Venezuela—and TdA in particular—have provided accurate, \ncomprehensive picture of TdA and its activities. See generally J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, \nECF Nos. 67-3 (Hanson Decl.), 67-4 (Antillano Decl.), 67-12 (Dudley Decl.).

Petitioners Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits. \n \nA.  The Proclamation Does Not Satisfy the AEA. \n \nThe Proclamation is unprecedented, exceeding the President’s statutory authority in three \ncritical respects: there is no invasion or predatory incursion; no foreign government or nation; \nand no process to contest whether an individual falls within the Proclamation.  When the \ngovernment asserts “an unheralded power” in a “long-extant statute,” courts “greet its \nannouncement with a measure of skepticism.”  Util. Air Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 \n(2014). That skepticism is well warranted here. \n1.  There Is No “Invasion” or “Predatory Incursion” upon the United States. \n \nThe Proclamation fails on an essential statutory requirement: that there be an “invasion or \npredatory incursion” directed “against the territory of the United States.”  The text and history of \nthe Alien Enemies Act make clear that it uses these terms to refer to military actions that are \nindicative of an actual or impending war.  At the time of enactment, an “invasion” was a large-\nscale military action by an army intent on territorial conquest.  See Webster’s Dictionary, Invasion \n(1828) (“invasion” is a “hostile entrance into the possession of another; particularly, the entrance \nof a hostile army into a country for purpose of conquest or plunder, or the attack of a military \nforce”); Johnson’s Dictionary, Invasion (1773) (“invasion” is a “[h]ostile entrance upon the right \nor possession of another; hostile encroachment” such as when “William the Conqueror invaded \nEngland”);  see  also  J.G.G.,  2025  WL  914682,  at  *20  (Henderson,  J.,  concurring)  (in  the \nConstitution, “invasion” “is used in a military sense” “in every instance”).  And “predatory \nincursion” referred to smaller-scale military raids aimed to destroy military structures or supplies, \nor to otherwise sabotage the enemy, often as a precursor to invasion and war.  See Webster’s \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 14 of 29\nDictionary, Predatory (1828) (“predatory” underscores that the purpose of a military party’s \n“incursion” was “plundering” or “pillaging”); id., Incursion (1828) (“incursion . . . applies to the \nexpeditions of small parties or detachments of an enemy’s army, entering a territory for attack, \nplunder, or destruction of a post or magazine”); J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *10 (Henderson, J., \nconcurring) (early American caselaw indicates that “predatory incursion” is “a form of hostilities \nagainst the United States by another nation-state, a form of attack short of war”).  \nThe historical context in which the AEA was passed reinforces what Congress meant by \n“predatory incursion” and “invasion.”  At the time of passage, French ships were already attacking \nU.S. merchant ships in U.S.   See, e.g., 7 Annals of Cong. 58 (May 1797) (promoting creation of \na Navy to “diminish the probability of . . . predatory incursions” by French ships while recognizing \nthat distance from Europe lessened the chance of “invasion”); Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 68, 1 Stat. \n578, 578 (authorizing US ships to seize “any armed French vessel” “found within the jurisdictional \nlimits of the United States”).  Congress worried that these attacks against the territory of the United \nStates were the precursor to all-out war with France.   J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *1 (Henderson, \nJ., concurring) (“In 1798, our fledgling Republic was consumed with fear . . . of external war with \nFrance.”).  This “predatory violence” by a sovereign nation led, in part, to the AEA.  See Act of \nJuly 7, 1798, ch. 67, 1 Stat. 578, 578 (“[W]hereas, under authority of the French government, there \nis yet pursued against the United States, a system of predatory violence”). \nAt the same time, the 1798 Congress was considering whether to authorize the President to \nraise troops to respond to impending conflict with France. It ultimately did so, authorizing him to \nraise troops “in the event of a declaration of war against the United States, or of an actual invasion \nof their territory, by a foreign power, or of imminent danger of such invasion.”  Act of May 28, \n1798, ch. 47, 1 Stat. 558. As Judge Henderson noted in a previous iteration of this case, “[t]his \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 15 of 29\nlanguage bears more than a passing resemblance to the language of the AEA, which the Congress \nenacted a mere thirty-nine days later.  J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *9. As such, the historical \ncontext makes plain that Congress was concerned about military incursions by the armed forces of \na foreign nation.  \nThe interpretive canon of noscitur a sociis confirms that the AEA’s powers extended \nbeyond an existing war only when war was imminent.  Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 169 n.13 (explaining \nthat “the life of [the AEA] is defined by the existence of a war”).  The three terms “declared war,” \n“invasion,” and “predatory incursion” appear alongside each other in a related list.  Reading the \nlatter two in light of the company they keep highlights the express military nature of their usage \nhere.  See Jarecki v. G.D. Searle & Co., 367 U.S. 303, 307 (1961). \nAn “invasion” or “predatory incursion” are thus military actions by foreign governments \nthat constitute or imminently precede acts of war.  “Mass illegal migration” or criminal activities, \nas described in the Proclamation, plainly do not fall within the statutory boundaries.  On its face, \nthe Proclamation makes no findings that TdA is acting as an army or military force.  Nor does the \nProclamation assert that TdA is acting with an intent to gain a territorial foothold in the United \nStates for military purposes.  And the Proclamation makes no suggestion that the United States \nwill imminently be at war with Venezuela.  The oblique references to the TdA’s ongoing “irregular \nwarfare” within the United States does not suffice because the Proclamation makes clear that it \nrefers to “mass illegal migration” and “crimes”—neither of which constitute war within the \nFounding Era understanding.  It asserts that TdA “commits brutal crimes” with the goal of \n“harming United States citizens, undermining public safety, and . . . destabilizing democratic \nnations.”   But these actions are simply not “against the territory” of the United States.  Indeed, if \nmass migration or criminal activities by some members of a particular nationality could qualify as \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 16 of 29\nan “invasion,” then virtually any group, hailing from virtually any country, could be deemed \nenemy aliens. \n2.  The Purported Invasion Is Not by a “Foreign Nation or Government.” \n \nThe Proclamation fails to assert that any “foreign nation or government” within the \nmeaning of the Act is invading the United States.  Put simply, the Proclamation never finds that \nTdA is a foreign “nation” or “government.”   Instead, the Proclamation asserts that “[o]ver the \nyears,” the Venezuelan government has “ceded ever-greater control over their territories to \ntransnational criminal organizations.”  But the Proclamation notably does not say that TdA \noperates as a government in those regions7  In fact, the Proclamation does not even specify that \nTdA currently controls any territory in Venezuela.  \nThe AEA presumes that a designated nation possesses treaty-making powers.  See 50 U.S.C. \n§ 22 (“stipulated by any treaty . . . between the United States and the hostile nation or government”).  \nNations—not criminal organizations—are the entities that enter into treaties.  See, e.g., Medellin \nv. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 505, 508 (2008) (treaty is “a compact between independent nations” and \n“agreement among sovereign powers”); Holmes v. Jennison, 39 U.S. 540, 570-72 (1840) (similar).  \nIt should go without saying that TdA possesses no such power. \nMoreover, when a “nation or government” is designated under the AEA, the statute unlocks \npower over that nation or government’s “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects.”  50 U.S.C. § 21.  \nCountries have “natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects.”  By contrast, criminal organizations, in \nthe government’s own view, have “members.” Proclamation § 1 (“members of TdA”).  And it \ndesignates TdA “members” as subject to AEA enforcement—but “members” are not “natives, \n \n7 Guantanamo Bay provides an analogy.  There, the United States controls the naval base on the \nisland.  But the United States’ control of a piece of land does not somehow render it the \n“government” of Cuba.  \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 17 of 29\ncitizens,  denizens,  or  subjects.”    That  glaring  mismatch  underscores  that  Respondents  are \nattempting not only to use the AEA in an unprecedented way, but in a way that Congress never \npermitted—as  a mechanism to  address, in the  government’s  own  words,  a  non-state actor.  \nVenezuela has natives, citizens, and subjects, but TdA (not Venezuela) is designated under the \nproclamation.  No amount of wordplay can avoid the obvious fact that Venezuela is the relevant \ncountry for statutory purposes here—and TdA is a non-state criminal organization. \nEven as the Proclamation singles out certain Venezuelan nationals, it does not claim that \nVenezuela is invading the United States.  And, as the President’s own CIA Director recently \ntestified, the intelligence community has no assessment that says the US is at war with or being \ninvaded by Venezuela.  Ryan Goodman, Bluesky (Mar. 26, 2025).8  The AEA requires the \nPresident to identify a “foreign nation or government” that is invading or engaging in an invasion \nor incursion.  Because it does not, the Proclamation fails on its face.    \nInstead, the Proclamation makes a half-hearted attempt to link TdA to Venezuela by \nsuggesting that TdA is “supporting,” “closely aligned with,” or “has infiltrated” the Maduro regime.  \nSee Proclamation.  But experts are in accord that it is “absolutely implausible that the Maduro \nregime controls TdA or that the Maduro government and TdA are intertwined.”  Id. at 67-3 \n(Hanson Decl.) ¶17; id. at 67-4 (Antillano Decl.) ¶ 13; id. at 67-12 (Dudley Decl.) ¶¶ 2, 21.  As \none expert who has done numerous projects for the U.S. government, including on the topic of \nTdA, explained, the Proclamation’s characterization of the relationship between the Venezuelan \nstate and TdA with respect to TdA’s activities in the United States is “simply incorrect.”  Id. at 67-\n \n8 https://bsky.app/profile/rgoodlaw.bsky.social/post/3llc4wzbkr22k  (Q:  “Does  the  intelligence \ncommunity assess that we are currently at war or being invaded by the nation of Venezuela?” A: \n“We  have  no  assessment  that  says  that.”);  also  available  at  https://www.c-\nspan.org/program/house-committee/national-security-and-intelligence-officials-testify-on-global-\nthreats/657380. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 18 of 29\n12 (Dudley Decl.) ¶¶ 5, 17-18.  The President’s own intelligence agencies reached that same \nconclusion prior to his invocation of the AEA.  See id. at 67-21 (Sarabia Roman Decl., Exh. 19) \n(“shared  judgment  of the  nation’s  spy  agencies”  is “that  [TdA]  was  not  controlled  by the \nVenezuelan government”).  \nBut the AEA’s historical record confirms that it was intended to address conflicts with \nforeign sovereigns, not a criminal gang like TdA.  See 5 Annals of Cong. 1453 (Apr. 1798) (“[W]e \nmay very shortly be involved in war . . .”); John Lord O’Brian, Special Ass’t to the Att’y Gen. for \nWar Work, N.Y. State Bar Ass’n Annual Meeting: Civil Liberty in War Time, at 8 (Jan. 17, 1919) \n(“The [AEA] was passed by Congress . . . at a time when it was supposed that war with France \nwas imminent.”); Jennifer K. Elsea & Matthew C. Weed, Cong. Rsch. Serv., RL3113, Declarations \nof War and Authorizations for the Use of Military Force 1 (2014) (Congress has never issued a \ndeclaration of war against a nonstate actor).  If Respondents were allowed to designate any group \nwith ties to officials as a foreign government, and courts were powerless to review that designation, \nany group could be deemed a government, leading to an untenable and overbroad application of \nthe AEA.  \n3.  Summary Removals Without Notice and a Meaningful Opportunity to \nChallenge “Alien Enemy” Designations Violate the AEA and Due \nProcess. \n \nThe government must provide Petitioners notice “within a reasonable time and in such a \nmanner as will allow them to actually seek” relief from summary removals under the Proclamation.  \nJ.G.G., 2025 WL 102409, at *2; id. (“detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are \nentitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal.”); see also J.G.G., 2025 WL \n914682, at *21 (Millett, J., concurring) (“the government agrees that individuals are entitled to \nchallenge in court whether they fall within the terms of the AEA or are otherwise not lawfully \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 19 of 29\nremovable under it.”).  The government’s concession that there must be an opportunity to contest \none’s designation as an enemy alien, Trump v. J.G.G., 2025 WL 102409, at *2, is well taken given \nthat Ludecke expressly recognized as much.  335 U.S. at 171 n.17; see also, e.g., Ex parte Gilroy, \n257 F. 110, 114-24 (S.D.N.Y. 1919); United States ex rel. Zdunic v. Uhl, 137 F.2d 858, 860 (2d \nCir. 1943); Bauer, 171 F.2d at 493-94. \nBecause the government is currently providing no notice, process, or opportunity to contest \na designation, the precise contours of such review need not be determined here.  At this stage, even \nassuming the Court finds that the AEA can be used at all against a “gang” during peacetime, the \nCourt need only hold that the current Proclamation is unlawful in failing to provide any process, \neven sufficient notice and opportunity to file the individual habeas petitions held out by the \ngovernment.  The AEA, per Ludecke, as well due process, requires that noncitizens alleged to be \nalien enemies receive notice of the factual basis for removal and a meaningful opportunity to rebut \nit.  See J.G.G., 2025 WL 102409, at *2 (“‘It is well established that the Fifth Amendment entitles \n[noncitizens] to due process of law’ in the context of removal proceedings.”) (quoting Reno v. \nFlores, 507 U. S. 292, 306 (1993)). \nFinally, even if Petitioners were properly designated alien enemies (which they were not), \nthe President may lawfully remove noncitizens under the AEA only when those designated \nnoncitizens “refuse or neglect to depart” from the United States voluntarily.  50 U.S.C. § 21.  \nIndeed, even during World War II, courts in this circuit interpreting the AEA consistently \nrecognized that “alien enemies” retained the right to voluntary departure.  See U.S. ex rel. Ludwig, \n164 F.2d at 457  (Section 21 establishes a “right of voluntary departure” that functions as a \n“statutory condition precedent” to the government’s right to deport enemy aliens); United States \nex rel. Dorfler v. Watkins, 171 F.2d 431, 432 (2d Cir. 1948) (“An alien must be afforded the \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 20 of 29\nprivilege of voluntary departure before the Attorney General can lawfully remove him against his \nwill.”). \nUnder Section 21, there is no exception to the general right of voluntary departure; it is a \n“statutory condition precedent” to removal.  U.S. ex rel. Ludwig, 164 F.2d at 457.  Section 22 \nestablishes separate rights concerning the particular conditions for departure, with an exception \nfor those “chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime against public safety.” 50 U.S.C. § 22.  \nHowever, that exception cannot be invoked categorically.  It instead requires individualized \nassessments—each noncitizen must specifically be “chargeable” with actual hostility or a crime \nagainst public safety to lose eligibility for the rights described in Section 22.  Respondents have \nmade no such individualized assessments here—much less provided any opportunity to contest \nsuch findings. \nB.  The Proclamation Violates the Specific Protections that Congress Established \nfor Noncitizens Seeking Humanitarian Protection.   \n \nThe Proclamation is unlawful for an additional, independent reason: it overrides statutory \nprotections for noncitizens seeking relief from torture by subjecting them to removal without \nmeaningful consideration of their claims.  Petitioners were not only barred from raising a torture \nclaim but also were effectively precluded from doing so because Respondents never informed \nthem of the country to which they would be removed—directly contravening protections enacted \nby Congress.  \nCongress enacted codified the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, \nInhuman,  or  Degrading  Treatment  or  Punishment  (“CAT”)  to  ensure  that  noncitizens  have \nmeaningful opportunities to seek protection from torture.  See Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act of 1998 § 2242(a), Pub. L. No. 105-277, Div. G. Title XXI,  112 Stat. 2681 \n(1998) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231 notes) (implementing CAT); C.F.R. §§ 208.16 to 208.18 \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 21 of 29\n(FARRA procedure).  CAT categorically prohibits returning a noncitizen to any country where \nthey would more likely than not face torture.  See 8 U.S.C. §1231 note.  These protections apply \nregardless of the mechanism for removal. \nThe  D.C.  Circuit  recently  addressed  a  similar  issue  in  Huisha-Huisha  v.  Mayorkas, \nreconciling the Executive’s authority under a public-health statute, 42 U.S.C. § 265, with CAT’s \nanti-torture protections.  27 F.4th 718.  The Court held that because § 265 was silent about where \nnoncitizens could be expelled, and CAT explicitly addressed that question, no conflict existed.  \nBoth statutes could—and therefore must—be given effect.  Id. at 721, 731-32 (citing Epic Sys. \nCorp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. 497, 510 (2018) (“When . . . confronted with two Acts of Congress \nallegedly touching on the same topic,” a court “must strive to give effect to both.”) (cleaned up)).  \nThis case is on all fours with Huisha-Huisha.  Because no genuine conflict exists between the AEA \nand  FARRA,  this  Court  correctly  harmonized  these  statutes  by  concluding  that  FARRA’s \nprotections apply to removals under the AEA. \nDespite this clear statutory framework, Respondents prevented both named Petitioners \nfrom asserting their rights under CAT (and undoubtedly have done the same to other members of \nthe class).  See Exh. A (Carney Decl.) ¶ 3 (describing threats on account of sexual orientation); \nExh. B (Shealy Decl.) ¶ 5 (describing fear of persecution for political activity).  Moreover, even if \nPetitioners had been permitted to apply, their opportunity would have been meaningless because \nRespondents deliberately withheld information about the country to which they were being \nremoved.   \nThe AEA can similarly be harmonized with other subsequently enacted statutes specifically \ndesigned to protect noncitizens seeking asylum and withholding.  See Refugee Act of 1980, Pub. \nL. No. 96-212, 94 Stat. 102 (1980) (asylum and withholding); 8 U.S.C. §§ 1158 (asylum), \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 22 of 29\n1231(b)(3) (withholding of removal).  Congress has unequivocally declared that “[a]ny alien who \nis physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States . . . irrespective of \nsuch alien’s status, may apply for asylum.” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1).  Similarly, the withholding of \nremoval explicitly bars returning a noncitizen to a country where their “life or freedom” would be \nthreatened based on a protected ground.  Id. § 1231(b)(3)(A).   \n“In understanding this statutory text, ‘a page of history is worth a volume of logic.’”  Jones \nv. Hendrix, 599 U.S. 465, 472 (2023) (quoting New York Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 \n(1921)).  These humanitarian protections were enacted in the aftermath of World War II, when the \nUnited States joined other countries in committing to never again turn our backs on people fleeing \npersecution and torture.  Sadako Ogata, U.N. High Comm’r for Refugees, Address at the Holocaust \nMemorial Museum (Apr. 30, 1997).9  A President invoking the AEA cannot simply sweep away \nthese protections. \nC.  The Proclamation Violates the Procedural Requirements of the INA \n \nSince the last invocation of the AEA more than eighty years ago, Congress has carefully \nspecified the procedures by which noncitizens may be removed from the United States.  And the \nINA leaves little doubt that its procedures must apply to every removal, unless otherwise specified \nby that statute.  It directs: “Unless otherwise specified in this chapter,” the INA’s comprehensive \nscheme provides “the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be \nadmitted to the United States, or if the alien has been so admitted, removed from the United States.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3); see also United States v. Tinoso, 327 F.3d 864, 867 (9th Cir. 2003) \n(“Deportation and removal must be achieved through the procedures provided in the INA.”). This \n \n9 https://perma.cc/X5YF-K6EU. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 23 of 29\nlanguage makes clear that Congress intended for the INA to “supersede all previous laws with \nregard to deportability.” S. Rep. No. 82-1137, at 30 (Jan. 29, 1952).10 \nCongress was aware that alien enemies were subject to removal in times of war or invasion \nwhen it enacted the INA. See Miles v. Apex Marine Corp., 498 U.S. 19, 32 (1990) (courts presume \nCongress drafts statutes with full knowledge of existing law).  Indeed, the AEA had been invoked \njust a few years before passage of the 1952 INA.  With this awareness, Congress provided that the \nINA contains the “sole and exclusive” procedures for deportation or removal and declined to carve \nout AEA removals as an exception from standard immigration procedures, even as it expressly \nprovided exceptions for other groups of noncitizens, including noncitizens who pose security risks. \nSee, e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(3) (excepting noncitizens in expedited removal proceedings from \nthe INA’s “sole and exclusive” provision); 8 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. (establishing fast-track \nproceedings for noncitizens posing national security risks). \nIgnoring the INA’s role as the “sole and exclusive” procedure for determining whether a \nnoncitizen may be removed, Respondents purport to bypass the mandated congressional scheme \nin order to formulate an entirely separate procedure for removal and usurp Congress’s Article I \npower in the process.  Accordingly, the Proclamation violates the INA by denying Petitioners the \nprocess due under that law. \nII.  The Administration’s Abuse of the Alien Enemies Act Has Caused and Will \nContinue to Cause Petitioners Irreparable Harm. \n \n \n10 One of the processes otherwise specified in the INA is the Alien Terrorist Removal Procedure \nat 8 U.S.C. § 1531 et seq. The Attorney General may opt to use these proceedings when he or she \nhas classified information that a noncitizen is an “alien terrorist.”  Id. § 1533(a)(1). But even that \nprocess requires notice, a public hearing, provision of counsel for indigents, the opportunity to \npresent evidence, and individualized review by an Article III judge. Id. §§ 1532(a), 1534(a)(2), (b), \n(c)(1)-(2). And the government bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, \nthat the noncitizen is subject to removal as an “alien terrorist.” Id. § 1534(g). \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 24 of 29\nIn the absence of preliminary relief, Petitioners can be summarily removed to places, such \nas El Salvador, where they face life-threatening conditions, persecution and torture.  See J.G.G., \n2025 WL 890401, at *33-35 (Boasberg, J.,) (“Needless to say, the risk of torture, beatings, and \neven death clearly and unequivocally supports a finding of irreparable harm.”).  And while removal \ndoes not by itself ordinarily constitute irreparable harm, Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), \nthese are hardly run-of-the-mill removals.  Petitioners’ removals constitute grave and immediate \nirreparable harm because of what awaits them in a Salvadoran prison.  See J.G.G., 2025 WL \n1024097, at *5 (U.S. Apr. 7, 2025) (“The record reflects that inmates in Salvadoran prisons are \nhighly likely to face immediate and intentional life-threatening harm at the hands of state actors.”) \n(citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Prison officials in El Salvador engage in \nwidespread physical abuse, including waterboarding, electric shocks, using implements of torture \non detainees’ fingers, forcing detainees into ice water for hours, and hitting or kicking detainees \nso severely that it causes broken bones or ruptured organs.  See supra.; see also Haitian Ctrs. \nCouncil, Inc. v. McNary, 969 F.2d 1326, 1339 (2d Cir. 1992) (“irreparable harm” where plaintiffs \n“may face torture” if they “are repatriated to Haiti”), vacated as moot 509 U.S. 918 (1993); Huisha-\nHuisha, 27 F.4th at 733 (irreparable harm exists where petitioners “expelled to places where they \nwill be persecuted or tortured”); Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 969 (9th Cir. 2011) (holding \nthat removal to a country where one faces harm constitutes irreparable injury).  And Petitioners \nmay never get out of these prisons. See J.G.G., 2025 WL 1024097, at *5 (Sotomayor, J., \ndissenting); see also supra, Nayib Bukele, X.com.  \nAnd even if the government instead removes Petitioners to Venezuela, they face serious \nharm there, too.  In fact, many petitioners fled Venezuela for the very purpose of escaping the \npersecution they faced in Venezuela and have pending asylum cases on that basis.  For example, \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 25 of 29\nG.F.F. has already suffered threats based on his sexuality and fears persecution if returned.  Exh. \nA (Carney Decl.) ¶ 3.  And returning to Venezuela labeled as a gang member by the United States \ngovernment only increases the danger, as they will face heightened scrutiny from Venezuela’s \nsecurity agency, and possibly even violence from rivals of TdA.  J.G.G., No. 1:25-cv-766-JEB, \nECF No. 67-3 (Hanson Decl.) ¶ 28. \nNot only do Petitioners face grave harm, thus far the government has tried to execute their \nremovals without any due process.  See Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 560 F. Supp. 3d 146, 172 \n(D.D.C. 2021) (finding irreparable harm where plaintiffs “face the threat of removal prior to \nreceiving  any  of  the  protections  the  immigration  laws  provide”);  P.J.E.S.  ex  rel.  Escobar \nFrancisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d 492, 517 (D.D.C. 2020) (irreparable injury exists where class \nmembers  were  “threatened  with  deportation  prior  to  receiving  any  of  the  protections  the \nimmigration laws provide”); see also supra (discussing the lack of notice and meaningful process).  \nAlthough the Supreme Court has made clear that meaningful notice is required under the AEA, \nJ.G.G.,  2025  WL  102409,  at  *2,  Respondents  have  yet  to  concede  that  they  will  provide \nmeaningful notice.  Cf. Mar. 24 Hearing Tr. 1:44:39-1:46-23, J.G.G. v. Trump, 25-5067 (D.C. Cir. \n2025) (“We take the position that the AEA does not require notice . . . [and] the government \nbelieves there would not be a limitation [on removal]” absent an injunction).  As such, there \nremains an unacceptably high risk that the government will deport class members who are not in \nfact members of TdA. \nIII.  The Balance of Equities and Public Interest Weigh Decidedly in Favor of a \nTemporary Restraining Order.  \n \nThe  balance  of  equities  and  the  public  interest  factors  merge  in  cases  against  the \ngovernment. See Nken, 556 U.S. at 4365.  Here, the balance of hardships overwhelmingly favors \nPetitioners.  The public has a critical interest in preventing wrongful removals to places where \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 26 of 29\nindividuals  will  face  persecution  and  torture.    Conversely,  the  government  can  make  no \ncomparable claim to harm from an injunction.  See J.G.G., 2025 WL 914682, at *29 (Millett, J., \nconcurring) (“the government’s preference for habeas proceedings would produce at least the same \nrestriction on the President’s authority to remove the Plaintiffs that the TROs impose.”); see also \nNken, 556 U.S. at 436 (describing the “public interest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully \nremoved, particularly to countries where they are likely to face substantial harm”);  Planned \nParenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018) (“It is evident that ‘[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of \nunlawful agency action.’”) (quoting League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016)); see also Make the Road N.Y. v. Pompeo, 475 F. Supp. 3d 232, 269 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (“It is \naxiomatic that the President must exercise his executive powers lawfully. When there are serious \nconcerns that the President has not done so, the public interest is best served by ‘curtailing unlawful \nexecutive action.’”) (quoting Hawaii v. Trump, 878 F.3d 662, 700 (9th Cir. 2017), rev’d and \nremanded on other grounds, 585 U.S. 667 (2018)).   \nPetitioners,  moreover,  do  not  contest  the  government’s  ability  to  prosecute  criminal \noffenses, detain noncitizens, and remove noncitizens under existing statutory guidelines. At \nbottom, law enforcement and immigration enforcement officials lose no authority or ability to \nlawfully detain such individuals, even if the AEA Proclamation is enjoined. See J.G.G., 2025 WL \n914682, at *30 (Millett, J., concurring) (“The Executive remains free to take TdA members off the \nstreets and keep them in detention. The Executive can also deport alleged members of TdA under \nthe INA in expedited fashion.”) \nIV.  The All Writs Act Confers Broad Power to Preserve the Integrity of Court \nProceedings. \n \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 27 of 29\nIn addition to this Court’s general equitable powers, this is a textbook case for use of the \nAll Writs Act (“AWA”), which provides federal courts with a powerful tool to preserve the \nintegrity of their jurisdiction to adjudicate claims before them. See 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). If \nPetitioners are illegally sent to a foreign country, and the foreign government assumes jurisdiction \nover the Petitioners, the Court will likely lose jurisdiction to remedy the unlawful use of the AEA. \nThe All Writs Act encompasses a federal court’s power to “maintain the status quo by \ninjunction pending review of an agency’s action through the prescribed statutory channels,” F.T.C. \nv. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 604 (1966), and courts have found that the Act should be broadly \nconstrued to “achieve all rational ends of law,” California v. M&P Investments, 46 F. App’x 876, \n878 (9th Cir. 2002) (quoting Adams v. United States, 317 U.S. 269, 273 (1942)). \nWhereas a traditional preliminary injunction requires a party to state a claim, an injunction \nbased on the AWA requires only that a party identify a threat to the integrity of an ongoing or \nprospective proceeding, or of a past order or judgment. Klay, 376 F.3d at 1097 (a court may enjoin \nalmost any conduct “which, left unchecked, would have . . . the practical effect of diminishing the \ncourt’s power to bring the litigation to a natural conclusion”); see also United States v. Int’l Bhd. \nof Teamsters, 266 F.3d 45, 50 (2d Cir. 2001) (“Act’s grant of authority is plainly broad”); Arctic \nZero, Inc. v. Aspen Hills, Inc., 2018 WL 2018115, at *5 (S.D. Cal. May 1, 2018) (distinguishing \nAWA injunction from traditional preliminary injunction). It is sufficient for the Court to find that \na party has identified a threat to the integrity of or “natural conclusion” of a federal case. \nCourts have explicitly relied upon the AWA in order to prevent even a risk that a \nrespondent’s actions will diminish the court’s capacity to adjudicate claims before it. See Michael \nv. INS, 48 F.3d 657, 664 (2d Cir. 1995) (using the AWA to stay an order of deportation “in order \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886     Document 2-1     Filed 04/08/25     Page 28 of 29\nto safeguard the court’s appellate jurisdiction” and preserve its ability to hear subsequent appeals \nby the petitioner). \nV.  The Court Should Not Require Petitioners to Provide Security Prior to the \nTemporary Restraining Order. \n \nThe court should not require a bond under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65.  The district \ncourt “is vested with wide discretion in the matter of security,” including the option “to require no \nbond.”  Dr.’s Assocs., Inc. v. Stuart, 85 F.3d 975, 985 (2d Cir. 1996); see also State Farm Mut. \nAutomobile Ins. Co. v. Tri-Borough NY Med. Practice P.C., 120 F.4th 59, 86 (2d Cir. 2024) \n(“Courts  have  the  discretion  .  .  .  to  require  no  security  at  all  depending  on  the  specific \ncircumstances.”).  District courts routinely exercise this discretion to require no security in cases \nbrought by indigent and/or incarcerated people, and in the vindication of immigrants’ rights. See, \ne.g.,  Bass  v.  Richardson,  338  F.  Supp.  478,  489–90  (S.D.N.Y.  1971)  (“indigents,  suing \nindividually or as class Petitioners, ordinarily should not be required to post a bond under Rule \n65(c).”) \nCONCLUSION \n  The Court should grant Petitioners’ motion for a temporary restraining order as to the \nnamed Petitioners and the class. \nDated: April 8, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n     \n  /s/ Daniel Galindo \nDaniel Galindo \nMy Khanh Ngo* \nLee Gelernt  \nNoelle Smith* \nAshley Gorski \nOscar Sarabia Roman* \nOmar C.

HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.: \n  Respondents move to decertify the Class of Petitioners. They claim that there are only \neight persons in the class Petitioners seek to represent—too few to satisfy the requirement of \nnumerosity under Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). The class, as amended, is defined as: \nAll noncitizens in federal, state, or local custody in the Southern District of New \nYork who were, are, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential \nProclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the \nInvasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua’ and/or its implementation, who \nhave not been given notice following the Supreme Court's decision of April 7, \n2025, Trump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, and granted a hearing. \n \nECF No. 34. Since the Class was properly certified, I deny Respondents’ motion.  \n  As I explained in my Opinion and Order of April 9, 2025, granting class certification, \nECF No. 32, the considerations of numerosity are broader than the sheer number of individuals \nin the class. See Robidoux v. Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1993) (reversing district \ncourt’s decision that numerosity was lacking since that determination “depends on all the \ncircumstances surrounding a case, not on mere numbers.”). Moreover, the Second Circuit has \nheld that class actions in habeas cases are not subject to the “precise provisions” of Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 23, the Rule which generally governs class action certification. United States ex rel. Sero v. \nPreiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125-26 (2d Cir. 1974).  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 83     Filed 05/06/25     Page 2 of 2\nHere, it is not known how many people in the jurisdiction of this Court may become \nsubject to an order of removal. The issues resolved in this case may have to be resolved over and \nagain as the government removal policy continues. Judicial efficiency, and considerations of due \nprocess for individuals yet to be ordered to be removed, support a class action. Moreover, here, \nthe facts are akin to those in Freiser, since many of the Class members cannot speak English, do \nnot have easy access to counsel, and share common questions. \"The approach laid out by \nthe Freiser court is, in short, both flexible and sensitive to the particular circumstances of a given \ncase.\" Martinez-Brooks v.  Easter, 459 F. Supp. 3d 411, 450 (D. Conn. 2020). \nAccordingly, I deny Respondents' motion to decertify the Class. The Clerk of Court shall \nterminate ECF No. 72. \nSO ORDERED. \nDated:  May 6, 2025 \nNew York, New York \nUnited States District Judge \n2 ",

TRUMP, et al., \nRespondents. \n---------·····-------------------------------------------- X \nALVIN K. HELLERSTEIN, U.S.DJ.: \nThis past Monday, April 7, 2025, the Supreme Court vacated the temporary restraining \norder of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, which enjoined the \nGovernment from removing, pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act (\"AEA\"), \"a provisionally \ncertified class consisting of'[a]ll noncitizens in lJ.S. custody who are subject to\"' Presidential \nProclamation No. 10903, invoking the AEA to detain and remove Venezuelan nationals who are \nmembers ofTren de Aragua (\"TdA\"), a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist \norganization, since, for core habeas petitions, jurisdiction lies in only the district of confinement. \nTrump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, at*! (April 7, 2025). The Court further ruled \nthat detainees subject to removal under the AEA \"are entitled to notice and oppo1tunity to be \nheard,\" and \"must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal \nunder the [AEA],\" which \"must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as \nwill allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs.\" \nId at *2. \nIn the aftermath of this decision, on April 8, 2025, Petitioners petitioned for a wiit of \nhabeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, and moved for a temporary restraining order and \nclass ce1tification, on behalf of a nationwide class subject to the Presidential Proclamation. See \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 32     Filed 04/09/25     Page 2 of 5\nECF Nos. 1-2, 4. Petitioners subsequently amended their motion for class ce1iification as to limit \nit to individuals confined within this District. See ECF Nos. 16-17. Specifically, Petitioners move \nto ce1iify a class action (i) seeking protection of those who are, or will be, subject to the AEA; \nand (ii) invalidating the AEA. The parties appeared before me on April 9, 2025 for a temporary \nrestraining order hearing. \n1 grant, in part, and deny, in pmi, Petitioners' requested relief. \nThe AEA provides, in pertinent pmi: \nWhenever there is a declared wm· between the United States and any foreign \nnation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion is pe1petrated, \nattempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign \nnation or government, and the President makes public proclamation of the event, \nall natives, citizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, \nbeing of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within the United \nStates and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be apprehended, restrained, \nsecured, and removed as alien enemies. The President is authorized in any such \nevent, by his proclamation thereof, or other public act, to direct the conduct to be \nobserved on the pmi of the United States, toward the aliens who become so liable; \nthe manner and degree of the restraint to which they shall be subject and in what \ncases, and upon what security their residence shall be permitted, and to provide \nfor the removal of those who, not being permitted to reside within the United \nStates, refuse or neglect to depmi therefrom; and to establish any other regulations \nwhich are found necessary in the premises and for the public safety. \n50 U.S.C. § 21. The statutory scheme also provides that after an individual subject to the AEA is \napprehended, they shall be provided \"a full examination and hem·ing on such complaint, and \nsufficient cause appearing, to order such alien to be removed out of the te1Titory of the United \nStates, or to give sureties for his good behavior, or to be otherwise restrained.\" 50 U.S.C. § 23. \nOn March 14, 2025, Respondent Donald Trump issued Presidential Proclamation No. \n10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13033 (2025), which invoked the AEA to detain and depoti suspected \nmembers ofTdA. The Presidential Proclamation states that \"TdA is pe1petrating, attempting, and \nthreatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territo1y of the United States,\" and that \nmembers ofTdA \"are, by vitiue of their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 32     Filed 04/09/25     Page 3 of 5\nhostility against the United States,\" and thus constitute \"a danger to the public peace or safety of \nthe United States.\" \nPetitioners seek to challenge the law and its application for a class, as they define, \"[a ] II \nnoncitizens in U.S. custody in the Southern District of New York who were, are, or will be \nsubject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies \nAct Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation.\" \nECFNo. 17. \nI hold that class certification is appropriate, but is limited to assuring that notice and a \nhearing is provided before any deportation, and that there be cause for deportation pursuant to \nthe statute and Presidential Proclamation. I leave considerations as to the validity of the \nPresidential Proclamation under the AEA for another day. \nThe Second Circuit has held that habeas petitions may be brought as class actions, and \nare not subject to the \"precise provisions\" of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23, the Rule which generally \ngoverns class action certification. United States ex rel. Sero v. Freiser, 506 F.2d 1115, 1125-26 \n(2d Cir. 1974). Instead, the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, and the reach of habeas corpus \njurisdiction, enable comis \"to fashion for habeas actions 'appropriate modes of procedure, by \nanalogy to existing rules or otherwise in conformity with judicial usage.'\" Id. at 1125 (q uoting \nHarris v.  Nelson, 394 U.S. 286,299 (1969)). \nIn Freiser, the Circuit determined that the \"unusual circumstances\" of that case-the \nfacts that class counsel's claim was \"applicable on behalf of the entire class, uncluttered by \nsubsidiary issues,\" and that many members of the class were \"likely to be illiterate or poorly \neducated, and ... would not have the benefit of counsel to prepare habeas corpus petitions\" \nprovided \"a compelling justification for allowing a multi-party proceeding similar to the class \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 32     Filed 04/09/25     Page 4 of 5\naction authorized by the Rules of Civil Procedure.\" 506 F.2d at 1125-26. And the Freiser panel \nalso noted that its decision that a habeas case could proceed as an aggregate action was further \nbolstered since the circumstances of the class in that case met the strictures of Fed. R. Civ. P. \n23(a). Id.  at 1126. \"The approach laid out by the Freiser court is, in short, both flexible and \nsensitive to the particular circumstances of a given case.\" Martinez-Brooks v. Easter, 459 F. \nSupp. 3d 411,450 (D. Conn. 2020). \nHere, the same circumstances apply. Petitioners' claim is applicable to the entire class, a \npopulation that is likely not to be conversant in English, and likely to not easily find counsel to \nfile individual habeas petitions. The members of the class, although sufficient to justify class \ntreatment, are limited to one or two places, and are similarly situated, and thus easily \nmanageable, and are similarly threatened by expulsion from this COlmtry. Petitioners satisfy the \nrequirements of Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a) in that they meet the requirements ofnumerosity, \ntypicality, common questions of law and fact as to the class, and adequate representation to \nensure that the interests of the class are protected. Specifically, numerosity is satisfied since there \nappear to be many persons similarly situated and detained in the Southern District of New York. \nJoinder of individuals is impractical given the limited available information as to the detainees \nwho are subject to the Presidential Proclamation in this District, as well as their limited access to \ncounsel. See Robidoux v.  Celani, 987 F.2d 931, 935-36 (2d Cir. 1993) (reversing district comi's \ndecision that numerosity was lacking since the \"[d ]etermination of practicability depends on all \nthe circumstances surrounding a case, not on mere numbers.\"). And typicality is likewise \nsatisfied since the claims of Petitioners are typical of the class in that they each face a common \ninjury based on the same government policy or practice. Each member of the class shares \ncommon issues of law and fact: the legality of the Presidential Proclamation under the AEA, and \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 32     Filed 04/09/25     Page 5 of 5\nthe notice and hearing required thereunder. And Petitioners' counsel can adequately represent all \npotential class members fairly and adequately. Accordingly, under Freiser, I find that it is \nappropriate to permit this habeas action to proceed on a class-wide basis. \nBased on the foregoing, I certify a class, for purposes of this habeas action, designated as \nfollows: \nAll noncitizens in U.S. custody in the Southern District of New York who were, \nare, or will be subject to the March 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled \n'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States \nby Tren De Aragua' and/or its implementation, who have not been given notice \nfollowing the Supreme Court's decision of April 7, 2025, Trump v. JG.G., No. \n24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, and granted a hearing. The notice to be provided \nshall be written in English and Spanish, the language of those sought to be \nexpelled, and if needed, Spanish-to-English interpreters shall be provided for \nhearings. \nI appoint Petitioners G.F.F. and J.G.O. as Class Representatives, and I further appoint \nPetitioners' counsel, attorneys of the American Civil Liberties Union and the Democracy \nForward Foundation, as class counsel. \nThe issue of what hearing is required under the AEA, whether in this Court, or some \nother forum, is reserved for further consideration at the prelimimuy injunction hearing, which \nwill be held on April 22, 2025, at 2:30 p.m., in Courtroom 14D. Since there is no need now to \ndetermine the validity of the Presidential Proclamation or the applicability of the AEA, I deny \nthat part of the motion as premature. \nThe Clerk of Court shall terminate ECF No. 4. \nSOORDEREl. \nDated:  April  , 2025 \nNewY  k,NewYork \nUnited States District Judge \n5 ",

HELLERSTEIN, U.S.D.J.: \n  This nation was founded on the “self-evident” truths “that all men are created equal, that \nthey are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, [and] that among these are \nLife, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” Declaration of Independence, at ¶ 2 (1776). Our \nConstitution embodies these truths, in a limited government of enumerated powers, in its system \nof checks and balances separating the executive, legislative and judicial branches, and in its \nguarantee that neither citizen nor alien be “deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due \nprocess of law.” U.S. Const. amend. V; see Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210-12 (1982) \n(extending these protections to aliens).  \nYet, in March 2025, more than 200 aliens were removed from this country to El \nSalvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center (“CECOT”), with faint hope of process or return. The \nsweep for removal is ongoing, extending to the litigants in this case and others, thwarted only by \norder of this and other federal courts. The destination, El Salvador, a country paid to take our \naliens, is neither the country from which the aliens came, nor to which they wish to be removed. \nBut they are taken there, and there to remain, indefinitely, in a notoriously evil jail, unable to \ncommunicate with counsel, family or friends.    \n \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 2 of 22\nRespondents purport to act under Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. \n13,033 (2025) (the “Presidential Proclamation”), which invoked a 1798 Act of Congress, the \nAlien Enemies Act (“AEA”), 50 U.S.C. §§ 21-24, to detain and deport suspected members of \nTren de Aragua (“TdA”), a Venezuelan gang and designated foreign terrorist organization. \nRespondents cite only the section of the AEA that grants power to the President to “apprehend[], \nrestrain[], secure[], and remove[]” aliens when “invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, \nattempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or \ngovernment.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. Conveniently, Respondents fail to mention another section of the \nAEA that imposes a “duty” on the federal courts to give a “full examination and hearing” to the \nExecutive’s “complaint” against the alien, and to order the alien’s removal only upon “sufficient \ncause appearing.” 50 U.S.C. § 23. Thus, under the AEA, and a recent decision of the United \nStates Supreme Court, removal may not occur except after notice and hearing. See Trump v. \nJ.G.G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1006 (2025). \nThe Court grants Petitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction against removal. This \nOpinion gives the reasons. It discusses the whole of the AEA, and shows that the Presidential \nProclamation, in mandating removal without due process, contradicts the AEA. The Opinion \ngoes on to discuss the requirements of notice and hearing under both the AEA and the \nConstitution. And it concludes that since Respondents have not demonstrated the existence of a \n“war,” “invasion” or “predatory incursion,” the AEA was not validly invoked by the Presidential \nProclamation. \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 3 of 22\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Procedural Posture \n  Petitioners G.F.F. and J.G.O., proceeding under pseudonyms, were initially detained in \nthe Orange County Jail, located in the Southern District of New York. ECF No. 1 at ¶¶ 11-12. In \nMarch 2025, they were transferred to a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) \ndetention facility in Texas, to be deported to El Salvador, only to be pulled off an airplane after a \ntemporary restraining order was issued by the United States District Court for the District of \nColumbia (later vacated on jurisdictional grounds by the United States Supreme Court). See id. \nSubsequently, Respondents returned G.F.F. and J.G.O. to the Orange County Jail, where they are \ncurrently detained, and still remain under threat of imminent removal. Id. On April 8, 2025, \nPetitioners filed for a writ of habeas corpus, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241, on behalf of \nthemselves and a similarly situated class, and moved for a temporary restraining order against \nremoval. ECF Nos. 1-2, 4. The case was randomly assigned to me. I set argument for the next \nday, April 9, 2025. ECF No. 6. \n  After hearing argument from both sides, I issued a temporary restraining order, see ECF \nNo. 31, which, as amended, enjoined Respondents from removing Petitioners from the United \nStates under the Presidential Proclamation, unless upon notice in English and Spanish and \nhearing, and from transferring Petitioners from the Southern District of New York. ECF No. 35. \nI also granted Petitioners’ motion for class certification, see ECF No. 32, which, as amended, \ndefined the Class: \nAll noncitizens in federal, state, or local custody in the Southern \nDistrict of New York who were, are, or will be subject to the March \n2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled ‘Invocation of the Alien \nEnemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren \nDe Aragua’ and/or its implementation, who have not been given \nnotice following the Supreme Court’s decision of April 7, 2025, \n \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 4 of 22\nTrump v. J.G.G., No. 24A931, 2025 WL 1024097, and granted a \nhearing. The notice to be provided shall be written in English and \nSpanish, the language of those sought to be expelled, and if needed, \nSpanish-to-English interpreters shall be provided for hearings. \nECF No. 34.  \n  On April 22, 2025, within the fourteen-day period allowed for temporary restraining \norders, and after full briefing, I heard argument on Petitioners’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction. I extended the temporary restraining order another two weeks, until May 6, 2025, or \nfurther order of the Court, to permit full consideration of the issues and the writing of this \nopinion. See ECF No. 78; see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2); SEC v. Unifund Sal, 910 F.2d 1028, \n1034-35 (2d Cir. 1990) (courts may extend a temporary restraining order while “reserving \ndecision on a motion for a preliminary injunction.”). \nII. The Alien Enemies Act \n  The AEA gives the President authority to detain and deport aliens in two instances: (1) a \ndeclared war between the United States and a foreign nation or government; or (2) an “invasion” \nor “predatory incursion” against this country by a foreign nation or government. 50 U.S.C. § 21.  \nWhenever there is a declared war between the United States and any \nforeign nation or government, or any invasion or predatory incursion \nis perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the \nUnited  States  by  any  foreign  nation  or  government,  and  the \nPresident  makes  public  proclamation  of  the  event,  all  natives, \ncitizens, denizens, or subjects of the hostile nation or government, \nbeing of the age of fourteen years and upward, who shall be within \nthe United States and not actually naturalized, shall be liable to be \napprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as alien enemies.  \n \nId. Section 21 goes on to provide what the President then may do: \nThe President is authorized in any such event, by his proclamation \nthereof, or other public act, to direct the conduct to be observed on \nthe part of the United States, toward the aliens who become so liable; \nthe manner and degree of the restraint to which they shall be subject \nand in what cases, and upon what security their residence shall be \npermitted, and to provide for the removal of those who, not being \n \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 5 of 22\npermitted to reside within the United States, refuse or neglect to \ndepart therefrom; and to establish any other regulations which are \nfound necessary in the premises and for the public safety. \nId.  \n \n  The AEA gives aliens who are “not chargeable with actual hostility, or other crime \nagainst the public safety” a “reasonable time” to self-deport and settle their affairs. 50 U.S.C. § \n22. \nWhen an alien who becomes liable as an enemy, in the manner \nprescribed in section 21 of this title, is not chargeable with actual \nhostility,  or  other  crime  against  the  public  safety,  he  shall  be \nallowed, for the recovery, disposal, and removal of his goods and \neffects, and for his departure, the full time which is or shall be \nstipulated by any treaty then in force between the United States and \nthe hostile nation or government of which he is a native citizen, \ndenizen, or subject; and where no such treaty exists, or is in force, \nthe President may ascertain and declare such reasonable time as may \nbe consistent with the public safety, and according to the dictates of \nhumanity and national hospitality. \nId. \n \n  The AEA also requires a “complaint” against the alien, that is, specific notice of acts \ncommitted, and judicial review by an Article III court to determine if there is “sufficient cause \nappearing,” before an alien may be removed. 50 U.S.C. § 23. \nAfter any such proclamation has been made, the several courts of \nthe  United  States,  having  criminal  jurisdiction,  and  the  several \njustices and judges of the courts of the United States, are authorized \nand it shall be their duty, upon complaint against any alien enemy \nresident and at large within such jurisdiction or district, to the danger \nof the public peace or safety, and contrary to the tenor or intent of \nsuch proclamation, or other regulations which the President may \nhave established, to cause such alien to be duly apprehended and \nconveyed  before  such  court,  judge,  or  justice;  and  after  a  full \nexamination and hearing on such complaint, and sufficient cause \nappearing, to order such alien to be removed out of the territory of \nthe United States, or to give sureties for his good behavior, or to be \notherwise  restrained,  conformably  to  the  proclamation  or \nregulations established as aforesaid, and to imprison, or otherwise \nsecure such alien, until the order which may be so made shall be \nperformed. \n \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 6 of 22\nId. \n \nIII.   The Presidential Proclamation \n \n  On March 14, 2025, Respondent Donald J. Trump issued his Presidential Proclamation \nunder authority of the AEA. His “findings” declare that TdA is “perpetrating, attempting, and \nthreatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United States,” and is \ndoing so “at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the Maduro regime in Venezuela.” 90 \nFed. Reg. at 13,034. \nSection 1.  I find and declare that TdA is perpetrating, attempting, \nand  threatening  an  invasion  or  predatory  incursion  against  the \nterritory of the United States. TdA is undertaking hostile actions and \nconducting irregular warfare against the territory of the United \nStates both directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of \nthe Maduro regime in Venezuela. I make these findings using the \nfull extent of my authority to conduct the Nation’s foreign affairs \nunder the Constitution. Based on these findings, and by the authority \nvested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States \nof  America,  including  50  U.S.C.  [§]  21,  I  proclaim  that  all \nVenezuelan citizens 14 years of age or older who are members of \nTdA, are within the United States, and are not actually naturalized \nor lawful permanent residents of the United States are liable to be \napprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies. I \nfurther find and declare that all such members of TdA are, by virtue \nof their membership in that organization, chargeable with actual \nhostility against the United States and are therefore ineligible for the \nbenefits of 50 U.S.C. [§] 22. I further find and declare that all such \nmembers of TdA are a danger to the public peace or safety of the \nUnited States. \nId. \n \nAccordingly, based on these findings, and without supporting evidence, the Presidential  \nProclamation directs the “immediate . . . removal” of TdA members. 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,034. But \nthe Presidential Proclamation makes no mention of the “complaint” and “full examination and \nhearing” provisions of the AEA, nor the duty it imposes on Article III courts. See 50 U.S.C. § 23. \nSec. 3.  I direct that all Alien Enemies described in section 1 of this \nproclamation are subject to immediate apprehension, detention, and \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 7 of 22\nremoval, and further that they shall not be permitted residence in the \nUnited States. \n \nSec. 4.  Pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act, the Attorney General \nand  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  shall,  consistent  with \napplicable law, apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove every Alien \nEnemy described in section 1 of this proclamation. The Secretary of \nHomeland Security retains discretion to apprehend and remove any \nAlien Enemy under any separate authority. \n \nSec. 5.  All executive departments and agencies (agencies) shall \ncollaborate with law enforcement officials of the United States and \nwith appropriate State, local, and tribal officials, to use all lawful \nmeans to apprehend, restrain, secure, and remove Alien Enemies \ndescribed in section 1 of this proclamation. \n \n90 Fed. Reg. at 13,034. \n \n  Finally, the Presidential Proclamation establishes various regulations “in the premises \nand for the public safety,” permitting “removal to any such location as may be directed by the \nofficers responsible for the execution of these regulations.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,035. The \nPresidential Proclamation makes no mention of an indefinite detention in a foreign jail hired by \nthe United States for such purpose. \n(a) No Alien Enemy described in section 1 of this proclamation shall \nenter, attempt to enter, or be found within any territory subject to the \njurisdiction of the United States. Any such Alien Enemy who enters, \nattempts  to  enter,  or  is  found  within  such  territory  shall  be \nimmediately  apprehended  and  detained  until  removed  from  the \nUnited States. All such Alien Enemies, wherever found within any \nterritory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, are subject \nto summary apprehension. \n \n(b) Alien Enemies apprehended pursuant to this proclamation shall be \nsubject to detention until removed from the United States in such \nplace of detention as may be directed by the officers responsible for \nthe execution of these regulations. \n \n(c) Alien Enemies shall be subject to removal to any such location as \nmay be directed by the officers responsible for the execution of these \nregulations consistent with applicable law. \n \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 8 of 22\n(d)  All property in the possession of, or traceable to, an Alien Enemy, \nwhich  is  used,  intended  to  be  used,  or  is  commonly  used  to \nperpetrate the hostile activity and irregular warfare of TdA, along \nwith evidence of such hostile activity and irregular warfare, shall be \nsubject to seizure and forfeiture. \nId. \n \nIV.   The United States Supreme Court \n  On April 7, 2025, the Supreme Court ruled that detainees subject to removal under the \nAEA “are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard.” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006. \nSpecifically, they “must receive notice after the date of this order [April 7, 2025] that they are \nsubject to removal under the [AEA],” which “must be afforded within a reasonable time and in \nsuch a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such \nremoval occurs.” Id. The Court held that habeas relief must be sought in the district where the \nalien is in custody, and accordingly vacated the order of the United States District Court for the \nDistrict of Columbia, which had enjoined the Government from removing these aliens, since \nthey were not in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of that district court. Id. \n  More recently, on April 19, 2025, the Supreme Court enjoined the deportation of a \nputative class of detainees confined in the Northern District of Texas under the Presidential \nProclamation and AEA, citing the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a). A.A.R.P. v. Trump, 145 S. \nCt. 1034, 1034 (2025).  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that (1) he is likely to succeed \non the merits; (2) he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief; (3) \nthe balance of equities tips in his favor; and (4) an injunction is in the public interest. Winter v. \nNRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). “Where, as here, the government is a party to the suit, the \n \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 9 of 22\nfinal two factors merge.” New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 969 F.3d 42, 58-59 (2d \nCir. 2020). \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Judicial Review  \nAs a threshold matter, this Court has jurisdiction to interpret the AEA and review the  \nPresidential Proclamation. “[A]n individual subject to detention and removal under that statute is \nentitled to ‘judicial review’ as to ‘questions of interpretation and constitutionality’ of the Act as \nwell as whether he or she ‘is in fact an alien enemy.’” J.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006 (quoting \nLudecke v. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 163, 172, n.17 (1948)). This Court has the duty and burden to \nprovide such judicial review. \n  In Ludecke, Justice Frankfurter wrote that the President’s power to consider World War II \ncontinuing, even though active hostilities had ceased, to justify detention and removal of \nsuspected saboteurs, could not be judicially reviewed. Ludecke, 335 U.S. at 170. The Supreme \nCourt in J.G.G., writing per curiam, and cognizant of Ludecke, ruled clearly that aliens are \nentitled to notice and a habeas hearing before they can be removed pursuant to the AEA. J.G.G., \n145 S. Ct. at 1006. \nII.    Notice and hearing \n  Respondents, having failed previously to provide notice, now concede that notice is \nrequired, but only in the most cursory form, and not always. In Texas, ICE officers gave aliens \nabout to be removed copies of “Form AEA-21B,” which advises them, in English, that: \nYou have been determined to be at least fourteen years of age; not a \ncitizen or lawful permanent resident of the United States; a citizen \nof Venezuela; and a member of Tren de Aragua. Accordingly, under \nthe Alien Enemies Act, you have been determined to be an Alien \nEnemy subject to apprehension, restraint, and removal from the \nUnited States. Until you are removed from the United States, you \n \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 10 of 22\nwill be detained under Title 50, United States Code, Section 21. Any \nstatement you make now or while you are in custody may be used \nagainst you in any administrative or criminal proceeding. This is not \na removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. If you desire \nto make a phone call, you will be permitted to do so. \n \nSee J.A.V. v. Trump, 25 Civ. 72 (S.D. Tex.), ECF No. 49; W.M.M. v. Trump, 25 Civ. 59 (N.D. \nTex.), ECF No. 34. The notice is a fleeting affair, for if the alien fails to express an intent to file a \npetition for habeas relief within a dozen hours of being served with a “Form AEA-21B,” or to \nactually file a petition within another 24-hour period, ICE “may proceed with removal.” J.A.V. v. \nTrump, 25 Civ. 72 (S.D. Tex.), ECF No. 49, ¶ 11. And even if an alien files for habeas relief, \nRespondents state that they still may deport him if the court does not grant a temporary \nrestraining order, or takes too long to conduct the proceeding. Id. at ¶ 12. The declaration of \nCarlos D. Cisneros, an Assistant Field Office Director for ICE, states: \n11.   Although there may be fact-specific exceptional cases, in a \ngeneral case, after an alien is served with Form AEA 21-B, the alien \nis given a reasonable amount of time, and no less than 12 hours, \nincluding the ability to make a telephone call, to indicate or express \nan intent to file a habeas petition. If the alien does not express any \nsuch intention, then ICE may proceed with the removal, though such \nremoval may not actually occur for many more hours or days, giving \nthe alien additional time to express an intent. If the alien does \nexpress an intent to file a habeas petition, the alien is given a \nreasonable amount of time, and no less than 24 hours, to actually file \nthat petition. If the alien does not file such a petition within 24 hours, \nthen ICE may proceed with the removal, though such removal may \nnot actually occur for many more hours or days, giving the alien \nadditional time to file the petition. Further, because aliens subject to \nthe AEA are often detained for several days before removal, they \nfrequently have much more time to express an intent to file a habeas \npetition  or  to  actually  file  such  a  petition.  Moreover,  these \ntimeframes are consistent  with,  if not  more generous than, the \ntimeframes used for expedited removal procedures under Title 8.  \n \n12.  In nearly every case in which an alien files a habeas petition \nbased  on  detention  related  to  the  AEA,  the  alien  also  seeks  a \nTemporary Restraining Order (TRO). The TRO request is typically \nadjudicated  quickly,  sometimes  within  hours  of  being  filed. \n \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 11 of 22\nAlthough there may be fact-specific exceptional cases, in a general \ncase, ICE will not remove under the AEA an alien who has filed a \nhabeas petition while that petition is pending. However, ICE may \nreconsider that position in cases where a TRO has been denied and \nthe habeas proceedings have not concluded within a reasonable \ntime. \n \nId. at ¶¶ 11-12. Respondents’ proposal for notice is insufficient under the AEA, the Supreme \nCourt’s ruling in J.G.G., and Constitutional due process. \n  Under the AEA, after the President issues a proclamation, an alien becomes “liable to be \napprehended, restrained, secured, and removed.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. The President then can \n“provide for the removal” of the alien. Id. But the Executive must do so by filing a “complaint” \nbefore an Article III court. 50 U.S.C. § 23. The court then has the “duty” to conduct a “full \nexamination and hearing,” to determine if “sufficient cause” exists and, if it does, to order such \nalien to be removed. Id. The complaint serves as the notice to the alien. \n  A complaint is a document with content, customarily alleging facts and grounds leading \nto an outcome. Cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8; Fed. R. Crim. P. 3; 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1). It is not a bare \nbones form letter. The notice must advise the alien of the acts he committed that justify his \nremoval. See Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950) (notice \nmust “apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to \npresent their objections” and “must be of such nature as reasonably to convey the required \ninformation”); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a)(1) (requiring, under the INA, for notice to specify the \n“nature of the proceedings against the alien,” the “legal authority under which the proceedings \nare conducted,” the “acts or conduct alleged to be in violation of law,” and the “charges against \nthe alien and the statutory provisions alleged to have been violated.”). The notice also must give \nthe alien a reasonable amount of time to prepare and file, or to find counsel to prepare and file, a \nhabeas petition. See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(b)(1) (requiring, under the INA, for a hearing to be held no \n \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 12 of 22\nfewer than ten days after service of notice “[i]n order that an alien be permitted the opportunity \nto secure counsel”).  \n  The notice proposed by Respondents does not moot this issue. Petitioners have not been \ngiven notice of what they allegedly did to join TdA, when they joined, and what they did in the \nUnited States, or anywhere else, to share or further the illicit objectives of the TdA. Without such \nproof, Petitioners are subject to removal by the Executive’s dictate alone, in contravention of the \nAEA and the Constitutional requirements of due process.  \n  The Supreme Court’s opinion in J.G.G. reflects its view as to what due process requires \nunder the AEA. As the Supreme Court stated: \nAlthough judicial review under the AEA is limited, we have held \nthat an individual subject to detention and removal under that statute \nis entitled to “‘judicial review’” as to “questions of interpretation \nand constitutionality” of the Act as well as whether he or she “is in \nfact an alien enemy fourteen years of age or older.” Ludecke, 335 \nU.S. at 163, 172, n. 17 . . . . \n \nSo, the detainees are entitled to notice and opportunity to be heard \n“appropriate to the nature of the case.” Mullane v. Central Hanover \nBank & Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 313 (1950). More specifically, in \nthis context, AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this \norder that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must \nbe afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will \nallow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before \nsuch removal occurs. \n \nJ.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006. Notice sufficient to enable a person to defend himself is basic to due \nprocess.    \n“The fundamental requisite of due process of law is the opportunity \nto be heard.” This right to be heard has little reality or worth unless \none is informed that the matter is pending and can choose for himself \nwhether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest.  \n \nMullane, 339 U.S. at 314 (quoting Grannis v. Ordean, 234 U.S. 385, 394 (1914)). Interested \nparties must be given notice of the “pendency of the action” so that they have the “opportunity to \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 13 of 22\npresent their objections.” Mullane, 339 U.S. at 314. This right of notice applies to aliens as well \nas to citizens, see Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 306 (1993); Plyler, 457 U.S. at 210-12, and I \nhold that here, pursuant to the All Writs Act, it cannot be defeated by moving a petitioner from \none place of confinement to another. See 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a); Local 1814, Int’l Longshoremen’s \nAss’n v. New York Shipping Ass’n, 965 F.2d 1224, 1237 (2d Cir. 1992) (“Once the district court \nacquires jurisdiction over the subject matter of, and the parties to, the litigation, the All Writs Act \n[28 U.S.C. § 1651] authorizes a federal court to protect that jurisdiction.”). \n  The Supreme Court has provided a framework to enable lower courts to assess how much \nprocess is due in individual cases. See Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 334-35 (1976). \n“[I]dentification of the specific dictates of due process generally requires consideration of three \ndistinct factors:” (1) “the private interest that will be affected by the official action;” (2) “the risk \nof an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, \nif any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards;” and (3) “the Government’s interest, \nincluding the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or \nsubstitute procedural requirement would entail.” Id. at 335. \n  “The requirements of the due process clause are flexible and dependent on the \ncircumstances of the particular situation examined.” Augustin v. Sava, 735 F.2d at 32, 37 (2d Cir. \n1984). Here, the private interests of Petitioners to protect their liberty and not to be deported to \nCECOT for indefinite detention are exceptionally strong. See Lopez v. Decker, 978 F.3d 842, \n851 (2d Cir. 2020) (the private interest of an alien in being free from imprisonment “is the most \nsignificant liberty interest there is”). And the risk of erroneous deprivation of an alien’s liberty \ninterest, without a “full examination and hearing” following the filing of a complaint by the \nGovernment, as required by the AEA, is great. Indeed, the summary procedures used by \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 14 of 22\nRespondents have already resulted in the wrongful removal of at least two individuals to \nCECOT. See Noem v. Abrego Garcia, No. 24A949, 2025 WL 1077101, at *1 (April 10, 2025); \nJ.O.P. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Security, 19 Civ. 1944, 2025 WL 1180191, at *7 (D. Md. Apr. \n23, 2025).  \n  The third consideration set out by Mathews, the “Government’s interest,” is more \ncomplicated. Drafting complaints with particular allegations against individual aliens, providing \naliens with time to contact counsel and file a habeas petition, and preparing for a hearing before a \nfederal judge takes time and manpower. However, it is the nature of due process to cause fiscal \nand administrative burdens. Rule by the ipse dixit of a President is likely more efficient than the \ndeliberative procedures of a court. But it is what our Constitution, and the rule of law, demand. \nAnd due process, once surrendered, is difficult to reinstate. \n  The Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”) has ample procedures to cause the removal \nof aliens without sacrificing their right to notice and a hearing. It also contains provisions for the \nexpedited removal of certain eligible aliens. See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225, 1228. Respondents argue, \nhowever, that they have a choice to proceed either under the INA or the AEA. That is so, but if \nRespondents wish to proceed under the AEA, they must follow all of its provisions, and may not \nthrow Constitutional due process protections to the wayside. \n  The Presidential Proclamation, in order to empower the Executive beyond the provisions \nof the AEA, subtly changes the clause “shall be liable to be . . . removed” in the AEA, 50 U.S.C. \n§ 21, to “shall be subject to immediate . . . removal,” in the Presidential Proclamation, 90 Fed. \nReg. at 13,034. This change is ultra vires; the Proclamation gives the President no more \nauthority than the act of Congress prescribes. See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 \nU.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring). If the President wishes to bypass the INA and use \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 15 of 22\nthe AEA, he must do so according to the requirements of the AEA and Constitutional due \nprocess. \nIII.    The statutory bases for invoking the Presidential Proclamation have not been \nsatisfied \n \n  The AEA can be invoked by the President in two instances: (a) “[w]henever there is a \ndeclared war between the United States and any foreign nation or government,” or if (b) “any \ninvasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of \nthe United States by any foreign nation or government.” 50 U.S.C. § 21. The President then can \nmake “public proclamation of the event.” Id. Here, the Presidential Proclamation found and \ndeclared that the second of the two events had occurred, specifically, “that TdA is perpetrating, \nattempting, and threatening an invasion or predatory incursion against the territory of the United \nStates,” and that it is doing so “directly and at the direction, clandestine or otherwise, of the \nMaduro regime in Venezuela.” 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,034. Respondents aver that TdA members \nhave infiltrated the stream of Venezuelan refugees who have entered our borders, are \n“conducting irregular warfare and undertaking hostile actions against the United States,” and \nconstitute “a danger to the public peace or safety of the United States.” Id. \n  Respondents argue that the courts are without power to review these findings. Courts, \nhowever, by their nature, interpret statutes. See Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803) (“It \nis emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is. Those \nwho apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.”); Loper \nBright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 385, 387 (2024). As the Supreme Court ruled: \nAlthough judicial review under the AEA is limited, we have held \nthat an individual subject to detention and removal under that statute \nis entitled to “‘judicial review’” as to “questions of interpretation \nand constitutionality” of the Act as well as whether he or she “is in \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 16 of 22\nfact an alien enemy fourteen years of age or older.” Ludecke, 335 \nU.S. at 163, 172, n. 17. \n \nJ.G.G., 145 S. Ct. at 1006.  \n   \n  A statute should be interpreted as to its plain meaning at the time of its adoption, in the \ncontext of the events of that time. See Wisconsin Central Ltd. v. United States, 585 U.S. 274, 277 \n(2018) (“As usual, our job is to interpret the words consistent with their ‘ordinary meaning . . . at \nthe time Congress enacted the statute.’”) (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.S. 37, 42 \n(1979))); Consumer Prod. Safety Comm’n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980) \n(“[T]he starting point for interpreting a statute is the language of the statute itself.”); see also \nUtah v. Evans, 536 U.S. 452, 492 (2002) (“Dictionary definitions contemporaneous with the \nratification of the Constitution inform our understanding.”) (Thomas, J., concurring). In 1798, \nthe United States was engaged in an undeclared war with France. See David McCullough, John \nAdams, at 499-505 (2001). Their respective navies fought each other at sea. Id. at 499. The \nAmerican government feared incursions by the French in the territories west of the Appalachian \nMountains. See id. Congress appropriated money to arm merchant ships and to pay for an army. \nId. A declaration of war was discussed, and the Alien and Sedition Acts, including the AEA, \nwere passed. Id. at 503-504. The AEA reflects the condition of its time. \n  An “invasion,” as used in the AEA, was understood as a “[h]ostile entrance upon the \nright or possessions of another” or a “hostile encroachment,” such as when “William the \nConqueror invaded England.” Samuel Johnson, Invasion, A Dictionary of the English Language \n(4th ed. 1773). Another dictionary defined “invasion” as a “hostile entrance into the possession \nof another; particularly the entrance of a hostile army into a country for the purpose of conquest \nor plunder, or the attack of a military force.” Noah Webster, Invasion, American Dictionary of \nthe English Language (1828). The Constitution itself uses the term “invasion” on three \n \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 17 of 22\noccasions, all of which occur within the context of military action by a foreign state against the \nterritorial integrity of the United States. Specifically, Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution \nprovides Congress with the power to “call[] forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, \nsuppress Insurrections and repel Invasion,” Section 9 of Article I, also known as the “Suspension \nClause,” bars the suspension of the habeas writ, “unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion \nthe public Safety may require it,” and Section 4 of Article IV, also known as the “Invasion \nClause,” provides that the federal government “shall protect [the states] against Invasion.” See \nalso Padavan v. United States, 82 F.3d 23, 28 (2d Cir. 1996) (affirming dismissal of a count of a \ncomplaint against the federal government, alleging a violation of the Invasion Clause for failing \nto protect New York from an influx of aliens, since “[i]n order for a state to be afforded the \nprotections of the Invasion Clause, it must be exposed to armed hostility from another political \nentity, such as another state or foreign country that is intending to overthrow the state’s \ngovernment.”).  \n  In a similar vein, an “incursion” was understood to mean an “[a]ttack” or “[i]nvasion \nwithout conquest.” Samuel Johnson, Incursion, A Dictionary of the English Language (4th ed. \n1773). And early cases used the term “predatory incursion” to refer to military-like conflicts \nwaged by an Indian tribe or a foreign nation-state, as opposed to civil immigration violations. \nSee, e.g., Huidekoper’s Lesssee v. Douglass, 7 U.S. 1, 7 (1805) (referring to a measure intended \nto “repel the predatory incursions of the Indians” as an antidote to an Indian war); Cherokee \nNation v. Georgia, 30 U.S. 1, 10 (1831) (“The place, to which they removed under this last \ntreaty, is said to be exposed to incursions of hostile Indians, and that they are engaged in constant \nscenes of killing and scalping, and have to wage a war of extermination with more powerful \ntribes, before whom they will ultimately fall.”); Worcester v. Georgia, 31 U.S. 515, 545 (1832) \n \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 18 of 22\n(“These barbarous nations, whose incursions were feared, and to repel whose incursions the \npower to make war was given, were surely not considered as the subjects of Penn, or occupying \nhis lands during his pleasure.”).  \n  The modern definitions are similar. An incursion means “a hostile inroad or invasion” or \n“a sudden attack.” Incursion, Oxford English Dictionary (1971). Another dictionary defines the \nterm “incursion” as “a hostile entrance into or invasion of a place or territory, esp[ecially] one of \nsudden character,” or a “raid.” Incursion, The Random House Dictionary of the English \nLanguage (1967). And the term “invasion” is defined as “the action of invading a country or \nterritory as an enemy; an entrance of incursion with armed force; a hostile inroad,” Invasion, \nOxford English Dictionary (1971), or “the act or instance of invading or entering as an enemy, \nesp[ecially] by an army,” Invasion, The Random House Dictionary of the English Language \n(1967). \n  Accordingly, I hold that the predicates for the Presidential Proclamation, that TdA has \nengaged in either a “war,” “invasion” or a “predatory incursion” of the United States, do not \nexist. Others courts have resolved this issue similarly. See, e.g., J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-5068, \n2025 WL 914682, at *8-10 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 26, 2025) (Henderson, J., concurring); J.A.V. v. \nTrump, 25 Civ. 72, 2025 WL 1257450, at *12-18 (S.D. Tex. May 1, 2025); D.B.U. v. Trump, 25 \nCiv. 1163, 2025 WL 1163530, at *9-11 (D. Col. Apr. 22, 2025). There is nothing in the AEA \nthat justifies a finding that refugees migrating from Venezuela, or TdA gangsters who infiltrate \nthe migrants, are engaged in an “invasion” or “predatory incursion.” They do not seek to occupy \nterritory, to oust American jurisdiction from any territory, or to ravage territory. TdA may well \nbe engaged in narcotics trafficking, but that is a criminal matter, not an invasion or predatory \nincursion.  \n \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 19 of 22\n  Thus, I find that the Presidential Proclamation exceeds the scope of the AEA, and I \nenjoin Respondents, their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and any persons who \nare in active concert or participation with them, from enforcing it. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2). I \nalso hold that Petitioners have made the requisite showing for a preliminary injunction as to their \nlikelihood to succeed on the merits here. \nIV.   Petitioners have demonstrated irreparable harm  \n  I further find that Petitioners have demonstrated that they are “likely to suffer irreparable \nharm in the absence of preliminary relief.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. Generally, deportation “alone \ncannot constitute the requisite irreparable injury,” since typically, “[a]n alien who has been \nremoved may continue to pursue a petition for review, and those aliens who prevail can be \nafforded effective relief by facilitation of their return.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009). But here, this is not so.  \n  In the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who the Government concedes was deported to El \nSalvador as “the result of an “‘administrative error,’” Respondents have not been able to secure \nhis release and return to the United States, notwithstanding the Supreme Court’s ruling that the \ndistrict court “properly require[d] the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia’s release from \ncustody in El Salvador.” Abrego Garcia, 2025 WL 1077101, at *1. In Abrego Garcia’s case, \nRespondents have averred in a brief that since he was already deported to El Salvador, the court \nlacks jurisdiction, and Abrego Garcia cannot show redressability. See Abrego Garcia v. Noem, \n25 Civ. 951, ECF No. 12-1, at 7-12.  \n  “Unlike economic harm, the harm resulting from expulsion from the United States \npursuant to an unlawful policy likely cannot be remediated after the fact.” Huisha-Huisha v. \nMayorkas, 560 F. Supp. 3d 146, 172 (D.D.C. 2021), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, and remanded \n \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 20 of 22\non other grounds, 27 F.4th 718 (D.C. Cir. 2022); see also Doe v. Mattis, 928 F.3d 1, 22 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (finding irreparable harm likely to result from the transfer of a dual citizen to an \nunidentified country since he would be in the custody of that country “without any continuing \noversight by—or recourse to—the United States.”). Here, absent a preliminary injunction, \nPetitioners would be removed from the United States to CECOT, where they would endure abuse \nand inhumane treatment with no recourse to bring them back. If that is not irreparable harm, \nwhat is? \nV.    The remaining requirements for a preliminary injunction have been satisfied \n  I also hold that Petitioners have met their burden as to the other prerequisites for a \npreliminary injunction, since the final two factors—the public interest and the balance of the \nequities—which merge in suits against the Government, see New York, 969 F.3d at 58-59, also \nfavor granting a preliminary injunction here. Petitioners are currently detained in federal \nimmigration custody, and thus do not pose a risk to the public’s safety. But the public has a \nstrong interest in ensuring that the branches of our government do not exceed their powers and \nviolate the rights of others in the process. See Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t \nof Health & Human Servs., 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (“It is evident that ‘[t]here \nis generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.’” (quoting League \nof Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016))). “Of course there is a public \ninterest in preventing aliens from being wrongfully removed, particularly to countries where they \nare likely to face substantial harm.” Nken, 556 U.S. at 436. And equity demands enjoining \nunlawful conduct that cannot be readily undone to ensure individuals’ Constitutional rights are \nsafeguarded. Thus, I find that the public interest and balance of the equities here, too, favor \ngranting a preliminary injunction in favor of Petitioners.  \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 21 of 22\nVI.   Security Bond \n  I decline to order Petitioners to post a security bond. “Rule 65(c) gives the district court \nwide discretion to set the amount of a bond, and even to dispense with the bond requirement \nwhere there has been no proof of likelihood of harm, or where the injunctive order was issued to \naid and preserve the court's jurisdiction over the subject matter involved.” Doctor's Assocs., Inc. \nv. Distajo, 107 F.3d 126, 136 (2d Cir. 1997) (citation omitted). Here, there is no proof of \nlikelihood of harm to Respondents that would result from the issuance of this preliminary \ninjunction, and thus, Petitioners need not post bond.  \nCONCLUSION \n  Based on the foregoing, I grant Petitioners’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nAccordingly, Respondents, their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys, and any persons \nwho are in active concert or participation with them, are hereby:  \n1.     Enjoined, pending further order of this Court, from enforcing, in the Southern  \nDistrict of New York, Presidential Proclamation No. 10903, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,033 (2025) entitled \n“Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act Regarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De \nAragua,” and are thus prohibited from, inter alia, removing Petitioners, including members of \nthe Certified Class, from the United States, under authority of said Presidential Proclamation. \n2.  Ordered, pending further order of this Court, pursuant to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C.  \n§ 1651(a), not to transfer Petitioners, including members of the Certified Class, ECF No. 34, \nfrom the Southern District of New York, provided, however, that nothing in this Order shall be \nconstrued to bar the removal, or release from immigration detention, of Petitioners pursuant to \nproceedings held under the Immigration and Nationality Act. \n3.  Ordered that Petitioners shall not be required to furnish security, since Respondents \n \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 84     Filed 05/06/25     Page 22 of 22\nhave not shown proof of likelihood of harm that would result from the issuance of this \npreliminary injunction. \nThis Order shall remain in effect during the pendency of this action, or until further order \nof this Court. \nThe parties shall settle, on two days' notice, the terms of a proposed amended preliminary \ninjunction order, consistent with this Opinion. \nThe parties are hereby ordered to appear for a pre-trial conference on May 21, 2025, at \n2:30 p.m., in Courtroom 14D. By May 19, 2025, the parties shall submit to the Court (via the \nemail address HellersteinNYSDChambers@nysd.uscourts.gov) a joint list of attorneys expected \nto appear on the record at this conference, and an agenda of what they wish to discuss. \nSO ORDERED. \n~ k , V ~  \nDated:  May 6, 2025 \nNew York, New York  ALVIN K.

Reg. 13033 (2025) (the “Presidential \nProclamation”), since in a habeas case, venue is proper only in the district of confinement; held \nthat an individual subject to detention and removal under the Alien Enemies Act (“AEA”), 50 \nU.S.C. § 21, et seq., is entitled to judicial review; and ruled that detainees being held pursuant to \nthe AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard in such a manner as to allow them \nto seek habeas relief in the proper venue—the district of confinement—before such removal \noccurs; and \nWHEREAS, I find that Petitioners are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that \nneither the AEA, nor the Presidential Proclamation, authorizes removal of detainees or other \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-02886-AKH     Document 35     Filed 04/11/25     Page 2 of 3\npersons similarly situated, without notice and hearing; that Petitioners and persons similarly \nsituated will suffer irreparable injury in the absence of injunctive relief; and that the balance of \nhardships and the public interest favor temporary relief, it is, therefore: \nORDERED that Respondents, their agents, representatives, and all persons or entities \nacting in concert with them are hereby: \n1. ORDERED, pending further order of this Court, not to remove Petitioners, including \nmembers of the certified class defined as “All noncitizens in federal, state, or local \ncustody in the Southern District of New York who were, are, or will be subject to the \nMarch 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act \nRegarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its \nimplementation, who have not been given notice following the Supreme Court's \ndecision of April 7, 2025, Trump v.

ORDERED, pending further order of this Court, not to transfer Petitioners, including \nmembers of the certified class defined as “All noncitizens in federal, state, or local \ncustody in the Southern District of New York who were, are, or will be subject to the \nMarch 2025 Presidential Proclamation entitled 'Invocation of the Alien Enemies Act \nRegarding the Invasion of the United States by Tren De Aragua' and/or its \nimplementation, who have not been given notice following the Supreme Court's \ndecision of April 7, 2025, Trump v.

ORDERED that Respondents shall file their brief in opposition to a preliminary\ninjunction by April 15, 2025, and that Petitioners shall file their reply brief by April\n17, 2025; and\n5.
