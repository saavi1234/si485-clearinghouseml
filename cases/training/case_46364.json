    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit was about a final rule issued by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services on May 10, 2024, 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (&ldquo;Final Rule&rdquo;). The Final Rule imposed stricter staffing standards on all nursing homes that participated in Medicare or Medicaid, including requiring a registered nurse to be onsite 24 hours a day, 7 days a week (&ldquo;24/7 RN requirement&rdquo;) and requiring a minimum number of nursing staff hours per resident per day regardless of the residents&rsquo; specific needs (&ldquo;HPRD requirement&rdquo;).</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiffs in this case were long-term care facilities and associations of long-term care providers&mdash;American Health Care Association, Texas Health Care Association, Arbrook Plaza, Booker Hospital District, and Harbor Lakes Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center. They filed this lawsuit on May 23, 2024 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, naming the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its Secretary and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and its Administrator as Defendants. Represented by private counsel, the Plaintiffs argued that the standards imposed under the Final Rule were impossible to meet and would ultimately harm thousands of nursing homes the residents they served. They alleged that the Final Rule exceeded Defendants&rsquo; statutory authority in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. They sought attorneys&rsquo; fees, declaratory relief, and injunctive relief, asking the court to issue an order vacating both the 24/7 RN requirement and the HPRD requirement. The case was assigned to District Judge Matthew Joseph Kacsmaryk and Magistrate Judge Lee Ann Reno.</p>\r\n<p>On June 18, 2024, the Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding LeadingAge, a membership organization of nonprofit aging service providers, as a Plaintiff. The state of Texas filed a substantively identical lawsuit against the same Defendants on August 14, State of Texas v. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2:24-cv-00171). On September 18, the Court ordered that the cases be consolidated, and the state of Texas joined this lawsuit as a Plaintiff.</p>\r\n<p>The Plaintiffs filed a joint motion for summary judgment on October 18, 2024, and the Defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment on November 15, 2024. Following a series of motions, responses, and amicus briefs, Judge Kacsmaryk ruled in favor of Plaintiffs. On April 7, 2025, the Court issued an opinion granting Plaintiffs&rsquo; motion for summary judgment and denying Defendants&rsquo; cross motion. 777 F.Supp.3d 691. The Court found that both the 24/7 RN and HPRD requirements exceeded Defendants&rsquo; statutory authority. Specifically, the Court found that the Final Rule imposed requirements inconsistent with the Nursing Facility Reform Law enacted by Congress in 1987. The Reform Law in part required a registered nurse to be on site for only eight hours per day, and required nursing facilities to consider residents&rsquo; individualized needs when determining other staffing, which the Court found to be inconsistent with the strict numerical mandate of the HPRD requirement. Because the Court found that the Final Rule&rsquo;s challenged provisions contravened Congress&rsquo;s prescriptions under the Reform Law, it did not reach arbitrary and capricious analysis or the major questions doctrine arguments that Plaintiffs raised in their complaint. The Court then vacated that challenged provisions of the Final Rule.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 10, 2025, this case remains open because the court&rsquo;s order is within the window of appeal.</p>",

On May 10, 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”) issued a rule imposing onerous new minimum-staffing requirements on \nvirtually all U.S. nursing homes.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024) (“Final \nRule”).    That  rule  exceeds  CMS’s  statutory  authority,  effects  a  baffling  and \nunexplained  departure  from  the  agency’s  longstanding  position,  and  creates \nimpossible-to-meet standards that will harm thousands of nursing homes and the \nvulnerable Americans they serve. \n2.  Decades ago, Congress established two basic staffing requirements for \nnursing homes that participate in Medicare or Medicaid—as more than 97% of U.S. \nnursing homes do.  First, a nursing home “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse [(“RN”)] for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  \n42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  Second, a nursing \nhome “must provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to meet \nthe  nursing  needs  of  its  residents.”    Id.  §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i);  accord  id.  §1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i).   \n3.  Over  the  years,  Congress  has  considered  alternative  regulatory \napproaches,  including  proposals  to  replace  the  flexible  sufficient-staffing \nrequirement with a one-size-fits-all numerical minimum staffing requirement.  But \neach time, Congress has declined to adopt such proposals, and instead concluded \n1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 3 of 56   PageID 3\n \nthat the adequacy of nursing home staffing should be determined flexibly based on \nthe particularized needs of each facility.   \n4.  Dissatisfied with Congress’ judgment, CMS decided to take matters \ninto its own hands.  At the direction of the President, the agency proposed and has \nnow adopted a rule that overrides both of Congress’ statutory requirements.  \n5.  The  Final  Rule  explicitly—and  brazenly—“revises”  the  first \nrequirement by tripling it, replacing Congress’ directive to employ an RN for 8 \nconsecutive hours, 7 days a week, with CMS’s own directive to have an RN “onsite \n24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40898, 40997.  And the Final \nRule  departs  from  the  second  statutory  staffing  requirement  too,  replacing  the \nflexible  qualitative  standard  Congress  chose  with  three  rigid  quantitative \nrequirements.  Instead of following Congress’ decision to require nursing services \n“sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing  needs”  of  each  facility’s  residents,  42  U.S.C. \n§1396r(b)(4)(C)(i), the Final Rule demands that every facility across the nation—\nregardless of its residents’ actual needs—provide (i) total nurse staffing of at least \n3.48 hours per resident day (“HPRD”), including (ii) RN staffing of at least 0.55 \nHPRD and (iii) nurse aide (“NA”) staffing of at least 2.45 HPRD.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n40877.   \n6.  CMS does not even try to claim that the statutory provisions in which \nCongress  explicitly  addressed  staffing  requirements  empower  it  to  enact  these \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 4 of 56   PageID 4\n \nsweeping new mandates.  CMS instead claims that this power is lurking in “various \nprovisions” of the Medicare and Medicaid Acts that enable the agency to promulgate \nrequirements promoting resident health and safety.  Id. at 40879, 40890-91.  But that \nargument  runs  headlong  into  basic  principles  of  administrative  law,  as  generic \nrulemaking provisions do not empower agencies to “revise” legislative enactments \nand promote their own policy du jour over the policy choices that Congress enacted \ninto federal law.   \n7.  That is particularly clear here given the long history of congressional \naction in this area, the staggering breadth of the regulatory authority CMS now \nasserts, and the massive economic and political significance of that assertion.  Even \nby CMS’s low-ball estimate, nursing homes will need to spend more than $40 billion \nover the next decade to comply with these new staffing requirements.  Congress has \nnever delegated to CMS the authority to impose such onerous and unachievable \nmandates on practically every nursing home in the country. \n8.  Even  if  Congress  had  delegated  CMS  the  authority  it  claims,  the \nagency’s decision to adopt the new minimum-staffing standards was arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  It simply \nmakes no sense to impose a blanket 24/7 RN requirement and rigid staffing ratios on \nthousands and thousands of nursing homes across the country, regardless of each \nparticular facility’s local conditions and unique circumstances.  As CMS and its \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 5 of 56   PageID 5\n \npredecessor agencies have repeatedly explained in a series of regulations spanning \nmore than four decades, the indisputable fact that nursing homes care for a wide \nrange of resident populations with greatly divergent needs renders a one-size-fits-all \napproach manifestly inappropriate.  The Final Rule is an unjustified about-face from \nthat  longstanding  agency  position,  which  has  engendered  significant  reliance \ninterests.   \n9.  Those problems are only exacerbated by the irrational and unattainable \nstaffing levels that the Final Rule imposes.  As CMS openly acknowledges, its new \nmandates “exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all” of the \n38 States (plus the District of Columbia) that have adopted such requirements, and \nwill  require  increased  staffing  “in  more  than  79  percent  of  nursing  facilities \nnationwide.”  Id. at 40877.  Setting one-size-fits-all staffing requirements that will \nrequire some four-fifths of the nation’s nursing homes to hire additional personnel, \neven though almost no state has deemed those higher levels necessary in light of its \nparticular local conditions, and CMS itself has found that most nursing homes are \nalready providing more-than-adequate care with their present staffing levels, is the \nheight of arbitrary and capricious agency action.   \n10.  Still worse, CMS failed to adequately account for the ongoing shortage \nof RNs and NAs—a shortage that will be exacerbated by the artificial demand that \nthe  agency’s  mandate  will  produce  nationwide,  making  compliance  practically \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 6 of 56   PageID 6\n \nimpossible in many parts of the country.  Texas is a case in point: The Final Rule \nestimates that nursing homes in Texas will need to hire about 2,579 additional RNs, \nrepresenting an increase of 46.1% over current staffing, as well as 7,887 additional \nNAs, for an increase of 28.4%.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40957, 40976-80.  Texas simply \ndoes not have enough RNs and NAs to sustain these massive increases.  On the other \nhand, Texas has a relatively high proportion of licensed vocational nurses (“LVNs”),1 \nbut the Final Rule largely ignores their important contributions to resident care.  \nFurther,  the  Final  Rule  will  have  a  disproportionate  impact  on  smaller,  rural \nfacilities, which will struggle to compete with larger, better-funded urban facilities \nvying to attract new hires from the limited pool of RNs and NAs.  See AHCA \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  21,  31  (Nov.  6,  2023),  (“AHCA  Cmt.”), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-43877.2 \n \n1 Most states use the term “licensed practical nurse” (“LPN”), but Texas and \nCalifornia use the term LVN.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 22720, 22790 (Apr. 15, 2022).  LPNs \nand LVNs generally have 1-2 years of postsecondary education, e.g., an associate’s \ndegree, whereas NAs generally have only a high school diploma and have completed \na state certification program.  See id. \n2 See also, e.g., Elizabeth Dougherty, If You Build It: Rural Hospitals Are Closing, \nbut Those That Remain Are Reshaping and Innovating, Harvard Medicine: Rural \nHealth Issue, Spring 2017 (“Approximately 77 percent of rural countries in the \nUnited States are so-called medical deserts, owing to a shortage of primary care \nprofessionals.”); Lina Khan, Q&A with Lina Khan, Chair of the U.S. Federal Trade \nCommission and Mark Glick, Professor of Economics at the University of Utah, \n2023 Utah L. Rev. 757, 763 (2023) (“[T]he stakes are particularly dire, given that \nwe can see the emergence of healthcare deserts, like in rural communities with high \nprices and staffing shortages. I mean this is really life and death stuff.”).  \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 7 of 56   PageID 7\n \n11.  Even  if  nursing  homes  could  somehow  find  enough  qualified \njobseekers to meet CMS’s arbitrary RN and NA thresholds, they are in no position \nto absorb the annual costs of doing so, which by CMS’s own (unduly low) estimate \nwill amount to over $5 billion each year. \n12.  To be clear, all agree that nursing homes need an adequate supply of \nwell-trained  staff.    But  imposing  a  nationwide,  multi-billion-dollar,  unfunded \nmandate at a time when nursing homes are already struggling with staffing shortages \nand financial constraints will only make the situation worse.  If CMS’s new standards \nare permitted to take effect, hundreds of nursing homes will likely be forced to \ndownsize or close their doors entirely.  That threatens to displace tens of thousands \nof nursing home residents from their current facilities, while forcing countless other \nseniors and family members to wait longer, search farther, and pay more for the care \nthey need.  The Final Rule thus promises to be a nightmare not only for owners and \noperators of nursing homes, but also for the vulnerable residents they serve, in direct \nderogation of CMS’s statutory mandate.   \n13.  In  short,  the  staffing  requirements  in  the  Final  Rule  flunk  basic \nprinciples of administrative law at every turn.  Plaintiffs respectfully seek a judicial \ndeclaration that the 24/7 RN requirement and all three HPRD requirements exceed \nCMS’s statutory authority and are arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 8 of 56   PageID 8\n \nand an order setting aside those requirements and permanently enjoining Defendants \nfrom enforcing them.  \nTHE PARTIES \n14.  Plaintiff American Health Care Association (“AHCA”) is the largest \nassociation  in  the  United  States  representing  long-term  and  post-acute  care \nproviders,  with  a  membership  of  more  than  14,000  facilities.    It  maintains  its \nprincipal place of business in Washington, DC.  Many of AHCA’s member facilities \nparticipate in both Medicare and Medicaid, while some participate only in Medicare \nand some participate only in Medicaid.  AHCA brings this action on behalf of its \nmember facilities, to prevent the economic and other injuries that the Final Rule will \ncause them absent judicial relief. \n15.  Plaintiff  Texas  Health  Care  Association  (“THCA”)  is  the  largest \nassociation of long-term care providers in the State of Texas.  It maintains its \nprincipal place of business at 1108 Lavaca Street, Suite 500, Austin, TX 78701.  \nTHCA represents several hundred licensed non-profit and for-profit skilled nursing \nfacilities, specialized rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living facilities in Texas.  \nMany of THCA’s member facilities participate in both Medicare and Medicaid, \nwhile some participate only in Medicare and some participate only in Medicaid.  \nTHCA brings this action on behalf of its member facilities, to prevent the economic \nand other injuries that the Final Rule will cause them absent judicial relief. \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 9 of 56   PageID 9\n \n16.  Plaintiff Arbrook Plaza is a nursing facility that participates in both \nMedicare and Medicaid.  Arbrook Plaza is a member of AHCA and THCA, with its \nprincipal place of business at 401 W Arbrook Blvd, Arlington, TX 76014. \n17.  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District is a political subdivision of the State \nof Texas, located in Lipscomb County.  See Tex. Spec. Dist. Code §§1003.003, \n1003.004.  Among other things, Booker Hospital District operates Twin Oaks Manor \n(“Twin Oaks”), a nursing facility serving residents of rural Lipscomb County, with \nits principal place of business at 112 Pioneer Drive, Booker, TX 79005.  Twin Oaks \nparticipates in Medicaid but not Medicare.  \n18.  Plaintiff Harbor Lakes Nursing and Rehabilitation Center (“Harbor \nLakes”) is a long-term care facility that participates in both Medicare and Medicaid.  \nHarbor Lakes is a member of AHCA and THCA, with its principal place of business \nat 1300 2nd Street, Granbury, TX 76048. \n19.  Defendant  Xavier  Becerra  is  the  Secretary  of  the  United  States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  Defendant Becerra oversees \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs and approved the Final Rule at issue in this \nlitigation.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 41,000.  Defendant Becerra is sued in his official \ncapacity only. \n20.  Defendant HHS is a federal agency organized under the laws of the \nUnited States.  It is responsible for administering federal healthcare policy and is the \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 10 of 56   PageID 10\n \ncabinet-level department of which the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”) is a part. \n21.  Defendant Chiquita Brooks-LaSure is the Administrator of CMS and is \nsued in her official capacity only.   \n22.  Defendant CMS is a federal agency organized under the laws of the \nUnited States.  It is responsible for the federal government’s administration of \nMedicare and Medicaid. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n23.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §1331 and \nhas authority to grant the relief requested under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§701-706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201-2202.   \n24.  While Congress has restricted federal-question jurisdiction over claims \nthat arise under only the Medicare Act, see 42 U.S.C. §1395ii, that provision does \nnot apply to the present lawsuit for two independent reasons.  First, §1395ii does not \nbar facilities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid from bringing a pre-\nenforcement challenge that “arises under both Acts,” “has an independent basis in \nthe Medicaid Act[,] and is not inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits \nunder the Medicare Act.”  Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. Becerra, 995 F.3d 305, 312 (2d \nCir. 2021); accord Texas v. Becerra, 575 F.Supp.3d 701, 712 (N.D. Tex. 2021) \n(Kacsmaryk, J.).  Second, §1395ii does not apply to entities that participate only in \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 11 of 56   PageID 11\n \nMedicaid (and not Medicare), as their challenges indisputably arise only under the \nMedicaid Act.  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District operates a Medicaid-only facility \n(namely, Twin Oaks), and Plaintiffs AHCA and THCA have several members who \nlikewise participate only in Medicaid. \n25.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e) because (1) the Defendants \nare federal agencies and federal officers sued in their official capacity; (2) Plaintiffs \nArbrook Plaza, Booker Hospital District, and Harbor Lakes reside in this District; \nand (3) a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this \nDistrict. \nBACKGROUND \nA.   Overview of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs \n26.  In  1965,  Congress  created  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs \nthrough amendments to the Social Security Act.  See generally Pub. L. No. 89-97, \n79 Stat. 286 (July 30, 1965).  Medicare is a federal program that provides health \ninsurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as those with certain disabilities or \nconditions.  See 42 U.S.C. §1395c.  Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that \nprovides health insurance to low-income individuals.  See id. §§1396-1, 1396a.   \n27.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicare must meet the \nstatutory requirements for “skilled nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. §1395i-\n3.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicaid must meet the largely parallel \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 12 of 56   PageID 12\n \nset of statutory requirements for “nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. §1396r.  \nCollectively, skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities are referred to as “long-\nterm care” (“LTC”) facilities.  See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 22720, 22790 (Apr. 15, 2022).   \n28.  CMS  has  promulgated  a  single  set  of  consolidated  Medicare  and \nMedicaid  regulations  that  apply  to  all  LTC  facilities  that  participate  in  either \nprogram, or both.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.1.  More than 97% of nursing homes in the \nUnited States participate in at least one of the two programs.3 \nB.  Historical Federal Regulation of Nursing Home Staffing \n29.  For more than half a century, Congress—not CMS or its predecessors—\nhas taken the lead in setting staffing requirements for nursing homes that participate \nin the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  In 1972, Congress amended the Social \nSecurity Act to require all “skilled nursing facilities” (“SNFs”) participating in either \nor both programs to “provide[] 24-hour nursing service which is sufficient to meet \nnursing needs in accordance with the [facility’s patient care] policies” and to have \n“at  least  one  registered  professional  nurse  employed  full  time.”    42  U.S.C. \n§1395x(j)(6)  (1976)  (Medicare);  see  id.  §1396a(a)(28)  (1976)  (requiring  state \nMedicaid plans to define “skilled nursing facility” by reference to the Medicare \n \n3 See Nat’l Center for Health Stats., U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Post-\nacute and Long-term Care Providers and Services Users in the United States, 2017-\n2018, at 9-10 (2022) (stating that 97.8% of nursing facilities are certified under \nMedicare and 95.4% are certified under Medicaid). \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 13 of 56   PageID 13\n \ndefinition).  Congress empowered the Secretary to waive these staffing requirements \n“to the extent they … require that any skilled nursing facility engage the services of \na registered professional nurse for more than 40 hours a week,” but only with respect \nto SNFs in rural areas that met enumerated conditions.  See Pub. L. No. 92-603, \n§267, 86 Stat. 1329, 1450 (Oct. 30, 1972). \n30.  In  1973,  the  Social  Security  Administration  (“SSA”)  proposed \nregulations  that  mirrored  Congress’  decisions  on  nursing  home  staffing \nrequirements.  See 38 Fed. Reg. 18620 (July 12, 1973) (SNFs).  Just like the statute, \nthese proposed regulations required SNFs to provide “24-hour nursing service which \nis sufficient to meet nursing needs in accordance with the [facility’s patient care] \npolicies” and at least one “qualified registered nurse employed full-time”—i.e., \n“during the day tour of duty 5 days a week.”  Id. at 18625.  During the notice-and-\ncomment period, however, the agency received comments urging it to deviate from \nCongress’ approach by requiring all nursing homes to maintain “a specific ratio of \nnursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, 1974). \n31.  The  agency  considered  and  expressly  rejected  that  one-size-fits-all \napproach, explaining that “the variation from facility to facility in the composition \nof its nursing staff, physical layout, patient needs[,] and the services necessary to \nmeet those needs precludes setting such a figure.”  Id.  The agency also expressed \nconcern that “[a] minimum ratio could result in all facilities striving only to reach \n12 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 14 of 56   PageID 14\n \nthat minimum and could result in other facilities hiring unneeded staff to satisfy an \narbitrary ratio.”  Id. \n32.  In 1980, HHS took over the administration of Medicare and Medicaid.  \nIt  promptly  “propos[ed]  a  general  revision”  of  the  regulations  governing  SNF \nparticipation in Medicare and Medicaid.  See generally 45 Fed. Reg. 47368 (July 14, \n1980).  Consistent with SSA’s approach in the 1974 rulemaking, HHS declined to \npropose “any nursing staff ratios or minimum number of nursing hours per patient \nper day.”  Id. at 47371.  Instead, it proposed “retain[ing] the language in the existing \nregulations,” which closely tracked the governing statutes.  Id.; see also id. at 47378 \n(requiring “24-hour nursing service with a sufficient number of qualified nursing \npersonnel to meet the total nursing needs of the patient,” as well as “a registered \nnurse  full-time,  7  days  a  week  on  the  day  shift”).   At  the  same  time,  HHS \nacknowledged that “[s]ome States ha[d] chosen to employ [quantitative staffing] \nstandards,” invited them to share their experiences, and announced its intention “to \nundertake a study on this subject.”  Id. at 47371-72. \n33.  As HHS later acknowledged, the agency’s proposed overhaul of the \nSNF regulations in 1980 was “surrounded by controversy” and “met with strong \nopposition from a variety of sources.”  52 Fed. Reg. 38582, 38583 (Oct. 16, 1987).  \nIn response, Congress adopted legislation expressly prohibiting HHS from using any \nappropriated funds to finalize the proposed rule “prior to [its] receipt of revised cost \n13 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 15 of 56   PageID 15\n \nestimates” and a “General Accounting Office evaluation of the[ir] impact.” Pub. L. \nNo. 96-536, §119, 94 Stat. 3166 (Dec. 16, 1980).  The proposed rule was never \nfinalized,  but  HHS  nevertheless  followed  through  on  its  plan  to  explore  the \npossibility of minimum-staffing standards, commissioning a multi-year study by the \nInstitute of Medicine (“IoM”).  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 38583. \n34.  The  IoM  study  ratified  the  agency’s  longstanding  decision  not  to \nimpose a one-size-fits-all staffing standard on America’s nursing homes.  See Inst. \nof Med., Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes 101-03 (Mar. 1986), \nhttps://archive.ph/KFNCi.   The  study  emphasized  the  importance  of  recruiting, \nretaining, and supporting adequate numbers of nursing staff, but concluded that \n“prescribing simple staffing ratios clearly is inappropriate.”  Id. at 102.  It reached \nthis  conclusion  in  part  because  of  “the  complexities  of  case  mix”—that  is, \nindividuals within a single facility have “widely differing needs,” and some facilities \nhave a much “larger proportion of heavy-care residents” than other facilities.  Id. at \n102-03.    The  study  noted  the  possibility  of  “prescribing  sophisticated  staffing \nstandards” that would account for such complexities—e.g., by using “algorithms … \nto estimate amounts of nursing time needed by residents that are based on functional \nassessment scores and requirements for special care needs”—but found that this was \nnot feasible at the time.  Id. at 102. \n14 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 16 of 56   PageID 16\n \n35.  In October 1987, HHS again recognized the pitfalls of one-size-fits-all \nstaffing standards in a proposed rule stemming from the results of the IoM study.  \nSee 52 Fed. Reg. at 38586.  At the time, Congress had defined “intermediate care \nfacilities” (“ICFs”) as a class of institutions serving individuals who “require care \nand services (above the level of room and board)” but “do not require the degree of \ncare and treatment which a hospital or [SNF] is designed to provide.”  42 U.S.C. \n§1396d(c)  (1982).   Although  the  IoM  study  recommended  extending  the  SNF \nrequirement of 24-hour nursing services to ICFs, HHS was hesitant to do so.  HHS \nexplained that it “wish[ed] to provide maximum flexibility for staffing and to avoid \nrequiring 24 hour nurse staffing if there are cases in which the needs of the residents \ncan be met through the use of other personnel.”  52 Fed. Reg. at 38586.  HHS also \nexpressed “concern[] that some facilities would have difficulty in recruiting the \nnurses necessary to meet the requirement and d[id] not wish to create a situation in \nwhich needed nursing home beds are unavailable to program beneficiaries because \nfacilities cannot meet staffing requirements.”  Id.  Despite these qualms, HHS issued \na proposed rule that contemplated extending the existing SNF staffing requirements \nto ICFs, such that both types of facilities “would be required to have a sufficient \nnumber of licensed nurses and other personnel on a 24 hour a day basis, including a \nregistered nurse on duty on the day shift at least 8 hours a day, 7 days a week.”  Id.  \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 17 of 56   PageID 17\n \n36.  In  December  1987—less  than  three  months  after  HHS  issued  the \nproposed rule—Congress stepped in once again, enacting extensive revisions to the \nstatutory requirements for nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid.  \nSee Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, 101 Stat. \n1330 (Dec. 22, 1987) (“OBRA ’87”)).  With respect to Medicaid, Congress replaced \nthe two-level framework of SNFs and ICFs with a single definition of “nursing \nfacilities” (“NFs”), while retaining the term “SNF” in the Medicare context.4  See id. \n§4211(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-183 to 1330-203.  Congress then imposed substantively \nidentical staffing requirements on both SNFs and NFs (collectively known as LTC \nfacilities), requiring each such facility to (1) “provide 24-hour licensed nursing \nservice which is sufficient to meet [the] nursing needs of its residents”; and (2) \n“employ the services of a registered professional nurse at least during the day tour \nof duty (of at least 8 hours a day) 7 days a week.”  Id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-\n161  (SNF  requirement);  accord  id.  §4211(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330-186  (NF \nrequirement). \n37.  Congress  further  demonstrated  its  intent  to  address  nursing  home \nstaffing through legislation—rather than agency regulation—by enacting detailed \nrules for when the Secretary may waive the staffing requirements for SNFs, and \n \n4 OBRA ’87 redefined “intermediate care facilities” as institutions for individuals \nwith intellectual disabilities.  See Pub. L. No. 100-203, §4201(e), (h), 101 Stat. at \n1330-203 to 1330-207. \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 18 of 56   PageID 18\n \nslightly different rules for when a State may waive the staffing requirements for NFs.  \nCompare id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-163, with id. §4211(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-\n186.  Congress made both types of waivers subject to annual review and renewal.  \nSee id.; accord id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-163.  And Congress revisited the \nwaiver issue less than three years later, amending both provisions so that when a \nwaiver is granted, notice must be given to facility residents, members of their \nimmediate  families,  and  relevant  state  authorities.    See  Omnibus  Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, §§4008(h), 4801(a), 104 Stat. \n1388, 1388-49, 1388-211 (Nov. 5, 1990) (“OBRA ’90”).   \n38.  Congress underscored its intent to control nursing home staffing via \nlegislation by instructing the Secretary to “conduct a study and report to Congress \nno later than January 1, 1992, on the appropriateness of establishing minimum \ncaregiver to resident ratios and minimum supervisor to caregiver ratios for [LTC \nfacilities],” and to “include in such study recommendations regarding appropriate \nminimum ratios.”  Pub. L. No. 101-508, §4801(e)(17), 104 Stat. at 1388-218.  HHS \nfailed to comply with Congress’ instructions, however, until 2002—ten years after \nthe statutory deadline.  When the Secretary finally sent Congress a responsive letter, \nhe reported that the study “d[id] not provide enough information to address the \nquestion posed by Congress regarding the appropriateness of establishing minimum \n17 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 19 of 56   PageID 19\n \nratios.”5  The Secretary’s letter went on to express “serious reservations about the \nreliability of staffing data at the nursing home level and with the feasibility of \nestablishing staff ratios to improve quality given the variety of quality measures used \nand the perpetual shifting of such measures.”  Id.  The Secretary also observed that \nthe study “d[id] not fully address important related issues,” including “the reality of \ncurrent nursing shortages.”  Id.  In light of the Secretary’s report, Congress declined \nto make further changes to the statutory staffing requirements for nursing homes that \nparticipate in Medicare or Medicaid.   \nC.  Statutory Staffing Requirements for Nursing Homes \n39.  The statutory staffing requirements for nursing homes have remained \nsubstantively unchanged since 1990.  They provide, in relevant part, that each \nfacility must (1) “provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to \nmeet the nursing needs of its residents”; and (2) “use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  42 U.S.C. \n§1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n \n5 Letter from Tommy G. Thompson, Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., to J. \nDennis Hastert, Speaker of House of Representatives 1 (Mar. 19, 2002) (“Thompson \nLetter”), reprinted in Office of Asst. Sec’y for Planning & Evaluation, Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs., State Experiences with Minimum Nursing Staff Ratios for \nNursing Facilities: Findings from Case Studies of Eight States app. 1 (Nov. 2003), \nhttps://archive.ph/wip/KQWPt.   \n18 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 20 of 56   PageID 20\n \n40.  For Medicaid participants, the State in which they operate may waive \nboth the requirement that a given facility “provide 24-hour licensed nursing services \nwhich are sufficient to meet the needs of its residents” and the requirement to use \nthe services of an RN for at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 days a week, if: \n(I) the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that the \nfacility has been unable, despite diligent efforts (including offering \nwages at the community prevailing rate for nursing facilities), to recruit \nappropriate personnel, \n \n(II) the State determines that a waiver of the requirement will not \nendanger the health or safety of individuals staying in the facility, \n \n(III) the State finds that, for any such periods in which licensed nursing \nservices are not available, a registered professional nurse or a physician \nis obligated to respond immediately to telephone calls from the facility, \n \n(IV) the State agency granting a waiver of such requirements provides \nnotice  of  the  waiver  to  the  State  long-term  care  ombudsman \n(established under section 307(a)(12) of the Older Americans Act of \n1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the \nmentally ill and the mentally retarded, and \n \n(V) the nursing facility that is granted such a waiver by a State notifies \nresidents of the facility (or, where appropriate, the guardians or legal \nrepresentatives  of  such  residents)  and  members  of  their  immediate \nfamilies of the waiver. \n \nId. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(ii).  Further, “[i]f the Secretary determines that a State has \nshown a clear pattern and practice of allowing waivers in the absence of diligent \nefforts by facilities to meet the staffing requirements, the Secretary shall assume and \nexercise the authority of the State to grant waivers.”  42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(iii). \n19 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 21 of 56   PageID 21\n \n41.  For Medicare participants (i.e., SNFs), the Secretary may waive the \nrequirement to use the services of an RN for at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 \ndays a week, if the Secretary finds that: \n(I) the facility is located in a rural area and the supply of skilled nursing \nfacility services in such area is not sufficient to meet the needs of \nindividuals residing therein, \n \n(II) the facility has one full-time registered professional nurse who is \nregularly on duty at such facility 40 hours a week, \n \n(III)  the  facility  either  has  only  patients  whose  physicians  have \nindicated (through physicians’ orders or admission notes) that each such \npatient does not require the services of a registered nurse or a physician \nfor  a  48-hour  period,  or  has  made  arrangements  for  a  registered \nprofessional nurse or a physician to spend such time at such facility as \nmay be indicated as necessary by the physician to provide necessary \nskilled nursing services on days when the regular full-time registered \nprofessional nurse is not on duty, \n \n(IV) the Secretary provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term \ncare ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12) of the Older \nAmericans Act of 1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the \nState for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and \n \n(V) the facility that is granted such a waiver notifies residents of the \nfacility (or, where appropriate, the guardians or legal representatives of \nsuch residents) and members of their immediate families of the waiver. \n \nId. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(ii). \n42.  Shortly  after  Congress  enacted  these  statutory  standards  (through \nOBRA ’87 and OBRA ’90), HHS promulgated consolidated Medicare and Medicaid \nregulations that respect Congress’ judgment by essentially parroting the statutory \n20 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 22 of 56   PageID 22\n \ntext.  See 56 Fed. Reg. 48826, 48874 (Sept. 26, 1991); see also 54 Fed. Reg. 5316 \n(Feb. 2, 1989).   \n43.  For  more  than  30  years,  CMS  faithfully  administered  the  staffing \nstandards  established  by  Congress.    See  42  C.F.R.  §483.35(a)-(b)  (2016).   As \nrecently as 2016, CMS expressly rejected “many comment[s]” urging it to deviate \nfrom the statutory standards by “establish[ing] and requir[ing] minimum staffing \nlevels and requir[ing] a registered nurse to be in the LTC facility 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week.”  81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68754 (Oct. 4, 2016).  While CMS claimed \n(without explanation) that it had the statutory authority to impose new standards and \nsuggested that it might do so through future rulemaking, it reiterated its longstanding \nview that “a ‘one size fits all’ approach” to nursing home staffing is inappropriate.  \nId. at 68755.   \n44.  In that 2016 rulemaking, CMS emphasized its ongoing “concerns about \n[imposing] mandatory ratios” or requiring “a 24/7 RN presence,” id. at 68756; see \nid. at 68754-56, 68758.  For example, CMS felt it was unable to “determin[e] a \n‘right’ number for any staffing ratio,” id. at 68576, because “LTC facilities are varied \nin their structure and in their resident populations,” id. at 68758; see also 80 Fed. \nReg. 42168, 42201 (July 16, 2015) (emphasizing the importance of “taking acuity \nlevels into account”).  CMS instead opined that the “focus” of its regulations “should \nbe on the skill sets and specific competencies of assigned staff to provide the nursing \n21 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 23 of 56   PageID 23\n \ncare a resident needs rather than a static number of staff or hours of nursing care.”  \n80 Fed. Reg. at 42201; accord id. at 42200 (“A focus on numbers of nurses fails to \naddress the influence of other staffing factors (for example, turnover and agency \nstaff use), training and experience of staff, and care organization and management.”).   \n45.  CMS also cautioned “that establishing a specific number of staff or \nhours of nursing care could result in staffing to that number rather than to the needs \nof the resident population.”  Id. at 42201.  Finally, CMS expressed concern that \nrequiring 24/7 RN presence in every LTC facility “could negatively impact the \ndevelopment of innovative care options, particular[ly] in smaller, more home-like \nsettings,” and that “geographic disparity in supply could make such a mandate \nparticularly challenging in some rural and underserved areas.”  81 Fed. Reg. at \n68755.   \nD.  The Final Rule \n46.  Things  changed  dramatically  in  February  2022,  when  the  Biden \nAdministration  announced  its  intention  to  “establish  a  minimum  nursing  home \nstaffing  requirement.”    White  House,  FACT  SHEET:  Protecting  Seniors  by \nImproving Safety and Quality of Care in the Nation’s Nursing Homes (Feb. 28, \n2022), https://archive.ph/wip/xOXxa (capitalization altered).  The Administration \ntasked CMS with (1) “conduct[ing] a new research study to determine the level and \ntype of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care”; and (2) “issu[ing] proposed \n22 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 24 of 56   PageID 24\n \nrules” by February 2023 setting forth “minimum standards for staffing adequacy that \nnursing homes must meet.”  Id.  Shortly thereafter, CMS commissioned a private \nfirm, Abt Associates, to perform the staffing study. \n47.  The staffing study was not published until June 2023, several months \nafter the Administration’s self-imposed deadline for issuing a proposed minimum-\nstaffing rule.6  And when the study finally was released, it did not support the \nAdministration’s desired conclusion.  For example, one of its “key findings” was \nthat  while  recent  literature  indicates  that  higher  staffing  levels  are  generally \ncorrelated with better outcomes, “it does not provide a clear evidence basis for \nsetting a minimum staffing level.”  Abt Study at xi.  The study also concluded that \nthere is “no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or ‘cliff’ \nbelow which quality and safety steeply decline.”  Id. \n48.  The study noted that many stakeholders, from nursing home owners \nand operators to nursing staff interviewees, “emphasized that workforce shortages \nand current hiring challenges could present barriers to nursing home compliance \nwith a new federal staffing requirement.”  Id. at xxi; see also, e.g., id. at xii, xiv, 19, \n31-32.  But the report ultimately dodged the crucial question of whether it would be \nfeasible to implement a nationwide minimum staffing requirement—despite the \n \n6 See generally Abt Associates, Nursing Home Staffing Study: Comprehensive \nReport (June 2023) (“Abt Study”), https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nursing-\nhome-staffing-study-final-report-appendix-june-2023.pdf. \n23 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 25 of 56   PageID 25\n \nnational workforce shortage, uneven workforce distribution, and limited access to \ntraining and education programs—on the ground that it “was not a workforce study.”  \nId. at xxi.   \n49.  The study also cited a wealth of evidence and feedback confirming that \nit makes no sense to mandate staff-to-patient ratios without accounting for variations \nin resident acuity.  See, e.g., id. at 2 (“Nursing homes with higher-acuity or more \nclinically complex residents can require a higher level of staffing to meet resident \nneeds.”); id. at 17 (“Existing literature confirms the importance of resident acuity in \ndetermining staffing needs.”); id. at 26 (“Direct care respondents (RNs, LPNs, nurse \naides) consistently noted that resident acuity was more important than the actual \nnumber  of  assigned  residents  in  determining  whether  their  assignments  were \nreasonable.”).  That should have come as no surprise to CMS, as the agency and its \npredecessors repeatedly embraced that very reasoning in rejecting calls to impose \nstaff-to-patient ratios from the early 1970s through 2016.  See, e.g., 39 Fed. Reg. at \n2239 (explaining that “variation” in “patient needs and the services necessary to \nmeet those needs precludes setting” “a specific ratio of nursing staff to patients”); \n80 Fed. Reg. at 42201 (emphasizing the importance of “taking acuity levels into \naccount”).   \n50.  None  of  that  deterred  CMS  from  forging  ahead  with  the \nAdministration’s predetermined plan.  On September 6, 2023, CMS published a \n24 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 26 of 56   PageID 26\n \nproposed rule announcing new minimum staffing standards for LTC facilities.  See \n88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (Sept. 6, 2023).  In response, AHCA, THCA, and a host of other \nstakeholders submitted detailed comments urging CMS not to adopt its proposed \nstandards.  Stakeholders opposed to the proposed rule included: \n  the  Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission  (“MedPAC”),  a \nnonpartisan  independent  legislative  branch  agency  that  provides \nCongress with analysis and policy advice on the Medicare program; \n \n  LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of services for the \naging and other mission-driven organizations serving older adults;  \n \n  the American Hospital Association, which represents and serves nearly \n5,000  hospitals  and  health  care  systems  and  43,000  individual \nmembers;  \n \n  the  National  Rural  Health  Association,  a  national  nonprofit \norganization with thousands of members across the United States;  \n \n  the Catholic Health Association of the United States, which is made up \nof more than 600 Catholic hospitals and 1,600 long-term care and other \nhealth facilities in all 50 states;  \n \n  Lutheran Services in America, a network of about 300 Lutheran health \nand human services nonprofit organizations serving 1,400 communities \nacross the country;  \n \n  the Association of Jewish Aging Services, a nonprofit that promotes and \nsupports elder services in the context of Jewish values; and  \n \n  the National Association of State Veterans Homes, which works to \npromote and enhance the quality of care that veterans receive.   \n \n51.  These and other commenters repeatedly explained that the proposed \nstandards exceeded CMS’s statutory authority, contravened Congress’ considered \n25 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 27 of 56   PageID 27\n \ndecision to impose qualitative rather than quantitative staffing standards, failed to \naccount for the widely varying circumstances and needs of the thousands of LTC \nfacilities across the country, and threatened to force nursing homes to close their \ndoors and deprive residents of much-needed care.   \n52.  CMS nevertheless pressed forward.  On May 10, 2024, the agency \npublished the Final Rule in the Federal Register.  See Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms;  Minimum  Staffing  Standards  for  Long-Term  Care  Facilities  and \nMedicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, 89 Fed. Reg. 40876.  The \nFinal  Rule  imposes  two  mandatory  minimum-staffing  requirements  on  LTC \nfacilities, the second of which includes three mandatory sub-parts. \n53.  24/7  RN  Requirement.  First, the Final Rule replaces the statutory \nrequirement that LTC facilities “use the services of [an RN] for at least 8 consecutive \nhours a day, 7 days a week,” 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i), with a new requirement to “have a registered nurse (RN) onsite 24 \nhours per day, for 7 days a week that is available to provide direct resident care,” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40997.  In other words, it triples the required hours per day of RN \nservices. \n54.  HPRD  Requirements.    Second,  the  Final  Rule  departs  from  the \nqualitative  statutory  requirement  that  LTC  facilities  “provide  24-hour  licensed \nnursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents,” 42 \n26 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 28 of 56   PageID 28\n \nU.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i), by instead imposing \nthree rigid quantitative requirements: \n  “The facility must meet or exceed a minimum of 3.48 hours per resident \nday for total nurse staffing,” which must include— \n  “[a] minimum of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses”; and \n  “[a] minimum of 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 40996. \n55.  The  Final  Rule  also  extends  the  statutory  waiver  for  Medicaid \nparticipants (see supra ¶40) to the new 24/7 RN requirement and the 0.55 RN HPRD \nrequirement, but not the 3.48 total nurse HPRD or 2.45 NA HPRD requirements.  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40997-98.  The Final Rule likewise extends the statutory waiver for \nMedicare participants (see supra ¶41) to the new 24/7 RN requirement, but not the \nHPRD requirements.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40997-98.  Neither of these statutory waivers \nwill provide any widespread relief from the Final Rule’s rigid requirements; in fact, \ndespite the long-running, nationwide shortage of nursing staff, less than 0.2% of \nAHCA’s member facilities have been able to obtain those waivers to date as to the \nexisting statutory requirements.  \n56.  The Final Rule also creates a new, regulatory “hardship exemption” that \ncan be used to obtain a partial exemption from the new 24/7 RN requirement and an \nexemption from one or more of the HPRD requirements.  See id. at 40998.

Notably, the criteria that CMS chose to govern its newly-invented \n“hardship exemption” differ substantially from the statutory criteria that Congress \nhas set for the statutory waiver scheme.  See supra ¶¶40-41. \n28 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 30 of 56   PageID 30\n \n57.  The  agency’s  new  “hardship  exemption”  fails  to  provide  regulated \nfacilities with meaningful relief, as the Final Rule emphasizes that this exemption \n(like  the  existing  statutory  waivers)  will  be  “available  only  in  limited \ncircumstances.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40877; accord id. at 40894.  Even if it obtained, \nmoreover, the “hardship exemption” for the new 24/7 RN requirement is only a \npartial one, as it provides only “an exemption of 8 hours a day”; in other words, a \nfacility that obtains such an exemption must still have an RN “onsite” and “available \nto provide direct resident care” for at least 16 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Id. at \n40997-98.  In addition, any facility that receives a hardship exemption from the 24/7 \nRN  requirement  “must  have  a  registered  nurse,  nurse  practitioner,  physician \nassistant, or physician available to respond immediately to telephone calls from the \nfacility” whenever there is no RN onsite.  Id. at 40997. \n58.  A facility may not obtain any “hardship exemption” if it has been \ndesignated a “Special Focus Facility,” which indicates that CMS has “identified [it] \nas having substantially failed to meet” applicable requirements of Medicare or \nMedicaid, see 42 U.S.C. §§1395i-3(f)(8), 1396r(f)(10); has received a citation from \nCMS within the past 12 months related to staffing-related issues; or has “failed to \nsubmit Payroll Based Journal data in accordance with [42 C.F.R.] § 483.70(p).”  89 \nFed.

The Final Rule’s policies are to be phased in over the next several years.  \nId. at 40913.  Facilities in non-rural areas must implement the 24/7 RN and the 3.48 \ntotal nurse HPRD requirements within 2 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 NA HPRD \nrequirements within 3 years.  Id.  Rural facilities must implement the 24/7 RN and \nthe 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirements within 3 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 \nNA HPRD requirements within 5 years.  Id.   \nE.  Harms to Plaintiffs and the Communities They Serve \n60.  CMS estimates that the Final Rule will cost LTC facilities more than $5 \nbillion per year (in 2021 dollars) after the phase-in period.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40970, \ntbl.22; see id. at 40949.  Separate analyses by LeadingAge and CliftonLarsonAllen \npredict that the costs will be even higher—around $7 billion per year.  See id. at \n40950.  Even under CMS’s unduly low estimate, LTC facilities are in no position to \ncope with this massive, unfunded mandate.  As AHCA explained in its comments on \nthe proposed rule, “nearly 60 percent of [LTC] facilities have negative operating \nmargins.”  AHCA Cmt.5.  For AHCA members that are already struggling to stay \nafloat, the Final Rule imposes additional costs that could force them to close their \ndoors for good. \n61.  Compounding the problem, CMS estimates that more than 79% of LTC \nfacilities in the United States—nearly four-fifths of all facilities—will have to find \nadditional staff in order to comply with the new minimum-staffing requirements, \n30 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 32 of 56   PageID 32\n \nwhich “exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40877.  On the national level, CMS projects that the Final Rule will \nrequire facilities to hire an additional 15,906 additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN \nrequirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement (a staffing increase of about 11.8%), \nplus an additional 77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement and 3.48 \ntotal nurse HPRD requirement (a staffing increase of about 17.2%).  See id. at 40958, \n40977-80.  These staffing increases will be practically impossible to attain, as LTC \nfacilities are already experiencing major challenges in finding qualified nursing staff \neven without the Final Rule’s massive artificial increase in demand.  Many of \nAHCA’s member facilities have vacant nursing positions that have been sitting open \nfor months due to a dearth of qualified candidates.  The long-term care workforce \nremains  about  125,000  workers  below  its  pre-pandemic  levels;  hundreds  of \nthousands of nurses are expected to retire or leave the profession in the coming years; \nand a shortage of nursing school faculty has contributed to a decrease in nursing \nprogram enrollment for the first time in more than two decades. \n62.  The  Final  Rule’s  adverse  effects  will  be  especially  pronounced  in \nTexas.  According to CMS, “Texas will need to hire the most [additional] RNs” of \nany state to meet the new staffing standards—approximately 653 RNs to comply \nwith the 24/7 RN requirement, plus another 1,926 RNs to comply with the 0.55 RN \nHPRD requirement.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40,957, 40,976-80.  That is a 46.1% increase in \n31 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 33 of 56   PageID 33\n \nthe number of RNs employed by LTC facilities in Texas.  See id.  Texas will require \napproximately 7,887 additional NAs to meet the other HPRD requirements, which \nrepresents an increase of 28.4%.  See id. at 40,978. 40,980.  As THCA explained in \nits  comments,  Texas  simply  does  not  have  the  manpower  to  implement  these \nrequirements, as it “is already short of thousands of RNs and []NAs.”  THCA \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  1  (Nov.  6,  2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-43368  (“THCA  Cmt.”).  \nAnd while LTC facilities in Texas employ nearly 60,000 LVNs—the second largest \nnumber of any State—the Final Rule does not allow hours worked by LPNs/LVNs \nto be counted toward the NA HPRD requirement, even though LPNs/LVNs complete \nmore education and training than NAs.  Cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40897 (noting that either \nRNs or LPNs/LVNs—but not NAs—can be used to meet the statutory requirement \nof 24-hour licensed nursing services).   \n63.  CMS acknowledges that Texas facilities alone will collectively need to \nspend nearly half a billion dollars per year to comply with these new requirements—\n$84 million on the 24/7 RN requirement, and another $409 million on the three \nHPRD requirements.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40958, 40960, 40983.  THCA members \nare simply unable to absorb these additional costs on top of the rising costs of care, \nchronic underfunding of Medicaid, and ongoing inflationary factors.  THCA Cmt.3. \n32 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 34 of 56   PageID 34\n \n64.  To make matters worse, CMS is imposing these massive burdens on \nthousands of LTC facilities that already provide high-quality care for their residents, \nand already comply with any state-law minimum staffing standards that their state \ngovernments have set in light of local conditions.  LTC facilities use a variety of \nstaffing blends to meet the unique needs of their resident populations, and many \nachieve above-average ratings on health inspections and quality measures even \nthough they do not satisfy CMS’s arbitrary new staffing requirements.  The named \nplaintiffs illustrate the point: \n  Plaintiff Arbrook Plaza has a 5-star overall rating from CMS, including \nquality measures that are “much above average” and health inspections \nthat are “above average.”  It delivers these results with an average of \n0.18 RN HPRD, 1.17 LVN HPRD, and 2.25 NA HPRD.  Even though \nArbrook Plaza receives high marks across the board in terms of resident \ncare, and already complies with the minimum-staffing standards set by \nTexas  law,  the  Final  Rule  will  force  it  to  begin  offering  24/7  RN \nservices, triple its RN HPRD, and significantly increase its NA HPRD.  \n \n  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District operates Twin Oaks, which has a 5-\nstar overall rating from CMS.  By CMS’s own account, Twin Oaks’ \nstaffing is “much above average” and its health inspections are “above \naverage.”  Twin Oaks is the only one of the named plaintiffs that is \ncurrently in compliance with CMS’s new HPRD requirements, and \nTwin  Oaks  is  also  in  full  compliance  with  the  minimum  staffing \nstandards set by Texas law.  Nevertheless, the Final Rule will require \nTwin Oaks to recruit and hire additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN \nrequirement—an extremely daunting task for a 61-bed facility located \nin one of the most rural parts of the Texas panhandle. \n \n  Plaintiff Harbor Lakes has a 5-star overall rating from CMS, including \nquality measures that are “much above average” and health inspections \nthat are “above average.”  It also meets the minimum-staffing standards \nestablished by Texas law.  Harbor Lakes is able to provide high-quality \n33 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 35 of 56   PageID 35\n \ncare thanks to a staffing mix that includes 1.1 HPRD of LVN services, \nwhich  is  well  above  the  national  average.    But  the  Final  Rule \nirrationally discounts (and largely ignores) the contributions of LVNs, \nand will therefore force Harbor Lakes to significantly increase its RN \nand NA staffing.  Despite its high quality ratings, the facility does not \ncurrently  meet  the  24/7  RN  requirement,  the  0.55  RN  HPRD \nrequirement, or the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement. \n \n65.  In sum, the Final Rule will impose a significant regulatory burden on \neach of these facilities, as well as thousands of other LTC facilities represented by \nAHCA and THCA.  That easily suffices to establish Article III standing.  See, e.g., \nDuarte ex rel. Duarte v. City of Lewisville, 759 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir. 2014) (“[I]f \na plaintiff is an object of a government regulation, then that plaintiff ordinarily has \nstanding to challenge that regulation.”).   \n66.  The harms imposed by the Final Rule extend even further.  More than \n500 nursing homes closed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and very few \nof them have reopened or been replaced by new facilities.  AHCA Cmt.5; see also \nTHCA Cmt.3 (noting that “[s]ince March 2020, 56 skilled nursing facilities have \nclosed” in Texas alone).  By imposing a massive, unfunded staffing mandate at a \ntime when there is already an inadequate supply of RNs and NAs, the Final Rule \nwill force scores of additional nursing homes to reduce their capacity or even shut \ndown entirely.  AHCA Cmt.7-8, 10; THCA Cmt.4.  This would have a hugely \ndetrimental  effect  on  access  to  long-term  care.    In  fact,  according  to \nCliftonLarsonAllen’s analysis, the Final Rule could cause nearly one quarter of \n34 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 36 of 56   PageID 36\n \nnursing home residents to be displaced from their current nursing home, while \nforcing countless other seniors and family members to wait longer, search farther, \nand pay more for the care they need.  AHCA Cmt.7.   \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \n(APA – Lack of Statutory Authority) \n67.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n68.  Like all administrative agencies, CMS is a “creature[] of statute,” and \naccordingly “possess[es] only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n \nof Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022); see also, e.g., La. Pub. \nServ. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (“[A]n agency literally has no \npower to act … unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”).  That well-\nestablished principle dooms the Final Rule, as Congress has not authorized CMS to \nimpose the 24/7 RN requirement or the HPRD requirements. \nA.  The 24/7 RN Requirement \n69.  Congress has specified the minimum amount of RN staffing necessary \nto participate in Medicaid or Medicare:  All LTC facilities “must use the services of \na registered professional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  \n42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).   \n35 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 37 of 56   PageID 37\n \n70.  The Final Rule impermissibly alters this statutory requirement in two \ndistinct ways.  First, it triples the hours of mandatory RN staffing, replacing the 8/7 \nRN requirement enacted by Congress with a mandate that all LTC facilities “must \nhave a registered nurse (RN) onsite 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.”  89 Fed. \nReg. at 40997.  Second, the Final Rule replaces the statutory requirement to “use the \nservices of” an RN, including in administrative or supervisory roles, with a new \nrequirement to have an RN “available to provide direct resident care.”  Id. \n71.  CMS  concedes  that  the  statutory  provisions  setting  forth  the  8/7 \nrequirement for RN staffing do not empower it to adopt the 24/7 RN requirement.  \nSee  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40891  (disclaiming  reliance  on  §§1395i-3(b)(4)(C)  and \n1396r(b)(4)(C) as source of statutory authority).  It could hardly be otherwise, as \neven in the heyday of “Chevron deference,” a statutory requirement of X was not an \ninvitation  for  the  agency  to  require  3X.    The  agency  nevertheless  asserts  that \n“various provisions” elsewhere in §§1395i-3 and 1396r contain “separate authority” \nfor this novel requirement, id. at 40879, 40890-91, pointing to provisions stating \nthat: \n  The Secretary may impose “such other requirements relating to the \nhealth and safety of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof \nas the Secretary may find necessary.”  42 U.S.C. §1396r(d)(4)(B); accord \n42 U.S.C. §1395i-3(d)(4)(B).  \n  An  LTC  facility  “must  provide  services  and  activities  to  attain  or \nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-\n36 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 38 of 56   PageID 38\n \nbeing of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care.”  42 \nU.S.C. §1396r(b)(2); accord 42 U.S.C. §1395i-3(b)(2). \n  An LTC facility “must care for its residents in such a manner and in such \nan environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the \nquality of life of each resident.” 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(1)(A); accord 42 \nU.S.C. §1395i-3(b)(1)(A). \n72.  None of these more general provisions supplies authority for replacing \nthe statutory 8/7 RN requirement with a regulatory 24/7 RN requirement.  It is well \nestablished that “[g]eneral language” in one part of a statute “will not be held to \napply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.”  E.g., \nRadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645-46 (2012) \n(quoting D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204, 208 (1932)).  Whatever \nthe scope of the Secretary’s general authority to impose “other requirements,” 42 \nU.S.C.  §§1395i-3(d)(4)(B),  1396r(d)(4)(B)  (emphasis  added),  and  flesh  out  the \n“services,” “activities,” and “care” that LTC facilities must provide, id. §§1395i-\n3(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), 1396r(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), it does not include the power to modify \nthe requirements specifically enacted by Congress.   \n73.  But that is exactly what the Final Rule does.  As CMS itself recognizes, \nthe Final Rule “revises” the statutory 8/7 RN requirement codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§§1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i), replacing it with CMS’s preferred 24/7 \nRN requirement.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40898.  That is not a decision that Congress \nleft open for CMS to make.  On the contrary, the Social Security Act itself confirms \n37 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 39 of 56   PageID 39\n \nthat the Secretary may not “publish ... rules and regulations” that are “inconsistent \nwith” provisions of the Act.  42 U.S.C. §1302(a); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 40897, \n40898-99 (acknowledging that detailed statutory scheme for waiving the 8/7 RN \nrequirement “can only be modified by legislation”).  The 24/7 RN requirement \nplainly flunks that test and must be set aside.  See 5 U.S.C. §706(2). \nB.  The HPRD Requirements \n74.  The same goes for the Final Rule’s HPRD requirements.  Congress has \nextensively considered whether to enact staff-to-patient ratios for LTC facilities, and \nCongress  specifically  chose  not  to  do  so.    Instead  of  a  rigid  one-size-fits-all \nquantitative requirement, Congress opted for a flexible qualitative standard:  An LTC \nfacility must provide nursing services “sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its \nresidents.”  42 U.S.C. 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n75.  The Final Rule impermissibly substitutes CMS’s current policy views \nfor Congress’ considered judgment and replaces a flexible standard with a rule of \nalmost comical rigidity and specificity.  By requiring “[a] minimum of 3.48 hours \nper  resident  day  for  total  nurse  staffing[,]  including  but  not  limited  to—(i) [a] \nminimum of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses; and (ii) [a] minimum \nof 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides,” it replaces the flexible standard that \nCongress consciously chose—which accommodates the wide variation in resident \nneeds across different facilities—with an inflexible mandate that each facility meet \n38 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 40 of 56   PageID 40\n \nan arbitrary numerical staffing threshold.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40996.  Moreover, the \nrequirement to have RN staffing of at least 0.55 HPRD is inconsistent with the \nstatutory requirement to have RN staffing for at least 8 consecutive hours per day—\nas illustrated by CMS’s felt need to extend the statutory waiver that applies to the \n8/7 RN requirement to not only the new 24/7 RN requirement but also the 0.55 RN \nHPRD requirement.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997.   \n76.  Once again, these are not choices Congress has authorized CMS to \nmake.  CMS does not rely on §1395i-3(b)(4)(C) or §1396r(b)(4)(C) as authority for \nthese new requirements.  It instead once again invokes the Secretary’s general \nauthority to impose “necessary” requirements relating to residents’ health and safety, \nas well as provisions requiring LTC facilities to “provide services to attain or \nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of \neach resident,” and “promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of \neach resident.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40879, 40890-91; see 42 U.S.C. §§1395i-3(b)(1)(A), \n(b)(2), (d)(4)(B); 1396r(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), (d)(4)(B).  But none of those provisions \nempowers CMS to impose rigid HPRD requirements for RNs, NAs, and total nursing \nstaff.  As explained, CMS’s general authority over Medicare and Medicaid does not \npermit it to modify “matter[s] specifically dealt with in another part of the same \nenactment.”  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, 566 U.S. at 646; see also 42 U.S.C. §1302(a) \n(Secretary may not promulgate regulations that are “inconsistent with” statutory \n39 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 41 of 56   PageID 41\n \nrequirements).  Congress squarely considered the question of what staffing levels to \nrequire from LTC facilities and the relative merits of a flexible standard and rigid \nrules,  and  it  chose  to  require  only  that  each  facility  maintain  staffing  levels \n“sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents.”  42 U.S.C. §§1396r(b)(4)(C), \n1395i-3(b)(4)(C).  That leaves no room for CMS to supersede Congress’ judgment \nwith its own arbitrary numerical requirements.  And the Secretary’s assertion that \none-size-fits all HPRD levels “are necessary for resident health, safety, and well-\nbeing,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40890, is flatly at odds with Congress’ determination that \nsufficient staffing levels should be determined by reference to the particularized \nneeds of each facility, based on its unique mix of residents with varying needs and \nlevels of acuity.   \n77.  Notably, the Final Rule makes clear that it will no longer be enough for \nan LTC facility to meet the statutory requirement to “provide 24-hour licensed \nnursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents” by \nusing any suitable combination of RNs, NAs, LPNs/LVNs, and other caregivers and \nsupport staff, 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C), as Congress chose to require by statute and \nas Arbrook Plaza, Twin Oaks, and Harbor Lakes currently do.  Instead, all LTC \nfacilities  will  now  be  required  comply  with  new,  one-size-fits-all  HPRD \nrequirements, even if “the facility assessment indicates that a lower HPRD [is \nsufficient] or that a 24/7 RN is not required to care for their resident population.”  89 \n40 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 42 of 56   PageID 42\n \nFed. Reg. at 40908.  CMS simply does not have the authority to override Congress’ \njudgment in this manner. \nC.  Major Questions Doctrine \n78.  The  history  of  Congress’  actions  in  this  area,  the  “breadth  of  the \nauthority” CMS now asserts, and “the economic and political significance” of that \nasserted authority further confirm that CMS does not have the power to impose these \nnew staffing mandates.  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022).   \n79.  By promulgating the Final Rule, CMS “adopt[ed] a regulatory program \nthat Congress ha[s] conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself.”  Id. at \n724.  For more than half a century, Congress—not CMS or its predecessors—has \ntaken the lead in setting staffing requirements for nursing homes that participate in \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs.  See supra ¶¶29-38.  And on the rare occasions \nwhen CMS has tried to take a more aggressive approach, Congress has stepped in to \ncurtail its efforts.  Most notably, Congress has twice acted to block major regulatory \nchanges affecting LTC facilities—first in 1980, when it prohibited HHS from using \nappropriated funds to publish final regulations, Pub. L. No. 96-536, §119, 94 Stat. \n3166; see supra ¶¶32-33, and again in 1987, when it terminated a rulemaking that \nproposed new staffing standards by extensively amending the statute, Pub. L. No. \n100-203,  101  Stat.  1330;  see  supra  ¶¶35-37.    A  few  years  later,  Congress \nunderscored its intent to govern nursing home staffing through legislation—not \n41 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 43 of 56   PageID 43\n \nagency regulation—by specifically instructing HHS to study potential minimum-\nstaffing requirements for nursing homes and provide a report with recommendations \nfor Congress to consider.  See supra ¶38.  Congress has not altered the statutory \nstaffing  requirements  for  LTC  facilities  since  1990,  and  the  relevant  agency \nregulations have mirrored those statutory standards for well over 3 decades.  See \nsupra ¶¶39-45.  All of that history belies any assertion that Congress intended to \ndelegate the issue to CMS. \n80.  The economic and political significance of these minimum-staffing \nrules likewise undermines CMS’s claim of regulatory authority.  By CMS’s own \nestimate, the Final Rule would require more than 79% of LTC facilities—nearly four \nout of every five facilities in the country—to increase their staffing levels.  89 Fed. \nReg.  at  40877.   All  told,  facilities  would  need  to  hire  approximately  15,906 \nadditional RNs (a staffing increase of about 11.8%) and 77,611 additional NAs (a \nstaffing increase of about 17.2%).  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40958, tbl.16; id. at 40977-\n80, tbls.25 & 26.  After the initial phase-in period, the Final Rule would cost over $5 \nbillion per year (in CY 2021 dollars)—nearly all of which would be borne by LTC \nfacilities.  Id. at 40970, tbl.22; see id. at 40949.  \n81.  These  massive  burdens  could  force  many  facilities  to  limit  their \ncapacity or close entirely, threatening to displace tens if not hundreds of thousands \nof nursing home residents.  See AHCA, Report: Increasing Nursing Home Staffing \n42 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 44 of 56   PageID 44\n \nMinimums  Estimated  at  $10  Billion  Annually  (July  19,  2022), \nhttps://archive.ph/wip/dTA9Q  (estimating  that  a  minimum  staffing  level  of  4.1 \nHPRD would threaten to displace as many as 205,000 nursing home residents); cf. \n89 Fed. Reg. at 40953 (recognizing risk of “closure of facilities due to inadequate \nstaff availability”).  Given these huge social and economic impacts, and the absence \nof “clear congressional authorization,” “there is every reason to ‘hesitate before \nconcluding that Congress meant to confer on [CMS] the authority it claims.”  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 725. \nCOUNT TWO \n(APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n82.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n83.  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires  that  agency \naction be “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  E.g., Texas v. United States, 40 \nF.4th 205, 226 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. \n414, 423 (2021)).  This standard “is not toothless”; to the contrary, “it has serious \nbite.”  Id.  The court “must set aside any action premised on reasoning that fails to \naccount for relevant factors or evinces a clear error of judgment.”  Id.  The court \nmust also set aside agency action when the agency “fail[ed] to respond to significant \npoints ... raised by the public comments.”  Huawei Techs. USA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th \n421, 449 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Carlson v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, \n43 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 45 of 56   PageID 45\n \n344 (D.C. Cir. 2019)).  And when, as here, an agency changes a longstanding policy, \nit must “show that there are good reasons for the new policy” and “be cognizant that \nlongstanding policies may have ‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be \ntaken into account.’”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 \n(2016) (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).  \nCMS’s adoption of the Final Rule violated these settled requirements several times \nover.  \nA.  One-Size-Fits-All Standards \n84.  Over the past 50 years, CMS and its predecessors have consistently \nrejected calls to deviate from the plain text of the Social Security Act by requiring \nnursing homes to provide “a specific ratio of nursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. \nat 2239.  In 1974, the Social Security Administration explained that “the variation \nfrom facility to facility in the composition of its nursing staff, physical layout, patient \nneeds[,] and the services necessary to meet those needs precludes setting such a \nfigure.”  Id.  In 1980, when HHS took over the administration of Medicare and \nMedicaid, it expressly declined to propose “any nursing staff ratios or minimum \nnumber of nursing hours per patient per day.”  45 Fed. Reg. at 47371.  In 1986, an \nHHS-commissioned study concluded that “prescribing simple staffing ratios clearly \nis inappropriate,” observing that individuals within a single facility have “widely \ndiffering needs,” and some facilities have a much “larger proportion of heavy-care \n44 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 46 of 56   PageID 46\n \nresidents” than other facilities.7  In 2002, the Secretary of HHS informed Congress \nthat  after  studying  the  issue  for  several  years,  it  was  not  recommending  the \nimposition of minimum-staffing ratios on LTC facilities.  Thompson Letter at 1.  And \nas recently as 2016, CMS again rejected requests to adopt minimum-staffing rules, \nreiterating that it is not reasonable to adopt “a ‘one size fits all’ approach” toward \nLTC  facilities  that  care  for  a  wide  range  of  resident  populations  with  greatly \ndivergent needs.  81 Fed. Reg. at 68755; see id. at 68754-56, 68758. \n85.  CMS  came  nowhere  near  providing  a  reasoned  explanation  for \ndeparting from its longstanding position that fixed numerical staffing requirements \nare inappropriate.  On the contrary, as AHCA explained in its comments on the \nproposed rule, the agency’s basic, oft-reiterated reason for rejecting prior calls to \nimpose blanket minimum-staffing ratios—that “LTC facilities are varied in their \nstructure and in their resident populations,” id. at 68758—remains equally true \ntoday.  See AHCA Cmt.6, 9-10, 13-14, 16; Abt Study at 2 (“Nursing homes with \nhigher-acuity or more clinically complex residents can require a higher level of \nstaffing to meet resident needs.”); id. at 11, 18 (similar).  Indeed, the recent Abt \nAssociates study concluded that the literature on nursing home staffing “has not \nidentified a minimum staffing level required for adequate care quality.”  Abt Study \nat 11.  That is hardly surprising.  To give just one example, LTC facilities that \n \n7 See Inst. of Med., supra, at 102-03.   \n45 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 47 of 56   PageID 47\n \nspecialize in serving especially vulnerable populations, such as individuals with \ndementia  or Alzheimer’s  disease,  naturally  require  more  staffing  than  facilities \nserving individuals with far lower levels of acuity.  See id. at 11-12; see also 81 Fed. \nReg. at 68755 (explaining that such ratios “could negatively impact the development \nof innovative care options”).  In short, the Final Rule will produce unreasonable \nover- and under-staffing because there is so much variation among nursing homes. \n86.  CMS’s  decision  to  impose  a  single,  nationwide  standard  is  also \nunreasonable in view of major differences among the States.  State Medicaid rates \nfor nursing home services vary from $170 per day to over $400 per day.  AHCA \nCmt.6.  Some States have a relatively good supply of RNs and NAs, while other \nStates—such as Texas—are facing a massive shortage.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40957, 40976; 81 Fed. Reg. at 6755 (noting “geographic disparity in supply” of \nnursing staff).  Far from “highlight[ing] the need for national minimum-staffing \nstandards,” as CMS now claims, the “widespread variability in existing minimum \nstaffing standards” adopted by 38 States and the District of Columbia underscores \nthat “different local circumstances ... make different staffing levels appropriate (and \nhigher levels impracticable) in different areas of the country.”  Compare 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40880, with AHCA Cmt.6.  By imposing fixed nationwide requirements that \n“exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States,” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40877, CMS has cast aside not only Congress’ clear command, but the \n46 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 48 of 56   PageID 48\n \nconsidered choices of state governments whose various state-law minimum staffing \nrequirements reflect their own particular local conditions. \n87.  CMS’s  attempts  to  justify  its  irrational  approach  are  woefully \ninsufficient.  CMS concedes that its 24/7 RN requirement imposes a “one-size-fits-\nall” requirement, 89 Fed. Reg. at 40908, but tries to avoid that characterization for \nits HPRD requirements on the ground that the HPRD ratio “is automatically adjusted \nfor size of facility.”  Id.  Of course, CMS itself previously described “minimum \nstaffing ratios” as “a ‘one size fits all’ approach,” 81 Fed. Reg. at 68755, and rightly \nso:  As the Final Rule makes clear, and as commenters underscored, the new HPRD \nrequirements—unlike the qualitative standard that Congress chose—do not account \nfor “the variation from facility to facility in the composition of its nursing staff, \nphysical layout, patient needs[,] and the services necessary to meet those needs.”  \nAHCA.Cmt.9 (quoting 39 Fed. Reg. at 2239); see, e.g., id. at 6, 13-14, 16, 19, 22; \naccord 81 Fed. Reg. at 68758-59 (denying requests to “utiliz[e] a minimum staffing \nstandard”  because  “LTC  facilities  are  varied  in  their  structure”  and  in  their \n“residents’ acuity and diagnoses”). \n88.  CMS asserts that the new standards do not need to “account[] for \nresident acuity” because they represent “minimum baseline standards for safety and \nquality.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40887; see id. at 40877, 40891-95.  But the 24/7 RN \nrequirement can hardly be plausibly described as a minimum-necessary “baseline” \n47 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 49 of 56   PageID 49\n \nwhen it triples the statutory requirement that has been in place for half a century.  So \ntoo for the new HPRD requirements, which CMS itself admits “exceed the existing \nminimum staffing requirements in nearly all States” that have any.  Id. at 40877; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 61359; AHCA Cmt.8.  And CMS acknowledges that “more than 79 \npercent of nursing facilities nationwide” cannot meet the new requirements with \ntheir current staff, but its own findings belie the notion that anywhere close to 79 \npercent of U.S. nursing homes are failing to meet “minimum baseline standards for \nsafety and quality.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40887.  On the contrary, CMS’s own survey \nprocess indicates that “roughly 95 percent of facilities” are already “providing \n‘sufficient nursing staff’” without the new requirements.  AHCA Cmt.25.  \n89.  CMS’s explanation for abandoning its decades-old rejection of one-\nsize-fits-all  staffing  requirements  boils  down  to  this:    Some  LTC  facilities  are \nchronically understaffed, and “evidence demonstrates the benefits of increased nurse \nstaffing in these facilities.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40881; see id. at 40893-94.  But the \ngeneral (and undisputed) proposition that increased staffing in understaffed facilities \ncan  lead  to  better  outcomes  does  not  justify  mandating  a  blanket  24/7  RN \nrequirement and three rigid HPRD requirements for all LTC facilities nationwide.  \nCMS has not offered any reasonable explanation for reversing its longstanding \nposition that high degree of “variation from facility to facility ... precludes setting” \nany generally applicable “ratio of nursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. at 2239; \n48 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 50 of 56   PageID 50\n \naccord 81 Fed. Reg. at 6875.  That is because there is no reasonable explanation for \nmandating 24/7 RN coverage and rigid HPRD ratios in all cases.  The agency’s \ndecision to impose one-size-fits-all staffing standards on LTC facilities was arbitrary \nand capricious and must be set aside.    \nB.  Unachievable Requirements \n90.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious for another reason as well:  \nAs  detailed  in AHCA  and THCA’s  comments  on  the  proposed  rule,  it  will  be \nimpossible for many LTC facilities to implement CMS’s new minimum-staffing \nrequirements because of the inadequate supply of RNs and NAs.  See AHCA Cmt.1-\n2, 5, 11-13, 18; THCA Cmt.1-2.  As CMS itself acknowledges, its new requirements \n“exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States” and will \nrequire increased staffing “in more than 79 percent of nursing facilities nationwide.”  \n89 Fed. Reg. at 40877.  CMS accordingly estimates that LTC facilities will need to \nhire an additional 15,906 additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN requirement and 0.55 \nRN HPRD requirement (a staffing increase of about 11.8%), plus an additional \n77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement and 3.48 total nurse HPRD \nrequirement (a staffing increase of about 17.2%).  See id. at 40958, 40977-80.  In \nTexas alone, facilities will need to hire about 2,579 additional RNs (an increase of \n46.1%) and 7,887 additional NAs (an increase of 28.4%).  Id. at 40,957, 40,976-80.  \nThose increases are beyond impossible at a time when many LTC facilities are \n49 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 51 of 56   PageID 51\n \nalready experiencing extreme difficulty finding qualified RNs and NAs to fill vacant \npositions, and when staffing shortages are expected only to worsen.  See, e.g., AHCA \nCmt.5.  Put simply, “staffing mandates do not create more caregivers, nor do they \ndrive caregivers to work in long term care.”  Id. at 1.  \n91.  The Final Rule also irrationally discounts the vital role of LPNs/LVNs, \nwho hold nearly 230,000 jobs in LTC facilities across the country and undisputedly \n“provide important services to [their] residents.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40881; see AHCA \nCmt.6.  As commenters pointed out, the Final Rule creates a perverse incentive for \nLTC facilities “to terminate LPN/LVNs and replace them with ... [less qualified] \nnurse aides” in order to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement.  CMS recognized this \nproblem in both the proposed rule and the Final Rule, but bizarrely concluded that \n“[a] total nurse staffing standard will guard[] against” it.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40893; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 61366, 61369.  That is obviously wrong.  For example, a facility that \nalready provides high-quality care through average staffing of 0.55 RN HPRD, 1.25 \nLVN/LPN HPRD, and 1.7 NA HPRD would satisfy the 3.48 total nurse HPRD \nrequirement but would need an additional 0.75 NA HPRD to satisfy the 2.45 NA \nHPRD  requirement.    The  Final  Rule  thus  pressures  LTC  facilities  to  replace \nexperienced LPNs/LVNs with less-qualified new hires in order to meet CMS’s \narbitrary quota of 2.45 NA HPRD. \n50 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 52 of 56   PageID 52\n \n92.  The staggering costs of the Final Rule underscore its arbitrary and \ncapricious nature.  By CMS’s own estimate, the Final Rule will cost over $5 billion \nper year to implement once fully phased in, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 40949, 40970; other \nestimates place the costs as high as $7 billion per year, see id. at 40950.  The Final \nRule does not provide any additional funding for Medicare or Medicaid, so CMS \n“assume[s] that LTC facilities ... will bear the[se] costs.”  Id. at 40949.  As AHCA \nand THCA explained in their comments, LTC facilities are in no position to take on \nthis huge financial burden.  AHCA Cmt.5; THCA Cmt.3.  Nearly 60 percent of LTC \nfacilities already have negative operating margins; more than 500 LTC facilities \nclosed over the course of the pandemic; and the costs associated with these new \nstaffing mandates would likely force many more facilities to close.  AHCA Cmt.5.   \n93.  CMS’s decision to impose this massive, unfunded staffing mandate, \ndespite the ongoing workforce crisis and economic realities, is neither “reasonable” \nnor “reasonably explained.”  Cf. Texas, 40 F.4th at 226.  The Final Rule nowhere \ndenies that there presently are not nearly enough RNs and NAs available to enable \nthe 79 percent of LTC facilities that are not presently in compliance to satisfy the \nagency’s new mandates.  It instead just touts a new initiative that seeks to encourage \npeople to pursue careers in nursing by “investing over $75 million in financial \nincentives such as tuition reimbursement.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40894.  But, as AHCA has \nexplained, this “one-time workforce effort is not going to fix the workforce crisis,” \n51 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 53 of 56   PageID 53\n \nand it does practically nothing to offset the $5 billion to $7 billion per year in costs \nthat the Final Rule imposes on LTC facilities.   \n94.  CMS  asserts  that  the  Final  Rule’s  phase-in  period  will  “allow  all \nfacilities  the  time  needed  to  prepare  and  comply  with  the  new  requirements \nspecifically to recruit, retain, and hire nurse staff as needed.”  Id.  But delaying the \ndeadline for compliance does nothing to fix the underlying problems identified by \nAHCA and THCA.  Regardless of whether it goes into effect tomorrow or two or \nthree years from now, the Final Rule is still a multi-billion-dollar unfunded mandate \nthat many LTC facilities will have no realistic way to meet.  And there is no reason \nto think that the shortage of RNs and NAs will ease over the next two to three years; \nto the contrary, it is projected to become even worse, as “hundreds of thousands are \nexpected to retire or leave the health care profession entirely in the coming years.”  \nAHCA  Cmt.5;  see  id.  at  2  (“The  phase-in  provisions  are  frankly  meaningless \nconsidering the growing caregiver shortage.”).  CMS says that it “fully expect[s] that \nLTC facilities will be able to meet [the Final Rule’s] requirements,” 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40894, but it fails to cite any evidence to support this wishful thinking.  \n95.  Finally, CMS’s “hardship exemption” process is a wholly inadequate \nresponse to the staffing shortage and economic constraints facing LTC facilities.  For \none thing, such exemptions are available only to facilities that have been surveyed \nand cited for failure to meet the new staffing standards—and “facilities cannot \n52 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 1   Filed 05/23/24    Page 54 of 56   PageID 54\n \nrequest”  (or  receive)  “a  survey  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  granting  an \nexemption.”  Id. at 40902.  Thus, instead of being able to proactively explain why it \nshould be entitled to an exemption, facilities that cannot meet CMS’s arbitrary \nrequirements will face a perpetual risk of being sanctioned for non-compliance.  See \nAHCA Cmt.6, 33-34.  In all events, the waivers are “no solution for the ongoing \nnationwide shortage in nursing staff” or the lack of funds available to implement the \nnew requirements.  Id. at 7.  Indeed, CMS repeatedly emphasizes that the hardship \nexemption is meant for “limited circumstances,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40894, and that \nmany facilities in areas of the country with severe shortages of available RNs and \nNAs  would  not  qualify  for  an  exemption  because  there  are  so  many  “other \nrequirements” that must be met “to obtain an exemption.”  Id. at 40953.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs pray for the following relief from the Court: \n1.

See,  e.g.,  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Programs;  Minimum  Staffing \nStandards  for Long-Term  Care  Facilities  and  Medicaid  Institutional  Payment  Transparency \nReporting,  89  Fed.  Reg.  40876,  40833  (May  10,  2024)  (recounting personal  stories  of nursing \nhome  failures).  These  failures  include  “inadequate  staffing  levels,  poor  infection  control, \nfailures  in oversight  and  regulation,  and  deficiencies  that result  in actual  patient harm”  and \na  “pervasive  .  .  .  undervaluing  [of]  the  lives  of older  adults.”  NAT'L ACADS.  OF  SCIS.,  ENG’G &\n  \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 2 of 25     PageID 880\nMED.,  THE  NATIONAL  IMPERATIVE  TO  IMPROVE  NURSING  HOME  QUALITY:  HONORING  OUR \nCOMMITMENT TO RESIDENTS,  FAMILIES, AND  STAFF 2  (2022). \nThese  deficiencies  deserve  an  effectual  response.  But  any  regulatory  response  must \nbe  consistent  with  Congress’s  legislation  governing  nursing  homes.  The  Final  Rule’s \nchallenged  provisions  are  not.  Though  the  Final  Rule  attempts  to  remedy  chronic  nursing \nhome  deficiencies,  it  does  so  deficiently.  It  requires  nursing homes  participating in  Medicare \nor  Medicaid  to  have  a  registered  nurse  on  staff at  least  twenty-four  hours  a  day,  although \nCongress  set  the  baseline  at  eight  hours  a  day.  And  it  attempts  to  require  every  participant \nnursing  home  to  achieve  minimum  staffing  hours  only  based  on  a  facility’s  number  of \nresidents,  although Congress mandated consideration of a facility's individual nursing needs. \nThough  rooted  in  laudable  goals,  the  Final  Rule  still  must  be  consistent  with  Congress’s \nstatutes.  To  allow otherwise  permits  agencies  to  amend  statutes  though  they lack legislative \npower.  Separation  of powers  demands  more  than  praiseworthy  intent. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Medicare  and Medicaid  Programs \nCongress  amended  the  Social  Security  Act  in  1965  to  create  Medicare  and  Medicaid. \nSee  Social  Security Amendments  of 1965,  Pub.  L.  No.  89-97,  79  Stat.  286.  Medicare  provides \nhealth  insurance  to  those  sixty-five  years  and  older.  42  U.S.C.  §1395c.  The  federal \ngovernment  runs  Medicare.  Medicaid  provides  health  insurance  to  low-income  people.  42 \nU.S.C.  §§  1396-1,  1396a. \nMedicaid  is  a joint  federal-state  program.  Miller  v.  Gorski  Wladyslaw  Est.,  547  F.3d \n273,  277  (5th  Cir.  2008)  (“Under  this  system  of ‘cooperative  federalism,’  if a  state  agrees  to \nestablish  a  Medicaid plan,  the federal  government  agrees to pay a  specified percentage  of the \ntotal  amount  the  state  plan  spends  on  medical  assistance.”  (quoting  Harris  v.  McRae,  448 \n \nU.S.  297,  308  (1980))). \n  \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 3 of 25     PageID 881\nPrivate  providers,  government  healthcare  facilities,  or  individual  healthcare \nprofessionals offer healthcare services under these programs.  Participation in either program \nis  voluntary.  Miller,  547  F.3d  at  277;  True  Health  Diagnostics,  LLC  v.  Azar,  392  F.  Supp.  3d \n656,  660  (E.D.  Tex.  2019).  If healthcare  providers  or  states  choose  to  participate,  they  agree \nto  comply  with  federal  statutes  and  regulations  governing  them.  See  42  U.S.C.  §§  1395cc, \n1896a.  The  Secretary  of Health  and  Human  Services  administers  the  programs  through  the \nCenter  for  Medicare  and  Medicaid  Services  (“CMS”).  Ark.  Dep’t  of Health  &  Hum.  Servs.  v. \nAhlborn,  547  U.S.  268,  275  (2006).  Congress  empowered  the  Secretary  to  issue  rules  and \nregulations  “as  may  be  necessary  to  the  efficient  administration  of  the  functions”  he  has \nunder  the  Social  Security  Act.  42  U.S.C.  §§  1302(a),  13895hh  (“The  Secretary  shall  prescribe \nsuch  regulations  as  may be  necessary to  carry  out  the  administration  of [Medicare].”). \nNursing homes  often  participate  in  both  programs.  Under  Medicare,  they  must  meet \nstatutory  and  regulatory  requirements  for  “skilled  nursing  facilities.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i-3. \nUnder  Medicaid,  they  must  meet  statutory  and  regulatory  requirements  for  “nursing \nfacilities.”  42  U.S.C.  §  13896r.  Nursing  homes  participating  in  either  or  both  programs  are \n“long-term  care”  facilities  that must  meet  a  consolidated  set of regulations.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.1 \n(2024).  97.8%  of nursing  homes  participate  in  Medicare  and  95.4%  participate  in  Medicaid. \nSee  ECF  No.  57-1  at  11-12  &  n.2. \nII.  Historic  Nursing Home  Regulations \nCongress,  along  with  various  agencies,  has  regulated  participating  nursing  homes. \nCongress  at  first  required  all  nursing  homes  under  either  program  to  “providel]  24-hour \nnursing  service  which  is  sufficient  to  meet  nursing  needs  in  accordance  with  the  [facility’s \npolicies],  and  has  at  least  one  registered  professional  nurse  employed  full  time.”  42  U.S.C. \n§§  1895x(j)(6),  1896a(a)(28)  (1976).  Congress  did  not further mandate  how to  accomplish this \nrequirement. \n  \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 4 of 25     PageID 882\nThe  Social  Security  Administration  proposed  regulations  to  carry  out  Congress’s \nrequirements.  Federal  Health  Insurance  for  the  Aged:  Skilled  Nursing  Facilities,  38  Fed. \nReg.  18620 (July  12,  1973). These proposed regulations used the same language as the statute \nand  required  the  full-time  nurse  work  “during  the  day  tour  of  duty  5  days  a  week.”  Id.  at \n18625.  The  Social  Security  Administration  rejected  a  proposal  to  impose  “a  specific  ratio  of \nnursing staff to  patients.”  Skilled  Nursing Facilities,  39  Fed.  Reg.  2238,  2239  (Jan.  17,  1974). \nThat  is  “because  the  variation  from  facility  to  facility  in  the  composition  of its  nursing  staff, \nphysical  layout,  patient  needs  and  the  services  necessary  to  meet  those  needs  preclude[d] \nsetting  such a  figure.” Id. \nThe  Department  of  Health  and  Human  Services  (“HHS”)  proposed  revising  the \nregulations  once  it  took  over  administering  Medicare  and  Medicaid  in  1980.  See  Conditions \nof  Participation  for  Skilled  Nursing  and  Intermediate  Care  Facilities,  45  Fed.  Reg.  47368 \n(July  14,  1980).  But  again,  the  agency  declined  to  “propose[]  any  nursing  staff  ratios  or \nminimum  number  of nursing hours  per  patient  per  day.” Id.  at  47371.  This  time,  the  agency \nadmitted  “[o]ne  of the  reasons”  it  declined  was  because  it  “was  not  sure  how  much  staffing \nwill  be  required”  and  did  “not  have  enough  conclusive  evidence  to  support  requiring  any \nspecific numerical  standards.” Id. \nSo HHS commissioned a multi-year  study,  in part,  to examine the issue.  See  Medicare \nand  Medicaid;  Conditions  of Participation  for Long Term  Care Facilities,  52  Fed.  Reg.  38582, \n88583  (Oct.  16,  1987)  (discussing  the  Institute  of  Medicine  study  to  evaluate  “Federal \nregulations  concerning  long  term  care  facilities”  and  examine  how  states  regulate  the \nfacilities).  The Institute  of Medicine study concluded that “because  of the  complexities  of case \nmix...  [and]  the  wildly  differing  needs  of  individual  residents  in  the  same  facility,” \n“prescribing  simple  staffing  ratios  clearly  is  inappropriate.”  INST.  OF  MED.,  IMPROVING THE \n QUALITY  OF  CARE  IN  NURSING  HOMES  102  (1 986).  The  study  recommended  further  data \n \n\n  \nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 5 of 25     PageID 883\ncollection  “to  develop  an  algorithm  for  relating minimum  nursing  staff requirements  to  case \nmix”—not  to  implement a  flat hours-to-resident staffing ratio. Jd.  at  200  (expressing interest \nin  “an  empirically  derived  algorithm  used  to  estimate  the  daily  nursing  time  requirements \nfor  a  resident  based  on  his/her  assessment  scores  and  service  needs”).  In  short,  the  Institute \nfor  Medicine  evaluated  current  regulations  and  recommended  that  while  a  fine-tuned, \nfacility-specific algorithm for minimum staffing requirements could be  appropriate with more \ndata,  “simple  staffing  ratios”  like  “nurse-to-resident  ratios”  were  “inappropriate”  because \nthey  do  not  account  for “wildly  differing needs.” Id.  at  101,  102. \nThe  study,  and  myriad  other  concerns,  prompted  Congress  to  enact  substantial \nrevisions  to  the  statutes  governing  nursing  home  participation  in  Medicare  and  Medicaid. \n  \nOmnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1987,  Pub.  L.  No.  100-203,  §§  4201-4218,  101  Stat. \n1330,  1330-160  to  1330-221;  H.R.  REP.  No.  100-391,  pt.  1,  at  452  (1987)  (explaining  that  the \nInstitute  of  Medicine’s  finding  that  many  nursing  homes  provide  “shockingly  deficient” \nsparked  changes  “to  improve  the  quality  of  care  for  Medicaid-eligible  nursing  home \nresidents”). \nCongress’s  changes  were  extensive  and  particularized.  It  consolidated  a  former  two- \ntier  division  between  skilled  nursing  facilities  and  intermediate  care  facilities  with  only  a \n“nursing facilities”  (“NFs”)  designation  for  Medicaid  and  “skilled  nursing facilities”  (“SNFs”) \nin  Medicare.  Id.  §  4211(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330-183  to  1330-203.  It  then  required  both  NFs  and \nSNFs  to  “provide  24-hour  nursing service which  is  sufficient  to  meet nursing needs  of [their] \nresidents”  and  to  “employ  the  services  of a  registered  professional  nurse  at  least  during  the \nday  tour  of duty  (of at  least  8  hours  a  day)  7  days  a  week.”  Id.  §  4201(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330- \n163;  see  also  id.  §  4211(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330-186  (requiring  Medicaid  NF's  “provide  24-hour \nlicensed  nursing services  which  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing  needs  of [their]  residents, \nand...  use  the  services  of a  registered  nurse  for  at  least  8  consecutive  hours  a  day,  7  days  a\n\n  \nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 6 of 25     PageID 884\nweek”).  A  committee  rejected  a  proposal  to  require  a  registered  nurse  on-site  twenty-four \nhours  a day,  seven days  a week.  133  Cong.  Rec.  28998  (1987). And  Congress  let die a separate \nbill requiring the  same.  H.R.  3543,  100th Cong.  (1987).  NF's  and SNFs could only escape these \nrequirements  through a  detailed  process that  allowed  the  Secretary to waive them.  Omnibus \nBudget  Reconciliation Act  of 1987,  Pub.  L.  No.  100-203,  §  4201(a),  101  Stat.  1330,  1330-163; \nid.  §  4211(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330-186. \nCongress  also  granted  the  Secretary  regulatory  authority  to  “assure  that \nrequirements”  for  NFs  and  SNFs  “are  adequate  to  protect  the  health,  safety,  welfare,  and \nrights  of  residents  and  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  public  moneys.”  Id. \n§  4201(a)(3),  101  Stat.  at  1330-172,  §  4211(c),  101  Stat.  at  1330-200.  Additionally,  Congress \ngranted  the  Secretary  regulatory  authority  over  NFs  and  SNFs  to  craft  “requirements \nrelating to the  health,  safety,  and well-being of residents  or relating to  the  physical  facilities \nthereof  as  [he]  may  find  necessary.”  Id.  §  4201(a)(3),  101  Stat.  at  1330-171;  §  4211(b),  101 \nStat.  at  1330-196. \nCongress  later ordered  the  Secretary to  conduct  a  study examining whether  Congress \nshould impose  “minimum caregiver to  resident ratios  .  .  .  for skilled nursing facilities  .  .  .  and \nnursing  facilities.”  Omnibus  Budget  Reconciliation  Act  of  1990,  Pub.  L.  No.  101-508, \n§  4801(e)(17)(B),  104  Stat.  1888-218  to  1888-219.  Congress  ordered the  Secretary to complete \nthe  study  before  January  1,  1992,  and  to  provide  “recommendations  regarding  appropriate \nminimum  ratios.”  Id.  §  4801(e)(17)(B),  104  Stat.  at  1388-219.  The  Secretary  missed  the \ndeadline  by  ten  years  but  finally  pronounced  that  “insufficient”  data  existed,  and  questions \nremained about “the feasibility of establishing staff ratios.” Letter from Tommy G.  Thompson, \nSec’y of Health &  Hum.  Servs., to  J.  Dennis Hastert,  Speaker of the House of Representatives \n1  (Mar.  19,  2002),  reprinted  in  OFF.

Thus,  the \nSecretary  opined  that  Congress  should  not  “establish[]  minimum  ratios” yet.  Id.  at  2. \nIII.  The  Statute  and  Regulations \nTogether,  Congress’s  past  enactments  require  each  Medicare  or  Medicaid  nursing \nhome  to  “provide  24-hour  licensed  nursing  services  which  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing \nneeds  of its  residents”  and  to  “use  the  services  of a  registered  professional  nurse  for  at  least \n8  consecutive  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week.”  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396r(b)(4)(C)@(MHID, \n1895i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  For Medicare,  the  Secretary may waive  the  8-hours-a-day,  7-days-a-week \nrequirement.  Jd.  §  1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(ii).  For  Medicaid,  a  particular  state  may  waive  either  or \nboth  requirements  and  the  Secretary  may  also  exercise  the  waiver  power.  Id. \n§  1396r(b)(4)(C)(ii),  (iii). \nHHS  promulgated  regulations  that  duplicated  Congress’s  mandate  in  relevant  parts. \nHHS  required nursing homes  to have  “sufficient nursing staff to  provide  nursing and  related \nservices to  attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental,  and psychosocial well- \nbeing  of  each  resident.”  42  C.F.R.  §  483.30  (2016).  This  meant  each  “facility  must  provide \nservices  by  sufficient  numbers  [of  different  types  of  nurses]  on  a  24-hour  basis  to  provide \nnursing  care  to  all  residents.”  Id.  §  483.30(a).  For  registered  nurses  specifically,  HHS \nrequired  each  facility  “use  the  services  of a  registered  nurse  for  at  least  8  consecutive  hours \na  day,  7  days  a  week.”  Id.  §  483.30(b).  In  2016,  CMS  declined  to  depart  from  its  statute- \nmirroring  regulations  and  impose  mandatory  staffing ratios  and  a  24-hour  registered  nurse \nrequirement.  Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Reform of Requirements for Long-Term Care \nFacilities,  81  Fed.  Reg.  68688,  68754—56  (Oct.  4,  2016).  It  refused  because  (1)  it  could  not \nidentify  the  proper  ratio,  (2)  nursing  homes  were  too  varied  to  have  a  blanket  number,  (3) \nnursing homes might be unable to find sufficient staff,  and (4) nursing homes might only staff \nto  the  minimum.  Jd.  at  68755-56.  Before  the  Final  Rule  at  issue  here,  congressional \nre\n  \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 8 of 25     PageID 886\nmandates  governed  licensed  nursing  services  and  registered  nurse  hour  requirements,  as \nimplemented  by the  regulations. \nIV.  The  Rule \nIn  February  2022,  the  Biden  Administration  announced  its  intent  to  establish  a \nminimum  nursing  home  staffing  requirement  to  “ensure[]  that  all  nursing  home  residents \nare  provided  safe,  quality  care.”  Fact  Sheet:  Protecting  Seniors  by  Improving  Safety  and \nQuality  of Care  in  the  Nation’s  Nursing  Homes,  THE  WHITE  HOUSE  (Feb.  28,  2022),  https:// \nbidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet- \nprotecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in- \nthe-nations-nursing-homes/  [https://perma.cc/EYP8-8M7W].  It  ordered  a  research  study  to \n“determine  the  level  and  type  of staffing needed  to  ensure  safe  and  quality  care.” Id. \nCMS  published  the  research  study  in  June  2023.  Admin.  Rec.  at  69982.  The  study \nconcluded  that  higher  staffing  is  related  to  better  quality  care  but  that  there  was  no  “clear \nevidence  basis  for  setting  a  minimum  staffing  level.”  Id.  at  69993.  Further,  the  study \nidentified  other  factors  beyond  staffing  levels,  such  as  “[r]esident  care  needs,  which  vary \ndepending on  acuity,  clinical  complexity,  and  other resident  characteristics,  [that]  could  also \ndirectly  influence  quality  of care.”  Id.  at  70006.  And  it  recognized  that  “workforce  shortages \nand  current hiring challenges  could present barriers  to  nursing home  compliance with  a new \nfederal  staffing requirement.” Jd.  at  70003.  Thus,  nursing home “staffing levels  are a  ‘critical \nfactor’ in determining nursing home quality of care,” but “no obvious  plateau at which quality \nand  safety  are  maximized  [nor  ‘cliff  below  which  quality  and  safety  steeply  decline”  exists. \nId.  at  69990,  69993  (internal  quotation  omitted). \nCMS  proposed  a  rule  mandating  a  staffing plateau  three  months  later.  Medicare  and \nMedicaid  Programs;  Minimum  Staffing  Standards  for  Long-Term  Care  Facilities  and \nMedicaid Institutional  Payment Transparency Reporting,  88  Fed.  Reg.  61352  (Sept.  6,  2023). \n \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 9 of 25     PageID 887\nThe  proposed  rule  first  independently  proposed  to  “require  an  RN  to  be  on  site  24  hours  per \nday  and  7  days  per  week  to  provide  skilled  nursing  care  to  all  residents” Id.  at  61353;  ECF \nNo.  80-1  at  18.  Second,  it  “propose[d]  individual  minimum  nurse  staffing  standards  of 0.55 \nhours  per  resident  day  (HPRD)  for  RNs  and  2.45  HPRD  for  NAs.”  88  Fed.  Reg.  at  61357.  It \nclarified  that  “meeting  the  24/7  requirement  does  not  also  count  as  meeting  the  0.55  RN \nHPRD  and  2.45  NA  HPRD  [requirements]  and  vice  versa.”  Id.  at  61376.  The  proposed  rule \nelicited  46,520  comments.

Reg.  40876,  40883  (May  10,  2024). \nCMS  promulgated  the  Final Rule  in May 2024. Id.  at  40876.  The Final Rule contained \nsome  modifications  from  the  proposed  rule  “to  provide  additional  flexibility  and  time  for \nfacilities  to  implement  the[]  changes.”  Jd.  at  40886.  First,  the  Final  Rule  “staggered \nimplementation  dates  over  a  period  of up  to  five  years.”  Id.  Second,  it  added  a  “total  nurse \nstaffing  standard”  and  added  “exemptions  from  the  minimum  staffing  standards.”  Id.  The \ntotal  nurse  staffing  standard  required  “at  a  minimum,  3.48  total  nurse  staffing  hours  per \nresident  day  (HPRD).”  Id.  at  40877.  Underscoring  that  these  minimum  staffing  standards \ndisregard a  facility's  individual  resident  needs  and  cases,  CMS  declared  that  “facilities  must \nmeet  the  minimum  3.48  total  nurse  staffing,  0.55  RN,  and  2.45  NA  HPRD  standards \nregardless  of the  individual  facility’s  resident  case-mix,  as  they  are  the  minimum  standard \nof staffing.” Id. \nThus,  the  Final  Rule  put  in  place  the  two  provisions  challenged  here.  The  first \nprovision  mandates  that  a  “facility  must  have  a  registered  nurse  (RN)  onsite  24  hours  per \nday,  for  7  days  a week that  is  available  to  provide  direct  resident  care” (“24/7  Requirement”). \n \n  \n  \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 10 of 25     PageID 888\n42  C.F.R.  §  483.35(c)(1)  (2024).  The  second  provision  requires  facilities  to  comply with  three \nseparate minimum staffing standards  (“HPRD  Requirements”).  First, the “facility must meet \nor  exceed  a  minimum  of  3.48  hours  per  resident  day  for  total  nurse  staffing.”  Id. \n§  483.35(b)(1).

FED.  R.  CIv.  P.  56(a). \nThe moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating both.  See  Celotex Corp.  v.  Catrett, \n477  U.S.  317,  322  (1986).  A  genuine  dispute  of material  fact  exists  if “the  evidence  is  such \nthat  a  reasonable jury  could  return  a  verdict  for  the  non-moving  party.” Anderson  v.  Liberty \nLobby,  Inc.,  477  U.S.  242,  248  (1986). \nSummary judgment  “is  particularly  appropriate  in  cases  in  which  the  court  is  asked \nto  review  or enforce  a  decision  of a  federal  administrative  agency.”  Girling Health  Care,  Inc. \nv.  Shalala,  85  F.3d  211,  214-15  (5th  Cir.  1996).  “Under  the APA,  it  is  the  role  of the  agency \nto  resolve  factual  issues  to  arrive  at  a  decision  that  is  supported  by  the  administrative \nrecord.” Hi-Tech  Pharmacal  Co.,  Inc.  v.  FDA,  587  F.  Supp.  2d  13,  18  (D.D.C.  2008).  And  the \ncourt’s  role  in  an  APA  case  is  to  “sit[]  as  an  appellate  tribunal.”  Am.  Bioscience,  Inc.  v. \nThompson,  269  F.3d  1077,  1083  (D.C.  Cir.  2001);  see  also  Amin  v.  Mayorkas,  24  F.4th  383, \n391  (5th  Cir.  2022).  In  such  a  posture,  the  “entire  case  on  review  is  a  question  of law,  and \nonly  a  question  of law.”  Marshall  Cnty.  Health  Care  Auth.  v.  Shalala,  988  F.2d  1221,  1226 \n(D.C.  Cir.  1993).  So  summary judgment in  an APA case  “merely serves  as  the  mechanism  for \ndeciding,  as  a  matter  of law,  whether  the  agency  action  is  supported  by  the  administrative \nrecord  and  otherwise consistent with the APA standard  of review.”  Oceana,  Inc.  v.  Locke,  831 \nF.  Supp.  2d  95,  106  (D.D.C.  2011).  Judicial  review  under  the  APA  is  limited  to  the \nadministrative  record.  5  U.S.C.  §  706. \nANALYSIS \nThe  APA  demands  courts  “hold  unlawful  and  set  aside”  agency  action  “not  in \naccordance with law” and “in excess of statutory jurisdiction.” 5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(A),  (C).

After  Loper  Bright,  the  “text  of the  APA  means  what  it  says.”  144  S. \nCt.  at  2262.  Courts  interpret  the  meaning  of  statutes  and  evaluate  whether  agencies  are \nwithin  their  bounds.  Agencies  possess  “only  the  authority  that  Congress  has  provided” \nbecause  they  are  “creatures  of statute.”  Natl  Fed’n  of Indep.  Bus.  v.  Dep’t  of Lab.,  595  U.S. \n109,  117  (2022). \nI.  The  24/7  Requirement  Exceeds  CMS’s  Statutory Authority \nPlaintiffs  argue  the  24/7  Requirement  impermissibly  replaces  Congress’s  mandate \nthat  nursing  homes  “use  the  services  of  a  registered  professional  nurse  for  at  least  8 \nconsecutive  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week.”  ECF  No.  57-1  at  33-34;  42  U.S.C. \n§§  1896r(b)(4)(C)(i),  1895i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  They  claim  it  “alters  this  statutory  requirement  in \ntwo  distinct  ways.”  ECF  No.  57-1  at  33-34.  First,  it  replaces  eight  with  twenty-four.  Second, \nit  changes  the  statute’s  language  of “use  the  services”  of an  RN  to  instead  require  an  RN  be \n“available  to  provide  direct  resident  care.” Id.  at  34  (quoting 89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40997). \nDefendants  respond  that  other  provisions  grant  the  power  to  impose  the  24/7 \nRequirement—not the provision requiring at least eight hours  a day,  seven days  a week.  ECF \nNo.  80-1  at  23  (invoking  42  U.S.C.  Sections  1396r(d)(4)(B)  among  others);  see  also  89  Fed. \nReg.  at  40891  (relying  on  “separate  authority”  to  impose  the  24/7  Requirement  and  not  the \nstatute’s  8  hours/7  days  provision).  They  reference  several  provisions  they  claim  grant \nauthority  to  issue  the  requirements.  First,  in  42  U.S.C.  Section  1396r(d)(4)(B),  Congress \nempowered  the  Secretary  to  implement  “such  other  requirements  relating  to  the  health  and \nsafety  of residents  or  relating  to  the  physical  facilities  thereof as  [he]  may  find  necessary.” \nSecond,  in 42  U.S.C.  Section  1396r(f)(1),  Congress declared “[i]t is the  duty and responsibility \nof the  Secretary  to  assure  that  requirements  .  .  .  are  adequate  to  protect  the  health,  safety, \n12\n\n  \nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 13 of 25     PageID 891\nwelfare,  and  rights  of  residents  and  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  public \nmoneys.” Medicare’s  provisions  are  similar.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i-3(d)(4)(B),  (f)(1). \nDefendants claim these provisions “are broadly worded to give HHS  significant leeway \nin  deciding  how  best  to  safeguard...  residents’  health  and  safety.”  ECF  No.  80-1  at  21 \n(quoting  Northport  Health  Servs.  of Ark.,  LLC v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of Health  & Hum.  Servs.,  14 F.4th \n856,  870  (8th  Cir.  2021)).  The  24/7  Requirement  is  valid  under these  provisions,  they  argue, \nand  does  not conflict with  Congress’s  8  hours/7  days requirement because  Congress  used the \nwords  “at  least  8  consecutive  hours  a  day,  7  days  a  week.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4)(C)() \n(emphasis  added);  ECF  No.  80-1  at  24.  Defendants  claim  Plaintiffs  must  “read  the words  ‘at \nleast’  out  of the  statute  entirely”  to  prevail.  ECF  No.  80-1  at  24.  Because  “at  least”  is  there, \nthey claim they have “discretionary authority” to “fill up the  details of [the]  statutory scheme” \nand  impose  higher  requirements  if they  choose.  Loper  Bright,  144  8.  Ct.  at  2263  (internal \nquotation  omitted);  ECF  No.  80-1  at  23. \nA.  The  24/7  Requirement Amends  Congress’s  Baseline \nCMS  lacks  authority  to  issue  a  regulation  that  replaces  Congress’s  preferred \nminimum hours with its  own.  That is  exactly what the  24/7  Requirement does.  Congress took \nit  upon  itself to  set the  minimum  hours  nursing homes  “must  use  the  services  of a registered \nprofessional nurse.” 42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4)(C)@(D.  It set that level at “at least 8 consecutive \nhours  a  day.”  Id.  The  24/7  Requirement  in  effect  amends  the  statute  because  it  strikes \nCongress’s  “8,”  and  replaces  it with  the  agency’s  “24.”  42  C.F.R.  §  483.35(c)(1)  (“[T]he  facility \nmust have  a registered nurse (RN)  onsite 24 hours  per day,  for 7 days  a week  .  ..  .” (emphasis \nadded)).  But  agencies  lack  the  power  to  amend  statutes,  regardless  of other  provisions  that \nmay  grant  authority  to  regulate  the  space.  Agencies  may  add  detail  to  and  enforce  statutes. \nSee  Loper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at  2263.  That  does  not  extend  to  replacing  Congress’s  number \nwith  a  different  one.  “That  would  let  the  agency  amend  [a]  scheme  delineated  by  statute.” \n13\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 14 of 25     PageID 892\nNat'l  Horsemen’s  Benevolent  &  Protective Ass’n  v.  Black,  107  F.4th  415,  432  (5th  Cir.  2024). \nAgencies  lack  statutory  amendment  power. \nDefendants’  arguments to  the  contrary  are  unavailing.  They  argue  various provisions \nof Medicare  and Medicaid  “expressly  delegate” “discretionary authority” to “fill up the  details \nof  a  statutory  scheme.”  ECF  No.  80-1  at  23  (quoting  Loper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at  2263). \nCongress  routinely  enacts  statutes  that  grant  agencies  the  authority  “to  prescribe  rules  to \n‘fill  up the  details’  of a  statutory  scheme” or to “give  meaning to  a  particular  statutory term.” \nLoper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at  2263  (quoting  Wayman  v.  Southard,  23  U.S.  (10  Wheat.)  1,  23 \n(1825)).  Defendants  point  to  several  Medicare  and  Medicaid  provisions  that  do  just  that. \nCongress  requires  nursing  homes  to  “provide  (or  arrange  for  the  provision  of)...  dietary \nservices  that  assure  that  the  meals  meet  the  daily  nutritional  and  special  dietary  needs  of \neach  resident.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4).  The  agency’s  regulations  “fill  up  the  details”  and \nexplain  how  nursing homes  must fulfill  that  statutory  requirement.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.60(a)(1) \n(2024).  In  the  same  way,  Congress  required  nursing  homes  to  “establish  and  maintain  an \ninfection control  program.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(d)(3)(A).  Again,  the  agency’s  regulations “fill up \nthe  details”  and  explain  nursing  homes  comply  with  that  requirement  when  they  employ  a \nspecially  trained  “[iJnfection  preventionist”  to  oversee  that  program.  42  C.F.R.  §  483.80(b) \n(2024). \nNone  of these  examples  exhibit  the  agency  replacing  a  statutory  command  with  one \nof its  own.  Instead,  they  are  within  the  normal  realm  of agencies  adding  details  and  specific \nrequirements  to  Congress’s  less  specific  mandates.  In  its  example  regulations,  the  agency \nexplains  what  compliance  with  the  statute  is:  employing  a  qualified  dietitian  or  a  trained \ninfection  preventionist.  Defendants’  examples  are  inapposite  because  they  do  not \ndemonstrate  the  agency  replacing  Congress’s  specific  terms  with  different  ones.  The \nprovisions  Defendants  cite  provide  them  the  authority  to  issue  these  regulations.  See  Biden \n14 \nne\n\n  \nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 15 of 25     PageID 893\nv.  Missouri,  595  U.S.  87,  94  (2022)  (“[T]he  Secretary  routinely  imposes  conditions  of \nparticipation that relate to the qualifications  and duties of healthcare workers themselves  .  .  . \n[and]  has  always  justified  these  sorts  of  requirements  by  citing  his  authorities  to  protect \n   patient health  and  safety.”). \nHere,  the  Court  need  not  decide  whether  the  provisions  Defendants  cite  would  grant \nthe  authority  the  agency  claims  to  issue  the  24/7  Requirement.  It  is  true  “Congress  has \nauthorized the  Secretary to  impose  conditions  on the  receipt of Medicaid  and  Medicare  funds \nthat  ‘the  Secretary finds  necessary in the  interest of the  health  and  safety  of individuals  who \nare  furnished  services.”  Missouri,  595  U.S.  at  93  (quoting  42  U.S.C.  §  1395x(e)(9)).  But,  the \nagency’s  exercise  of that  authority  in  the  24/7  Requirement  plainly  changes  the  minimum \nhours  requirement  Congress  set  as  a  statutory  baseline.  Congress  did  not  grant  statutory \namendment  authority nor  stay  silent  on the  base  number of hours  a  nursing home  must  use \nan  RN’s  services.  It  answered  eight.  Congress  reserved  to  itself  that  decision.  And  it  has \nalways  done  so.  Moreover,  it has rejected  attempts  to  change the  number.  See  133  Cong.  Reg. \n28998  (1987);  H.R.  3543,  100th  Cong.  (1987); see also  West Virginia  v.  Env’t Prot.  Agency,  597 \nU.S.  697,  743  (2022)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring)  (explaining  rejected  congressional  proposals \n“may  be  a  sign  that  an  agency  is  attempting  to  ‘work  [a]round’  the  legislative  process” \n(alteration  in  original)  (quoting Nat?  Fed’n  of Indep.  Bus.  v.  Occupational  Safety  &  Health \nAdmin.,  142  S.  Ct.  661,  668 (2022) (Gorsuch, J.,  concurring))).  In Defendants’ other examples, \nCongress  did  not  specify  what  “dietary  services”  would  meet  its  mandate  nor  did  it  explain \nwhat  metrics  an  “infection  control  program”  must  satisfy.  See  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4), \n(d)(3)(A).  So  the  agency  exercised  proper  authority to  explain them. \nAgencies  may  exercise  general  authority  to  explain  details  of a  statutory  scheme  but \nmay  not  use  the  same  authority  to  amend  the  statute  because  of  a  basic  rule  of  law \n15\n\n  \nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 16 of 25     PageID 894\nproposition:  It  cannot  be  the  case  that  the  governed  break  the  law  when  they  comply  with \nCongress’s  law  as  written.  That is  why  the  24/7  Requirement  runs  afoul  of Section  706. \nA nursing  home,  reading  the  law  Congress  passed,  discerns  it  must  supply  an  RN  at \nleast  eight  hours  a  day,  seven  days  a  week.  So  it  employs  one  for  that  period.  But  then  it \ndiscovers  it  is  noncompliant  because  it  is  not  meeting  CMS’s  24-hour  baseline.  In  that  case, \nfull  compliance  with  the  politically  accountable  branch  means  breaking  the  decrees  of the \nnonpolitically  accountable  one.  That  is  not  how  the  relationship  between  Congress  and \nagencies  works.  Agencies  can,  for example,  explain  what  compliance  with  providing “dietary \nservices”  or  establishing  an  “infection  control  program”  looks  like  via  regulation.  42  U.S.C. \n§  1396r(b)(4),  (d)(3)(A).  But  it  cannot  “rewrite  clear  statutory  terms  to  suit  its  own  sense  of \nhow  the  statute  should  operate.” In  re Benjamin,  932  F.3d  293,  300  (5th  Cir.  2019).  Doing  so \nwould  place  nursing homes  in  the  untenable  position  of fully  complying with  a  statute while \nsimultaneously  violating  the  regulation.  Whatever  authority  Defendants’  cited  provisions \ngrant,  it  is  not that. \nFor this  reason,  Defendants’  argument  that  Plaintiffs’  position would  require  reading \nthe  words  “at  least”  out  of the  statute  fails.  Congress  setting  a  baseline  that  nursing homes \n“use  the  services  of a  [RN]  for  at  least  8  consecutive  hours  a  day”  only  means  nursing homes \nmust  meet  that  bottom  line.  It  does  not  mean  the  agency  is  free  to  raise  that  line  higher. \nCongress’s  authorization for  nursing homes to  employ an RN  for more than  eight hours  daily \nis  not authorization for the  agency to  demand more.  Congress  chose  the  specific baseline,  and \nthe agency cannot invoke general  authority to change that specific line. See RadLAX Gateway \nHotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S.  639,  645—46 (2012) (explaining that the “[gleneral \nlanguage  of a  statutory  provision  .  .  .  will  not  be  held  to  apply  to  a  matter  specifically  dealt \nwith  in  another  part  of the  same  enactment”  (alteration  in  original)  (quoting D.  Ginsberg  & \nSons,  Inc.  v.  Popkin,  285  U.S.  204,  208  (1932)));  cf.  ANTONIN  SCALIA  &  BRYAN  A.

Med.  Ass’n  v.  U.S.  Dep’t  of Health  &  Hum.  Servs.,  120 \nF.4th  494,  508  (5th  Cir.  2024).  Little  is  more  unambiguous  than  the  statute  here.  Congress \nset  the  baseline  number  of  hours  a  nursing  home  must  employ  an  RN  at  “8.”  42  U.S.C. \n§  1895i-3(b)(4)(C)i).  The  agency changed the number.  But in doing so,  it amended the statute \nand rendered a nursing home’s compliance with the statute a lawbreaking endeavor.  It meant \n  \nnursing  homes  could  not  “be  sure  of the  rules  that  bind  them.”  Loper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at \n2285  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring)  (highlighting  the  fear  that  if  “bureaucrats”  assign  new \nmeaning “without  any  legislative  revision”  then  people  could  never be  sure  of how  to  comply \nwith  the  law).  Only  Congress  can  amend  its  laws  because  “the  Constitution  promises[]  the \nAmerican  people  are  sovereign  and  they  alone  may,  through  democratically  responsive \nprocesses,  ...  revise  federal  legislation.”  Loper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at  2279  (Gorsuch,  J., \nconcurring)  (emphasis  added).  The  agency  admits  the  24/7  Requirement “revises”  Congress’s \nrequirement.  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40898.  Thus,  it  cannot  stand. \nII.  The  HPRD  Requirements  Strike  Consideration  of  Factors  Congress \nRequires \nPlaintiffs  argue  the  HPRD  Requirements  fail  for  many  of  the  same  reasons.  They \nclaim Congress has “opted for a flexible qualitative standard” when it required nursing homes \nto  provide  nursing  services  “sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing  needs  of  [their]  residents.”  ECF \nNo.  57-1  at  36;  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  Instead,  Plaintiffs  argue,  the  HPRD \nRequirements  put a blanket mandate  across  all nursing homes,  disregarding their individual \n“nursing  needs.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  The  HPRD  Requirements  “substitute[] \n17\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 18 of 25     PageID 896\nCMS’s  current  policy  views  for  Congress’s  considered judgment”  and  “replac[e]  that  flexible \nstandard  with a  rule  of almost  comical  rigidity  and  specificity.”  ECF  No.  57-1  at  36.  They  do \nso  by  “requiring every  nursing home  in the  country  to  provide  ‘a  minimum  of 3.48  hours  per \nresident  day  for  total  nurse  staffing[,]  including  but  not  limited  to—(i)  [a]  minimum  of 0.55 \nhours  per  resident day for registered  nurses;  and  (ii)  [a]  minimum  of 2.45  hours  per resident \nday  for  nurse  aids.”  Id.  (quoting  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40996).  This  blanket  requirement  fails  to \n“accommodate[]  the  wide  variation  in  resident  needs  across  different  States,  localities,  and \nfacilities.” Id.  Plaintiffs  claim  the  agency has  no  such  authority to  replace  a flexible  standard \nwith  a  universal,  unflinching one. \nDefendants  think  they  do.  And  they invoke  the  same  provisions  invoked  vis-a-vis  the \n24/7 Requirement:  42 U.S.C.  Section  1396r(d)(4)(B),  which grants the authority to implement \n“such  other  requirements  relating  to  the  health  and  safety  of  residents  or  relating  to  the \nphysical  facilities  thereof  as  the  Secretary  may  find  necessary”  and  42  U.S.C.  Section \n1396r(f)(1)  wherein  Congress  declared  “[i]t  is  the  duty  and  responsibility  of the  Secretary  to \nassure  that  requirements...  are  adequate  to  protect  the  health,  safety,  welfare,  and  rights \nof  residents  and  to  promote  the  effective  and  efficient  use  of  public  moneys.”  See  also  42 \nU.S.C.  §  1395i-3(d)(4)(B),  (f)(1).  They  note  Plaintiffs  do  not  contest  whether  these  provisions \ngrant  CMS  the  authority  to  impose  the  HPRD  Requirements.  ECF  No.  80-1  at  27.  They \nadvance  that  Plaintiffs’  argument  is  flawed  because  the  HPRD  Requirements  do  not \nsubstitute  the  agency’s  policy  views  for  Congress’s  as  the  HPRD  Requirements  “are  not  a \n‘rigid  one-size-fits  all’  approach.” Id.  at  28  (quoting  ECF  No.  57-1  at  37).  They  are  not  a  one- \nsize-fits-all  approach  because  they  are  based  on  “the  actual  number  of  residents  in  the \nfacility”  and  thus  “adjusted  for  [the]  size  of  [the]  facility.”  Id.  at  28  (quoting  89  Fed.  Reg. \n40908—09).  Because a nursing home may still need to impose higher staffing to have sufficient \n staff,  the  HPRD  Requirements  and  Congress’s  flexible  standard  can  “comfortably  coexist.”\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 19 of 25     PageID 897\nId.  They  again  point  to  the  same  examples  where  the  agency has  “fill[ed]  up  the  details”  of a \ncongressional  mandate.  Id.  at  29-30. \nAgain,  this  is  not  a  “fill  up  the  details”  scenario.  Jd.  at  29.  Congress  requires  nursing \nhomes  to  “provide  24-hour  licensed  nursing  services  which  are  sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing \nneeds  of  its  residents.”  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4)(C)i)  (emphasis  added);  id.  §  1395i- \n8(b)(4)(C)().  The  text  reveals  factors  that  nursing  homes  must  consider.  It  requires \ndetermination  of the “nursing needs” of a facility’s residents.  The  “nursing needs” necessarily \nencompass a  range  of  detailed  evaluations.  “Resident  care  needs  [can]  vary  depending  on \nacuity,  clinical complexity,  and other resident characteristics,” to name a  few.  Admin.  Rec.  at \n70006.  “[Hligher-acuity  or  more  clinically  complex  residents”  can  affect  what  a  facility’s \n“nursing  needs”  are.  Id.  The  agency  has  agreed  these  factors  can  affect  a  facilitys  nursing \nneeds  in  the  past.  See,  e.g.,  39  Fed.  Reg.  at  2239  (rejecting  requirements  like  the  HPRD \nRequirements  “because the  variation from  facility to facility in the  composition of its nursing \nstaff, physical  layout,  patient needs  and the services necessary to meet those needs precludes \nsetting  such”  a  regulation).  Indeed,  one  of Defendants’  cited  studies  admits  a  need  for  more \ndata “to  develop  an algorithm for relating minimum  nursing staff requirements  to  case mix.” \nINST.  OF MED.,  IMPROVING THE  QUALITY OF  CARE  IN NURSING HOMES  102  (1986).  Instead  of \nimposing  blanket  ratios  across  all  facilities,  the  study  recommended  a  more  fine-tuned \nalgorithm  capable  of considering  sufficient  factors  that  affect  the  nursing  needs  of a  facility. \nDefendants  claim  they  have  sufficient  data  now.  ECF  No.  80-1  at  34  (“Now  that  adequate \ndata  is  available...  .”). \nBut the  HPRD  Requirements  do  not exhibit  adequate  data are  available because  they \ndo  not account for  an individual  facility's  nursing needs.  If adequate  data  were  available,  the \nregulation  would  produce  a  minimum  staffing  level  that  considered  the  “case-mix”  of  a \n19\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 20 of 25     PageID 898\nfacility.  But the agency proclaims the HPRD Requirements  do not consider a  facility’s nursing \nneeds.  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40877  (“[T]he  standards  themselves  will be implemented  and  enforced \nindependent  of  a  facility's  case-mix.”).  The  HPRD  Requirements  set  one  rule  for  all. \nDefendants’  argument that  it is  not  a blanket rule  because  it  considers a  facility's  number of \nresidents  is  not  convincing.  The  HPRD  Requirements  mandate  a  certain  number  of staffing \nhours  per  facility  resident  for  different  types  of  nursing  staff.  Every  nursing  home  must \ncomply,  aside  from  the  exemption  provisions.  To  comply,  nursing  homes  must  count  their \nresidents  and  then  multiply by  CMS’s  cutoff number  for  each  nursing  staff type  to  calculate \nthe  total  hours  required  per  day.  See  42  C.F.R.  §  483.5  (defining  hours  per  resident  day  as \n“the  total  number  of  hours  worked  by  each  type  of  staff  divided  by  the  total  number  of \nresidents  as  calculated  by  CMS”). \nThe  agency  lacks  authority  to  eliminate  consideration  of a  facility's  nursing  “needs” \nwhen  prescribing  minimum  staffing  standards.  42  U.S.C.  §  1396r(b)(4)(C)()().  Congress \nstipulated  that  the  “[rlequired  nursing  care”  standard  must  contemplate  “the  nursing needs \nof  [a  facility’s]  residents.”  Id.  at  §  1396r(b)(4)(C),  (b)(4)(C)@().  This  provision  specifically \ngoverns  the  minimum  standard of nursing care.  See RadLax,  566  U.S.  at  646.  But the  HPRD \nRequirements  in  effect  strike  that  portion  of the  statute.  They  do  not  consider  the  nursing \n“needs”  of a facility’s  residents.  42  U.S.C.  §  1896r(b)(4)(C)@)(D.  Instead,  they mandate hours- \nper-resident-day  ratios  for  all  facilities.  In  so  doing,  they  set  a  baseline  staffing requirement \nthat does not follow the  statute’s  terms.  True,  other requirements may demand a  facility staff \nhigher  than  the  baseline  HPRD  Requirements.  See  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40891  (“We  expect  that \nmany  facilities  will  need  to  staff above  the  minimum  standards  to  meet  the  acuity  needs  of \ntheir  residents  depending  on  case-mix  and  as  mandated  by  the  facility  assessment  required \nat  §  483.71.”).  But  whether  other  requirements  comply  with  the  statute  or  not,  CMS  cannot \nset  a  baseline  that  neglects  “needs”  Congress  mandated.  42  U.S.C.  §  1896r(b)(4)(C)(i)(D. \n20\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 21 of 25     PageID 899\nAgain,  none  of  this  determines  the  scope  of  authority  Defendants’  cited  provisions \ngrant.  Those  provisions  do  textually  grant broad  authority.  Cf.  Missouri,  595  U.S.  at  93.  But \nno  matter  how  broad  that  authority,  it  cannot  authorize  altering  Congress’s  exercise  of its \nown  authority.  That  is  what  the  HPRD  Requirements  do  when  they  set  minimum  staffing \nlevels  flouting  the  factors  Congress  requires  be  considered.  Of course,  agencies  can  “fill  up \nthe  details”  of  a  statutory  scheme,  just  as  the  agency  did  when  it  issued  regulations  on \nnursing  homes’  infection  control  programs  and  dietary  services.  ECF  No.  80-1  at  29.  This \nmay  even  mean  adding  additional  requirements  Congress  did  not  contemplate.  See,  e.g., \nMissouri,  595  U.S.  at  93-96  (holding  the  agency  could  require  healthcare  workers  to  receive \nthe  coronavirus  vaccination  though  Congress  never  specifically  imposed  healthcare-worker \nvaccination  requirements).  Here,  the  agency  likely  could  remain  within  its  authority  if  it \nissued  regulations  specifying  how  a  facility  should  analyze  the  “nursing  needs  of  its \nresidents.” 42  U.S.C.  §  1896r(b)(4)(C)(i).  That would  likely constitute “fill[ing]  up  the  details” \nof a  statutory  scheme.  Loper  Bright,  144  S.  Ct.  at  2263  (internal  quotation  omitted).  But  it \nmay  not  set  a  baseline  that  ignores  residents’  nursing  needs.  An  agency  exercise  of \ndiscretionary  authority  to  elucidate  details  can  never  mean  stripping  away  statutory  text. \n“Filling  up”  details  is  not  statutory  substitution.  Addition  is  not  subtraction.  Agencies  may \nadd  to statutes consistent with their delegated authority  and  other laws.  They may never cut \nstatutes  to  replace  them  with their  own  requirements. \nIII.  Major  Questions  Doctrine  and Arbitrary  and  Capricious  Review \nPlaintiffs  raise  the  major  questions  doctrine  as  a  separate  argument  against  CMS’s \nassertion of authority in the Final Rule.  ECF No.  57-1  at  38-41.  The major questions doctrine \nrequires  “clear  congressional  authorization”  instead  of  “a  merely  plausible  textual  basis” \nwhen  agencies  “claim[]  the  power to  resolve  a matter of great political  significance” or “seek[] \n  \nto  regulate  a  significant  portion  of  the  American  economy  or  require  billions  of dollars  in\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 22 of 25     PageID 900\nspending  by  private  persons  or  entities.”  West  Virginia,  597  U.S.  at  723;  id.  at  743,  744 \n(Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring)  (internal  quotations  omitted).  And  when,  as  here,  Congress \nrepeatedly  declines  to  authorize  the  challenged  agency  action,  then  that  “may be a  sign  that \nan  agency  is  attempting  to  ‘work  [a]round’  the  legislative  process  to  resolve  for  itself  a \nquestion  of  great  political  significance.”  West  Virginia,  597  U.S.  at  743  (Gorsuch,  J., \nconcurring)  (alteration in  original)  (quoting Natl Fed’n  of Indep.  Bus.  v.  Occupational Safety \n&  Health Admin.,  595  U.S.  109,  122  (2022)  (Gorsuch,  J.,  concurring)). \nHowever,  because  the  Final  Rule  contravenes  statutory  provisions  aside  from  the \nagency’s claim of authority,  the Court need not examine “ambiguous statutory text” to discern \nwhether  “the  delegation  claimed  to  be  lurking  there”  exists.  Jd.  at  723  (quoting  Util.  Air \nRegul.  Grp.  v.  Env’t  Prot.  Agency,  573  U.S.  302,  324  (2014)).  The  major  questions  doctrine \nuses  context  to  aid  “interpreting  the  scope  of a  delegation.” Biden  v.  Nebraska,  600  U.S.  477, \n513  (2023)  (Barrett,  J.,  concurring).  However,  when  Congress  itself legislates  “the.  details,” \nthe  question  of  whether  it  “delegat[ed]  [them]  away”  answers  itself.  Id.  at  515  (quoting \nWayman,  23  U.S.  (10  Wheat.)  1  (1825)).  For  that  reason,  the  Court  need  not  address  those \narguments  here. \nFor  the  same  reason,  because  the  Final  Rule’s  challenged  provisions  contravene \nCongress’s  prescriptions,  the  Court  “does  not  consider  the  parties’  remaining  arguments \nregarding arbitrary and capricious rulemaking.” Tenn.  Walking Horse Nat'l  Celebration Ass’n \nv.  U.S.  Dep’t  of Agric.,  No.  2:24-CV-143,  2025  WL  360895,  at  *4  (N.D.  Tex.  Jan.  31,  2025) \n(citing Nat Ass’n  of Priv.  Fund  Managers  v.

Cir.  2004)  (Roberts,  J.,  concurring  in  part  and  in  the \njudgment). \nIV.  Vacatur  Is  the Appropriate  Relief \nJudicial restraint is relevant for considering the appropriate relief as well.  Defendants \nargue  that  if this  Court  holds  the  24/7  Requirement  and  the  HPRD  Requirements  contrary \nto  the APA,  then  any relief should  be curtailed to  the parties  and  challenged  provisions.  ECF \nNo.  80-1  at  57-58.  They  also  contend  that  the  APA  “does  not  authorize  any  particular  form \nof relief.” Id.  at  56  (emphasis  in  original);  see  also  Transcript  of Oral Argument at  36,  United \nStates  v.  Texas,  599  U.S.  670  (2028)  (No.  22-58)  (Chief Justice  Roberts  reacting  “[w]ow”  in \nresponse  to  this  argument).  But  see  Texas,  599  U.S.  at  686,  701-02  (Gorsuch,  Thomas  & \nBarrett,  JJ.,  concurring)  (questioning  vacatur  while  recognizing  it  is  not  a  universal \ninjunction  and  that  whether  the  APA  authorizes  vacatur  is  not  “open  and  shut”  with \n“[t]houghtful  arguments  and  scholarship”  on both  sides). \nThe  Supreme  Court  “will  have  to  address”  the  “serious  questions”  about  vacatur  and \nuniversal  injunctions  “sooner  or  later.”  Id.  at  702.  Until  then,  the  Fifth  Circuit’s  precedents \ngovern  this  Court.  The  Fifth  Circuit  has  consistently  held  that  “vacatur  under  [Section] \n706(2)  [is]  a  remedy  that  affects  individuals  beyond  those  who  are  parties  to  the  immediate \ndispute.” Braidwood Mgmt.,  Inc.  v.  Becerra,  104  F.4th  930,  951  (5th  Cir.  2024),  cert. granted, \nNo.  24-316,  2025  WL  65918  (U.S.  Jan.  10,  2025),  and  cert.  denied  sub  nom.  Braidwood \nMGMT.  Inc.  v.  Becerra,  No.  24-475,  2025 WL  76462  (U.S.  Jan.  13,  2025).  It “empowers  courts \nto set aside—i.e., formally nullify and revoke—an unlawful agency action.” Data Mktg.  P’ship, \nLP v.  U.S.  Dep’t of Lab.,  45  F.4th 846,  859  (5th Cir.  2022) (quoting Jonathan  F.  Mitchell,  The \nWrit-of-Erasure Fallacy,  104 VA. L. REV.  933,  950 (2018)).  And it operates nationwide because \nit  “operates  on  the  status  of  agency  action  in  the  abstract.”  Braidwood,  104  F.4th  at  951. \n23\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 24 of 25     PageID 902\nCompare  Texas  v.

Tex.  2024)  (preliminarily \nenjoining  only  as  to  plaintiff parties). \nAs  the  Fifth  Circuit  has  “repeatedly  described  it,”  vacatur  is  the  default  “remedy  for \nunlawful  agency  action.”  Id.  at  952  (citing  cases).  It  does  not  require  consideration  of  the \nequities because  as  the Fifth  Circuit  “conceptualizes  it,”  it is  not “a remedy familiar to  courts \nsitting  in  equity.”  Id.  Because  the  “default  rule  is  that  vacatur  is  the  appropriate  remedy,” \nthis  Court  finds  no  reason  to  depart  pending changes  in  precedent.  Data  Mktg.,  45  F.4th  at \n859. \nBut a question remains about what this  Court must vacate.  Defendants  argue vacatur \nshould  be  limited to  the  challenged provisions  of the  Final  Rule.  Plaintiffs  challenge  the  24/7 \nRequirement  and the HPRD  Requirements  only.  ECF Nos.  57-1  at  11;  96 at 41.  And the  Final \nRule  contains  a  severability  clause.  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40913.  This  Court  has  not  analyzed  the \nunchallenged  provisions  of  the  Final  Rule  to  determine  if  they  flout  the  APA.  And  the \n“severance  and  invalidation  of [the  challenged  requirements]  will  not  impair  the  function  of \n[Medicare  and  Medicaid  participation  conditions]  as  a  whole.” K Mart  Corp.  v.  Cartier,  Inc., \n486  U.S.  281,  294 (1988).  Even more,  the  Final Rule itself reveals that “there is  no indication \nthat  the  regulation  would  not  have  been  passed  but  for”  the  “inclusion”  of  the  offending \nprovisions.  Id.;  see  also  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40913.  Thus,  vacatur  is  limited  to  the  24/7 \nRequirement  and  the  HPRD  Requirements. \n24\n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR     Document 101     Filed 04/07/25      Page 25 of 25     PageID 903\nCONCLUSION \nAccordingly,  the  Court  GRANTS  Plaintiffs’  Motion  and  DENIES  Defendants’ \nCross-Motion.

On May 10, 2024, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n(“CMS”) issued a rule imposing onerous new minimum-staffing requirements on \nvirtually all U.S. nursing homes.  See 89 Fed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024) (“Final \nRule”).    That  rule  exceeds  CMS’s  statutory  authority,  effects  a  baffling  and \nunexplained  departure  from  the  agency’s  longstanding  position,  and  creates \nimpossible-to-meet standards that will harm thousands of nursing homes and the \nvulnerable Americans they serve. \n2.  Decades ago, Congress established two basic staffing requirements for \nnursing homes that participate in Medicare or Medicaid—as more than 97% of U.S. \nnursing homes do.  First, a nursing home “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse [(“RN”)] for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  \n42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).  Second, a nursing \nhome “must provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to meet \nthe  nursing  needs  of  its  residents.”    Id.  §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i);  accord  id.  §1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i).   \n3.  Over  the  years,  Congress  has  considered  alternative  regulatory \napproaches,  including  proposals  to  replace  the  flexible  sufficient-staffing \nrequirement with a one-size-fits-all numerical minimum staffing requirement.  But \neach time, Congress has declined to adopt such proposals, and instead concluded \n1 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 3 of 57   PageID 181\n \nthat the adequacy of nursing home staffing should be determined flexibly based on \nthe particularized needs of each facility.   \n4.  Dissatisfied with Congress’ judgment, CMS decided to take matters \ninto its own hands.  At the direction of the President, the agency proposed and has \nnow adopted a rule that overrides both of Congress’ statutory requirements.  \n5.  The  Final  Rule  explicitly—and  brazenly—“revises”  the  first \nrequirement by tripling it, replacing Congress’ directive to employ an RN for 8 \nconsecutive hours, 7 days a week, with CMS’s own directive to have an RN “onsite \n24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40898, 40997.  And the Final \nRule  departs  from  the  second  statutory  staffing  requirement  too,  replacing  the \nflexible  qualitative  standard  Congress  chose  with  three  rigid  quantitative \nrequirements.  Instead of following Congress’ decision to require nursing services \n“sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing  needs”  of  each  facility’s  residents,  42  U.S.C. \n§1396r(b)(4)(C)(i), the Final Rule demands that every facility across the nation—\nregardless of its residents’ actual needs—provide (i) total nurse staffing of at least \n3.48 hours per resident day (“HPRD”), including (ii) RN staffing of at least 0.55 \nHPRD and (iii) nurse aide (“NA”) staffing of at least 2.45 HPRD.  89 Fed. Reg. at \n40877.   \n6.  CMS does not even try to claim that the statutory provisions in which \nCongress  explicitly  addressed  staffing  requirements  empower  it  to  enact  these \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 4 of 57   PageID 182\n \nsweeping new mandates.  CMS instead claims that this power is lurking in “various \nprovisions” of the Medicare and Medicaid Acts that enable the agency to promulgate \nrequirements promoting resident health and safety.  Id. at 40879, 40890-91.  But that \nargument  runs  headlong  into  basic  principles  of  administrative  law,  as  generic \nrulemaking provisions do not empower agencies to “revise” legislative enactments \nand promote their own policy du jour over the policy choices that Congress enacted \ninto federal law.   \n7.  That is particularly clear here given the long history of congressional \naction in this area, the staggering breadth of the regulatory authority CMS now \nasserts, and the massive economic and political significance of that assertion.  Even \nby CMS’s low-ball estimate, nursing homes will need to spend more than $40 billion \nover the next decade to comply with these new staffing requirements.  Congress has \nnever delegated to CMS the authority to impose such onerous and unachievable \nmandates on practically every nursing home in the country. \n8.  Even  if  Congress  had  delegated  CMS  the  authority  it  claims,  the \nagency’s decision to adopt the new minimum-staffing standards was arbitrary and \ncapricious, in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  It simply \nmakes no sense to impose a blanket 24/7 RN requirement and rigid staffing ratios on \nthousands and thousands of nursing homes across the country, regardless of each \nparticular facility’s local conditions and unique circumstances.  As CMS and its \n3 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 5 of 57   PageID 183\n \npredecessor agencies have repeatedly explained in a series of regulations spanning \nmore than four decades, the indisputable fact that nursing homes care for a wide \nrange of resident populations with greatly divergent needs renders a one-size-fits-all \napproach manifestly inappropriate.  The Final Rule is an unjustified about-face from \nthat  longstanding  agency  position,  which  has  engendered  significant  reliance \ninterests.   \n9.  Those problems are only exacerbated by the irrational and unattainable \nstaffing levels that the Final Rule imposes.  As CMS openly acknowledges, its new \nmandates “exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all” of the \n38 States (plus the District of Columbia) that have adopted such requirements, and \nwill  require  increased  staffing  “in  more  than  79  percent  of  nursing  facilities \nnationwide.”  Id. at 40877.  Setting one-size-fits-all staffing requirements that will \nrequire some four-fifths of the nation’s nursing homes to hire additional personnel, \neven though almost no state has deemed those higher levels necessary in light of its \nparticular local conditions, and CMS itself has found that most nursing homes are \nalready providing more-than-adequate care with their present staffing levels, is the \nheight of arbitrary and capricious agency action.   \n10.  Still worse, CMS failed to adequately account for the ongoing shortage \nof RNs and NAs—a shortage that will be exacerbated by the artificial demand that \nthe  agency’s  mandate  will  produce  nationwide,  making  compliance  practically \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 6 of 57   PageID 184\n \nimpossible in many parts of the country.  Texas is a case in point: The Final Rule \nestimates that nursing homes in Texas will need to hire about 2,579 additional RNs, \nrepresenting an increase of 46.1% over current staffing, as well as 7,887 additional \nNAs, for an increase of 28.4%.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40957, 40976-80.  Texas simply \ndoes not have enough RNs and NAs to sustain these massive increases.  On the other \nhand, Texas has a relatively high proportion of licensed vocational nurses (“LVNs”),1 \nbut the Final Rule largely ignores their important contributions to resident care.  \nFurther,  the  Final  Rule  will  have  a  disproportionate  impact  on  smaller,  rural \nfacilities, which will struggle to compete with larger, better-funded urban facilities \nvying to attract new hires from the limited pool of RNs and NAs.  See AHCA \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  21,  31  (Nov.  6,  2023),  (“AHCA  Cmt.”), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-43877;  LeadingAge \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  7  (“LeadingAge  Cmt.”), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-22293.2 \n \n1 Most states use the term “licensed practical nurse” (“LPN”), but Texas and \nCalifornia use the term LVN.  See 87 Fed. Reg. 22720, 22790 (Apr. 15, 2022).  LPNs \nand LVNs generally have 1-2 years of postsecondary education, e.g., an associate’s \ndegree, whereas NAs generally have only a high school diploma and have completed \na state certification program.  See id. \n2 See also, e.g., Elizabeth Dougherty, If You Build It: Rural Hospitals Are Closing, \nbut Those That Remain Are Reshaping and Innovating, Harvard Medicine: Rural \nHealth Issue, Spring 2017 (“Approximately 77 percent of rural countries in the \nUnited States are so-called medical deserts, owing to a shortage of primary care \nprofessionals.”); Lina Khan, Q&A with Lina Khan, Chair of the U.S. Federal Trade \n \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 7 of 57   PageID 185\n \n11.  Even  if  nursing  homes  could  somehow  find  enough  qualified \njobseekers to meet CMS’s arbitrary RN and NA thresholds, they are in no position \nto absorb the annual costs of doing so, which by CMS’s own (unduly low) estimate \nwill amount to over $5 billion each year. \n12.  To be clear, all agree that nursing homes need an adequate supply of \nwell-trained  staff.    But  imposing  a  nationwide,  multi-billion-dollar,  unfunded \nmandate at a time when nursing homes are already struggling with staffing shortages \nand financial constraints will only make the situation worse.  If CMS’s new standards \nare permitted to take effect, hundreds of nursing homes will likely be forced to \ndownsize or close their doors entirely.  That threatens to displace tens of thousands \nof nursing home residents from their current facilities, while forcing countless other \nseniors and family members to wait longer, search farther, and pay more for the care \nthey need.  The Final Rule thus promises to be a nightmare not only for owners and \noperators of nursing homes, but also for the vulnerable residents they serve, in direct \nderogation of CMS’s statutory mandate.   \n13.  In  short,  the  staffing  requirements  in  the  Final  Rule  flunk  basic \nprinciples of administrative law at every turn.

LeadingAge brings this action on behalf of its member facilities, to prevent \nthe economic and other injuries that the Final Rule will cause them absent judicial \nrelief. \n16.  Plaintiff  Texas  Health  Care  Association  (“THCA”)  is  the  largest \nassociation of long-term care providers in the State of Texas.  It maintains its \nprincipal place of business at 1108 Lavaca Street, Suite 500, Austin, TX 78701.  \nTHCA represents several hundred licensed non-profit and for-profit skilled nursing \nfacilities, specialized rehabilitation facilities, and assisted living facilities in Texas.  \nMany of THCA’s member facilities participate in both Medicare and Medicaid, \nwhile some participate only in Medicare and some participate only in Medicaid.  \nTHCA brings this action on behalf of its member facilities, to prevent the economic \nand other injuries that the Final Rule will cause them absent judicial relief. \n17.

Arbrook Plaza is a member of AHCA and THCA, with its \nprincipal place of business at 401 W Arbrook Blvd, Arlington, TX 76014. \n18.  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District is a political subdivision of the State \nof Texas, located in Lipscomb County.  See Tex. Spec. Dist. Code §§1003.003, \n1003.004.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action under 28 U.S.C. §1331 and \nhas authority to grant the relief requested under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \nU.S.C. §§701-706, and the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§2201-2202.   \n25.  While Congress has restricted federal-question jurisdiction over claims \nthat arise under only the Medicare Act, see 42 U.S.C. §1395ii, that provision does \nnot apply to the present lawsuit for two independent reasons.  First, §1395ii does not \nbar facilities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid from bringing a pre-\nenforcement challenge that “arises under both Acts,” “has an independent basis in \nthe Medicaid Act[,] and is not inextricably intertwined with a claim for benefits \nunder the Medicare Act.”  Avon Nursing & Rehab. v. Becerra, 995 F.3d 305, 312 (2d \nCir. 2021); accord Texas v. Becerra, 575 F.Supp.3d 701, 712 (N.D. Tex. 2021) \n(Kacsmaryk, J.).  Second, §1395ii does not apply to entities that participate only in \nMedicaid (and not Medicare), as their challenges indisputably arise only under the \nMedicaid Act.  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District operates a Medicaid-only facility \n(namely, Twin Oaks).  Plaintiff LeadingAge has several member facilities (including \nTwin Oaks) that participate only in Medicaid.  Plaintiffs AHCA and THCA likewise \nhave Medicaid-only members. \n26.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. §1391(e) because (1) the Defendants \nare federal agencies and federal officers sued in their official capacity; (2) Plaintiffs \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 12 of 57   PageID 190\n \nArbrook Plaza, Booker Hospital District, and Harbor Lakes reside in this District; \nand (3) a substantial part of the events giving rise to the claim occurred in this \nDistrict. \nBACKGROUND \nA.   Overview of the Medicare and Medicaid Programs \n27.  In  1965,  Congress  created  the  Medicare  and  Medicaid  programs \nthrough amendments to the Social Security Act.  See generally Pub. L. No. 89-97, \n79 Stat. 286 (July 30, 1965).  Medicare is a federal program that provides health \ninsurance to individuals 65 and older, as well as those with certain disabilities or \nconditions.  See 42 U.S.C. §1395c.  Medicaid is a joint federal-state program that \nprovides health insurance to low-income individuals.  See id. §§1396-1, 1396a.   \n28.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicare must meet the \nstatutory requirements for “skilled nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. §1395i-\n3.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicaid must meet the largely parallel \nset of statutory requirements for “nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. §1396r.  \nCollectively, skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities are referred to as “long-\nterm care” (“LTC”) facilities.  See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 22720, 22790 (Apr. 15, 2022).   \n29.  CMS  has  promulgated  a  single  set  of  consolidated  Medicare  and \nMedicaid  regulations  that  apply  to  all  LTC  facilities  that  participate  in  either \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 13 of 57   PageID 191\n \nprogram, or both.  See 42 C.F.R. § 483.1.  More than 97% of nursing homes in the \nUnited States participate in at least one of the two programs.3 \nB.  Historical Federal Regulation of Nursing Home Staffing \n30.  For more than half a century, Congress—not CMS or its predecessors—\nhas taken the lead in setting staffing requirements for nursing homes that participate \nin the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  In 1972, Congress amended the Social \nSecurity Act to require all “skilled nursing facilities” (“SNFs”) participating in either \nor both programs to “provide[] 24-hour nursing service which is sufficient to meet \nnursing needs in accordance with the [facility’s patient care] policies” and to have \n“at  least  one  registered  professional  nurse  employed  full  time.”    42  U.S.C. \n§1395x(j)(6)  (1976)  (Medicare);  see  id.  §1396a(a)(28)  (1976)  (requiring  state \nMedicaid plans to define “skilled nursing facility” by reference to the Medicare \ndefinition).  Congress empowered the Secretary to waive these staffing requirements \n“to the extent they … require that any skilled nursing facility engage the services of \na registered professional nurse for more than 40 hours a week,” but only with respect \nto SNFs in rural areas that met enumerated conditions.  See Pub. L. No. 92-603, \n§267, 86 Stat. 1329, 1450 (Oct. 30, 1972). \n \n3 See Nat’l Center for Health Stats., U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Post-\nacute and Long-term Care Providers and Services Users in the United States, 2017-\n2018, at 9-10 (2022) (stating that 97.8% of nursing facilities are certified under \nMedicare and 95.4% are certified under Medicaid). \n12 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 14 of 57   PageID 192\n \n31.  In  1973,  the  Social  Security  Administration  (“SSA”)  proposed \nregulations  that  mirrored  Congress’  decisions  on  nursing  home  staffing \nrequirements.  See 38 Fed. Reg. 18620 (July 12, 1973) (SNFs).  Just like the statute, \nthese proposed regulations required SNFs to provide “24-hour nursing service which \nis sufficient to meet nursing needs in accordance with the [facility’s patient care] \npolicies” and at least one “qualified registered nurse employed full-time”—i.e., \n“during the day tour of duty 5 days a week.”  Id. at 18625.  During the notice-and-\ncomment period, however, the agency received comments urging it to deviate from \nCongress’ approach by requiring all nursing homes to maintain “a specific ratio of \nnursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, 1974). \n32.  The  agency  considered  and  expressly  rejected  that  one-size-fits-all \napproach, explaining that “the variation from facility to facility in the composition \nof its nursing staff, physical layout, patient needs[,] and the services necessary to \nmeet those needs precludes setting such a figure.”  Id.  The agency also expressed \nconcern that “[a] minimum ratio could result in all facilities striving only to reach \nthat minimum and could result in other facilities hiring unneeded staff to satisfy an \narbitrary ratio.”  Id. \n33.  In 1980, HHS took over the administration of Medicare and Medicaid.  \nIt  promptly  “propos[ed]  a  general  revision”  of  the  regulations  governing  SNF \nparticipation in Medicare and Medicaid.  See generally 45 Fed. Reg. 47368 (July 14, \n13 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 15 of 57   PageID 193\n \n1980).  Consistent with SSA’s approach in the 1974 rulemaking, HHS declined to \npropose “any nursing staff ratios or minimum number of nursing hours per patient \nper day.”  Id. at 47371.  Instead, it proposed “retain[ing] the language in the existing \nregulations,” which closely tracked the governing statutes.  Id.; see also id. at 47378 \n(requiring “24-hour nursing service with a sufficient number of qualified nursing \npersonnel to meet the total nursing needs of the patient,” as well as “a registered \nnurse  full-time,  7  days  a  week  on  the  day  shift”).   At  the  same  time,  HHS \nacknowledged that “[s]ome States ha[d] chosen to employ [quantitative staffing] \nstandards,” invited them to share their experiences, and announced its intention “to \nundertake a study on this subject.”  Id. at 47371-72. \n34.  As HHS later acknowledged, the agency’s proposed overhaul of the \nSNF regulations in 1980 was “surrounded by controversy” and “met with strong \nopposition from a variety of sources.”  52 Fed. Reg. 38582, 38583 (Oct. 16, 1987).  \nIn response, Congress adopted legislation expressly prohibiting HHS from using any \nappropriated funds to finalize the proposed rule “prior to [its] receipt of revised cost \nestimates” and a “General Accounting Office evaluation of the[ir] impact.” Pub. L. \nNo. 96-536, §119, 94 Stat. 3166 (Dec. 16, 1980).  The proposed rule was never \nfinalized,  but  HHS  nevertheless  followed  through  on  its  plan  to  explore  the \npossibility of minimum-staffing standards, commissioning a multi-year study by the \nInstitute of Medicine (“IoM”).  See 52 Fed. Reg. at 38583. \n14 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 16 of 57   PageID 194\n \n35.  The  IoM  study  ratified  the  agency’s  longstanding  decision  not  to \nimpose a one-size-fits-all staffing standard on America’s nursing homes.  See Inst. \nof Med., Improving the Quality of Care in Nursing Homes 101-03 (Mar. 1986), \nhttps://archive.ph/KFNCi.   The  study  emphasized  the  importance  of  recruiting, \nretaining, and supporting adequate numbers of nursing staff, but concluded that \n“prescribing simple staffing ratios clearly is inappropriate.”  Id. at 102.  It reached \nthis  conclusion  in  part  because  of  “the  complexities  of  case  mix”—that  is, \nindividuals within a single facility have “widely differing needs,” and some facilities \nhave a much “larger proportion of heavy-care residents” than other facilities.  Id. at \n102-03.    The  study  noted  the  possibility  of  “prescribing  sophisticated  staffing \nstandards” that would account for such complexities—e.g., by using “algorithms … \nto estimate amounts of nursing time needed by residents that are based on functional \nassessment scores and requirements for special care needs”—but found that this was \nnot feasible at the time.  Id. at 102. \n36.  In October 1987, HHS again recognized the pitfalls of one-size-fits-all \nstaffing standards in a proposed rule stemming from the results of the IoM study.  \nSee 52 Fed. Reg. at 38586.  At the time, Congress had defined “intermediate care \nfacilities” (“ICFs”) as a class of institutions serving individuals who “require care \nand services (above the level of room and board)” but “do not require the degree of \ncare and treatment which a hospital or [SNF] is designed to provide.”  42 U.S.C. \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 17 of 57   PageID 195\n \n§1396d(c)  (1982).   Although  the  IoM  study  recommended  extending  the  SNF \nrequirement of 24-hour nursing services to ICFs, HHS was hesitant to do so.  HHS \nexplained that it “wish[ed] to provide maximum flexibility for staffing and to avoid \nrequiring 24 hour nurse staffing if there are cases in which the needs of the residents \ncan be met through the use of other personnel.”  52 Fed. Reg. at 38586.  HHS also \nexpressed “concern[] that some facilities would have difficulty in recruiting the \nnurses necessary to meet the requirement and d[id] not wish to create a situation in \nwhich needed nursing home beds are unavailable to program beneficiaries because \nfacilities cannot meet staffing requirements.”  Id.  Despite these qualms, HHS issued \na proposed rule that contemplated extending the existing SNF staffing requirements \nto ICFs, such that both types of facilities “would be required to have a sufficient \nnumber of licensed nurses and other personnel on a 24 hour a day basis, including a \nregistered nurse on duty on the day shift at least 8 hours a day, 7 days a week.”  Id.  \n37.  In  December  1987—less  than  three  months  after  HHS  issued  the \nproposed rule—Congress stepped in once again, enacting extensive revisions to the \nstatutory requirements for nursing homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid.  \nSee Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, 101 Stat. \n1330 (Dec. 22, 1987) (“OBRA ’87”)).  With respect to Medicaid, Congress replaced \nthe two-level framework of SNFs and ICFs with a single definition of “nursing \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 18 of 57   PageID 196\n \nfacilities” (“NFs”), while retaining the term “SNF” in the Medicare context.4  See id. \n§4211(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-183 to 1330-203.  Congress then imposed substantively \nidentical staffing requirements on both SNFs and NFs (collectively known as LTC \nfacilities), requiring each such facility to (1) “provide 24-hour licensed nursing \nservice which is sufficient to meet [the] nursing needs of its residents”; and (2) \n“employ the services of a registered professional nurse at least during the day tour \nof duty (of at least 8 hours a day) 7 days a week.”  Id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-\n161  (SNF  requirement);  accord  id.  §4211(a),  101  Stat.  at  1330-186  (NF \nrequirement). \n38.  Congress  further  demonstrated  its  intent  to  address  nursing  home \nstaffing through legislation—rather than agency regulation—by enacting detailed \nrules for when the Secretary may waive the staffing requirements for SNFs, and \nslightly different rules for when a State may waive the staffing requirements for NFs.  \nCompare id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-163, with id. §4211(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-\n186.  Congress made both types of waivers subject to annual review and renewal.  \nSee id.; accord id. §4201(a), 101 Stat. at 1330-163.  And Congress revisited the \nwaiver issue less than three years later, amending both provisions so that when a \nwaiver is granted, notice must be given to facility residents, members of their \n \n4 OBRA ’87 redefined “intermediate care facilities” as institutions for individuals \nwith intellectual disabilities.

No. 100-203, §4201(e), (h), 101 Stat. at \n1330-203 to 1330-207. \n17 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 19 of 57   PageID 197\n \nimmediate  families,  and  relevant  state  authorities.    See  Omnibus  Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-508, §§4008(h), 4801(a), 104 Stat. \n1388, 1388-49, 1388-211 (Nov. 5, 1990) (“OBRA ’90”).   \n39.  Congress underscored its intent to control nursing home staffing via \nlegislation by instructing the Secretary to “conduct a study and report to Congress \nno later than January 1, 1992, on the appropriateness of establishing minimum \ncaregiver to resident ratios and minimum supervisor to caregiver ratios for [LTC \nfacilities],” and to “include in such study recommendations regarding appropriate \nminimum ratios.”  Pub. L. No. 101-508, §4801(e)(17), 104 Stat. at 1388-218.  HHS \nfailed to comply with Congress’ instructions, however, until 2002—ten years after \nthe statutory deadline.  When the Secretary finally sent Congress a responsive letter, \nhe reported that the study “d[id] not provide enough information to address the \nquestion posed by Congress regarding the appropriateness of establishing minimum \nratios.”5  The Secretary’s letter went on to express “serious reservations about the \nreliability of staffing data at the nursing home level and with the feasibility of \nestablishing staff ratios to improve quality given the variety of quality measures used \n \n5 Letter from Tommy G. Thompson, Sec’y of Health & Human Servs., to J. \nDennis Hastert, Speaker of House of Representatives 1 (Mar. 19, 2002) (“Thompson \nLetter”), reprinted in Office of Asst. Sec’y for Planning & Evaluation, Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs., State Experiences with Minimum Nursing Staff Ratios for \nNursing Facilities: Findings from Case Studies of Eight States app. 1 (Nov. 2003), \nhttps://archive.ph/wip/KQWPt.   \n18 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 20 of 57   PageID 198\n \nand the perpetual shifting of such measures.”  Id.  The Secretary also observed that \nthe study “d[id] not fully address important related issues,” including “the reality of \ncurrent nursing shortages.”  Id.  In light of the Secretary’s report, Congress declined \nto make further changes to the statutory staffing requirements for nursing homes that \nparticipate in Medicare or Medicaid.   \nC.  Statutory Staffing Requirements for Nursing Homes \n40.  The statutory staffing requirements for nursing homes have remained \nsubstantively unchanged since 1990.  They provide, in relevant part, that each \nfacility must (1) “provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to \nmeet the nursing needs of its residents”; and (2) “use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  42 U.S.C. \n§1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n41.  For Medicaid participants, the State in which they operate may waive \nboth the requirement that a given facility “provide 24-hour licensed nursing services \nwhich are sufficient to meet the needs of its residents” and the requirement to use \nthe services of an RN for at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 days a week, if: \n(I) the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that the \nfacility has been unable, despite diligent efforts (including offering \nwages at the community prevailing rate for nursing facilities), to recruit \nappropriate personnel, \n \n(II) the State determines that a waiver of the requirement will not \nendanger the health or safety of individuals staying in the facility, \n \n19 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 21 of 57   PageID 199\n \n(III) the State finds that, for any such periods in which licensed nursing \nservices are not available, a registered professional nurse or a physician \nis obligated to respond immediately to telephone calls from the facility, \n \n(IV) the State agency granting a waiver of such requirements provides \nnotice  of  the  waiver  to  the  State  long-term  care  ombudsman \n(established under section 307(a)(12) of the Older Americans Act of \n1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the \nmentally ill and the mentally retarded, and \n \n(V) the nursing facility that is granted such a waiver by a State notifies \nresidents of the facility (or, where appropriate, the guardians or legal \nrepresentatives  of  such  residents)  and  members  of  their  immediate \nfamilies of the waiver. \n \nId. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(ii).  Further, “[i]f the Secretary determines that a State has \nshown a clear pattern and practice of allowing waivers in the absence of diligent \nefforts by facilities to meet the staffing requirements, the Secretary shall assume and \nexercise the authority of the State to grant waivers.”  42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(iii). \n42.  For Medicare participants (i.e., SNFs), the Secretary may waive the \nrequirement to use the services of an RN for at least 8 consecutive hours per day, 7 \ndays a week, if the Secretary finds that: \n(I) the facility is located in a rural area and the supply of skilled nursing \nfacility services in such area is not sufficient to meet the needs of \nindividuals residing therein, \n \n(II) the facility has one full-time registered professional nurse who is \nregularly on duty at such facility 40 hours a week, \n \n(III)  the  facility  either  has  only  patients  whose  physicians  have \nindicated (through physicians’ orders or admission notes) that each such \npatient does not require the services of a registered nurse or a physician \nfor  a  48-hour  period,  or  has  made  arrangements  for  a  registered \n20 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 22 of 57   PageID 200\n \nprofessional nurse or a physician to spend such time at such facility as \nmay be indicated as necessary by the physician to provide necessary \nskilled nursing services on days when the regular full-time registered \nprofessional nurse is not on duty, \n \n(IV) the Secretary provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term \ncare ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12) of the Older \nAmericans Act of 1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the \nState for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and \n \n(V) the facility that is granted such a waiver notifies residents of the \nfacility (or, where appropriate, the guardians or legal representatives of \nsuch residents) and members of their immediate families of the waiver. \n \nId. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(ii). \n43.  Shortly  after  Congress  enacted  these  statutory  standards  (through \nOBRA ’87 and OBRA ’90), HHS promulgated consolidated Medicare and Medicaid \nregulations that respect Congress’ judgment by essentially parroting the statutory \ntext.  See 56 Fed. Reg. 48826, 48874 (Sept. 26, 1991); see also 54 Fed. Reg. 5316 \n(Feb. 2, 1989).   \n44.  For  more  than  30  years,  CMS  faithfully  administered  the  staffing \nstandards  established  by  Congress.    See  42  C.F.R.  §483.35(a)-(b)  (2016).   As \nrecently as 2016, CMS expressly rejected “many comment[s]” urging it to deviate \nfrom the statutory standards by “establish[ing] and requir[ing] minimum staffing \nlevels and requir[ing] a registered nurse to be in the LTC facility 24 hours a day, 7 \ndays a week.”  81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68754 (Oct. 4, 2016).  While CMS claimed \n(without explanation) that it had the statutory authority to impose new standards and \n21 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 23 of 57   PageID 201\n \nsuggested that it might do so through future rulemaking, it reiterated its longstanding \nview that “a ‘one size fits all’ approach” to nursing home staffing is inappropriate.  \nId. at 68755.   \n45.  In that 2016 rulemaking, CMS emphasized its ongoing “concerns about \n[imposing] mandatory ratios” or requiring “a 24/7 RN presence,” id. at 68756; see \nid. at 68754-56, 68758.  For example, CMS felt it was unable to “determin[e] a \n‘right’ number for any staffing ratio,” id. at 68576, because “LTC facilities are varied \nin their structure and in their resident populations,” id. at 68758; see also 80 Fed. \nReg. 42168, 42201 (July 16, 2015) (emphasizing the importance of “taking acuity \nlevels into account”).  CMS instead opined that the “focus” of its regulations “should \nbe on the skill sets and specific competencies of assigned staff to provide the nursing \ncare a resident needs rather than a static number of staff or hours of nursing care.”  \n80 Fed. Reg. at 42201; accord id. at 42200 (“A focus on numbers of nurses fails to \naddress the influence of other staffing factors (for example, turnover and agency \nstaff use), training and experience of staff, and care organization and management.”).   \n46.  CMS also cautioned “that establishing a specific number of staff or \nhours of nursing care could result in staffing to that number rather than to the needs \nof the resident population.”  Id. at 42201.  Finally, CMS expressed concern that \nrequiring 24/7 RN presence in every LTC facility “could negatively impact the \ndevelopment of innovative care options, particular[ly] in smaller, more home-like \n22 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 24 of 57   PageID 202\n \nsettings,” and that “geographic disparity in supply could make such a mandate \nparticularly challenging in some rural and underserved areas.”  81 Fed. Reg. at \n68755.   \nD.  The Final Rule \n47.  Things  changed  dramatically  in  February  2022,  when  the  Biden \nAdministration  announced  its  intention  to  “establish  a  minimum  nursing  home \nstaffing  requirement.”    White  House,  FACT  SHEET:  Protecting  Seniors  by \nImproving Safety and Quality of Care in the Nation’s Nursing Homes (Feb. 28, \n2022), https://archive.ph/wip/xOXxa (capitalization altered).  The Administration \ntasked CMS with (1) “conduct[ing] a new research study to determine the level and \ntype of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care”; and (2) “issu[ing] proposed \nrules” by February 2023 setting forth “minimum standards for staffing adequacy that \nnursing homes must meet.”  Id.  Shortly thereafter, CMS commissioned a private \nfirm, Abt Associates, to perform the staffing study. \n48.  The staffing study was not published until June 2023, several months \nafter the Administration’s self-imposed deadline for issuing a proposed minimum-\nstaffing rule.6  And when the study finally was released, it did not support the \nAdministration’s desired conclusion.  For example, one of its “key findings” was \n \n6 See generally Abt Associates, Nursing Home Staffing Study: Comprehensive \nReport (June 2023) (“Abt Study”), https://www.cms.gov/files/document/nursing-\nhome-staffing-study-final-report-appendix-june-2023.pdf. \n23 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 25 of 57   PageID 203\n \nthat  while  recent  literature  indicates  that  higher  staffing  levels  are  generally \ncorrelated with better outcomes, “it does not provide a clear evidence basis for \nsetting a minimum staffing level.”  Abt Study at xi.  The study also concluded that \nthere is “no obvious plateau at which quality and safety are maximized or ‘cliff’ \nbelow which quality and safety steeply decline.”  Id. \n49.  The study noted that many stakeholders, from nursing home owners \nand operators to nursing staff interviewees, “emphasized that workforce shortages \nand current hiring challenges could present barriers to nursing home compliance \nwith a new federal staffing requirement.”  Id. at xxi; see also, e.g., id. at xii, xiv, 19, \n31-32.  But the report ultimately dodged the crucial question of whether it would be \nfeasible to implement a nationwide minimum staffing requirement—despite the \nnational workforce shortage, uneven workforce distribution, and limited access to \ntraining and education programs—on the ground that it “was not a workforce study.”  \nId. at xxi.   \n50.  The study also cited a wealth of evidence and feedback confirming that \nit makes no sense to mandate staff-to-patient ratios without accounting for variations \nin resident acuity.  See, e.g., id. at 2 (“Nursing homes with higher-acuity or more \nclinically complex residents can require a higher level of staffing to meet resident \nneeds.”); id. at 17 (“Existing literature confirms the importance of resident acuity in \ndetermining staffing needs.”); id. at 26 (“Direct care respondents (RNs, LPNs, nurse \n24 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 26 of 57   PageID 204\n \naides) consistently noted that resident acuity was more important than the actual \nnumber  of  assigned  residents  in  determining  whether  their  assignments  were \nreasonable.”).  That should have come as no surprise to CMS, as the agency and its \npredecessors repeatedly embraced that very reasoning in rejecting calls to impose \nstaff-to-patient ratios from the early 1970s through 2016.  See, e.g., 39 Fed. Reg. at \n2239 (explaining that “variation” in “patient needs and the services necessary to \nmeet those needs precludes setting” “a specific ratio of nursing staff to patients”); \n80 Fed. Reg. at 42201 (emphasizing the importance of “taking acuity levels into \naccount”).   \n51.  None  of  that  deterred  CMS  from  forging  ahead  with  the \nAdministration’s predetermined plan.  On September 6, 2023, CMS published a \nproposed rule announcing new minimum staffing standards for LTC facilities.  See \n88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (Sept. 6, 2023).  In response, AHCA, THCA, LeadingAge, and \na host of other stakeholders submitted detailed comments urging CMS not to adopt \nits proposed standards.  Stakeholders opposed to the proposed rule included: \n  the  Medicare  Payment  Advisory  Commission  (“MedPAC”),  a \nnonpartisan  independent  legislative  branch  agency  that  provides \nCongress with analysis and policy advice on the Medicare program; \n \n  the American Hospital Association, which represents and serves nearly \n5,000  hospitals  and  health  care  systems  and  43,000  individual \nmembers;  \n \n  the  National  Rural  Health  Association,  a  national  nonprofit \norganization with thousands of members across the United States;  \n25 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 27 of 57   PageID 205\n \n \n  the Catholic Health Association of the United States, which is made up \nof more than 600 Catholic hospitals and 1,600 long-term care and other \nhealth facilities in all 50 states;  \n \n  Lutheran Services in America, a network of about 300 Lutheran health \nand human services nonprofit organizations serving 1,400 communities \nacross the country;  \n \n  the Association of Jewish Aging Services, a nonprofit that promotes and \nsupports elder services in the context of Jewish values; and  \n \n  the National Association of State Veterans Homes, which works to \npromote and enhance the quality of care that veterans receive.   \n \n52.  These and other commenters repeatedly explained that the proposed \nstandards exceeded CMS’s statutory authority, contravened Congress’ considered \ndecision to impose qualitative rather than quantitative staffing standards, failed to \naccount for the widely varying circumstances and needs of the thousands of LTC \nfacilities across the country, and threatened to force nursing homes to close their \ndoors and deprive residents of much-needed care.   \n53.  CMS nevertheless pressed forward.  On May 10, 2024, the agency \npublished the Final Rule in the Federal Register.  See Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms;  Minimum  Staffing  Standards  for  Long-Term  Care  Facilities  and \nMedicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting, 89 Fed. Reg. 40876.  The \nFinal  Rule  imposes  two  mandatory  minimum-staffing  requirements  on  LTC \nfacilities, the second of which includes three mandatory sub-parts. \n26 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 28 of 57   PageID 206\n \n54.  24/7  RN  Requirement.  First, the Final Rule replaces the statutory \nrequirement that LTC facilities “use the services of [an RN] for at least 8 consecutive \nhours a day, 7 days a week,” 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i), with a new requirement to “have a registered nurse (RN) onsite 24 \nhours per day, for 7 days a week that is available to provide direct resident care,” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40997.  In other words, it triples the required hours per day of RN \nservices. \n55.  HPRD  Requirements.    Second,  the  Final  Rule  departs  from  the \nqualitative  statutory  requirement  that  LTC  facilities  “provide  24-hour  licensed \nnursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents,” 42 \nU.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i), by instead imposing \nthree rigid quantitative requirements: \n  “The facility must meet or exceed a minimum of 3.48 hours per resident \nday for total nurse staffing,” which must include— \n  “[a] minimum of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses”; and \n  “[a] minimum of 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides.” \n89 Fed. Reg. at 40996. \n56.  The  Final  Rule  also  extends  the  statutory  waiver  for  Medicaid \nparticipants (see supra ¶41) to the new 24/7 RN requirement and the 0.55 RN HPRD \nrequirement, but not the 3.48 total nurse HPRD or 2.45 NA HPRD requirements.  89 \n27 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 29 of 57   PageID 207\n \nFed. Reg. at 40997-98.  The Final Rule likewise extends the statutory waiver for \nMedicare participants (see supra ¶42) to the new 24/7 RN requirement, but not the \nHPRD requirements.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40997-98.  Neither of these statutory waivers \nwill provide any widespread relief from the Final Rule’s rigid requirements.  In fact, \ndespite the long-running, nationwide shortage of nursing staff, less than 0.2% of \nAHCA’s member facilities have been able to obtain those waivers to date as to the \nexisting statutory requirements.  See also LeadingAge Cmt.5. \n57.  The Final Rule also creates a new, regulatory “hardship exemption” that \ncan be used to obtain a partial exemption from the new 24/7 RN requirement and an \nexemption from one or more of the HPRD requirements.  See id. at 40998.  To \nqualify for a “hardship exemption,” the facility must establish that it meets four \ncriteria: \n(1) “The facility is located in an area where the supply of applicable \nhealthcare staff (RN, nurse aide (NA), or total nurse staffing ...) is not \nsufficient to meet area needs as evidenced by a provider to population \nratio for nursing workforce that is a minimum of 20 percent below the \nnational average, as calculated by CMS”; \n \n(2) “The facility demonstrates that it has been unable, despite diligent \nefforts, including offering at least prevailing wages, to recruit and retain \nappropriate personnel”; \n \n(3) “The facility demonstrates through documentation the amount of \nfinancial resources that the facility expends on nurse staffing relative to \nrevenue”; and \n \n(4) “The facility: (i) Posts, in a prominent location in the facility, and in \na form and manner accessible and understandable to residents, and \n28 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 30 of 57   PageID 208\n \nresident representatives, a notice of the facility’s exemption status, the \nextent  to  which  the  facility  does  not  meet  the  minimum  staffing \nrequirements, and the timeframe during which the exemption applies; \nand (ii) Provides to each resident or resident representative, and to each \nprospective resident or resident representative, a notice of the facility’s \nexemption status, including the extent to which the facility does not \nmeet  the  staffing  requirements,  the  timeframe  during  which  the \nexemption applies, and a statement reminding residents of their rights \nto contact advocacy and oversight entities ... ; and (iii) Sends a copy of \nthe notice to a representative of the Office of the State Long-Term Care \nOmbudsman. \n \nId. at 40998.  Notably, the criteria that CMS chose to govern its newly-invented \n“hardship exemption” differ substantially from the statutory criteria that Congress \nhas set for the statutory waiver scheme.  See supra ¶¶41-42. \n58.  The  agency’s  new  “hardship  exemption”  fails  to  provide  regulated \nfacilities with meaningful relief, as the Final Rule emphasizes that this exemption \n(like  the  existing  statutory  waivers)  will  be  “available  only  in  limited \ncircumstances.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40877; accord id. at 40894.  Even if it obtained, \nmoreover, the “hardship exemption” for the new 24/7 RN requirement is only a \npartial one, as it provides only “an exemption of 8 hours a day”; in other words, a \nfacility that obtains such an exemption must still have an RN “onsite” and “available \nto provide direct resident care” for at least 16 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Id. at \n40997-98.  In addition, any facility that receives a hardship exemption from the 24/7 \nRN  requirement  “must  have  a  registered  nurse,  nurse  practitioner,  physician \n29 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 31 of 57   PageID 209\n \nassistant, or physician available to respond immediately to telephone calls from the \nfacility” whenever there is no RN onsite.  Id. at 40997. \n59.  A facility may not obtain any “hardship exemption” if it has been \ndesignated a “Special Focus Facility,” which indicates that CMS has “identified [it] \nas having substantially failed to meet” applicable requirements of Medicare or \nMedicaid, see 42 U.S.C. §§1395i-3(f)(8), 1396r(f)(10); has received a citation from \nCMS within the past 12 months related to staffing-related issues; or has “failed to \nsubmit Payroll Based Journal data in accordance with [42 C.F.R.] § 483.70(p).”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40998. \n60.  The Final Rule’s policies are to be phased in over the next several years.  \nId. at 40913.  Facilities in non-rural areas must implement the 24/7 RN and the 3.48 \ntotal nurse HPRD requirements within 2 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 NA HPRD \nrequirements within 3 years.  Id.  Rural facilities must implement the 24/7 RN and \nthe 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirements within 3 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 \nNA HPRD requirements within 5 years.  Id.   \nE.  Harms to Plaintiffs and the Communities They Serve \n61.  CMS estimates that the Final Rule will cost LTC facilities more than $5 \nbillion per year (in 2021 dollars) after the phase-in period.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40970, \ntbl.22; see id. at 40949.  Separate analyses by LeadingAge and CliftonLarsonAllen \npredict that the costs will be even higher—around $7 billion per year.  See id. at \n30 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 32 of 57   PageID 210\n \n40950; LeadingAge Cmt.1.  Even under CMS’s unduly low estimate, LTC facilities \nare in no position to cope with this massive, unfunded mandate.  As AHCA explained \nin its comments on the proposed rule, “nearly 60 percent of [LTC] facilities have \nnegative operating margins.”  AHCA Cmt.5.  Moreover, as LeadingAge observed, \n“Medicaid is the primary payer of long-term care and average Medicaid rates cover \napproximately only 84% of the cost of care.”  LeadingAge Cmt.1.  For AHCA and \nLeadingAge members that are already struggling to stay afloat, the Final Rule \nimposes additional costs that could force them to close their doors for good.   \n62.  Compounding the problem, CMS estimates that more than 79% of LTC \nfacilities in the United States—nearly four-fifths of all facilities—will have to find \nadditional staff in order to comply with the new minimum-staffing requirements, \nwhich “exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40877.  On the national level, CMS projects that the Final Rule will \nrequire facilities to hire an additional 15,906 additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN \nrequirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement (a staffing increase of about 11.8%), \nplus an additional 77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement and 3.48 \ntotal nurse HPRD requirement (a staffing increase of about 17.2%).  See id. at 40958, \n40977-80.  These staffing increases will be practically impossible to attain, as LTC \nfacilities are already experiencing major challenges in finding and retaining qualified \nnursing staff even without the Final Rule’s massive artificial increase in demand.  \n31 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 33 of 57   PageID 211\n \nSee, e.g., LeadingAge Cmt.1.  Many of AHCA’s and LeadingAge’s member facilities \nhave vacant nursing positions that have been sitting open for months due to a dearth \nof qualified candidates.  AHCA Cmt.5; see LeadingAge Cmt. 1, 3-5 (similar).  The \nlong-term care workforce remains about 125,000 workers below its pre-pandemic \nlevels; hundreds of thousands of nurses are expected to retire or leave the profession \nin the coming years; and a shortage of nursing school faculty has contributed to a \ndecrease in nursing program enrollment for the first time in more than two decades.  \nSee AHCA Cmt.5; LeadingAge Cmt.1. \n63.  The  Final  Rule’s  adverse  effects  will  be  especially  pronounced  in \nTexas.  According to CMS, “Texas will need to hire the most [additional] RNs” of \nany state to meet the new staffing standards—approximately 653 RNs to comply \nwith the 24/7 RN requirement, plus another 1,926 RNs to comply with the 0.55 RN \nHPRD requirement.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40,957, 40,976-80.  That is a 46.1% increase in \nthe number of RNs employed by LTC facilities in Texas.  See id.  Texas will require \napproximately 7,887 additional NAs to meet the other HPRD requirements, which \nrepresents an increase of 28.4%.  See id. at 40,978. 40,980.  As THCA explained in \nits  comments,  Texas  simply  does  not  have  the  manpower  to  implement  these \nrequirements, as it “is already short of thousands of RNs and []NAs.”  THCA \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  1  (Nov.  6,  2023), \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-43368  (“THCA  Cmt.”).  \n32 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 34 of 57   PageID 212\n \nAnd while LTC facilities in Texas employ nearly 60,000 LVNs—the second largest \nnumber of any State—the Final Rule does not allow hours worked by LPNs/LVNs \nto be counted toward the NA HPRD requirement, even though LPNs/LVNs complete \nmore education and training than NAs.  Cf. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40897 (noting that either \nRNs or LPNs/LVNs—but not NAs—can be used to meet the statutory requirement \nof 24-hour licensed nursing services).  As LeadingAge warned in its comments, \nwithout the opportunity for substitution of LPNs with respect to RN or nurse aide \nrequirements, the Final Rule “marginalizes the contributions of LPNs in the long-\nterm care [sector],” which “employs more LPNs than any other sector.”  LeadingAge \nCmt.2. \n64.  CMS acknowledges that Texas facilities alone will collectively need to \nspend nearly half a billion dollars per year to comply with these new requirements—\n$84 million on the 24/7 RN requirement, and another $409 million on the three \nHPRD requirements.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40958, 40960, 40983.  THCA members \nare simply unable to absorb these additional costs on top of the rising costs of care, \nchronic underfunding of Medicaid, and ongoing inflationary factors.  THCA Cmt.3. \n65.  To make matters worse, CMS is imposing these massive burdens on \nthousands of LTC facilities that already provide high-quality care for their residents, \nand already comply with any state-law minimum staffing standards that their state \ngovernments have set in light of local conditions.  LTC facilities use a variety of \n33 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 35 of 57   PageID 213\n \nstaffing blends to meet the unique needs of their resident populations, and many \nachieve above-average ratings on health inspections and quality measures even \nthough they do not satisfy CMS’s arbitrary new staffing requirements.  The named \nplaintiffs illustrate the point: \n  Plaintiff Arbrook Plaza has a 5-star overall rating from CMS, including \nquality measures that are “much above average” and health inspections \nthat are “above average.”  It delivers these results with an average of \n0.18 RN HPRD, 1.17 LVN HPRD, and 2.25 NA HPRD.  Even though \nArbrook Plaza receives high marks across the board in terms of resident \ncare, and already complies with the minimum-staffing standards set by \nTexas  law,  the  Final  Rule  will  force  it  to  begin  offering  24/7  RN \nservices, triple its RN HPRD, and significantly increase its NA HPRD.  \n \n  Plaintiff Booker Hospital District operates Twin Oaks, which has a 5-\nstar overall rating from CMS.  By CMS’s own account, Twin Oaks’ \nstaffing is “much above average” and its health inspections are “above \naverage.”  Twin Oaks is the only one of the named plaintiffs that is \ncurrently in compliance with CMS’s new HPRD requirements, and \nTwin  Oaks  is  also  in  full  compliance  with  the  minimum  staffing \nstandards set by Texas law.  Nevertheless, the Final Rule will require \nTwin Oaks to recruit and hire additional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN \nrequirement—an extremely daunting task for a 61-bed facility located \nin one of the most rural parts of the Texas panhandle. \n \n  Plaintiff Harbor Lakes has a 5-star overall rating from CMS, including \nquality measures that are “much above average” and health inspections \nthat are “above average.”  It also meets the minimum-staffing standards \nestablished by Texas law.  Harbor Lakes is able to provide high-quality \ncare thanks to a staffing mix that includes 1.1 HPRD of LVN services, \nwhich  is  well  above  the  national  average.    But  the  Final  Rule \nirrationally discounts (and largely ignores) the contributions of LVNs, \nand will therefore force Harbor Lakes to significantly increase its RN \nand NA staffing.  Despite its high quality ratings, the facility does not \ncurrently  meet  the  24/7  RN  requirement,  the  0.55  RN  HPRD \nrequirement, or the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement. \n \n34 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 36 of 57   PageID 214\n \n66.  In sum, the Final Rule will impose a significant regulatory burden on \neach of these facilities, as well as thousands of other LTC facilities represented by \nAHCA,  LeadingAge,  and  THCA.    That  easily  suffices  to  establish Article  III \nstanding.  See, e.g., Duarte ex rel. Duarte v. City of Lewisville, 759 F.3d 514, 518 \n(5th Cir. 2014) (“[I]f a plaintiff is an object of a government regulation, then that \nplaintiff ordinarily has standing to challenge that regulation.”).   \n67.  The harms imposed by the Final Rule extend even further.  More than \n500 nursing homes closed over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and very few \nof them have reopened or been replaced by new facilities.  AHCA Cmt.5; see also \nTHCA Cmt.3 (noting that “[s]ince March 2020, 56 skilled nursing facilities have \nclosed” in Texas alone).  By imposing a massive, unfunded staffing mandate at a \ntime when there is already an inadequate supply of RNs and NAs, the Final Rule \nwill force scores of additional nursing homes to reduce their capacity or even shut \ndown entirely.  AHCA Cmt.7-8, 10; THCA Cmt.4; LeadingAge Cmt.1.  This would \nhave a hugely detrimental effect on access to long-term care.  In fact, according to \nCliftonLarsonAllen’s analysis, the Final Rule could cause nearly one quarter of \nnursing home residents to be displaced from their current nursing home, while \nforcing countless other seniors and family members to wait longer, search farther, \nand pay more for the care they need.  AHCA Cmt.7; see also LeadingAge Cmt.1-2. \n35 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 37 of 57   PageID 215\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT ONE \n(APA – Lack of Statutory Authority) \n68.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n69.  Like all administrative agencies, CMS is a “creature[] of statute,” and \naccordingly “possess[es] only the authority that Congress has provided.” Nat’l Fed’n \nof Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022); see also, e.g., La. Pub. \nServ. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986) (“[A]n agency literally has no \npower to act … unless and until Congress confers power upon it.”).  That well-\nestablished principle dooms the Final Rule, as Congress has not authorized CMS to \nimpose the 24/7 RN requirement or the HPRD requirements. \nA.  The 24/7 RN Requirement \n70.  Congress has specified the minimum amount of RN staffing necessary \nto participate in Medicaid or Medicare:  All LTC facilities “must use the services of \na registered professional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.”  \n42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i).   \n71.  The Final Rule impermissibly alters this statutory requirement in two \ndistinct ways.  First, it triples the hours of mandatory RN staffing, replacing the 8/7 \nRN requirement enacted by Congress with a mandate that all LTC facilities “must \nhave a registered nurse (RN) onsite 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week.”  89 Fed. \n36 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 38 of 57   PageID 216\n \nReg. at 40997.  Second, the Final Rule replaces the statutory requirement to “use the \nservices of” an RN, including in administrative or supervisory roles, with a new \nrequirement to have an RN “available to provide direct resident care.”  Id. \n72.  CMS  concedes  that  the  statutory  provisions  setting  forth  the  8/7 \nrequirement for RN staffing do not empower it to adopt the 24/7 RN requirement.  \nSee  89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40891  (disclaiming  reliance  on  §§1395i-3(b)(4)(C)  and \n1396r(b)(4)(C) as source of statutory authority).  It could hardly be otherwise, as \neven in the heyday of “Chevron deference,” a statutory requirement of X was not an \ninvitation  for  the  agency  to  require  3X.    The  agency  nevertheless  asserts  that \n“various provisions” elsewhere in §§1395i-3 and 1396r contain “separate authority” \nfor this novel requirement, id. at 40879, 40890-91, pointing to provisions stating \nthat: \n  The Secretary may impose “such other requirements relating to the \nhealth and safety of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof \nas the Secretary may find necessary.”  42 U.S.C. §1396r(d)(4)(B); accord \n42 U.S.C. §1395i-3(d)(4)(B).  \n  An  LTC  facility  “must  provide  services  and  activities  to  attain  or \nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-\nbeing of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care.”  42 \nU.S.C. §1396r(b)(2); accord 42 U.S.C. §1395i-3(b)(2). \n  An LTC facility “must care for its residents in such a manner and in such \nan environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the \nquality of life of each resident.” 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(1)(A); accord 42 \nU.S.C. §1395i-3(b)(1)(A). \n37 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 39 of 57   PageID 217\n \n73.  None of these more general provisions supplies authority for replacing \nthe statutory 8/7 RN requirement with a regulatory 24/7 RN requirement.  It is well \nestablished that “[g]eneral language” in one part of a statute “will not be held to \napply to a matter specifically dealt with in another part of the same enactment.”  E.g., \nRadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645-46 (2012) \n(quoting D. Ginsberg & Sons, Inc. v. Popkin, 285 U.S. 204, 208 (1932)).  Whatever \nthe scope of the Secretary’s general authority to impose “other requirements,” 42 \nU.S.C.  §§1395i-3(d)(4)(B),  1396r(d)(4)(B)  (emphasis  added),  and  flesh  out  the \n“services,” “activities,” and “care” that LTC facilities must provide, id. §§1395i-\n3(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), 1396r(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), it does not include the power to modify \nthe requirements specifically enacted by Congress.   \n74.  But that is exactly what the Final Rule does.  As CMS itself recognizes, \nthe Final Rule “revises” the statutory 8/7 RN requirement codified at 42 U.S.C. \n§§1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i), replacing it with CMS’s preferred 24/7 \nRN requirement.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40898.  That is not a decision that Congress \nleft open for CMS to make.  On the contrary, the Social Security Act itself confirms \nthat the Secretary may not “publish ... rules and regulations” that are “inconsistent \nwith” provisions of the Act.  42 U.S.C. §1302(a); see also 89 Fed. Reg. at 40897, \n40898-99 (acknowledging that detailed statutory scheme for waiving the 8/7 RN \n38 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 40 of 57   PageID 218\n \nrequirement “can only be modified by legislation”).  The 24/7 RN requirement \nplainly flunks that test and must be set aside.  See 5 U.S.C. §706(2). \nB.  The HPRD Requirements \n75.  The same goes for the Final Rule’s HPRD requirements.  Congress has \nextensively considered whether to enact staff-to-patient ratios for LTC facilities, and \nCongress  specifically  chose  not  to  do  so.    Instead  of  a  rigid  one-size-fits-all \nquantitative requirement, Congress opted for a flexible qualitative standard:  An LTC \nfacility must provide nursing services “sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its \nresidents.”  42 U.S.C. 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord §1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n76.  The Final Rule impermissibly substitutes CMS’s current policy views \nfor Congress’ considered judgment and replaces a flexible standard with a rule of \nalmost comical rigidity and specificity.  By requiring “[a] minimum of 3.48 hours \nper  resident  day  for  total  nurse  staffing[,]  including  but  not  limited  to—(i) [a] \nminimum of 0.55 hours per resident day for registered nurses; and (ii) [a] minimum \nof 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse aides,” it replaces the flexible standard that \nCongress consciously chose—which accommodates the wide variation in resident \nneeds across different facilities—with an inflexible mandate that each facility meet \nan arbitrary numerical staffing threshold.  89 Fed. Reg. at 40996.  Moreover, the \nrequirement to have RN staffing of at least 0.55 HPRD is inconsistent with the \nstatutory requirement to have RN staffing for at least 8 consecutive hours per day—\n39 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 41 of 57   PageID 219\n \nas illustrated by CMS’s felt need to extend the statutory waiver that applies to the \n8/7 RN requirement to not only the new 24/7 RN requirement but also the 0.55 RN \nHPRD requirement.  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997.   \n77.  Once again, these are not choices Congress has authorized CMS to \nmake.  CMS does not rely on §1395i-3(b)(4)(C) or §1396r(b)(4)(C) as authority for \nthese new requirements.  It instead once again invokes the Secretary’s general \nauthority to impose “necessary” requirements relating to residents’ health and safety, \nas well as provisions requiring LTC facilities to “provide services to attain or \nmaintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of \neach resident,” and “promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of \neach resident.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40879, 40890-91; see 42 U.S.C. §§1395i-3(b)(1)(A), \n(b)(2), (d)(4)(B); 1396r(b)(1)(A), (b)(2), (d)(4)(B).  But none of those provisions \nempowers CMS to impose rigid HPRD requirements for RNs, NAs, and total nursing \nstaff.  As explained, CMS’s general authority over Medicare and Medicaid does not \npermit it to modify “matter[s] specifically dealt with in another part of the same \nenactment.”  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, 566 U.S. at 646; see also 42 U.S.C. §1302(a) \n(Secretary may not promulgate regulations that are “inconsistent with” statutory \nrequirements).  Congress squarely considered the question of what staffing levels to \nrequire from LTC facilities and the relative merits of a flexible standard and rigid \nrules,  and  it  chose  to  require  only  that  each  facility  maintain  staffing  levels \n40 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 42 of 57   PageID 220\n \n“sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents.”  42 U.S.C. §§1396r(b)(4)(C), \n1395i-3(b)(4)(C).  That leaves no room for CMS to supersede Congress’ judgment \nwith its own arbitrary numerical requirements.  And the Secretary’s assertion that \none-size-fits all HPRD levels “are necessary for resident health, safety, and well-\nbeing,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40890, is flatly at odds with Congress’ determination that \nsufficient staffing levels should be determined by reference to the particularized \nneeds of each facility, based on its unique mix of residents with varying needs and \nlevels of acuity.   \n78.  Notably, the Final Rule makes clear that it will no longer be enough for \nan LTC facility to meet the statutory requirement to “provide 24-hour licensed \nnursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents” by \nusing any suitable combination of RNs, NAs, LPNs/LVNs, and other caregivers and \nsupport staff, 42 U.S.C. §1396r(b)(4)(C), as Congress chose to require by statute and \nas Arbrook Plaza, Twin Oaks, and Harbor Lakes currently do.  Instead, all LTC \nfacilities  will  now  be  required  comply  with  new,  one-size-fits-all  HPRD \nrequirements, even if “the facility assessment indicates that a lower HPRD [is \nsufficient] or that a 24/7 RN is not required to care for their resident population.”  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40908.  CMS simply does not have the authority to override Congress’ \njudgment in this manner. \n41 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 43 of 57   PageID 221\n \nC.  Major Questions Doctrine \n79.  The  history  of  Congress’  actions  in  this  area,  the  “breadth  of  the \nauthority” CMS now asserts, and “the economic and political significance” of that \nasserted authority further confirm that CMS does not have the power to impose these \nnew staffing mandates.  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022).   \n80.  By promulgating the Final Rule, CMS “adopt[ed] a regulatory program \nthat Congress ha[s] conspicuously and repeatedly declined to enact itself.”  Id. at \n724.  For more than half a century, Congress—not CMS or its predecessors—has \ntaken the lead in setting staffing requirements for nursing homes that participate in \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs.  See supra ¶¶30-39.  And on the rare occasions \nwhen CMS has tried to take a more aggressive approach, Congress has stepped in to \ncurtail its efforts.  Most notably, Congress has twice acted to block major regulatory \nchanges affecting LTC facilities—first in 1980, when it prohibited HHS from using \nappropriated funds to publish final regulations, Pub. L. No. 96-536, §119, 94 Stat. \n3166; see supra ¶¶33-34, and again in 1987, when it terminated a rulemaking that \nproposed new staffing standards by extensively amending the statute, Pub. L. No. \n100-203,  101  Stat.  1330;  see  supra  ¶¶36-38.    A  few  years  later,  Congress \nunderscored its intent to govern nursing home staffing through legislation—not \nagency regulation—by specifically instructing HHS to study potential minimum-\nstaffing requirements for nursing homes and provide a report with recommendations \n42 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 44 of 57   PageID 222\n \nfor Congress to consider.  See supra ¶39.  Congress has not altered the statutory \nstaffing  requirements  for  LTC  facilities  since  1990,  and  the  relevant  agency \nregulations have mirrored those statutory standards for well over 3 decades.  See \nsupra ¶¶40-46.  All of that history belies any assertion that Congress intended to \ndelegate the issue to CMS. \n81.  The economic and political significance of these minimum-staffing \nrules likewise undermines CMS’s claim of regulatory authority.  By CMS’s own \nestimate, the Final Rule would require more than 79% of LTC facilities—nearly four \nout of every five facilities in the country—to increase their staffing levels.  89 Fed. \nReg.  at  40877.   All  told,  facilities  would  need  to  hire  approximately  15,906 \nadditional RNs (a staffing increase of about 11.8%) and 77,611 additional NAs (a \nstaffing increase of about 17.2%).  See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40958, tbl.16; id. at 40977-\n80, tbls.25 & 26.  After the initial phase-in period, the Final Rule would cost over $5 \nbillion per year (in CY 2021 dollars)—nearly all of which would be borne by LTC \nfacilities.  Id. at 40970, tbl.22; see id. at 40949.  \n82.  These  massive  burdens  could  force  many  facilities  to  limit  their \ncapacity or close entirely, threatening to displace tens if not hundreds of thousands \nof nursing home residents.  See AHCA, Report: Increasing Nursing Home Staffing \nMinimums  Estimated  at  $10  Billion  Annually  (July  19,  2022), \nhttps://archive.ph/wip/dTA9Q  (estimating  that  a  minimum  staffing  level  of  4.1 \n43 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 45 of 57   PageID 223\n \nHPRD would threaten to displace as many as 205,000 nursing home residents); cf. \n89 Fed. Reg. at 40953 (recognizing risk of “closure of facilities due to inadequate \nstaff availability”).  Given these huge social and economic impacts, and the absence \nof “clear congressional authorization,” “there is every reason to ‘hesitate before \nconcluding that Congress meant to confer on [CMS] the authority it claims.”  West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 725. \nCOUNT TWO \n(APA – Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action) \n83.  Plaintiffs  re-allege  and  incorporate  by  reference  the  preceding \nallegations as though fully set forth herein. \n84.  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires  that  agency \naction be “reasonable and reasonably explained.”  E.g., Texas v. United States, 40 \nF.4th 205, 226 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. \n414, 423 (2021)).  This standard “is not toothless”; to the contrary, “it has serious \nbite.”  Id.  The court “must set aside any action premised on reasoning that fails to \naccount for relevant factors or evinces a clear error of judgment.”  Id.  The court \nmust also set aside agency action when the agency “fail[ed] to respond to significant \npoints ... raised by the public comments.”  Huawei Techs. USA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th \n421, 449 (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Carlson v. Postal Regul. Comm’n, 938 F.3d 337, \n344 (D.C. Cir. 2019)).  And when, as here, an agency changes a longstanding policy, \nit must “show that there are good reasons for the new policy” and “be cognizant that \n44 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 46 of 57   PageID 224\n \nlongstanding policies may have ‘engendered serious reliance interests that must be \ntaken into account.’”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221-22 \n(2016) (quoting FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009)).  \nCMS’s adoption of the Final Rule violated these settled requirements several times \nover.  \nA.  One-Size-Fits-All Standards \n85.  Over the past 50 years, CMS and its predecessors have consistently \nrejected calls to deviate from the plain text of the Social Security Act by requiring \nnursing homes to provide “a specific ratio of nursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. \nat 2239.  In 1974, the Social Security Administration explained that “the variation \nfrom facility to facility in the composition of its nursing staff, physical layout, patient \nneeds[,] and the services necessary to meet those needs precludes setting such a \nfigure.”  Id.  In 1980, when HHS took over the administration of Medicare and \nMedicaid, it expressly declined to propose “any nursing staff ratios or minimum \nnumber of nursing hours per patient per day.”  45 Fed. Reg. at 47371.  In 1986, an \nHHS-commissioned study concluded that “prescribing simple staffing ratios clearly \nis inappropriate,” observing that individuals within a single facility have “widely \ndiffering needs,” and some facilities have a much “larger proportion of heavy-care \nresidents” than other facilities.7  In 2002, the Secretary of HHS informed Congress \n \n7 See Inst. of Med., supra, at 102-03.   \n45 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 47 of 57   PageID 225\n \nthat  after  studying  the  issue  for  several  years,  it  was  not  recommending  the \nimposition of minimum-staffing ratios on LTC facilities.  Thompson Letter at 1.  And \nas recently as 2016, CMS again rejected requests to adopt minimum-staffing rules, \nreiterating that it is not reasonable to adopt “a ‘one size fits all’ approach” toward \nLTC  facilities  that  care  for  a  wide  range  of  resident  populations  with  greatly \ndivergent needs.  81 Fed. Reg. at 68755; see id. at 68754-56, 68758. \n86.  CMS  came  nowhere  near  providing  a  reasoned  explanation  for \ndeparting from its longstanding position that fixed numerical staffing requirements \nare inappropriate.  On the contrary, as AHCA explained in its comments on the \nproposed rule, the agency’s basic, oft-reiterated reason for rejecting prior calls to \nimpose blanket minimum-staffing ratios—that “LTC facilities are varied in their \nstructure and in their resident populations,” id. at 68758—remains equally true \ntoday.  See AHCA Cmt.6, 9-10, 13-14, 16; Abt Study at 2 (“Nursing homes with \nhigher-acuity or more clinically complex residents can require a higher level of \nstaffing to meet resident needs.”); id. at 11, 18 (similar).  Indeed, the recent Abt \nAssociates study concluded that the literature on nursing home staffing “has not \nidentified a minimum staffing level required for adequate care quality.”  Abt Study \nat 11.  That is hardly surprising.  To give just one example, LTC facilities that \nspecialize in serving especially vulnerable populations, such as individuals with \ndementia  or Alzheimer’s  disease,  naturally  require  more  staffing  than  facilities \n46 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 48 of 57   PageID 226\n \nserving individuals with far lower levels of acuity.  See id. at 11-12; see also 81 Fed. \nReg. at 68755 (explaining that such ratios “could negatively impact the development \nof innovative care options”).  In short, the Final Rule will produce unreasonable \nover- and under-staffing because there is so much variation among nursing homes. \n87.  CMS’s  decision  to  impose  a  single,  nationwide  standard  is  also \nunreasonable in view of major differences among the States.  State Medicaid rates \nfor nursing home services vary from $170 per day to over $400 per day.  AHCA \nCmt.6.  Some States have a relatively good supply of RNs and NAs, while other \nStates—such as Texas—are facing a massive shortage.  See, e.g., 89 Fed. Reg. at \n40957, 40976; 81 Fed. Reg. at 6755 (noting “geographic disparity in supply” of \nnursing staff).  Far from “highlight[ing] the need for national minimum-staffing \nstandards,” as CMS now claims, the “widespread variability in existing minimum \nstaffing standards” adopted by 38 States and the District of Columbia underscores \nthat “different local circumstances ... make different staffing levels appropriate (and \nhigher levels impracticable) in different areas of the country.”  Compare 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40880, with AHCA Cmt.6.  By imposing fixed nationwide requirements that \n“exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States,” 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40877, CMS has cast aside not only Congress’ clear command, but the \nconsidered choices of state governments whose various state-law minimum staffing \nrequirements reflect their own particular local conditions. \n47 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 49 of 57   PageID 227\n \n88.  CMS’s  attempts  to  justify  its  irrational  approach  are  woefully \ninsufficient.  CMS concedes that its 24/7 RN requirement imposes a “one-size-fits-\nall” requirement, 89 Fed. Reg. at 40908, but tries to avoid that characterization for \nits HPRD requirements on the ground that the HPRD ratio “is automatically adjusted \nfor size of facility.”  Id.  Of course, CMS itself previously described “minimum \nstaffing ratios” as “a ‘one size fits all’ approach,” 81 Fed. Reg. at 68755, and rightly \nso:  As the Final Rule makes clear, and as commenters underscored, the new HPRD \nrequirements—unlike the qualitative standard that Congress chose—do not account \nfor “the variation from facility to facility in the composition of its nursing staff, \nphysical layout, patient needs[,] and the services necessary to meet those needs.”  \nAHCA.Cmt.9 (quoting 39 Fed. Reg. at 2239); see, e.g., id. at 6, 13-14, 16, 19, 22; \naccord 81 Fed. Reg. at 68758-59 (denying requests to “utiliz[e] a minimum staffing \nstandard”  because  “LTC  facilities  are  varied  in  their  structure”  and  in  their \n“residents’ acuity and diagnoses”). \n89.  CMS asserts that the new standards do not need to “account[] for \nresident acuity” because they represent “minimum baseline standards for safety and \nquality.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40887; see id. at 40877, 40891-95.  But the 24/7 RN \nrequirement can hardly be plausibly described as a minimum-necessary “baseline” \nwhen it triples the statutory requirement that has been in place for half a century.  So \ntoo for the new HPRD requirements, which CMS itself admits “exceed the existing \n48 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 50 of 57   PageID 228\n \nminimum staffing requirements in nearly all States” that have any.  Id. at 40877; see \n88 Fed. Reg. at 61359; AHCA Cmt.8; LeadingAge Cmt.3 (similar).  And CMS \nacknowledges that “more than 79 percent of nursing facilities nationwide” cannot \nmeet the new requirements with their current staff, but its own findings belie the \nnotion that anywhere close to 79 percent of U.S. nursing homes are failing to meet \n“minimum baseline standards for safety and quality.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40887.  On \nthe  contrary,  CMS’s  own  survey  process  indicates  that  “roughly  95  percent  of \nfacilities”  are  already  “providing  ‘sufficient  nursing  staff’”  without  the  new \nrequirements.  AHCA Cmt.25.  \n90.  CMS’s explanation for abandoning its decades-old rejection of one-\nsize-fits-all  staffing  requirements  boils  down  to  this:    Some  LTC  facilities  are \nchronically understaffed, and “evidence demonstrates the benefits of increased nurse \nstaffing in these facilities.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40881; see id. at 40893-94.  But the \ngeneral (and undisputed) proposition that increased staffing in understaffed facilities \ncan  lead  to  better  outcomes  does  not  justify  mandating  a  blanket  24/7  RN \nrequirement and three rigid HPRD requirements for all LTC facilities nationwide.  \nCMS has not offered any reasonable explanation for reversing its longstanding \nposition that high degree of “variation from facility to facility ... precludes setting” \nany generally applicable “ratio of nursing staff to patients.”  39 Fed. Reg. at 2239; \naccord 81 Fed. Reg. at 6875.  That is because there is no reasonable explanation for \n49 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 51 of 57   PageID 229\n \nmandating 24/7 RN coverage and rigid HPRD ratios in all cases.  The agency’s \ndecision to impose one-size-fits-all staffing standards on LTC facilities was arbitrary \nand capricious and must be set aside.    \nB.  Unachievable Requirements \n91.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious for another reason as well:  \nAs detailed in AHCA’s, LeadingAge’s, and THCA’s comments on the proposed rule, \nit will be impossible for many LTC facilities to implement CMS’s new minimum-\nstaffing requirements because of the inadequate supply of RNs and NAs.  See AHCA \nCmt.1-2, 5, 11-13, 18; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2, 4; THCA Cmt.1-2.  As CMS itself \nacknowledges,  its  new  requirements  “exceed  the  existing  minimum  staffing \nrequirements in nearly all States” and will require increased staffing “in more than \n79  percent  of  nursing  facilities  nationwide.”    89  Fed.  Reg.  at  40877.    CMS \naccordingly estimates that LTC facilities will need to hire an additional 15,906 \nadditional RNs to meet the 24/7 RN requirement and 0.55 RN HPRD requirement \n(a staffing increase of about 11.8%), plus an additional 77,611 NAs to meet the 2.45 \nNA HPRD requirement and 3.48 total nurse HPRD requirement (a staffing increase \nof about 17.2%).  See id. at 40958, 40977-80.  In Texas alone, facilities will need to \nhire about 2,579 additional RNs (an increase of 46.1%) and 7,887 additional NAs \n(an increase of 28.4%).  Id. at 40,957, 40,976-80.  Those increases are beyond \nimpossible at a time when many LTC facilities are already experiencing extreme \n50 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 52 of 57   PageID 230\n \ndifficulty finding qualified RNs and NAs to fill vacant positions, and when staffing \nshortages are expected only to worsen.  See, e.g., AHCA Cmt.5; LeadingAge Cmt.1.  \nPut simply, “staffing mandates do not create more caregivers, nor do they drive \ncaregivers to work in long term care.”  AHCA Cmt.1.  \n92.  The Final Rule also irrationally discounts the vital role of LPNs/LVNs, \nwho hold nearly 230,000 jobs in LTC facilities across the country and undisputedly \n“provide important services to [their] residents.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40881; see AHCA \nCmt.6; LeadingAge Cmt.2.  As commenters pointed out, the Final Rule creates a \nperverse incentive for LTC facilities “to terminate LPN/LVNs and replace them with \n... [less qualified] nurse aides” in order to meet the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement.  \nCMS recognized this problem in both the proposed rule and the Final Rule, but \nbizarrely concluded that “[a] total nurse staffing standard will guard[] against” it.  89 \nFed. Reg. at 40893; see 88 Fed. Reg. at 61366, 61369.  That is obviously wrong.  For \nexample, a facility that already provides high-quality care through average staffing \nof 0.55 RN HPRD, 1.25 LVN/LPN HPRD, and 1.7 NA HPRD would satisfy the 3.48 \ntotal nurse HPRD requirement but would need an additional 0.75 NA HPRD to \nsatisfy the 2.45 NA HPRD requirement.  The Final Rule thus pressures LTC facilities \nto replace experienced LPNs/LVNs with less-qualified new hires in order to meet \nCMS’s arbitrary quota of 2.45 NA HPRD. \n51 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 53 of 57   PageID 231\n \n93.  The staggering costs of the Final Rule underscore its arbitrary and \ncapricious nature.  By CMS’s own estimate, the Final Rule will cost over $5 billion \nper year to implement once fully phased in, see 89 Fed. Reg. at 40949, 40970; other \nestimates place the costs as high as $7 billion per year, see id. at 40950.  The Final \nRule does not provide any additional funding for Medicare or Medicaid, so CMS \n“assume[s] that LTC facilities ... will bear the[se] costs.”  Id. at 40949.  As AHCA, \nLeadingAge, and THCA explained in their comments, LTC facilities are in no \nposition to take on this huge financial burden.  AHCA Cmt.5; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2; \nTHCA Cmt.3.  Nearly 60 percent of LTC facilities already have negative operating \nmargins; more than 500 LTC facilities closed over the course of the pandemic; and \nthe costs associated with these new staffing mandates would likely force many more \nfacilities to close.  AHCA Cmt.5; see LeadingAge Cmt.1-2.   \n94.  CMS’s decision to impose this massive, unfunded staffing mandate, \ndespite the ongoing workforce crisis and economic realities, is neither “reasonable” \nnor “reasonably explained.”  Cf. Texas, 40 F.4th at 226.  The Final Rule nowhere \ndenies that there presently are not nearly enough RNs and NAs available to enable \nthe 79 percent of LTC facilities that are not presently in compliance to satisfy the \nagency’s new mandates.  It instead just touts a new initiative that seeks to encourage \npeople to pursue careers in nursing by “investing over $75 million in financial \nincentives such as tuition reimbursement.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40894.  But, as AHCA and \n52 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 54 of 57   PageID 232\n \nLeadingAge have explained, this “one-time workforce effort” is “a drop in the \nbucket compared to the funding that will be needed to train [the] additional nursing \nstaff” necessary to meet the new mandates.  AHCA Cmt. 23; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2.  \nIt “is not going to fix the workforce crisis,” and it does practically nothing to offset \nthe $5 billion to $7 billion per year in costs that the Final Rule imposes on LTC \nfacilities.  AHCA Cmt.23; LeadingAge Cmt.1-2. \n95.  CMS  asserts  that  the  Final  Rule’s  phase-in  period  will  “allow  all \nfacilities  the  time  needed  to  prepare  and  comply  with  the  new  requirements \nspecifically to recruit, retain, and hire nurse staff as needed.”  89 Fed. Reg. 40894.  \nBut  delaying  the  deadline  for  compliance  does  nothing  to  fix  the  underlying \nproblems identified by AHCA, THCA, and LeadingAge.  Regardless of whether it \ngoes into effect tomorrow or two or three years from now, the Final Rule is still a \nmulti-billion-dollar unfunded mandate that many LTC facilities will have no realistic \nway to meet.  And there is no reason to think that the shortage of RNs and NAs will \nease over the next two to three years; to the contrary, it is projected to become even \nworse, as “hundreds of thousands are expected to retire or leave the health care \nprofession entirely in the coming years.”  AHCA Cmt.5; see id. at 2 (“The phase-in \nprovisions are frankly meaningless considering the growing caregiver shortage.”); \nLeadingAge Cmt.7 (similar).  CMS says that it “fully expect[s] that LTC facilities \nwill be able to meet [the Final Rule’s] requirements,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40894, but it \n53 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 55 of 57   PageID 233\n \nfails to cite any evidence to support this wishful thinking.  Moreover, the staggered \nimplementation timeframe risks “pit[ting] urban and rural areas against each other \nas staff are first recruited away from rural areas to fulfill the needs of urban nursing \nhomes,  then  1-2  years  later  rural  areas  are  scrapping  to  bring  staff  back.”  \nLeadingAge Cmt.7. \n96.  Finally, CMS’s “hardship exemption” process is a wholly inadequate \nresponse to the staffing shortage and economic constraints facing LTC facilities.  For \none thing, such exemptions are available only to facilities that have been surveyed \nand cited for failure to meet the new staffing standards—and “facilities cannot \nrequest”  (or  receive)  “a  survey  specifically  for  the  purpose  of  granting  an \nexemption.”  89 Fed. Reg. at 40902.  Thus, instead of being able to proactively \nexplain why it should be entitled to an exemption, facilities that cannot meet CMS’s \narbitrary  requirements  will  face  a  perpetual  risk  of  being  sanctioned  for  non-\ncompliance.    See  AHCA  Cmt.6,  33-34;  LeadingAge  Cmt.6  (criticizing  CMS’s \napproach as “unnecessarily punitive”).  In all events, the waivers are “no solution \nfor the ongoing nationwide shortage in nursing staff” or the lack of funds available \nto  implement  the  new  requirements.   AHCA  Cmt.7.    Indeed,  CMS  repeatedly \nemphasizes that the hardship exemption is meant for “limited circumstances,” 89 \nFed. Reg. at 40894, and that many facilities in areas of the country with severe \nshortages of available RNs and NAs would not qualify for an exemption because \n54 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00114-Z-BR   Document 26   Filed 06/18/24    Page 56 of 57   PageID 234\n \nthere are so many “other requirements” that must be met “to obtain an exemption.”  \nId. at 40953.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs pray for the following relief from the Court: \n1.

The State of Texas (“Texas”) brings this action to set aside (i.e., vacate) and enjoin \nDefendants from enforcing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Final Rule \nentitled “Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Minimum Staffing Standards for Long-Term Care \nFacilities and Medicaid Institutional Payment Transparency Reporting” (“the Final Rule”), 89 \nFed. Reg. 40876 (May 10, 2024). \n2.  The Final Rule imposes new minimum nurse staffing requirements on nursing \nhomes (also known as “long-term care facilities”) as a condition of their participation in Medicare \nand Medicaid. Because 97% of all nursing homes participate in these programs, the Final Rule will \nimpact nearly every nursing home in America. \n3.  The Final Rule’s new requirements depart sharply from both black letter law and \ndecades of precedent. Historically, Congress has required that (1) a nursing home “must use the \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 2 of 35   PageID 2\nservices of a registered professional nurse [(“RN”)] for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days \na week”; and (2) a nursing home “must provide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are \nsufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents.” Id. §1396r(b)(4)(C)(i); accord id. §1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i). \n4.  The  new  requirements  remove  the  historic  flexibility  of  a  nursing  home  to \ndetermine what is “sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its residents.” Id. Instead, the CMS \nFinal Rule now imposes a one-size-fits-all rule that directly contravenes Congress’s stated flexible \ndirective with rigid, inflexible requirements. \n5.  First, the Final Rule triples the required onsite hours of the RN from 8 to 24 hours \nper day, 7 days per week. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40898, 40997. Second, it changes the flexible ‘sufficiency’ \nstandard to a set of three quantitative requirements: (1) total nurse staffing of at least 3.48 hours \nper resident day (“HRPD”); (2) RN staffing of at least 0.55 HPRD; and (3) nurse aide (“NA”) \nstaffing of at least 2.45 HPRD. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877. These rules apply regardless of the care \nfacility’s actual staffing needs. \n6.  CMS—perhaps  recognizing  that  its  sweeping  Final  Rule  departs  from  both \nCongress’s directive and decades of precedent—claims that its power to promulgate this rule \nderives from provisions of the Medicare and Medicaid Acts that enable the agency to regulate in \nthe interest of nursing home residents’ health and safety. Id. at 40879, 40890-91. But CMS lacks \nthe authority to override Congress’s stated policy as enacted in the statute that empowers CMS to \nregulate in the first place. Moreover, imposing $4.3 billion dollars of cost per year on nursing homes \nacross the country without statutory authorization violates the Major Questions Doctrine. \n7.  Regardless,  CMS’s  rule  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  violation  of  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). CMS’s longstanding agency position has been that \nnursing facilities caring for diverse resident populations with varying needs require a flexible \nregulatory approach. The new Final Rule does the exact opposite without considering the cost, \nfeasibility, or preexisting reliance interests. \n2 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 3 of 35   PageID 3\n8.  CMS’s Final Rule recognizes that the new requirements will force “more than 79 \npercent of nursing facilities nationwide” to hire more staff. 89 Fed. Reg.  at 40877. At the same \ntime,  CMS  agreed  that  most  nursing  homes  are  already  adequately  staffed.  CMS  has  not \narticulated why minimum staff requirements are needed, nor has CMS taken into account the \nmassive nationwide nursing shortage that will make compliance for many long-term care facilities \na practical impossibility. \n9.   CMS recognizes that “Texas will need to hire the most [additional] RNs” of any \nstate to comply with new requirements—about 2,579 RNs and 7,887 additional NAs, representing \na 46.1% increase in RNs and a 28.4% increase in NAs. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40957, 40976-80. Texas does \nnot have enough qualified people to hire to fill these newly required positions. See id. Moreover, \nsmaller facilities in rural areas may disproportionately bear the impact of the regulations because \nthey have to compete for employees against larger, urban facilities with more resources. See ACHA \nComments  on  Proposed  Rule  21,  31  (Nov.  6,  2023),  10,  available  at \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/comment/CMS-2023-0144-43877. \n10.  CMS recognizes that Texas facilities alone will need to spend half a billion dollars \nper year to comply with the requirements—$84 million on the 24/7 RN requirement, and $409 \nmillion on the HRPD requirements. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40958, 40960, 40983. \n11.  In creating this Final Rule, CMS primarily relied on a flawed study that does not \neven support CMS’s chosen staffing levels. Nowhere does CMS articulate the supposed benefit of \nthe minimum nurse staffing levels.  \n12.  The extra costs will put long-term care facilities out of business to the detriment of \ntheir residents and of future residents who will have fewer choices. \n13.  The Final Rule lacks statutory authority and is arbitrary and capricious. The Court \nshould vacate it, set it aside, and permanently enjoin its enforcement. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n \nI.  PARTIES \n14.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 702 and 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331. This Court has authority to grant the remedy Texas seeks pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201 and 2202 and 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n20.  42 U.S.C. § 1395ii, incorporating 42 U.S.C. § 405(h), is not a jurisdictional bar to \nthis suit because: \n(1)  Texas is not an “institution or agency” that is dissatisfied with a determination of the \nSecretary  and  who  is  entitled  to  an  administrative  hearing.  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1395cc(h)(1)(A); Texas v.

Apr. 11, 2022); \n(2)  Texas has a procedural right to bring claims under the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”). Becerra, 575 F. Supp. 3d at 712;  \n(3)  Texas’s claims arise under both the Medicaid Act, to which the jurisdictional bar does \nnot apply, and the Medicare Act. Becerra, 575 F. Supp. 3d at 712; Biden, 571 F. Supp. \n3d at 1086.  \n4 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 5 of 35   PageID 5\n(4)  Exhaustion of remedies under 42 U.S.C. § 405(h) would prove futile. Shalala v. Illinois \nCouncil on Long Term Care, Inc., 529 U.S. 1, 13 (2000); McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. \n140, 147–148 (1992); and \n(5)  Even if the above reasons did not apply—which they do—42 U.S.C. § 1395ii does not \napply to challenges to the validity of regulations and does not apply to this case. Ill. \nCouncil, 529 U.S. at 33 (Thomas, J., dissenting, joined by Stevens, and Kennedy, JJ., \nand in relevant part by Scalia. J. (cleaned up)). Ill. Council’s holding to the contrary \nshould be overruled. \n21.  Venue is proper in this district pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 703 and 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e), \nas two United States agencies, and two of its officers in their official capacities are defendants. \nPlaintiff Texas resides in this judicial district, and a substantial part of the events or omissions \ngiving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this district.  \nIII.  BACKGROUND \ni.  Medicare and Medicaid \nA. The Statutory Provisions \n22.  Medicare is a federal program that “provides basic protection against the costs of \nhospital, related post-hospital, home health services, and hospice care” to individuals 65 and older, \nas well as those with certain disabilities or conditions. 42 U.S.C. § 1395c. Medicaid is a joint \nfederal-state program that provides “payment of part or all of the cost of [certain] care and \nservices” and “rehabilitation and other services to help such families and individuals attain or \nretain capability for independence or self-care” to low-income individuals. 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1, \n1396a, 1396d(a). \n23.  Nursing homes that wish to participate in Medicare must comply with the statutory \nrequirements for “skilled nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3. Nursing homes that \nwish to participate in Medicaid must meet the largely parallel set of statutory requirements for \n“nursing facilities” set forth at 42 U.S.C. § 1396r. \n5 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 6 of 35   PageID 6\n24.  Skilled nursing facilities (Medicare) and nursing facilities (Medicaid) are often \ncollectively referred to as “long-term care facilities.” See, e.g., 42 CFR Subpart B (“Requirements \nfor Long Term Care Facilities”) (providing requirements for both skilled nursing facilities and \nnursing facilities). \n25.  The collective term is convenient for referring to both types of facilities because the \nrelevant statutory requirements for the two types of facilities are parallel or identical. \n26.  Subsection (b)(4)(C) of 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 (Medicare) is entitled “Required \nnursing care.” \n27.  Subsection (b)(4)(C) of 42 U.S.C. § 1396r (Medicaid) is entitled “Required nursing \ncare; facility waivers.” \n28.  Both subsections establish minimum required levels of nursing care that long-term \nfacilities must provide in order to participate in Medicare or Medicaid. \n29.  No other subsection of 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3 (Medicare) or 42 U.S.C. § 1396r \n(Medicaid) explicitly addresses required levels of nursing care that long-term facilities must \nprovide in order to participate. \n30.  Both types of long-term care facilities “must provide 24-hour licensed nursing \nservice which is sufficient to meet the nursing needs its residents.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) \n(Medicare);  42  U.S.C.  § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I)  (Medicaid)  (with  non-substantive  grammatical \nmodifications). \n31.  Both types of long-term care facilities “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i) (Medicare); 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(II) (Medicaid). \n32.  The Secretary of Health and Human Services may waive those requirements for \nskilled nursing facilities subject to Medicare rules under some conditions. 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i), (ii). A State may waive those requirements under some circumstances for nursing \nfacilities subject to Medicaid rules under similar conditions, but the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services “shall assume and exercise the authority of the State to grant waivers” if the \n6 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 7 of 35   PageID 7\nSecretary “determines that a State has shown a clear pattern and practice of allowing waivers in \nthe  absence  of  diligent  efforts  by  facilities  to  meet  the  staffing  requirements.”  42  U.S.C. \n§ 1396r(b)(4)(C) (i), (ii), (iii). \n33.  Neither 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C) (Medicare) nor 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C) \n(Medicaid)  authorizes  the  Secretary  to  set  an  identical  number  of  hours  per  resident  day \n(“HPRD”) of total nurse staffing for every long-term care facility, regardless of their residents’ \nactual needs and regardless of differing needs for differing facilities, rather than require nursing \nservices “sufficient to meet the nursing needs” of each facility’s residents. \n34.  Neither 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C) (Medicare) nor 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C) \n(Medicaid) authorize the Secretary to set an identical HRPD for Registered Nurse (“RN”) staffing \nfor every long-term care facility, regardless of their residents’ actual needs and regardless of \ndiffering needs for differing facilities, rather than require nursing services “sufficient to meet the \nnursing needs” of each facility’s residents. \n35.  Neither 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C) (Medicare) nor 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C) \n(Medicaid) authorize the Secretary to set an identical HRPD for nurse aid staffing for every long-\nterm care facility, regardless of their residents’ actual needs and regardless of differing needs for \ndiffering long-term facilities, rather than require nursing services “sufficient to meet the nursing \nneeds” of each facility’s residents. \n36.  Neither 42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C) (Medicare) nor 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C) \n(Medicaid) authorize the Secretary to increase or otherwise modify the number of hours for which \nlong-term facilities must use the services of a registered professional nurse from “at least 8 \nconsecutive hours a day, 7 days a week.” \nB.  No Substantive Statutory Changes to Nursing-staffing Requirements \n37.  The original enactment of the Medicare and Medicaid programs defined “extended \ncare facility” as an institution that, among other things, “provides 24-hour nursing service which \nis sufficient to meet nursing needs in accordance with the policies developed as provided in \n7 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 8 of 35   PageID 8\nparagraph (2), and has at least one registered professional nurse employed full time.” Pub. L. No. \n89-97 § 1861(j)(6), 79 Stat. 286, 317 (July 30, 1965). \n38.  It also defined “extended care services” as certain “services furnished to an \ninpatient of an extended care facility.” Id. § 1861(j)(h), 79 Stat. at 316. \n39.  It also provided benefits for Medicare participants receiving extended care services. \nId. at § 226(a), (b), 79 Stat. at 290. \n40.  Thus, extended care facilities wishing to participate in Medicare had to comply with \n(1) a 24-hour nursing service requirement and (2) a full-time employed registered professional \nnurse requirement. \n41.  In 1972, the statute was amended to replace the term “extended care facility” with \n“skilled nursing facility.” Pub. L. No. 92-603, § 278, 86 Stat. 1329, 1424–25, 1426–27 (Oct. 30, \n1972). \n42.  It was also amended to apply the 24-hour nursing service requirement and the full-\ntime employed registered professional nurse requirement to benefits for both Medicare and \nMedicaid participants receiving services at skilled nursing facilities. Id. at §§ 246, 249A, 86 Stat. \nat 1453–54. \n43.  It was also amended to include the first version of the waiver provisions. Id. § 267, \n86 Stat. at 1450. \n44.  42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i), the statute requiring a certain level of nursing care \nin skilled nursing facilities participating in Medicare, was enacted in its current form in 1987 and \n1988. Pub. L. No. 100-203 § 4201(a)(3), 101 Stat. 1330, 1330-160 (Dec. 22, 1987) (adding 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1395i-3); 1330-163 (adding subsection (b)(4)(C)(i)); Pub. L. No. 100-360 § 411(l)(1)(A)(ii), 101 \nStat. 683, 800–01 (Jul. 1, 1988) (making technical corrections to subsection (b)(4)(C)(i)). \n45.  The only non-stylistic difference from the prior statute was replacing “has at least \none registered professional nurse employed full time” with “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week” (the 8/7 requirement). Id. \n46.  There have not been any changes to 42 U.S.C. § 1396i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) since 1988. \n8 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 9 of 35   PageID 9\n47.  Likewise, 42 U.S.C. § 1396(b)(4)(C)(i), the statute requiring a certain level of \nnursing care in nursing facilities participating in Medicaid, was also enacted in its current form in \n1987 and 1988. Pub. L. No. 100-203 § 4211(a)(3), 101 Stat. at 1330-183–184 (adding 42 U.S.C. \n§ 1396r), 1330-186 (adding subsection (b)(4)(C)(i)); Pub. L. No. 100-360 § 4ii(l)(3)(A)(i), (ii), 101 \nStat. 683 at 802 (making technical corrections to subsection (b)(4)(C)(i)). \n48.  The only non-stylistic difference from the prior statute was replacing “has at least \none registered professional nurse employed full time” with “must use the services of a registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week” (the 8/7 requirement). Id. \n49.  There have not been any changes to 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i) since 1988. \n50.  In sum, the Medicare rules since 1965, and the Medicaid rules since 1972, have \nrequired both types of long-term care facilities to comply with (1) the 24-hour nursing service \nrequirement, and (2) the full-time employed registered professional nurse requirement, which was \nslightly changed to the 8/7 requirement in 1987. \n51.  Significantly, in 1973, the year after the statute was first amended, the Social \nSecurity Administration specifically rejected calls in the notice and comment period to implement \nnurse-to-patient ratios. 39 Fed. Reg. 2238, 2239 (Jan. 17, 1974). The agency reasoned that “the \nvariation from facility to facility in the composition of its nursing staff, physical layout, patient \nneeds[,] and the services necessary to meet those needs precludes setting such a figure.” Id. It \nfurther reasoned that “[a] minimum ratio could result in all facilities striving only to reach that \nminimum and could result in other facilities hiring unneeded staff to satisfy an arbitrary quota.” \nId.  \n52.  In 2016, CMS again rejected “many comments” urging CMS to “establish and \nrequire minimum staffing levels and require a registered nurse to be in the LTC facility 24 hours a \nday, 7 days a week.”81 Fed. Reg. 68688, 68754 (Oct. 4, 2016). CMS concluded that “a ‘one size \nfits all’ approach” to staffing was inappropriate. Id. at 68755. It expressed “concerns about \nmandatory ratios” and “a 24/7 RN presence” because “LTC facilities are varied in their structure \nand in their resident populations.” Id. at 68754-56, 68758; see also 80 Fed. Reg. 42168, 42201 (July \n9 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 10 of 35   PageID 10\n16, 2015) (emphasizing the importance of “taking acuity levels into account”). Instead, the \n“focus” of CMS regulations “should be on the skill sets and specific competencies of assigned \nstaff to provide the nursing care a resident needs rather than a static number of staff or hours of \nnursing care.” Id. at 42201. CMS further reasoned that a 24/7 RN requirement “could negatively \nimpact the development of innovative care options, particular[ly] in smaller, more home-like \nsettings,” and that “geographic disparity in supply could make such a mandate particularly \nchallenging in some rural and underserved areas.” 81 Fed. Reg. at 68755. \n \nii.  The Final Rule \nA. The Administration’s Announcement and the Staffing Study \n53.  On February 28, 2022, the Biden Administration announced a “reform” that “will \nensure that every nursing home provides a sufficient number of staff who are adequately trained to \nprovide high-quality care.” FACT SHEET: Protecting Seniors by Improving Safety and Quality \nof Care in the Nation’s Nursing Homes, Feb. 24, 2022.1 \n54.  The Fact Sheet elaborated on what it also labelled a “new initiative”: \nEstablish a Minimum Nursing Home Staffing Requirement. The adequacy of a \nnursing home’s staffing is the measure most closely linked to the quality of care \nresidents receive. For example, a recent study of one state’s nursing facilities2 found \nthat increasing registered nurse staffing by just 20 minutes per resident day was \nassociated with 22% fewer confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 26% fewer COVID-\n19 deaths. CMS intends to propose minimum standards for staffing adequacy that \nnursing homes must meet. CMS will conduct a new research study to determine the \nlevel and type of staffing needed to ensure safe and quality care and will issue \nproposed rules within one year. Establishing a minimum staffing level ensures that \nall nursing home residents are provided safe, quality care, and that workers have \n \n1   https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/02/28/fact-sheet-\nprotecting-seniors-and-people-with-disabilities-by-improving-safety-and-quality-of-care-in-\nthe-nations-nursing-homes/   \n2   Li, Temkin-Greener, Shan, & Cai, “COVID-19 Infections and Deaths among Connecticut \nNursing  Home  Residents:  Facility  Correlates”  (available  at \nhttps://agsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jgs.16689) \n10 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 11 of 35   PageID 11\nthe support they need to provide high-quality care. Nursing homes will be held \naccountable if they fail to meet this standard. \nId. \n55.  “Hours per resident day” (“HPRD”) means the average hours of care that each \nresident receives per day. Thus, when the Fact Sheet says that “increasing registered nurse staffing \nby just 20 minutes per resident day,” then in the case of a facility with 50 residents, that is an \nincrease of “just” 1,000 minutes of care, which is a little more than an additional 16 hours of care \nper day, or 116 hours a week. In other words, it is “just” three additional 40-hour-a-week positions \nfor 50 residents. \n56.  As directed in the Fact Sheet, CMS commissioned a private firm, Abt Associates, \nto perform the “new research study to determine the level and type of staffing needed to ensure \nsafe and quality care” (the “Abt Staffing Study”).3 \n57.  The Abt Associates “study was conducted on a compressed timeframe, with data \ncollection and analysis included in this report primarily completed between June and December \n2022. The short duration reflects the time-sensitive nature of the study and CMS’s timeline for \nproposing a minimum staffing requirement in support of the Presidential initiative.” Abt Staffing \nStudy at xix. \n58.  Abt Associates noted, “Nurse staffing levels vary considerably across nursing \nhomes nationwide, and by nursing home characteristics such as location, size, and profit status. \nFederal regulations require nurse staff availability 24 hours a day, but do not specify a minimum \nstaffing  level.  Thirty-eight  states  and  the  District  of  Columbia  have  a  minimum  staffing \nrequirement.” Id. at xi. \n59.  Texas does not have a minimum staffing requirement. \n \n3   Abt  Associates,  “Nursing  Home  Staffing  Study:  Comprehensive  Report”  (available  at \nhttps://www.cms.gov/files/document/nursing-home-staffing-study-final-report-appendix-\njune-2023.pdf) \n11 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 12 of 35   PageID 12\n60.  Abt Associates performed a review of literature studying “the relationship between \nnursing home staffing and quality outcomes,” and concluded the literature “does not provide a \nclear evidence basis for setting a minimum staffing level.” Id. at xi. \n61.  Abt Associates included a Connecticut study cited in the Fact Sheet as part of its \nliterature review and determined that the Connecticut study’s results were not generalizable, id. at \nA-35, despite the Administration’s use of that study in the Fact Sheet to generalize. \na.  Nursing Home Quality \n62.  Abt Associates then attempted to measure “the relationship between nursing home \nstaffing and quality outcomes” itself by creating “quality measure” (or QM) scores and a health \ninspection survey score. \n63.  Abt Associates “calculated a composite measure of nursing home quality, referred \nto hereafter as the ‘total QM [quality measures] score” for each nursing home. Id. at 41. It \nconsidered  several  short-term  and  long-term  measures  in  calculating  QMs  but  eliminated \nmeasures that “were weakly or not significantly related to nursing home staffing levels.” Id. Thus, \nAbt Associates’ QM scores are significantly related to nursing home staffing levels—in other \nwords, Abt Associates’ QM scores simply measure nursing home staffing levels, not “quality.” \n64.  Abt Associates admits that “though these QM data capture a wide range of quality \nand safety metrics, there are important dimensions of quality that are meaningful for residents or \nother stakeholders (e.g., quality of life) that these analyses are unlikely to capture.” Id. at 65. \n65.  In other words, Abt Associates’ quality measure scores do not measure quality of \nlife and “other important dimensions of quality.” \n66.  But Abt Associates’ QM scores do measure nursing home staff levels. \nb.  Nursing Home Safety \n67.  Abt Associates also calculated a within-states health inspection survey score, which \nit stated is “a proxy for nursing care safety.” Id. at 53. \n12 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 13 of 35   PageID 13\n68.  “One challenge to using health inspection data for safety outcomes is that health \ninspection surveys are not uniformly implemented across states. Therefore, all measures of health \ninspection performance must be converted into a form that allows comparison of nursing homes in \ndifferent states.” Id. at 80. \n69.  For each State, Abt Associates ranked each nursing home “according to their total \nscores on the latest health inspection survey by the end of the year” and assigned a score of 0 to \n100, depending on where a nursing home was ranked. Id. at G-2. \n70.  Thus, Abt Associates assigns a nursing home a health inspection score only in \nrelation to its score compared to other nursing homes in its State—not with respect to any \nparticular level of care, and completely  unrelated  to whether the nursing home passed the \ninspection. \n71.  For instance, in a State where all nursing homes passed inspection, Abt Associates \nwould assign 50% of the nursing homes in the state a below-average health inspection score. \n72.  Thus, Abt Associates’ health inspection score for a nursing home does not measure \nwhether the nursing home passed health inspections. \n73.  Abt Associates admits that “[t]here are differences in results of health inspection \nsurveys across states that might not be related to quality of care.” Id. at 65. \nc.  The Relative, Not Absolute, Nursing Home Quality and Safety Measures \n74.  Abt Associates used “two definitions of minimally acceptable quality and safety \nstandards, based on the 25th and 50th percentiles of the total QM score and the within-state health \ninspection survey score.” Abt Staffing Study at 112. \n75.  In other words, Abt Associates defines “minimally acceptable quality and safety \nstandards” for nursing homes relatively (compared to each other), not absolutely (compared to \nobjective quality and safety standards). \n13 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 14 of 35   PageID 14\n76.  Thus, no matter how high (or low) QM scores and health inspection survey scores \nare, 50% or 25% of nursing homes will always be found to fail to meet “minimally acceptable quality \nand safety standards” under Abt Associates’ methodology. \n77.  In an example of a State where all nursing homes passed inspection, Abt Associates \nwould nevertheless say that 50% or 25% of the nursing homes in the State failed to meet minimally \nacceptable safety standards because there are always nursing homes ranked in the lower half or the \nlowest quarter. \n78.  So, no matter what percentage of nursing homes pass inspection in a State, Abt \nAssociates would conclude that 50% or 25% failed to meet minimally acceptable safety standards \nbecause there will always be nursing homes ranked in the lower half or the lowest quarter. \n79.  Even if the percentage of nursing homes pass inspection in a State goes up or \ndown—even greatly up or greatly down—Abt Associates would always find that 50% or 25% of the \nnursing homes in the State failed to meet minimally acceptable safety standards because there are \nalways nursing homes ranked in the lower half or the lowest quarter. \n80.  Likewise, no matter what distribution of QM Abt Associates calculates, and no \nmatter if those numbers go up or go down, Abt Associates would always say that 50% or 25% of \nnursing homes in the country failed to meet minimally acceptable quality standards because there \nare always nursing homes ranked in the lower half or the lowest quarter. \nd.  The Irrelevance of Predicted Probability of Ranking in the Top 50% or 75% of \n“Quality” and “Safety” Based on Staffing Levels \n81.  Abt Associates produced a chart of “Predicted Probability of Exceeding Minimum \nAcceptable Quality Standards for Total QM Score, by Total Nurse Staffing Level.” Id. at 50–52. \n82.  Abt Associates divided all nursing homes into ten deciles, based on nursing hours \nper resident day, and then predicted the probability of a nursing home in one of the ten deciles \nbeing in the top 50% or top 75% of the ranking of QM scores. \n14 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 15 of 35   PageID 15\n83.  Since QM scores measure nursing staffing levels, it is not surprising that Abt \nAssociates predicts that nursing homes in the bottom deciles of nursing staffing are less likely than \nnursing homes in the top deciles to be in top 50% or top 75% of the ranking of QM scores. \n84.  Even so, and even if the chart had any relevance at all to quality measures, the \ncorrelation between nursing staffing levels and being in the top 50% or top 75% of QM scores is \nweak. 40.9% of nursing homes in the bottom 20% of nursing staff levels are predicted to be in the \ntop 50% of QM scores, and 61.2% of nursing homes in the top 10% of nursing staff levels are \npredicted to be in the top 50% of QM scores. And 66.9% of nursing homes in the bottom 20% of \nnursing staff levels are predicted to be in the top 75% of QM scores, and 85.1% of nursing homes in \nthe top 10% of nursing staff levels are predicted to be in the top 75% of QM scores. Id. at 49–50. \n85.  At the 50% level, Abt Associates notes, “This increase from 40.9 percent to 61.2 \nrepresents a gain with increasing total nurse staffing of more than 20 percentage points.” At the \n75% level, it notes “a gain with increasing total nurse staffing of more than 18 percentage points.” \nId. \n86.  But,  more  relevantly,  the  numbers  show  that  nursing  staffing  levels  do  not \nguarantee any great likelihood of whether a nursing home is predicted to be in the top 50% or 75% \nof the ranking of Abt Associates’ QM score rankings. All nursing homes are predicted to have \nbetween a 40.9% to 61% chance of being in the top 50%, and between a 66.9% and 85.1% chance of \nbeing in the top 75%, no matter what its nursing staffing levels. \n87.  Abt  Associates  also  produced  a  chart  of  “Predicted  Probability  of Exceeding \nMinimum Acceptable Quality Standards for Weighted Health Inspection Survey Score, by Total \nNurse Staffing Level.” Id. at 53–55. \n88.  Abt Associates divided all nursing homes into ten deciles, based on nursing hours \nper resident day, and then predicted the probability of a nursing home in one of the ten deciles \nbeing in the top 50% or top 75% in the ranking of health inspection survey scores. \n89.  The correlation between nursing staffing levels and being in the top 50% or top 75% \nof health inspection survey scores is weak. Even if the chart had any relevance at all to health \n15 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 16 of 35   PageID 16\nmeasures, 37.8% of nursing homes in the bottom 20% of nursing staff levels are predicted to be in \nthe top 50% of health inspection ranking scores, and 72.7% of nursing homes in the top 10% of \nnursing staff levels are predicted to be in the top 50% of health inspection survey scores. And 64.5% \nof nursing homes in the bottom 20% of nursing staff levels are predicted to be in the top 75% of \nhealth inspection survey scores, and 89.7% of nursing homes in the top 10% of nursing staff levels \nare predicted to be in the top 75% of health inspection survey scores. Id. at 53. \n90.  At the 50% level, Abt Associates notes, “The increase between the lowest and \nhighest deciles examined is 34.9 percentage points.” At the 75% level, it notes “a gain of 25.2 \npercentage points.” Id. \n91.  But, again, more relevantly, the numbers show that nursing staffing levels do not \nguarantee any great likelihood of whether a nursing home is predicted to be in the top 50% or 75% \nof Abt Associates’ health inspection survey score rankings. All nursing homes are predicted to have \nbetween a 37.8% to 72.7% chance of being in the top 50%, and between a 64.5% and 89.7% chance of \nbeing in the top 75%, no matter what its nursing staffing levels. \ne.  The Irrelevance of “What if” Scenarios Based on the Predicted Probabilities \n92.  Abt Associates “predicted probabilities from the logistic regression model results \ndescribed above to generate ‘what-if’ scenarios representing the percentage of nursing homes \npredicted to exceed the 50th and 25th percentile performance standards under different minimum \nstaffing requirements. The intent of these analyses is to model changes in predicted quality and \nsafety associated with implementing potential minimum staffing requirements.” Id. at 56. \n93.  It analyzed twelve possible minimum staffing requirement options: \n(1) a three-requirement structure for hours per resident day (total nurse staffing, total \nlicensed nurse staffing, and RN staffing) at four levels: \nlow  3.30 total, 1.15 licensed, 0.45 RN \nmedium  3.48 total, 1.23 licensed, 0.52 RN \nhigher  3.67 total, 1.32 licensed, 0.60 RN \n16 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 17 of 35   PageID 17\nhighest  3.88 total, 1.43 licensed, 0.70 RN \n(2) a two-requirement structure for hours per resident day (RN, nurse aides (NA)) at four \nlevels: \nlow  0.45 RN, 2.15 NA \nmedium  0.52 RN, 2.25 NA \nhigher  0.60 RN, 2.35 NA \nhighest   0.70 RN, 2.45 NA \n(3) a four-requirement structure for hours per resident day (total nurse staffing, RNs, \nLVNs,4 and NA) at four levels: \nlow  3.30 total, 0.45 RN, 0.70 LVN, 2.15 NA \nmedium  3.48 total, 0.52 RN, 0.71 LVN, 2.25 NA \nhigher  3.67 total, 0.60 RN, 0.72 LVN, 2.35 NA \nhighest  3.88 total, 0.70 RN, 0.73 LVN, 2.45 NA \nId. at xiv–xvii. \n94.  Abt Associates predicted that between 43% and 90% of long-term facilities would \nhave to add staff to comply with the twelve minimum staffing requirements, depending on the \nrequirement. Id. \n95.  It also predicted the costs of each of the twelve requirements at between $1.5 billion \nand $6.8 billion per year, depending on the requirement. Id. \n96.  It also stated that 49% of long-term care facilities currently achieve a quality measure \nscore above the median without any minimum staffing requirements but predicted that between \n49% and 57% would achieve a quality measure score above the current median under the twelve \nrequirements, depending on the requirement. Id. \n \n4   Abt Associates uses “LPN” to stand for “licensed practical/vocational nurses.” Abt Staffing \nStudy at 124. LPN and LVN are substantively the same. Different  States use different \nterminology. Texas will use the Texas term, “LVN,” in this complaint. \n17 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 18 of 35   PageID 18\n97.  It also stated that 74% of long-term care facilities currently achieve a quality measure \nscore above the lowest quartile without any minimum staffing requirements but predicted that \nbetween 76% and 82% would achieve a quality measure score above the current lowest quartile \nunder the twelve requirements, depending on the requirement. Id.  \n98.  It  also stated  that  50%  of long-term  care  facilities  currently  achieve  a  health \ninspection  safety  score  above  the  median  without  any  minimum  staffing  requirements  but \npredicted that between 51% and 53% would achieve a health inspection safety score above the \ncurrent median under the twelve requirements, depending on the requirement. Id. \n99.  It  also  stated  that  74%  of  long-term  care  facilities  currently  achieve  a  health \ninspection safety score above the lowest quartile without any minimum staffing requirements but \npredicted that between 76% and 79% would achieve a health inspection safety score above the \ncurrent lowest quartile under the twelve requirements, depending on the requirement. Id. \n100.  As Abt Associates summed it up: “The predicted percentage of nursing homes \nexceeding minimally acceptable quality and safety thresholds would increase between 1 percentage \npoint and nearly 8 percentage points across four potential minimum staffing requirement options \nranging from low (below the current median) to high total nurse staffing.” Id. at vii (first “key \ntakeaway” from the study). \n101.  In fact, under one of the twelve possible requirements (the three-requirement \nstructure, medium level), Abt Associates says that the percentage of nursing homes exceeding \nminimally acceptable quality thresholds would increase 0 percentage points (from 49% to 49%). Id. \nat xiv, xv. \n102.  Although Abt Associates does not say so, to the extent that QM and health \ninspection survey scores would be increased by imposing one of the twelve “what-if” scenarios, \nthat would generate new 25th and 50th percentiles and thus 25% or 50% of nursing homes would \nstill fall below “minimally acceptable quality and safety standards” as defined by Abt Associates. \n103.  Thus, the “increases” to which Abt Associates refers are in relation to the former \n25th and 50th percentiles, not the new ones. These increases are irrelevant since many nursing \n18 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 19 of 35   PageID 19\nhomes with increased scores would still be deemed to fall below “minimally acceptable quality and \nsafety standards” under the newly calculated 25th and 50th percentiles. \n104.  Nonetheless, even giving Abt Associates the benefit of the doubt, it believes that \neither 50% or 25% of long-term care facilities currently do not meet minimally acceptable quality \nand safety standards, but that between 0% and 8% more would meet minimally acceptable quality \nand safety standards if the government imposed one of the twelve proposed minimum staffing \nrequirements—at a cost of between $1.5 billion and $6.8 billion per year, and which would require \nthat between 43% and 90% of long-term facilities hire additional staff. \nf.  Abt Associates Fails to Discuss any Need for 24/7 Nursing Services \n105.  Nothing in the Abt Staffing Study supports the idea that all long-term care facilities \nmust have a registered nurse onsite 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. \n106.  In fact, Abt Associates notes that “[o]nly six [S]tates require an RN on site 24 hours \na day regardless of facility size.” Abt Staffing Study at A-10. \ng.  Abt Associates Conclusion that There is Only Evidence of Potential Benefits \nof Minimum Nursing Staffing Requirements in Long-term Care Facilities \n107.  The best Abt Associates can say to begin its conclusion is that “[c]ollectively, the \nStaffing Study provides evidence both on potential minimum staffing requirement benefits and on \npotential barriers to and unintended consequences of implementation.” Id. at 121 (emphasis \nadded). \n108.  Abt Associates presumably tried very hard to “propos[e] a minimum staffing \nrequirement in support of the President’s initiative,” and looked very hard for evidence of \nminimum staffing requirement benefit—but could only find evidence of “potential” benefits. \n109.  Necessarily, evidence of potential benefits is also evidence of no benefits. \n110.  The study does not in fact show any real or “potential” benefits resulting from \nsmall increases in irrelevant QM scores and health inspection survey scores resulting from very \nexpensive minimum staffing requirements which would result in 43 to 90 percent of nursing homes \nhaving to increase staffing. \n19 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 20 of 35   PageID 20\n111.  Abt Associates noted the possibility that “workforce shortages and current hiring \nchallenges  could  present  barriers  to  nursing  home  compliance  with  a  new  federal  staffing \nrequirement.” Id. at xxi. But it disregarded that possibility and “did not comprehensively address \nthe feasibility of implementing a minimum staffing requirement and did not review national health \ncare staffing shortages, health care workforce distribution, or access to health care training and \neducation programs.” Id. \n112.  It also noted, but disregarded, “several potential unintended consequences of a \nnational minimum staffing requirement, such as that nursing homes might i) not be able to meet \nthe required staffing levels; ii) reduce resident admissions to meet requirements; or iii) close down \nentirely, thus potentially reducing access to care.” Id. \nB.  The Final Rule \na.  CMS uses the Abt Staffing Study to justify the Final Rule \n113.  Armed with the Abt Staffing Study that incorrectly asserted potential minimum \nstaffing requirement benefits,  CMS adopted the  Final  Rule that imposes minimum staffing \nrequirements. \n114.  Citing only the Abt Staffing Study, CMS claims that “the minimum staffing \nstandard is supported by literature evidence, analysis of staffing data and health outcomes, \ndiscussions with residents, staff, and industry.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877 and n.8. \n115.  CMS  claims  that  “the  minimum  staffing  standard  is  supported  by  …  other \nfactors.” Id. It later specifies that the “other factors” were “two listening sessions.” 89 Fed. Reg. \nat 40881. \n116.  CMS adopted Abt Associates’ evidence-free conclusions that “[i]ncreasing nursing \nstaffing levels are associated with benefits including enhanced safety and quality.” Id. \n117.  It also agreed with Abt Associates that “[t]here is no clear, consistent, and universal \nmethodology for setting specific minimum staffing standards, as evidenced by the varying current \n20 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 21 of 35   PageID 21\nstandards across the 38 States and the District of Columbia that have adopted their own staffing \nstandards.” Id. \n118.  CMS set specific minimum staffing standards anyway. \nb.  The Rule’s Substance \n119.  The  statute  requires  long-term  facilities  to  “use  the  services  of  a  registered \nprofessional nurse for at least 8 consecutive hours a day, 7 days a week” (the 8/7 requirement) 42 \nU.S.C. §§ § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i), 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(II). \n120.  But the Final Rule requires long-term care facilities to “have a registered nurse \n(RN) onsite 24 hours per day, for 7 days a week that is available to provide direct resident care” (a \n24/7 requirement). 89 Fed. Reg. at 40997. \n121.  The statute requires long-term facilities to “provide 24-hour licensed nursing \nservice  which  is  sufficient  to  meet  the  nursing  needs  its  residents.”  42  U.S.C.  § 1395i-\n3(b)(4)(C)(i); 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I). \n122.  In other words, current “[f]ederal regulations require nurse staff availability 24 \nhours a day, but do not specify a minimum staffing level. Thirty-eight states and the District of \nColumbia have a minimum staffing requirement.” Abt Staffing Study at xi. \n123.  But the Final Rule requires that “[t]he facility must meet or exceed a minimum of \n3.48 hours per resident day for total nurse staffing,” which must include a “minimum of 0.55 hours \nper resident day for registered nurses” and a “minimum of 2.45 hours per resident day for nurse \naides.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40996. \n124.  All long-care facilities must meet the staffing requirements “regardless of the \nindividual facility’s resident case-mix, as they are the minimum standard of staffing.” Id. at 40877. \nc.  CMS Does Not Explain the 24/7 Requirement \n125.  Nothing in the Final Rule explains why CMS imposed the 24/7 requirement or \nchanged the 8/7 requirement to the 24/7 requirement. \n21 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 22 of 35   PageID 22\n126.  Nothing in the Abt Staffing Study suggests that every long-term care facility \nrequires a registered nurse on site 24/7. \nd.  CMS Does Not Explain How it Chose the 3.48. 0.55, or 2.45 levels \n127.  The levels that CMS imposed do not match any of the twelve minimum staffing \nscenarios considered in the Abt Staffing Study. \n128.  In other words, the 3.48, 0.55, or 2.45 levels did not come from the Abt Staffing \nStudy. \n129.  CMS claims that the 3.48, 0.55, or 2.45 levels “were developed using case-mix \nadjusted data sources.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877. \n130.  It also states that the 0.55 and 2.45 levels (but not the 3.48 level) were discussed in \nthe notice of proposed rulemaking, 88 Fed. Reg. 61352 (Sep. 6, 2023). 89 Fed. Reg. at 40891. \n131.  In the notice of proposed rulemaking, CMS explained that “based on the findings \nreported in the [Abt Staffing Study], information gathered through the FY2023 SNF PPS RFI [a \nrequest for comments on minimum staffing requirements (see 88 Fed. Reg. at 61358)], listening \nsessions, assessment of the PBJ System data, and review of the literature evidence, we are \nproposing individual minimum staffing levels at 0.55 HPRD for RNs and 2.45 HPRD for NAs.” \n88 Fed. Reg. at 61369. \n132.  The Abt Staffing Study provides no evidence for the 0.55 or 2.45 levels. \n133.  A “review of the literature” did not provide evidence for the 0.55 or 2.45 levels \nbecause the literature “does not provide a clear evidence basis for setting a minimum staffing \nlevel.” Abt Staffing Study at xi. \n134.  CMS does not explain how “the FY2023 SNF PPS RFI, listening sessions, [or] \nassessment of the PBJ System data” provides evidence for the 0.55 or 2.45 levels. \n135.  CMS acknowledges that “[t]he proposed RN requirement of 0.55 HPRD is higher \nthan every State, and only lower than the District of Columbia. The proposed NA requirement of \n22 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 23 of 35   PageID 23\n2.45 HPRD is higher than all States and the District of Columbia, based on data from September \n2022.” 88 Fed. Reg. at 61367. \n136.  But CMS does not explain why every State in the union is wrong and CMS is right. \n137.  Finally, CMS has no explanation whatsoever for the 3.48 level, either in the notice \nof proposed rulemaking or the Final Rule, other than vaguely stating that it was “developed using \ncase-mix adjusted data sources,” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877, but necessarily different “case-mix \nadjusted sources” than those supposedly used to develop the 0.55 and 2.48 levels, which are \nfurther explained in the notice of proposed rulemaking. \n138.  The notice of proposed rulemaking seeks comments on the 3.48 level. 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 61,363. It does not seek comment on any other total nurse staffing level. Yet the notice of \nproposed rulemaking only explains (entirely insufficiently) how the 0.55 and 2.45 levels were \ndeveloped, not how the 3.48 level was developed. \ne.  Effects of the Final Rule \n139.  CMS estimates that the minimum staffing requirements will cost $4.3 billion per \nyear over the next ten years. 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,949, 40,970. \n140.  According to CMS, “[t]hese new required minimum staffing requirements will \nincrease staffing in more than 79 percent of nursing facilities nationwide, and the specific RN and \nNA HPRD requirements exceed the existing minimum staffing requirements in nearly all States.” \nId. at 40,877. \n141.  According to CMS, nationwide, the new required minimum staffing requirements \nwill require 10,495 additional RNs in urban areas (an increase of 9.7%), 35,306 additional NAs in \nurban areas (an increase of 9.9%), 2,144 RNs in rural areas (an increase of 8.0%), and 8,787 \nadditional NAs in rural areas (an increase of 9.2%). Id. at 40,958, 40,977–80 (showing increases due \nto the 24/7 requirement and the three hours per resident day requirements; Texas is citing only \nthe largest increase for RNs and NAs to avoid double-counting). \n23 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 24 of 35   PageID 24\n142.  According to CMS, in Texas the new required minimum staffing requirements will \nrequire 1,615 additional RNs in urban areas (an increase of 36.3%), 3,460 additional NAs in urban \nareas (an increase of 16.0%), 311 RNs in rural areas (an increase of 27.3%), and 1,067 additional NAs \nin rural areas (an increase of 17.4%). Id. \n143.  The Final Rule’s policies are to be phased in over the next several years. 89 Fed. \nReg. at 40,913. Facilities in non-rural areas must implement the 24/7 RN and the 3.48 total nurse \nhours per resident day requirements within 2 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 NA hours per \nresident day requirements within 3 years. Id. Rural facilities must implement the 24/7 RN and the \n3.48 total nurse hours per resident day requirements within 3 years and the 0.55 RN and 2.45 NA \nhours per resident day requirements within 5 years. Id. \n144.  Unlike Abt Associates, CMS does not attempt to quantify any benefits supposedly \nresulting from the minimum staffing levels in the Final Rule. \nC. The Claimed Authority for the Final Rule \na.  CMS  Explicitly  does  not  Rely  on  the  Subsection  Addressing  Long-term \nFacility Staffing Levels \n145.  CMS explains its legal authority to adopt the Final Rule thus: “While sections [42 \nU.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I), (II)] state that a facility must \nprovide 24-hour licensed nursing services which are sufficient to meet the nursing needs of its \nresidents, and must use the services of a registered professional nurse for at least 8 consecutive \nhours a day, 7 days a week, CMS is using separate authority as described above to establish these \nnew requirements rather than the authorities found at [42 U.S.C. § 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 42 \nU.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I), (II)].” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,891. \n146.  The  “separate  authority  described  above”  is  three  provisions  in  42  U.S.C. \n§§ 1395i-3 and 1396r. \n24 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 25 of 35   PageID 25\nb.  CMS Relies on a Subsection Addressing Miscellaneous Requirements  \n147.  First, CMS cites 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(d)(4)(B) and 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), which require \nlong-term care facilities to “meet such other requirements relating to the health, safety, and well-\nbeing of residents or relating to the physical facilities thereof as the Secretary may find necessary.” \n148.  CMS explains, “The Secretary has concluded that these HPRD levels and RN \nonsite 24/7 requirements are necessary for resident health, safety, and well-being, under [42 \nU.S.C.  §§ 1396r(d)(4)(B)  and  1395i-3(d)(4)(B)],  which  instruct  the  Secretary  to  issue  such \nregulations relating to the health, safety, and well-being of residents as the Secretary may find \nnecessary.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,890. \n149.  In both acts, subsection (d) is entitled “Requirements relating to administration and \nother matters.” \n150.  In  both  acts,  subsection  (d)(1)  is  entitled  “Administration”  and  deals  with \nadministration  in  general,  required  notices  of  changes  in  ownership  or  administrator,  and \navailability of reports. \n151.  In both acts, subsection (d)(2) is entitled “Licensing and Life Safety Code” and \nrequires long-term facilities to be state-licensed and to meet fire protection requirements. \n152.  In both acts, subsection (d)(3) is entitled “Sanitary and Infection Control and \nPhysical Environment” and requires a safe and sanitary environment. \n153.  In both acts, subsection (d)(4) is entitled “Miscellaneous,” subsection (d)(4)(A) is \nentitled  “Compliance  with  Federal,  State,  and  local  laws  and  professional  standards,”  and \nsubsection (d)(4)(B), on which CMS relies, is entitled “Other.” \n154.  Thus, subsection (d)(4)(B), on which CMS relies to set required long-term facility \nnursing staffing levels, addresses “other miscellaneous requirements relating to administration \nand other matters.” \n155.  Nothing in subsection (d), or subsection (d)(4)(B), specifically mentions required \nlong-term facility nursing staffing levels. \n25 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 26 of 35   PageID 26\n156.  But, in both statutes, subsection (b)(4)(C)(i), entitled “Required nursing care; \nfacility waivers,” specifically addresses required long-care facility nursing staffing levels. \nc.  CMS Relies on a Subsection Addressing Individual Plans for Resident Services \n157.  Second, CMS cites 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(2) and 1395i-3(b)(2), which require long-\nterm care facilities to “provide services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, \nmental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, in accordance with a written plan of care \nwhich” meets certain requirements and is “periodically reviewed and revised” under subsection \n(b)(3), which details how long-term care facilities must assess each resident individually. \n158.  In other words, this subsection concerns plans for services for individual residents. \n159.  According to CMS, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(2) and 1395i-3(b)(2) “require facilities \nto provide services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial \nwell-being of each resident, [and therefore] also supports CMS authority to establish these \nrequirements.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,890–91. \n160.  This subsection does not specifically mention required long-term facility nursing \nstaffing levels. \n161.  But, in both statutes, subsection (b)(4)(C)(i), entitled “Required nursing care; \nfacility waivers,” specifically addresses required long-care facility nursing staffing levels. \nd.  CMS Relies on a Subsection Requiring Long-term Facilities to have a Quality \nAssessment Committee \n162.  Third, CMS cites 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(1)(A) and 1395i-3(b)(1)(A), which require \nlong-term care facilities to “care for its residents in such a manner and in such an environment as \nwill promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each resident.” \n163.  CMS states that those subsections require long-term care facilities to “care for its \nresidents  in  such  a  manner  and  in  such  an  environment  as  will  promote  maintenance  or \nenhancement of the safety and quality of life of each resident.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,891. \n164.  But subsection (b)(1)(B) provides the method by which long-term facilities address \nresidents’ quality of life. They must “maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee … \n26 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 27 of 35   PageID 27\nwhich (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and \nassurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to \ncorrect identified quality deficiencies.” \n165.  Thus, in both statutes, subsection (b)(1) requires long-term facilities to make \ndecisions and does not mention any power of CMS to impose decisions on long-term care facilities. \n166.  In both statutes, subsection (b)(1) does not specifically mention required long-term \nfacility nursing staffing levels. \n167.  But, in both statutes, subsection (b)(4)(C)(i), entitled “Required nursing care; \nfacility waivers,” specifically addresses required long-term care facility nursing staffing levels. \nD. CMS’s explanation for its Newly Discovered Authority to Impose Minimum \nNursing Staffing Requirements \n168.  Since the nursing staffing statutes were first enacted in 1965 and 1972, and since \nthey were enacted in their current form in 1989, CMS has never before imposed minimum long-\nterm care facility minimum nursing staffing requirements. \n169.  CMS suggests that it is now able to do so because it now has “collected several years \nof mandated PBJ [Payroll-Based Journal] System data, which was unavailable [before], and new \nevidence from the literature.” 89 Fed. Reg. at 40,880. \n170.  CMS does not explain how previously unavailable PSJ System data allows it to \nimpose a minimum long-term care facility minimum nursing staffing requirement. \n171.  The “new evidence from the literature” can only mean the Abt Staffing Study, \nsince the literature before the Abt Staffing Study “does not provide a clear evidence basis for \nsetting a minimum staffing level.” Abt Staffing Study at xi. \nIV.  HOW THE RULE HURTS TEXAS \n172.  The Final Rule impacts Texas in two ways: as a State that regulates long-term care \nfacilities and as a State that administers Medicaid. \n173.  The  Texas  Health  and  Human  Services  Commission  (“HHSC”)  submitted \ncomments on the Final Rule. It noted that the Final Rule “will require extensive funding and \n27 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 28 of 35   PageID 28\ntraining for both the [state agency] staff and providers and will increase workload requirements for \n[State agencies].” Ex. A, HHSC Nov. 3, 2023, Comment letter at 1. \n174.  HHSC also noted that “Texas’ long-standing shortage of RNs and CNAs [certified \nnurse aides] and the high level of turnover of these staff in [Medicaid-participating facilities] may \nprevent many facilities from being able to comply, even with a good faith effort.” Id. \n175.  Moreover, HHSC noted that “Texas’ demand for RNs has long exceeded the \nsupply, and this deficit is projected to grow in future years. In 2018, there was a deficit of 27,786 \nRN FTEs [full time equivalent employees] in Texas, and by 2032, the deficit is expected to grow \nto 57,012 RN FTEs” and “nursing facilities are currently facing a deficit of between 7,000 and \n8,000 CNAs and that number could be upwards of 10,000 based on the high rates of staff turnover \nand currently vacant positions.” Id. at 1–2. \n176.  Further, HHSC stated that the Final Rule “will merely exacerbate the existing \nshortages and potentially set up nursing facilities for additional violations due to the inability to \nmeet the staffing requirements. This is especially true for the 24/7 RN requirement which would \nbe difficult to meet especially on nights and weekends. The costs of nursing care are already driving \nmany seniors out of the nursing home market and forcing many nursing facilities to close leaving \nsignificant gaps in service availability.” Id. at 3. \n177.  “Additionally,  the  establishment  and  management  of  this  process  places  an \nunfunded  burden  on  the  [state  agency]  responsible  for  survey  and  enforcement  of  these \nrequirements.” Id. \n178.  Multiple areas within HHSC will be responsible for ensuring compliance with the \nFinal  Rule.  It  affects  Long  Term  Care  Regulation,  Medicaid  and  CHIP  Services,  Quality \nMonitoring Program, and Regulatory Enforcement. Survey and enforcement of the new rules will \nincrease the workload for HHSC because it is an additional regulation to enforce and will require \nstaff time to assess compliance. HHSC anticipates an increase of citations of noncompliance, \nenforcement  remedies,  and  more  time  spent  (increased  workload)  during  surveys  and \ninvestigations. \n28 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 29 of 35   PageID 29\nV.  LEGAL ANALYSIS \nA.  The Final Rule violates the APA because it is contrary to statute and exceeds \nthe authority granted by Congress. \n179.  The Final Rule exceeds CMS’s statutory authority and therefore is invalid. \n180.  Defendants are agencies subject to the APA. \n181.  Under the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“not in accordance with law” or “in excess of statutory … authority[] or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C). \n182.  “[A]n agency literally has no power to act … unless and until Congress confers \npower upon it.” La. Pub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC, 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986). \n183.  “[O]ur system does not permit agencies to act unlawfully even in pursuit of \ndesirable ends.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 766 (2021). \n184.  As an agency, CMS may not impose nursing staffing requirements contrary to and \nin  excess  of  the  nursing  staffing  requirements set  by  42  U.S.C.  §§  1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i)  and \n1396r(b)(4)(C)(i). The Social Security Act itself confirms that the Secretary may not “publish . . . \nrules and regulations” that are “inconsistent with” the provisions of the Act. 42 U.S.C. § 1302(a); \nsee also 89 Fed. Reg. at 40897, 40898–99 (acknowledging that the detailed statutory scheme for \nwaiving the 8/7 RN requirement “can only be modified by legislation”). \n185.  CMS claims that the general requirements of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), 1395i-\n3(b)(2),  1395i-3(b)(1)(A),  1396r(d)(4)(B),  1396r(b)(2),  and  1396r(b)(1)(A)  allow it  to impose \nminimum staffing requirements. These provisions authorize regulation for health, safety, and \nquality of life—not staffing requirements. CMS cannot use these authorizations to contravene \nCongress’s specific policy choices expressed in the statutes with staffing requirements. \n186.  First, “It is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the \ngeneral…. The general/specific canon is perhaps most frequently applied to statutes in which a \ngeneral permission or prohibition is contradicted by a specific prohibition or permission…. But the \n29 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 30 of 35   PageID 30\ncanon has full application as well to statutes … in which a general authorization and a more limited, \nspecific  authorization  exist  side-by-side.  There  the  canon  avoids  not  contradiction  but  the \nsuperfluity of a specific provision that is swallowed by the general one, violating the cardinal rule \nthat, if possible, effect shall be given to every clause and part of a statute. The terms of the specific \nauthorization must be complied with.” RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 \nU.S. 639, 645 (2012) (cleaned up, citations omitted); see also Airlines for Am. v. Dep’t of Transp., \nNo. 24-60231, 2024 WL 3580314, at *2 (5th Cir. July 29, 2024) (“Reading the catch-all authority \nin [one statute] to justify the Rule would obliterate the directly applicable textual limits spelled out \nin  [another  statute]”);  see  also  Antonin  Scalia  &  Bryan  A.  Garner,  Reading  Law:  The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts 183 (2012) (“If there is a conflict between a general provision and a \nspecific provision, the specific provision controls.”). \n187.  CMS’s reading of the general requirements of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), \n1395i-3(b)(2), 1395i-3(b)(1)(A), 1396r(d)(4)(B), 1396r(b)(2), and 1396r(b)(1)(A) to justify the Final \nRule obliterates the textual limits in 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i). \n188.  Second, courts “expect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to \nexercise powers of vast economic and political significance.” Ala. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of \nHealth & Human Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021) (cleaned up). The “breadth of the authority” \nCMS asserts and “the economic and political significance” further confirm that CMS is exceeding \nits delegated authority. West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022). The history and practice \nof Congress in direct opposition to the CMS rule, as well as the fact that the rule would require \nmore than 79% of nursing facilities to increase staffing levels at a cost of over $5 billion per year \ndemonstrate that CMS has exceeded its delegated authority. See 89 Fed. Reg. at 40877, 40970. \n189.  Reading the general requirements of 42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), 1395i-3(b)(2), \n1395i-3(b)(1)(A), 1396r(d)(4)(B), 1396r(b)(2), and 1396r(b)(1)(A) to justify the Final Rule and \nimpose huge costs and requirements is a prohibited reading under the Major Questions Doctrine. \n30 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 31 of 35   PageID 31\nB.  The Final Rule violates the APA because it is arbitrary and capricious. \n190.  Under the APA, a court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n191.  The  APA’s  arbitrary-and-capricious  standard  requires  that  agency  action  be \n“reasonable and reasonably explained.”  Texas v. United States, 40 F.4th 205, 226 (5th Cir. \n2022)(quoting FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021)).  \n192.  Agency action must be set aside when the agency “fail[ed] to respond to significant \npoints . . . raised by the public comments.” Huawei Techs USA, Int’l v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, 449 (5th \nCir. 2021).  \n193.  CMS has failed to reasonably explain the 3.48, 0.55, and 2.45 nursing staff levels. \n194.  Whatever benefits  increased staffing may  theoretically  provide,  CMS has not \nexplained at all how setting these levels will improve quality of life for long-term care residents. \n195.  CMS relies on a flawed report (the Abt Staffing Study) that does not support the \nimposition of any minimum nurse staff levels at long-term care facilities and provides zero evidence \nin favor of the 3.48, 0.55, and 2.45 nursing staff levels. \n196.  CMS says it relies on other information to set the levels but does not explain how. \n197.  CMS does not explain how long-term care facilities can possibly comply with the \nFinal Rule, given the enormous costs it imposes and the well-known nursing shortage. \n198.  Therefore, the Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious. \n199.  Moreover, an agency must provide “a reasoned analysis for [a] change beyond that \nwhich may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance.” FCC v. Fox Television \nStations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 514 (2009). And “the agency must show that there are good reasons \nfor the new policy.” Id. at 515. \n200.  Agencies must also “provide a more detailed justification than what would suffice \nfor a new policy created on a blank slate … when its prior policy has engendered serious reliance \ninterests that must be taken into account.” Id. \n31 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 32 of 35   PageID 32\n201.  CMS has not provided a sufficiently reasoned analysis for its decision to act and \nimpose minimum staffing requirements when it did not do so for decades and has not provided \ngood reasons for doing so. The Final Rule is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n202.  When an agency’s “prior policy has engendered serious reliance interests that must \nbe taken into account, it would be arbitrary or capricious to ignore such matters.” Fox Television \nStations, 556 U.S. at 515. \n203.   Texas has no minimum long-care facility nursing staffing requirements and has \nserious reliance interests that must be taken into account. CMS’s justification for the Final Rule is \ninsufficient. The Final Rule is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \n204.  “Under the arbitrary-and-capricious standard, [an agency] must show that it has \nreasonably considered the relevant issues and reasonably explained the decision. That requires the \nagency to consider all relevant factors raised by the public comments and provide a response to \nsignificant points within.” U.S. Chamber of Commerce v. U.S. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, 85 F.4th 760, \n774 (5th Cir. 2023) (citation omitted). \n205.  CMS failed to consider Texas’s comment that there are not enough nursing staff in \nTexas for long-term care facilities in Texas and that there are insufficient human resources to \ncomply with the Final Rule and that the Final Rule will put long-term care facilities that cannot \ncomply with the Final Rule out of business, harming residents who lose their homes and future \nresidents who have fewer options. The Final Rule is therefore arbitrary and capricious. \nVI.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT 1 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C): \nIn Excess of Statutory Jurisdiction of Authority \n206.  All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n207.  The Final Rule challenged herein constitutes “agency action” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(13) for purposes of review under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n32 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 33 of 35   PageID 33\n208.  The Final Rule exceeds CMS’s statutory authority and therefore violates the APA, \n5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n209.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be … in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short \nof statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n210.  42  U.S.C.  §§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i)  and  42  U.S.C.  § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I),  (II) \nestablish minimum nurse staffing levels at long-term care facilities. CMS may not impose different \nminimum nurse staffing levels at long-term care facilities. \n211.  42 U.S.C. §§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I), (II) allow \nCMS to waive requirements, not impose more requirements. \n212.  CMS may not read 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(d)(4)(B) and 1395i-3(d)(4)(B), 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1396r(b)(2) and 1395i-3(b)(2), or 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(1)(A) and 1395i-3(b)(1)(A) to authorize \nit to impose minimum nurse staffing levels at long-term care facilities because even if the general \nterms of those statutes could be read to allow such an imposition, the specific terms in 42 U.S.C. \n§§ 1395i-3(b)(4)(C)(i) and 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(b)(4)(C)(i)(I), (II) control. \n213.  Reading  42  U.S.C.  §§ 1396r(d)(4)(B)  and  1395i-3(d)(4)(B),  42  U.S.C. \n§§ 1396r(b)(2) and 1395i-3(b)(2), or 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396r(b)(1)(A) and 1395i-3(b)(1)(A) to authorize \nCMS to impose minimum nurse staffing levels at long-term care facilities, inflicting enormous \ncosts, requiring the hiring of tens of thousands of registered nurses and nurse aids who do not exist, \nand  shutting  down many  long-term  care  facilities, is  a  prohibited  reading  under  the  Major \nQuestions Doctrine. \nCOUNT 2 \nViolation of APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A): \nArbitrary, Capricious, Abuse of Discretion, Not in Accordance with Law \n214.  All foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. \n215.  The Final Rule challenged herein constitutes “agency action” pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 551(13) for purposes of review under the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702. \n33 \n\nCase 2:24-cv-00171-Z   Document 1   Filed 08/14/24    Page 34 of 35   PageID 34\n216.  The Final Rule is arbitrary and capricious and therefore violates the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A). \n217.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, \nand conclusions found to be … arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n218.  The Final Rule is neither reasonable nor reasonably explained. \n219.  The Final Rule is a change in CMS’s previous decades-long position that it should \nnot impose minimum nurse staffing levels. CMS has failed to explain why it made the change now. \n220.  CMS failed to take reliance interests engendered by its previous policy into account. \n221.  CMS did not consider factors raised by the public comments or provide a response \nto significant points raised within. \nVII.  DEMAND FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiff Texas respectfully requests that the Court: \na.  Declare that the 24/7 requirement violates the Administrative Procedure Act because it \nexceeds statutory authority; \nb.
