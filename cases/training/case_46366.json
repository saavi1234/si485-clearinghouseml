Shane A. Vannatta\nREDDINGTON, an individual; JANE \nDOE, an individual; and JOHN DOE, \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING\nan individual,\nORDERAND ORDER \nSETTING PRELIMINARY \nPlaintiffs, \nINJUNCTION HEARING\nvs.\nSTATE OF MONTANA; \nGREGORYGIANFORTE, inhis\nofficial capacity as Governor of\nthe State of Montana; and AUSTIN \nKNUDSEN, in his official capacity \nas Attorney General of the State of \nMontana,\nDefendants.\nPlaintiffs Casey Perkins, Spencer McDonald, Kasandra Reddington, Jane \nDoe, and John Doe (collectively, “Plaintiffs”) move for a temporary restraining \norder to enjoin Defendants the State of Montana, Governor Gregory Gianforte, and \nAttorney General Austin Knudsen (collectively, “Defendants”) from enforcing \nHouse Bill 121 (the “Act”), adopted on March 27, 2025. Plaintiffs allege that the \nAct violates their rights under the Montana Constitution, including the rights to \nequal protection, privacy, to pursue life’s basic necessities, and due process.\nPlaintiffs seek a temporary restraining order until such time as the Court\nconducts ahearing and rules on Plaintiffs’ concurrently filed motion for a\npreliminary injunction. Pursuant to Mont. Code Ann. §§ 27-19-315, 27-19-201(1) \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND\nORDER SETTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING-Page 1of 5\n\nand for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ brief in support, verified complaint, and \nsupporting declarations, the Court concludes a temporary restraining order should\nissue and sets a hearing on Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.\nIn their motion and supporting papers, Plaintiffs have made the requisite \nshowing that they are likely to succeed on, or have at least shown serious questions \ngoing to, the merits of their claims that the Act violates the Montana Constitution. \nSee § 27-19-201(1), MCA; Stensvad v. Newman Ayers Ranch, Inc., 2024 MT 246,\n¶ 23, 418 Mont. 378, 557 P.3d 1240.\nFirst, Plaintiffs have shown at least serious questions going to the merits of \ntheir equal protection claim as follows. See Mont. Const. art. II, § 4. The Act\ndiscriminates on the basis of transgender status, intersex status, and sex. See Cross \nv. State, Cause No. DV-23-541, 2023 WL 6392607, Order Granting Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction at *8–9 (Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., Missoula \nCnty., Sept. 27, 2023), aff’d, Cross by & through Cross v. State, 2024 MT 303, \n560 P.3d 637. Because transgender status is a suspect classification and because \nequal treatment on the basis of sex is a fundamental right, the Act is subject to \nstrict scrutiny. See id. at *9–11 & n.7. The Act fails strict scrutiny because it is \nmotivated by animus and supported by no evidence that its restrictions advance its \npurported purpose to protect women’s safety and privacy. See Powell v. State\nComp. Ins. Fund, 2000 MT 321, ¶ 17, 302 Mont. 518, 15 P.3d 877.\nSecond, Plaintiffs have shown at least serious questions going to the merits \nof their claim that the Act violates their constitutional right to privacy as follows. \nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND\nORDER SETTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING-Page 2of 5\n\nSee Mont. Const. art. II, § 10. Decisions about how to express a person’s gender \nidentity are personal and private, as is information about a person’s transgender or \nintersex status, anatomy, genetics, and medical history. See State v. Nelson (1997), \n283 Mont. 231, 239–41, 941 P.2d 441, 446–48. The Act infringes on these\npersonal and private decisions and information.\nThird, Plaintiffs have shown at least serious questions going to the merits of \ntheir claim that the Act burdens their right to pursue life’s basic necessities as \nfollows. See Mont. Const. art. II, § 3. Access to restrooms and other sex-separated \nfacilities consistent with a person’s gender identity is a basic necessity. See \nWadsworth v. State (1996), 275 Mont. 287, 299, 911 P.2d 1165, 1172. Under the\nAct, however, transgender people cannot use sex-separated facilities that \ncorrespond with their gender identity and intersex people cannot use sex-separated \nfacilities at all.\nFourth, Plaintiffs have at least shown serious questions going to the merits \nof their claim that the Act violates due process by giving intersex people no notice \nof how they can comply with the law as follows. See City of Whitefish v. \nO’Shaughnessy (1985), 216 Mont. 433, 440, 704 P.2d 1021, 1025. Intersex people\ndo not fit in the Act’s restrictive definitions of “female” or “male.” As a result,\nthey do not know whether they are permitted to use any sex-separated facilities at \nall. See State v. Dugan, 2013 MT 38, ¶¶ 66–67, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755;\nEdwards v. State of Montana, Cause No. DV-23-1026, Order on Cross Motions for \nSummary Judgment (Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., Missoula Cnty., Feb. 18, 2025).\nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND\nORDER SETTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING-Page 3of 5\n\nPlaintiffs have also established that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of a temporary restraining order as follows. It is well settled in \nMontana that, “[f]or the purposes of a preliminary injunction, the loss of a \nconstitutional right constitutes an irreparable injury.” Planned Parenthood of \nMontana v. State by & through Knudsen, 2022 MT 157, ¶ 6, 409 Mont. 378, 515 \nP.3d 301 (citation omitted). Plaintiffs are concretely harmed by the Act because it \ndenies them access to restrooms, changing rooms, and sleeping quarters that align \nwith their gender identity.\nPlaintiffs have established the remaining two factors as follows. The\nremaining factors — the balance of the equities and the public interest — merge \ninto one inquiry when the government opposes a temporary restraining order or \npreliminary injunction. Planned Parenthood of Mont. v. State, 2024 MT 228, ¶ 39, \n418 Mont. 253, 557 P.3d 440. The balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor\n“because ‘the government suffers no harm from an injunction that merely ends\nunconstitutional practices.” Id. (quoting Doe v. Kelly, 878 F.3d 710, 718 (9th Cir. \n2017)). And “it is always in the public interest to prevent the violation of a party’s\nconstitutional rights.” Id. (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Here, \ngranting a temporary restraining order will serve the public interest by preserving \nthe status quo until such time as the Court can rule on the application for a \npreliminary injunction.\nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND\nORDER SETTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING-Page 4of 5\n\nORDER\nBased on the foregoing and for the reasons set forth in Plaintiffs’ brief in \nsupport, verified complaint, and accompanying declarations,\nIT IS HEREBY ORDERED that Defendants and their agents, employees,\nrepresentatives, and successors are TEMPORARILY RESTRAINED and\nENJOINED from enforcing the Act, directly or indirectly, until such time as the \nCourt rules on Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Court sets a hearing on Plaintiffs’ \npreliminary injunction motion at 1:00 PM, Monday, April 21, 2025, in District \nCourtroom 1 of the Missoula County Courthouse. The temporary restraining order \nshall not expire after 10 days as provided by Mont. Code Ann. § 27-19-316; the \nCourt finds good cause to extend the length of the temporary restraining order as \nallowed under Mont. Code Ann. § 27-19-317 due to the unavailability of the \nundersigned judge.\nDATED: April 2, 2025, at 10:30 AM, MDT.\nTEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER AND\nElectronically Signed By:\nORDER SETTING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION HEARING-Page 5of 5\nHon.

This action challenges the latest in a relentless series of efforts by the \nState of Montana to demean the personhood of its transgender and intersex citizens \nand banish them to the fringes of society. On March 27, 2025, the State enacted \nHouse Bill 121 (“HB 121” or the “Act”), which bars transgender and intersex \npeople from using restrooms and other sex-separated facilities that correspond to \ntheir gender identity.  \n2.  If allowed to take effect, the Act would make it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for transgender and intersex Montanans to participate in public life—to \nwork, attend school, go to the courthouse or the Motor Vehicle Division, or visit a \nlibrary or state park. And the restrictions imposed by the Act are not limited to \ngovernment buildings. They sweep far more broadly, applying also to buildings \nleased from the government and spaces that provide critical services to the public, \n1 \n\nsuch as domestic violence shelters, warming shelters, interstate rest stops, and even \nhospitals. The Act therefore obstructs transgender and intersex Montanans’ ability \nto seek refuge from domestic abuse and to access healthcare that could be the \ndifference between life and death. \n3.  Transgender people are people whose gender identity—the deeply \nfelt, internal sense of belonging to a particular gender—differs from the sex they \nwere assigned at birth. For example, a transgender man is someone who was \nassigned female at birth but lives as a man. Just as cisgender people, whose gender \nidentity aligns with their birth-assigned sex, cannot simply “turn off” their gender \nidentities, transgender people cannot “turn off” theirs. Indeed, the medical \nconsensus in the United States is that gender identity is innate and that efforts to \nchange a person’s gender identity are not only harmful but also unethical. \n4.  Intersex people are people born with a combination of male and \nfemale sex traits and reproductive anatomy. As a result, they cannot simply be \nsorted into the Act’s narrow categories of “female” or “male.” For intersex people, \nlaws like the Act that attempt to create a binary classification of sex beget \nuncertainty, humiliation, and fear. \n5.  Plaintiffs are transgender and intersex Montanans who seek to live \ntheir lives in safety and dignity. Like other Montanans, Plaintiffs work in public \nbuildings, visit public spaces, and hike in state parks. Like other Montanans, \n2 \n\nPlaintiffs need to use restrooms and other sex-separated facilities when they are in \npublic spaces. But whereas the Act allows cisgender people to use such facilities \nthat correspond to their gender identity, transgender people cannot. And the Act \nexcludes intersex people from these facilities altogether. In singling out \ntransgender and intersex people for discriminatory treatment, the Act demeans \ntheir personhood, relegates them to second-class citizenship, and exposes them to \nheightened risks of harassment and violence. The record lays bare that the Act is \ndriven by animus against transgender people. \n6.  The Montana Constitution does not tolerate the Act’s discrimination \nagainst transgender and intersex Montanans. The Act deprives Plaintiffs of equal \nprotection under the law and unconstitutionally burdens their fundamental rights to \nprivacy and due process, as well as their right to pursue life’s basic necessities. If \nallowed to take effect, the Act would irreparably harm Plaintiffs and other \ntransgender and intersex people. \n7.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs seek a judgment declaring the Act \nunconstitutional and an injunction barring the Act’s enforcement. \n   \n3 \n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n8.  This Court has original jurisdiction over this case under Article VII, \nSection 4, of the Montana Constitution and § 3-5-302, MCA.  \n9.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory relief under the \nMontana Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, see §§ 27-8-201, § 27-8-202, MCA; \nsee also M. R. Civ. P. 57, and the Court’s general legal and equitable powers, \nincluding the Court’s inherent authority to enforce the supremacy of the Montana \nConstitution as against contrary state law, see Mont. Const. art. VII, § 1. \n10.  This Court has jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief under § 27-19-\n101 et seq., MCA, and the Court’s general legal and equitable powers, including \nthe Court’s inherent authority to enforce the supremacy of the Montana \nConstitution as against contrary state law. See Mont. Const. art. VII, § 1. \n11.  Venue is proper in Missoula County under § 25-2-126, MCA, because \none or more Plaintiffs reside there. See § 25-2-126(1), MCA (“In an action against \nthe state brought by a resident of the state, the county of the plaintiff’s residence is \nalso a proper place of trial.”). \nPARTIES \nI.  Plaintiffs \nA.  Casey Perkins \n12.  Plaintiff Casey Perkins is a resident of Helena, Lewis and Clark \nCounty.  \n4 \n\n13.  Casey is a transgender woman. She was assigned the sex designation \nof male at birth but her gender identity is female. She began living and presenting \nas the woman she knows herself to be during the COVID-19 pandemic. Casey \nconsiders her transgender identity to be a personal and private matter. \n14.  Casey works as a license examiner in the Employment Relations \nDivision of the Montana Department of Labor and Industry (“DLI”). DLI is a \npublic agency and a “covered entity” under the Act.  \n15.  In the DLI building where Casey works, there are two multi-\noccupancy, gender-designated restrooms on the fourth floor, where Casey is based. \nThe only single-occupancy restroom in the building is five floors below Casey’s \noffice. \n16.  Casey is acutely aware of the risks she faces as a transgender person \nin public restrooms. She therefore uses the women’s restroom on the fourth floor \nof the office only when the floor is empty, typically early in the morning, or in \nemergencies. Otherwise, Casey does not use the restroom at work. She usually \nworks half days and “holds it” until her shift ends and she can go home to use the \nrestroom.  \n17.  Casey is a single parent and frequently takes her child to Memorial \nPark, a public park in Helena that is a “covered entity” under the Act. The \n5 \n\nrestrooms at Memorial Park are multi-occupancy and separated by gender, and \nCasey uses the women’s restroom. \n18.  Casey would not feel safe using public restrooms if the Act were to \nstay in effect. Compliance with the Act would force Casey to use the men’s \nrestroom at the DLI. Casey would feel demeaned and deeply uncomfortable if she \nwere required to do so. She also fears she could be subjected to harassment and \neven violence in the men’s restroom because using it would “out” her as a \ntransgender person.  \n19.  Casey may not be able to maintain her employment at the DLI or \ncontinue taking her child to public parks if she cannot use restrooms that align with \nher gender identity. \nB.  Spencer McDonald \n20.  Plaintiff Spencer is a resident of Helena, Lewis and Clark County. \n21.  Spencer is a transgender man. He was assigned the sex designation of \nfemale at birth but his gender identity is male. Transitioning saved Spencer’s life. \nBecause he is now living as a man in accordance with his gender identity, he is \nmore outgoing, courageous, determined, and kind. \n22.  Spencer considers his transgender identity to be a personal and private \nmatter. \n6 \n\n23.  Spencer is currently a senior studying pre-law at Carroll College. He \nworks 12 hours per week as a legislative session intern for the Montana \nDemocratic Party.  \n24.  Spencer’s work requires him to be in the Montana State Capitol, \nwhich is a “covered entity” under the Act. \n25.  Spencer’s desk is in the basement of the Capitol building. There are \ntwo single-occupancy, unisex restrooms in the basement. These restrooms are used \nby legislators, staff members, and members of the public, and are typically in high \ndemand.  \n26.  There is one additional set of single-occupancy restrooms in the \nSenate Leadership Offices that are technically public but well known to be \nintended for the use of Republican leadership and staff. Spencer does not feel \ncomfortable using those restrooms. \n27.  The remainder of the public restrooms in the building are multi-\noccupancy and designated by gender. \n28.  When Spencer is at his desk, he uses the single-occupancy restrooms \nin the basement. But because those restrooms are often in use, Spencer also uses \nthe multi-occupancy restrooms designated for men.  \n29.  Spencer’s duties often require him to be present near the House of \nRepresentative’s chamber on the third floor of the Capitol building. The nearest \n7 \n\nrestrooms are multi-occupancy restrooms on the fourth floor. Thus, Spencer \nadditionally uses the men’s restroom on the fourth floor. \n30.  Spencer has not had any problems related to his use of restrooms \ncorresponding to his gender identity in the Capitol building. \n31.  Under the Act, however, Spencer would be required to use women’s \nrestrooms. He would not feel safe doing so because other patrons are likely to \nperceive him as a man, exposing him to harassment and violence. Using women’s \nrestrooms would also “out” Spencer as a transgender man. \n32.  A lifelong Montanan, Spencer often visits and camps in Canyon Ferry \nLake State Park, which is regulated by the Act. The campgrounds at Spencer’s \nfavorite campsite have multi-occupancy, gender-designated restrooms. He would \nnot feel safe or comfortable using the multi-stall restrooms designated for women, \nas the Act requires him to do.  \n33.  The Act makes it very difficult for Spencer to do his job in the Capitol \nbuilding and to spend time in any other public space because it prevents him from \nusing restrooms that align with his gender identity. As a result, if the Act remains \nin effect, Spencer may have no choice but to withdraw from spending time in \nspaces regulated by the Act, including his workplace and the state parks he loves. \n8 \n\nC.  Kasandra Reddington \n34.  Plaintiff Kasandra Reddington, or “Kas,” is a resident of Helena, \nLewis and Clark County. \n35.  Kas is transfeminine: She was assigned the sex designation of male at \nbirth but she identifies as more feminine than masculine, without identifying as a \nspecific gender. Kas values her privacy concerning her transgender identity. \n36.  Kas works at Helena College as its Accessibility Services \nCoordinator, working to provide disability accommodations for students. She is \nalso an advisor with the College’s TRIO program, where she works with \ndisadvantaged students to connect them with services. \n37.  Helena College is a public community college that is part of the \nMontana University System. It is a “covered entity” under the Act because its \nbuildings are “public building[s]” as defined in the Act. \n38.  At Helena College’s Donaldson Campus, Kas uses the restrooms \nclosest to her office, which are multi-occupancy and designated by gender. Those \nrestrooms are used by employees, students, and members of the public. \n39.  Kas uses the women’s restroom as it aligns with her gender identity. \nDoing so allows Kas to attend to her personal needs safely, with dignity, and with \nprivacy.  \n9 \n\n40.  Although Kas’s office building also has one single-occupancy \nrestroom, it is farther from her office than the multi-occupancy restrooms. And \nbecause of a medical issue, Kas often must use the restroom urgently and may not \nbe able to reach the single-occupancy restroom in time when she needs it. \n41.  Kas is occasionally required to travel for work. Approximately once a \nmonth, she visits Helena College’s Airport campus, which has only multi-\noccupancy, gender-designated restrooms.  \n42.  Kas also has work duties on the University of Montana–Missoula \ncampus, which is a “covered entity” under the Act. The only restrooms Kas can \nuse on that campus are multi-occupancy and gender-designated. \n43.  Kas uses the women’s restrooms on Helena College’s Airport campus \nand the University of Montana–Missoula campus. \n44.  Kas has not had any problems related to her use of women’s \nrestrooms at work. \n45.  Outside of work, Kas enjoys spending time in Montana’s state parks. \nHer favorite park is Spring Meadow Lake State Park in Helena, which she visits \nseveral times each month. \n46.  There are multi-occupancy, gender-designated restrooms at Spring \nMeadow Lake State Park. Those restrooms are “covered entities” under the Act. \n10 \n\n47.  Kas uses the women’s restrooms at Spring Meadow Lake State Park \nand has not had an issue using those restrooms. \n48.  Kas has been harassed, discriminated against, and threatened both \nonline and in person because she is transgender. For example, she has been denied \njobs and healthcare access. She has also lost relationships with family members \nand friends because they did not accept her transgender identity. \n49.  Early in her transition, Kas still sometimes used the men’s restroom. \nWhen she did, she was confronted by others and asked to use the women’s \nrestroom.  \n50.  Because of her experiences with harassment, discrimination, and \nthreats, Kas minimizes her use of public restrooms and tries to keep her head down \nwhenever she needs to use them. \n51.  The Act forces Kas into a Hobson’s choice. It requires her to use \nmen’s restrooms, which do not align with her gender identity. If she were to use \nmen’s restrooms, Kas would face intrusive questioning and harassment and \npotentially violence. She would also be “outed” as a transgender woman. She \nwould not feel safe or comfortable using men’s restrooms.  \n52.  But if Kas were to use women’s restrooms, she would be breaking the \nlaw and putting the workplace she loves at risk, because Helena College could be \n11 \n\nsued under the Act by anyone who is in a women’s restroom at the same time as \nKas. Kas does not want to jeopardize the College’s ability to serve its students. \n53.  Put in this untenable position, Kas may not be able to continue \nworking at Helena College, visiting state parks, or spending time in any of the \nother spaces regulated by the Act.   \nD.  Jane Doe1 \n54.  Plaintiff Jane Doe is a resident of Helena, Lewis and Clark County.  \n55.  Jane is a transgender woman. She was assigned the sex designation of \nmale at birth but identifies as a woman. Jane transitioned and began living as the \nwoman she knew herself to be approximately three years ago. She has been \nworking with medical professionals to bring her physical appearance and \npresentation into alignment with her gender identity. \n56.  Jane considers her transgender identity to be a personal and private \nmatter. \n57.  Jane is a graphic designer in the Montana State Print and Mail \nDepartment. She works in a warehouse building, which is a “public building” \nregulated by the Act. The warehouse is split between a shop floor and an office. \nJane’s cubicle is in the office portion of the building,  \n \n1 Two plaintiffs seek to proceed under pseudonym in this case as “Jane Doe” \nand “John Doe.” Their motion for leave for proceed under pseudonym is \nforthcoming. \n12 \n\n58.  The only bathrooms in the office portion of the warehouse building \nare designated by gender: two single-occupancy restrooms upstairs and multi-\noccupancy restrooms downstairs. The is one unisex bathroom on the shop floor. \n59.  Jane uses the women’s single-occupancy and multi-occupancy \nrestrooms because they align with her gender identity. She does not use the unisex \nbathroom on the shop floor because it is in high demand and often occupied, and \nbecause it is significantly farther from her office than the gender-designated \nbathrooms.  \n60.  Jane has never had any problems related to her use of restrooms at \nwork that align with her gender identity. \n61.  In her free time, Jane enjoys visiting parks operated by the State of \nMontana or by municipalities, which are all regulated by the Act. Jane uses the \nwomen’s restrooms at these public parks and has never had any issues doing so. \n62.  It would not only be humiliating but also dangerous for Jane to use \nmen’s restrooms, as the Act requires her to do. Doing so would “out” Jane as \ntransgender to any stranger who sees her in the restroom and dramatically increase \nthe risk that she will be harassed and attacked.  \n63.  If Jane were to continue using women’s restrooms, however, she \nwould be violating the Act, opening her employer up to liability and jeopardizing \nher own employment.  \n13 \n\n64.  Jane cannot avoid using the restroom for an entire workday. Because \nof the Act, she may not be able to continue working in the State Print and Mail \nDepartment. \nE.  John Doe \n65.  Plaintiff John Doe is a resident of Missoula, Missoula County.  \n66.  John is intersex. He was assigned the sex designation of male at birth \nbut has sex traits and reproductive anatomy corresponding to both the male gender \nand the female gender. For example, John has two X chromosomes and no Y \nchromosome, which would classify him as female. However, he also has the SRY \nprotein, which is typically located on a Y chromosome and directs the development \nof sexual characteristics. John also has both male genitalia and breast tissue.  \n67.  To John, his intersex status and gender identity are private and \npersonal.  \n68.  John regularly visits the local public library for an ongoing gaming \ngroup. As part of that group, he plays social deduction and board games with \nfriends and members of the public.  \n69.  The public library is a “covered entity” under the Act. It has multi-\noccupancy, gender-designated restrooms and John uses the men’s restrooms \nbecause he identifies as male. \n14 \n\n70.  John also frequents the University of Montana campus to attend \nevents and concerts, watch plays and movies, and visit the campus bookstore.  \n71.  The University is a “covered entity” under the Act because its \nbuildings are “public building[s]” as defined in the Act. The University has multi-\noccupancy, gender-designated restrooms and John uses the men’s restrooms. \n72.  John and his spouse also like to visit Splash Montana, a water park \nowned and operated by the City of Missoula. Splash Montana is a “covered entity” \nunder the Act. \n73.  At Splash Montana, John uses the men’s changing room as that \ncorresponds to his gender identity. \n74.  John has not encountered any problems when using public facilities \nthat correspond to his gender identity. \n75.  But John is not sure whether he would be classified as “male” or \n“female” under the Act. There are a variety of ways in which intersex people’s sex \ntraits and reproductive anatomy—including external genitalia, internal \nreproductive organs, chromosomes, and/or hormone production and response—can \ndiffer from the Act’s narrow, binary definitions of “male” and “female.” Thus, \nintersex people like John do not fit within the Act’s restrictive definitions of “sex,” \n“male,” and “female.”  \n15 \n\n76.  As a result, John does not know what restrooms and changing rooms \nhe should use at the library, the University, Splash Montana, and other spaces \ngoverned by the Act.  \n77.  If John were to continue using men’s restrooms, he may be deemed to \nbe using the incorrect facilities under the Act because he is not “male” under the \nAct’s definition, subjecting him to harassment and the covered entity to legal \nliability. If the covered entity is sued because another individual perceives John to \nbe using the incorrect restroom, as part of the lawsuit John may be compelled to \npublicly disclose deeply personal details about his intersex status, medical history, \nbiological traits, and gender identity. \n78.  If John were to use women’s restrooms, he may likewise be deemed \nto be using the incorrect facilities under the Act because he is also not “female” \nunder the Act’s definition. Moreover, other patrons may perceive him to be a man \nand subject him to harassment and violence and the covered entity to legal liability. \n79.  John does not want to avoid using public spaces altogether or forego \nusing restrooms while in public spaces. But, because he does not know how he can \ncomply with the Act, he worries he may have to take those drastic measures for his \nown safety. \n16 \n\nII.  Defendants \n80.  The State of Montana is a government entity subject to and bound by \nthe Constitution and laws of the State of Montana. Under Article II, Section 18 of \nthe Montana Constitution, the State is subject to suit for injuries to persons. \n81.  Governor Gianforte is the elected Governor of the State of Montana. \nHe is the State’s principal executive officer and is responsible for administering \nMontana’s laws. \n82.  Attorney General Knudsen is the Attorney General of the State of \nMontana. He is the State’s principal law enforcement officer and is authorized by \nthe Public Health Laws to enforce the Act. See § 50-1-103(2), MCA. He is sued in \nhis official capacity. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nI.  Gender Identity, Gender Dysphoria, and Intersex Identity \n83.  A person’s gender identity is their deeply felt, internal sense of \nbelonging to a particular gender, which can differ from the sex they were assigned \nat birth. Every person has a gender identity. \n84.  Transgender people have a gender identity that differs from the sex \nthey were assigned at birth. For example, a transgender man is someone who was \nassigned a female sex at birth but persistently, consistently, and insistently \nidentifies as male. \n17 \n\n85.  Cisgender people have a gender identity that aligns with their birth-\nassigned sex. \n86.  Just as cisgender people cannot (and are not expected or asked to) \n“turn off” their gender identities like a switch, so too are transgender people unable \nto “turn off” their gender identities. \n87.  The medical consensus in the United States, agreed upon by the \nAmerican College of Physicians, the American Psychiatric Association, and other \nmajor medical organizations, is that gender identity is innate and that efforts to \nchange a person’s gender identity are harmful to their health and well-being and \nunethical. \n88.  The incongruence between a person’s gender identity and their birth-\nassigned sex can cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning \nknown as gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a serious medical condition. \n89.  Being transgender is not in and of itself a medical condition to be \ncured. As the American Psychiatric Association has explained, “[t]he presence of \ngender variance is not the pathology”; rather, gender dysphoria results “from the \ndistress caused by the body and mind not aligning and/or societal marginalization \nof gender-variant people.” \n18 \n\n90.  Untreated, gender dysphoria can result in significant lifelong distress, \nclinically significant anxiety and depression, self-harming behaviors, substance \nmisuse, and suicidality. \n91.  The recognized standard of care for gender dysphoria is to eliminate \nthe clinically significant distress a patient is experiencing by bringing their body \nand gender expression into alignment with their gender identity. An aspect of this \ntreatment is “social transition,” which is the process through which transgender \npeople live and become socially recognized in accordance with their gender \nidentity. Social transition includes allowing transgender people to dress and use \nnames, restrooms, and other sex-separated facilities consistent with their gender \nidentity. \n92.  Intersex people are born with sex traits and reproductive anatomy that \ndo not fit into the narrow binary categories of “female” or “male.” For example, \nsome intersex people have both ovarian and testicular tissue. Other intersex people \nhave combinations of chromosomes, such as XXY, that are different than XY, \nwhich is usually associated with the male category, and XX, which is usually \nassociated with the female category. \n93.  Being intersex is not a disorder or disease; it is a naturally occurring \nvariation in humans and typically does not require any medical treatment or care. \nApproximately 1–2% of people have intersex traits. \n19 \n\n94.  Although doctors may assign intersex babies a legal sex of “female” \nor “male,” that individual’s gender identity may not align with their birth-assigned \nsex. \nII.  The Act \n95.  On March 27, 2025, Governor Gianforte signed the Act into law after \nthe Legislature passed it. HB 121, 2025 Leg., 69th Sess. (Mont. 2025). The Act \ntook immediate effect. \n96.  The Act bars transgender people from using public restrooms, \nchanging rooms, and sleeping quarters that correspond to their gender identity. It \ndictates: “A covered entity shall designate each multi-occupancy restroom, \nchanging room, or sleeping quarters for the exclusive use of females or males” HB \n121 § 3(1). These facilities “may be used only by members of that sex.” HB 121 \n§ 3(2).  \n97.  The Act narrowly defines “female” and “male” in terms of physiology \nand genetics identified at birth: “In human beings, there are exactly two sexes, \nmale and female, with two corresponding types of gametes. The sexes are \ndetermined by the biological and genetic indication of male or female, including \nsex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex chromosomes, gonads, and \nnonambiguous internal and external genitalia present at birth.” HB 121 § 2(12). \nAccordingly, the Act defines “female” and “male” in terms of a person’s “XX” or \n20 \n\n“XY chromosomes” and the type of “gametes” the person’s “reproductive and \nendocrine system” produces. HB 121 § 2(4), 2(7). These definitions expressly \ndisregard “an individual’s psychological, behavioral, social, chosen, or subjective \nexperience of gender.” HB 121 § 2(12). \n98.  The Act’s restrictions apply to a wide range of covered entities, \nincluding public buildings and spaces that provide important services to the public: \n“‘Covered entity’ means a correctional center, a juvenile detention facility, a local \ndomestic violence program, a public building, or a public school.” HB 121 § 2(3). \nA “public building,” in turn, includes any “building that is owned or leased by a \npublic agency . . . and that is open to the public, including but not limited to . . . a \nbuilding that is used for educational, office, or institutional purposes; or a library, \nmuseum, school, hospital, auditorium, dormitory, or university building.” HB 121 \n§ 2(9).  \n99.  The Act subjects covered entities to private lawsuits for non-\ncompliance with its restrictions. It provides that any “individual who, while \naccessing a restroom or changing room designated for use by the individual’s sex, \nencounters another individual of the opposite sex in the restroom or changing room \nhas a private cause of action  . . . against the covered entity that: (a) provided the \nother individual permission to use a restroom or changing room designated for the \nopposite sex; or (b) failed to take reasonable steps to prohibit the other individual \n21 \n\nfrom using the restroom or changing room designated for the opposite sex.” HB \n121 § 4(1). Similarly, any “individual who is required by a covered entity to share \nsleeping quarters with an individual of the opposite sex has a private cause of \naction” against the covered entity. HB 121 § 4(2).  \n100.  The Act allows individuals to sue allegedly non-compliant covered \nentities “for declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal damages,” “attorney fees \nand costs,” and “any other appropriate relief.” HB 121 § 4(1), (2), (3)(b). \nIII.  The Animus Motivating the Act \n101.  The Act’s purported justification for excluding transgender and \nintersex people from accessing public facilities that correspond to their gender \nidentity is to protect women “from acts of abuse, harassment, sexual assault, and \nviolence committed by men.” HB 121 § 1(2). \n102.  But the legislative record contains no evidence that barring \ntransgender and intersex people from using sex-separated facilities corresponding \nto their gender identity would benefit women’s safety or privacy. There is no \nevidence of privacy or safety offenses occurring in public restrooms, changing \nrooms, or sleeping quarters in Montana. Nor is there evidence that transgender or \nintersex people have a predisposition toward such offenses.  \n103.  To the contrary, the evidence makes clear that allowing transgender \nand intersex people to use sex-separated facilities consistent with their gender \n22 \n\nidentity harms no one. As of 2019, twenty-one states, the District of Columbia, and \nmore than 200 cities and counties had enacted laws permitting transgender people \nto access sex-separated facilities that accord with their gender identity. This \nwidespread adoption of anti-discrimination laws has not resulted in sexual assaults \nor violence in public bathrooms. An empirical survey found no evidence that \nprivacy and safety in public restrooms changed because of the passage of \nordinances proscribing discrimination on the basis of gender identity in public \naccommodations. \n104.   In fact, it is transgender and intersex people who are most vulnerable \nto harassment and violence in sex-separated spaces such as restrooms. Surveys \nhave shown that transgender Americans are verbally harassed and physically \nattacked in public restrooms at much higher rates than cisgender people.  \n105.  It is particularly uncomfortable—and often dangerous—for \ntransgender and intersex people to have to use sex-separated facilities that do not \ncorrespond to their gender identity. Many transgender and intersex people avoid \nusing public restrooms for fear of being harassed and attacked. Some fast or \ndehydrate to stave off, for as long as possible, having to use public restrooms, and \nsuch drastic measures can lead to health complications. If they do not have the \noption of using public restrooms that correspond to their gender identity, many \n23 \n\ntransgender and intersex people are forced to avoid being in public spaces \naltogether. \n106.  Statements made by the Act’s proponents reveal that it is motivated \nby animus against transgender people rather than any legitimate concern for public \nsafety or privacy. During the legislative process, those proponents repeatedly \ndenigrated transgender people, expressing the view that their gender identities \nshould not be respected and that the mere presence of transgender people poses a \nthreat to cisgender people.  \n107.  Representative Kerri Seekins-Crowe, the sponsor of the Act, said: \n“Men do not belong in women[’s] spaces, and ignoring the biological differences \ncreates real victims and jeopardizes the dignity and safety of girls.” Attempting to \njustify the Act, she insisted that “[w]omen should not have to sacrifice their \nprivacy or their safety because of political agendas or cultural trends.”  \n108.  Similarly, Lieutenant Governor Kristen Juras testified that \n“[a]cknowledging biological realities should not be complicated or controversial,” \nand touted the Act as part of the Legislature and the Governor’s “shared record of \ndefending Montanans from the far left’s ideological crusade that has swept the \nnation.” \n24 \n\n109.  The Act itself erases official recognition of transgender and intersex \nidentities by defining sex to exclude “an individual’s psychological, behavioral, \nsocial, chosen, or subjective experience of gender.” HB 121 § 2(12). \n110.  Lieutenant Governor Juras drew an explicit connection between the \nAct and several other recent pieces of legislation discriminating against the \ntransgender community: 2023’s Senate Bill 99 (“SB 99”), which prohibited \ngender-affirming medical care for transgender youth; Senate Bill 458 (“SB 458”), \nalso from 2023, which required Montanans to be classified by “exactly two sexes, \nmale and female,” as defined by their reproductive capabilities; and 2021’s House \nBill 112 (“HB 112”), which barred transgender girls from competing in girls’ \nsports. Montana courts have found each of these laws to be unconstitutional or \nlikely unconstitutional. \n111.  Notably, a court permanently enjoined as unconstitutional SB 458, \nwhich imposed definitions of “sex,” “male,” and “female” that are identical to \nthose in the Act. The court determined that SB 458 violated the Montana \nConstitution’s guarantees of equal protection and individual privacy. See Edwards \nv. State of Montana, Cause No. DV-23-1026, Order on Cross Motions for \nSummary Judgment (Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., Missoula Cnty., Feb. 18, 2025). \n112.  In addition, in December 2024, a Montana district court preliminarily \nenjoined as likely unconstitutional both a Montana Administrative Rule preventing \n25 \n\nthe Department of Public Health and Human Services from amending birth \ncertificates to reflect gender transitions and a related Montana Motor Vehicle \nDivision policy prohibiting amendment of driver’s licenses to reflect the holder’s \ngender identity unless the holder provides an amended birth certificate. See \nKalarchik v. State, Cause No. ADV-2024-261, Order Granting Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor Preliminary Injunction (Mont. First Jud. Dist. Ct., Lewis and Clark Cnty., Dec. \n16, 2024). \n113.  Like every other law enacted as part of this relentless offensive \nagainst the transgender community, the Act seeks to undermine transgender \nMontanans’ personhood and ability to participate in public life. And the Act’s \nrestrictive definitions of “female” and “male” exclude intersex individuals entirely, \nalso undermining their personhood and ability to participate in public life. \n114.  Because urination, bowel movements, menstrual hygiene, and sleep \nare not optional, people cannot stay for long in spaces where they cannot use the \nrestroom or have no place to sleep. Notably, people who cannot access the \nrestroom where they work or attend school will not be able to continue their \nemployment or education.  \n115.  By restricting transgender and intersex people’s access to restrooms, \nchanging rooms, and sleeping quarters, the Act—if allowed to take effect—\n26 \n\nattempts to condemn this vulnerable community of Montanans to become second-\nclass citizens relegated to the fringes of society. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I: Equal Protection (Mont. Const. art. II, § 4) \n(On behalf of all Plaintiffs) \n116.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference all allegations made in the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n117.  Article II, Section 4 of the Montana Constitution states: “The dignity \nof the human being is inviolable. No person shall be denied the equal protection of \nthe laws. Neither the state nor any person, firm, corporation, or institution shall \ndiscriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on \naccount of race, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or \nreligious ideas.” Mont. Const. art. II, § 4. \n118.  Montana’s Equal Protection Clause “provides even more individual \nprotection than does the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.” Planned \nParenthood of Montana v. State, 2024 MT 228, ¶ 29, 418 Mont. 253, 557 P.3d 440 \n(quoting A.J.B. v. Mont. Eighteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., 2023 MT 7, ¶ 24, 411 Mont. \n201, 523 P.3d 519). In addition, Article II, Section 4 enshrines a recognition of \nindividual dignity that “[t]he federal constitution does not expressly provide.” \nWalker v. State, 2003 MT 134, ¶ 73, 316 Mont. 103, 68 P.3d 872. \n27 \n\n119.  In violation of equal protection, the Act facially discriminates against \nPlaintiffs and other transgender and intersex Montanans on the basis of both \ntransgender status and sex.  \n120.  The Act discriminates against transgender people because it permits \ncisgender people to use covered facilities that correspond to their gender identity \nwhile barring transgender people from doing the same.  \n121.  The Act discriminates against intersex people because it permits \npeople who fit in the Act’s definitions of “female” and “male” to use covered \nfacilities while barring intersex people from doing the same. Indeed, “[b]y \ndeclaring as a matter of law that human beings can only be ‘exactly’ one of the two \nsexes, [the Act] explicitly excludes [intersex people] from the definition of human \nbeings, causing immediate harm . . . .” Edwards, Cause No. DV-23-1026, at 11. \n122.  The Act discriminates on the basis of sex because a person’s ability to \nuse a covered facility that corresponds to their gender identity turns on whether \nthey fit into the Act’s definition of “female and “male.” In fact, “it is impossible to \ndiscriminate against a person for being . . . transgender without discriminating \nagainst that individual based on sex.” Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., 590 U.S. 644, 660 \n(2020). It is likewise impossible to discriminate against a person for being intersex \nwithout discriminating against them based on sex. \n28 \n\n123.  Governmental discrimination against transgender people is subject to \nstrict scrutiny because transgender status is a suspect classification. See Cross v. \nState, Cause No. DV-23-541, 2023 WL 6392607, Order Granting Plaintiffs’ \nMotion for Preliminary Injunction at *10 n.7 (Mont. Fourth Jud. Dist. Ct., \nMissoula Cnty., Sept. 27, 2023) (“[T]he Court believes that transgender persons \ncomprise a suspect class . . . .”); see also Cross by & through Cross v. State, 2024 \nMT 303, ¶ 62, 560 P.3d 637 (McKinnon, J., concurring) (reasoning that “[s]trict \nscrutiny is undoubtedly the appropriate tier of scrutiny” for classifications based on \ntransgender status). \n124.  In Montana and across the country, transgender people have been \nhistorically and purposefully subjected to unequal treatment for being \ntransgender—a characteristic that bears no relation to their ability to perform in or \ncontribute to society.  \n125.  Even now, transgender people face discrimination, harassment, and \nviolence at school, in the workplace, and in many other aspects of life. In Montana, \nthe Legislature and executive branch have repeatedly enacted laws targeting \ntransgender people. See Factual Allegations III, supra. At the national level, \nPresident Trump issued a flurry of executive orders within the first ten days of his \ncurrent term targeting transgender people. These executive orders pronounce it \n“the policy of the United States to recognize two sexes, male and female,” as \n29 \n\n“immutable biological reality” and effectively command the federal government to \ndeny the existence of transgender people; prohibit the federal government from \n“fund[ing], sponsor[ing], promot[ing], assist[ing], or support[ing]” gender-\naffirming medical treatment for transgender youth; and ban transgender people \nfrom serving in the military. Exec. Order No. 14168, 90 FR 8615, §§ 1–2 (Jan. 20, \n2025); Exec. Order No. 14187, 90 FR 8771, § 1 (Jan. 28, 2025); Exec. Order No. \n14183, 90 FR 8757, § 1 (Jan. 27, 2025). \n126.  Moreover, transgender people suffer a level of political powerlessness \nthat warrants heightened protection under the law because of the community’s \nsmall population and the barriers it faces to political representation.  \n127.  The transgender community also suffers from significantly higher \nrates of employment discrimination, economic instability, and homelessness than \nthe general U.S. population. \n128.  Governmental discrimination based on sex is likewise subject to strict \nscrutiny. Any right guaranteed by the Montana Constitution’s Declaration of \nRights is a fundamental right that triggers strict scrutiny. See Montana Env’t Info. \nCtr. v. Dep’t of Env’t Quality, 1999 MT 248, ¶ 63, 296 Mont. 207, 988 P.2d 1236. \nAnd the Declaration of Rights expressly provides that the state shall not \n“discriminate against any person in the exercise of his civil or political rights on \naccount of . . . sex.” Mont. Const. art. II, § 4; see, e.g., Kalarchik, Cause No. ADV-\n30 \n\n2024-261, at 10–11 (“Article II, Section 4 . . . establishes a fundamental right” to \nbe free from discrimination “on account of . . . sex.” (emphasis in original)).  \n129.  Laws subject to strict scrutiny must be narrowly tailored to advance a \ncompelling state interest. Indeed, to satisfy strict scrutiny, a law must represent \n“the least onerous path that can be taken to achieve the state objective.” Montana \nEnv’t Info. Ctr., ¶ 61.   \n130.  The Act cannot survive strict scrutiny, or even rational-basis review, \nbecause it is motivated by bare animus against transgender people and is not \nrationally related to the furtherance of any legitimate state interest, let alone \nnarrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest. \n131.  The Act is not even rationally related to its stated goal of \n“reaffirm[ing] the longstanding meanings of the terms ‘sex’, ‘male’, and ‘female,’” \nHB121 § 1, because it defines these terms in a manner that is not scientifically \naccurate. \n132.  As evidenced by the repeated statements of its proponents denigrating \ntransgender people and its express disregard for “an individual’s psychological, \nbehavioral, social, chosen, or subjective experience of gender,” HB 121 § 2(12), \nthe Act intentionally singles out transgender people for disfavored treatment. \n133.  The animus behind the Act is especially offensive to the Montana \nConstitution because “[t]he plain meaning of the dignity clause commands that the \n31 \n\nintrinsic worth and the basic humanity of persons may not be violated.” Walker, \n¶ 82. \n134.  Far from substantiating the Legislature’s claim that the Act advances \nwomen’s safety and privacy, the evidence shows that allowing transgender and \nintersex people to use public facilities consistent with their gender identity poses \nno threat to cisgender people. Preventing transgender and intersex people from \nusing facilities that correspond to their gender identity, however, exposes them to \nincreased risks of harassment and violence and renders it difficult, if not \nimpossible, for them to participate fully in public life. \n135.  The Legislature has offered no evidence of privacy or safety offenses \noccurring in public restrooms, changing rooms, or sleeping quarters in Montana, \nand no evidence that transgender or intersex people have a predisposition toward \nsuch offenses. \n136.  Even setting aside that there is no evidence of such offenses occurring \nin Montana, the Act is not the least onerous path to advancing the Legislature’s \npurported interest in protecting women’s safety and privacy. Montana already has \nrobust laws criminalizing abuse, sexual assault, and violence. And simple measures \nsuch as installing enclosed restroom stalls and urinal dividers are a less onerous \nway to preserve privacy than excluding transgender people from public facilities \naltogether. \n32 \n\nCOUNT II: Privacy (Mont. Const. art. II, § 10) \n(On behalf of all Plaintiffs) \n137.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference all allegations made in the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n138.  Article II, Section 10 of the Montana Constitution provides: “The \nright of individual privacy is essential to the well-being of a free society and shall \nnot be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.” Mont. Const. \nart. II, § 10.  \n139.  “That the right to privacy is separately protected in the Montana \nConstitution ‘reflects Montanans’ historical abhorrence and distrust of excessive \ngovernmental interference in their personal lives.’” Cross, ¶ 22 (quoting Gryczan \nv. State (1997), 283 Mont. 433, 455, 942 P.2d 112, 125). That is why “Montana \nadheres to one of the most stringent protections of its citizens’ right to privacy in \nthe United States”—protections “significantly broader” than those afforded by the \nU.S. Constitution. Armstrong v. State, 1999 MT 261, ¶¶ 34, 41, 296 Mont. 361, \n989 P.2d 364.  \n140.  Article II, Section 10 safeguards both “autonomy privacy,” which \nprotects Montanans’ interest in “making intimate personal decisions or conducting \npersonal activities without observation, intrusion, or interference”; and \n“informational privacy,” which protects Montanans’ interest in “precluding the \n33 \n\ndissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information.” State v. Nelson \n(1997), 283 Mont. 231, 241, 941 P.2d 441, 448 (citation omitted). \n141.  Decisions about where and when to use restrooms and other facilities \nto perform necessary bodily functions, dress and undress, and sleep are personal \nand intimate. Montanans reasonably expect to be able to make such decisions \nwithout the State’s intrusion or interference. Thus, each Plaintiff has an actual and \nreasonable expectation of autonomy privacy in their decision to use restrooms, \nchanging rooms, and sleeping quarters that correspond with their gender identity. \nBut the Act commands the State’s interference in those decisions. \n142.  Information about a person’s gender identity, anatomy, genetic code, \nand medical history is sensitive and confidential. Each Plaintiff thus has an actual \nand reasonable expectation of informational privacy in such personal details. See \nMarquez v. State, Cause No. DV 21-873, 2022 WL 4486283, at *5 (Mont. \nThirteenth Jud. Dist. Ct., Yellowstone Cnty., Apr. 21, 2022) (finding that a \n“person’s transgender identity” is “a profoundly private piece of information in \nwhich a transgender person has a reasonable expectation of privacy”). But by \nrequiring transgender people to use sex-separated facilities inconsistent with their \ngender identity, the Act “outs” them, publicly revealing their transgender identity \nwithout their choosing to do so. \n34 \n\n143.  The Act also requires covered entities to regulate access to sex-\nseparated facilities based on a person’s “sex chromosomes, naturally occurring sex \nchromosomes, gonads, and . . . genitalia present at birth.” HB 121 § 2(12). The Act \ntherefore entails inquiries into and the public disclosure of Plaintiffs’ transgender \nor intersex identity, anatomy, genetic code, and medical history. \n144.  Moreover, whenever an individual sues a covered entity for \n“encounter[ing] another individual of the opposite sex in the [entity’s] restroom or \nchanging room,” HB 121 § 4(1), the Act makes the second individual’s gender \nidentity and birth-assigned sex an element of the legal violation. Thus, the Act \nopens transgender people up to subpoena and testimony about their gender \nidentity, anatomy, genetic code, and medical history in public proceedings. \n145.  Because the right to privacy is a fundamental right enshrined in the \nMontana Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, any legislation infringing on the \nright is subject to strict scrutiny. See Cross, ¶ 22.  \n146.  As detailed above, the Act fails strict scrutiny because it is not \nnarrowly tailored to advance any compelling state interest, and it could not, in any \nevent, satisfy even rational-basis review.  \n   \n35 \n\nCOUNT III: Right to Pursue Life’s Basic Necessities  \n(Mont. Const. art. II, § 3) \n(On behalf of all Plaintiffs) \n147.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference all allegations made in the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n148.  Article II, Section 3 of the Montana Constitution guarantees: “All \npersons are born free and have certain inalienable rights. They include the right to \na clean and healthful environment and the rights of pursuing life’s basic \nnecessities, enjoying and defending their lives and liberties, acquiring, possessing \nand protecting property, and seeking their safety, health and happiness in all lawful \nways.” Mont. Const. art. II, § 3.  \n149.  Urination, bowel movements, menstrual hygiene, and sleep are not \noptional. Therefore, safe, unrestricted access to restrooms, changing rooms, and \nsleeping quarters where people can perform these basic functions is a necessity of \nlife.  \n150.  The Act denies transgender and intersex people such access. Instead, \nthe Act forces transgender Montanans into the Hobson’s choice between using sex-\nseparated facilities inconsistent with their gender identity—an uncomfortable, \nhumiliating, and often dangerous prospect—and avoiding public spaces altogether. \n151.  Under the Act, Plaintiffs would not be able to maintain their \nemployment in public buildings, continue their education in public schools or \n36 \n\nuniversities, or engage in the countless professional and personal activities that \npeople pursue in public spaces. See Wadsworth v. State (1996), 275 Mont. 287, \n299, 911 P.2d 1165, 1172 (explaining that “without the right to the opportunity to \npursue employment, the right to pursue life’s basic necessities would have little \nmeaning”). \n152.  The Act applies even in hospital settings, compromising transgender \nMontanans’ access to healthcare that could be the difference between life and \ndeath. \n153.  Because the right to pursue life’s basic necessities is a fundamental \nright enshrined in the Montana Constitution’s Declaration of Rights, any \nlegislation infringing on that right is subject to strict scrutiny. See Wadsworth, 275 \nMont. at 299, 911 P.2d at 1172. \n154.  As detailed above, the Act fails strict scrutiny because it is not \nnarrowly tailored to advance any compelling state interest, and it could not, in any \nevent, satisfy even rational-basis review.  \nCOUNT IV: Due Process (Mont. Const. art. II, § 17) \n(On behalf of Plaintiff John Doe) \n155.  Plaintiffs incorporate herein by reference all allegations made in the \npreceding paragraphs of this Complaint.  \n37 \n\n156.  Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution provides: “No \nperson shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.” \nMont. Const. art. II, § 17. The Due Process Clause requires that “[a] statute must \nbe drawn with sufficient clarity and definiteness to inform persons of ordinary \nintelligence what actions are proscribed.” City of Whitefish v. O’Shaughnessy \n(1985), 216 Mont. 433, 440, 704 P.2d 1021, 1025. Statutes that lack the requisite \nclarity are void for vagueness. Id. \n157.  “A statute is void on its face if it fails to give a person of ordinary \nintelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.” State v. Dugan, \n2013 MT 38, ¶ 67, 369 Mont. 39, 303 P.3d 755 (citation and internal quotation \nmarks omitted). A statute is vague as applied if it fails to “provide[] a person with \nactual notice” or “minimal guidelines to law enforcement.” Id. (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).  \n158.  The Act is unconstitutionally vague both on its face and as applied \nwith respect to intersex people because it excludes intersex people in its \nscientifically inaccurate definitions of “sex,” “female,” and “male.” See Edwards, \nCause No. DV-23-1026, at 11. As a result, intersex people—including Plaintiff \nJohn Doe—do not have fair or actual notice about whether the Act classifies them \nas male or female, and do not know which sex-separated facilities (if any) they are \n38 \n\npermitted to use. They are subject to standardless and arbitrary decisionmaking by \nwhatever entities are enforcing the Act. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court: \nA. Declare the Act unlawful and unconstitutional on its face and as\napplied for the reasons set forth above;\nB. Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants, as well as their\nagents, officers, employees, representatives, successors, and any other\npersons who are in active concert or participation with them from\nmaintaining in force, enforcing, or giving legal effect to the Act,\ndirectly or indirectly;\nC. Award Plaintiffs the reasonable attorney’s fees and costs incurred in\nbringing this action; and\nD.
