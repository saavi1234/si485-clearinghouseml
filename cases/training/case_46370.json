On April 2, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an Expedited Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (DE 4) (\"Motion\"). In the Motion, Plaintiffs request the Court grant a temporary restraining order preventing enforcement of Florida law S.B. 4-C pending consideration of Plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. (DE 4 at 1, 20.) A court may not grant a temporary restraining order without notice to the adverse party unless \"the movant's attorney certifies in writing any efforts made to give notice and the reasons why it should not be required.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1)(B). Further, Southern District of Florida Local Rule 7.1(d)(2) requires that an expedited motion \"set forth in detail the date by which an expedited ruling is needed and the reason the ruling is needed by the stated date.\" Plaintiffs have not filed proof of service of any Defendants, and the Motion does not describe any other efforts made to give notice to Defendants or any reason why notice should not be required. The Motion also fails to set forth a date by which an expedited ruling is needed with accompanying reasoning.

          "description": "PAPERLESS ORDER. THIS MATTER is before the Court sua sponte. On April 29, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction. (DE 67 .) The same night, Defendants filed a Notice of Interlocutory Appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (\"Eleventh Circuit\"). (DE 68 .) On April 30, 2025, Defendants filed a Motion for Stay Pending Appeal of Preliminary Injunction (DE 69 ) (\"Motion for Stay\"). Defendants did not request an expedited ruling or briefing schedule for the Motion to Stay, so the Court maintained the usual briefing schedule specified in Local Rule 7.1(c)(1). S.D. Fla. L.R. 7(c)(1) (generally requiring a response within fourteen days of a motion's filing and any reply within seven days of the response). Pursuant to that schedule, any reply by Defendants is due by May 21, 2025. On May 7, 2025, despite the requirement that a \"party must ordinarily move first in the district court for... a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal[,]\" including \"an order suspending, modifying, restoring, or granting an injunction,\" Defendants moved in the Eleventh Circuit for a stay of the injunction pending appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1); see Appellants' Motion to Stay Injunction Pending Appeal, Fla. Immigrant Coal. v. Att'y Gen., Fla., 25-11469 (11th Cir. May 7, 2025), ECF 6. The motion filed before the Eleventh Circuit did not include a \"show[ing] that moving first in the district court would be impracticable[.]\" Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2)(A)(i). Five days later, Defendants requested the Eleventh Circuit to expedite briefing and ruling on their request. See Appellants' Time-Sensitive Motion to Expedite Consideration of Stay Pending Appeal and to Expedite Appeal, Fla. Immigrant Coal., 25-11469 (11th Cir. May 12, 2025), ECF 12. A Court \"retain[s] jurisdiction to grant [a] request for a stay despite the fact that a notice of appeal... was filed prior to the request for a stay.\" Matter of Miranne, 852 F.2d 805, 806 (5th Cir. 1988) (citing Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62); see also Doe v. Trump, 284 F. Supp. 3d 1172, 1176 (W.D. Wash. 2018) (concluding the court had \"jurisdiction to consider [d]efendants' emergency motion to stay the preliminary injunction despite the pending appeal[,]\" as part of \"preserv[ing] the status quo or ensur[ing] compliance with its earlier orders\") (citations omitted). Nonetheless, in order to avoid the usual problems that counsel against district and circuit courts exercising \"dual jurisdiction[,]\" now that Defendants have filed a duplicate motion to stay in the Eleventh Circuit, the Court will wait to consider Defendants' Motion to Stay (DE 69 ) until the Eleventh Circuit indicates its position on this matter. United States v. Roemmele, 506 F. App'x 891, 892 (11th Cir. 2013) (describing the general rule, based on interests of judicial economy and fairness to parties, that when an appeal is filed, \"the district court is divested of jurisdiction to take any action with regard to the matter except in aid of the appeal\") (emphasis in the original) (quotations omitted). Signed by Judge Kathleen M. Williams on 5/19/2025. (cgd) (Entered: 05/19/2025)"

    "summary": "<p>This case challenged a Florida law that criminalizes undocumented immigrants&rsquo; presence in the state. On April 2, 2025, the Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC) and the Farmworker Association of Florida (FWAF), along with two anonymous individual plaintiffs, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU Immigrants&rsquo; Rights Project, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and the Community Justice Project, sued the Florida Attorney General, the Statewide Prosecutor, and all twenty elected State Attorneys in their official capacities. The plaintiffs alleged that Senate Bill 4-C (&ldquo;SB 4-C&rdquo;)&mdash;which created new state crimes for &ldquo;unauthorized&rdquo; immigrants entering or remaining in Florida&mdash;was unconstitutional. They claimed that the law was preempted by federal immigration law in violation of the Supremacy Clause and violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, class certification.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>SB 4-C, enacted in 2024 and codified at Florida Statutes &sect;&sect; 811.102 and 811.103, created two felony offenses: the first criminalized knowingly entering Florida after entering the United States unlawfully; the second criminalized reentering or remaining in Florida after being deported or removed from the country. The law incorporated federal immigration law terms and carved out exceptions where the federal government had granted lawful presence. The plaintiffs argued that despite these references, the law intruded into an area exclusively governed by federal authority.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Alongside their complaint, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), a motion for a preliminary injunction (PI), and a motion for class certification. On April 3, the district court initially denied the TRO for failure to comply with local rules, but granted the TRO the next day after supplemental briefing. 778 F.Supp.3d 1315. The court enjoined enforcement of SB 4-C statewide for fourteen days, finding plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their preemption and Commerce Clause claims and faced irreparable harm.</p>\r\n<p>After the TRO went into effect, plaintiffs reported that local law enforcement officers continued to make arrests under SB 4-C. In response, the court clarified that its injunction extended to any Florida law enforcement officer with authority to enforce the statute. The defendants objected that this improperly bound non-parties and violated Federal Rule Civ. Pro. 65 (i.e. violated the injunction). The court rejected those arguments and, on April 29, 2025, granted a PI, again enjoining all enforcement of SB 4-C by any state or local officer. 780 F.Supp.3d 1235. It also provisionally certified two Rule 23(b)(2) classes representing all individuals reasonably at risk of prosecution under either section of the law. The court ordered the Attorney General to show cause why his public statements questioning the order&rsquo;s scope did not violate the injunction.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, the defendants filed a notice of appeal to the Eleventh Circuit and moved to stay the injunction pending appeal. The district court declined to rule on the stay request, deferring to the appellate court. On June 6, a motions panel of the Eleventh Circuit denied the stay. The panel concluded that the state had not shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits, finding that SB 4-C was likely subject to \"field preemption\" by the federal Immigration and Nationality Act. The court declined to stay the injunction even in part, leaving intact the provision binding non-party law enforcement officers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, the Florida Attorney General filed an emergency application with Justice Clarence Thomas, seeking a stay of the injunction from the U.S. Supreme Court pending appeal and, if necessary, future proceedings in that Court. 787 F.Supp.3d 1323. The application argued that SB 4-C merely tracked federal law and that the district court exceeded its authority by binding non-parties. It also claimed the injunction imposed irreparable harm on the state&rsquo;s sovereign interests and exposed officials to contempt for conduct they could not control. On July 9, the Supreme Court justices without comment denied a request to allow the state to enforce SB 4-C.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case remains ongoing.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenged Florida Senate Bill 4-C, a 2024 state law that created two new immigration-related felonies. On April 2, 2025, two nonprofit organizations and two individual plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida. They sued the Florida Attorney General, Statewide Prosecutor, and all 20 elected State Attorneys. Represented by the ACLU Immigrantsโ Rights Project, Americans for Immigrant Justice, and the Community Justice Project, the plaintiffs alleged that SB 4-C was preempted by federal immigration law and violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. The court issued a temporary restraining order on April 4 and granted a preliminary injunction on April 29, barring enforcement of the law by any state or local official. The court also provisionally certified two plaintiff classes. Defendants sought a stay from the Eleventh Circuit and then the U.S. Supreme Court. On July 9, the Supreme Court justices without comment denied a request to allow the state to enforce SB 4-C. As of July 10, the preliminary injunction remains in effect. The case is ongoing.",

The Court heard further arguments \nfrom the Parties at a May 29, 2025 Show Cause Hearing. (DE 89.) For the reasons set \nforth below, the Court finds that Uthmeier is in civil contempt of the Courtโs April 18, 2025 \nOrder that Defendants shall โprovide actual notice of the TROโ to all โlaw enforcement \nofficer[s] with power to enforce [S.B.] 4-C.โ (DE 49.) \nI.  INTRODUCTION \nOn April 18, 2025, the Court clarified that law enforcement officers within Florida \nwere bound by a TRO enjoining enforcement of the newly enacted criminal immigration \nPage 1 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 2 of 27\nlaw,  Florida  Senate  Bill  4-C  (โS.B.  4-Cโ  or  the  โStatuteโ),1  and  the  Court  ordered \nDefendants to โprovide actual notice of the TROโ to all โlaw enforcement officer[s] with \npower to enforce S.B. 4-C.โ (DE 49.) Uthmeier initially complied, sending a letter to law \nenforcement agency heads. (DE 57-2) (โApril 18th Letterโ) (โthe [C]ourt directed my office \nto notify your agencies of its clarification that law enforcement officers should take no \nsteps to enforce [S.B. 4-C], including through arrests or detentions . . . . โPlease instruct \nyour officers and agents to comply with Judge Williamsโ directives.โ). But on April 23, \n2025, Uthmeier sent a follow-up letter to the law enforcement community (โApril 23rd \nLetterโ), telling them, โno judicial order . . . properly restrains you fromโ enforcing S.B. 4-\nC and that โno lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies from continuing \nto enforceโ the enjoined statute. (DE 57-1 at 2.)  \nIn  his  Show  Cause  Response,  Uthmeier  posits  a  series  of  implausible \ninterpretations of the language he used to argue that his April 23rd Letter does not conflict \nwith or undermine the notice he gave in his April 18th Letter. And while insisting that the \nmeaning the Court should attach to his statements in the April 23rd Letter is that he is fully \n \n1  Broadly,  S.B.  4-C  creates  two  new  state  law  offenses:  โIllegal  entry  by  adult \nunauthorized alien into this stateโ and โIllegal reentry of an adult unauthorized alien.โ Fla. \nStat. ยงยง 811.102โ103. Section 811.102(1) prohibits any โunauthorized alien who is 18 \nyears of age or olderโ from โknowingly enter[ing] or attempt[ing] to enterโ Florida โafter \nentering  the  United  States  by  eluding  or  avoiding  examination  or  inspection  by \nimmigration  officersโ  (โillegal  entryโ).  Under  subsection  811.103(1),  an  adult \nโunauthorized alienโ commits a third-degree felony, if they โenter[], attempt[] to enter, or  \n[are]  at  any  time  found  inโ  Florida  after  โhaving  been  denied  admission,  excluded, \ndeported, or removed or having departed the United States during the time an order of \nexclusion,  deportation,  or  removal  is  outstandingโ  (โillegal  reentryโ).  Fla.  Stat.  ยง \n811.103(1).  The  Statute  has  several  other  provisions  governing  pre-trial  detention, \nsentencing, affirmative defenses, and required cooperation between the arresting agency \nand  other  state  and  local  law  enforcement  agencies.  Fla.  Stat.  ยงยง  811.102(2)โ(7), \n811.103(2)โ(6). \nPage 2 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 3 of 27\ncompliant with the Courtโs order, Uthmeier publicly disavowed his compliance on multiple \noccasionsโstating he would not โbow downโ to the Court, among other comments. \nBefore analyzing Uthmeierโs arguments, the Court will recount a more fulsome factual \nand procedural history of this case. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA. Procedural history leading up to show cause proceedings \nOn April 2, 2024, Plaintiffs2 filed a Class Action Complaint (DE 1), seeking (1) a \ndeclaration  that  S.B.  4-C  violates  the  United  States  Constitutionโs  Supremacy  and \nCommerce Clauses, and (2) injunctive relief barring enforcement of S.B. 4-C by state and \nlocal officials. (DE 1 ยถยถ 2, 5, 40.) The suit names all state prosecutorial authoritiesโAG \nUthmeier, Statewide Prosecutor Nicholas B. Cox, and the State Attorneys for the twenty \nFlorida judicial circuitsโas Defendants. (Id. ยถยถ 30โ32.) That same day, Plaintiffs filed an \nExpedited Motion for Temporary Restraining Order and Preliminary Injunction (DE 4).3 \nOn April 4, 2025, the Court entered a TRO โprohibiting Defendants and their officers, \nagents, employees, attorneys, and any person[s] who are in active concert or participation \nwith them from enforcingโ S.B. 4-C for fourteen days. (DE 28 at 14.)  \nThen, on April 18, 2025, the Court held a hearing to determine whether to convert \nthe TRO into a preliminary injunction. (DE 48.) At the hearing, Plaintiffs informed the Court \nthat law enforcement had made at least thirteen arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C since the \n \n2 Plaintiffs include individuals V.V. and Y.M., who allege they are at risk of arrest and \nprosecution  under  the  Statute,  and  two  grassroots  membership  organizations, \nFarmworker Association of Florida, Inc. and Florida Immigrant Coalition, which support \nmembers who are similarly at risk. (DE 1 ยถยถ 8, 11โ24, 26โ28.) \n3 Plaintiffs also filed a Motion for Class Certification (DE 5). The Court granted provisional \nclass certification on April 29, 2025. (DE 67 at 47.) \nPage 3 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 4 of 27\nentry of the TRO. (DE 50 at 12.) Defendants argued that law enforcement agencies, who \nwere not named parties, were not covered under the TRO, and could lawfully continue \nmaking arrests pursuant to a law for which no prosecution could follow. (Id. at 12โ15.) To \nclarify that the TRO foreclosed Defendantsโ position and to ensure the TRO provided \nPlaintiffs true relief, the Court entered the following Order (DE 49) (โApril 18th Orderโ) \nextending the timeline of the TRO and clarifying its scope: \n1.  The Temporary Restraining Order (โTROโ) (DE 28) is EXTENDED and shall \nremain in effect through April 29, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. or until further order of \nthe Court. The TRO shall be interpreted to include among those โwho are \nin active concert or participation withโ Defendants or their officers, agents, \nemployees, or attorneys, and thus prohibited from enforcing SB 4-C, the \nfollowing: any officer or other personnel within any municipal or county \npolice  department  within  Florida,  the  Florida  Department  of  Law \nEnforcement, or the Florida Highway Patrol, and any other law enforcement \nofficer with power to enforce [S.B.] 4-C. (DE 28 at 14); see also Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  65(d)(2)(C)  (including  โother  persons  who  are  in  active  concert  or \nparticipation  withโ  the  parties  or  the partiesโ  officers,  agents,  servants, \nemployees, and attorneys among those bound by any TRO). The TRO shall \nalso be interpreted to prohibit any person covered by the TRO from filing or \nmaintaining any charge pursuant to Florida Statutes section 811.102 or \n811.103. \n \n2.  Defendants shall IMMEDIATELY provide actual notice of the TRO to all \nnamed Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and \nany person who is in active concert or participation with them and who has \nnot already received actual notice [(โactual notice requirementโ or โactual \nnotice mandateโ)]. \n \n(DE 49 (emphasis omitted).) The April 18th Order also set a briefing schedule and Status \nConference for April 29, 2025 to resolve the Partiesโ disagreement over the proper scope \nof injunctive relief. (Id. at 2.)  Immediately following the April 18th Order, Uthmeier sent his \nApril 18th Letter to the law enforcement community, which complied with the actual notice \nmandate. In his correspondenceโdisseminated by email and posted on social mediaโ\nUthmeier laid out his disagreement with the Courtโs legal conclusions, and informed the \nPage 4 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 5 of 27\nrecipients of his intent to appeal the scope of the injunction: \nDear Florida law enforcement community, \n \nOn April 4, 2025, U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams issued an ex \nparte  temporary  restraining  order  prohibiting  the  Attorney  General,  the \nstatewide prosecutor, the state attorneys, as well as โtheir officers, agents, \nemployees,  attorneys,  and  any  persons  who  are  in  active  concern  or \nparticipation with themโ from enforcing Florida Statutes Sections 811.102 \nand 811.103. See DE 28, Fla. Immigrant Coal. v. Uthmeier, No 1:25-cv-\n21524. On April 18, the court extended her temporary restraining order \nthrough  April  29  and  clarified  verbally  that  her  order  covers  all  law \nenforcement officers in the State of Florida. And the court further instructed \nmy office to notify you that all Florida law enforcement agencies at present \nmust refrain from enforcing Sections 811.102 and 811.103. \n \nI must note my disagreement with this order. For reasons that my office has \nargued and will further outline in court, this clarification of Judge Williamsโ \nprior order is both wrong on the merits and overbroad on its scope. The \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure empower the federal courts to enjoin \nparties, their officers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any persons who \nare in active concert or participation with those parties from taking certain \nactions. But independent law enforcement agencies are not parties in this \ncase. At most, a district court may enjoin the law enforcement community \nwhen it is acting in concert or participating with the named defendants to \nenforce these statutes and, as my office will soon explain, the courtโs current \ninjunction exceeds that equitable limitation. I should also note that while my \noffice represents the current defendants named in this case, it does not \nrepresent nonparties like your law enforcement agencies. My office will \nnevertheless  continue  to  press  these  scope-of-relief  arguments  in  the \ndistrict court and, as appropriate, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit.  \n \nThat  said,  the  court  directed  my  office  to  notify  your  agencies  of  its \nclarification  that  law  enforcement  officers  should  take  no  steps  to \nenforce Sections 811.102 and 811.103, including through arrests or \ndetentions based on suspected violations of those provisions. Please \ninstruct  your  officers  and  agents  to  comply  with  Judge  Williamsโ \ndirectives.  \n \nA copy of the temporary restraining order is attached below.  \n \n(DE 57-2 (emphasis added).) Five days later, Uthmeier sent his follow-up April 23rd Letter, \nwhich is the subject of these show cause proceedings:  \nPage 5 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 6 of 27\nGood afternoon, \n \nI  write  to  provide  an  update  on  my  Friday,  April  18  letter.  In  that \ncommunication, I notified you that U.S. District Judge Kathleen M. Williams \nbelieved all law enforcement agencies in Florida were bound by an ex parte \ntemporary restraining order she issued on April 4, 2025 in Fla. Immigrant \nCoal. v. Uthmeier, No 1:25-cv-21524, a case in which no law enforcement \nagencies are parties. I explained that I believed her after-the-fact expansion \nof her order to nonparties was wrong, and that my office would be arguing \nas much in short order. Today, my office filed a brief explaining why her \norder cannot possibly restrain Floridaโs law enforcement agencies from \nenforcing Florida Statutes Sections 811.102 and 811.103. We will continue \nto argue that positionโincluding on appeal as soon as possible. \n \nThat said, I want to make clear what I expressed in my April 18 letter. Judge \nWilliams ordered my office to notify you of the evolving scope of her order, \nand I did so. But I cannot prevent you from enforcing ยงยง 811.102 and \n811.103, where there remains no judicial order that properly restrains \nyou from doing so. As set forth in the brief my office filed today, it is \nmy  view  that  no  lawful,  legitimate  order  currently  impedes  your \nagencies from continuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal entry and \nreentry laws. \n \n(DE 57-1 at 2 (first emphasis in the original; second emphasis added).)  \nB. Show cause proceedings \nAt the April 29, 2025 Status Conference, the Court expressed its view that \nlanguage in the April 23rd Letterโparticularly Uthmeierโs statements, โI cannot prevent \nyou from enforcing ยงยง 811.102 and 811.103, where there remains no judicial order \nthat properly restrains you from doing soโ and โit is my view that no lawful, legitimate \norder currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal \nentry  and  reentry  lawsโโappeared  to  vitiate  the  notice  to  law  enforcement  that \nUthmeier  gave  in  the  April  18th  Letter  and  that  contempt  proceedings  may  be \nwarranted. (DE 71 at 23โ24.) Defendants argued that the April 23rd Letter merely set \nout AG Uthmeierโs litigating position as detailed in Defendantsโ brief filed that day. (Id. \nat 24โ25.) Because Uthmeierโs counsel urged the Court to give Uthmeier the benefit \nPage 6 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 7 of 27\nof the doubt as to his intent regarding the April 23rd Letter, and to prevent any violations \nof the TRO by law enforcement the letter might occasion, the Court gave Uthmeier the \nopportunity to allay the Courtโs concern, and, at the request of Uthmeierโs counsel, \ntook a brief recess. (Id. at 42.)  Uthmeierโs counsel returned, declined this opportunity, \nand asked the Court for a briefing schedule on show cause proceedings. (Id. at 43.) \n  As a result, the Court required Uthmeier to show cause why he should not be \nheld in contempt or sanctioned for violating the TRO and scheduled a Show Cause \nHearing for May 29, 2025. (DE 67 at 48โ49.) Uthmeier filed a Show Cause Response, \nasserting that he had not violated either of the two mandates contained within the April \n18th Order, because: 1) he had not enforced S.B. 4-C, and 2) he provided actual notice \nof the TRO to the bound law enforcement officers in his April 18th Letter. (DE 81 at 3.) \nPlaintiffs responded that โ[b]y informing law enforcement that there was no order \nprohibiting them from enforcing S.B. 4-C, the Attorney General effectively undid the \nnotice the Court ordered him to provide and encouraged law enforcement to violate \nthe Courtโs order[.]โ (DE 87 at 3.)  \nC. Uthmeierโs public statements \nIn the weeks between sending the April 23rd Letter and the May 29, 2025 Show \nCause Hearing, Uthmeier posted several videos to his official public social media \naccountโthe same account he used to convey the contents of his lettersโshowing \nhim speaking about this matter in multiple interviews.4 Several of his statements \n \n4 Federal Rule of Evidence 201 allows the Court to โtake judicial notice on its ownโ of any \nfacts that are โnot subject to reasonable dispute becauseโ they โcan be accurately and \nreadily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.โ Fed. \nR. Evid. 201(b)โ(c). Courts nationwide have taken judicial notice of publicly accessible \nsocial media posts and other website content based on this rule. See e.g., Force v. \nPage 7 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 8 of 27\naddressed his reaction to the Courtโs April 18th Order:5    \nIn a May 6, 2025 interview, Uthmeier made the following statements:  \nInterviewer: So, youโre just trying to let cops arrest illegals in your state, \nyouโve got another one of these activist judges trying to stop you, and now \nit sounds like sheโs threatening to throw you in jail. Do I have it right? \n  \nUthmeier: Thatโs right. This judge is considering whether or not to hold \nme in contempt. But I am not going to rubber stamp her order, Iโm not \ngoing to direct law enforcement to stand down on enforcing the Trump \nagenda and carrying out Floridaโs law. Hereโs the thing, thereโs not a \nsingle law enforcement agency as a party in front of the court in this case. \nAnd as a lawyer, the first day of law school, they tell you about separation \nof powers, they tell you that a judge canโt order people around who are not \nunder the jurisdiction of the court. So Iโm not gonna do that, Iโm not going \nto bow down and withhold my oath.  \n \nInterviewer: Iโm always curious to hear the logic behind a ruling like this. \nWhat is her logic for not allowing, for demanding that cops not arrest illegal \n \nFacebook, Inc., 934 F.3d 53, 59 n.5, 61 n.8 (2d Cir. 2019) (finding proper judicial notice \nof terms and conditions publicly available on Facebookโs website and of the fact that \npublicly available news articles contained certain information); 23-34 94th St. Grocery \nCorp. v. New York City Bd. Of Health, 685 F.3d 174, 183 n.7 (2d Cir. 2012) (taking judicial \nnotice of the pictorial and written contents of a poster published on a publicly accessible \nwebsite); Al-Ahmed v. Twitter, Inc., 603 F. Supp. 3d 857, 867, 869 (N.D. Cal. 2022) (taking \njudicial notice of the contents of plaintiffโs twitter posts and direct messages). While these \ncases deal with writings and photographs rather than videos, the Court sees no relevant \ndifference between those mediums of communication. Additionally, here, the statements \nwere made by Uthmeier, and he chose to post them on his official social media account, \nplacing the accuracy of the contents even further outside of any reasonable dispute. See \nOโToole v. Northrop Grumman Corp., 499 F.3d 1218, 1224โ25 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding \ntrial courtโs refusal to take judicial notice of information posted on defendantโs website \nwas abuse of discretion, in part, because the fact that it was the defendantโs โown \ninformation[] contribute[d] to its indisputabilityโ). Therefore, the Court finds it appropriate \nto take judicial notice of Uthmeierโs statements posted to his official social media account. \nBut the Court notes that it takes judicial notice of the statements for the fact that Uthmeier \nmade them rather than for the truth of any assertions made therein. See Khoja v. Orexigen \nTherapeutics, Inc., 899 F.3d 988, 999 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding that the transcript of a \ncorporate investor call was subject to judicial notice, but โ[j]ust because the document \nitself is susceptible to judicial notice does not mean that every assertion of fact within that \ndocument is judicially noticeable for its truthโ). \n5 For the sake of brevity, the Court includes only the relevant portions of Uthmeierโs \ninterviews. However, the full interviews are viewable at the links provided below. \nPage 8 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 9 of 27\nimmigrants in the State of Florida. What is she saying? \n \nUthmeier: Itโs clear that sheโs got concerns with the law. We will appeal her \ninjunction up at the appellate level. But she wants the law enforcement \nofficers to stop committing arrests, and the problem is the ACLU didnโt sue \nany law enforcement officers. So if they want to arrest people under the \nlaw, if they want to hand them over to ICE, if they want to help the Trump \nadministration carry out detentions and deportations, they have the legal \nauthority to do that and Iโm not going to stand in their way.6  \n \n@AGJamesUthmeier,  X  (May  6,  2025,  8:57  PM)  (emphasis  added), \nhttps://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1919919529699791161.7  \nIn a May 8, 2025 interview, Uthmeier said the following: \nUthmeier: But we do have a judge who is threatening to hold me in \ncontempt because I wonโt follow an order she has to direct our law \nenforcement not to enforce a new law we passed earlier this year that \nsays you canโt be illegally in the State of Florida. \n \nInterviewer: So, this is a judge, let me get this straight, because I want to \nmake sure Iโm clear about this. This is a judge in Florida, who has decided \nthat a law that was passed by the Florida legislature and signed into law by \nGovernor  DeSantis,  that  law  enforcement  not  obeying  that  .  .  .  sheโs \nbasically directing them not to obey that law? \n \nUthmeier: [T]he interesting thing here is no law enforcement agency in the \nstate has been sued. Theyโre not a defendant. So, sheโs issuing this order \nand saying you gotta tell them all to stand down. Iโm not gonna do that. \nFirst day in law school you learn, that, you know, judges have jurisdiction, \nand you canโt order someone around whoโs not properly before the court. \nSo, Iโve said no. I mean, my argument in court is that Iโm not gonna \nwaive  my  obligation,  I  took  an  oath  to  the  constitution,  I  respect \nseparation of powers, I respect these independent law enforcement \nbodies and their prerogative to follow the law and they should do that. \n \n \n \n6 Uthmeier conflates arrests pursuant to 8 U.S.C. ยง 1357(g)(1), which allows state and \nlocal officers to enforce federal immigration laws through โ287(g) agreements,โ with \narrests under S.B. 4-C made in contravention of this Courtโs Order. Any arrests made \npursuant to a 287(g) agreement are not the subject of this litigation.  \n7 In 2023, Twitter rebranded as X.  \nPage 9 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 10 of 27\n@AGJamesUthmeier,  X  (May  8,  2025,  1:00  PM)  (emphasis  added), \nhttps://x.com/AGJamesUthmeier/status/1920524094442975631.  \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nโCourts have inherent power to enforce compliance with their lawful orders through \ncivil contempt.โ S.E.C. v. Greenberg, 105 F. Supp. 3d 1342, 1352 (S.D. Fla. 2015) (citing \nShillitani v. United States, 384 U.S. 364, 370 (1966)). Courts must be alert to the risks of \nabuse of contempt powers, for โ[u]nlike most areas of law, where a legislature defines \nboth the sanctionable conduct and the penalty to be imposed, civil contempt proceedings \nleave the offended judge solely responsible for identifying, prosecuting, adjudicating, and \nsanctioning the contumacious conduct.โ Intโl Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. \nBagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 831 (1994). That said, the contempt power is a โnecessity: Courts \nindependently must be vested with power to impose . . . submission to their lawful \nmandates[.]โ Id. (internal quotations omitted).   \nBefore a civil contempt finding can be made, the Court must establish by clear \nconvincing evidence that the following threshold criteria are met: (1) the allegedly violated \norder was valid and lawful; (2) the order was clear and unambiguous; and (3) the alleged \nviolator had the ability to comply with the order. F.T.C. v. Leshin, 618 F.3d 1221, 1232 \n(11th Cir. 2010). Then, the ultimate โfinding of civil contempt must be based on clear and \nconvincing evidence that [the] order was violated.โ Jove Engineering, Inc. v. I.R.S., 92 \nPage 10 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 11 of 27\nF.3d 1539, 1545 (11th Cir. 1996) (internal quotations omitted).89 Procedurally, once a \nprima  facie  showing  of  a  violation  is  made,  โthe  burden  then  shifts  to  the  alleged \ncontemnor to produce evidence explaining his noncompliance at a show cause hearing.โ \nLeshin, 618 F.3d at 1232 (internal quotations omitted). The alleged violator may show \n \n8 Clear and convincing proof is โmore exacting than the preponderance of the evidence \nstandard but, unlike criminal contempt, does not require proof beyond a reasonable \ndoubt.โ Ga. Power Co. v. N.L.R.B., 484 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal \nquotations omitted).  \n9 In the Show Cause Response and at the Show Cause Hearing, Uthmeier seemed to \nargue  that  layered  on  top  of  the  clear  and  convincing  standard,  the  United  States \nSupreme Court has created an additional hurdle which must be overcome before a \ncontempt finding can be made (DE 81 at 7.) Under this โrigorous standard,โ Uthmeier \nsays, โthe Court must find that โthere is no objectively reasonable basis for concluding \nthat [Uthmeierโs] conduct might be lawful.โ (Id. (quoting Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. \n554, 561 (2019)).) But Uthmeier misreads Taggart.   \nIn Taggart, the Court was interpreting two bankruptcy code provisions, which together \nallowed a bankruptcy court to hold creditors in civil contempt for violating a discharge \norder. Id. at 556. The Court was presented with two suggested standards for analyzing a \npossible contempt finding, a strict liability standard and a subjective standard. Id. Instead, \nthe Taggart Court decided that โtraditional civil contempt principles apply straightforwardly \nto the bankruptcy discharge context[,]โ and applied an objective standard, which courts \nhave long used to analyze civil contempt. Id. at 561. So, the Court was not announcing a \nnew  standard  for  analyzing  civil  contempt,  as  Uthmeier  argues,  but  applying  well-\nestablished civil contempt principles to the bankruptcy context. This is confirmed by the \nEleventh  Circuitโs  continued  use  of  the  standard  described  in  Leshin  and  Jove \nEngineering in cases after Taggart. E.g. Peery v. City of Miami, 977 F.3d 1061, 1076โ77 \n(11th Cir. 2020); OโNeal v. Allstate Indem. Co., No. 22-11120, 2023 WL 5624158, at *5 \n(11th Cir. Aug. 31, 2023); United States v. Mayer, No. 20-10231, 2022 WL 203338, at *1 \n(11th Cir. Jan. 24, 2022); F.T.C. v. Natโl Urological Grp., 786 F. Appโx 947, 954 (11th Cir. \n2019).  \nThe language that Uthmeier seizes on, dicta from an 1885 case, was part of the Courtโs \ndiscussion of the principle that โthose enjoined receive explicit notice of what conduct is \noutlawed before being held in civil contempt.โ Id. (quoting Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. \n473, 476 (1974) (holding that the injunction was too vague to provide notice of what \nconduct is outlawed); then citing Intโl Longshoreman Assโn v. Philadelphia Marine Trade \nAssโn, 389 U.S. 64, 76 (1967) (guiding that civil contempt cannot be โfounded upon a \ndecree too vague to understandโ)). That principle is embodied in the current standardโs \nrequirement that an order be clear and unambiguous to form the basis of contempt.  \nPage 11 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 12 of 27\nthat he did not violate the court order or was excused from complying based on an inability \nto comply despite making all reasonable efforts. Chairs v. Burgess, 143 F.3d 1432, 1436 \n(11th Cir. 1998). \nWhether conduct violates an order is an objective question. See Ga. Power Co., \n484 F.3d at 1291 (โOur focus in a civil contempt proceeding โis not on the subjective \nbeliefs or intent of the alleged contemners in complying with the order, but whether in fact \ntheir  conduct  complied  with  the  order  at  issue.โโ)  (quoting Howard  Johnson  Co.  v. \nKhimani, 892 F.2d 1512, 1516 (11th Cir.1990)). Therefore, โthe absence of wilfulness is \nnot a defense to a charge of civil contempt. Leshin, 618 F.3d at 1232 (citing McComb v. \nJacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 1919 (1949)).  \nIV.  DISCUSSION \nA. Contempt10 \nUthmeier does not dispute any of the three threshold criteria. First, Defendants \n \n10 Plaintiffs argue that in addition to violating the actual notice requirement, Uthmeierโs \nstatements are contemptuous because they encourage or induce violations of the TRO \nby law enforcement officers. (DE 87 at 17โ19 (citing Inst. of Cetacean Rsch. v. Sea \nShepherd Conservation Socโy, 774 F.3d 935, 952 (9th Cir. 2014)).) But in Cetacean \nResearch, a non-party had carried out acts that violated the terms of the injunction where \nthe party had provided active financial, logistical, and other material support to the non-\nparties to aid in the violation. Inst. of Cetacean Rsch., 774 F.3d at 945. Indeed, the \nCetacean Research court was analyzing whether the party was in contempt as an โaider[] \nand  abettor[]โ  of  a  non-partyโs  violation.  Id.  at  948.  Courts  were  analyzing  similar \nsituations in the other cases Plaintiffs cite. N.L.R.B. v. Laborerโs Intern Union of N.A., 882 \nF.2d 949, 950, 954 (5th Cir. 1989) (finding a party had aided and abetted another party \nunion in evading paying a judgment by approving the restructuring of that union into a \nnew entity); Roe v. Operation Rescue, 919 F.2d 857, 860, 871 (3d Cir. 1990) (affirming \ncontempt finding of TRO enjoining protest activity at certain abortion facilities against a \nparty who, while physically standing just off the property, gave instructions to on-site \nprotestors through a headset). As of the date of this Order, there is no record evidence of \nany violative arrests or prosecutions since April 18, 2025, and Uthmeierโs statements \nwould  not  have  risen  to  the  level  of  providing  material  support  if  there  had  been. \nTherefore, the Court does not agree, at this time, that Uthmeier has violated the TRO by \nPage 12 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 13 of 27\nhave repeatedly acknowledged during hearings that the April 18th Order was binding. (DE \n71 at 23 (โWell, to be perfectly clear, Judge, we think that in light of the Courtโs clarified \norder  .  .  .  on  the  18th  that  law  enforcement  officers  should  comply  with  your  \ndirective . . . . So thatโs our position, that thereโs a TRO in place, and weโre abiding by it, \nand weโve asked the law enforcement officers to also abide by it.โ); id. at 26 (โWell, Judge, \nour legal position remains today . . . that until overruled, your injunctions are binding on \neverybody that the Court has said is encompassed by the scope. So that's our view. \nThat's not to say that we won't exercise our appellate options in the event that there is a \npreliminary injunction issued, but I think that's a different question[.]โ); id. at 30 (โJudge, I \nwould agree that the named defendants and the law enforcement officers today are \nbound.โ).) While Defendants have appealed the Courtโs grant of injunctive relief, โ[i]t is \nwell established that an order duly issued by a court having subject-matter jurisdiction \nover a case or controversy before it, and personal jurisdiction over the parties to that case \nor controversy, must be obeyed, regardless of the ultimate validity of the order.โ In re \nNovak, 932 F.2d 1397, 1400 (11th Cir. 1991) (first citing Maness v. Meyers, 419 U.S. 449, \n459 (1975); then citing United States v. United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 293 (1947); \nand then citing United States v. Dickinson, 465 F.2d 496, 509 (5th Cir. 1972)); J.G.G. v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 1119481, --F. Supp. 3d--, at *1 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025) (โ[I]t is a \nfoundational legal precept that every judicial order โmust be obeyedโโno matter how \nโerroneous it โmay beโโ until a court reverses it. . . . If a party chooses to disobey the \norderโrather  than  wait  for  it  to  be  reversed  through  the  judicial  processโsuch \n \nenforcing or instructing law enforcement to enforce S.B. 4-C, or by aiding and abetting \nany actual violation. The remainder of the Courtโs contempt analysis will be limited to the \nquestion of whether Uthmeier violated the April 18th Orderโs actual notice requirement.  \nPage 13 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 14 of 27\ndisobedience is punishable as contempt, notwithstanding any later-revealed deficiencies \nin the order.โ) (emphasis in the original) (quoting Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. \n307, 314 (1967)).  \nNeither does Uthmeier challenge whether the actual notice requirement was clear \nand unambiguous. To the contrary, Uthmeier described the order as a โclear command[.]โ \n(DE 81 at 3.) Finally, Uthmeier does not dispute that he had the ability to comply with the \norder; there is no question of his ability to comply, given that he initially did so in the April \n18th Letter.  \n1.  The April 23rd Letter vitiated the actual notice given in the April 18th Letter \n   The only question is whether Uthmeierโs April 23rd Letter negated the notice he \ngave in the April 18th Letter, violating Defendantsโ obligation to โprovide actual notice of \nthe TROโ to all law enforcement officer[s] with the power to enforce S.B. 4-C.โ (DE 49.) \nAnswering this question requires some discussion about the purpose and meaning of the \nApril 18th Order. See United States v. Christie Indus., Inc., 465 F.2d 1002, 1007 (3d Cir. \n1972) (โThe language of an injunction must be read in the light of the circumstances \nsurrounding its entry: the relief sought by the moving party, the evidence produced at the \nhearing on the injunction, and the mischief that the injunction seeks to prevent.โ) (citations \nomitted).  \nThe Court entered the April 18th Order after hearing that law enforcement officers \nwere making arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C, despite the Courtโs issuance of a TRO pausing \nenforcement of the Statute. The clear purpose of the April 18th Order was to prevent any \nsuch future arrests; the actual notice requirement was designed to address any law \nenforcement personnel who might make an arrest pursuant to S.B. 4-C based on the \nPage 14 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 15 of 27\nmisapprehension that they were not bound by the TRO.  \nโโ[A]ctual noticeโ is synonymous with knowledge.โ Rosebud LMS Inc. v. Adobe Sys. \nInc., 812 F.3d 1070, 1074 (Fed. Cir. 2016) (quoting 58 Am.Jur.2d Notice ยง 4 (2015) \n(explaining that โ[a]ctual notice rests upon personal information or knowledgeโ and โstems \nfrom and means that the party has actual knowledge of [the] fact in question.โ)); see also \nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Kirtsaeng, No. 08 Civ. 7834, 2009 WL 3817407, at *3 (S.D.N.Y \nNov. 9, 2009) (โNotice is regarded as actual where the person charged with notice either \nknows the particular facts in question or is conscious of having the means to know \nthem[.]โ). Consequently, what matters is what law enforcement officers are likely to \nunderstand from the information Uthmeier gives them. See e.g., Brody v. Vill. of Port \nChester, 509 F. Supp. 2d 269, 284 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (analyzing the possibility that the \ncontent of a notice of was insufficient to provide actual notice). A directive that Uthmeier \nprovide actual notice is not satisfied by sending the TRO and initially informing law \nenforcement officers that they are bound, and then issuing subsequent statements that \nare likely to mislead law enforcement officers into believing they are not bound. This \ndefeats actual notice. \nIn a variety of ways, Uthmeierโs April 23rd Letter conveyed to law enforcement that \nthey could and should disregard the April 18th Letterโs message that they were required \nby court order to cease enforcement of S.B. 4-C. In the opening sentences of the letter, \nUthmeier recharacterized the April 18th Order as the Courtโs โbelie[f],โ rather than the \nCourtโs โorderโ that law enforcement officers were bound by the TRO. Compare (DE 57-\n1 at 2), with (DE 57-2 at 2.) After telling the recipients that Defendants had filed a brief \narguing that the Courtโs โafter-the-fact expansion of [its] orderโ was wrong, Uthmeier \nPage 15 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 16 of 27\nmade the remarks in the second paragraph of the letter that are at the heart of this inquiry. \n(DE 57-1 at 2.) \nInitially,  the  introductory  sentence  of  the  second  paragraph  implied  that  the \nparagraph was redefining the April 18th Letter in some way. (Id. (โI want to make clear \nwhat I expressed in my April 18 letter.โ)) Uthmeier went on to inform law enforcement, โI \ncannot prevent you from enforcing [S.B. 4-C], where there remains no judicial order that \nproperly restrains you from doing so. . . .[, and] it is my view that no lawful, legitimate \norder currently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforceโ the law. (Id.) This \nlanguage is a direct contradiction of his prior notice to law enforcement agency heads \nthat they should โinstruct [their] officers and agents to comply with Judge Williamsโ \ndirectivesโ that โlaw enforcement officers should take no steps to enforce [S.B. 4-C.]โ (DE \n57-2 at 3.) In fact, it is difficult to imagine language better crafted to reverse officersโ \nunderstanding of whether they are bound by the TRO short of โI hereby revoke my actual \nnotice of April 18, 2025 and inform you that no court order prohibits your enforcement of \nS.B. 4-C.โ11  \n \n11 At the Show Cause Hearing, Uthmeierโs counsel contended that the absence of any \nconfirmed arrests in violation of the TRO since the April 18th Order is evidence that the \nApril 23rd Letter was not understood by its recipients as a green light to continue enforcing \nS.B. 4-C. While the Court is encouraged that arrests have ceased, this does not alter the \nCourtโs conclusion on contempt. Even if the Court could be certain that there have been \nno recent arrests, this may well be in spite of the April 23rd Letter. In any event, while \nUthmeier has presented no direct evidence of law enforcement officersโ understanding of \nthe April 23rd Letter, the โreaction of the recipientsโ is but one of many factors Courts โtake \ninto considerationโ when objectively analyzing a communication. United States v. Baker, \n514 F. Supp. 3d 1369, 1380 (N.D. Fla. 2021); see also United States v. Dillard, 835 F. \nSupp.  2d  1120,  1123  (D.  Kan.  2011)  (describing  the  objective  analysis  of  a \ncommunication as asking how โโan ordinary, reasonable person who is familiar with the \ncontext of the communication would interpret itโโ and being โa fact-intensive inquiry, in \nwhich the language, the context in which the statements were made, as well as the \nrecipientsโ responses are all relevantโ) (quoting first Nielander v. Bd. of Cnty. Commโrs, \nPage 16 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 17 of 27\n2.  Uthmeierโs alternative explanations for the final two sentences of the \nApril 23rd Letter are implausible \nIn response, Uthmeier maintains that โreading the letter as a whole and in the \ncontext of what preceded it,โ the letter is properly understood to โkeep [law enforcement] \ninformedโ of updates in the litigation and โexplain . . . the legal views the Attorney General \nexpressed in his brief, and . . . the scope of his authority, as opposed to the Courtโs \nauthority.โ (DE 81 at 9โ11 (emphasis in the original).) In fact, Uthmeier states, the April \n23rd Letter โexpressly reiterated the Courtโs conclusion that the TRO โboundโ the letterโs \nrecipients.โ (Id. at 10 (quoting DE 57-1 at 2).) These explanations are untenable.  \n  First,  it  may  well  be  true  that  Uthmeier  wanted  to  keep  the  non-party  law \nenforcement officers apprised of his recent filings in the case, his litigation plan, and his \nlegal views. However, this explains the first paragraph of the April 23rd Letter, not the \nproblematic second paragraph. In the first paragraph, Uthmeier tells the readers that his \nโoffice filed a brief explaining why [the Courtโs] order cannot possibly restrain Floridaโs \nlaw enforcement agencies from enforcing [S.B. 4-C]โ and โwill continue to argue that \npositionโincluding  on  appeal  as  soon  as  possible.โ  (DE  57-1  at  2.)  Unfortunately, \nUthmeier continued.  \n  Uthmeier argues that the second paragraphโparticularly the language โI cannot \nprevent you from enforcing [S.B. 4-C], where there remains no judicial order that properly \nrestrains from doing soโโclarifies that law enforcement are enjoined pursuant to the \nCourtโs authority, not his. (DE 81 at 10โ11.) But as Plaintiffs point out, the second clause \n \n582 F.3d 1155, 1167โ68 (10th Cir. 2009); and then quoting United States v. Spring, 305 \nF.3d 276, 280 (4th Cir. 2002)).   \nPage 17 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 18 of 27\nof that sentence undermines Uthmeierโs suggested reading. (DE 87 at 13 n.7 (โ[T]he \nletterโread objectivelyโasserts that the Attorney General lacks authority to prevent \nenforcement  because  there  is  no  valid  injunction  against  such  enforcement.  That \nstatement, if anything, suggests the Attorney General would otherwise have authority to \ncontrol law enforcement.โ). Had Uthmeier wanted law enforcement to understand his \nposition that he does not control them because he is not a judicial officer or because law \nenforcement  agencies  are  independent  from  the  Attorney  General  under  Floridaโs \nconstitutional and statutory framework, he should have said exactly that rather than cast \nthe Courtโs order as illegitimate. Moreover, this argument cannot explain the subsequent \nsentence, which expresses Uthmeierโs view โthat no lawful legitimate order currently \nimpedesโ officers from enforcing S.B. 4-C, without anywhere mentioning Uthmeierโs \ncontrol over those officers.12 (DE 57-1 at 2.) \n  Uthmeierโs final effort to salvage the April 23rd Letter is to quote a portion of the \nsecond sentence of the letter and portray it as a reiteration of the notice he provided in \nthe April 18th Letter. (DE 81 at 18 (โ[N]othing in the April 23 Letter revoked the Attorney \nGeneralโs prior notice. To the contrary, the April 23 Letter reiterates the April 18 Letter. It \nsays: โall law enforcement agencies in Florida were bound by an ex parte temporary \nrestraining order.โ).) Uthmeier is grasping at semantic straws. The full sentence and the \n \n12 Uthmeier argues that this last sentence merely lays out the arguments made in his \nbrief. (DE 81 at 10.) This interpretation would make the sentence wholly redundant, given \nthe first paragraph of the letter. See Antonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law: \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 167 (2012) (guiding that interpretation of a legal text \nshould โconsider the entire text, in view of its structure and of the physical and logical \nrelation of its many parts.โ). But more importantly, despite mentioning his brief, Uthmeier \ndoes not phrase his view as a legal argument, but as a statement of the law enforcement \nofficersโ current legal ability to enforce the Statute. (DE 57-1 at 2.) \nPage 18 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 19 of 27\nfull letter do not repeat the message that all law enforcement agencies in Florida continue \nto be bound by the TRO. The sentence recasts the Courtโs Order as a matter of the \njudgeโs โbelie[f],โ and the letter concludes by telling law enforcement that โthere remains \nno judicial order that properly restrainsโ them from enforcing S.B. 4-C. (DE 57-1 at 2.)   \n  In short, the final two sentences of the April 23rd Letter, taken in the context of the \npreceding paragraph, the April 18th Letter, and the procedural realities of the litigation, \nwould undermine a reasonable law enforcement officerโs understanding that they were \nprohibited by the April 18th Order from enforcing S.B. 4-C. Therefore, they effectively \nrescind  Uthmeierโs  previous  notice  and  violate  the  April  18th  Orderโs  actual  notice \nrequirement. \n3.  Uthmeierโs public comments conflict with his argument \nUthmeierโs argument that his April 23rd Letter was not designed to rescind the \nnotice given in his April 18th Letter also conflicts with his own public statements. When \nasked in a May 6, 2025 interview about the pending show cause proceedings, Uthmeier \nstated that he was, in fact, refusing to comply with the Courtโs order. He said, โThis judge \nis considering whether or not to hold me in contempt. But I am not going to rubber \nstamp her order, Iโm not going to direct law enforcement to stand down on . . . \ncarrying out Floridaโs law. . . . So Iโm not gonna do that, Iโm not going to bow down[.]โ13 \nLater in that interview, Uthmeier was asked about the TRO, and he doubled down on the \nproblematic language in his April 23rd Letter: โif [law enforcement officers] want to arrest \n \n13 In this comment, as in others quoted here, Uthmeier mischaracterizes the nature of the \nCourtโs actual notice requirement. Defendants were ordered to inform law enforcement \nofficers  that  the  Court  had  enjoined  their  enforcement  of  S.B.  4-C.  Uthmeierโs \nmischaracterization does not change his message, which is a clear proclamation of his \nrefusal to comply with the actual notice mandate. \nPage 19 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 20 of 27\npeople under the law . . . they have the authority to do that and Iโm not going to stand in \ntheir way.โ  \nTwo days later, Uthmeier publicly reaffirmed his unwillingness to follow the April \n18th Order and then tripled down on his revocation of the April 18th Letter. He said, โ[W]e \nhave a judge who is threatening to hold me in contempt because I wonโt follow an \norder she has to direct our law enforcement not to enforce [S.B. 4-C]. . . . So, sheโs \nissuing this order and saying you gotta tell them all to stand down. Iโm not gonna do \nthat.โ Moments later, he added, โI respect these independent law enforcement bodies \nand their prerogative to follow the law and they should do that.โ  \nThe  Court  analyzes  the  objective  meaning  of  the  April  23rd  Letter  without \nconsidering Uthmeierโs subjective intent. See Ga. Power Co., 484 F.3d at 1291. However, \nthe statements are relevant. First, to the extent there is any question about the ambiguity \nof the April 18th Order, Uthmeierโs โrecord of continuing and persistent violations and \npersistent contumacy justif[y] placing the burden of any uncertainty in the [Order] on \n[Uthmeierโs] shoulders.โ Taggart, 587 U.S. at 562 (alterations and internal quotations \nomitted).  Additionally,  Uthmeierโs  repeated  reinforcement  of  his  message  that  law \nenforcement is not bound, intentional or not, increases the chance of harm from his \ncontinued noncompliance.14 \n \n14 The Court recognizes Uthmeier may still be acclimating to the new and difficult role of \nattorney general, which he began two months prior to this case without the benefit of \nsignificant experience managing civil or criminal litigations. The Court gives Uthmeier the \nbenefit of the doubt that his words were, as his Counsel said at the Show Cause Hearing, \nmerely โpuffery,โ and that he did not intend to undermine the integrity of the Court or place \nlaw enforcement officers at risk of being held liable for committing constitutional violations. \nAgain, however, โabsence of willfulness does not relieve from civil contemptโ so โit matters \nnot with what intent [Uthmeier] did the prohibited act.โ McComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., \n336 U.S. 187, 191 (1949); see also Leshin, 618 F.3d at 1233 (โWe do not focus โon the \nPage 20 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 21 of 27\n4.  Uthmeierโs request for special solicitude is misplaced \nFinally, Uthmeier asserts that the Court โowe[s] him respect as an official and . . . \nthe most careful and reasoned treatment as party or as litigant[,]โ and should therefore \nrefrain from finding him in contempt. (DE 81 at 16โ17 (quoting In re Attorney General of \nU.S., 596 F.2d 58, 64 (2d Cir. 1979)) (arguing contempt proceedings against a state \nattorney general risk disrupting the sensitive balances of power between the state and \nfederal governments and between the judiciary and executive branches).)  The Court is \naware  of  Uthmeierโs  status  as  the  stateโs  chief  legal  officer  and  appreciates  the \nimportance of his relationship with members of Floridaโs public, the law enforcement \ncommunity, and other government actors. Fla. Const. art. IV sec. 4(b) (providing that the \nโattorney general shall be the chief state legal officerโ); State v. Love, 126 So. 374, 376 \n(Fla. 1930) (โThe Attorney-General is the attorney and legal guardian of the people . . . . \n[I]t is his duty to use means most effectual to the enforcement of the laws, and the \nprotection of the people.โ).  \nIndeed, as the stateโs chief legal officer, Uthmeier has the weighty responsibility of \ngiving โofficial opinion[s] and legal adviceโ to state and local government actors. Fla. Stat. \nยง 16.01(3). So when Uthmeier speaks in his official capacity, his words have power. See \nAm. Home Assur. Co. v. Natโl R.R. Passenger Corp., 908 So. 2d 459, 473 (Fla. 2005) \n(describing the legal opinion of the Attorney General as โentitled to careful considerationโ \nand generally โregarded as highly persuasiveโ); United States v. Koubriti, 305 F. Supp. \n2d 723, 759 (E.D. Mich. 2003) (sanctioning the United States Attorney General for \n \nsubjective beliefs or intent of the alleged contemners in complying with the order, but \nwhether in fact their conduct complied with the order at issue.โโ) (quoting Ga. Power Co., \n484 F.3d at 1291). \nPage 21 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 22 of 27\nviolating court order by making prejudicial public statements about an ongoing criminal \nproceeding, and noting that as the โattorney for the body politicโ there is โa material \ndifference between a [public statement] issued by the Attorney General and one given \nout  by  an  attorney  for  a  private  clientโ)  (quoting  ABA  Comm.  on  Prof'l  Ethics  and \nGrievances, Formal Op. 199 (1940)). As Attorney General, Uthmeier also has other \nโimportant and far-ranging responsibilities, including the power to institute litigation on his \nown initiative. . . . [o]n behalf of the state[.]โ Fla. Carry, Inc. v. Univ. of N. Fla., 133 So. 3d \n966, 989 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2013) (Makar, J., concurring) (alterations and internal \nquotations omitted).  \nUthmeierโs role endows him with a unique capacity to uphold or undermine the rule \nof law, and when he does the latter by violating a court order, the integrity of the legal \nsystem depends on his conduct being within the Courtโs remedial reach. See J.G.G, 2025 \nWL 1119481, at *1 (โThe Constitution does not tolerate willful disobedience of judicial \nordersโespecially by officials of a coordinate branch who have sworn an oath to uphold \nit. To permit such officials to freely โannul the judgments of the courts of the United Statesโ \nwould not just โdestroy the rights acquired under those judgmentsโ; it would make โa \nsolemn mockeryโ of โthe constitution itself. . . . So fatal a result must be deprecated by \nall.โโ) (quoting United States v. Peters, 9 U.S. (5 Cranch) 115, 136 (1809) (Marshall, C.J.)). \nThe very cases Uthmeier cites to support the notion that his status somehow shields him \nfrom a contempt finding bolster this principle. E.g. Newman v. State of Ala., 683 F.2d \n1312,  1318  (11th  Cir.  1982)  (โWhile  a  federal  court  is  always  reluctant  to  coerce \ncompliance with its decrees by incarcerating a state official, if that official is in contempt \nthere can be no doubt of the courtโs authority to do soโ); In re Attorney General, 596 F.2d \nPage 22 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 23 of 27\nat 64 (โ[W[e unequivocally affirm the principle that no person is above the lawโ).15  \nEqually  important  is  the  lawโs  commitment  to  free  speech,  including  that  of \ngovernment officials and anyone whose speech criticizes courts. โCriticism keeps us on \nour toes and helps us do a better job. . . . Courts . . . speak with the knowledge of their \nimperfections but also with a sense that they instill a fidelity to law that would be sorely \nmissed in their absence.โ Abrego Garcia v. Noem, No. 25-1404, 2025 WL 1135112, at *2 \n(4th Cir. Apr. 17, 2025). To be clear, the Court is unconcerned with Uthmeierโs criticism \nand disapproval of the Court and the Courtโs Order. But respect for the integrity of court \norders is of paramount importance. Within the bounds of the local rules and professional \nrules of conduct,16 Uthmeier is free to broadcast his continued appeal of the Courtโs \n \n15 In re Attorney General featured a court order requiring the United States Attorney \nGeneral to release to opposing litigants the names of confidential government informants \nand  the  Attorney  Generalโs  assertion  โthat  the  [courtโs]  failure  to  recognize  the \n[governmentโs claim of] privilege would adversely affect the entire law enforcement and \nintelligence-gathering apparatus of the United States.โ 596 F.2d at 64. Here, the Court \nissued a routine order to Defendants to give actual notice to a non-party who was bound \nby the Courtโs injunctive relief. This case is devoid of the features that created sensitive \nseparation of powers concerns in In re Attorney General. Meanwhile, in Newman, the \nplaintiffs had failed to move the court to initiate contempt proceedings following the state \nofficial defendantsโ violations of an injunction, and the Eleventh Circuit repeatedly guided \nthem that moving for contempt would have been the proper remedy to pursue. 683 F.2d \nat 1318โ20 (โIn this case the plaintiffs chose to ignore equityโs time-honored contempt \nprocedure in their effort to obtain the Stateโs compliance with the . . . [consent] decree.โ).  \n16 Florida Bar Rule of Professional Conduct 4-8.4(d) provides, in part, that โ[a] lawyer shall \nnot . . . engage in conduct in connection with the practice of law that is prejudicial to the \nadministration  of  justice,  including  to  knowingly,  or  through  callous  indifference, \ndisparage, humiliate, or discriminate against litigants, jurors, witnesses, court personnel, \nor other lawyers on any basis.โ Rule 4-8.2(a) prohibits a lawyer from โmak[ing] a statement \nthat the lawyer knows to be false or with reckless disregard as to its truth or falsity \nconcerning the qualifications or integrity of a judge[.]โ Fla. Bar R. of Pro. Conduct 4-8.2(a). \nRule 4-8.4(c) prohibits โengag[ing] in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or \nmisrepresentation[.]โ Fla. Bar R. of Pro. Conduct 4-8.4(c). And finally, the Florida Bar Rule \nregulating  public  pretrial  statements  provides  that  โ[a]  lawyer  shall  not  make  an \nextrajudicial statement that a reasonable person would expect to be disseminated by \nmeans of public communication if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that it will \nPage 23 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 24 of 27\ninjunction and his view that the Courtโs rulings are erroneous. However, when instructed \nto inform law enforcement that they are proscribed from enforcing an enjoined law, he \nmay not tell them otherwise. \nB. Sanctions \nโDistrict  courts  have  broad  discretion  in  fashioning  civil  contempt  remedies.โ \nHoward Johnson, 892 F.2d at 1519 (citing United Mine Workers, 330 U.S. at 303โ04). \nBut civil contempt sanctions must serve โeither or both of two purposes: to coerce the \ndefendant into compliance with the courtโs order, and to compensate the complainant for \nlosses sustained.โ In re McLean, 794 F.3d 1313, 1323 (11th Cir. 2015) (citations omitted). \nโA coercive contempt sanction comes with limitations; for instance, once a contemnorโs \ncontumacious conduct has ceased or the contempt has been purged, no further sanctions \nare permissible.โ F.T.C. v. Leshin, 719 F.3d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir. 2013) (citation omitted), \ncert. denied, Leshin v. F.T.C., 571 U.S. 1126 (2014). In contrast, the Courtโs โdiscretion \nin  imposing  non-coercive  sanctions  is  particularly  broad  and  only  limited  by  the \nrequirement that they be compensatory.โ Id. (quoting Howard Johnson, 892 F.2d at 1521). \nโThe measure of the courtโs power in civil contempt proceedings is determined by the \nrequirements of full remedial relief.โ Id. (quoting McComb, 336 U.S. at 193).  \n  At  the  Show  Cause  Hearing,  Plaintiffs  stated  that  their  priority  is  to  ensure \nUthmeierโs statements do not result in harm to provisional class members in the form of \narrests and detentions. Since the Court has not been made aware of any arrests or \n \nhave a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding due to \nits creation of an imminent and substantial detrimental effect on that proceeding.โ Fla. Bar \nR. of Pro. Conduct 4-3.6(a). The Southern District of Florida Local Rules incorporate \nthese rules. S.D. Fla. L.R. 11.1(c).      \nPage 24 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 25 of 27\ndetentions pursuant to S.B. 4-C since the April 18th Order, Plaintiffs have been spared the \ndownstream costs and attorneysโ fees, such as those arising from monitoring cases and \ncoordinating release.  \n  The Court agrees the most critical remedial goal is ensuring that the original \npurpose of the April 18th Order, to prevent enforcement of S.B. 4-C, is fulfilled. Therefore, \nthe Court will require Uthmeier to coordinate with the State Attorney Defendants and their \nlaw  enforcement  partners  to  file  bi-weekly  reports  detailing  whether  any  arrests, \ndetentions, or law enforcement actions pursuant to S.B. 4-C have occurred, and if so, \nhow many, when, and by which law enforcement agency. Further, if Defendants learn of \nany arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C, Defendants must immediately file notice informing the \nCourt. In the event this occurs, the Court will require Defendants to re-notice the arresting \nlaw  enforcement  agency  to  prevent  future  violations.17  These  sanctions  have  both \ncoercive and compensatory elements. The bi-weekly reports are meant to shift the costs \nof  continued  monitoring  for  violative  law  enforcement  activityโmade  necessary  by \nUthmeierโs contumacious conductโonto Uthmeier and away from Plaintiffs. The re-\nnoticing requirement is meant to bring Uthmeier into compliance with the April 18th Order, \nshould harm result from his noncompliance. Finally, if Uthmeier does not comply with \nthese remedial sanctions, the Court will consider further sanctions, including fines and \nfees to compensate Plaintiffs for costs of enforcing the Courtโs order. \n \n \n17 The Court will also require that the language in any notice be given to Plaintiffs and the \nCourt for review before being sent to the law enforcement agency. \nPage 25 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 26 of 27\nV.  CONCLUSION \nOver a century ago, author and sometime logician Lewis Carroll guided readers \nthrough the looking glass.18 Among the adventures there, we encounter a character who \nboasts of his mastery of words:  \nโWhen I use a word,โ Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful \ntone, โit means just what I choose it to meanโneither more \nnor less.โ \n \nโThe question is,โ said Alice, โwhether you can make words \nmean so many different things.โ19  \n \nThe answer then, as now, is no. Litigants cannot change the plain meaning of words as \nit suits them, especially when conveying a courtโs clear and unambiguous order. Fidelity \nto the rule of law can have no other meaning. \nTherefore, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: \n1.  The Court finds Uthmeier in civil contempt of the Courtโs April 18th Order (DE \n49)  requiring  Defendants  to  provide actual notice of the  TRO  to  any  law \nenforcement officer with power to enforce S.B. 4-C.  \n2.  Uthmeier shall FILE BI-WEEKLY REPORTS detailing whether any arrests, \ndetentions, or law enforcement actions pursuant to S.B. 4-C have occurred, \nand if so, how many, when, and by which law enforcement agency. The first \nreport shall be filed on or before July 1, 2025. Further, If Defendants learn of \nany arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C, Uthmeier shall file notice informing the Court \nof the details of the arrests immediately. Uthmeier may seek modification or \n \n18 Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There (1871). \n19 Id. at 269โ70. \nPage 26 of 27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 96   Entered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2025   Page 27 of 27\ntermination of this reporting requirement after six months.  \nDONE AND ORDERED in Chambers in Miami, Florida, on this 17th day of June, \n2025. \n \nPage 27 of 27 \n ",

Garcia, 589 U.S. \n191, 212 (2020). Even in the immigration context, โthe historic police powers of the \nStates are not superseded unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.โ \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 400 (2012) (cleaned up). As a result, states are not \nwithout โpower to deter the influx of persons entering the United States against federal \nlaw,โ Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 228 n.23 (1982), just as at the Founding, Mayor of City \nof New York v. Miln, 36 U.S. (11 Pet.) 102, 132-33 (1837). When Congress โprescribe[s] \nwhat it believes to be appropriate standards for the treatment of [aliens], the States may, \nof course, follow the federal direction.โ Plyler, 457 U.S. at 219 n.19.  \nFlorida did nothing more in enacting SB 4-C. To aid the United States in curbing \nillegal immigration within the Stateโs borders, SB 4-C criminalizes the entry into Florida \nof those who have illegally entered the United States. Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102, 811.103. \nThat law tracks federal law to a tee. See 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1325(a), 1326(a)(2). It also retains \nfederal-law defenses and says nothing of who should be admitted or removed from the \ncountry. As Justice Scalia observed, Florida โhas moved to protect its sovereigntyโnot \nin contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance with it.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. \nat 437 (Scalia, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part). โIf securing its territory in this \nfashion is not within the power of [Florida], we should cease referring to it as a sover-\neign State.โ Id.  \n1 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 13 of 34 \n \nDespite those principles, the district court preliminarily enjoined Defendants \nfrom enforcing SB 4-C. That was error. Plaintiffs lack a cause of action to enforce fed-\neral immigration law. They also have failed to prove their facial challengeโโthe most \ndifficult challenge to mountโโbecause they cannot show that โno set of circumstances \nexists under which the Actโ would comply with federal immigration law and the \nDormant Commerce Clause. United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 745 (1987). And in all \nevents, the district courtโs order wrongly binds all of Floridaโs law-enforcement offic-\nersโwho are not parties, not the partiesโ agents, and not acting in concert with the \npartiesโflouting longstanding equitable principles entitling every litigant to โtheir day \nin court.โ Alemite Mfg. Corp. v. Staff, 42 F.2d 832, 832-33 (2d Cir. 1930) (Hand, J.). \nThe Court should stay the injunction.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  SB 4-C \nIn 2025, Florida passed SB 4-C. That law created two new crimes. The first pro-\nvision (the entry provision) bars โunauthorized alien[s]โ from โknowingly enter[ing]โ \nFlorida โafter entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspec-\ntion by immigration officers.โ Fla. Stat. ยง 811.102(1). That conforms to federal law, \nwhich criminalizes entry by evading inspection. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325(a). Florida law defines \nan โunauthorized alienโ as โa person who is unlawfully present in the United States \naccording to the terms of the federal Immigration and Nationality Actโ and federal \nregulations. Fla. Stat. ยง 908.111(1)(d). SB 4-C provides that entry is not a crime if โ[t]he \n2 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 14 of 34 \n \nFederal Government has granted the unauthorized alien lawful presence in the United \nStates or discretionary relief that authorizes the unauthorized alien to remain in the \nUnited States temporarily or permanently,โ or an โunauthorized alienโs entry into the \nUnited States did not constitute a violationโ of federal law. Id. ยง 811.102(4)(a), (c). \nThe second provision (the reentry provision) criminalizes the entry or presence \nof โunauthorized alien[s]โ in Florida where the federal government has โdenied admis-\nsion, excluded, deported, or removedโ the alien or where the alien โdeparted the United \nStates during the time an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding.โ \nId. ยง 811.103(1). Again, this provision follows federal law. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1326(a). And Flor-\nida provides that an alien does not violate the reentry provision where the alien has \nexpress permission to enter from the United States Attorney General or where such \npermission was not required under federal law. Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(1)(a)-(b). \nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiffs are two anonymous individuals and two organizations who claim to be \naffected by SB 4-C. DE1 ยถยถ 8-29. They sued Floridaโs Attorney General, the statewide \nprosecutor, and Floridaโs 20 state attorneys, but no law-enforcement officers. DE1. \nThey also sought to certify a class. DE5.  \nPlaintiffs contended that SB 4-C is preempted by federal law and violates the \nDormant Commerce Clause. DE1 ยถ 68-77. They moved for a temporary restraining \norder and a preliminary injunction, DE4, and the district court granted the restraining \norder ex parte, DE28. The court stated that its order โprohibit[ed] Defendants and their \n3 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 15 of 34 \n \nofficers, agents, employees, attorneys, and any person who [is] in active concert or par-\nticipation with them from enforcing SB 4-C.โ DE28 at 14. After learning of arrests by \nlaw-enforcement officers, DE50 at 6:5-18, the court clarified that its TRO also covered \nany โlaw enforcement officer with power to enforce SB 4-C,โ DE49 at 1.  \nThat court later granted a preliminary injunction. DE67. It held that SB 4-C was \nfield and conflict preempted, and violated the Dormant Commerce Clause. Id. at 14. It \nextended its order to all law-enforcement officers. Id. at 48.1  \nDefendants appealed. DE68. On April 30, Defendants moved for a stay of that \ninjunction, DE69, and the district courtโs delay in ruling on that motion amounts to a \nโfaile[ure] to afford the relief requested.โ  Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 952 F.3d 999, 1006 n.5 \n(9th Cir. 2020). \nARGUMENT \nThis Court may stay an injunction pending appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(2). In \nevaluating a stay request, the Court considers: (1) whether the applicant has shown a \nstrong likelihood of success on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether a stay will substantially injure the other parties; and \n(4) the public interest. League of Women Voters of Fla. v. Fla. Secโy of State, 32 F.4th 1363, \n1370 (11th Cir. 2022). Where the latter three factors โweigh[] heavily in favor of granting \n \n1 The district court set a show-cause hearing to evaluate whether the Attorney \nGeneral violated that order by expressing his legal position that the courtโs order could \nnot be lawfully extended to every Florida law-enforcement officer. DE67 at 48-49. \n4 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 16 of 34 \n \nthe stay,โ a stay may be โgranted upon a lesser showing of a โsubstantial case on the \nmerits.โโ Id. Because each factor favors Defendants, this Court should stay the injunc-\ntion or, at least, the scope of relief.  \nI.  DEFENDANTS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED IN OVERTURNING THE UNIVERSAL \nINJUNCTION. \nA.  Plaintiffs lack a cause of action to enforce federal immigration law.2  \nAt the outset, Plaintiffs have no โcause of actionโ to enforce the federal Immi-\ngration and Nationality Act (INA). Davis v. Passman, 442 U.S. 228, 239 (1979). They rely \nsolely on an equitable cause of action, DE1 at 13-14, which fails because the โfairest \nreadingโ of the INA shows that โCongress [has] displace[d]โ โequitable relief,โ and \nPlaintiffs โcannot, by invoking [courtsโ] equitable powers, circumventโ that statutory \nlimit. Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 328-29 (2015).  \nThe INAโs text bears that out. The statute charges the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity โwith the administration and enforcementโ of the INA unless another part \nโrelate[s] to the powers, functions, and duties conferred uponโ other Executive Branch \nofficers. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1103(a)(1). Some examples of carveouts are the federal bars on ille-\ngal entry and reentry, which provide for enforcement by particular federal officersโ\ncriminal and civil suits by a U.S. Attorney. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1329 (vesting enforcement in the \nU.S. Attorney for suits under โthis subchapterโ); see 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1324, 1326, 1330. \n \n2 Below, Defendants explained that Plaintiffs lack standing. See DE40 at 5-8. Due \nto space constraints, Defendants will reserve those arguments for their opening brief. \n5 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 17 of 34 \n \nBecause federal law โexpressly confers enforcement authority onโ specific federal of-\nficers, it โpreclud[es] enforcement byโ private plaintiffs. Corey v. Rockdale Cnty., No. 1:22-\ncv-3918, 2023 WL 6242669, at *5 (N.D. Ga. Aug. 28, 2023); see also Armstrong, 575 U.S. \nat 328 (similar). That congressional limit makes sense, as prosecution is a โcore execu-\ntive power.โ Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 219 (2020); see \nalso Safe Sts. All. v. Hickenlooper, 859 F.3d 865, 902-05 (10th Cir. 2017) (rejecting preemp-\ntion challenge to Coloradoโs marijuana laws under the Controlled Substances Act).  \nThe district court wrongly held that Congress displaced Plaintiffs only from pros-\necuting a person for crimes, not from enforcing implied preemption created by those \nsame provisions. DE67 at 12 n.8. To the court, Plaintiffs โdo[] not seek to enforce the \nINA, but seek[] to avoid prosecution under a state law preempted by the INA.โ Id. Yet \nimplied preemption stems from Congressโs โclear and manifest purposeโ in a statute to \ndisplace state law, and enforcing that purpose is enforcing the statuteโs rules. Arizona, \n567 U.S. at 400. After all, if the INA contained an express preemption provision, Plain-\ntiffs would be enforcing that provision by suing to preempt a state law; implied preemp-\ntion is an implicit version of that same scenario.  \nNor does the INA grant Plaintiffs privately enforceable, โpersonal rights.โ Gon-\nzaga Univ. v. Doe, 536 U.S. 273, 284-85 (2002). When suing in equity, the plaintiff must \ncome armed with a federal law endowing it with privately enforceable rights, see Safe Sts. \nAll., 859 F.3d at 902-04, bestowed โin clear and unambiguous terms,โ Gonzaga, 536 U.S. \nat 290. The only right Plaintiffs identify is the right not to be regulated because of \n6 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 18 of 34 \n \npreemption, but that is insufficient. For a statute to grant rights, โits text must be \nphrased in terms of the persons benefited.โ Id. at 284. If anything, the INA restricts \nPlaintiffsโ rights by criminalizing their conduct.  \nB.  SB 4-C is not preempted by federal immigration law. \nThis Court is also likely to reverse on the merits. The district court found that \nSB 4-C is facially field- and conflict-preempted. See DE67 at 22, 25. Under the standard \nfor Plaintiffsโ facial challenge, if any application of SB 4-C is not preempted, Plaintiffs \nlose. Salerno, 481 U.S. at 745.  \n1.  SB 4-C is not field preempted in all applications.  \nField preemption is a โrare case[.]โ Garcia, 589 U.S. at 208. To establish field \npreemption, Plaintiffs must identify a field fully occupied by federal law. Id. Then Plain-\ntiffs must show that SB 4-C operates within that field in every application. See Salerno, \n481 U.S. at 745. They fail at both steps. \n  a. To establish that a field is preempted, Plaintiffs must show that the โclear and \nmanifest purpose of Congressโ was a โcomplete ouster of state powerโ in that area. \nDeCanas v. Bica, 424 U.S. 351, 357 (1976). That โcan be inferred from a framework of \nregulation so pervasiveโ โthat Congress left no room for the States to supplement it,โ \nor a โfederal interestโ โso dominant that the federal system will be assumed to precludeโ \ncomplementary state laws. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 399. Because field preemption is strong \nmedicine, the field must be narrowly defined. See Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated Med. \nLabโys, 471 U.S. 707, 715-16 (1985).  \n7 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 19 of 34 \n \nAgainst that backdrop, the district court suggested that the INA preempts the \nfield of any โmovement of noncitizens.โ DE67 at 16. The statute does not support that \nsweeping vision of preemption. The district court relied on the supposed โcomprehen-\nsiveโ nature of the INA and amorphous federal interests. DE67 at 16-18. But all the \ndistrict court cited for that premise is โ[t]he INA defines and prohibits illegal entry and \nreentry.โ Id. That Congress has criminalized conduct far from shows that it also fore-\nclosed state laws. See Garcia, 589 U.S. at 212. Such a view would unwind countless over-\nlapping state crimes, from manufacture of narcotics to fraud and murder.  \nThe district courtโs analogy to alien registrationโthe sole field the Supreme \nCourt has held preempted by the INAโwas also inapt. DE67 at 16-17 (citing Arizona, \n567 U.S. at 400-02). The INAโs entry and reentry crimes are far less detailed than the \nalien-registration  provisions,  which  define  extensively  what,  when,  how,  and  with \nwhom aliens must register. Compare 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1325, 1326, with 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1301-06. \nThose provisions also uniquely limit enforcement of registration crimes to specific โper-\nson[s] authorizedโ by the โAttorney General.โ 8 U.S.C. ยง 1304(c). Unsurprisingly, the \nCourt has declined to extend Arizona. See Garcia, 589 U.S. at 210. \nRegardless, preemption may not be โinferred merely from the comprehensive \ncharacterโ of federal law alone. N.Y. State Depโt of Soc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 415 \n(1973).  In Arizona, the Court relied on both comprehensiveness and the unique federal \ninterests involved. See Arizona, 567 U.S. at 400-03. Plaintiffs do not identify any similarly \nunique federal interests in alien movement, nor do the ones in Arizona translate here. \n8 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 20 of 34 \n \nThere, registration of โperfectly law-abidingโ aliens created expectations about the \nโprotection of the just rights of a countryโs own nationals when those nationals are in \nanother country.โ Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 64-66 (1941). Those expectations \nstemmed from โobligationsโ under treaties and the โcustoms defining with more or \nless certainty the duties owing by all nations to alien residents.โ Id. at 65. But entry \ncrimes affect only non-law-abiding aliens. Id. at 64-66. The district court claimed that Ar-\nizona did not differentiate based on law-abiding status, DE67 at 20, but Arizona incor-\nporated the explanation in Hines, which did, for why Congress created alien-registration \nโas a harmonious whole.โ 567 U.S. at 401. \nGeorgia Latino Alliance for Human Rights v. Governor of Georgia, 691 F.3d 1250 (11th \nCir. 2012), does not hold otherwise. DE67 at 17. There, this Court held that the INA \npreempted the field of โtransportation, harboring, and inducement of unlawfully pre-\nsent aliens.โ Ga. Latino, 691 F.3d at 1266. But transporting and harboring are special \nbecause Congress has specifically limited state participation to arrest under federal law. \nId. at 1264 (citing 8 U.S.C. ยง 1324(c)). Though claiming that the INA similarly โcon-\nfin[es] the prosecution of [illegal entry and reentry] to federal court,โโ the district court \ncited nothing to support that conclusion. DE67 at 18. Nor could it, as the federal entry \nand reentry crimes contain nothing like Section 1324(c). If the district court was refer-\nring to the idea that federal crimes are prosecuted in federal court, that just describes \nthe consequences of โoverlapโ in criminal law. Garcia, 589 U.S. at 212.   \n9 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 21 of 34 \n \nb. Even if there were field preemption over alien entry and removal, SB 4-C is \nstill not preempted. State laws with only โsome indirect effectโ on that field โ[are] not \npre-empted.โ Schneidewind v. ANR Pipeline Co., 485 U.S. 293, 308 (1988). Floridaโs law \ndoes not directly operate in the field of alien entry in every application. See Salerno, 481 \nU.S. at 745. Nor does it regulate admission or the process of removal. SB 4-C faithfully \nrespects federal determinations that an alien may โremain in the United States tempo-\nrarily or permanently.โ Fla. Stat. ยง 811.102(4)(a). And where an alien travels unassisted \ninto Florida, it does not directly implicate the separate field of โprohibitions on the \ntransportationโ โof unlawfully present aliens,โ Ga. Latino, 691 F.3d at 1266, because \nsomeone other than the alien must provide that transportation.  \n2.  Plaintiffs have not shown that SB 4-C is conflict preempted in \nall applications. \nPlaintiffs have also not surmounted the โhigh thresholdโ for conflict preemp-\ntion. Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Whiting, 563 U.S. 582, 607 (2012) (plurality opinion). The \ndistrict court erroneously found that SB 4-C interferes with federal enforcement discre-\ntion. DE67 at 23.  \nProsecutorial discretion inheres in every criminal law, so that argument would \nunabashedly apply to every federal crime. Yet nothing about the โoverlapโ in federal \nand state criminal law demands preemption. Garcia, 589 U.S. at 212. And โthe possibility \nthat federal enforcement priorities might be upset is not enoughโ either. Id. Preemption \n10 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 22 of 34 \n \narises from โโthe Laws of the United States,โโ not federal officersโ โenforcement prior-\nities.โ Id.  \nGeorgia Latino is not to the contrary. That case dealt with โtransportationโ by \nother individuals โof unlawfully present aliensโโand this Court was concerned that \nstate enforcement of overlapping crimes would โthreaten the uniform application of \nthe INAโ and potentially implicate foreign-policy interests unmoored from the INAโs \ntext and structure. Ga. Latino, 691 F.3d at 1266. That reasoning defies Garcia and should \nnot be extended. See 589 U.S. at 202, 212. \nC.  SB 4-C does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.  \nThe Dormant Commerce Clause, at its โvery core,โ prevents economic discrim-\nination between states, Natโl Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 369 (2023), \nmeaning โmeasures [purposefully] designed to benefit in-state economic interests by \nburdening out-of-state competitors,โ id. Occasionally, courts look to a โmore ambi-\ntiousโ and disfavored theory to โsmoke out a hidden protectionism,โ id. at 371, 379, \ncomparing โthe burden imposed on interstate commerceโ to see if it is โclearly exces-\nsive in relation to the putative local benefits,โ id. at 377.  \nFloridaโs law has nothing to do with economic protectionism. It does not โben-\nefit in-state economic interests by burdening out-of-state competitors,โ id. at 369; it \nseeks to deter the influx of illegal aliens into Florida (no matter their residence) and \nprevent the many problems (social, moral, and criminal) that follow. The unnamed \nPlaintiffs prove that: Though they are Florida residents, they are subject to SB 4-C. And \n11 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 23 of 34 \n \nnothing โdisclose[s] purposeful discrimination against out-of-stateโ interests under the \nSupreme Courtโs balancing framework. Id. at 379.  \nThe district court cited Edwards v. California, 314 U.S. 160 (1941), to say that states \nmay not prohibit any crossing of state borders by individuals because it is โcommerce.โ \nDE67 at 25-26. But if that is commerce, Congress has affirmatively prohibited it, 8 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1324(a)(1)(A)(ii), 1325(a), and so the Dormant Commerce Clause does not \napply. United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, 332 (5th Cir. 2024) (Oldham, J., dissenting). \nStill more, the law in Edwards was clearly protectionist. It barred the transportation of \nโindigent non-residentsโ into Californiaโexpressly discriminating against out-of-state \neconomic interests. 314 U.S. at 174 (emphasis added).  \nD.  Alternatively, the district court lacked authority to bind Floridaโs \nlaw-enforcement officers, who are not parties. \nAt a minimum, this Court should narrow the scope of the injunction. See Order, \nGarcia v. Exec. Dir., Fla. Commโn on Ethics, No. 23-12663 (11th Cir. Nov. 30, 2023). Under \nRule 65, a courtโs order may โbind[] onlyโ those who receive โactual noticeโ and fall \ninto one of three categories: โ(A) the parties; (B) the partiesโ officers, agents, servants, \nemployees, and attorneys; and (C) other persons who are in active concert or participa-\ntion withโ the parties or their officers or agents. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2); see also United \nStates v. Robinson, 83 F.4th 868, 878 (11th Cir. 2023). That โembod[ies]โ the historic \nlimits of equity. ADT LLC v. NorthStar Alarm Servs., LLC, 853 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th \nCir. 2017). Traditionally, a litigant was โnot bound by a judgment to which she was not \n12 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 24 of 34 \n \na party,โ Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 888 (2008), ensuring that all persons โhave their \nday in court.โ Alemite, 42 F.2d at 832-33. \nBecause Plaintiffs have not shown that Florida law-enforcement officers fit those \ncriteria, the Court should narrow the injunction to cover only Defendants and those \nwho, as a matter of fact, aid or abet efforts by Defendants to violate the injunction. \n1. The first criterion is easy: โIt is undisputed that law enforcement agencies are \nnot named parties.โ DE67 at 38.  \n2. The second criterion also is not met. Law-enforcement officers are not De-\nfendantsโ โofficers, agents, servants, employees, [or] attorneys.โ Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2). \nThough Rule 65 does not define those terms, Congress presumptively โincorporate[d] \nthe established [common-law] meaning of these terms.โ Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence \nv. Reid, 490 U.S. 730, 739 (1989); see also Robinson, 83 F.4th at 880 (defining โemployeeโ \nin Rule 65 according to the common law). To fall within the common-law definitions \nof the categories in Rule 65(d)(2)(B), law-enforcement officers must be subject to De-\nfendantsโ control and wield authority to act on Defendantsโ behalf.3 Neither element is \nmet, because local law-enforcement agencies are independent from prosecutorial agen-\ncies under Floridaโs constitutional scheme. \n \n3 See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Agency ยงยง 2.01, 2.03 (Am. L. Inst. 2006) \n(agency); Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Darden, 503 U.S. 318, 322-23 (1992) (employees); \nClackamas Gastroenterology Assocs., P.C. v. Wells, 538 U.S. 440, 448 (2003) (servants); City \nof Tuscaloosa v. Harcros Chems., Inc., 158 F.3d 548, 557 n.9 (11th Cir. 1998) (officers). \n13 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 25 of 34 \n \nFlorida law makes that division clear. See Peppers v. Cobb County, 835 F.3d 1289, \n1294 (11th Cir. 2016) (Georgia district attorney was โa legal entity separate from the \nCountyโ because distinct constitutional provisions created those entities). In Florida, \nlaw-enforcement and prosecutorial agencies derive powers from separate constitu-\ntional4 and statutory5 sections. None of those sections grant Defendants control over \nlaw-enforcement officials, and Florida law is typically explicit when it grants such con-\ntrol. See Fla. Const. art. IV, ยง 4(b) (creating statewide prosecutor under the Attorney \nGeneralโs office); Fla. Stat. ยง 27.18 (permitting state attorneys to hire subordinates). \nFurther underscoring Defendantsโ lack of control, Defendants cannot remove or disci-\npline law-enforcement officers, nor do law-enforcement agencies draw their funds from \nDefendantsโ budgets. To top it off, many law-enforcement officers are elected by dif-\nferent constituencies, e.g., Fla. Const. art VIII, ยง 1(d) (sheriffs), or appointed by different \ngovernments, e.g., City of Miami Charter ch. 42, ยง 42-2 (police chief appointed by city \nmanager). This Court has thus recognized the separation between law-enforcement and \nprosecutorial entities in Florida. See City of South Miami v. Governor, 65 F.4th 631, 641 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (Florida Attorney General cannot โcontrolโ local law enforcement).  \n \n4 Compare Fla. Const. art. IV, ยง 4(b) (creating the Attorney General and statewide \nprosecutor); id. art. V, ยง 17 (creating state attorneys), with id. art. VIII, ยง 1(d) (creating \nsheriffs). \n5 See, e.g., Fla. Stat. ยง 16.01 (Attorney General); Fla. Stat. ยงยง 27.02-.13, 27.18-.25 \n(state attorneys); Fla. Stat. ยง 30.15 (sheriffs); Fla. Stat. ยง 943.04(2)(a) (Florida Depart-\nment of Law Enforcement); Fla. Stat. ยง 321.05 (Florida Highway Patrol); see also City of \nMiami Charter ยง 24 (Miami Police Department). \n14 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 26 of 34 \n \nThe district court held that, despite the lack of legal control, Defendants exercised \nenough โpractical[]โ control over law-enforcement entities to make them Defendantsโ \nโagents.โ DE67 at 38-41. But it is the โright to control,โ not practical control, that \ndefines the agency relationship. General Bldg. Contractors v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 393-\n95 (1982). So practical sway over local officials does not matter. If such indirect control \nestablished agency, every law-enforcement officer could bind the Attorney General to \ncontracts, Restatement (Third) of Agency ยง 6.01, or subject him to liability under re-\nspondeat superior, id. ยง 7.07. That is not the law. Cf. State v. Spradlin, 12 S.W.3d 432, 434 \n(Tenn. 2000) (โ[p]olice officersโ lack โauthority to bind the [] attorney generalโ โnot to \nprosecuteโ).  \nIn any event, the district courtโs evidence of practical control was weak. First, the \ncourt thought that the Attorney Generalโs โpower to file suitโ against local officials \nestablished sufficient control. DE67 at 39 n.24. This Court rejected that premise in \nJacobson v. Florida Secretary of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1253 (11th Cir. 2020) (โThat the Sec-\nretary must resort to judicial process if the Supervisors fail to perform their duties un-\nderscores her lack of authority over them.โ).  \nNext, the district court cited the Attorney Generalโs tweets discussing โdirec-\ntion[s]โ he has given to law-enforcement officials. DE67 at 39-40. Those directions, of \ncourse, recognize a partnership between law enforcement and the Attorney General, \nbut they establish no โright to control.โ General Bldg. Contractors, 458 U.S. at 393-95. \nPlus, most of those tweets involved law-enforcement agencies headed by a multi-\n15 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 27 of 34 \n \nmember board on which the Attorney General sits. See Fla. Stat. ยง 20.201 (Florida De-\npartment of Law Enforcement); Fla. Stat. ยง 20.24 (Florida Highway Patrol). In context, \nthe tweets at most reflect that the Attorney General may direct law enforcement when \nacting on a controlling board. That does not give him control over those agencies in his \nsingular capacity. See Support Working Animals v. Governor of Fla., 8 F.4th 1198, 1204 & \nn.4 (11th Cir. 2021). \nFinally, the district court noted that the Attorney General is Floridaโs โchief legal \nofficer,โ and that Florida courts give his opinions โcareful consideration.โ DE67 at 40-\n41. Yet as the district court acknowledged in the same breath, the Attorney Generalโs \nopinions are โnot binding.โ Id.  \n3. Nor are law-enforcement officers invariably in โactive concert or participa-\ntionโ with Defendants. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C); ADT, 853 F.3d at 1352. โ[A] court \nof equityโ โcannot lawfully enjoin the world at large,โ and due process entitles each \nperson to โtheir day in court.โ Alemite, 42 F.2d at 832-33. Non-parties thus fall within \nthe โactive concert or participationโ exception in two โlimitedโ circumstances: when \nthey are in โprivityโ with a party, or when they โaid and abet the partyโ to violate the \ninjunction. Robinson, 83 F.4th at 881-82.  \na. Law-enforcement officers lack privity with Defendants. โ[P]rivityโ exists only \nwhen a non-party โcan be legally identified with an enjoined party,โ such that enjoining \nthe non-party comports with due process. Robinson, 83 F.4th at 884. That designation is \nreserved for a Defendantโs โsuccessors and assignsโ (inapplicable here) and those with \n16 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 28 of 34 \n \nwhom Defendants share a โlegal identity.โ Id. To share legal identity, the non-party \nmust have both (1) โa very close identity of interestโ with the party, and (2) exercise \nโsuch significant control over the [party] and the underlying litigation that it is fair to \nsay that the nonparty had his day in court.โ Id. That โlimited classโ prevents a party \nfrom โcircumvent[ing] a valid court order merely by making superficial changesโ in \nform. Id. at 884-85.  \nIt is elemental that law-enforcement officers do not exercise โsignificant control \nover the [Defendants]โ or control over โ[this] litigation.โ Robinson, 83 F.4th at 884; see \nsupra 14-16. They are separate constitutional entities, and law enforcement in Florida \ncannot issue binding directives to prosecutors. Plaintiffs have never argued otherwise.  \nPlaintiffs have not shown a sufficient identity of interests either. Law-enforce-\nment officers are interested in arresting and โprevention and detection of crime,โ Fla. \nStat. ยง 943.10(1), whereas state attorneys and Attorneys General are concerned with \nprosecution and legal process. That latter role implicates โtheir status as officers of the \ncourt,โ Valdes v. State, 728 So. 2d 736, 739 (Fla. 1999), in which they โrepresent the \ninterests of the people of the State of Florida, not the interests of [an] arresting police \nofficer.โ Gentile v. Bauder, 718 So. 2d 781, 783 (Fla. 1998). For that reason, a host of \ncourts hold that prosecutors are not in privity with arresting officers. This Court has \nheld, for example, that a sheriff, โneither individually nor as sheriff,โ โshared an identity \nof interestโ with the โprosecutor in [a] criminal case.โ Wilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227, \n1237 (11th Cir. 1985). \n17 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 29 of 34 \n \nb. Next, there is no evidence of aiding and abetting. Such a showing requires \n(1) โthe commission of the underlying offense by someoneโ other than the abettor, \n(2) โa voluntary act or omissionโ by the abettor, and (3) โa specific intent that such act \nor omission promote the success of the underlying criminal offense.โ Havens v. James, \n76 F.4th 103, 115 n.13 (2d Cir. 2023); see also United States v. Roosevelt Coats, 8 F.4th 1228, \n1248 (11th Cir. 2021). Under Rule 65, the underlying offense is a violation of the in-\njunction, which requires that the enjoined party or its agents take some affirmative โact[] \nin violation of the injunction.โ Robinson, 83 F.4th at 885.  \nHere, there is no evidence that Defendants have taken or will take any โact[] in \nviolation of the injunction.โ Id. Defendants are fully committed to abiding by the district \ncourtโs orders while they challenge them. So there is no โunderlying crimeโ to abet. \nRosemond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70 (2014).   \nc. Despite this Courtโs instructions in Robinson and ADT, the district court en-\ngaged with none of that analysis. It simply forged its own test for whether parties are \nacting in concert or participation. DE67 at 42 (asking whether there was โa purposeful \nacting of two or more persons together or toward the same endโ or โa purposeful acting \nof one in accord with the ends of the otherโ). That defies precedent.  \nCompounding the problem, the district court erred under its own standard. It \nreasoned that law-enforcement officers โpurposeful[ly] act[] . . . together or toward the \nsame endโ as the named Defendants because they โconduct arrestsโ so that prosecutors \nmay โprosecute charges.โ DE67 at 42. But Florida prosecutors are enjoined from \n18 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 30 of 34 \n \nprosecuting crimes under SB 4-C, so prosecutors may not work โtogetherโ with โor \ntoward the same endโ as law enforcement to enforce SB 4-C. Id. Even more, the district \ncourtโs  underlying  premiseโthat  arrests  are  merely  precursors  to  prosecutionโis \nwrong. Officers may arrest โfor a wide variety of purposes,โ like deterrence or public \nsafety, even if those purposes are โwholly unrelated to a desire to prosecute for crime.โ \nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 13 (1968). \nThe court also incorrectly asserted that privity between state officials is irrelevant \nwhen suing โstate officials in their official capacitiesโ because such suits are โno differ-\nent from a suit against the State.โ DE67 at 45 n.31. The entire point of Ex Parte Young \nis that suits against state officials are different than suits against the State. See Va. Off. for \nProt. & Advoc. v. Stewart, 563 U.S. 247, 255 (2011) (Suit against a state official could \nproceed because โhe is not the State.โ). Were it otherwise, a plaintiff would need stand-\ning to sue just one state actor to open the spigot to injunctive relief against all state \nactors. That ignores Jacobson, Support Working Animals, and City of South Miami, which \nteach that a plaintiffs may not obtain relief against โindependent officialsโ merely by \nsuing one state officer. Jacobson, 974 F.3d at 1253. \nLast, the district courtโs understanding of state-actor litigation flouts traditional \nnotions of claim preclusion. Privity in this context is the same as privity in the res-\njudicata context. ADT, 853 F.3d at 1352. On the district courtโs understanding of priv-\nity, though, rulings against one state actor would bind in future cases against all state \n19 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 31 of 34 \n \nactors. This Court has rejected that view. See Hercules Carriers, Inc. v. Claimant State of Fla., \nDepโt of Transp., 768 F.2d 1558, 1580 (11th Cir. 1985).  \nII.  THE REMAINING EQUITABLE FACTORS SUPPORT A STAY. \nThe equities favor a stay. โAny time a State is enjoined by a court from effectu-\nating statutes enacted by representatives of its people, it suffers a form of irreparable \ninjury.โ Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) (Roberts, C.J., in chambers). Even \nmore so when a law regulates โharmful, constitutionally unprotected conduct.โ Virginia \nv. Hicks, 539 U.S. 113, 119 (2003).  \nPlaintiffs also have unclean hands. Precision Instrument Mfg. Co. v. Auto. Maint. \nMach. Co., 324 U.S. 806, 814 (1945) (โ[H]e who comes into equity must come with clean \nhands.โ). They seek to protect illegal conduct, such as driving without a license or work-\ning without authorization. DE4-4 ยถยถ 8โ9 (VV); DE4-5 ยถ 7 (YM); DE4-2 ยถ 20 (WA). \nThat they cannot do. See Shondel v. McDermott, 775 F.2d 859, 868 (7th Cir. 1985).  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should stay the injunction or, at minimum, stay it insofar as the in-\njunction applies to law-enforcement officers. \n \n \n \n \n \n20 \n\nUSCA11 Case: 25-11469     Document: 6     Date Filed: 05/07/2025     Page: 32 of 34 \n \nDated: May 7, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n  JAMES UTHMEIER \n    Attorney General of Florida \n   \n  /s/ Robert S.

DE 67 at 48 (citing DE 28, 49).  In the two orders \ncomprising the TRO, the Court enjoined the Attorney General in two respects.  First, the Court \nordered him not to enforce sections 811.102 and 811.103, Florida Statutes (โSB 4-Cโ).  See DE 28 \nat 14 (โprohibiting โฆ enforcing SB 4-Cโ); DE 49 at 1 (โprohibited from enforcing SB 4-Cโ).  The \nAttorney General has not enforced those laws since the Court entered the TRO.  Second, the Court \nordered the Attorney General to โprovide actual notice of the TROโ to thousands of non-partiesโ\nnamely, โany officer or other personnel within any municipal or county police department within \nFlorida, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, or the Florida Highway Patrol, and any other \nlaw enforcement officer with power to enforce SB4-C.โ  DE 49 at 1โ2.  The Attorney General \nprovided such notice.  Having complied with the Courtโs TRO, there is no basis for contempt or \nsanctions. \nThe Courtโs show-cause order points to the Attorney Generalโs April 23 letter, which the \nCourt describes as โadvising [the non-parties], in part, that โno lawful, legitimate order currently \nimpedes [the non-parties] from continuing to enforceโ S.B. 4-C.โ  DE 67 at 48 (partially quoting \nDE 57-1).  But the elided quote in the show-cause order does not fairly reflect the April 23 letter \nin context.  Pursuant to the Courtโs TRO, the Attorney General had previously sent a letter to all \nlaw enforcement in the stateโthousands of officersโalerting these non-parties for the first time \nto their inclusion in the Courtโs injunctive relief.  In that first letter, the Attorney General noted \nthat he believes the Court erred by including non-parties in its order and that he would be further \nbriefing the issue.  The Attorney General filed that brief on April 23, see DE 56, and then sent the \nApril 23 letter updating the thousands of non-party officers who, despite being enjoined through \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 3 of 20\nthese proceedings, are otherwise not receiving any notice about them.  In that letter, the Attorney \nGeneral explained โ[his] viewโ of the law โ[a]s set forth in the brief [his] office filedโ in this Court.  \nDE 57-1.   \nNone of this violated the only two clear commands in the TRO: that the Attorney General \n(i) shall not enforce SB 4-C, and (ii) shall provide notice of the TRO to thousands of non-party \nlaw enforcement officers.  The TRO did not prohibitโmuch less clearly prohibitโthe Attorney \nGeneral from (i) holding a legal view contrary to the conclusions reached by this Court, (ii) filing \na brief explaining his legal position, (iii) notifying others of the filing of that brief, or (iv) publicly \nexplaining  the  position  or  reasoning  in  that  brief.    Interpreting  the  TRO  to  include  such \nprohibitions, and then basing a contempt finding on that interpretation, would violate the rule that \ncontempt exists only when a party clearly violates a clear order.  Interpreting an order to prohibit \na state attorney general from disagreeing with a federal orderโwhile following itโwould also be \nan  extraordinary,  first-of-its-kind  assertion  of  federal  judicial  power,  implicating  grave \nconstitutional concerns.  See U.S. CONST. AMENDS. 1, 10. \nBACKGROUND \n  The named Defendants are the Attorney General of Florida, the statewide prosecutor, and \neach state judicial circuitโs independently elected state attorney.  On April 4, 2025, this Court \nentered  a  temporary  restraining  order  โprohibiting  Defendants  and  their  officers,  agents, \nemployees, attorneys, and any person[s] who are in active concert or participation with them from \nenforcingโ SB 4-C.  DE 28 at 14.  After a hearing on April 18, 2025, the Court issued an order \nfinding that the โTRO shall be interpreted to include,โ as โprohibited from enforcing SB 4-C,โ tens \nof thousands of non-partiesโnamely, โany officer or other personnel with any municipal or county \npolice department within Florida, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, or the Florida \nHighway Patrol, and any other law enforcement officer with power to enforce SB 4-C.โ  DE 49 at \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 4 of 20\n1.1  The April 18 order required Defendants to โprovide actual notice of the TROโ to their own \nโofficers, agents, employees, [and] attorneys,โ as well as the thousands of non-parties included in \nthe order.  Id. at 2.  The Court also ordered supplemental briefing on โthe proper scope of the \nTRO/PI.โ  Id.  \n  Complying with the Courtโs directive, the Attorney General immediately sent a letter to all \nlaw enforcement agencies in Florida (โApril 18 Letterโ) informing them of the TRO and this \nCourtโs โclarification that law enforcement officers should take no steps to enforce Sections \n811.102 and 811.103, including through arrests or detentions.โ  DE 57-2 at 2.  In that letter, the \nAttorney General also explained his position that the TRO โis both wrong on the merits and \noverbroad in its scope.โ  Id. at 1.  He noted that his office would โcontinue to press these scope-\nof-relief arguments in the district court and, as appropriate, in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nEleventh Circuit.โ  Id. \nOn April 23, 2025, the Attorney General filed his supplemental brief, in which he argued \nthat the Court โlacks equitable authority to enjoinโ non-parties to the case and that the TRO is \ntherefore โoverbroadโ and may only extend, at most, to non-party law enforcement officers who \nโaid and abetโ Defendants in violating the injunction.  DE 56 at 2, 15.  That same day, the Attorney \nGeneral sent a follow-up letter (โApril 23 Letterโ) updating the law enforcement agencies that his \noffice had filed the supplemental brief.  DE 57-1.  In that letter, the Attorney General reiterated \nthat the Court interpreted the TRO to reach โall law enforcement agencies in Florida.โ  Id.  But he \nalso explained the position โset forth in the brief [his] office filedโโi.e., that enjoining thousands \nof non-parties across the state is โwrongโ and therefore the order was not โlawful.โ  The Attorney \n \n1 As of 2024, municipal police departments in Florida employed 20,225 officers, and \ncounty sheriffs employed 23,407 officers.  See Fla. Dept. of L. Enforcement, Criminal Justice \nAgency Profile Report, https://www.   fdle.state.fl.us/C      JSTC/Publications/CJAP/Statewide-Ratios. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 5 of 20\nGeneral explained that he would โcontinue to argue that positionโ in Court.  Id.  The Attorney \nGeneral explained his view that, under state law, he (as opposed to the Court) โcannot prevent \n[other law enforcement agencies] from enforcing ยงยง 811.102 and 811.103.โ  Id. \nOn April 29, after the Attorney General sent the April 23 Letter, this Court entered an \nOmnibus Order providing the Courtโs reasoning for including thousands of non-party municipal \nand county law enforcement officers within the scope of its injunction.  DE 67 at 37โ47.  The \nCourt  concluded  that  these  thousands  of  local  officersโthough  independently  elected  or \nappointedโare agents of the Attorney General, and he has โcontrolโ and โstructural authorityโ \nover them, id. at 41, because:  \nโข  of the possibility of โremovalโ of state, county, or municipal officers under section \n908.107, Florida Statutes (despite the removal authority being vested solely in the \nGovernor), id. at 39; \nโข  there are โmultiple posts on AG Uthmeierโs social media, directing state law \nenforcement agencies โฆ to act,โ id. at 39โ40; \nโข  the Attorney General is one member of the four-member Commission that controls \nthe Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol by \nmajority vote, id. at 40โ41; and \nโข  the Attorney General may give โan official opinion and legal adviceโ that is โnot \nbindingโ on Florida officials or courts, id. at 41.2 \nIn that same Omnibus Order, which for the first time explained the Courtโs theory of the \nAttorney Generalโs โcontrolโ and โauthorityโ over every law enforcement officer in Florida, the \nCourt ordered the Attorney General to โshow cause why he should not be held in contempt or \nsanctioned for violating the TRO (DE 28; DE 49) through sending his April 23, 2025 letter to law \nenforcement agencies in Florida.โ  Id. at 48.  The Court characterized the April 23 Letter as a \nโmisstatementโ and an โactive effort to counsel law enforcement.โ  Id. at 40 n.25. \n \n2 The Omnibus Order does not cite any state or federal case reaching this same conclusion \nregarding the scope of the Florida Attorney Generalโs authority.   \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 6 of 20\nARGUMENT \nA federal district court must exercise its contempt power with extreme caution.  As the \nSupreme Court has explained: \n[T]he contempt power โฆ is liable to abuse.  Unlike most areas of law, where a \nlegislature defines both the sanctionable conduct and the penalty to be imposed, \ncivil  contempt  proceedings  leave  the  offended  judge  solely  responsible  for \nidentifying, prosecuting, adjudicating, and sanctioning the contumacious conduct.  \nContumacy often strikes at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judgeโs \ntemperament, and its fusion of legislative, executive, and judicial powers summons \nforth ... the prospect of the most tyrannical licentiousness. \nIntโl Union, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Bagwell, 512 U.S. 821, 831 (1994) (quotation marks \nand citations omitted).  Civil contempt is thus a โpotent weapon,โ Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. \n554, 560 (2019), and when โit is founded upon a decree too vague to be understood, it can be a \ndeadly one,โ Intโl Longshoremenโs Assโn, Local 1291 v. Phila. Marine Trade Assโn, 389 U.S. 64, \n76 (1967) (alteration omitted).  \nTo guard against the risks of judicial overreach, Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure requires an injunction to โdescribe in reasonable detail โฆ the act or acts restrained or \nrequired.โ  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1)(C).  โ[T]hose enjoinedโ must โreceive explicit notice of \nprecisely what conduct is outlawedโ before they can be subject to contempt.  Schmidt v. Lessard, \n414 U.S. 473, 476 (1974).  Thus, an โinjunction must be framed so that those enjoined know \nexactly what conduct the court has prohibited and what steps they must take to conform their \nconduct to the law.โ  S.E.C. v. Smyth, 420 F.3d 1225, 1233 n.14 (11th Cir. 2005) (quoting Fla. \nAssโn of Rehab. Facilities, Inc. v. Fla. Depโt of Health and Rehab. Servs., 225 F.3d 1208, 1222โ23 \n(11th Cir. 2000)).  To that end, courts have consistently held that a โperson enjoined by court order \nshould only be required to look within the four corners of the injunction to determine what he must \ndo or refrain from doing.โ  S.E.C. v. Goble, 682 F.3d 934, 952 (11th Cir. 2012) (quoting Hughey v. \nJMS Dev. Corp, 78 F.3d 1523, 1531 (11th Cir. 1996)); see, e.g., Monsanto Co. v. Haskel Trading, \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 7 of 20\nInc., 13 F. Supp.2d 349, 363 (E.D.N.Y. 1998) (โThe clarity of the order must be such that it enables \nthe enjoined party โto ascertain from the four comers of the order precisely what acts are \nforbidden.โโ (quoting Drywall Tapers & Pointers of Greater N.Y., Local 1974 v. Local 530 of \nOperative Plasterers & Cement Masons Intโl Assโn, 889 F.2d 389, 395 (2d Cir. 1989))).   \nUnder that standard, โcivil contempt โshould not be resorted to where there is [a] fair \nground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the defendantโs conduct.โโ  Taggart, 587 U.S. at 561 \n(quoting Cal. Artificial Stone Paving Co. v. Molitor, 113 U.S. 609, 618 (1885)).  This โrigorousโ \nstandard, see In re Roth, 935 F.3d 1270, 1278 (11th Cir. 2019), permits civil contempt only if โthere \nis no objectively reasonable basis for concluding that [the defendantโs] conduct might be lawful,โ \nTaggart, 587 U.S. at 561.  Or, said differently, civil contempt will not lie when there is โan \nobjectively reasonable basis to believeโ that the courtโs order did not bar the alleged โconduct.โ  In \nre Grant-Carmack, No. 23-11817, 2024 WL 1433714, at *4 (11th Cir. Apr. 3, 2024).  Civil \ncontempt is thus โunavailableโ and โinappropriateโ if there is a โfair ground of doubt as to whether \nthe [courtโs] order barred [the partyโs] conduct.โ  Roth, 935 F.3d at 1278 (quotation marks omitted); \nsee also Trade Well Intโl v. United Cent. Bank, 778 F.3d 620, 626 (7th Cir. 2015) (contempt requires \nโan unequivocal command which the party in contempt violatedโ (quoting Maรฑez v. Bridgestone \nFirestone  N. Am.  Tire,  LLC,  533  F.3d  578,  591  (7th  Cir.  2008))).    โ[A]ny  ambiguities  or \nuncertainties in โฆ a court order must be read in a light favorable to the person charged with \ncontempt.โ  Project B.A.S.I.C. v. Kemp, 947 F.2d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 1991); see also Ford v. Kammerer, \n450 F.2d 279, 280 (3d Cir. 1971) (โ[A]mbiguities and omissions in orders redound to the benefit \nof the person charged with contempt.โ); Ga. Power Co. v. NLRB, 484 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir. \n2007) (same).   \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 8 of 20\nThis demanding standard precludes contempt here.  The TRO had one prohibitory element \nand one mandatory element.  First, it prohibited the Attorney General from enforcing SB 4-C.  DE \n28 at 14; DE 49 at 1โ2.  He has not enforced SB 4-C since the issuance of the TRO.  DE 71 at \n23:11โ13.  Second, the TRO required the Attorney General to provide written notice of the TRO \nto all law enforcement officers in Florida.  DE 49 at 2.  The Attorney General has done so.  DE 57-\n2.  But nothing in the TRO prohibitedโmuch less clearly prohibitedโthe Attorney General from \nholding a legal opinion contrary to the Courtโs conclusion, filing a brief in favor of his contrary \nlegal conclusion, or alerting others that he holds such a view and filed a brief expressing that view.  \nAnd that is all the April 23 Letter represents: the Attorney Generalโs explanation of his contrary \nview and notice that he filed a brief expressing that view.  To find contempt by reading more into \nthe Courtโs TRO, or into the April 23 Letter, would violate both the contempt standard and raise \nserious constitutional questions.3 \nI.  The April 23 Letter Did Not Violate the Temporary Restraining Order Because It Did \nNot Enforce SB 4-C.  \nโIn  determining  whether  a  particular  act  falls  within  the  scope  of  an  injunctionโs \nprohibition, particular emphasis must be given to the express terms of the order.โ  Alley v. U.S. \nDepโt of Health & Hum. Servs., 590 F.3d 1195, 1207 (11th Cir. 2009) (quoting Ala. Nursing Home \nAssโn v. Harris, 617 F.2d 385, 388 (5th Cir. 1980)).  The TROโs first express requirement was to \n \n3 The Attorney General has appealed the underlying preliminary injunction.  DE 68.  If the \nAttorney General succeeds on appeal, that may independently vitiate any contempt.  E.g., Belize \nTelecom, Ltd. v. Govโt of Belize, 528 F.3d 1298, 1310 (11th Cir. 2008) (โA judgment of civil \ncontempt ... stands or falls with the validity or invalidity of the order.โ); McLean v. Cent. States, \nSe. & Sw. Areas Pension Fund, 762 F.2d 1204, 1210 (4th Cir. 1985) (โ[R]eversal of the underlying \norder ordinarily invalidates any civil contempt sanctions predicated thereon.โ); United States v. \nBayshore Assocs., Inc., 934 F.2d 1391, 1398 (6th Cir. 1991) (considering the propriety of contempt \nfor violating a TRO in an appeal from the preliminary injunction); United States v. Spectro Foods \nCorp.,  544  F.2d  1175,  1179  (3d  Cir.  1976)  (similar).   Accordingly,  the Attorney  General \nincorporates his merits arguments here.  \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 9 of 20\nprohibit Defendants from enforcing SB 4-C.  See DE 28 at 14 (โThe Court enters a TRO prohibiting \nDefendants and their officers, agents, employees attorneys, and any person[s] who are in active \nconcern or participation with them from enforcing SB 4-C.โ); DE 49 at 1 (โThe Temporary \nRestraining Order (โTROโ) (DE 28) is extended and shall remain in effect through April 29, 2025 \nat 5:00 p.m. or until further order of the Court.โ).  The Attorney General fully complied with that \nprohibition.  Since the entry of the TRO, he has not enforced SB 4-C, and there is no contrary \nevidence in the record.  \nThe Court has raised the possibility that the April 23 Letter constituted enforcement \nbecause it represents an โactive effort to counsel law enforcementโ that โthe order does not \nโproperlyโ restrain them.โ  DE 67 at 40 n.25.  That suggestion is mistaken for several reasons. \n1.  The Courtโs proffered reading of the April 23 Letter relies on one portion of one \nsentence, rather than reading letter as a whole and in the context of what preceded it: the April 18 \nLetter and the brief the Attorney General filed earlier on April 23.  In the April 18 Letter, which \nwas ordered by the Court, the Attorney General provided notice to the Florida law enforcement \ncommunityโthe thousands of officers who are not parties and who were enjoined without prior \nnoticeโof the existence of the TRO.  Because the Attorney General does not lead or control those \nagencies, he requested each agency to โ[p]lease instruct your officers and agents to comply with \nJudge Williamโs directives.โ  DE 57-2 at 2.  And because the April 18 Letter was the first notice \nthese agencies received about the lawsuitโand their addition to it as enjoined entitiesโthe \nAttorney  General  also explained  his  litigating  position.    He  informed  the  agencies  that  he \nโdisagree[s] with this orderโ because it is โoverbroad in its scope,โ and stated that he will โcontinue \nto press these scope-of-relief arguments in the district court.โ  Id. at 1. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 10 of 20\nAs part of the TRO, the Court ordered the Attorney General to file supplemental briefing \non โthe proper scope of the TRO/PI by April 23, 2023 at 12:00 p.m.โ  DE 49 at 2.  The Attorney \nGeneral timely filed his brief on April 23, arguing that the TRO was โunlawfulโ and that the Court \nlacked โequitable authority to enjoin all non-party law enforcement officers with power to enforce \nSB 4-C.โ  DE 56 at 2, 15 (quotation marks and alteration omitted).  But the hundreds of agencies \nand thousands of officers enjoined by the Court did not receive that filing because, again, they are \nnot parties.  So, to keep them informed, the Attorney General sent a follow up letter after he filed \nhis brief on April 23.   \nIn the April 23 Letter, the Attorney General expressly reiterated the Courtโs conclusion that \nthe TRO โboundโ the letterโs recipients.  DE 57-1.  He explainedโas he had in the April 18 \nLetterโthat he believed the Courtโs conclusion as to permissible scope of the TRO was โwrong,โ \nand he noted that the April 18 Letter had promised his โoffice would be arguing as much in short \norder.โ  Id.  He then informed the letterโs recipients: โToday, my office filed a brief explaining \nwhyโ the Courtโs order was impermissible in its scope.  The next (and final) four sentences of the \nletterโwhich the Court partially quoted in its show-cause order and at a prior hearing, DE 67 at \n40 n.25; DE 71 at 23:24โ24:6; 25:15โ26:1โread as follows: \nThat said, I want to make clear what I expressed in my April 18 letter. Judge \nWilliams ordered my office to notify you of the evolving scope of her order, and I \ndid so.  But I cannot prevent you from enforcing ยงยง 811.102 and 811.103, where \nthere remains no judicial order that properly restrains you from doing so.  As set \nforth in the brief my office filed today, it is my view that no lawful, legitimate order \ncurrently impedes your agencies from continuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal \nentry and reentry laws. \nDE 57-1.   \nIn the context of the April 18 Letter that preceded it, the paragraph that precedes it, and the \nvery language of the paragraph (โAs set forth in the brief my office filed today, it is my view โฆโ), \nthe paragraph cannot be fairly read as the Attorney General โcounsel[ing] law enforcementโ to \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 11 of 20\nenforce SB 4-C, DE 67 at 40 n.25.  Instead, it is the Attorney General explaining (1) his view that \nhe does not have authority under state law to โpreventโ independent agencies from taking actions, \nand (2) that while the TRO prohibits them from enforcing the law, โit is [his] viewโโโ[a]s set \nforth in [his] briefโโthat the scope of the order is neither โlawfulโ nor โlegitimate.โ  DE 57-1.  In \nother words, the last paragraph of the April 23 Letter explains (i) the legal views the Attorney \nGeneral expressed in his brief, and (ii) the scope of his authority, as opposed to the Courtโs \nauthority.  Advising law enforcement in this manner was entirely reasonable given that (i) these \nnon-parties are not receiving any other type of notice from the Court or Plaintiffs as to what is \noccurring in this case, but are nonetheless now bound by its edicts; (ii) the Attorney General had \npreviously stated another brief would be forthcoming; and (iii) these non-parties might have \nquestions as to the source of the prohibition on their actions (the Court versus the Attorney \nGeneral).   \n2.  Nothing in the April 23 Letter comports with the common understanding of โenforce.โ  \nThat phrase in the TRO โmust be read and interpreted objectively.โ  United States v. Scruggs, No. \n2:07-cr-325, DE 34 at 22 (N.D. Ala. Feb. 29, 2008).  Indeed, โunbroken lines of authorityโ caution \ncourts โto read court decrees to mean rather precisely what they say.โ  NBA Props., Inc. v. Gold, \n895 F.2d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1990) (Breyer, J.).  Said otherwise, in โdetermining whether a party is in \ncontempt of a court order, the order is subject to reasonable interpretation.โ  Riccard v. Prudential \nIns. Co., 307 F.3d 1277, 1296 (11th Cir. 2002).  And in engaging in that reasonable interpretation, \ncourts must โconstrue any ambiguities or uncertainties ... โin a light favorable to the person charged \nwith contempt.โ  Ga. Power Co., 484 F.3d at 1291. \nTo โenforceโ means to โgive force or effect to (a law, etc.).โ  Enforce, Blackโs Law \nDictionary (12th ed. 2024); see also Enforce, Websterโs Third New International Dictionary (2002 \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 12 of 20\ned.) (โto put into force; to cause to take effect; give effect to esp. with vigor <laws>โ); e.g., \nScruggs, No. 2:07-cr-325, DE 34 at 23 (looking to dictionary to define the scope of an injunction).  \nEnforcement, in other words, โtypically involves compulsion or constraint.โ  K.P. v. LeBlanc, 627 \nF.3d 115, 124 (5th Cir. 2010).  State officials thus โenforceโ a law when โthey clearly ... assisted \nor currently assist in giving effect to the contested law.โ  Free Speech Coal., Inc. v. Anderson, 119 \nF.4th 732, 736 (10th Cir. 2024) (quotation marks and alteration omitted).  By contrast, state \nofficials do not enforce the law by promulgating it, see Mi Familia Vota v. Abbott, 977 F.3d 461, \n467โ68 (5th Cir. 2020), advocating for it, see Support Working Animals, Inc. v. Governor of Fla., \n8 F.4th 1198, 1203โ04 (11th Cir. 2021), or issuing written opinions on its scope or effect, see Free \nSpeech Coal., Inc. v. Anderson, 685 F. Supp. 3d 1299, 1304 (D. Utah 2023).   \nThe common thread running through these decisions is that commenting about a lawโ\neven strongly, and even in legally relevant waysโdoes not enforce the law.  For example, in \nSouthern Pacific Transp. Co. v. Brown, 651 F.2d 613 (1980), the Ninth Circuit held that the Oregon \nAttorney General did not โenforceโ an Oregon law by โadvis[ing] Oregon district attorneys to \npresume the [law] constitutionalโโeven if โhis opinion might be persuasiveโโbecause the \nAttorney General had no authority under state law to โcompel the district attorneys to prosecute or \nrefrain from doing so.โ  Id. at 614โ15 (observing district attorneys could โreject[]โ the Attorney \nGeneralโs โadviceโ). \nHere, then, the April 23 Letter did not enforce SB 4-C.  The Attorney General did not direct \nlaw enforcement officials to do anything.  Nor did he compel law enforcement officials to do \nanything.  See K.P., 627 F.3d at 124.  Rather, he explained his โview ... [a]s set forth in the brief \n[his] office filed.โ  DE 57-1.  That is not enforcement.  E.g., United States v. Abbott, 85 F.4th 328, \n335 (5th Cir. 2023) (โpublic statementsโ are not enforcement); Tex. Democratic Party v. Abbott, \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 13 of 20\n978 F.3d 168, 181 (5th Cir. 2020) (State Attorney General sending a letter to other state officials \noutlining his view of the law did not โintimate that formal enforcement was on the horizonโ \n(quotation marks and alteration omitted)); Brown, 651 F.2d at 615 (no enforcement where State \nAttorney Generalโs โadviceโ was not โbindingโ on district attorneys); Chrysafis v. James, 534 F. \nSupp. 3d 272, 298 (E.D.N.Y. 2021) (โPlaintiffs cite no authority, nor did the Court find any, for \nthe proposition that an officialโs public statements and guidance to other state officials are \nsufficient to establish either the officialโs authority to enforce a law or her willingness to do so.โ). \nNor can the April 23 Letter be fairly characterized as an instruction to enforce SB 4-C.  To \nthe contrary, the Attorney General made clear in the letter itself that he does not believe he has the \npower to issue such an instruction to the letterโs recipients.  And the letter incorporates a brief, \nwhich  at  length  explains  the Attorney  Generalโs  view  that  he  does  not  control  local  law \nenforcement officials.  See DE 56 at 6โ15; cf. Warren v. DeSantis, 90 F.4th 1115, 1130 (11th Cir. \n2024) (explaining that typically โelected officials do not exercise a significant degree of control \nover other elected officialsโ), vacated as moot, 125 F.4th 1361 (11th Cir. 2025); Chrysafis, 534 F. \nSupp. 3d at 298 (โ[T]he fact that the Attorney General provided general information to the local \nlaw enforcement officers who are directly responsible for complying with the [law] underscores \nthat it is other state and local officials, rather than the Attorney General, who have the particular \nduty to administer or enforce the [law].โ). \n3.  The Court explained that it was โsurprised and shockedโ by the April 23 Letter.  DE 71 \nat 23:19โ23.  Respectfully, a subjective reaction is irrelevant to the contempt analysis.  The \nstandard for civil contempt is โan objective one.โ  Taggart, 587 U.S. at 561.  All that matters is \nwhether the โconduct complied with the order at issue.โ  Doe v. Bush, 261 F.3d 1037, 1047 (11th \nCir. 2001) (quoting Howard Johnson Co. v. Khimani, 892 F.2d 1512, 1516 (11th Cir. 1990)); \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 14 of 20\nHornbeck Offshore Servs., LLC v. Salazar, 713 F.3d 787, 795 (5th Cir. 2013) (reversing finding of \ncontempt where defendantโs โactions did not violate the injunction as drafted,โ regardless of any \nsubjective โpurpose of the district courtโs injunctionโ); Scruggs, No. 2:07-cr-325, DE 34 at 24 \n(declining to impose contempt because defendant did not violate the โexpress terms of the \ninjunction,โ even when there was a โcloud of suspicion surroundingโ defendantโs conduct).  Here, \nthe Attorney General complied with the Courtโs order to cease enforcing SB 4-C.  That the Attorney \nGeneral also expressed his views of the merits of that orderโviews he has openly expressed in \nfilings before this Court and the Eleventh Circuitโdoes not violate any objective term of the \nCourtโs TRO.    \n4.  As noted above, in its April 29 Omnibus Order, this Court has apparently concluded \nthat the Attorney General of Florida has โcontrolโ and โstructural authorityโ over every state, \ncounty, and municipal law enforcement agency and officer in Florida.  Whatever the merits of that \nunprecedented holding,4 it was rendered after the April 23 Letter and thus cannot be considered as \n \n4 Nothing in either order comprising the TRO concluded that the Attorney General controls \nthe thousands of independently elected or appointed law enforcement officers across Florida.  \nIndeed, at the time of the April 23 Letter, no Florida or federal court had ever come to such a \nconclusion.  Rather, at the county level, the sheriff is the โchief โฆ law enforcement officer of the \ncounty.โ  Blackburn v. Brorein, 70 So. 2d 293, 296 (Fla. 1954).  The sheriff, thus, has the power to \nmake arrests. See Fla. Stat. ยง 30.15.  And he does so without oversight from the Attorney General.  \nSee Hufford v. Rodgers, 912 F.2d 1338, 1341โ42 (11th Cir. 1990) (examining Florida law and \ndiscerning  โno  intent  for  state  officials  to  control  or  supervise  the  sheriffโ);  Abusaid  v. \nHillsborough Cnty. Bd. of Cnty. Comโrs, 405 F.3d 1298, 1307 (11th Cir. 2005) (recognizing that \nsheriffs have โgreat independence in their day-to-day operationsโ over which โthe state has \nretained no controlโ).  Authority over local law enforcement is โcentralized in the county,โ so that \nโthe peopleโ are โable to place responsibility upon a particular officerโโthe sheriffโโfor failure \nof law enforcement.โ  Szell v. Lamar, 414 So. 2d 276, 277 (Fla. 5th DCA 1982).   \nFederal courts had repeatedly recognized the same thing: the Attorney General (at least \nwhen the statewide prosecutor lacks jurisdiction) โdoes not enforce Florida criminal statutes and \nis not a proper defendant in a challenge to the constitutionality of a criminal statute.โ  Report and \nRecommendation at *3, Caban v. Attorney General of the State of Fla., No. 23-cv-61316, 2023 \nWL 12081126 (S.D. Fla. Dec. 14, 2023) (collecting cases).  Recognizing as much, the Eleventh \nCircuit had held that the Attorney General did not โenforceโ a related immigration statute because \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 15 of 20\nground for contempt of the TRO, which included no such reasoning.  See Ga. Power Co., 484 F.3d \nat 1291 (โIn determining whether a party is in contempt of a court order, the order ... may not be \nexpanded beyond the meaning of its terms absent notice and an opportunity to be heard.โ (quoting \nRiccard v. Prudential Ins. Co., 307 F.3d 1277, 1296 (11th Cir. 2002))). \n5.  Any doubt on these issues must be resolved against a finding of contempt. \nFirst, the law is clear that โ[i]f there is a fair ground of doubt as to the wrongfulness of the \ndefendantโs actions said to be in contempt, the District Court should not entertain the civil contempt \nproceeding or find contempt.โ  Preemption Devices, Inc. v. Minn. Mining & Mfg. Co., 803 F.2d \n1170, 1173 (Fed. Cir. 1986); see also Taggert, 587 U.S. at 557; Roth, 935 F.3d at 1278; Stuart v. \nReynolds, 204 F. 709, 726 (5th Cir. 1913).  Here, at a minimum, there is a fair reading of the April \n23 Letter that is not contumacious because it does not enforce SB 4-C.  That alone is a reason not \nto find contempt.  See Ga. Power Co., 484 F.3d at 1291 (a court may โmake a finding of civil \ncontemptโthat is, willful disregard of the authority of this Courtโonly upon a showing that the \nalleged contempt is clear and convincingโ). \nSecond, the cited portion of the April 23 Letter, DE 67 at 40 n.25, is based on the Florida \nAttorney Generalโs understanding of his own role under Florida law.  The Attorney Generalโs \nposition, as expressed in the letter, was that the local law enforcement were bound by the Courtโs \nTRO, not by him.  DE 57-1.  Of course, federal courts have the power to interpret state law.  See \ngenerally Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64 (1938).  But the Court should still exercise restraint \n \nstate law did not give the Attorney General authority to โcontrolโ law enforcement officials.  City \nof S. Miami v. Governor, 65 F.4th 631, 641โ42 (11th Cir. 2023).   \nThe Attorney General, in short, would have had no way to know, when he wrote the April \n23 Letter, that his statement that he (as opposed to the Court) could not control local law \nenforcement was anything but a mine-run recitation of Florida law, as long understood by Florida \nofficials, Florida courts, and federal courts. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 16 of 20\nwhen opining on โdifficult questions of state law bearing on policy problems of substantial public \nimport.โ  Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 814 (1976).  That \nshould be doubly true in matters of contempt: it is one thing for this federal Court to disagree with \nthe Florida Attorney General about his role under the Florida Constitution; it is quite another to \nimpose contempt based on that disagreement.  \nThird, in analyzing contempt, the Court should not โignore the fact that a contempt sanction \nimposed on the Attorney General in his official capacity has greater public importance, with \nseparation of power overtones, and warrants more sensitive judicial scrutiny than such a sanction \nimposed on an ordinary litigant.โ  In re Attorney Gen. of U. S., 596 F.2d 58, 64 (2d Cir. 1979).  An \nattorney general, after all, is โa public official who exercises powers entrusted to him by both the \nexecutive and legislative branches, with obligations to the judicial branch โฆ Courts accordingly \nowe him respect as an official and, absent an abuse of power or misuse of office, the most careful \nand reasoned treatment as party or as litigant.โ  Id.  \nFourth, federalism principles counsel against finding the Attorney General in contempt.  \nThough federal courts no doubt possess broad equitable power, โappropriate consideration must \nbe given to principles of federalism in determining the availability and scope of equitable relief.โ  \nRizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362 (1976).  Federal courts are therefore โalways reluctantโ to exercise \nthat power to find a โ[state] official in contempt,โ Newman v. Alabama, 683 F.2d 1312, 1318 (11th \nCir. 1982)โespecially when doing so might interfere with the operation of state government.  \nIndeed, โconsiderations of comity and federalism argue for the federal courtsโ avoiding whenever \npossible getting involved in delicate issues concerning the internal structure of state government.โ  \nUnited Beverage Co. of S. Bend, Inc. v. Ind. Alcoholic Beverage Commโn, 760 F.2d 155, 160 (7th \nCir. 1985).  โAs representative of the dominant partner in the necessary interplay between the two \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 17 of 20\nsovereigns, federal courts  must  be especially  sensitive  to this  balance  and  assiduous  in  its \npreservation.โ  Duke v. Texas, 477 F.2d 244, 252 (5th Cir. 1973); see also Harris v. Samuels, 440 \nF.2d 748, 752 (5th Cir. 1971).   \nFifth, and relatedly, reading the Attorney Generalโs comments as contumacious risks \ndenying an important Florida government official the right to speak for himself.  See Wood v. \nGeorgia, 370 U.S. 375, 389 (1962) (โMen are entitled to speak as they please on matters vital to \nthem; errors in judgment or unsubstantiated opinions may be exposed, of course, but not through \npunishment for contempt for the expression.โ).  As a general matter, the government โis entitled to \nsay what it wishes.โ  Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995).  \nโIndeed, it is not easy to imagine how government could function if it lacked this freedomโ to \nโspeak for itself.โ  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 467โ68 (2009) (quotation marks \nomitted).  A federal court reading its TRO so broadly to limit the State Attorney Generalโs ability \nto communicate with State law enforcement about his view of the law would undermine Floridaโs \ngovernment structure, implicating serious First and Tenth Amendment concerns.   \n*  *  * \n  To โfind that sanctions are appropriate here,โ this Court โwould have to hold that โthere is \nno objectively reasonable basis for concluding that [the Florida Attorney Generalโs] conduct might \nbe lawful.โโ  Roth, 935 F.3d at 1278 (quoting Taggart, 587 U.S. at 557).  The Attorney General has \nconsistently abided by the Courtโs order to cease enforcing Florida Statutes Sections 811.102 and \n811.103.  Nowhere does the TRO (expressly or impliedly) require the Attorney General to refrain \nfrom sharing his views about the order with law enforcement.  At a minimum, there is โmore than \na โfair ground of doubtโ as to whetherโ the TRO โbarred [General Uthmeierโs] conduct.โ  Id. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 18 of 20\nII.  The April 23 Letter Did Not Violate the Temporary Restraining Order Because the \nAttorney General Provided Actual Notice of the Order to Law Enforcement.  \nThe TROโs second requirement was for the Attorney General to โprovide actual notice of \nthe TROโ to local law enforcement.  DE 49 at 2.  The Attorney General did exactly that.  See DE \n57-2 at 1 (providing notice that โall Florida law enforcement agencies at present must refrain from \nenforcing Sections 811.102 and 811.103โ).  And in doing so, he was clear that law enforcement \nshould โinstruct your officers and agents to comply with Judge Williamsโ directives.โ  Id. at 2.  \nNothing more was required to comply with the TRO. \nFor three reasons, nothing in the April 23 Letter undid that compliance.  First, by April 23 \nthe Attorney General had complied with the TRO.  He was required to provide actual notice.  And \nhe did it.  See Chairs v. Burgess, 143 F.3d 1432, 1436 (11th Cir. 1998) (โA person who attempts \nwith reasonable diligence to comply with a court order should not be held in contempt.โ (alteration \nomitted) (quoting Newman v. Graddick, 740 F.2d 1513, 1525 (11th Cir. 1984)); Mercer v. Mitchell, \n908 F.2d 763, 787 n.11 (11th Cir. 1990) (same).   \nSecond, nothing in the April 23 Letter revoked the Attorney Generalโs prior notice.  To the \ncontrary, the April 23 Letter reiterates the April 18 Letter.  It says: โall law enforcement agencies \nin Florida were bound by an ex parte temporary restraining order.โ  DE 57-1.  A fair reading of the \nApril 23 Letter thus cannot be read to undo the notice issued on April 18.   \nThird, the Attorney Generalโs criticism of the TRO did not undermine his notice.  To be \nsure, the Attorney General firmly disagrees with the TRO.  And the April 23 Letter shares the \nAttorney Generalโs view that the TRO was not proper.  But the Court required only notice; not \nnotice shorn from critique.5 \n \n5 When sanctions are premised on the failure to comply with a court order, the sanctions \ntestโwhether the court order was violatedโmirrors the contempt test.  E.g., In re Managed Care, \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 81   Entered on FLSD Docket 05/12/2025   Page 19 of 20\nCONCLUSION \n  For all these reasons, the Court should decline to hold the Attorney General of the State of \nFlorida in contempt or issue any other sanction.  \n \n                \nDated: May 12, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  s/ Jesse Panuccio   \n  Jesse Panuccio  \n  (Florida Bar No. 31401) \nEvan Ezray  \n(Florida Bar No. 1008228) \nJason Hilborn  \n(Florida Bar No. 1008829) \nBOIES SCHILLER FLEXNER LLP \n401 East Las Olas Blvd., Suite 1200 \nFort Lauderdale, Florida 33301 \njpannucio@bsfllp.com \n \nCounsel for the Attorney General of the State \nof Florida for the Contempt Proceedings \n \n \n \n756 F.3d 1222, 1240 (11th Cir. 2014).

Both Motions are fully briefed.1 \nOn April 18, 2025 and April 29, 2025, the Parties presented oral argument on the Motions \nbefore the Court (the โHearingsโ). (DE 48; DE 66.) For the reasons set forth below, the \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Injunction  (DE  4)  is  GRANTED  and  the  Motion  for  Class \nCertification (DE 5) is GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART.. \nI.  BACKGROUND  \nOn February 13, 2025, Florida Senate Bill 4-C (โS.B. 4-Cโ or the โStatuteโ) went \ninto effect. (DE 1 ยถ 40.) S.B. 4-C creates two new state law offenses: โIllegal entry by \nadult unauthorized alien2 into this stateโ and โIllegal reentry of an adult unauthorized \n \n1 Defendants filed responses in opposition to both Motions (DE 40; DE 44), and Plaintiffs \nreplied (DE 45; DE 46). \n2 The various statutes and cases discussed within this Order use a variety of terms, in \nadditional to โalien,โ to describe a noncitizen or foreign national in the United States. See \nUnited States Citizenship and Immigration Services, Glossary (last visited Apr. 27, 2025) \n(defining an โAlienโ as โ[a]ny person not a citizen or national of the United Statesโ as \ndefined  under  federal  law),  https://www.uscis.gov/tools/glossary.  For  clarity  and \nPage 1 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 2 of 49\nalien.โ Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102โ.103. Section 811.102(1) prohibits any โunauthorized alien \nwho is 18 years of age or olderโ3 from โknowingly enter[ing] or attempt[ing] to enterโ \nFlorida โafter entering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection \nby immigration officersโ (โillegal entryโ). A first conviction for illegal entry is a first-degree \nmisdemeanor, requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of nine monthsโ imprisonment, \nwhile  subsequent  convictions  are  felonies  with  escalating  mandatory  minimum \nsentences.  Fla.  Stat.  ยง  811.102(1)โ(3).  Under  subsection  811.103(1),  an  adult \nโunauthorized alienโ commits a third-degree felony, if they โenter[], attempt[] to enter, or \n[are]  at  any  time  found  inโ  Florida  after  โhaving  been  denied  admission,  excluded, \ndeported, or removed or having departed the United States during the time an order of \nexclusion,  deportation,  or  removal  is  outstandingโ  (โillegal  reentryโ).  Fla.  Stat.  ยง \n811.103(1). Importantly, the scheme requires courts to presume that โno conditions of \nrelease can reasonably assure the presenceโ of any individual arrested under either \nprovision and to order their detention without bond pending disposition of the case. Fla. \nStat. ยงยง 811.102(5), 811.103(4).   \nOn April 2, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint (DE 1) (โComplaintโ), \nseeking injunctive relief barring enforcement of S.B. 4-C by state and local officials and a \ndeclaration  that  the  law  violates  the  United  States  Constitutionโs  Supremacy  and \nCommerce Clauses. (DE 1 at 17.) Plaintiffs include individuals V.V. and Y.M. (collectively \n \nconsistency, when not quoting a source, the Court will use the phrase โnoncitizenโ \nthroughout this Order. \n3 An โunauthorized alienโ is defined as anyone unlawfully present in the United States \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act and any other applicable federal law. Fla. Stat. \nยง 811.101(2) (referencing Fla. Stat. ยง 908.111). \nPage 2 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 3 of 49\nโIndividual Plaintiffsโ), who allege they are at risk of arrest and prosecution under the \nStatute,  and  two  grassroots  membership  organizations,  Farmworker  Association  of \nFlorida,  Inc.  (โFWAFโ)  and  Florida  Immigrant  Coalition  (โFLICโ)  (collectively \nโOrganizational Plaintiffsโ), which support members who are similarly at risk. (Id. ยถยถ 8, \n11โ24, 26โ28.) On the same day, Plaintiffs sought class certification and a Temporary \nRestraining  Order  (โTROโ)  pausing  enforcement  of  S.B.  4-C  pending  the  Courtโs \nconsideration of their request for a preliminary injunction. (DE 4; DE 5.) On April 4, 2025, \nthe Court entered a TRO โprohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, employees, \nattorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with them from \nenforcingโ S.B. 4-C for fourteen days. (DE 28 at 14.) Then, on April 18, 2025, the Court \nheld a Hearing on whether to convert the TRO into a preliminary injunction. (DE 48.) At \nthe conclusion of the Hearing, the Court set an additional Hearing for April 29, 2025 and \nextended the TRO until that time. The Court reconvened on April 29, 2025, to address \nthe scope of injunctive relief. (DE 66.) Neither Party introduced evidence, so the Court \nrelies on the Partiesโ written briefs, supplemented by their oral arguments at the Hearings.  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to grant a \npreliminary injunction before final judgment in limited circumstances. The purpose of this \ninjunctive relief is to โpreserve the status quo until the district court renders a meaningful \ndecision on the merits.โ Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, 403 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th \nCir. 2005) (citation omitted). To merit a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary \ninjunction is necessary to prevent irreparable injury; (3) that the threatened \ninjury outweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other \nPage 3 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 4 of 49\nlitigant; and (4) that the preliminary injunction would not be averse to the \npublic interest. \n \nGissendaner v. Commโr, Ga. Depโt of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir. 2015) (quoting \nWellons v. Commโr, Ga. Depโt of Corr., 754 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir. 2014)). Plaintiffs \nโbear[] the burden of persuasion to clearly establish all four of these prerequisites.โ Wreal, \nLLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016) (internal quotations \nomitted).  \nA district court โmay provisionally certify a class for purposes of a preliminary \ninjunction.โ Al Otro Lado, Inc. v. McAleenan, 423 F. Supp. 3d 848, 870 (S.D. Cal. 2019) \n(citing Meyer v. Portfolio Recovery Assoc., LLC, 707 F.3d 1036, 1043 (9th Cir. 2012)); \nsee also Kaiser v. Cnty. of Sacramento, 780 F. Supp. 1309, 1312 (E.D. Cal. 1991) (โThe \ncourt has provisionally certified the class . . . pending modification or decertification should \nit become clear that the class is not maintainable. . . . Accordingly, the court may continue \nto grant injunctive relief on a class-wide basis.โ). However, Plaintiffs have the burden of \nโmeeting the threshold requirementsโ for class certification. Id.  \nRule 23(a) provides that a class may be certified only if: (1) the class is so \nnumerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or \nfact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are \ntypical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly \nand adequately protect the interests of the class. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). โThese four \nprerequisites  of  Rule  23(a)  are  commonly  referred  to  as  โnumerosity,  commonality, \ntypicality, and adequacy of representation.โโ Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharms., Inc., \n350 F.3d 1181, 1188 (11th Cir. 2003). Further, the class action must fall into one of \ncategories  enumerated  in  Rule  23(b).  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  23(b).  Plaintiffs  seek  class \nPage 4 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 5 of 49\ncertification under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when โthe party opposing the class has \nacted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive \nrelief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole[.]โ \nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2).  \nAs the Parties seeking class certification, Plaintiffs have โthe burden of proof,โ to \nshow that the requirements of Rule 23 are โโin factโ satisfied.โ Brown v. Electrolux Home \nProds., Inc., 817 F. 3d 1225, 1233 (11th Cir. 2016) (quoting Comcast Corp. v. Behrend, \n569 U.S. 27, 33 (2013)). Still, when determining whether the requirements for class \ncertification are met, the Court โshould not consider the merits of [Plaintiffsโ] claim[s]โ \nexcept to the extent โnecessary to determine whether the requirements of Rule 23 will be \nsatisfied.โ Williams v. Mohawk Indus., Inc., 568 F.3d 1350, 1358 (11th Cir. 2009) (citations \nomitted).  \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nThe Court begins by addressing whether Plaintiffs have standing to seek their \nrequested relief. See Wiand v. ATC Brokers Ltd., 96 F.4th 1303, 1311 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(noting that โstanding is a threshold jurisdictional questionโ and without establishing \nstanding a โdistrict court [is] not empowered to reach any merits questionโ). Then, the \nCourt will discuss the merits of the Motions. Finally, the Court will address the scope of \ninjunctive relief. \nA. Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. \nPlaintiffs who invoke โthe jurisdiction of a federal court bear[] the burden to show \nโ(1) an injury in fact, meaning an injury that is concrete and particularized, and actual or \nimminent, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the causal conduct, and (3) a \nPage 5 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 6 of 49\nlikelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.โโ CAMP Legal Def. \nFund, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 451 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Granite State \nOutdoor Advert., Inc. v. City of Clearwater, 351 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir. 2003)).  \nPlaintiffs must โsupport each element of standing with the manner and degree of \nevidence required at the successive stages of the litigation. At the preliminary injunction \nstage, then, the plaintiff must make a clear showing that she is likely to establish each \nelement of standing.โ Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 58 (2024) (citations and quotations \nomitted).4 โThe Supreme Court has been clear that standing in no way depends on the \nmerits  of  the  plaintiffโs  claim  .  .  .  [s]o  [courts]  generally  assess  plaintiffsโ  standing \nassum[ing] that on the merits the plaintiffs would be successful in their claims.โ Polelle v. \nFla. Secโy of State, 131 F.4th 1201, 1211 (11th Cir. 2025) (citations and quotations \nomitted). \nDefendants argue that all Plaintiffs lack standing. However, โ[w]here only injunctive \nrelief is sought, only one plaintiff with standing is required.โ Martin v. Kemp, 341 F. Supp. \n3d 1326, 1333 (N.D. Ga. 2018); see also Greater Birmingham Ministries v. Secโy of State \nfor State of Ala., 992 F.3d 1299, 1317 (11th Cir. 2021); Glassroth v. Moore, 335 F.3d \n1282, 1293 (11th Cir. 2003). Nonetheless, the Court analyzes standing for each individual \nand organizational Plaintiff and finds that all have standing.  \n1.  Individual Plaintiffs \n \n4 The Court notes that, in Murthy, the Supreme Courtโs analysis reflected the fact that the \nparties had taken discovery. Murthy, 603 U.S. at 58 (โWhere, as here, the parties have \ntaken discovery, the plaintiff cannot rest on โmere allegations,โ but must instead point to \nfactual evidence.โ). Here, no discovery has been conducted. See also Rocky Mountain \nGun Owners v. Polis, 121 F.4th 96, 108 (10th Cir. 2024) (โThe type of evidence that must \nbe presented to make this showing depends on the necessity and status of discovery in \nthe case.โ). \nPage 6 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 7 of 49\nโInjury in fact reflects the statutory requirement that a person be adversely affected \nor aggrieved, and it serves to distinguish a person with a direct stake in the outcome of a \nlitigationโeven though smallโfrom a person with a mere interest in the problem.โ Arcia \nv. Fla. Secโy of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. \nStudents Challenging Regul. Agency Procs., 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973)). An injury-\nin-fact  is  โan  invasion  of  a  legally  protected  interest  which  is  (a)  concrete  and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical[.]โ Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (citations omitted). Defendants argue that Individual \nPlaintiffs have failed to offer concrete plans to exit or enter Florida and therefore fail to \nestablish  an  injury.  Defendants  also  argue  that  Individual  Plaintiffs  have  no  legally \nprotected interest in the conduct they seek to vindicate. The Court addresses each point \nin turn.  \na.  Concrete Injury \nV.V. is a FWAF member who was previously deported and last reentered the \nUnited States without inspection in 2014. (DE 1 ยถ 16.) She now lives in Immokalee, Florida \nwith her husband and her four U.S. citizen children. (Id.) Plaintiff Y.M. is a FLIC member \nliving in Florida, who entered the United States without inspection more than twenty years \nago. (Id. ยถยถ 26โ27.) Y.M. leaves Florida twice a year with her minor U.S. citizen son who \nhas a disability. (Id. ยถยถ 26, 28.) Individual Plaintiffs argue that they are at imminent risk of \narrest and detention as they are subject to prosecution and imprisonment under S.B. 4-\nC. (Id. ยถ 59.) It is irrelevant that they have not yet been arrested or prosecuted: โWhen an \nindividual  is  subject  to  [the  threatened  enforcement  of  a  law],  an  actual  arrest, \nprosecution, or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.โ \nPage 7 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 8 of 49\nSusan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). โWhen the harm alleged is \nprospective, as it [is] here, a plaintiff can satisfy the injury-in-fact requirement by showing \nimminent harm. While the threatened future injury cannot be merely hypothetical or \nconjectural, probabilistic harm is enough.โ Arcia, 772 F.3d at 1341 (citations omitted).  \nPlaintiff V.V., whose prospective prosecution would fall under S.B. 4-Cโs illegal \nreentry provision, need not allege any travel plans. Under that provision, V.V. is subject \nto arrest, detention, and prosecution if she โis at any time found in this state.โ Fla. Stat. ยง \n811.103(1). Therefore, her affidavit attesting to her prior deportation, reentry without \ninspection, and current residence in Florida, is sufficient to demonstrate a concrete injury. \nPlaintiff Y.M. has attested that she leaves the state twice a year and intends to continue \ndoing so. Defendants characterize this testimony as the type of โโsome dayโ intentionsโ \ndisavowed by the Supreme Court in Lujan. However, in Lujan, the plaintiffsโwho alleged \ntheir injury was based on their hope to one day return to Sri Lanka to view endangered \nspeciesโtestified that they โhad no current plansโ to return, saying, โ[n]ot next year, I will \nsay. In the future.โ Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564. Those allegations are in stark contrast to Y.M.โs \ntestimony that she intends to travel in and out of state multiple times this year.5 See also \nFla.  State  Conf.  of  N.A.A.C.P.  v.  Browning,  522  F.3d  1153,  1161  (11th  Cir.  2008) \n(โImmediacy requires only that the anticipated injury occur with some fixed period of time \nin the future, not that it happen in the colloquial sense of soon or precisely within a certain \nnumber of days, weeks, or months.โ).  \n \n5 It is worth noting that nothing in standing jurisprudence โrequires a plaintiff who wishes \nto challenge the constitutionality of a law to confess that he will in fact violate that law.โ \nSusan B. Anthony List, 573 U.S. at 163. \n \nPage 8 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 9 of 49\nOther courts have found that a plaintiff has โsuffered an injury in fact [when] sheโs \nestablished โa realistic danger of sustaining direct injuryโ from โthe statuteโs operation or \nenforcement.โโ Farmworker Assโn of Fla., Inc., 734 F. Supp. 3d at 1321 (quoting Ga. \nLatino All. for Hum. Rts. v. Governor of Ga., 691 F.3d 1250, 1257 (11th Cir. 2012) \n(โGLAHRโ)). Law enforcement agencies in Florida have already made numerous arrests \npursuant to S.B. 4-Cโboth before and after the Courtโs entry of the TRO in this matterโ\nwhich the Court finds evinces a realistic probability that Individual Plaintiffs could be \nsubject to arrest and prosecution under S.B. 4-C.  \nb.  Legally Protected Interest \nDefendantsโ argument that Plaintiffs have no legally protected interest is based on \na misinterpretation of the right Plaintiffs seek to vindicate. Rather than seeking to drive \nwithout licenses, work without legal authorization, or seek to obtain transportation in \nviolation of federal and state law, as Defendants contend, Plaintiffs simply wish not to be \narrested and prosecuted under a law that violates constitutional principles of federalism. \nNumerous other federal courts have recognized this right as a legally protected interest. \nSee GLAHR, 691 F.3d 1257โ62; Farmworker Assโn of Fla., 734 F. Supp. 3d at 1321โ29; \nsee also Polelle, 131 F.4th at 1212 (โ[P]laintiffs allege a legally protected interest when \nthey meet the โlow barโ of pointing to some arguable or colorable federal or constitutional \ninterest.โ).  \n2.  Organizational Plaintiffs \nโAn organization can establish Article III standing either โthrough its members [or] \n. . . through its own injury in fact.โโ City of S. Mia. v. Governor, 65 F.4th 631, 637 (11th \nCir. 2023) (quoting Ga. Assโn of Latino Elected Offs., v. Gwinnett Cnty. Bd. of Registration \nPage 9 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 10 of 49\n& Elections, 36 F.4th 1100, 1114 (11th Cir. 2022)). As an initial matter, it is necessary to \nclarify Plaintiffsโ theory of standing: FWAF does not assert organizational standing based \non diversion of resources and neither FWAF nor FLIC seek to assert the rights of third \nparties. Accordingly, to the extent Defendantsโ briefing covers such arguments, they will \nnot be addressed.  \nโTo establish associational standing, an organization must prove that its members \nโwould otherwise have standing to sue in their own right.โโ Jacobson v. Fla. Secโy of State, \n974 F.3d 1236, 1249 (11th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). When analyzing associational \nstanding, โplaintiff-organizations [are required] to make specific allegations establishing \nthat at least one identified member had suffered or would suffer harm.โ Summers v. Earth \nIsland Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 498 (2009). V.V. is a member of both FWAF and FLIC, and \nY.M. is a member of FLIC. (DE 4-3 ยถยถ 15, 19.) As discussed, supra, Individual Plaintiffs \nhave standing to sue in their own right. Furthermore, both organizations allege that they \nhave membersโbeyond Individual Plaintiffsโwho would suffer harm if S.B. 4-C is not \nenjoined. Accordingly, the Court finds that the organizational plaintiffs have standing \nunder the theory of associational standing.6  \n3.  Traceability & Redressability \nโThe latter two requirements [of standing]โtraceability and redressabilityโoften \ntravel together, and where, as here, a plaintiff has sued to enjoin a government official \nfrom enforcing a law, he must show, at the very least, that the official has the authority to \nenforce the particular provision that he has challenged, such that an injunction prohibiting \n \n6 Because the Court finds the Organizational Plaintiffs each have associational standing, \nit does not need to reach Plaintiffsโ arguments that FLIC also has standing under a \ndiversion of resources theory.  \nPage 10 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 11 of 49\nenforcement would be effectual.โ Support Working Animals, Inc. v. Governor of Fla., 8 \nF.4th 1198, 1201 (11th Cir. 2021). Put another way, โ[w]hen traceability and redressability \nare at stake, the key questions are who caused the injury and how it can be remedied.โ \nCity of S. Mia., 65 F.4th at 640.   \nTo determine redressability, the Court focuses โon whether the injury that a plaintiff \nalleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation.โ Sprint Commcโns Co., L.P. v. APCC \nServs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 287 (2008) (emphasis in original). Defendants argue that \nPlaintiffs lack standing to sue all state attorneys but raise no arguments related to \nstanding as to the Attorney General or Statewide Prosecutor. The Court, in its prior order, \nfound Plaintiffs had standing to sue all Defendants. In this order, the Court only addresses \ntraceability and redressability as to the state attorneys.  \nThe injuries facing Plaintiffs are arrest and prosecution under S.B. 4-C. State \nattorneys are state officials charged with โprosecut[ing] or defend[ing] on behalf of the \nstate all suits, applications, or motions, civil or criminal, in which the state is a party[.]โ7 \nFla.  Stat.  ยง  27.02  (emphasis  added).  State  attorneys  are  tasked  with  prosecuting \nviolations of S.B. 4-C and Defendants do not dispute this delegation of responsibility. \nInstead, they argue that V.V. only has standing against the state attorney who could \nprosecute her in the city she resides in, and that Y.M. would only have standing against \nthe state attorney assigned to the jurisdiction where she will reenter the state. These \ngeographic strictures fail for several reasons. First, V.V. would be subject to prosecution \nanywhere and โany timeโ she is โfound [within the] state.โ Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(1). Second, \nbecause V.V. is a farmworker, she travels around the state and out of state for such work. \n \n7 There are certain exceptions to this duty, none of which are relevant here.  \nPage 11 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 12 of 49\n(DE 4-4 ยถ 8.) Y.M. does the same for personal travel. (DE 4-5 ยถ 7.) Neither must detail \ntheir precise paths of travel through each state attorneyโs jurisdiction to support standing. \nSee Drewniak v. U.S. Customs and Border Prot., 554 F. Supp. 3d 348, 363โ64 (D.N.H. \n2021) (Plaintiffsโ allegation that he would continue using a main intrastate highway to \ntravel between two areas in New Hampshire created a sufficient risk of being stopped at \na random CBP checkpoint for Article III standing, despite Plaintiff not alleging a precise \nroute or timing of travel); see also Babbitt v. United Farm Workers Nat. Union, 442 U.S. \n289, 298 (1979) (โWhen the plaintiff has alleged an intention to engage in a course of \nconduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and \nthere exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder, he should not be required to await \nand undergo a criminal prosecution as the sole means of seeking relief.โ) (internal \nquotations omitted). Defendantsโ arguments assume a rigidity of travel that does not \ncomport with the pleadings, case authority, or the realities of modern movement.   \nBecause the state attorneysโ authority to prosecute violations of S.B. 4-C would \ncause Plaintiffsโ injuries, enjoining them from doing so will directly redress those injuries. \nPut another way, Plaintiffsโ requested reliefโan order declaring the entry and reentry \nprovisions of S.B. 4-C to be unlawful and enjoining the state attorneys from prosecuting \npeople under those provisionsโwill directly resolve Plaintiffsโ reasonable fear that the \nchallenged law will be enforced against them or their members by those Defendants. \nGiven that Plaintiffs have standing, the Court will address the remainder of the factors \ngoverning their request for a preliminary injunction.8  \n \n8 Defendants advance a final threshold argument, namely that Plaintiffs lack a โcause of \nactionโ for their suit because the Supremacy Clause does not provide one and the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA) displaces equitable relief through its own detailed \nPage 12 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 13 of 49\nB. Plaintiffs have met the criteria for issuance of a preliminary injunction. \nAs stated above, to succeed on a motion for preliminary injunction Plaintiffs must \nshow: โ(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the preliminary \ninjunction  is  necessary  to  prevent  irreparable  injury;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury \noutweighs the harm the preliminary injunction would cause the other litigant; and (4) that \nthe preliminary injunction would not be averse to the public interest.โ Gissendaner, 779 \nF.3d at 1280 (citation omitted). The Court addresses each requirement in turn.  \n1.  Likelihood of success on the merits \nPlaintiffs argue S.B. 4-C violates the Supremacy Clause by creating a statutory \nscheme in an area exclusively reserved for the federal government that conflicts with \n \nremedial scheme. (DE 40 at 8โ11) (relying on Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 326โ29 (2015)). First, Plaintiffs have never advanced the theory that their \nsuit is pursuant to a โcause of actionโ granted by the Supremacy Clauseโinstead, they \nare invoking the Courtโs equitable jurisdiction pursuant to Ex parte Young. See Armstong, \n575 U.S. at 325, 326 (reiterating the well-accepted principles that the Supremacy Clause \nโcertainly does not create a cause of actionโ but that, โas [the Supreme Court] has long \nrecognized, if an individual claims federal law immunizes him from state regulation, the \ncourt may issue an injunction upon finding the state regulatory actions preemptedโ) (citing \nEx parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 155โ156 (1908)).  \nSecond, just days ago, Judge Ruiz squarely rejected Defendantsโ argument that the INA \ndisplaces equitable relief in a thorough, well-reasoned analysis in a case involving a \npreemption challenge to enforcement of another state immigration scheme. Farmworker \nAssโn of Fla., Inc. v. Uthmeier, No. 23-CV-22655 (S.D. Fla. Apr. 17, 2025), DE 137 at 5โ\n14. The Court will not rehash all the issues with Defendantsโ position in the same depth \nhere. In short, however, the fact that the INA delegates general โadministration and \nenforcementโ to the Secretary of Homeland Security, see 8 U.S.C. ยง 1103(a)(1), and \nprosecution of federal entry and reentry offenses to United States attorneys, see 8 U.S.C. \nยง 1329, in no way demonstrates a Congressional intent to displace equitable relief when \na party does not seek to enforce the INA, but seeks to avoid prosecution under a state \nlaw preempted by the INA. See Farmworker Assโn of Fla., Inc., No. 23-CV-22655, DE 137 \nat 10โ11 (concluding the INA does not contain a โsole remedy,โ foreclosing equitable \nrelief). Therefore, Plaintiffsโ ability to invoke equitable jurisdiction under Ex Parte Young \nremains intact. \nPage 13 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 14 of 49\nexisting federal immigration law and its enforcement. (DE 4 at 5); see U.S. Const. art. VI \n(making federal law the โsupreme Law of the Landโ). In other words, they argue that S.B. \n4-C is โfield preemptedโ and โconflict preemptedโ by federal immigration law governing \nentry, reentry, and continued presence of noncitizens. (Id. at 6, 11.) Plaintiffs further \ncontend that S.B. 4-C runs afoul of the Commerce Clauseโs implicit limitation on statesโ \npower to restrict the interstate movement of people. (Id. at 14); see U.S. Const. art. I, ยง \n8, cl. 3 (giving Congress the power to โregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and \namong the several States, and with the Indian Tribesโ). For the reasons set forth below, \nthe Court agrees that, at this early stage, Plaintiffs have shown they are likely to succeed \non the merits.   \na.  Supremacy Clause  \nWhen analyzing whether a state law is preempted by a federal scheme, โthe \npurpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone.โ Marrache v. Bacardi U.S.A., Inc., 17 \nF.4th 1084, 1094 (11th Cir. 2021) (quoting Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555, 565 (2009)). \nCongressional intent to preempt state law is most readily discernable when it is โexplicitly \nstated in the [federal] statuteโs language.โ Cipollone v. Liggett Grp., Inc., 505 U.S. 504, \n516  (1992)  (describing  express  preemption);  see  also  Marrache,  17  F.4th  at  1094 \n(describing an โexpress statement on preemptionโ as preferrable).9 However, state law \ncan also be โimpliedly preemptedโ by federal law in cases of conflict preemption and field \npreemption. Marrache, 17 F.4th at 1094.  \nConflict preemption occurs โwhere it is impossible for a private party to comply with \nboth state and federal laws . . . [or] the challenged state law stands as an obstacle to the \n \n9 Plaintiffs do not argue any such explicit statutory language is present here.  \nPage 14 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 15 of 49\naccomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.โ Crosby \nv.  Natโl  Foreign  Trade  Council,  520  U.S.  363,  373โ74  (2000)  (internal  citation  and \nquotations omitted). A state law is field preempted when it regulates conduct โin a field \nthat Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated by its \nexclusive governance.โ Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 399 (2012) (holding the \nfield of noncitizen registration is field preempted). โThe categories of preemption are not \nrigidly distinct . . . [and] field pre-emption may be understood as a species of conflict pre-\nemption.โ Natโl Assโn of State Utility Consumer Advocs. v. Fed. Commcโn Commโn, 457 \nF.3d 1238, 1252 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Crosby, 530 U.S. at 372 n.6). Of course, the \nCourt will not assume Congress intended to supersede the historic police powers of the \nStates โin the absence of persuasive reasonsโeither that the nature of the regulated \nsubject matter permits no other conclusion, or that the Congress has unmistakably so \nordained.โ Marrache, 17 F.4th at 1095 (quoting Natโl Assโn of State Util. Consumer \nAdvocs., 457 F.3d at 1252). However, both the nature of the subject matter and the \nextensive scheme of regulation authored by Congress over decades support the Courtโs \nanalysis set out below.  \ni.  Field Preemption \nCourts may infer an intent to displace state law from a โframework of regulation so \npervasive that Congress left no room for the States to supplement it, or where there is a \nfederal  interest  so  dominant  that  the  federal  system  will  be  assumed  to  preclude \nenforcement of state laws on the same subject.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 399 (alterations \naccepted and internal quotations omitted).  \nPage 15 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 16 of 49\nโFor nearly 150 years, the Supreme Court [and other federal courts have] held that \nthe power to control immigrationโthe entry, admission, and removal of noncitizensโis \nexclusively a federal power.โ United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, 278โ79 (5th Cir. 2024). \nMost recently, courts established that federal law preempts any state scheme in the fields \nof noncitizen registration and the transport and movement of noncitizens, both closely \nrelated to illegal entry and reentry. In fact, in those cases, courts grouped federal entry \nand reentry provisions together with the other fields as part of โthe larger context of federal \nstatutes criminalizing the acts undertaken by aliens and those who assist them in coming \nto, or remaining within, the United States.โ GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1264; Arizona, 567 U.S. \nat 395โ96 (describing the INAs โextensive and complexโ scheme as not just covering \nnoncitizen  registration,  but  also  โwho  may  not  be  admitted  to  the  United  States,โ \nโ[u]nlawful entry and unlawful reentry into the country,โ and โwhich aliens may be removed \nfrom the United Statesโ) (citing 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1325, 1326, the federal entry and reentry \nprovisions S.B. 4-C is modeled after). \nFirst, in Arizona, the Supreme Court held that the field of noncitizen registration \nwas fully occupied by the comprehensive immigration scheme created in 1952 by the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (โINAโ), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101, et seq. 567 U.S. at 401โ02; see \nalso Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, 331 (2022) (โCongress has comprehensively detailed \nthe rules by which noncitizens may enter and live in the United States. When noncitizens \nviolate those rules, Congress has provided procedures for their removal.โ). The Supreme \nCourt found that the noncitizen registration provisions within this scheme โprovide a full \nset of standards . . . including the punishment for noncompliance. It was designed as a \nโharmonious whole.โโ Id. at 401 (quoting Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 72 (1941)). \nPage 16 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 17 of 49\nFurther, the Court noted the importance to U.S. foreign relations of having โa single \nsovereign responsible for maintaining a comprehensive and unified systemโ to track \nnoncitizens. Id. at 401โ02. โIt is fundamental that foreign countries concerned about the \nstatus, safety, and security of their nationals in the United States must be able to confer \nand communicate on this subject with one national sovereign, not the 50 separate States.โ \nId. at 395; see also Hines, 312 U.S. at 64 (โOne of the most important and delicate of all \ninternational relationships, recognized immemorially as a responsibility of government, \nhas to do with the protection of the just rights of a country's own nationals when those \nnationals are in another country.โ). \nThe Eleventh, Ninth, and Fourth Circuits found these principles apply with equal \nforce to the federal governmentโs regulation of noncitizen transport and movement. See, \ne.g.,  GLAHR,  691  F.3d  at  1263โ64  (holding  the  โINA  provides  a  comprehensive \nframework to penalize the transportation, concealment, and inducement of unlawfully \npresent aliens,โ preempting a Georgia state law regulating the same conduct); United \nStates v. Alabama, 691 F.3d 1269, 1287 (11th Cir. 2012) (agreeing with GLAHR and \nholding Alabamaโs similar law was field preempted); Valle del Sol Inc. v. Whiting, 732 \nF.3d 1006, 1026 (9th Cir. 2013) (same for Arizona law); United States v. South Carolina, \n720 F.3d 518, 530โ32 (4th Cir. 2013) (same for South Carolina law). The INA creates \nprohibitions for offenses relating to noncitizen transport and movement, specifies criminal \nand  civil  penalties,  and  delegates  enforcement  of  the  provisions  to  United  States \nattorneys. GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1263โ64 (citing 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1324, 1329). โLike the federal \nregistration scheme addressed in Arizona, [this is] a โfull set of standardsโ to govern the \nunlawful transport and movement of aliens.โ Id. at 1264 (quoting Arizona, 567 U.S. at \nPage 17 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 18 of 49\n401). Further, restricting the movement of noncitizens into and within the United States \nby criminalizing those who transport, conceal, or encourage their movement impacts โthe \nstatus, safety, and security of [foreign] nationals in the United Statesโ such that foreign \ncountries โmust be able to confer and communicate on this subject with one national \nsovereign, not the 50 separate states.โ Whiting, 723 F.3d at 1023โ24.        \nFederal regulation of entry and reentry share both traitsโcomprehensiveness and \nimpact on sensitive foreign relations interestsโwith that of noncitizen registration and \nnoncitizen transportation and movement. The INA defines and prohibits illegal entry and \nreentry and creates specific civil and criminal penalties for violations. 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1325 \n(entry),  1326  (reentry).  The  reentry  provision  in  particular  recognizes  the  need  for \nnuanced immigration decisions. For instance, it provides differing penalties for those \nreentering without prior convictions and those reentering after โcommission of three or \nmore  misdemeanorsโ  involving  specified  offenses  or  โan  aggravated  felony,โ  those \nreentering after being excluded from the United States after committing terrorist activities, \nand those reentering after being removed prior to completion of a prison sentence. 8 \nU.S.C. ยง 1326(b)(1)โ(4), (c). And like the provisions regarding noncitizen transportation \naddressed in GLAHR, the INA โconfin[es] the prosecution of [illegal entry and reentry] to \nfederal courtโ and โlimit[s] the power to pursue those cases to the appropriate United \nStates Attorney.โ GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1265; see 8 U.S.C. ยง 1329. Together, these \nprovisions provide โa full set of standards governing [entry and reentry], including the \npunishment for noncomplianceโ and methods of enforcement. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 401. \nThey were โdesigned as a harmonious whole . . . reflecting a Congressional decision to \nforeclose any state regulation in the area.โ Id.     \nPage 18 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 19 of 49\n Second, the criminalization of unauthorized noncitizen entry and reentry into the \nUnited States impacts โthe status, safety, and securityโ of foreign nationals in an even \nmore direct way than the regulation of noncitizen transport. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 395. \nโ[T]he protection of the just rights of a countryโs own nationals when those nationals are \nin  another  countryโ  is  โone  of  the  most  important  and  delicate  of  all  international \nrelationships.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 395 (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 64). Therefore, the \nfederal government has a strong foreign relations interest in being the sole entity setting \npolicy for the treatment of foreign nationals coming across the U.S. border and moving \nthroughout the country. Texas, 97 F.4th at 283โ84 (โField preemption of the entry . . . of \nnoncitizens is indicated by the breadth of the United Statesโ power โto control and conduct \nrelations with foreign nations,โ and the reasons for the existence of that power.โ) (quoting \nArizona, 567 U.S. at 395).  \nDefendants resist the great weight of this authority by positing hollow distinctions \nbetween the INA provisions involving the noncitizen registration and transportation and \nmovement  fields,  and  the  illegal  entry  and  reentry  field.  (DE  40  at  14โ16.)  First, \nDefendants argue โthe INAโs entry and reentry crimes are far less detailed than those for \nalien registration.โ (Id. at 14.) But apart from citing the few statutory provisions that govern \neach, Defendants provide no support for this claim. (Id.)  \nNext, Defendants argue that the unique federal interests at stake in the noncitizen \nregistration  field  analyzed  in  Arizonaโmaintaining  reciprocal  expectations  for  the \ntreatment of foreign nationals in other countriesโis not implicated by restrictions on \nnoncitizen movement into and throughout the U.S. (Id. at 15.) According to Defendants, \nnoncitizen registration impacts โperfectly law-abidingโ noncitizens, while entry crimes \nPage 19 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 20 of 49\nโinherently affect only non-law-abiding [noncitizens],โ so have a โmore muted impact on \nโamity and commerceโ between nations.โ (Id.) (quoting Hines, 312 U.S. at 64โ66).  \nNotably, the Arizona Court did not make this strained differentiation. Rather, it \nspoke broadly about the interest that foreign governments have in the โstatus, safety, and \nsecurity of their nationalsโ abroad, and the corollary need for federal governance of \nimmigration and noncitizen status to prevent States from โtak[ing] action that would \nundermine foreign relations[.]โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 395. This makes sense, given that \nthe noncitizen registration provision at issue in Arizona expressly exempted persons \nlawfully present in the United States. Ariz. Stat. ยง 13-1509(F). And even if it did not, those \nwho would be subject to Arizonaโs noncitizen registration provision would also be in \nviolation of the federal noncitizen registration provision, see 8 U.S.C. ยง 1304(e), just as \nthose who would be in violation of S.B. 4-C are also in violation of the federal entry or \nreentry  law.  Therefore,  there  is  no  difference  between  the  โlaw-abidingโ  status  of \nindividuals subject to the two laws, nor between the strength of the federal governmentsโ \ninterests in managing treatment of foreign nationals across the two contexts.10  \n \n10 Defendants also attempt to undermine the precedential value of GLAHR and Alabama, \nsaying  โtransport  and  harboring  are  special  because,  as  [the  GLAHR  court]  noted, \nCongress had specifically limited state participation in those crimes to arrest under federal \nlaw.โ (DE 40 at 15) (citing GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1266 (citing 8 U.S.C. ยง 1324(c)). Yet, the \nfact that the INA allows state officials to make arrests for transport and harboring crimes \nbut not for entry and reentry crimes undercuts Defendantsโ position. Congress knew how \nto carve out a role for states to play in immigration enforcement and chose to exclude \nstate law enforcement entirely from enforcement of federal entry and reentry provisions. \nSee United States v. Pate, 84 F.4th 1196, 1202 (11th Cir. 2023) (โ[W]here Congress \nincludes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of \nthe same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in \nthe disparate inclusion or exclusion.โ) (internal quotations omitted). This is additional \nevidence of congressional intent to foreclose state participation in the field.      \nPage 20 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 21 of 49\nAccordingly, courts across the country have unanimously held that nearly identical \nstate illegal entry and reentry laws recently enacted are likely preempted by federal \nimmigration law governing noncitizen entry. See e.g., United States v. Iowa, 126 F.4th \n1334, 1346 (8th Cir. 2025) (affirming preliminary injunction against Iowaโs illegal entry \nand reentry law, after holding the law conflicts โwith federal law because it creates a \nparallel scheme of enforcement for immigration lawโ), vacated as moot, No. 24-2265, \n2025 WL 1140834 (8th Cir. Apr. 15, 2025); Texas, 97 F.4th at 287โ88 (holding Texas had \nnot shown its illegal entry scheme was not both field and conflict preempted by federal \nlaw); United States v. Oklahoma, 739 F. Supp. 3d 985, 999 (W.D. Okla. 2024) (โ[T]here \nis strong support for the conclusion that Congress has legislated so comprehensively in \nthe field of noncitizen entry and reentry that it left no room for supplementary state \nlegislation.โ) (internal quotations omitted), appeal filed, No. 24-6144 (10th Cir. 2024); \nMemorandum Decision and Order, Idaho Org. of Res.

Defendantsโ disagreement with existing precedent is \na hallmark of their argument.

Conflict Preemption  \nโ[S]tate laws are [also] preempted when they conflict with federal law.โ Arizona, \n567  U.S.  at  399.

For example, even when Arizona imposed a state law penalty for conduct \nalready proscribed by the federal governmentโwillful failure to complete or carry an โalien \nregistrationโ cardโthe Supreme Court concluded that โ[permitting] the State to impose \n \n13 See Fla.

But in \nthis way, S.B. 4-C is no different than the state analogues in Arizona, GLAHR, and other \nsimilar cases. Glossing onto a federal crime the requirement that the prohibited conduct \ntake place within a given state does not remove the problematic convergence between \nthe schemes.      \nPage 22 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 23 of 49\nits own penalties for the federal offenses here would conflict with the careful framework \nCongress adopted.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 402. The state could prosecute violations even \nwhen federal officials determined they would โfrustrate federal policies.โ Id.; see also \nGLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1265 (โBy confining the prosecution of federal immigration crimes to \nfederal court, Congress limited the power to pursue those cases to the appropriate United \nStates Attorney.โ). Further, inconsistencies between penalties under the state and federal \nschemes create an actual conflict. Arizona, 567 U.S. at 402โ03 (state laws precluding a \nsentence  of  probation  conflicted  with  federal  laws  allowing  probation  for  the  same \nconduct).  \nS.B. 4-C appears to suffer from the same debilities as the noncitizen registration \nlaw struck down in Arizona. First, it gives state officials authority to prosecute illegal entry \nor reentry in cases where federal actors may choose not to. Even if federal and state \nofficials choose to commence parallel dual prosecutions under both laws, S.B. 4-Cโs \nmandatory detention provision limits federal law enforcement discretion to recommend \npre-trial release and obstructs federal courtsโ ability to conduct proceedings requiring \ndefendantsโ presence. Relatedly, state officials are free to prosecute a charge under S.B. \n4-C even while a federal immigration proceeding is underway, which may determine that \nthe defendant may remain lawfully present under federal law. See Texas, 97 F.4th at 279 \n(noting as problematic the possibility that under Texasโ illegal entry laws, a defendant \ncould be removed through the state proceeding โbefore federal proceedings that would \npermit her to remain in the United States lawfully have been initiated or concludedโ). \nFinally, S.B. 4-C requires mandatory prison sentences for state law violations where the \nINA allows for a fine or probation for the equivalent federal crime. Compare Fla. Stat. ยง \nPage 23 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 24 of 49\n811.102(1) (mandating a minimum of a nine-month prison sentence for a first illegal entry \nconviction), with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325(a) (authorizing a maximum prison sentence of six \nmonths but not mandating any incarceration upon a first improper entry). \nRather  than  address  any  of  these  conflicts,  Defendants  invoke  the  general \nprinciple that โnothing about the โoverlapโ in federal and state criminal law demands \npreemption.โ (DE 40 at 17) (citing Kansas v. Garcia, 589 U.S. 191, 212 (2020)).15 It is of \ncourse true that any overlap between federal and state laws does not create a per se \nconflict. But S.B. 4-C does not just share some overlapping features with federal entry \nand reentry lawsโit creates an entirely separate enforcement scheme for essentially the \nsame conduct regulated by the federal government. The Fifth Circuit in Texas considered \nand rejected these exact overlap arguments,16 concluding, when โtwo separate remedies \nare brought to bear on the same activity,โ โconflict is imminent.โ Texas, 97 F.4th at 289; \nsee also Brief for Appellants at 25โ27, Texas, 97 F.4th 268 (No. 24-50149), 2024 WL \n1220010 (citing Garcia to make the same conflict preemption arguments Defendants \n \n15 Garcia involved a claim that Kansasโ general fraud statute is preempted by provisions \nof the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (โIRCAโ), which (1) require \nemployees to provide certain personal information to employers on an I-9 form used verify \nthe employeesโ work authorization, and (2) prohibit the use of the information contained \nin the form for most purposes aside from work authorization verification.

Respondents were convicted under the Kansas \nstatute after providing the same false information on certain tax-withholding forms, which \nthey provided on their I-9 forms. Id. at 198โ99. The Court concluded that โthe mere fact \nthat state laws like the Kansas provisions at issue overlap to some degree with federal \ncriminal provisions does not even begin to make a case for conflict preemption.โ Id. at \n212. The incidental overlap between the general fraud statute at issue in Garcia and the \nIRCA is simply not comparable to the complete overlap between the conduct prohibited \nby S.B. 4-C and federal entry and reentry provisions.             \n16 Once again, Defendants do not engage in any meaningful discussion of that case. See \nsupra n.8. Rather, they cite the dissent as a guide for this Courtโs determination.

Because S.B. 4-C imposes a different pretrial detention and penalty scheme \nand shifts enforcement discretion to state officers for essentially the same conduct \nproscribed by federal law, S.B. 4-C is likely conflict preempted.   \nb.  Commerce Clause  \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  S.B.  4-C  violates  the  Commerce  Clause,  which  gives \nCongress power to โregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl 3; see (DE 4 at 14). That \npower  โencompasses  the  movement  in  interstate  commerce  of  persons  as  well  as \ncommodities.โ United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 758โ59 (1966); see also Edwards \nv.  California,  314  U.S.  160,  172  (1941)  (โ[I]t  is  settled  beyond  question  that  the \ntransportation of persons is โcommerce,โ within the meaning ofโ the Commerce Clause.). \nImplicit in congressional power to regulate interstate commerce is an โimplicit or โdormantโ \nlimitation on the authority of the States to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.โ \nFla. Transp. Servs., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty., 703 F.3d 1230, 1243 (11th Cir. 2012). \nWhen a scheme โdirectly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerceโ it will \ngenerally be โstruck down . . . without further inquiry.โ Bainbridge v. Turner, 311 F.3d \n1104, 1109 (11th Cir. 2002).17  \nPlaintiffs assert that S.B. 4-C facially discriminates against interstate commerce by \ncriminalizing entry across Floridaโs border only by certain noncitizens. (DE 4 at 14โ15.) \nAlthough the Court has determined that a preliminary injunction is appropriate based on \n \n17 A law may be excepted from this nearly per se rule if it is shown to โadvance a local \npurpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.โ \nId. (quoting New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988)). But given \nthat S.B. 4-C basically duplicates existing federal law, it is unlikely Florida can make a \nshowing that its state law version is necessary in this context.  \nPage 25 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 26 of 49\nPlaintiffsโ preemption argument, it should be noted that courts have determined similar \nstatutes violate the dormant commerce clause on this basis. See, e.g., Edwards, 314 U.S. \nat 174, 177 (striking down Californiaโs ban on transportation of indigent nonresidents into \nthe state because it had the โplain and sole functionโ of restricting interstate commerce); \nUnited States v. Texas, 719 F. Supp. 3d 640, 679 (W.D. Tex. 2024) (holding โ[o]n its face, \n[Texasโ illegal entry law] discriminates against foreign commerce,โ so violates the dormant \ncommerce clause).18 Therefore, at this juncture, the Court finds that Plaintiffsโ Commerce \nClause analysis also supports their request for a preliminary injunction.  \n2.  Irreparable injury \nPlaintiffs argue that, absent an immediate pause to enforcement of S.B. 4-C, they \nwill suffer irreparable harm by being placed at risk of arrest, prosecution, and detention \nunder an unconstitutional state statute. (DE 4 at 17.19) In their Supplemental Response, \nPlaintiffs note several reports documenting recent arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C. (DE 23 \n \n18 At the April 18, 2025 Hearing, Defendants cited the district court opinion in United \nStates v. Arizona as counter-authority. United States v. Arizona, 703 F. Supp. 2d 980 (D. \nAriz.  2010), affโd, 641  F.3d  339  (9th  Cir.  2011), affโd  in  part,  revโd  in  part  and \nremanded, 567 U.S. 387 (2012), and affโd in part, revโd in part, 689 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir. \n2012). (DE 50 at 50.) There, the district court judge preliminarily enjoined several Arizona \nimmigration provisions after finding they were preempted by federal law. The appeal of \nthe courtโs order eventually led to the Supreme Court decision Arizona, 567 U.S. 387. \nWhile the court granted the injunction on preemption grounds, it rejected the United \nStatesโ argument that Arizonaโs noncitizen transport prohibition likely violated the dormant \ncommerce  clause.  Id.  at  1002โ04.  However,  the  court  based  that  decision  on  its \ndetermination that the Arizona law โdoes not restrict or limit which aliens can enter \nArizona.โ Id. at 1003. S.B. 4-C contains explicit language as to which noncitizens may \nenter Florida. Additionally, neither the Ninth Circuit nor Supreme Court discussed the \ncommerce clause issue in their decisions. Consequently, the district courtโs analysis in \nArizona is both inapplicable and unpersuasive here.         \n19 The Court uses CM/ECF page numbering, which appears in the top right corner of all \nfilings. \nPage 26 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 27 of 49\nat 2.)

And, as noted during the Hearing on April 18, 2025, more \nthan a dozen persons in Leon County, including a United States citizen, have been \narrested even after the Court entered the TRO enjoining enforcement of S.B. 4-C. (DE 50 \nat 12.) As discussed, supra, Individual Plaintiffsโ declarations confirm they are at risk of \narrest  and  prosecution  given  ongoing  enforcement  of  the  S.B.  4-C.  Likewise, \nOrganizational  Plaintiffsโ  declarations  support  the  conclusion  that  a  subset  of  their \nmembers may be susceptible to the lawโs enforcement. (DE 4-2 at 3โ4; DE 4-3 at 3โ4) \n(attesting to the many FWAF and FLIC members without documentation who entered or \nreentered without inspection and regularly travel between Florida and other states). \nBecause โPlaintiffs are under the threat of state prosecution for crimes that conflict with \nfederal law,โ a preliminary injunction is necessary to mitigate the risk of irreparable harm \nfrom S.B. 4-C. GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1269.  \n3.

Provisional class certification is appropriate. \nPlaintiffs ask the Court to issue provisional class certification โfor the purpose of \nissuing a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction,โ and then โconsider any \noutstanding questions before proceeding to full class certification.โ (DE 5 at 2.) Plaintiffs \npropose the following two classes, which draw from the language of S.B. 4-Cโs two \noffense provisions to capture anyone โpotentially subjectโ to their enforcement: \n[A]ny person not a citizen or national of the United States who may now or \nin the future enter or attempt to enter the state of Florida after entering the \nUnited  States  by  eluding  or  avoiding  examination  or  inspection  by \nimmigration officers [(โProposed Entry Classโ)]. \n \n[A]ny person not a citizen or national of the United States who may enter, \nattempt to enter, or be found in the state of Florida after the person has \nbeen denied admission to or excluded, deported, or removed from the \nUnited States; or has departed from the United States while an order of \nexclusion, deportation, or removal was outstanding [(โProposed Reentry \nClassโ)]. \n \n(Id. at 2.)

Commonality and Typicality \nCommonality is met when there are โquestions of law or fact common to the \nclass[es.]โ Fed R. Civ P. (23)(a)(2). โCommonality requires the [P]laintiff[s] to demonstrate \nthat the class members have suffered the same injury. This does not mean merely that \nthey have all suffered a violation of the same provision of law . . . . Their claims must \ndepend on a common contentionโfor example, [in a Title VII context,] the discriminatory \nbias on the part of the same supervisor.โ Duke, 564 U.S. at 350.  \nMeanwhile, typicality ensures โthe claims or defenses of the representative parties \nare typical of the claims or defenses of the class[es.]โ Fed. R. Civ P. (23)(a)(3). The inquiry \nโturns on โwhether other members have the same or similar injury, whether the action is \nbased on conduct which is not unique to the named class plaintiffs, and whether other \nclass members have been injured by the same course of conduct.โโ Gayle v. Meade, 614 \nF. Supp. 3d 1175, 1231 (S.D. Fla. 2020) (quoting In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., \n286 F.R.D. 645, 653 (S.D. Fla. 2012)). This nexus exists when โclaims or defenses of the \nclass and the class representative arise from the same event or pattern or practice and \nare based on the same legal theory.โ Id. (quoting In re Terazosin Hydrochloride Antitrust \nLitig., 220 F.R.D. 672, 686 (S.D. Fla. 2004)).  \n[T]he commonality and typicality requirements . . . tend to merge. Both \nserve  as  guideposts  for  determining  whether  under  the  particular \ncircumstances maintenance of a class action is economical and whether \nthe named plaintiffโs claim and the class claims are so interrelated that the \ninterests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in \ntheir absence. \n \nDukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5 (internal quotations omitted). \nPage 30 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 31 of 49\nHere, members of the proposed classes plainly advance the same contention. All \nmembers of the Proposed Entry Class will make the same facial constitutional challenges \nto S.B. 4-Cโs entry provision, and the members of the Proposed Reentry Class will engage \nin the same challenge for the Statuteโs reentry provision. Therefore, the โclass-wide \nproceeding [will] generate common answers apt to drive the resolution of the litigation.โ \nId. at 350. It follows that typicality is also met, as the class representatives challenge the \nsame provisions of S.B. 4-C on the same legal grounds and seek the same relief as the \nunnamed class members.   \nDefendants argue commonality is defeated because the Court โwould need to \nanswer a myriad of questionsโ related to individualsโ travel habits, ages, and immigration \nstatutes to determine whether a given person is within one of the classes. (DE 44 at 8.) \nBut this misapprehends the inquiry. โ[F]or purposes of [commonality], even a single \ncommon question will do[.]โ Dukes, 564 U.S. at 359 (internal quotations omitted and \nalterations accepted). In this case, the common questions are core to resolving Plaintiffsโ \nclaims and providing effective relief: whether the entry and reentry provisions violate the \nSupremacy Clause or Commerce Clause.  \nDefendants repackage this same argument to challenge the proposed classesโ \ntypicality. (DE 44 at 9) (arguing Plaintiffs do not meet typicality โwhen so many class \nmembers โmayโ โpotentiallyโ qualify for one or more of the numerous affirmative defenses \nthe statute makes available to themโ). This again misunderstands the purpose of the \nrequirement. Typicality ensures that the interests of representatives are โso interrelated \nthat the interests of the class members will be fairly and adequately protected in their \nabsence.โ Dukes, 564 U.S. at 349 n.5. Despite the potential for some class members to \nPage 31 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 32 of 49\ninvoke an affirmative defense during a prosecution under S.B. 4-C inapplicable to others, \nthey are all subject to arrest and detention under the law. Thus, the type and source of \ntheir injuries are shared. So are their claims and requested relief. See Gayle, 614 F. Supp. \n3d at 1231 (individuals confined across three detention centers under similar conditions \nexposing them to illness meet typicality, despite individual differences in the detention \nfacility and personal risk factors). Therefore, commonality and typicality are met.  \n3.  Adequacy of representation \nThe class must also be structured such that named Plaintiffs โfairly and adequately \nprotect the interests of the classโ. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(4). Adequacy of representation \ndepends on โ(1) whether plaintiffsโ counsel are qualified, experienced, and generally able \nto conduct the proposed litigation and . . . (2) whether plaintiffs have interests antagonistic \nto those of the rest of the class.โ Cheney, 213 F.R.D. at 495 (internal quotations omitted). \nDefendants do not contest that these requirements are met.  \nPlaintiffsโ  counsel  includes  a  large  team  of  attorneys  who  have  significant \nexperience litigating class actions, immigration cases, and cases seeking injunctive relief, \nincluding from laws similar to S.B. 4-C. (DE 5-1.) Counsel has confirmed no conflicts of \ninterest exist and that they pledge to devote the resources required to effectively litigate \nthis case. (DE 5 at 13.) Therefore, Plaintiffsโ counsel are able to conduct the proposed \nlitigation.  \nLikewise, the named Plaintiffsโ interests are aligned with the class membersโ for \nthe same reasons outlined in the Courtโs typicality discussion. The class members are \nthose subject to enforcement of S.B. 4-C by virtue of being noncitizens who entered or \nreentered the United States without inspection with plans to enter or reenter Florida, or \nPage 32 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 33 of 49\nare present in Florida after reentering the United States. The named Plaintiffs each fall \ninto one of these categories. See (DE 4-4 at 1; DE 4-5 at 2โ3) (declarations of V.V. and \nY.M.). Therefore, Rule 23(a)(4)โs adequacy of representation requirement is also met.  \n4.  Rule 23(b)(2) \nDefendants also do not contest that this case fits within the Rule 23(b)(2) category. \nRule 23(b)(2) โhas been liberally applied in the area of civil rights.โ Braggs v. Dunn, 317 \nF.R.D. 634, 667 (N.D. Ala. 2016). Indeed, โsome courts have gone so far as to say that \nthe ruleโs requirements are โalmost automatically satisfied in actions primarily seeking \ninjunctive relief.โโ Id. (quoting Baby Neal v. Casey, 43 F.3d 48, 59 (3d Cir. 1994). โThe \ncritical inquiry is whether the class members have suffered a common injury that may \nproperly be addressed by class-wide injunctive or equitable relief.โ Ibrahim , 326 F.R.D. \nat 701 (S.D. Fla. 2018) (citing Holmes v. Continental Can Co., 706 F.2d 1144, 1155 (11th \nCir. 1983)); see also Dukes, 564 U.S. at 360 (โThe key to the (b)(2) class is โthe indivisible \nnature of the injunctive or declaratory remedy warrantedโthe notion that the conduct is \nsuch that it can be enjoined or declared unlawful only as to all of the class members or \nas to none of them.โโ).  \nThe  proposed  class  members  all  face  the  common  risk  of  being  subject  to \nenforcement of S.B. 4-C, a law Plaintiffs claim is unconstitutional. See Susan B. Anthony \nList, 573 U.S. at 161 (holding the threat of prosecution pursuant to an unconstitutional \nstatute was an injury-in-fact). That injury would be addressed for all members of each \nclass through a class-wide injunction preventing enforcement of the lawโs entry and \nreentry provisions. And Plaintiffsโ facial constitutional challenge to both provisions of S.B. \nPage 33 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 34 of 49\n4-C would result in class-wide injunctions if meritorious. Consequently, this case fits \nsquarely into the category described in Rule 23(b)(2).  \n5.  Defendantsโ other objections \nDefendantsโ other objections to Plaintiffsโ proposed classes revolve around the \nstated concern that the proposed classes are โamorphous and imprecise.โ (DE 44 at 6โ\n7) (arguing the classes are not โadequately defined and clearly ascertainableโ because \nthey include anyone โwho โmay enter, attempt to enter, or be found in the State,โ do not \ndefine โa โparticular time periodโ during which harms will occur,โ and do not distinguish \nbetween people who โmay have different immigration histories, which may qualify them \nfor affirmative defenses under S.B. 4-C and eliminate the possibility of injury in fact.โ \n(emphasis added) (quoting Fisher v. Ciba Specialty Chems. Corp., 238 F.R.D. 273, 301 \n(S.D. Ala. 2006); see also (id. at 7) (describing Plaintiffsโ classes as โoverbroadโ because \nthey include individuals who are merely โpotentially subject to [S.B.] 4-Cโ so do not โmatch \n[Plaintiffsโ] claim that Florida is harming the smaller group of individuals who are actually \nsubject toโ the law) (internal quotations omitted). \nDefendants misperceive what is required in a case like this for classes to be \ndeemed ascertainable. Defendants cite cases in which plaintiffs sought class certification \nto obtain class-wide damages for past harms. See, e.g., Cherry v. Dometic Corp., 986 \nF.3d 1296, 1300 (11th Cir. 2021) (requesting class certification under Rule 23(b)(3) to \nseek damages); Cordoba v. DIRECTV, LLC, 942 F.3d 1259, 1264 (11th Cir. 2019); \n(same);  Fisher,  238  F.R.D.  at  277,  296  (same).  But  classes  constructed  to  seek \nprospective class-wide injunctive relief are inherently different from those formed to seek \nbackward-looking  damages.  Shelton  v.  Bledsoe,  775  F.3d  554,  560  (3d  Cir.  2015) \nPage 34 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 35 of 49\n(โThough classes certified under Rule 23(b)(3) and Rule 23(b)(2) all proceed as โclass \nactions,โ the two subsections actually create two remarkably different litigation devices.โ). \nโBecause the focus in a [Rule 23](b)(2) class is more heavily placed on the nature of the \nremedy sought, and because a remedy obtained by one member will naturally affect the \nothers, the identities of individual class members are less critical in a [Rule 23](b)(2) action \nthan in a [Rule 23](b)(3) action.โ Id. at 561 (citing Dukes, 564 U.S. at 362โ63). In fact, \ncourts within the Eleventh Circuit have expressed โserious reason to doubt that the \njudicially created ascertainability requirement applies to Rule 23(b)(2) classes.โ Braggs, \n317 F.R.D. at 671.22 In this case, where Plaintiffs allege class members face risks of \nfuture harm, Defendantsโ claim that the class definitions must โspecify a particular group \nharmed during a particular time period via a particular manner,โ is untenable. Fisher, 238 \nF.R.D. at 301; see also Shook v. El Paso Cnty, 386 F.3d 963, 972 (10th Cir. 2004) \n(โ[W]hile  the  lack  of  identifiability  is  a  factor  that  may  defeat  Rule  23(b)(3)  class \ncertification, such is not the case with respect to class certification under Rule 23(b)(2). . \n.  .  In  fact,  many  courts  have  found  Rule  23(b)(2)  well  suited  for  cases  where  the \ncomposition of a class is not readily ascertainable; for instance, in a case where the \nplaintiffs attempt to bring a suit on behalf of a shifting prison population.โ) (citations \nomitted).  \n \n22 The Eleventh Circuit has described classes generally as needing to be โadequately \ndefined and clearly ascertainable,โ but has not had occasion to analyze in-depth how \nascertainability differs between class actions under 23(b)(3) and 23(b)(2). Cherry, 986 \nF.3d at 1302 (internal quotations omitted); AA Suncoast Chiropractic Clinic, P.A. v. \nProgressive American Insurance Company, 938 F.3d 1170, 1174 (11th Cir. 2019) (relying \non a 23(b)(3) case when articulating the rule that โ[e]very class must be โadequately \ndefined and clearly ascertainable.โโ) (quoting Little v.

Cordoba, 942 F.3d at 1273 (while it is not \nnecessary for unnamed class members to โprove their standing before a class could be \ncertified,โ  the  likelihood  that  putative  class  members  have  standing  โis  assuredly  a \nrelevant factor that a district court must consider when deciding whether and how to certify \na classโ). It is โwell-established that the [C]ourt may, in its discretion, modify the definition \nof the proposed class to provide the necessary precision or to correct other deficiencies.โ \nRivera v. Harvest Bakery Inc., 312 F.R.D. 254, 267 (E.D.N.Y. 2016) (alterations accepted \nand  internal  quotations  omitted).  Plaintiffsโ  proposed  class  definitions  contain  two \ndeficiencies that increase the likelihood of there being class members who cannot show \nimminent risk of enforcement under S.B. 4-C: (1) Plaintiffs neglect to require that class \nmembers are eighteen years or older, an element of S.B. 4-Cโs entry and reentry offenses, \nand (2) Plaintiffs include those who merely โmayโ enter, attempt to enter, or be found in \nthe state of Florida. Correcting for these two deficiencies will ensure that an individual will \nqualify as a class member as soon as they meet the elements of either S.B. 4-C offense, \nand so are at concrete and imminent risk of enforcement. Shook, 386 F.3d at 972 \n(recognizing  the  fluidity  of  class  membership  as  a  feature  in  Rule  23(b)(2)  cases); \nKenneth R. ex rel. Tri-County CAP, Inc./GS v. Hassan, 293 F.R.D. 254, 264 (D.N.H. 2013) \n(โ[W]here certification of a (b)(2) injunctive class is sought, actual membership of the class \nneed  not  be  precisely  delimited  because  notice  to  the  members  is  not  required.โ) \n(quotations omitted and alterations accepted). Therefore, the Court will provisionally \ncertify two classes, defined as follows:  \nPage 36 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 37 of 49\nAny person eighteen years of age or older, who is not a citizen or national \nof the United States who enters or attempts to enter the state of Florida after \nentering the United States by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection \nby immigration officers (โEntry Classโ). \n \nAny person eighteen years of age or older, who is not a citizen or national \nof the United States who enters, attempts to enter, or is in the state of \nFlorida  after  the  person  has  been  denied  admission  to  or  excluded, \ndeported, or removed from the United States; or has departed from the \nUnited States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal was \noutstanding (โReentry Classโ). \n \nD. Scope of the Injunction \nHaving established that a preliminary injunction is warranted, the Court addresses \nthe scope of the injunction. Following the Courtโs entry of a TRO, local law enforcement \nagencies continued to make arrests for purported violations of S.B. 4-C. See, e.g., (DE \n57-6). Defendants argue that law enforcement agencies, who are not named defendants \nin this action, are not bound by the Courtโs orders. For the reasons set forth below, the \nCourt finds that local law enforcement agencies23 are bound by the Courtโs Order and \ncannot make arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C unless the Court enters a future order dissolving \nthe injunction or a higher reviewing court modifies or overrules this Order. \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 provides that a Courtโs injunctive power binds \nthe parties; the partiesโ officers, agent, servants, employees, and attorneys; and other \npersons who are in active concert or participation with the parties or their officers, agents, \nservants, employees, and/or attorneys. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2).   \n \n23 To avoid any confusion, the Court clarifies that local law enforcement agencies, as \nused in this section, refers to statewide law enforcement agencies such as Florida \nHighway  Patrol  and  Florida  Department  of  Law  Enforcement,  along  with  any  other \nmunicipal  or  county  law  enforcement  agencies  throughout  the  state  of Florida  who \npresent cases to the named state attorneys and the Attorney General for prosecution. \nPage 37 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 38 of 49\nThis [rule] is derived from the common[-]law doctrine that a decree of \ninjunction not only binds the parties defendant but also those identified with \nthem in interest, in โprivityโ with them, represented by them or subject to their \ncontrol. In essence it is that defendants may not nullify a decree by carrying \nout prohibited acts through aiders and abettors, although they were not \nparties to the original proceeding. \n \nRegal  Knitwear  Co.  v.  N.L.R.B.,  324  U.S.  9,  14  (1945).  It  is  undisputed  that  law \nenforcement  agencies  are  not  named  parties  in  this  action.  Defendants  argue  that \nFloridaโs law enforcement officers are not: (1) Defendantsโ officers, agents, servants, \nemployees,  or  attorneys;  or  (2)  invariably  in  active  concert  or  participation  with \nDefendants. The Court addresses each argument in turn. \n1.  Agents and Servants \nโRule 65(d) โcannot be read to restrict the inherent power of a court to protect its \nability to render a binding judgment.โโ USA v. Robinson, 83 F.4th 868, 878โ79 (11th Cir. \n2023) (quoting U.S. v. Hall, 472 F.2d 261, 267 (5th Cir. 1972)). โAn injunction is not a \ngame of whack-a-mole where the Court must repeatedly issue new injunctions to address \nthe Defendantsโ post-injunction craftiness.โ Id. at 885. As both Parties agree, the agent \nor servant inquiry turns on whether the bound Party controls the other. See (DE 56 at 6) \n(โTo fall within the common-law definition of all the categories listed in Rule 65(d)(2), law-\nenforcement officers must be subject to Defendantsโ control and wield authority to act on \nDefendantsโ behalf.โ); (DE 57 at 13) (citing Regal Knitwear Co., 324 U.S. at 14 (injunction \nbinds โthose . . . subject to [Defendantsโ] controlโ).   \nDefendants argue that they are unable to exercise control over law enforcement \nofficials because โPlaintiffs have identified no legal authority empowering Defendants to \ndiscipline law-enforcement officers in a managerial capacityโ; โlaw-enforcement offices \ndo  not receive  their  funding  from  Defendantsโ  coffersโ;  and โmany  law-enforcement \nPage 38 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 39 of 49\nofficials  are  either  directly  elected  by  local  constituenciesโ  or  โappointed  by  local \ngovernments.โ (DE 56 at 7โ8.)  \nIn responding to these assertions, Plaintiffs submitted copies of letters sent by \nDefendant Attorney General Uthmeier (โAG Uthmeierโ) to the Mayor of Orlando and the \nCity Council of Fort Meyers pursuant to his authority under Florida Statute 908.107, \nthreatening removal of those officials from their offices based on his perception that they \nhad failed to use their best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.24 \n(DE 57-3; DE 57-4.) Furthermore, the Court is aware of multiple posts on AG Uthmeierโs \nsocial media, directing state law enforcement agencies, like Florida Highway Patrol \n(โFHPโ), Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (โFWCโ), and Florida Department of Law \nEnforcement (โFDLEโ) to act. For instance, on March 27, 2025, AG Uthmeier tweeted \nfrom his official account, โToday, at my direction, FDLE and FWC executed a search \nwarrant at the Gulf World Marine Park in Panama City Beach.โ @AGJamesUthmeier, \n \n24 In addition to the threat of removal, the statutory section allows AG Uthmeier to โfile \nsuit against a local governmental entity or local law enforcement agencyโ for any violation \nof state laws mandating cooperation with the federal government in the enforcement of \nfederal immigration law. Fla. Stat. ยง 908.107(2). A government officialโs threat to file suit \nis the โemploy[ment of] the coercive apparatus of the governmentโ and โan overt threat of \nspecific punishment.โ See Kando v. City of Long Beach, No. 21-56199, 2023 WL 3092304 \nat *1 (9th Cir. Apr. 26, 2023) (discussing the coercive impact of a government officialโs \nthreat to file suit in the context of a first-amendment retaliation claim). Certainly, AG \nUthmeierโs power to file suit is, practically speaking, a form of control over local law \nenforcement. The Defendants rely on the courtโs analysis in Jacobson to rebut the claim \nof control. (DE 56 at 8.) In Jacobson, the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the Secretary of \nStateโs (โSecretaryโ) power to bring suits to enforce the performance of any duties of a \ncounty supervisor of elections was insufficient to show the Secretary of Stateโs traceability \nfor standing purposes to a law implemented by those supervisors. 974 F.3d at 1253โ54. \nFirst, the court was engaged in a standing analysis, not an inquiry under Rule 65(d)(2). \nSecond, in Jacobson, the record showed that the power to file suit was โthe only means \nof control the Secretary has over the Supervisors.โ Id. at 1253. The Court notes AG \nUthmeierโs power to file suit as just one of several means of control of law enforcement \nagencies that he enjoys.   \nPage 39 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 40 of 49\nTwitter  (Mar.  27,  2025,  4:29  p.m.),  https://perma.cc/HAJ8-MMU2.  The  next  day,  he \nannounced,  โAt  my  direction,  the  [FHP]  and  [FDLE]  will  monitor  the  planned \nโTeslaTakedownโ events across Florida tomorrow. . . . If these protests, turn violent, we \nwill  do  whatโs  necessary  to  restore  order  and  hold  offenders  accountable.โ \n@AGJamesUthmeier, Twitter (Mar. 28, 2025, 5:49 p.m.), https://perma.cc/YSV7-LU44.25 \nThose statements by the party Defendant support a conclusion that he exerts a measure \nof control over state and local law enforcement agenciesโ criminal enforcement efforts, \nincluding those related to immigration.26  \nAG Uthmeierโs asserted control over state law enforcement agencies is grounded \nin his constitutional and statutory authority over those agencies. The Attorney General is \nthe โchief state legal officerโ and a member of the Governorโs three-member Cabinet. Fla. \nConst. art. IV. ยง 4. As a member of the Cabinet, AG Uthmeier is one of the heads of FDLE \n \n25 Pursuant to this Courtโs Order (DE 49), on April 18, 2025, AG Uthmeier sent a letter to \nthe law enforcement community notifying โthat all Florida law enforcement agencies at \npresent must refrain from enforcingโ S.B. 4-C. (DE 57-2 at 2.). He continued, โPlease \ninstruct your officers and agents to comply with [the Courtโs] directives.โ (Id. at 3.) Then, \non his own initiative, on April 23, 2025, AG Uthmeier sent a follow-up letter to the law \nenforcement community reversing his prior directive. (DE 57-1.) It said, โI cannot prevent \nyou from enforcing ยงยง 811.102 and 811.103, where there remains no judicial order that \nproperly restrains you from doing so.โ (Id. at 2.) Aside from the clear misstatement that \nthere is โno judicial orderโ that restrains law enforcement from arresting individuals \npursuant to S.B. 4-C, AG Uthmeierโs assessment that the order does not โproperlyโ \nrestrain them demonstrates his active effort to counsel law enforcement. As discussed at \nApril 29, 2025 Hearing, this letter will be the subject of a separate proceeding.   \n26 The Court takes judicial notice of these communications โto establish that the matters \nhad been publicly assertedโ by AG Uthmeier, not for the truth of the matters asserted \ntherein. Sec. & Exch. Commโn v. Fiore, 416 F. Supp. 3d 306, 329 (S.D.N.Y. 2019); see \nalso Roth v.

Fla. Stat. ยง 20.201 (creating FDLE and making the Governor and Cabinet \nโhead[s] of the departmentโ);27 Fla. Stat. ยง 20.24 (creating the Department of Highway \nSafety  and  Motor  Vehicles  (โDHSMVโ),  headed  by  the  Governor  and  Cabinet,  and \ncreating FHP as a division of DHSMV).28 Further, AG Uthmeier is empowered to โgive an \nofficial opinion and legal advice . . . on any question of law relating to the official dutiesโ \nof any state or local officer. Fla. Stat. ยง 16.01(3). โAlthough an opinion of the Attorney \nGeneral is not binding on a court, [Florida courts give it] careful consideration and \ngenerally [regard it] as highly persuasive.โ Am. Home Assur. Co. v. Natโl R.R. Passenger \nCorp., 908 So. 2d 459, 473 (Fla. 2005).29  \nBased  on  AG  Uthemeierโs  own  statements  directing  the  conduct  of  law \nenforcement actors, which appear to be premised on his structural authority over state \nand  local  law  enforcement  agencies,  the  Court  finds  that  both  are  bound  by  the \npreliminary injunction pursuant to a theory of agency with AG Uthmeier.  \n \n27 For example, AG Uthmeier is empowered to directly assign FHP patrol officers to his \noffice for security services. Fla. Stat ยง 321.04(4). \n28 Defendantsโ reliance on Support Working Animals is misplaced. In that case, the \nEleventh Circuit held only that โthe Attorney General is not the head of FDLEโ but is \ninstead โone of several heads of the FDLE.โ Support Working Animals, Inc., 8 F.4th at \n1204 (citing Fla. Stat. ยง 20.201) (emphasis in original). That there are other Florida \nCabinet members that may exercise control over the FDLE does not change the Courtโs \nanalysis. \n29 It should be noted that, though local law enforcement budgets may not be directly under \nAG Uthmeierโs control, his office controls a number of funds from which money may flow \nto or benefit law enforcement agencies throughout the state. See e.g., (DE 56 at 8 n.5) \n(describing AG Uthmeierโs authority to โgive grants to sheriffsโ from the Crim Stopper \nTrust Fund created by Florida Statute ยง 16.555); Fla. Stat. ยง 16.54 (establishing the \nFlorida Crime Prevention Training Institute Revolving Trust Fund which funds various \ncrime prevention programs for law enforcement personnel). This access to funding can \nbe construed as another form of control.   \nPage 41 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 42 of 49\n2.  Active Concert or Participation \nโ[A] district court may bind nonparties โwho are in active concertโ with a defendant, \nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2)(C), . . . when a plaintiff validly invokes federal jurisdiction by \nsatisfying  the  traceability  and  redressability  requirements  of  standing  against  a \ndefendant.โ Jacobson, 974 F.3d at 1255. As discussed, supra, Plaintiffs have validly \ninvoked the Courtโs jurisdiction and established standing. Therefore, the only question \nremaining before the Court is whether local law enforcement departments are in active \nconcert or participation with Defendants.   \nโSubsection Cโs active concert or participation criterion is directed to the actuality \nof concert or participation, without regard to the motives that prompt the concert or \nparticipation.โ Al Otro Lado v. Wolf, 497 F. Supp. 3d 914, 929 (S.D. Cal. 2020). Put \nanother way, \n[t]he phrase โin active concert or participationโ in no respect implies any \nconspiratorial, devious, or insidious intent or design by [the parties]. The \nphrase โin active concert or participationโ stands in Rule 65 in the ordinary \nand usual sense and means a purposeful acting of two or more persons \ntogether or toward the same end, a purposeful acting of one in accord with \nthe ends of the other, or the purposeful act or omission of one in a manner \nor by a means that furthers or advances the other. \n \nEst. of Kyle Thomas Brennan v.

Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 26 (1968). Therefore, when \nlaw enforcement agencies conduct arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C, they do so in order for \nnamed Defendants to file and prosecute charges under the Statute. In other words, law \nenforcement agencies conduct arrests to allow the named Defendants to enforce S.B. 4-\nC by initiating prosecution.

See e.g., Fla. Sta. ยง 27.255 (declaring any investigator employed \nby a state attorney to be a law enforcement officer, with full powers of arrest); Fla. Stat ยง \n985.145(5)โ(6) (requiring a state attorney to notify the arresting law enforcement agency \nwhen a juvenile is arrested and subsequently referred to mental health services or a \ndiversionary program); Fla.

(DE 56 \nat 8โ9.) The Court disagrees. In City of South Miami, the Eleventh Circuit made clear that \nitโs holding that plaintiffs did not have standing was based on a lack of evidence developed \nin that particular record and did not foreclose the possibility that a different record \nincluding  different  evidence  could  have  established  that  named  defendants  exerted \ncontrol over the law enforcement. 65 F.4th at 642 (โThe record contains no evidenceโ\nnoneโthat Governor DeSantis would use his suspension authority to encourage racial \nprofiling. . . . The organizationsโ failure to produce any evidence to trace any injury to the \ngovernor and attorney general does not foreclose the possibility that these officials could \nbe proper defendants on a different record, as our precedents make clear.โ) Here, even \nprior to any formal discovery, there is evidence that AG Uthmeier has used his authority \nto encourage local law enforcement to continue making arrests under a law the Court \nhas, for the time being, found unconstitutional. See (DE 57-1) (letter from AG Uthmeier \nto the law enforcement community freeing them to make arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C and \n \ncircuit);  Fla.  Stat.  ยง  985.12  (mandating  that  state  attorneys,  local  law  enforcement \nagencies, and others, collaborate to create juvenile delinquency citation programs in each \njudicial circuit in Florida); Sixth Jud. Circ. of Fla. L.R. 2021-043 (requiring a local law \nenforcement agency to forward to the state attorney any affidavit alleging a violation of a \nprotective order); Seventeenth Jud. Circ. of Fla. L.R. 2021-28-UFC (A1) (establishing a \njuvenile civil citation program whereby local law enforcement agencies in Broward County \nmust forward all qualifying juvenile referral arrest forms to the state attorney and the state \nattorney must notify the sending law enforcement agency if any additional information is \nneeded to make a prosecution decision).  \nIt  is  clear  from  these,  along  with  many  other  areas  of  partnership,  that  local  law \nenforcement agencies act in concert with state attorneys in the operation of the criminal \nsystem. The Court acknowledges that the State Attorney Defendants are to this point \nadhering to the Courtโs TRO in advising partnering law enforcement officers not to make \narrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C. \nPage 44 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 45 of 49\ndisavowing the TROโs effect on law enforcement officers). AG Uthmeierโs role in providing \nlegal advice to state and local law enforcement officials, see supra, creates a stark \ncontrast to the record in City of South Miami.  \nIn any event, the separation between local law enforcement and Defendants still \ndoes not foreclose local law enforcement from falling within the scope of the Courtโs \nOrder. โ[T]he โactive concert or participationโ clause supposes legal distinctiveness; if \n[local law enforcement and Defendants] were the same party, the order would be binding \ndirectly. The โactive concert or participationโ clause is designed to prevent what may well \nhave happened here: the addressee of an injunction, eager to avoid its obligations, \npersuades a friendly third party to take steps that frustrate the injunctionโs effectiveness.โ \nLindland v. U.S. Wrestling Assโn, Inc., 227 F.3d 1000, 1006 (7th Cir. 2000).  \nFinally,31 the Court finds that the logical outcome of Defendantsโ argument raises \ngrave constitutional concerns. โIt is basic to [the Supremacy Clause] that all conflicting \n \n31 The Court views the Partiesโ arguments regarding privity to be tangential to the issue \nat hand. Privity, at least in the narrow conception Defendants propose, is not necessary \nwhere there is no need to adduce a special relationship between persons because the \naction is against state officials in their official capacities. Will v. Michigan Depโt of State \nPolice, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989) (โObviously, state officials literally are persons. But a suit \nagainst a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but \nrather is a suit against the officialโs office. As such, it is no different from a suit against the \nState itself.โ) (citations omitted).  \nBut even if some notion of privity can inform a case like this, Defendantsโ reliance on \nWilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir. 1985), and Hargis v. City of Orlando, \n586 F. Appโx 493, 498 (11th Cir. 2014), is misplaced. In those cases, courts held officer-\ndefendants in section 1983 cases claiming false arrest were not collaterally estopped by \nadverse state criminal court rulings. Wilson, 757 F.2d at 1237โ38; Hargis, 586 F. Appโx \nat 497โ98. In that context, the โprosecutors represent the interests of the people of the \nState . . ., not the interests of the arresting police officer[s]. Hargis, 586 F. Appโx at 498 \n(alteration accepted). In this case, Plaintiffs are seeking prospective, forward relief from \nenforcement of an allegedly unconstitutional law, and law enforcement agencies and \nstate  prosecutors  have  the  same  interest  in  enforcing  that  law.  Neither  Plaintiffs, \nDefendants, nor the Court have found any authority applying the construct of privity to \nPage 45 of 49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 67   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/29/2025   Page 46 of 49\nstate provisions be without effect.โ Maryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 728 (1981); see \nalso Irving v. Mazda Motor Corp., 136 F.3d 764, 767 (11th Cir. 1998) (โ[S]tate law that \nconflicts with federal law is โwithout effect.โโ) (quoting Cipollone, 505 U.S. at 516). And \nthough it is clear Defendants disagree with the Courtโs analysis, since April 4, 2025, the \nCourt has found that there is a substantial likelihood that S.B. 4-C is unconstitutional. โAs \na fundamental proposition, orders of the court must be obeyed until reversed by orderly \nreview. . . . If the order appears to be incorrect, the proper course of action lies in review[.]โ \nKleiner v. First Nat. Bank of Atlanta, 751 F.2d 1193, 1208 (11th Cir. 1985) (citations \nomitted); see also Evans v. Williams, 206 F.3d 1292, 1299 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (โ[A] party \nfaced with an invalid injunction must have the injunction modified or vacated; he cannot \nsimply ignore it.โ); Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 314 (1967) (โ[I]f the \ninjunction was erroneous, jurisdiction was not thereby forfeited, that the error was subject \nto correction only by the ordinary method of appeal, and disobedience to the order \nconstituted contempt.โ).  \nโThe Fourth Amendment protects the right of the people to be secure in their \npersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures. \nBecause  arrests  are  seizures  of  persons,  they  must  be  reasonable  under  the \ncircumstances.โ D.C. v. Wesby, 583 U.S. 48, 56 (2018). โ[T]he โreasonablenessโ of an \narrest is, in turn, determined by the presence or absence of probable cause for the arrest.โ \nSkop v.

(quoting United States v. Floyd, 281 F.3d 1346, 1348 (11th \nCir. 2002)). Further, โ[i]t is axiomatic that seizures have purposes,โ and โwhen those \npurposes are spent, further seizure is unreasonable.โ Williams v. Dart, 967 F.3d 625, 634 \n(7th Cir. 2020). โAt the time of the founding and still today, the primary purpose of an \narrest is to ensure the arrestee appears to answer charges.โ Id.

To posit, as Defendants do, that law enforcement may arrest \nindividuals for conduct they know has no current legal basis to sustain criminal charges, \nis to upend Fourth Amendment jurisprudence in its entirety. Terry, 392 U.S. at 9 (โNo right \nis held more sacred, or is more carefully guarded . . . than the right of every individual to \nthe possession and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of \nothers, unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.โ).  \nIV.

Indeed, in their view, this Court is powerless to enjoin any arrests under \nthis illegal law, no matter how clear the Court makes its order, and instead each and every law \nenforcement agency must be formally joined to this litigationโand every other challenge to \nunconstitutional state laws.  \nYet more troublingly, Defendants appear to have encouraged future arrests despite the \nCourtโs clear directive. The Attorney General sent a letter to all law enforcement officers in the \nstate expressing โ[his] view that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes your agencies \nfrom continuing to enforceโ S.B. 4C. Ex. A. Of course, this Courtโs Order extending the TRO \ncould not have been clearer that all law enforcement officers are barred from conducting arrests \nunder S.B. 4C. And neither the Attorney General nor any other person may decline to comply \nwith a court order even if they believe (wrongly) that it is not โlawful [or] legitimate.โ Id. After \nall, โit is firmly settled that a court order โmust be obeyedโ until it is โreversed for errorโ by the \nissuing court or a โhigherโ one. J.G.G. v. Trump, No. 25-766, 2025 WL 1119481, at *8 (D.D.C. \nApr. 16, 2025) (quoting Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 314 (1967)).  \nEven setting aside this apparent effort to undermine the Courtโs order, Defendantsโ \nposition is baseless. Courts have long held that law enforcement officers who participate in \nenforcing an enjoined law are bound where, as here, they act in concert with the enjoined parties \nto carry out prohibited conduct and are provided with notice of the injunction. Additionally, \nprivity exists because, in a lawsuit challenging the validity of a state law, the interests of law \nenforcement and prosecutors are identical: enforcing state law and defending it against facial \nconstitutional challenge. Law enforcement officers have also aided and abetted violations of this \nCourtโs injunction by arresting individuals under the enjoined provisions. And, contrary to \nDefendantsโ position, Florida law gives the Attorney General control over law enforcement when \nit comes to immigration issues. Defendantsโ arguments to the contrary misunderstand the scope \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(2), misapply settled law, and, if accepted, would invite \nevasion of judicial authority. โ[A]n injunction is not a game of whack-a-mole where the Court \nmust repeatedly issue new injunctions to address the Defendantsโ post-injunction craftiness.โ \n  1 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 3 of 17\nUnited States v. Robinson, 83 F.4th 868, 885 (11th Cir. 2023) (citation omitted). This Court \nshould confirm the scope of its orders.  \nBACKGROUND \n  This suit challenges the legality of S.B. 4C, a criminal law that purports to authorize law \nenforcement officers to arrest, prosecutors to prosecute, and judges to convict noncitizens for \nstate law immigration crimes. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction and temporary \nrestraining order, emphasizing the threat of arrest both as a reason the law is preempted and as an \nimminent harm requiring rapid relief. See, e.g., Dkt. 4 at 1, 4, 8, 10-11 (โif unilateral arrests \nalone were enough for preemption in Arizona, then unilateral arrests, prosecutions, and detention \nunder S.B. 4C must be preempted as wellโ); id. at 16 (โSince enacting S.B. 4C, law enforcement \nagencies in Florida have already made several arrests pursuant to these laws. Plaintiffs are at risk \nof being next.โ) (footnote omitted); id. at 17 (noting harm to public trust if state officers make \narrests); Dkt. 23 at 2 (urging speed given โincreasing reports that state officials have already \nbegun arresting noncitizens under the statuteโ). \nOn April 4, 2025, this Court issued a TRO enjoining enforcement of S.B. 4Cโs illegal \nentry and reentry provisions, finding that Plaintiffs demonstrated a strong likelihood of success \non the merits and that enforcement of the law would cause irreparable harm. Dkt. 28. On the \nquestions of standing and irreparable injury, the Court emphasized the โrisk of arrestโ that \nPlaintiffs had established. Id. at 5-6; 12-13. Pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2), the Court barred \nany enforcement by Defendants; โtheir officers, agents, employees, attorneys,โ and โany person \nwho are in active concert or participation with them.โ Id. at 14. Defendants subsequently filed an \nopposition to a preliminary injunction and sought clarification on the scope of the upcoming \nhearing, see Dkt. 32, 40, but never sought any clarification of the clear sweep of the TRO. See \nMcComb v. Jacksonville Paper Co., 336 U.S. 187, 192 (1949) (noting parties could have sought \nโclarification or construction of the orderโ). \nInstead, Florida law enforcement officers proceeded to make an unknown number of \narrests under the enjoined provisions. For example, on April 16, 2025, Juan Carlos Lopez-\nGomez, a U.S. citizen, was arrested by the Florida Highway Patrol under S.B. 4Cโs illegal entry \nprovision during a traffic stop, despite presenting valid identification. See, e.g., Ex. F. Plaintiffs \nbecame aware of two other specific arrested individuals, and received information about as many \nas 13 arrests in just one judicial districtโalmost all performed by the Florida Highway Patrol. \n  2 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 4 of 17\nTr. 12:3-7, Dkt. 50. That number is likely a dramatic undercount, as FHP operates throughout \nFloridaโs 67 counties. \nPlaintiffs raised these arrests with the Court during the preliminary injunction hearing on \nApril 18, 2025, and Defendants took the position that the TRO does not bind any law \nenforcement agents in Florida. The Court extended the TRO, making explicit that it binds all law \nenforcement officers in the State. Dkt. 49 at 1. It also required the State to provide notice to all \nsuch officers. Id. at 2. The Attorney General issued two seemingly contradictory letters to law \nenforcement, the second of which appears to invite officers to ignore the Courtโs Order. Ex. A \n(โI cannot prevent you from enforcing [S.B. 4C,] where there remains no judicial order that \nproperly restrains you from doing so . . . it is my view that no lawful, legitimate order currently \nimpedes your agencies from continuing to enforceโ S.B. 4C). \nThe Court ordered supplemental briefing regarding the proper scope of the preliminary \ninjunction should the Court order one. Dkt. 49 at 2. Defendants filed a brief contending that the \nCourt is powerless to enjoin law enforcement officers under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2). Dkt. 56 \n(โSupp. Br.โ). \nARGUMENT \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(d)(2) provides that a courtโs injunction may bind not \nonly โthe partiesโ but also โthe partiesโ officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneysโ as \nwell as โother persons who are in active concert or participation withโ the parties or their agents. \nThis provision codifies the common law rule that courts may prevent enjoined parties from \ncircumventing injunctions. Regal Knitwear Co. v. NLRB, 324 U.S. 9, 14 (1945). The Eleventh \nCircuit has explained that Rule 65(d) โembodies, rather than limits the common law powers of \nthe district court.โ Robinson, 83 F.4th at 878 (citation omitted); see also United States v. Hall, \n472 F.2d 261, 267 (5th Cir. 1972) (similar). A courtโs jurisdiction over nonparties who violate its \ninjunctive order is โnecessary to the proper enforcement and supervision of a courtโs injunctive \nauthority and offends no precept of due process.โ Waffenschmidt v. MacKay, 763 F.2d 711, 716 \n(5th Cir. 1985); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 71 (procedure for enforcing an order โagainst a \nnonpartyโ subject to it โis the same as for a partyโ).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit has accordingly recognized that under Rule 65(d), injunctions may \napply to five categories of people and organizations: (1) the parties; (2) the partiesโ officers, \nagents, servants, employees, and attorneys; (3) other persons who are in active concert or \n  3 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 5 of 17\nparticipation with the parties or their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys; (4) \nothers in โprivityโ with the parties, including โnonparties otherwise legally identifiable with the \nenjoined partyโ; and (5) โthose who aid and abet those in privity with an enjoined party.โ \nRobinson, 83 F.4th at 878-79 (cleaned up). \nIn the context of this caseโa challenge to the validity of a state statute brought against \nthe Attorney General and prosecutors across the stateโlaw enforcement agencies easily fit \nwithin several of these categories, any one of which is sufficient for an injunction in this case to \nbind them. First, law enforcement agencies are in active concert and participation with \nDefendants because the arrests they make are a condition precedent to, and can only be justified \nby reference to, prosecutions under S.B. 4C. Indeed, if prosecutors may not prosecute purported \nviolations of S.B. 4C, the arrests are unlawful. Second, they are in privity with Defendants \nbecause, in this challenge to the validity of a state statute, law enforcement agencies and \nprosecutors have identical interests: enforcing and defending the facial validity of state law. \nThird, for similar reasons law enforcementโs arrests aid and abet prosecutions under S.B. 4C. \nAnd fourth, at least in the context of this case, law enforcement officers are Defendantsโ agents \nbecause Attorney General Uthmeier has exercised control over their immigration-related \nactivities. Thus, an injunction in this case properly covers law enforcement agencies.  \nIndeed, in comparable cases across the country, federal courts have enjoined criminal \nstatutes without naming law enforcement. See, e.g., Farmworker Assโn of Fla. v. Moody, 734 F. \nSupp. 3d 1311, 1344 (S.D. Fla. 2024) (enjoining โDefendants and their officers, agents, servants, \nemployees, and attorneysโand others in active concert or participation with them.โ); Idaho Org. \nof Res. Councils Inc. v. Labrador, No. 25-cv-00178, ECF No. 16 at 9 (D. Idaho Mar. 27, 2025) \n(โCourt enters a TRO preserving the status quo by prohibiting Defendants and their officers, \nagents, employees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation with \nthem from enforcing the [challenged statute].โ);United States v. Iowa, 737 F. Supp. 3d 725, 751 \n(S.D. Iowa 2024) (โDefendants are hereby ENJOINED from enforcing Senate File 2340 pending \nfurther proceedings.โ), vacated as moot, No. 24-2265, 2025 WL 1140834 (8th Cir. Apr. 15, \n2025); United States v. Oklahoma, 739 F. Supp. 3d 985, 1007 (W.D. Okla. 2024) (โOklahoma is \nhereby ENJOINED from enforcing H.B. 4156 pending further proceedings.โ); Valle del Sol Inc. \nv. Whiting, No. 10-cv-1061, 2012 WL 8021265, at *7 (D. Az Sept. 5, 2012) (โpreliminarily \nenjoining the enforcement ofโ challenged statute), affโd, 732 F.3d 1006 (9th Cir. 2013). On \n  4 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 6 of 17\nDefendantsโ view, those ordersโeach of which was (like this Courtโs TRO) predicated in part on \nthe harms of arrestsโwere nullities as to any future arrests. That cannot be and is not correct. \nThe implications of Defendantsโ argument are dramaticโthreatening to render scores of \ninjunctions toothless. In cases challenging the validity of state criminal laws, courts routinely \nextend injunctions to law enforcements officers who are not parties to the suit. See, e.g., Am. \nBooksellers Assโn, Inc. v. Webb, 590 F. Supp. 677, 693 (N.D. Ga. 1984) (โLikewise, the Attorney \nGeneralโs appearance in this case clearly served to represent the rights and interests of other \nsubordinate state law enforcement officials, not named as parties to this action, who might seek \nto enforce the challenged Act. Accordingly, these state law enforcement officials also will be \nbound by the Courtโs injunction, and plaintiffs will thus enjoy state-wide interim relief from \nenforcement of the Act's display provisions.โ); Ind. C.L. Union Found., Inc. v. Superintendent, \nInd. State Police, 470 F. Supp. 3d 888, 909 n.9 (S.D. Ind. 2020) (โThe Court finds that all law \nenforcement agencies and prosecutors in Indiana are acting in concert with the parties in the \nenforcement of [the invalid statute], and that this Order and the preliminary injunction applies to \nthose entities as well.โ); Rhode v. Bonta, 713 F. Supp. 3d 865, 888 (S.D. Cal. 2024) (enjoining \nfrom implementing a law โAttorney General . . . and those duly sworn state peace officers and \nfederal law enforcement officers who gain knowledge of this injunction order or know of the \nexistence of this injunction orderโ); Doe #1 v. Lee, No. 16-cv-02862, 2021 WL 1264433, at *2 \nn.1 (M.D. Tenn. Apr. 5, 2021) (noting that โother agencies and law enforcement officers will \nneed to abide by this injunction once they are provided noticeโ); Doe v. Harris, No. C12-5713, \n2013 WL 144048, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 7, 2012) (noting that order applies โto all California \nstate and local law enforcement officersโ) (citation omitted). Such orders reflect the settled \nprinciple that courts may enjoin those necessary to prevent ongoing enforcement of \nunconstitutional laws, even if they are not formally named as parties. \nI.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE IN ACTIVE CONCERT AND \nPARTICIPATION WITH DEFENDANTS. \nThe Supreme Court has long made clear that Rule 65โs โin active concert or \nparticipationโ provision is essential to prevent enjoined parties from nullifying judicial orders by \nacting through others. Regal Knitwear Co., 324 U.S. at 14. Without this safeguard, injunctions \nwould be rendered hollow, courts would be powerless to enforce compliance, and equitable \nauthority would collapse into an empty formality. Rule 65(d)(2) ensures that injunctions bind not \nonly the named parties but also, with notice, those who are in active concert or participate in the \n  5 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 7 of 17\nenjoined conduct. Courts have repeatedly recognized that binding nonparties in this way is not an \nexception to due process but a necessary feature of effective judicial relief. Robinson, 83 F.4th at \n884.  \nThere can be no doubt that under the plain text of the Rule, law enforcement acts in both \nactive concert and participation with the defendant prosecutors and Attorney General. โConcertโ \nmeans โagreement in a design or plan.โ Jeffers v. United States, 432 U.S. 137, 149 (1977). \nโParticipationโ means โtaking part in something.โ Participation, Merriam Websterโs Dictionary. \nImportantly, these terms do not require that an enjoined party exercise direct control over the \nthird party. See Blackard v. Memphis Area Med. Ctr. for Women, Inc., 262 F.3d 568, 576 (6th \nCir. 2001) (โIt is not necessary that the enjoined party control the third party in order for the third \nparty to be bound by the injunction.โ); Harris, 2013 WL 144048, at *12 (โEven if the Attorney \nGeneral does not have absolute control and direction over local law enforcement, it cannot be \ndisputed that, as to the [challenged conduct], local law enforcement at least acts โin active \nconcert or participation withโ the Attorney General, if not as her agent.โ). \nFlorida law enforcementโs arrests under S.B. 4C are textbook examples of active concert \nand participation. Arrests and prosecutions are not separate, independent eventsโthey are linked \nstages in the enforcement of criminal statutes. Indeed, โ[a]n arrest is the initial stage of a criminal \nprosecution.โ Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 26 (1968). Without an arrest, there can be no \nprosecution; without prosecution, the statute cannot be enforced. Arresting individuals under \nS.B. 4C directly advances the common goal of enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and thus \nis in clear violation of the order under Rule 65. Likewise, an arrest for a violation of S.B. 4C can \nonly be justified by reference to a future prosecution; police have no free-floating power to arrest \nfor crimes independent of criminal prosecutions. See Williams v. Dart, 967 F.3d 625, 634 (7th \nCir. 2020) (โIt is axiomatic that seizures have purposes. When those purposes are spent, further \nseizure is unreasonable . . . [a]t the time of the founding and still today, the primary purpose of \nan arrest is to ensure the arrestee appears to answer charges.โ). And this Court has already \nrecognized that arrests and prosecutions under S.B. 4C are coordinated harms. Dkt. 28 at 5 \n(โ[T]here is a realistic probability that Individual Plaintiffs could be subject to arrest and \nprosecution under S.B. 4-C.โ). \nFloridaโs institutional design eliminates any doubt. Floridaโs Constitution and statutes \ncreate an integrated framework in which arrests by law enforcement lead to prosecution by state \n  6 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 8 of 17\nattorneys to achieve the Stateโs objective of enforcing statutes like S.B. 4C. See Fla. Const. art. \nV, ยง 17 (State Attorneys prosecuting officers of trial courts); Fla. Stat. ยง 27.02(1) (State \nAttorneys prosecute criminal cases on behalf of the state); id. ยง 16.56(1)(a) (Attorney General \nand Statewide Prosecutor prosecute state crimes). Law enforcement officers making arrests \nunder S.B. 4C are not acting independently; they are integral stages in the Stateโs enforcement \nmachinery. \nThe specific statutory authorities applicable to immigration arrests only sharpen the point. \nThe Florida Department of Law Enforcement (โFDLEโ)โan agency overseen by the Governor \nand Cabinet, including the Attorney Generalโโshall coordinate and direct the law enforcement . \n. . responses . . . to immigration enforcement incidents within or affecting this state.โ Id. \nยง 943.03(14) (emphasis added); Fla. Const. art. IV, ยง 4(a) (Cabinet composed of the Attorney \nGeneral, among others); Fla. Stat. ยง 20.201(1) (establishing the Governor and Cabinet as head of \nFDLE). S.B. 4C is precisely the type of immigration enforcement initiative contemplated by this \nmandate, and the Attorney Generalโthrough his role in jointly overseeing FDLEโexercises \ndirect authority over law enforcementโs implementation of such immigration statutes.1  \nA similar structure governs the Florida Highway Patrol (โFHPโ), which is within the \nDepartment of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles (โDHSMVโ)โan agency overseen by the \nGovernor and Cabinet, including the Attorney General. See Fla. Const. art. IV, ยง 4(a) (Cabinet \ncomposed of the Attorney General, among others); Fla. Stat. ยง 20.24(1) (establishing the \nGovernor and Cabinet as head of DHSMV); id. ยง 20.24(2)(a) (establishing FHP within \nDHSMV). FHPโs arrests under S.B. 4C are thus not the product of independent plans, but rather \nreflects coordinated steps within a unified enforcement apparatus.  \nDefendants do not grapple with the obvious application of the Ruleโs terms. Instead, they \ntry to narrow the meaning of the Rule to cover only those in privity and who aid and abet named \nparties. Supp. Br. 9. As explained below, the Courtโs Order is proper under those standards. But, \nregardless, Defendants cite no case that has ever so held, particularly in the context of a suit \nagainst governmental defendants and seeking to bind other governmental defendants. \n \n1 Defendants rely on Support Working Animals, Inc. v. Governor of Florida, 8 F.4th 1198, 1204 \n& n.4 (11th Cir. 2021), Supp. Br. 6 n.2, but that case confirmed that the Attorney General was \nโone of several heads of the FDLE,โ and merely held that the Attorney General had neither \nenforced nor threatened to enforce the challenged gambling statute. Support Working Animals, \nInc., 8 F.4th at 1204 & n.4. That reasoning has no application here. \n  7 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 9 of 17\nRather, the language Defendants cite in cases like Robinson address the idea that Rule \n65(d)(2) may have more limited application when it comes to private persons being bound by an \norder to which they are not a party and who might raise questions of due process. See Robinson, \n83 F.4th at 881, 884 (discussing whether private persons have had their โday in courtโ); Supp. \nBr. 15 (Plaintiffsโ interpretation โmakes a mockery of due processโ); id. at 9-10. But here, the \ninjunction binds only state and local governmental officials in their official capacities. And as the \nSupreme Court has long held, a suit against a government official in their official capacity โis not \na suit against the official but rather is a suit against the officialโs office,โ and thus โis no different \nfrom a suit against the State itself.โ Will v. Mich. Depโt of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71 (1989). \nBecause Plaintiffs here sued numerous state officers to bar enforcement of a state statute, there is \nno due process problem with enjoining other state officers from doing so as well. This Courtโs \norders against nonparty state officers are likewise ultimately orders against the State itself. Lewis \nv. Clarke, 581 U.S. 155, 162 (2017). And the State, of course, has had and will continue to have \nfull procedural opportunities to contest this Courtโs rulings. In any event, the State has no \nconstitutional right to due process. See South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-24 \n(1966) (rejecting stateโs Due Process argument).  \nThe Tenth Circuitโs decision in American Civil Liberties Union v. Johnson illustrates this \npoint. 194 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir. 1999). In that suit against the Governor and Attorney General, \nnonparty district attorneys challenged their inclusion in an injunction, urging that they โreceived \nno notice of, nor have they participated in, this action.โ Id. at 1163. The Court easily rejected the \nidea that those government officers had a separate right to a day in court, noting that โ[t]his \naction is a facial challenge to a New Mexico statute, brought against the governor and attorney \ngeneral of New Mexico in their official capacities,โ and thus โis an action against the State of \nNew Mexico.โ Id. The court had no need to look beyond the plain language of the Rule when it \ncame to binding official-capacity state officers in a facial challenge to a state law. So too here: \nFlorida law enforcement officers arresting under S.B. 4C are acting in active concert and \nparticipation with Defendants and are properly bound by the Courtโs Order. See also Jacobson v. \nFla. Secโy of State, 974 F.3d 1236, 1255 (11th Cir. 2020) (indicating, in context of governmental \ndefendant and nonparties, that a district court may enjoin โnonparties โwho are in active concertโ \nwith a defendantโ); Harris, 2013 WL 144048, at *12 (applying plain text of rule to government \nnonparties); Entergy Nuclear Vt. Yankee, LLC v. Shumlin, No. 1:11-CV-99 JGM, 2013 WL \n  8 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 10 of 17\n121016, at *2 (D. Vt. Jan. 9, 2013) (distinguishing between application of Rule 65 to private and \ngovernmental nonparties). \nIn short, law enforcement arrests under the enjoined provisions of S.B. 4C are not \nisolated or discretionary acts. They are indispensable acts that form part of a coordinated state \npolicyโa common design and plan with Defendantsโto enforce an unconstitutional statute. \nLaw enforcement agencies and officers fall squarely within Rule 65โs โin active concert or \nparticipationโ provision, and they are bound by this Courtโs injunction.  \nII.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE IN PRIVITY WITH THE \nENJOINED DEFENDANTS AND ACTED TO ADVANCE THEIR \nINTERESTS.  \nEven if privity were required, it is satisfied here. Defendants argue otherwise, contending \nthat law enforcement agencies are โseparate legal entitiesโ over which Defendants have no \ncontrol. Supp. Br. 11. But even if that were trueโwhich it is not, see infraโprivity does not \nrequire formal agency or control. It simply requires that law enforcement agencies be \nrepresented, which is clearly the case here given that this lawsuit challenges the constitutionality \nof a state law. The challenge is really against the State and is defended by the Stateโs Attorney \nGeneral. See Regal Knitwear Co., 324 U.S. at 14 (injunction โnot only binds the [] defendant[s] \nbut also those . . . represented by themโ).  \nโโPrivityโ is a flexible legal term, comprising several different types of relationships.โ \nEEOC v. Pemco Aeroplex, Inc., 383 F.3d 1280, 1286 (11th Cir. 2004) (explaining that privity \nโcan arise in a number of circumstancesโ). For the purposes of determining whether an \ninjunction binds a nonparty, privity exists where it โwould be reasonable to conclude that [the \npartyโs] rights and interests have been represented and adjudicated in the original injunction \nproceeding.โ ADT LLC v. NorthStar Alarm Servs., LLC, 853 F.3d 1348, 1352 (11th Cir. 2017). \nThat standard is easily satisfied in this case: a challenge to the constitutionality of a state \nstatute. As explained above, this suit against Defendants in their official capacities is effectively \na suit against the State itself. See Summit Med. Assocs., P.C. v. Pryor, 180 F.3d 1326, 1336 (11th \nCir. 1999) (Ex parte Young โdoctrine has, . . . . been described as a legal โfictionโ because it \ncreates an imaginary distinction between the state and its officersโ). Law enforcement officers in \ntheir official capacities are likewise representatives of the State exercising the powers of the \nState; they have no โrights and interestsโ in the enforcement of the challenged law apart from \nthose already represented here. ADT, 853 F.3d at 1352. Moreover, Plaintiffsโ claims are that the \n  9 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 11 of 17\nstate statute is facially unconstitutional. So law enforcement officers would have no arguments to \nmake that would be any different from those advanced by Defendants. Indeed, Defendants are \nrepresenting those officers in seeking to limit the Courtโs injunction. And they notably offer no \nactual arguments or interests that diverge from those of the State already advanced in this \nlitigationโthat is, the interest in enforcing S.B. 4C as much as possible.2  \nDefendants instead argue that prosecutors are generally not in privity with arresting \nofficers because the prosecutorโs interest is โthat justice shall be done,โ while โofficers have little \nif any direct interest in prosecution.โ Supp. Br. 12 & n.6 (internal quotation marks omitted). But \nDefendantsโ cited cases involve a very different context: lawsuits against arresting officers in \ntheir personal capacity for damages under ยง 1983. See, e.g., Wilson v. Attaway, 757 F.2d 1227, \n1236-37 (11th Cir. 1985); Hargis v. City of Orlando, 586 F. Appโx 493, 498 (11th Cir. 2014) \n(both cited by Defendants). In these cases, the arresting officer (as an individual human, rather \nthan as an official representative of the state) has a uniquely personal interest in a damages case \nagainst them in their personal capacity. And the arresting officer does not stand in privity with \nthe prosecutor in the criminal prosecution because โ[p]rosecutors represent the interests of the \npeople . . . not the interests of the arresting police officer,โ and police officers have no greater \ninterest in the outcome of criminal proceedings โthan any other citizen of [the] state.โ Hargis, \n586 F. Appโx at 498 (citation omitted). Thus, Defendantsโ cases are inapposite.  \nIn sum, Defendants provide no reason why, under the circumstances of this challenge to \nthe validity of a state law, law enforcementโs interests would not be represented. Nor could \ntheyโindeed, surely the Stateโs Attorney General is an adequate representative of the state itself, \nwhich is the true defendant of interest here. Accordingly, the injunction binds law enforcement \nagencies and officers. Regal Knitwear Co., 324 U.S. at 14 (injunction not only binds defendants \nbut also those represented by them).  \nIII.  LAW ENFORCEMENT AID AND ABET ENFORCEMENT OF S.B. 4C. \nRule 65(d)(2) also includes those who aid, abet, cooperate with, or facilitate the enjoined \nconduct. Regal Knitwear Co., 324 U.S. at 14; Robinson, 83 F.4th at 885; ADT, 853 F.3d at 1352. \nDefendants attempt to cabin this rule by importing rigid notions of criminal accomplice liability \ninto civil injunction proceedings. Supp. Br. 13-14. But this approach misapprehends fundamental \n \n2 To the extent any law enforcement agencies and officers had additional or different arguments, \nthey could always file an amicus brief.  \n  10 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 12 of 17\nprinciples of civil aiding and abetting law. \nIndeed, as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, civil aiding \nand abetting does not import all the immutable components of its criminal counterpart. 598 U.S. \n471, 486 (2023) (citing Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 489 (D.C. Cir. 1983)). Rather, civil \nliability turns not on rigid criminal frameworks but on whether the nonparty โconsciously, \nvoluntarily, and culpably participate in or support the relevant wrongdoing.โ Id. at 505.  \nFlorida law enforcement officers here plainly participated in violating this Courtโs \ninjunction by arresting individuals under the enjoined provisions of S.B. 4C. Each arrest could \nonly be justified as a predicate to prosecution under the enjoined lawโbut such prosecution \nwould, of course, require a party defendant to directly violate the Courtโs injunction, supra. By \ninitiating the enforcement chain, law enforcement sought to induce and further violations of the \nCourtโs injunction by the party Defendants. See Twitter, 598 U.S. at 506 (explaining that aiding \nand abetting attaches when assistance materially furthers wrongful acts); Goya Foods, Inc v. \nWallack Mgmt. Co., 290 F.3d 63, 75 (1st Cir. 2002) (โthe challenged action must be taken for the \nbenefit of, or to assistโ). \nMoreover, the Attorney General, through his joint role overseeing the FDLE, has clear \nauthority to direct the law enforcement response to S.B. 4C. Yet he has failed to exercise that \nauthority to bring state law enforcement into compliance. To the contrary, the Attorney General \nhas seemingly encouraged continued enforcement of the enjoined provisions, issuing a letter to \nlaw enforcement agencies declaring his โview that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes \nyour agencies from continuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal entry and reentry laws.โ Ex. A. \nFinally, Defendantsโ reliance on Alemite Mfg. Corporation v. Staff is misplaced. Supp. \nBr. 14. That case stands for the proposition that an injunction may not โenjoin the world at largeโ \nabsent aiding and abetting. 42 F.2d 832, 832-33 (2d Cir. 1930). But the Court has not sought to \ndo so; rather, it has barred the Stateโs officers from enforcing an unconstitutional statute. Where, \nas here, law enforcement officers assist in the enforcement of an invalidated statute, they fall \nwell within Rule 65(d)(2).3 See Waffenschmidt, 763 F.2d at 714 (holding nonparties aided and \n \n3 Jacobson is of no help to Defendants. It confirmed that โa district court may bind nonparties \nโwho are in active concertโ with a defendantโ so long as โa plaintiff validly invokes federal \njurisdiction by satisfying the traceability and redressability requirements of standing against a \ndefendant.โ 974 F.3d at 1255. There, the Court found a lack of standing against the named \nofficial. Id. Here, as the Court already held, Plaintiffs have standing. \n  11 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 13 of 17\nabetted enjoined parties); Reliance Ins. Co. v. Mast Const. Co., 84 F.3d 372, 377 (10th Cir. 1996) \n(similar). \nIV.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE DEFENDANTSโ AGENTS AND \nSERVANTS. \nFinally, in the context of this case, law enforcement officers are Defendantsโ agents and \nservants because Defendants exercise control over their conduct. See Regal Knitwear Co., 324 \nU.S. at 14 (injunction binds โthose . . . subject to [Defendantsโ] controlโ).  \nFlorida law requires that โany official responsible for directing or supervising [state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies] shall use best efforts to support the enforcement of federal \nimmigration law.โ Fla. Stat. ยง 908.104(1). In Defendantsโ view, S.B. 4C constitutes an effort to \nassist in the enforcement of federal immigration law. Dkt. 40 at 1 (asserting S.B. 4C โaid[s] the \nUnited States in curbing illegal immigrationโ). And contrary to Defendantsโ contention that they \nlack โthe power to disciplineโ local law enforcement, Supp. Br. 7, Florida law allows the \nAttorney General to suspend and to file suit against a local law enforcement agency officers for \ndeclaratory or injunctive relief for a violation of these provisions. Fla. Stat. ยง 908.107(2).  \nRelying on these laws, the Attorney General has repeatedly threatened local officials who \nfail to fully embrace immigration enforcement, even threatening to remove these officials from \noffice. See, e.g., Ex. C (claiming mayor had violated Florida laws described above and \nthreatening that โ[f]ailure to abide by state law may result in the enforcement of applicable \npenalties, including but not limited to being held in contempt, declaratory or injunctive relief, \nand removal from office . . . .โ); Ex. D (claiming city council had violated Florida laws described \nabove and making same threats of being held in contempt, declaratory or injunctive relief, and \nremoval from office); Ex. G (threatening that if a local official โtakes action to impede or prevent \nlaw enforcement from . . . get[ting] these people back where they came from, then I do believe \nthe law is violated and that there will be penalties for thatโ). \nAdditionally, Defendant Uthmeier exercises control over whether law enforcement \nenforces an invalid law because, as Floridaโs โchief state legal officer,โ Fla. Const. art. IV ยง 4, \nthe Attorney General โ[g]ives an official opinion and legal advice in writing on any question of \nlaw[,]โ Fla. Stat. ยง 16.01. Indeed, in this very case, the Attorney General wrote to all law \nenforcement agencies on April 18, 2025 requesting that they โplease instruct [their] officers and \n  12 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 14 of 17\nagents to comply with [this Courtโs] directives.โ Ex. B.4 Just days later, on April 23, 2025โand \nprior to this Court issuing any ruling on these issuesโthe Attorney General sent a follow-up \nletter expressing his โview that no lawful, legitimate order currently impedes . . . agencies from \ncontinuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal entry and reentry laws.โ Ex. A. These letters only \nunderscore Defendantsโ authority and control over law enforcement agencies and their \nenforcement of the statute at issue here. Thus, Defendants exercise control over law enforcement. \nV.  LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS ARE LIABLE FOR ARRESTING \nUNDER AN ENJOINED LAW. \nFinally, it is worth noting the implication of Defendantsโ position for law enforcement \nofficers themselves. Law enforcement may detain or arrest individuals only when supported by \nreasonable suspicion or probable cause of a crime. See Skop v. City of Atlanta, 485 F.3d 1130, \n1137 (11th Cir. 2007) (stating reasonable suspicion and probable cause require โbelief that the \nsuspect had committed or was committing a crimeโ). But this Court enjoined S.B. 4Cโs illegal \nentry and reentry provisions because they were preempted and thus are now โwithout effect.โ \nMaryland v. Louisiana, 451 U.S. 725, 746 (1981) (โIt is basic to this constitutional command \nthat all conflicting state provisions be without effect.โ); Irving v. Mazda Motor Corp., 136 F.3d \n764, 767 (11th Cir. 1998) (โstate law that conflicts with federal law is without effect.โ (citation \nomitted)). Arrests under those enjoined provisions are therefore not just properly barred by this \nCourtโs orders under Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(2); they are also unconstitutional. Courts have long \nrecognized that arrests made pursuant to enjoined or invalidated statutes violate the Fourth \nAmendment because such statutes cannot furnish probable cause. See Michigan v DeFilippo, 443 \nU.S. 31, 38 (1979) (โPolice are charged to enforce laws until and unless they are declared \nunconstitutional.โ); Cooper v. Dillon, 403 F.3d 1208, 1223 (11th Cir. 2005) (enforcing an \nunconstitutional state statute โcaused the deprivation of [plaintiffโs] constitutional rightsโ).  \nFurthermore, arrests on probable cause of a crime are only reasonable if the officer can \nexpect that a prosecution for that crime may follow. After all, the entire point of criminal arrests \nare for criminal prosecutions. If the police know that no prosecution will follow, because all such \nprosecutions statewide are barred by this Courtโs order, then the basis for arrest disappears and it \nbecomes a Fourth Amendment violation. See Williams, 967 F.3d at 634. \n \n4 States attorneys named as Defendants in this case have similarly instructed law enforcement to \nrefrain from enforcing S.B. 4C. See Ex. E.  \n  13 \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 57   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/26/2025   Page 15 of 17\nLaw enforcement officers executing arrests under S.B. 4C are therefore acting without \nlegal authority and in direct violation of the Fourth Amendment. Yet Defendants seemingly \nencouraged law enforcement to proceed with such arrests by asserting that nothing โimpedes \n[law enforcement] agencies from continuing to enforce Floridaโs new illegal entry and reentry \nlaws.โ Ex. A. Defendantsโ irresponsible conduct appears to invite a wave of unlawful arrests, \ncivil rights violations, and inevitable litigation. The Court should put an end to this once and for \nall. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should conclude that all orders it has issued and may issue can properly apply \nto all law enforcement officers in Florida. \n \nDate: April 26, 2025    Respectfully submitted, \n \n    /s/ Amien Kacou  \nCody Wofsy*  Amien Kacou (FL Bar No. 44302) \n \nSpencer Amdur*  Amy Godshall (FL Bar No. 1049803) \n   \nHannah Steinberg*  Daniel B.

This action challenges Floridaโs Senate Bill 4-C (โS.B. 4Cโ), now codified at Fla. Stat. ยงยง \n811.101-.103 (2025), which purports to give Florida state officials unprecedented power to arrest, \ndetain, and prosecute noncitizens in the State of Florida.  Under this novel system, the State of \nFlorida has created its own immigration crimes, completely outside the federal immigration \nsystem.  State police will arrest noncitizens for these entry and re-entry crimes; state prosecutors \nwill bring charges in state courts; and state judges will determine guilt and impose sentences.  The \nfederal government has no control over, nor any role at all in, these arrests and prosecutions.  \n2.  S.B. 4C violates the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  Immigration is \na quintessentially federal authority.  Congress has created a carefully calibrated immigration \nsystem  over  time,  engaging  in  debate  and  grappling  with  nuances  to  produce  the  detailed \nprovisions governing peopleโs entry into the United States and their right to remain here.  And \nCongress placed all the relevant tools and decision-making authority in the hands of federal \nofficialsโin  keeping  with  the  federal  governmentโs  well  established  exclusive  immigration \npowers and the sensitive foreign policy implications of these powers.  \n3.  S.B.  4C  jettisons  this  system,  grasping  control  over  immigration  from  the  federal \ngovernment and giving State officers the power to prosecute immigration crimes on their own.  In \ndoing so, S.B. 4C declares the State off-limits to entire categories of immigrants, many of whom \nhave or are seeking federal permission to be in the United States.  \n4.  S.B. 4C also violates the Commerce Clause because it impermissibly regulates peopleโs \nentry into Florida, and it imposes unacceptable burdens on interstate and foreign commerce.  \n5.  Plaintiffs  hereby  file  this  complaint  for  declaratory  and  permanent  injunctive  relief.  \nPlaintiffs  will  seek  a  temporary  restraining  order  and  a  preliminary  injunction  to  enjoin \n1 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 4 of 18\nenforcement of S.B. 4C immediately.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n6.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1331.  \n7.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of Florida because a substantial portion of the \nrelevant events occurred or will occur in the District and a substantial number of Plaintiffs are \nlocated in the District.  28 U.S.C. ยง 1391(b).  Defendants are sued in their official capacity.  Each \nDefendant resides within the State of Florida.   \nPARTIES \nA.  Plaintiffs \n8.  Plaintiff Farmworker Association of Florida, Inc. (โFWAFโ) is a non-profit organization \nwith headquarters in Apopka, Florida and offices throughout the state, including in Homestead, \nFellsmere, Immokalee, and Pierson.   \n9.  FWAF is a grassroots and community-based membership organization with nearly 12,000 \nmembers.    \n10.  FWAFโs mission is to support and to build power among farmworkers and rural low-\nincome communities. FWAFโs programs focus primarily on encouraging farmworkersโ civic \nparticipation, building farmworker coalitions, supporting workersโ rights, improving working \nconditions, advocating for immigrantsโ rights, and safeguarding farmworkersโ health and safety.  \n11.  FWAF serves seasonal workers, most of whom are immigrants who travel to Florida with \nthe seasons to harvest crops.  To do so, FWAFโs members travel back and forth between Florida, \nGeorgia, and Alabama, crossing back into Florida multiple times per year.  \n12.  FWAFโs members include individuals who would be subject to prosecution under S.B. 4C.  \nThey will be directly affected by the disruption, uncertainty, and fear created by S.B. 4C.  \n2 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 5 of 18\n13.  Many of these members entered the United States without inspection and now have a wide \nrange of immigration statuses and histories.  For example, FWAF members include: naturalized \ncitizens, asylees, lawful permanent residents (โLPRโ), humanitarian parole recipients, holders of \na visa for temporary agricultural workers (โH-2A visaโ), recipients of Deferred Action for \nChildhood Arrivals (โDACAโ), holders of Temporary Protected Status (โTPSโ), recipients of \nSpecial Immigrant Juvenile Status (โSIJSโ), former unaccompanied minors who were released to \nrelatives or sponsors and were permitted to stay in the United States under the custody of the Office \nof Refugee Resettlement (โORRโ), federal protection beneficiaries, such as persons covered under \nthe Violence Against Women Act (โVAWAโ), holders of a visa for Victims of Human Trafficking \n(โT visaโ), holders of a visa for Victims of Criminal Activity (โU visaโ), and persons possessing \norders to withhold and/or defer their removal.  \n14.  FWAF members also include people who have submitted applications for a wide range of \nimmigration benefits and relief that have yet to be resolved, people who are currently in removal \nproceedings, people who have been released from federal custody with and without federal notices \nto appear in immigration court, and people who entered unlawfully and have not subsequently had \ncontact with federal immigration authorities.  \n15.  FWAF member W.A. is a 36-year-old national of Mexico who lives in Apopka, Florida.  \nW.A. lives with her two U.S. citizen children, who are 8 and 13.  She entered the United States \nwithout inspection in 2003, when she was 17 years old, and has lived in the country continuously \nsince then.  W.A. generally travels outside of Florida on occasion for holidays, including Christmas \nand spring break, and then returns to Florida.  She fears being arrested under S.B. 4Cโs Illegal \nEntry provision and fears having to be separated from her children. \n16.  Individual Plaintiff V.V. is a 35-year-old national of Guatemala who lives in Immokalee, \n3 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 6 of 18\nFlorida and is a member of FWAF.  She lives with her husband and her U.S.-citizen children, who \nare 1, 3, 7, and 14 years old.  V.V. was previously deported, and she last reentered the United \nStates without inspection in 2014.  She fears being arrested under S.B. 4Cโs Illegal Reentry \nprovision and is deeply concerned about being separated from her husband and U.S.-citizen \nchildren.   \n17.  Plaintiff  Florida  Immigrant  Coalition  (โFLICโ)  is  a  non-profit  organization  with \nheadquarters in Miami, Florida and team members throughout the state, including in Broward, \nPalm Beach, Orange, Osceola, and Duval.   \n18.  FLIC is a grassroots and community-based membership organization with nearly more than \n100 individual members and 85 member organizations.    \n19.  FLICโs mission is to grow the connection, capacity, and consciousness of communities to \nstrengthen pro-immigrant power in Florida.  FLIC is dedicated to strengthening community ties, \nenhancing capabilities, and raising awareness to increase the impact of pro-immigrant initiatives \nacross Florida that help our neighbors, community, and friends.  \n20.  FLICโs members travel back and forth between Florida and other states for myriad reasons, \nincluding work, visits to family members, and travel.  \n21.  FLICโs members include individuals who would be subject to prosecution under S.B. 4C.  \nThey will be directly affected by the disruption, uncertainty, and fear created by S.B. 4C.  \n22.  Many of these members entered the United States unlawfully and now have a wide range \nof immigration statuses and histories.  For example, FLIC members include: naturalized citizens, \nasylees, LPRs, humanitarian parole recipients, H-2A visa holders, recipients of DACA, TPS \nholders, recipients of SIJS, former unaccompanied minors who were released to relatives or \nsponsors and were permitted to stay in the U.S. under the custody of ORR, federal protection \n4 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 7 of 18\nbeneficiaries, such as persons covered under VAWA, holders of T visas, holders of U visas, and \npersons possessing orders to withhold and/or defer their removal.  \n23.  FLIC members also include people who have submitted applications for a wide range of \nimmigration benefits and relief that have yet to be resolved, people who are currently in removal \nproceedings, people who have been released from federal custody with and without federal notices \nto appear in immigration court, and people who entered unlawfully and have not subsequently had \ncontact with federal immigration authorities.  \n24.  FLIC members also include organizations whose members, in turn, include individuals \nwho would be subject to prosecution under S.B. 4C.  They will be directly affected by the \ndisruption, uncertainty, and fear created by S.B. 4C.   \n25.  FLIC members also include organizations that serve immigrants, whose daily operations \nwill be upended by S.B. 4C. S.B. 4C will force these organizations to divert significant resources \nfrom existing programs. S.B. 4C will strain already scarce resources and staff capacity, make the \norganizationsโ work more costly and difficult, require additional funding and personnel, divert \nresources to entirely new lines of work, and hinder client communication and services that are \ncentral to the organizationsโ activities. S.B. 4C will significantly burden the organizationsโ abilities \nto fulfill their missions through their programs and activities.  \n26.  Individual Plaintiff Y.M. is a 40-year-old citizen of Honduras.  She lives in Gainesville, \nFlorida with her U.S.-citizen son, who is a minor with a disability.  She is a member of FLIC. \n27.  Y.M. entered the United States without inspection more than twenty years ago and has not \nleft the United States since that time.  She submitted a U visa application in 2022, which is still \npending.   \n28.  Y.M. leaves Florida about twice per year on family vacations; her family recently traveled \n5 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 8 of 18\nto Georgia.  She is worried about the risk of arrest or detention under S.B. 4Cโs Illegal Entry \nprovision.  If detained under S.B. 4C, she fears that she will be separated from her U.S.-citizen \nchild, who has a disability, for whom she is the primary caretaker and provider. \n29.  Individual Plaintiff V.V. is also a member of FLIC.   \nB.  Defendants \n30.  Defendant James Uthmeier is the Attorney General of Florida, the chief legal officer of the \nState.  Fla. Const. art. IV, ยง 4(b).  He is sued in his official capacity.  In that capacity, he is \nresponsible for the enforcement of S.B. 4C.  The Attorney General is required to appear in the \ncourts on behalf of the State of Florida. Fla. Stat. ยง 16.01(4).  Under Florida law, the office of \nAttorney General also encompasses the Office of Statewide Prosecution.  Fla. Const. art. IV ยง 4(b).  \nThis office has concurrent jurisdiction with state attorneys to prosecute alleged violations of certain \ncriminal laws, including violations of S.B. 4C.  See id.; Fla. Stat. ยง 16.56(1)(a)(15).  \n31.  Defendant Nicholas B. Cox is the Statewide Prosecutor of the State of Florida, appointed \nby Defendant Attorney General Uthmeier.  See Fla. Const. art. IV ยง 4(b); Fla. Stat. ยง 16.56(2).  \nThe Statewide Prosecutor has concurrent jurisdiction with state attorneys to prosecute alleged \noffenses,  including  violations  of  S.B.  4C.    See  Fla.  Stat  ยง  16.56(1)(a)(15).    As  Statewide \nProsecutor, Defendant Cox has the power to, among other duties, โconduct hearings at any place \nin the state; summon and examine witnesses; require the production of physical evidence; sign \ninformations, indictments, and other official documents; [and] confer immunity.โ  Fla. Stat. ยง \n16.56(3).   \n32.  Defendants  State  Attorneys  Ginger  Bowden  Madden,  Jack  Campbell,  John  Durrett, \nMelissa W. Nelson, William Gladson, Bruce Bartlett, R.J. Larizza, Brian S. Kramer, Monique H. \nWorrell, Brian Haas, Katherine Fernandez Rundle, Ed Brodsky, Susan S. Lopez, Larry Basford, \n6 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 9 of 18\nAlexcia Cox, Dennis W. Ward, Harold F. Pryor, William Scheiner, Thomas Bakkedahl, and Amira \nD. Fox are the state attorneys for the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, \nNinth,  Tenth,  Eleventh,  Twelfth,  Thirteenth,  Fourteenth,  Fifteenth,  Sixteenth,  Seventeenth, \nEighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Judicial Circuits of Florida, respectively.  They are proper \ndefendants because they are the prosecuting officers of all trial courts in their respective circuits.  \nFla. Const. art. V, ยง 17.   \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA. Legal Background: Comprehensive Federal Immigration System  \n33.  The federal government has exclusive power over immigration.  See, e.g., Arizona v. \nUnited States, 567 U.S. 387, 394-95 (2012).  \n34.  Congress has created a comprehensive system of federal laws regulating and enforcing \nimmigration in the Immigration and Nationality Act (โINAโ).  See 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101 et seq.โฏ  \n35.  Federal immigration statutes and the associated implementing regulations and precedential \nadministrative law decisions form an exceptionally detailed, complex, and finely reticulated \nregulatory regime. Congress has frequently amended the relevant provisions of the INA, including \nby passing particularly significant legislation in 1952, 1965, 1980, 1986, 1990, 1996, 2000, 2001, \n2005, and 2008, along with dozens of other Acts modifying the immigration regime in countless \nways.  Immigration legislation is proposed in every single Congress and frequently forms a point \nof major national debate.  \n36.  The INA contains complex and exclusive procedures for determining immigration and \ncitizenship status and for determining whether an individual may lawfully enter and remain in the \nUnited States, either temporarily or permanently.  See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. ยง 1229a(a)(3).  Under federal \nlaw, there is no single, readily ascertainable category or characteristic that establishes whether a \n7 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 10 of 18\nparticular person may or may not be permitted to enter or to remain in the United States.  The \nanswer to that question can only be reached through the processes outlined in the INA and may \ndepend on the discretionary determinations of federal officials.  \n37.  Many people who enter the United States between ports of entry ultimately obtain federal \nauthorization to remain in the United States temporarily, indefinitely, or permanently.  \n38.  Congress  has  established  that  entry  into  the  United  States  is  a  crime  under  certain \ncircumstances.  8 U.S.C. ยง 1325 (โImproper Entry by Alienโ) provides criminal penalties for \nnoncitizens who, inter alia, enter the United States at any time or place other than as designated by \nimmigration officers.  Similarly, 8 U.S.C. ยง 1326 (โReentry of Removed Aliensโ) provides \ncriminal penalties for noncitizens who reenter the United States without authorization after entry \nof an order of removal.  \n39.  Prosecution for the federal entry and reentry crimes are matters of federal discretion.  \nFederal agents and policymakers may choose to deploy these toolsโor notโfor a wide range of \nreasons,  including  national  priorities,  migration  patterns,  international  relationships,  and \nhumanitarian concerns.  \nB. S.B. 4C  \n40.  On February 13, 2025, Governor Ron DeSantis signed S.B. 4C into law.  It went into effect \nimmediately.  \n41.  S.B. 4C created two new state law offenses: โIllegal Entry by Adult Unauthorized Alien \nInto This Stateโ and โIllegal Reentry of an Adult Unauthorized Alien.โ  S.B. 4C ยงยง 3-4 (codified \nat Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102-.103).  \n42.  Each of these offenses can only be committed by an โunauthorized alien,โ which S.B. 4C \ndefines as any person who is โunlawfully present in the United States according to the terms of the \n8 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 11 of 18\nfederal Immigration and Nationality Act.โ  S.B. 4C ยงยง 3(1), 4(1) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยงยง \n811.102(1), 811.103(1)); Fla. Stat. ยง 908.111(1)(d).  \n43.  A noncitizen who is 18 years of age or older commits a violation of โIllegal Entryโ if he or \nshe โknowingly enters or attempts to enter this state after entering the United States by eluding or \navoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers.โ  S.B. 4C ยง 2(1) (codified at Fla. Stat. \nยง 811.102(1)).  \n44.  โ[A]ffirmative  defense[s]  to  prosecutionโ  for  โIllegal  Entryโ  exist  if  (1)  the  federal \ngovernment has granted the noncitizen lawful presence in the United States or discretionary relief \nthat authorizes the noncitizen to remain in the United States temporarily or permanently; or (2) the \nnoncitizen is subject to relief under the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966; or (3) the noncitizenโs \nentry into the United States did not constitute a violation of 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325(a).  S.B. 4C ยง 3(4) \n(codified  at  Fla.  Stat.  ยง  811.102(4)).    The  statute  does  not  define  โlawful  presenceโ  or \nโdiscretionary relief.โ  \n45.  A noncitizen is also exempt from arrest for โIllegal Entryโ if he or she โwas encountered \nby law enforcement during the investigation of another crime that occurred in this state and the \nunauthorized alien witnessed or reported such crime or was a victim of such crime.โ  S.B. 4C ยง \n3(3) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.102(3)).  \n46.  S.B. 4C does not provide a defense for people currently seeking asylum, other humanitarian \nprotection, or any other relief available under federal law.   \n47.  A first violation of โIllegal Entryโ is a misdemeanor of the first degree punishable by a \nmandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 9 months.  A second subsequent violation is a felony \npunishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 1 year and 1 day.  Any subsequent \nviolation is a felony punishable by a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 2 years.  S.B. \n9 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 12 of 18\n4C ยง 3(1)-(2) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.102(1)-(2)).  \n48.  S.B. 4C also created a crime of โIllegal Reentry.โ  This provision makes it a crime if a \nnoncitizen who is 18 years or older โenters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in this stateโ \nafter they have been โdenied admission, excluded, deported, or removed, or ha[ve] departed the \nUnited States during the time an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding.โ  S.B. \n4C ยง 4(1) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(1)).  \n49.   A noncitizen is not subject to the โIllegal Reentryโ provision if they are located outside \nthe  United  States  and  (1)  the  U.S.  Attorney  General  has  โexpressly  consented  to  [their] \nreapplication for admissionโ; or (2) they were โnot required to obtain such advance consent under \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act.โ  S.B. 4C ยง 4(1) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(1)).  \n50.  A violation of โIllegal Reentryโ is a felony punishable by a mandatory minimum term of \nimprisonment of 1 year and 1 day. S.B. 4C ยง 4(2) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(2)).  A noncitizen \nis subject to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of 2 years if they have three or more \nprior convictions for a misdemeanor or a felony, and 5 years if they have a prior conviction for a \nforcible or aggravated felony.  S.B. 4C ยง 4(3) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยง 811.103(3a)).  \n51.  Noncitizens arrested for โIllegal Entryโ or for โIllegal Reentryโ must be detained pending \ndisposition of the case.  S.B. 4C ยงยง 3(5), 4(4) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102(5), 811.103(4)).  \n52.  Noncitizens charged with or convicted of either provision are not eligible for a โcivil \ncitation, prearrest or post arrest diversion program, or other similar program[s].โ  S.B. 4C ยงยง 3(6), \n4(5) (codified at Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102(6), 811.103(5)); Fla. Stat. ยงยง 901.41, 921.00241.  \n53.  Upon a noncitizenโs arrest for โIllegal Entryโ or โIllegal Reentry,โ the arresting law \nenforcement agency must notify and provide information to: (1) Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement (โICEโ) and (2) the Department of Law Enforcement.   S.B. 4C ยงยง 3(7), 4(6) (codified \n10 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 13 of 18\nat Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102(7), 811.103(6)).  \n54.  S.B. 4C applies statewide, without any exception.  \n55.  S.B. 4Cโs new state system to regulate immigration completely bypasses and conflicts with \nthe federal system.   \n56.  S.B. 4C requires state officers to make complex determinations of federal immigration \nstatus, and to arrest and to detain people who are convicted of the new state crimesโall without \nany direction, input, or involvement whatsoever from federal officials.   \n57.  S.B. 4C does not make any exception for people who entered the country unlawfully but \nhave since begun the process of obtaining federal immigration status, even for those whom the \nfederal immigration system has authorized to remain in the country.  \n58.  The law will subject thousands of immigrants who enter Florida, including asylum seekers \nand immigrants applying for other federal immigration benefits and status, to criminal punishment.  \nBy subjecting these categories of immigrants to criminal punishment, S.B. 4C effectively banishes \nlarge categories of immigrants whose immigration cases are pending, and to whom the federal \ngovernment may eventually grant lawful status, permanent residence, and citizenship.   \n59.  As explained above, the harms of S.B. 4C will be felt acutely by the Individual Plaintiffs, \nwho are subject to prosecution and to imprisonment under the law, as well as FWAF and FLIC, \nwhose membership includes individuals who are subject to prosecution and to imprisonment under \nthe law.  \nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n60.  FWAF, FLIC, and the Individual Plaintiffs bring this action under Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure 23(a) and 23(b)(2) on behalf of themselves and two classes of other persons similarly \nsituated.   \n11 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 14 of 18\n61.  FWAF, FLIC, and the Individual Plaintiffs seek to represent the following two classes: (1) \nThe Entry Class: any person not a citizen or national of the United States who may now or in the \nfuture enter or attempt to enter the state of Florida after entering the United States by eluding or \navoiding examination or inspection by immigration officers; and (2) The Reentry Class: any person \nnot a citizen or national of the United States who may enter, attempt to enter, or be found in the \nstate of Florida after the person has been denied admission to or excluded, deported, or removed \nfrom the United States; or has departed from the United States while an order of exclusion, \ndeportation, or removal was outstanding.  \n62.  The proposed classes satisfy the requirements of Rule 23(a)(1) because each respective \nclass is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.  Hundreds if not thousands of \nnoncitizens  will  be  subjected  to  arrest,  detention,  and  prosecution  under  S.B.  4C  and  its \nimplementation by Defendants.  The proposed classes also include numerous future noncitizens \nwho will enter Florida and will be subjected to S.B. 4C.   \n63.  The  proposed  classes  satisfy  the  commonality  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)(2).    The \nmembers of the respective classes are subject to a common practice: arrest, detention, and \nprosecution under S.B. 4C contrary to the Supremacy Clause and/or Commerce Clause.  The suit \nalso raises questions of law common to members of the proposed classes, including whether S.B. \n4C and its implementation violate the Supremacy Clause and/or Commerce Clause as to the Entry \nClass and the Reentry Class.  \n64.  The proposed classes satisfy the typicality requirements of Rule 23(a)(3), because the \nclaims of the representative Individual Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of their respective \nclasses.  Additionally, FWAF and FLIC represent the claims of their members, and those membersโ \nclaims are typical of the claims of the classes.  Each proposed class member, including the \n12 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 15 of 18\nrepresentative Individual Plaintiffs and FWAF and FLIC members, will experience or face the \nsame principal injury (arrest, detention, and prosecution), based on the same government practice \n(S.B. 4C and its implementation), which is unlawful as to the respective classes because it violates \nthe Supremacy Clause and/or Commerce Clause.  \n65.  The  proposed  classes  satisfy  the  adequacy  requirements  of  Rule  23(a)(4).    The \nrepresentative Plaintiffs seek the same relief as the other members of their respective classesโ\namong other things, an order declaring S.B. 4C unlawful and an injunction preventing enforcement \nof S.B. 4C.  In defending their rights and the rights of their members, the representative Plaintiffs \nwill defend the  rights  of all proposed  class  members in their respective classes fairly and \nadequately.  \n66.  The proposed classes are represented by experienced attorneys from the American Civil \nLiberties Union Foundation Immigrantsโ Rights Project, the American Civil Liberties Union \nFoundation of Florida, and Americans for Immigrant Justice.  Proposed Class Counsel have \nextensive experience litigating class action lawsuits and other complex systemic cases in federal \ncourt on behalf of noncitizens, including cases asserting very similar claims to the claims asserted \nhere.  \n67.  The proposed classes also satisfy Rule 23(b)(2).  Defendants will act on grounds generally \napplicable to the classes by subjecting them to arrest, detention, and prosecution under S.B. 4C.  \nInjunctive and declaratory relief is therefore appropriate with respect to the respective classes as a \nwhole.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nClaim One: Preemption; Equity \n(Against all Defendants) \n \n68.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above and incorporate them by reference as \n13 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 16 of 18\nthough fully set forth herein.  \n69.  The Supremacy Clause, Article VI, Section 2, of the U.S. Constitution provides that โ[t]his \nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all \nTreaties made, or which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the \nsupreme Law of the Land.โ  \n70.  Federal law preempts state law in any area over which Congress expressly or impliedly has \nreserved exclusive authority or which is constitutionally reserved to the federal government, or \nwhere state law conflicts or interferes with federal law.   \n71.  S.B. 4C violates the Supremacy Clause because it attempts to regulate matters that are \nexclusively reserved to the federal government and because it operates in a field over which \nCongress has exercised exclusive authority.   \n72.  S.B. 4C further violates the Supremacy Clause because it conflicts with federal laws, \ncontradicts federal admission and release decisions, imposes burdens and penalties not authorized \nby and contrary to federal law, creates its own immigration classifications, and directs state officers \nto take unilateral immigration enforcement actions.  \n73.  Plaintiffs may sue to obtain injunctive relief against S.B. 4C in equity.  \nClaim Two: Commerce Clause; Equity; 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 \n(Against all Defendants) \n \n74.  Plaintiffs repeat and reallege all paragraphs above and incorporate them by reference as \nthough fully set forth herein.  \n75.  The Constitution gives Congress the power โ[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, \nand among the several States.โ  U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3.  The Commerce Clause not only gives \nCongress this power, but also bars states from interfering with Congressโs regulation of interstate \ncommerce.โฏ  \n14 \n \n\n \nCase 1:25-cv-21524-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/02/2025   Page 17 of 18\n76.  S.B. 4C violates the Commerce Clause because it impermissibly regulates peopleโs entry \ninto Florida and their movement across state borders. It therefore imposes unacceptable burdens \non interstate commerce.โฏ  \n77.  Plaintiffs may sue to obtain injunctive relief against S.B. 4C in equity and under 42 U.S.C. \nยง 1983.   \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE Plaintiffs request that the Court grant the following relief:โฏ  \na.  Declare that the entry and reentry provisions of S.B. 4C are unlawful;โฏ  \nb.  Preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants from enforcing the entry and reentry \nprovisions of S.B. 4C;โฏโฏ  \nc.  Require Defendants to direct their officers, agents, and employees to cease enforcement \nof S.B. 4Cโs entry and reentry provisions;  \nd.  Grant Plaintiffsโ costs of suit, reasonable attorneysโ fees, and other expenses pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. ยง 1988; and  \ne.  Grant any other and further relief that this Court may deem fit and proper.โฏโฏ \n \nDate: April 02, 2025      Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Amy Godshall  \nCody Wofsy*  Amy Godshall (FL Bar No. 1049803)  \n   \nSpencer Amdur*  Daniel B.

This form, approved by the Judicial Conference of the United States in September 1974, is \nrequired for the use of the Clerk of Court for the purpose of initiating the civil docket sheet.  Consequently, a civil cover sheet is submitted to the Clerk of \nCourt for each civil complaint filed.  The attorney filing a case should complete the form as follows: \nI.(a)  Plaintiffs-Defendants.  Enter names (last, first, middle initial) of plaintiff and defendant.  If the plaintiff or defendant is a government agency, use   \nonly the full name or standard abbreviations. If the plaintiff or defendant is an official within a government agency, identify first the agency and then \nthe official, giving both name and title.\n   (b) County of Residence.  For each civil case filed, except U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county where the first listed plaintiff resides at the \ntime of filing. In U.S. plaintiff cases, enter the name of the county in which the first listed defendant resides at the time of filing. (NOTE: In land \ncondemnation cases, the county of residence of the \"defendant\" is the location of the tract of land involved.) \n   (c) Attorneys.  Enter the firm name, address, telephone number, and attorney of record.  If there are several attorneys, list them on an attachment, noting  \nin this section \"(see attachment)\". \nII.    Jurisdiction.  The basis of jurisdiction is set forth under Rule 8(a), F.R.Cv.P., which requires that jurisdictions be shown in pleadings.  Place an \"X\" \nin one of the boxes. If there is more than one basis of jurisdiction, precedence is given in the order shown below. \nUnited States plaintiff.  (1) Jurisdiction based on 28 U.S.C. 1345 and 1348.  Suits by agencies and officers of the United States are included here. \nUnited States defendant.  (2) When the plaintiff is suing the United States, its officers or agencies, place an \"X\" in this box. \nFederal question.  (3) This refers to suits under 28 U.S.C. 1331, where jurisdiction arises under the Constitution of the United States, an amendment \nto the Constitution, an act of Congress or a treaty of the United States. In cases where the U.S. is a party, the U.S. plaintiff or defendant code takes \nprecedence, and box 1 or 2 should be marked. \nDiversity of citizenship.

BACKGROUND \nOn February 13, 2025, Florida Senate Bill 4-C (โS.B. 4-Cโ) went into effect. S.B. 4-\nC creates two new state law offenses: โIllegal Entry by Adult Unauthorized Alien into This \nStateโ and โIllegal Reentry of an Adult Unauthorized Alien.โ Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102โ.103. \nSection 811.102(1) prohibits any โunauthorized alien who is 18 years of age or olderโ2 \nfrom โknowingly enter[ing] or attempt[ing] to enterโ Florida โafter entering the United \n \n1 Plaintiffs have personally served Defendants James Uthmeier, Nicholas B. Cox, and \nJack Campbell. (DE 23 at 1.) Plaintiffs have conferred with Arthur I. Jacobs, who purports \nto represent all state attorney Defendants, and sent him copies of the Complaint, Motion \nfor TRO, and all other filings thus far via email. (Id.) This, along with the facts contained \nwithin the declarations attached to Plaintiffsโ Class Action Complaint (DE 1), fulfills the \nprocedural requirements for issuance of a TRO. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(1).  \n2 An โunauthorized alienโ is defined as anyone unlawfully present in the United States \nunder the Immigration and Nationality Act and any other applicable federal law. Fla. Stat. \nยง 811.101(2) (referring to section 908.111). \nPage 1 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 2 of 14\nStates by eluding or avoiding examination or inspection by immigration officersโ (โillegal \nentryโ). A first conviction for illegal entry is a first-degree misdemeanor, requiring a \nmandatory  minimum  sentence  of  nine  monthsโ  imprisonment,  while  subsequent \nconvictions are felonies with escalating mandatory minimum sentences. Fla. Stat. ยง \n811.102(1)โ(3). Under subsection 811.103(1), an adult โunauthorized alienโ commits a \nthird-degree felony, if they โenter[], attempt[] to enter, or [are] at any time found inโ Florida \nafter โhaving been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or having departed \nthe United States during the time an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is \noutstandingโ (โillegal reentryโ). Importantly, the scheme requires courts to presume that \nโno conditions of release can reasonably assure the presenceโ of any individual arrested \nunder either provision and to order their detention without bond pending disposition of the \ncase. Fla. Stat. ยงยง 811.102(5), 811.103(4).   \nOn April 2, 2025, Plaintiffs filed a Class Action Complaint (DE 1) (โComplaintโ), \nseeking injunctive relief barring enforcement of S.B. 4-C by state and local officials and a \ndeclaration  that  the  law  violates  the  United  States  Constitutionโs  Supremacy  and \nCommerce Clauses. (DE 1 at 17.) Plaintiffs include individuals V.V. and Y.M. (collectively \n(โIndividual Plaintiffsโ), who allege they are at risk of arrest and prosecution under the \nstatute,  and  two  grassroots  membership  organizations,  Farmworker  Association  of \nFlorida,  Inc.  (โFWAFโ)  and  Florida  Immigrant  Coalition  (โFLICโ)  (collectively \nโOrganizational Plaintiffsโ), which support members who are similarly at risk.3 (Id. ยถยถ 8, \n \n3 Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification (DE 5), seeking certification of two classes \nwith individuals potentially subject to the โillegal entryโ and โillegal reentryโ provisions of \nS.B. 4-C. (DE 5 at 1.) That motion is pending before the Court.   \nPage 2 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 3 of 14\n11โ24, 26โ28.)  On the same day, Plaintiffs sought a TRO pausing enforcement of S.B. \n4-C pending the Courtโs consideration of their request for a preliminary injunction. (DE 4.)  \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nRule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure authorizes courts to grant a \npreliminary injunction or temporary restraining order before final judgment in limited \ncircumstances. The purpose of this injunctive relief is to โpreserve the status quo until the \n[Court] renders a meaningful decision on the merits.โ Schiavo ex rel. Schindler v. Schiavo, \n403 F.3d 1223, 1231 (11th Cir. 2005). The primary difference between a preliminary \ninjunction and TRO is that a TRO โmay be entered before the defendant has an adequate \nopportunity to respond.โ Dragados USA, Inc. v. Oldcastle Infrastructure, Inc., No. 20-cv-\n20601, 2020 WL 733037, at *2 (S.D. Fla. Feb. 13, 2020). As such, the duration of a TRO \nis limited to fourteen days, absent an extension for good cause. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  \nTo merit a TRO, as with a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs must show:  \n(1) a substantial likelihood of success on the merits; (2) that the [TRO] is \nnecessary  to  prevent  irreparable  injury;  (3)  that  the  threatened  injury \noutweighs the harm the [TRO] would cause the other litigant; and (4) that \nthe [TRO] would not be averse to the public interest. \n \nGissendaner v. Commโr, Ga. Dept. of Corr., 779 F.3d 1275, 1280 (11th Cir. 2015) \n(quoting Wellons v. Commโr, Ga. Dept. of Corr., 754 F.3d 1260, 1263 (11th Cir. \n2014)); see also Windsor v. United States, 379 F. Appโx 912, 916โ17 (11th Cir. \n2010) (explaining that โthe four criteria for obtaining a preliminary injunction are \nidentical to those for issuance of a temporary restraining orderโ). Plaintiffs bear \nโthe burden of persuasion to clearly establish all four of these prerequisites.โ Wreal, \nLLC v. Amazon.com, Inc., 840 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir. 2016).  \n    \nPage 3 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 4 of 14\nIII.  DISCUSSION \nAs a preliminary matter, the Court must address Plaintiffsโ standing to seek their \nrequested relief. See Farmworker Assโn of Fla. v. Moody, 734 F. Supp. 3d 1311, 1321 \n(S.D. Fla. 2024) (deciding the โthreshold matterโ of the plaintiffsโ standing before reaching \nthe merits of their preliminary injunction request). Next, the Court will discuss why the four \nfactors relevant to injunctive relief favor granting a TRO in this case.  \nA. Plaintiffs have standing to bring this action. \nPlaintiffs who invoke โthe jurisdiction of a federal court bear[] the burden to show \nโ(1) an injury in fact, meaning an injury that is concrete and particularized, and actual or \nimminent, (2) a causal connection between the injury and the causal conduct, and (3) a \nlikelihood that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.โโ CAMP Legal Def. \nFund, Inc. v. City of Atlanta, 451 F.3d 1257, 1269 (11th Cir. 2006) (quoting Granite State \nOutdoor Advert., Inc. v. City of Clearwater, 351 F.3d 1112, 1116 (11th Cir. 2003)).  \nโInjury in fact reflects the statutory requirement that a person be adversely affected \nor aggrieved, and it serves to distinguish a person with a direct stake in the outcome of a \nlitigationโeven though smallโfrom a person with a mere interest in the problem.โ Arcia \nv. Fla. Sec'y of State, 772 F.3d 1335, 1340 (11th Cir. 2014) (quoting United States v. \nStudents Challenging Regul. Agency Procs., 412 U.S. 669, 689 n.14 (1973)). An injury-\nin-fact  is  โan  invasion  of  a  legally  protected  interest  which  is  (a)  concrete  and \nparticularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.โ Lujan v. Defs. \nof Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (citations omitted). \n \n  \nPage 4 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 5 of 14\n1.  Individual Plaintiffs \nV.V. is a FWAF member who was previously deported and last reentered the \nUnited States without inspection in 2014. (DE 1 ยถ 16.) She now lives in Florida with her \nhusband and her four U.S.-citizen children. (Id.) Y.M. is a FLIC member living in Florida, \nwho entered the United States without inspection more than twenty years ago. (Id. ยถยถ 26โ\n27.) Y.M. leaves Florida twice a year with her minor U.S.-citizen son who has a disability. \n(Id. ยถยถ 26โ27.) Individual Plaintiffs argue that they are at imminent risk of arrest and \ndetention as they are subject to prosecution and imprisonment under the language of S.B. \n4-C. (Id. ยถ 59.) โWhen the harm alleged is prospective, as it was here, a plaintiff can satisfy \nthe injury-in-fact requirement by showing imminent harm. While the threatened future \ninjury cannot be merely hypothetical or conjectural, probabilistic harm is enough.โ Arcia, \n772 F.3d at 1341 (citations omitted). As law enforcement agencies in Florida have already \nmade several arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C, the Court finds that there is a realistic \nprobability that Individual Plaintiffs could be subject to arrest and prosecution under S.B. \n4-C. It is irrelevant that they have not yet been arrested or prosecuted: โWhen an \nindividual  is  subject  to  [the  threatened  enforcement  of  a  law],  an  actual  arrest, \nprosecution, or other enforcement action is not a prerequisite to challenging the law.โ \nSusan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 158 (2014). Consequently, Individual \nPlaintiffs have sufficiently established an injury-in-fact for standing purposes.  \n2.  Organizational Plaintiffs \nFor the reasons discussed, infra, the Court finds that Individual Plaintiffs have \nstanding. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the Court to engage in a full standing analysis \nof the claims made by Organizational Plaintiffs. See Greater Birmingham Ministries v. \nPage 5 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 6 of 14\nSecโy of State for State of Alabama, 992 F.3d 1299, 1317 (11th Cir. 2021); see also \nGlassroth v. Moore, 335 F.3d 1282, 1293 (11th Cir. 2003) (โHaving concluded that those \ntwo plaintiffs have standing, we are not required to decide whether the other plaintiff . . . \nhas standing.โ). But see Farmworker Assโn of Fla., 734 F. Supp. 3d at 1328 (finding \nfarmworker association had organizational standing to challenge alien transportation law \nbecause the lawโs enforcement would impair the organizationโs ability to engage in its \nprojects and divert resources to counteracting the lawโs effects). \n3.  Traceability & Redressability \nFinally, โ[w]hen traceability and redressability are at stake, the key questions are \nwho caused the injury and how it can be remedied.โ City of S. Miami v. Governor, 65 F.4th \n631, 640 (11th Cir. 2023). Here, the injury is arrest and prosecution under S.B. 4-C. \nPlaintiffs  contend  that  Defendant  Attorney  General  of  Florida  and  the  remaining \nDefendants are empowered to enforce S.B. 4-C. (DE 1 ยถ 30โ32.) Therefore, at this \njuncture, Plaintiffsโ threatened arrest and prosecution are traceable to Defendants based \non their general authority to enforce and bring prosecutions under the criminal laws of \nFlorida. See Georgia Latino All. for Human Rts. v. Governor of Georgia, 691 F.3d 1250, \n1260 (11th Cir. 2012) (โGLAHRโ) (plaintiffsโ risk of arrest and prosecution under criminal \nlaw was traceable to passage of the bill and redressable by an injunction).    \nTo determine redressability, the Court focuses โon whether the injury that a plaintiff \nalleges is likely to be redressed through the litigation.โ Sprint Commcโns Co., L.P. v. APCC \nServs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 287 (2008) (emphasis in original). โ[I]t must be the effect of the \ncourtโs  judgment  on  the  defendantโnot  an  absent  third  partyโthat  redresses  the \nplaintiffโs injury, whether directly or indirectly.โ Lewis v. Governor of Alabama, 944 F.3d \nPage 6 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 7 of 14\n1287, 1301 (11th Cir. 2019) (citations omitted). Defendants are state officials tasked with \nthe enforcement of S.B. 4-C and empowered to prosecute individuals who do not comply \nwith the law. As Defendantsโ authority to enforce S.B. 4-C causes Plaintiffsโ injuries, \nenjoining Defendants from doing so will directly redress those injuries. Put another way, \nPlaintiffsโ requested reliefโan order declaring the entry and reentry provisions of S.B. 4-\nC to be unlawful and enjoining Defendantsโ from enforcing those provisionsโwill directly \nredress Plaintiffsโ reasonable fear that the challenged law will be enforced against them \nor their members by Defendants. Given that Plaintiffs have standing, the Court will \naddress the remainder of the factors governing their TRO request.  \nB. Plaintiffs have fulfilled the criteria for issuance of a TRO \nIn order to obtain a TRO, Plaintiffs must establish the four prerequisites noted \nsupra p. 3. The Court addresses each.  \n1.  Likelihood of success on the merits \nPlaintiffs argue S.B. 4-C violates the Supremacy Clause by creating a statutory \nscheme in an area exclusively reserved for the federal government that conflicts with \nexisting federal immigration law and its enforcement. (DE 4 at 5); see U.S. Const. art. VI \n(making federal law the โsupreme Law of the Landโ). Plaintiffs further contend that S.B. \n4-C runs afoul of the Commerce Clauseโs implicit limitation on statesโ power to restrict the \ninterstate movement of people. (DE 4 at 14); see U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3 (giving \nCongress the power to โregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribesโ). The Court agrees that, at this early stage, Plaintiffs \nhave shown they are likely to succeed on the merits. \n   \nPage 7 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 8 of 14\na.  Supremacy Clause  \nStates are preempted under the Supremacy Clause โfrom regulating conduct in a \nfield that Congress, acting within its proper authority, has determined must be regulated \nby its exclusive governance.โ Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 399 (2012) (holding \nthe  field  of  alien  registration  is  field  preempted).  In  1952,  Congress  passed  the \nImmigration and Nationality Act (โINAโ), 8 U.S.C. ยง 1101, et seq., a comprehensive \nframework regulating the entry, presence, and removal of noncitizens. See Patel v. \nGarland, 596 U.S. 328, 331 (2022) (โCongress has comprehensively detailed the rules by \nwhich noncitizens may enter and live in the United States. When noncitizens violate those \nrules, Congress has provided procedures for their removal.โ); GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1263โ\n64 (โT]he federal government has clearly expressed more than a โperipheral concernโ with \nthe entry, movement, and residence of aliens within the United States . . . and the breadth \nof [the INA] illustrates an overwhelmingly dominant federal interest in the field.โ) (holding \nGeorgiaโs statutes criminalizing transporting, moving, harboring, or inducing an illegal \nalien to enter the state were field preempted); see also 8 U.S.C. ยงยง 1325, 1326 (creating \na federal statutory scheme criminalizing illegal entry and reentry into the United States). \nThus, the federal government has exercised its โbroad, undoubted power over the subject \nof immigration and the status of aliens.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 394. As in the areas of alien \nregistration and transportation, the INAโs comprehensive regulation over noncitizen entry \nand reentry likely preempts any state regulation covering the field.  \nProvisions within S.B. 4-C that define illegal entry and reentry through reference \nto federal law,4 or create affirmative defenses where the federal government has given \n \n4 See supra n.2.  \nPage 8 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 9 of 14\nan individual reprieve from deportation or removal,5 do not save the statute. โWhere \nCongress  occupies  an  entire  field  .  .  .  even  complementary  state  regulation  is \nimpermissible.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 401; see also United States v. Texas, 97 F.4th 268, \n286 (5th Cir. 2024) (dismissing Texasโs argument that illegal reentry provisions which \nโmirrorโ the federal equivalent are permissible as โignor[ing] the basic premise of field \npreemptionโthat States may not enter, in any respect, an area the Federal Government \nhas reserved for itself.โ) (internal quotations omitted). \nMoreover, โstate laws are preempted when they conflict with federal law.โ Arizona, \n567  U.S.  at  399.  This  includes  when  compliance  with  both  laws  is  a  โphysical \nimpossibility[,]โ but also when a challenged law simply impedes โthe accomplishment and \nexecution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.โ Id. (first quoting Fla. Lime & \nAvocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S. 132, 142โ43 (1963) and then quoting Hines v. \nDavidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 62 (1941)). For example, even when Arizona imposed a state \nlaw penalty for conduct already proscribed by the federal government, willful failure to \ncomplete  or  carry  an  alien  registration  card,  the  Supreme  Court  concluded  that \nโ[permitting] the State to impose its own penalties for the federal offenses here would \nconflict with the careful framework Congress adopted.โ Arizona, 567 U.S. at 402. The \nstate  could  prosecute  violations  even  when  federal  officials  determined  they  would \nโfrustrate federal policies.โ Id.; see also GLAHR, 691 F.3d at 1265 (โBy confining the \nprosecution of federal immigration crimes to federal court, Congress limited the power to \npursue those cases to the appropriate United States Attorney.โ). Further, inconsistencies \nbetween penalties under the state and federal schemes create a conflict. Arizona, 567 \n \n5 See Fla. Stat. ยง 811.102(4). \nPage 9 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 10 of 14\nU.S. at 402โ03 (state laws precluding a sentence of probation conflicted with federal laws \nallowing probation for the same conduct).  \nS.B. 4-C appears to suffer from the same infirmities as the alien registration law \nstruck down in Arizona. First, it gives state officials authority to prosecute illegal entry or \nreentry in cases where federal actors may choose not to. Even when federal officials \nchoose to commence dual prosecutions under both laws, S.B. C-4โs mandatory detention \nprovision limits federal law enforcement discretion to recommend pre-trial release and \nobstructs federal courtsโ ability to conduct proceedings requiring defendantsโ presence. \nAdditionally, S.B. 4-C requires mandatory prison sentences for state law violations where \nthe INA allows for a fine or probation for the equivalent federal crime. Compare Fla. Stat. \nยง 811.102 (mandating a minimum of a nine-month prison sentence for a first illegal entry \nconviction), with 8 U.S.C. ยง 1325(a) (authorizing a maximum prison sentence of six \nmonths but not mandating any incarceration upon a first improper entry).   \nFinally, across the country, courts have concluded that nearly identical illegal entry \nand  reentry  laws are  likely  preempted  on both  grounds  by federal  immigration  law \ngoverning noncitizen entry. See e.g., United States v. Iowa, 126 F.4th 1334, 1346 (8th \nCir. 2025) (affirming preliminary injunction against Iowaโs illegal entry and reentry law, \nafter holding the law conflicts โwith federal law because it creates a parallel scheme of \nenforcement for immigration law.โ); Texas, 97 F.4th at 287โ88 (holding Texas had not \nshown its illegal entry scheme was not both field and conflict preempted by federal law); \nUnited States v. Oklahoma, 739 F. Supp. 3d 985, 999 (W.D. Okla. 2024) (โ[T]here is \nstrong support for the conclusion that Congress has legislated so comprehensively in the \nfield  of  noncitizen  entry  and  reentry  that  it  left  no  room  for  supplementary  state \nPage 10 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 11 of 14\nlegislation.โ) (internal quotations omitted), appeal filed, No. 24-6144 (10th Cir. 2024); Ex \nParte Temporary Restraining Order, Idaho Org. of Res. Councils Inc. v. Labrador, No. 25-\ncv-00178- AKB (D. Idaho Mar. 27, 2025) (issuing TRO against similar Idaho law), ECF \nNo. 16.  \nIn short, โ[f]or nearly 150 years, the Supreme Court has held that the power to \ncontrol immigrationโthe entry, admission, and removal of noncitizensโis exclusively a \nfederal power.โ Texas, 97 F.4th at 278โ79. Plaintiffs persuasively posit that S.B. 4-C \nunlawfully encroaches upon that power.  \nb.  Commerce Clause  \nPlaintiffs  also  argue  S.B.  4-C  violates  the  Commerce  Clause,  which  gives \nCongress power to โregulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several \nStates, and with the Indian Tribes.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl 3; see (DE 4 at 14). That \npower  โencompasses  the  movement  in  interstate  commerce  of  persons  as  well  as \ncommodities.โ United States v. Guest, 383 U.S. 745, 758โ59 (1966); see also Edwards \nv.  California,  314  U.S.  160,  172  (1941)  (โ[I]t  is  settled  beyond  question  that  the \ntransportation of persons is โcommerceโ, within the meaning of theโ Commerce Clause). \nImplicit in Congressโs power to regulate interstate commerce is an โimplicit or โdormantโ \nlimitation on the authority of the States to enact legislation affecting interstate commerce.โ \nFla. Transp. Servs., Inc. v. Miami-Dade Cnty., 703 F.3d 1230, 1243 (11th Cir. 2012). \nWhen a scheme โdirectly regulates or discriminates against interstate commerceโ it will \nPage 11 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 12 of 14\ngenerally be โstruck down . . . without further inquiry.โ Bainbridge v. Turner, 311 F.3d \n1104, 1109 (11th Cir. 2002).6  \nHere,  Plaintiffs  assert  that  S.B.  C-4  facially  discriminates  against  interstate \ncommerce by criminalizing entry across Floridaโs border only by certain noncitizens. (DE \n4 at 14โ15.) Although the Court has determined that a TRO is appropriate based on \nPlaintiffsโ  preemption  argument,  it  should  be  noted  that  courts  nationwide  have \ndetermined similar statutes violate the dormant Commerce Clause on this basis. E.g., \nEdwards, 314 U.S. at 174, 177 (striking down Californiaโs ban on transportation of \nindigent nonresidents into the state because it had the โplain and sole functionโ of \nrestricting interstate commerce); United States v. Texas, 719 F. Supp. 3d 640, 679 (W.D. \nTex. 2024) (holding โ[o]n its face, [Texasโ illegal entry law] discriminates against foreign \ncommerce,โ so violates the dormant Commerce Clause). Therefore, at this juncture, \nPlaintiffsโ Commerce Clause analysis also supports their request for a TRO.  \n2.  Irreparable injury \nPlaintiffs argue that, absent an immediate pause to enforcement of S.B. 4-C, they will \nsuffer irreparable harm by being placed at risk of arrest, prosecution, and detention under \nan unconstitutional state statute. (DE 4 at 16.) In their Supplemental Response, Plaintiffs \nnote several reports documenting recent arrests pursuant to S.B. 4-C. (DE 23 at 2.) One \nnews source quotes the Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey stating his office was โseeing \ncases like this six to seven times a week.โ Space Coast Daily, First Arrest Made Under \n \n6 A law may be excepted from this nearly per se rule if it is shown to โadvance a local \npurpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.โ \nId. (quoting New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988)). But given \nthat S.B. 4-C basically duplicates existing federal law, it is unlikely Florida can make a \nshowing that its state law version is necessary.  \nPage 12 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 13 of 14\nFloridaโs  New  Immigration  Law  Happens  in  Brevard  County  (Mar.  13,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/D3DQ-UNKA. As discussed, supra pp. 5โ6, the individual Plaintiffsโ \ndeclarations confirm they are at risk of arrest and prosecution given ongoing enforcement \nof  the  S.B.  4-C.  Likewise,  the  Organizational  Plaintiffsโ  declarations  support  the \nconclusion that a subset of their members may be susceptible to the lawโs enforcement. \n(DE 4-2 at 3โ4; DE 4-3 at 3โ4) (attesting to the many FWAF and FLIC members without \ndocumentation who regularly travel between Florida and other states). Because โPlaintiffs \nare under the threat of state prosecution for crimes that conflict with federal law,โ a TRO \nis necessary to mitigate the risk of irreparable harm from S.B. 4-C. GLAHR, 691 F.3d at \n1269.  \n3.  Balance of equities and public interest \nFor similar reasons, the balance of equities and the public interest favors granting a \nTRO. โThese two factors merge when, as here, the government is the opposing party.โ \nFarmworker Assโn of Fla., 734 F. Supp. 3d at 1342. The harm to Defendants from briefly \nsuspending enforcement of S.B. 4-C is minimal, especially given that similar federal \nprovisions already exist and may be enforced against appropriate persons in Florida. \nMore importantly, the Court has already determined Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits, and Defendants have โno legitimate interest in enforcing an unconstitutional law.โ \nHonefund.com Inc. v. Governor, 94 F.4th 1272, 1283 (11th Cir. 2024) (internal quotations \nomitted).  \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the reasons set forth above, it is ORDERED AND ADJUDGED as follows: \n1.  Plaintiffsโ Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order (DE 4) is GRANTED. \nPage 13 of 14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-21524-KMW   Document 28   Entered on FLSD Docket 04/04/2025   Page 14 of 14\n2.  The Court ENTERS a TRO prohibiting Defendants and their officers, agents, \nemployees, attorneys, and any person who are in active concert or participation \nwith them from enforcing SB 4-C, codified as Florida Statutes sections 811.102โ\n.103. This TRO shall last fourteen (14) days from the date of this Order. \n3.  A Preliminary Injunction Hearing is SET for April 18, 2025 at 10:00 a.m. before \nthe Honorable Kathleen M.
