    "summary": "<p>In 2022, the Southern Education Foundation (SEF) was awarded a five-year, discretionary grant by the Department of Education (ED) to operate the Equity Assistance Center-South (EAC-South). This grant was terminated abruptly by President Trump&rsquo;s Executive Order 14173, which directed the ED to terminate funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives. On April 9, 2025, represented by private counsel, the Southern Education Foundation filed this lawsuit against President Donald Trump, the ED, and the Secretary of Education in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman.</p>\r\n<p>The SEF brought three separate claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA): that the grant termination was arbitrary and capricious, that the termination failed to comply with relevant rules, and that it failed to comport with Due Process Procedures. SEF also brought a Fifth Amendment claim, a First Amendment claim and a claim under VI of the Civil Rights Act. Lastly, the SEF brought an ultra vires claim, alleging that the grant termination exceeded the scope of the DOE&rsquo;s authority.</p>\r\n<p>The SEF requested that the court enjoin the Defendants from terminating SEF&rsquo;s EAC-South grant award, from taking adverse action based on the original notice of grant termination, and from withholding any funds owed to SEF under the grant. SEF also sought reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and declaratory relief, asking that the Court declare the grant termination unlawful.</p>\r\n<p>On April 23, 2025, SEF moved for a preliminary injunction and a temporary restraining order. The SEF claimed that it was likely to succeed on the merits, that the Defendants would face minimal harm, and that a preliminary injunction would serve the public interest by allowing SEF to continue desegregation efforts. Defendants opposed by challenging the court&rsquo;s jurisdiction. First, the Defendant argued that SEF&rsquo;s request for reinstatement agreement was a contract claim that belonged in the Court of Federal Claims. Second, Defendants argued that because SEF administratively appealed the Department&rsquo;s termination decision, the grant termination was not a final agency action and could not be brought under the APA.</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, 2025, while the motion for the temporary restraining order was pending, the SEF filed a consent motion to supplement the record. The SEF then filed an amended complaint with leave of the court that alleged it withdrew its administrative appeal before the Department. SEF further alleged that the Department remitted payment of the outstanding balance before the date of EAC-South&rsquo;s grant termination.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Friedman granted the SEF's motion for a preliminary injunction on May 21, 2025. 2025 WL 1453047. The court found that the plaintiff was likely to succeed on the merits of all of its claims as there was no evidence introduced by the ED that would offer a reasonable explanation for the grant termination as a defense. Judge Friedman rejected the defendants&rsquo; claim that the SEF&rsquo;s request for relief sounded in contract law. The court held that the Tucker Act did not require the plaintiff&rsquo;s claims to be channeled through the Federal Court of Claims because SEF&rsquo;s request that the court declare the termination unlawful sounded in the type of relief afforded under the APA. The Court also rejected the argument that the grant termination was not a final agency action as SEF had withdrawn its appeal, and found that the harms alleged by SEF were ripe for judicial review. <em>Southern Education Foundation v. United States Dep. of Ed.</em>, F. Supp. 3d., 2025 WL 1453047 (D.D.C 2025).</p>\r\n<p>The government appealed the preliminary injunction to the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. On September 19, 2025, the government moved to voluntarily dismiss the appeal, which the court granted.</p>",

TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE \nUNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA,  in  his \nofficial capacity;  \nc/o Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica \nU.S. Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20530-0001 \n \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \n \nSUPPLEMENTAL COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n1.  Plaintiff files this Supplemental Complaint pursuant to Rule 15(d) of the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure to allege events that occurred after the original complaint. Specifically, \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 2 of 39\n \nPlaintiff alleges, inter alia, that on May 16, 2025, Plaintiff withdrew its administrative appeal \nbefore the Department of Education. Plaintiff further alleges that the withdrawal of its appeal is \nbeyond the time prescribed in the February 13, 2025, termination letter from the Department of \nEducation, and  thus the termination is considered a final agency action under the General \nEducation Provisions Act and Administrative Procedure Act.  \n2.  Plaintiff further alleges, inter alia, that on May 14, 2025, the Department of \nEducation remitted payment of the outstanding balance of $293,681.78 for expenses incurred on \nor  before  February  13,  2025—the  date  of  the  grant’s  termination.  This  post-complaint \ndisbursement of funds further reinforces that the termination constitutes a final agency action \nsubject to judicial review under the General Education Provisions Act and the Administrative \nProcedure Act. \n3.  This  case  concerns  the  United  States  Department  of  Education’s  (“the \nDepartment”) abrupt and unlawful decision to terminate the Equity Assistance Center for the \nsouthern region (“EAC-South”), grant authorized under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.S.C. 2000c-2 (“Title IV”) and operated by the Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (“SEF”).  \n4.  For nearly a century, African American children were subjected to lawful racial \nsegregation in public education. The U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ruled \nthat racial segregation in public education was unconstitutional and ordered the desegregation of \nour nation’s systems of public education.  \n5.  In Title IV, Congress authorized the Department to provide “technical assistance in \nthe preparation, adoption and implementation plans for the desegregation of public schools.” 42 \nU.S.C.  §2000c-2.  To  advance  this  objective,  and  as  prescribed  by  federal  regulations,  the \nDepartment provides financial assistance to operate regional Equity Assistance Centers (“EACs”) \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 3 of 39\n \nand  awards  these  grants  to  eligible  entities,  including  nonprofit  organizations.  Every  year, \nCongress appropriates funding for training and technical assistance, specifically under Title IV of \nthe  Civil  Rights Act,  and  directs  the  Department  to  distribute  these  funds. After  Congress \nappropriates funds to the Department, and the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) \napportions the funds for training and technical assistance programs. Every year, the Department \nobligates these grant funds to EAC grantees competitively selected for a full twelve-month budget \nperiod. Grantees are permitted to draw down (or spend) previously obligated funds during the \napproved budget period until September 30th of each budget year.  \n6.  However, on February 13, 2025, EAC-South was no longer permitted to spend \nfunds when the Department terminated, abruptly and without notice, EAC-South’s ability to draw \ndown funds previously obligated to SEF and issued a Grant Award Notification (GAN) terminating \nSEF’s grant and project. \n7.  For over 150 years, SEF has advocated for equal education access for all. SEF \neducated formerly enslaved persons following the U.S. Civil War; it built schools, trained teachers, \nand developed education leaders in its efforts to dismantle segregated education. SEF continues its \nwork  by  developing  sound  practices  in  education  administration  and  supporting  leadership \ndevelopment in education. Since its 1867 founding, SEF has remained dedicated to advancing \neducation opportunity.  \n8.  SEF was actively involved in advancing the preparation and implementation of the \nSupreme Court’s landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In the years following the \nBrown decision and amid decades of ongoing civil rights advocacy, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nwas signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Title IV was at the center of SEF’s work, \nwhich empowered federal efforts to desegregate public schools. SEF actively supported and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 4 of 39\n \nadvocated for the enforcement of Title IV to help dismantle the nation’s unconstitutionally racially \nsegregated education system.    \n9.  As  part  of  SEF’s  strategy  to  address  to  the  continuing  harms  of  school \ndesegregation, SEF decided in 2020 to apply for the federal grant to operate the southern region’s \ndesegregation assistance center (or “technical assistance center”), renamed in 2016 as the Equity \nAssistance Center, or here, EAC-South.  In applying for the grant, SEF aimed to resolve remnants \nof segregated education, evidenced at least by the overwhelming number of open federal court \ndesegregation orders in the southern states. SEF intended for the EAC-South to lead the charge on \nremoving remaining impediments to equal access to quality education. \n10.  In 2022, the Department notified SEF that, based on its application, it was awarding \nSEF the grant to operate the EAC-South.  \n11.  Since receiving the grant, SEF has invested significant time and resources into \nbuilding a technical assistance center specifically designed to confront the high concentration of \nunresolved federal school desegregation cases in the southern region. Additionally, the Center \ndelivers research-based, targeted support to public schools still struggling with the lingering effects \nof segregation that continue to limit educational opportunity for students.  \n12.  President Donald J. Trump assumed office on January 20, 2025, and on that same \nday  signed  Executive  Order  14151,  titled  “Ending  Radical  and Wasteful  Government  DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing” (Executive Order 14151). Executive Order 14151 declared that the \nBiden Administration’s intention to support diversity, equity, and inclusion programming was \n“illegal and immoral discrimination.” Executive Order 14151 ordered federal agencies to terminate \n“all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ grants or \ncontracts.”  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 5 of 39\n \n13.  On January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14173, titled \n“Ending  Illegal  Discrimination  and  Restoring  Merit-Based  Opportunity”  (“Executive  Order \n14173” and together with Executive Order 14151, signed on January 20, the “DEI Executive \nOrders”). Similar to Executive Order 14151, this order declared that programs supporting diversity, \nequity, and inclusion “can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation,” and ordered executive \ndepartments and agencies to “terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, \npolicies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and \nrequirements.”  \n14.  The Department issued a letter to SEF on February 13, 2025, abruptly terminating \nfunding for EAC-South (the “Termination Letter”). However, the letter failed to provide any \nexplanation of how EACs generally—or EAC-South specifically—allegedly promoted diversity, \nequity, and inclusion initiatives now considered inconsistent with the Department’s priorities. It \noffered no evidence that EAC-South engaged in any form of unlawful discrimination based on \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic. Nor did it clarify \nhow EAC-South conflicted with Department policy or violated the very federal civil rights laws \nthat authorized and funded its creation. \n15.  The Department’s stated basis for terminating the grant and denying access to \nCongressionally appropriated funds previously obligated to SEF is contrary to the Constitution, \nstatute, and regulations. Moreover, the Department failed to follow applicable statutory due \nprocess procedures. The immediate termination constitutes an agency action that lacks reasoned \ndecision-making  and  is  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  not  in  accordance  with  law  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 6 of 39\n \n16.  The termination of EAC-South’s grant is unlawful, unjustified, and impedes the \nimportant work of assisting school districts to comply with federal civil rights law. Far from \nviolating federal civil rights law, EAC-South–the funding for which is authorized by Title IV–\nenforces the civil right law by helping schools comply with federally mandated desegregation and \nensure equal educational opportunity.  \n17.  This abrupt, unlawful termination doesn’t just harm SEF as the grantee; it harms \nthe public institutions that rely on EAC-South’s services to fulfill their legal obligations to provide \nequitable education for all students. Even more, it directly and immediately harms the students \nwho would otherwise benefit from EAC-South services.  \n18.  The Department’s unlawful termination will force the immediate cessation of \ncritical technical assistance and services, inflicting irreparable harm to SEF and EAC-South, as \nwell as the school districts and communities that rely on their support. The implementation and \nenforcement of the DEI Executive Orders as applied to SEF’s grant and the termination of SEF’s \ngrant must be enjoined to avoid immediate irreparable harm. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n19.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1361. \nThis Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201(a) and 2202. \n20.  Venue is proper in this district because this action is against an officer, employee, \nand/or agency of the United States and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this judicial district. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).   \nPARTIES \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 7 of 39\n \n21.  Plaintiff  Southern  Education  Foundation,  Inc.  is  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit \norganization that has been committed to advancing equitable education policies and practices for \npublic school students across the Southern United States for over 150 years. SEF is organized \nunder the laws of New York and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  \n22.  Defendant  United  States  Department  of  Education  is  a  federal  agency \nheadquartered  in Washington, D.C.,  with  the responsibility  of  providing funding  to  critical \ninstitutions and nonprofits supporting education, like Plaintiff, in the United States.  \n23.  Defendant Linda McMahon is the United States Secretary of Education. She is \nsued in her official capacity.  \n24.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \nA. SEF’s 158-Year History Advancing Desegregation of Schools in the South. \n25.  In the final months of the U.S. Civil War, Congress established the Bureau of \nRefugees,  Freedmen  and Abandoned  Lands  (the  “Freedmen’s  Bureau”)  in  part  to  provide \neducation for persons freed from enslavement by the Union Army. Northern charities soon began \nshipping books and paying to send  teachers to  southern states to support  the work of  the \nFreedman’s Bureau. When the war ended, philanthropies were formed to continue and scale up the \neffort of educating the masses of formerly enslaved persons and poor Whites in the southern states. \nIn 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War, financier George Peabody established the \nPeabody Education Fund to support the establishment of a permanent public education system in \nthe southern U.S. and to grow the number of qualified teachers in the region. Shortly afterwards, \nthe Slater Fund, the Jeanes Fund, the Rosenwald Fund and the Virginia Randolf Fund were \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 8 of 39\n \nestablished with the similar purpose of training teachers, providing books, and building schools \nfor the education of the formerly enslaved persons and poor Whites in the southern states. In 1937, \nthese foundations, with the exception of the Rosenwald Fund, were consolidated to form what is \nnow  the  Southern  Education  Foundation.  Since  1867,  SEF’s  mission  has  been  to  advance \neducational opportunity.1 \n26.  In addition to its role in the development of public education in the South, SEF \nprovided significant assistance to the effort to prove the unconstitutionality of the then-lawful \npractice of segregating public education on the basis of race. SEF provided convening and research \nsupport for Thurgood Marshall and the team of lawyers in preparation for the line of cases leading \nup to Brown v. Board of Education. Notably, a year before the 1954 Brown decision, SEF housed \nresearchers who were compiling a national survey on the conditions of education for African \nAmerican students—work that informed and strengthened the case against segregation. \nB.  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Establishment of Equity Assistance \nCenters. \n \n27.  The Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education did not alleviate all \nbarriers to desegregated public education in the U.S., as some states and school districts refused to \nintegrate their school systems despite the holding that it was unconstitutional to do so. \n28.  In recognition of these challenges, Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nauthorized the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to enact measures \nthat would provide schools or other relevant government entities with technical assistance in \naddressing these challenges. 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2.  \n \n1 Who We Are: Our Mission, Southern Educ. Foundation, https://southerneducation.org/who-we-\nare/ (last visited Apr. 9, 2025).  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 9 of 39\n \n29.  Following Title IV’s passage, Desegregation Assistance Centers were established \nto provide technical assistance in the “preparation, adoption, and implementation of plans for \ndesegregation of public schools.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2; 34 C.F.R. § 270.1. When they were first \nestablished, the focus of the Centers was primarily on racially desegregating schools. By the early \n1990s, the goals of the Centers expanded with the implementation of the Improving America’s \nSchools Act of 1994.  With this expansion, the Centers shifted focus to assisting students to achieve \nacademic excellence regardless of race, sex, national origin, linguistic differences, cultural and \nsocial characteristics, economic circumstances, and disability.  \n30.  In  2016,  the  Department  conducted  a  formal  rulemaking  process,  renaming \n“Desegregation Assistance Centers” as “Equity Assistance Centers.”2 This name change did not \nchange the mission, but merely reflected the Centers’ expansion to support even more statutory \nmandates in public education. \n31.  In 2022, SEF applied for and received the award to operate the EAC for the southern \nregion (Region II). Region II is comprised of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, \nMississippi, North Carolina, South  Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and  the District of \nColumbia. Additionally,  Region  II  contains  130  of  the  132  remaining  open  federal  school \ndesegregation cases—precisely the type of cases Title IV was enacted to remedy through federally \nauthorized technical assistance and enforcement. Pursuing the original purpose of Title IV by \nsupporting the resolution of these 130 open federal court desegregation cases was the major factor \n \n2 Federal Register, Equity Assistance Centers (Formerly Desegregation Assistance Centers): A \nproposed  rule  by  the  Education  Department  on  3/24/2016,  available  at: \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/24/2016-06439/equity-assistance-centers-\nformerly-desegregation-assistance-centers (“Ultimately, the purpose of the regional centers is to \nensure access to educational opportunities for all students without regard to their race, sex, national \norigin, or religion.”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 10 of 39\n \nin SEF applying for the EAC grant. The current list of school districts under active desegregation \norders is attached as Exhibit A. The Department’s investment in desegregation technical assistance \nin Region II represents the greatest opportunity in recent years for targeted focus and resolution of \nthe  nation’s  federal  docket  of  open  school  desegregation  cases.   Additionally,  EAC-South \ncontinues to play a critical role in ensuring equitable access to education for all students by \nremaining true to its civil rights roots of “provid[ing] technical assistance and training at the \nrequest of school boards and other responsible governmental agencies in the preparation, adoption, \nand implementation of plans for the desegregation of public schools.”3  \n32.  The Secretary of Education is responsible for  competitively selecting eligible \ngrantees for the EACs across the United States. 42 U.S.C. 2000c(a); 34 C.F.R. § 270.4. The \ntechnical assistance provided by such projects must involve the desegregation of public schools in \nthe areas of race, sex, national origin, and religion. 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b); 42 U.S.C. 2000c-2; 34 \nC.F.R. §§ 270.4 and 270.7.  \nC. Notice and Comment Rulemaking Procedures Required for Agency Priorities. \n33.  Federal statutes and regulations, 20 U.S.C. 1234d and 34 C.F.R. Part 81, govern the \nprocedural requirements and substantive basis for the Department ending an EAC grant during a \nbudget period. See also 2 C.F.R. 200.340.    \n34.  The Secretary of Education (the “Secretary”) is required to publish agency priorities \n(“Priorities”) in the Federal Register, which must be used to select the more specific priorities for \nan award competition and must have gone through public comment, unless one of the following \nexceptions apply: \n \n3 Training and Advisory Servs. – Equity Assistance Centers, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nhttps://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-birth-grade-12/training-and-advisory-services--\nequity-assistance-centers (last visited Apr. 9, 2025).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 11 of 39\n \n(i)  The final annual priorities will be implemented only be inviting \napplications that meet the priorities; \n(ii)  The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities already \nestablished in the program’s regulations; \n(iii)  Publishing  proposed  annual  priorities  would  be  impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest; \n(iv)  The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to establish \nspecified priorities; or \n(v)  The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities specified \nin the program statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2). \n35.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific  priorities that are \nincluded in the application for each competitive federal grant program, such as the program for \nEACs, by publishing the priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal \nRegister. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1). \n36.  As a federal agency, the Department is unique in the statutory requirement it must \nfollow for setting agency Priorities for discretionary grants. While the APA  exempts grants from \nthe rulemaking process (see 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2)), the General Education Provisions Act (20 \nU.S.C. § 1232(d)) (“GEPA”) states that, for the Department, the grants exemption for rulemaking \nonly applies to regulations “(1) that govern the first grant competition under a new or substantially \nrevised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) where the Secretary determines \n[rulemaking] will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries of the program affected by \nsuch regulations.” \n37.  In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the above exceptions \nin 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) applies. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. \n3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 12 of 39\n \nD. Department of Education Priority Applicable to the Now-Terminated Equity Assistance \nCenters Grant. \n \n38.  After going through  the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published its Notice of Final Priority and Requirement for EACs in the Federal \nRegister on July 18, 2016. The final Priority states: “a track record of success or demonstrated \nexpertise in developing or providing technical assistance to increase socioeconomic diversity in \nschools or school districts as a means to further desegregation by race, sex, national origin, and \nreligion.” 81 F.R. 46817-46819. \n39.  Then, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published a Notice of Final Priority for discretionary grant programs in the Federal \nRegister on November 27, 2019. 84 F.R. 65300-65303. The Department published a Notice of \nFinal Priorities for all discretionary programs in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020, after \nfollowing a subsequent notice and comment rulemaking process. 85 F.R. 13640-13644. \n40.  Finally, the Department published a Notice of Final Priorities for the Secretary’s \nSupplemental Priorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on December \n10, 2021.  The final supplemental Priorities consisted of the following: Priority 1—Addressing the \nImpact of COVID-19 on Students, Educators, and Faculty; Priority 2—Promoting Equity in \nStudent Access to Educational Resources and Opportunities; Priority 3—Supporting a Diverse \nEducator Workforce  and  Professional  Growth  to Strengthen  Student  Learning;  Priority  4—\nMeeting Student Social, Emotion, and Academic Needs; Priority 5—Increasing Postsecondary \nEducation Access, Affordability, Completion, and Post-Enrollment Success; and Priority 6—\nStrengthening Cross-Agency Coordination and Community Engagement to Advance Systemic \nChange.  86 F.R. 70612-70641. \nE.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY2022 Equity Assistance Centers Grant. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 13 of 39\n \n41.  On February 15, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for \nthe FY2022 EAC competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. 87 F.R. 8564-8570. \n42.  The project period for the FY2022 competition, the maximum amount of time for \nwhich the grant can be awarded, was for a period of five years. 87 F.R. 8567. The EAC competition \nincluded the following Priority: Promoting Equity Through Diverse Partnerships.  87 F.R. 8566. \nF.  The Department of Education Award of a  Federal Grant to SEF for  the  Equity \nAssistance Center. \n \n43.  SEF applied for a grant to operate the EAC for Region II on May 16, 2022 (the \n“Application”). \n44.  As part of the Application, SEF outlined their five-year plan for the funding, \nindicating milestones they expected to reach annually. A core part of this five-year plan related to \nthe implementation of targeted and intensive technical assistance to public schools in the region \nwith a specific focus on the active school desegregation cases in federal courts. The targeted \ntechnical assistance would support educators in revising policies and practices to ensure high-\nquality educational opportunities for all students. The intensive technical assistance would aim to \nsustain such policies and practices to resolve persistent issues related to school desegregation. The \nmilestones for the technical assistance program through the EAC-South include: partner with \nfederal, state, and local officials and school boards to assess the needs of public schools in the \nregion; make resources accessible and available to public schools through their website and partner \norganizations; conduct webinars, modules, and simulations for educators across schools; host \nvirtual sessions on the challenges affecting the region; host local education agencies through \ntargeted technical assistance initiatives and provide virtual coaching sessions; and design and \nsupport programs that will enable the sustainability of programs and initiatives implemented \nthrough technical assistance to achieve unitary status for all students.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 14 of 39\n \n45.  In October 2022, the Department awarded SEF a five-year grant, totaling $8.6 \nmillion (S004D220011), to operate EAC-South. The grant is the sole source of funding for EAC-\nSouth. SEF received the initial Grant Award Notification (“GAN #1”), stating details for the initial \ngrant, budget periods and additional compliance provisions. GAN #1 is attached as Exhibit B.  \n46.  Since receiving the grant in 2022, SEF has spent considerable time and resources \ntowards assembling high-quality content and content providers necessary to address the unique \nissues of the southern region and its high volume of active school desegregation cases.  SEF has \nextended its historic brand and credibility toward forming a collaborative network to bring real \nfocus and resolution to the longstanding and disruptive legacy of racial segregation in public \neducation in the southern states.  \n47.  SEF, through EAC-South, has provided free services to public schools within its \nregion, including professional development of teachers to train them on, inter alia, improving \nstudent attendance and engagement; tailored support to schools, consulting on district goals and \nchallenges geared toward improving student equity; resources on retaining teachers and fostering \nan supportive environment for all students to succeed; and other services related to addressing \nelements of segregation in public education. \nG. The DEI-Focused Executive Orders and Directive from the Executive Branch. \n48.  Within hours of assuming the office of the President of the United States on January \n20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing” (“Executive Order 14151”). \n49.  The stated purpose and policy of Executive Order 14151 is to reverse the Biden \nAdministration’s  “forced  illegal  and  immoral  discrimination  programs,  going  by  the  name \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 15 of 39\n \n‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government.” \nExecutive Order 14151, § 1.  \n50.  Executive Order 14151 directed Trump Administration officials, consisting of the \nDirector of the OMB, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management, to “coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including \nillegal  DEI  and  ‘diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and  accessibility’  (DEIA)  mandates,  policies, \nprograms, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government.” Executive Order 14151, § 2(a).  \n51.  Executive Order 14151 further directed that each agency head “shall . . . terminate. \n. . all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, [and] ‘equity-related’ grants \nor contracts.” Executive Order 14151, § 2(b). Agency heads were asked to provide OMB with a \nlist of all federal grantees who received funding to provide or advance DEI. Executive Order \n14151, § 2(b)(ii). \n52.  The next day, on January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14173, \ntitled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” (“Executive Order \n14173”). This Executive Order repeats Executive Order 14151, declaring that diversity, equity, \ninclusion,  and accessibility programming “can violate the  civil-rights  laws of this Nation.” \nExecutive Order 14151, § 1. \n53.  In Executive Order 14173, signed on January 21, President Trump mandated “all \nexecutive departments and agencies [ ] to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, \nmandates, policies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent \norders, and requirements.” Executive Order 14173, § 2.  \n54.  Neither Executive Order (together the “DEI Executive Orders”)  defines what \nconstitutes  “DEI,”  “equity-related,”  “equity  action  plans,”  “equity  actions,  initiatives,  or \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 16 of 39\n \nprograms,” or “DEIA.” Nor do they provide any guidance as to what mandates, policies, programs, \nactivities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, grants, or contracts are \nconsidered unlawful diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives, “promoting DEI,” \n“illegal DEI,” or “illegal discrimination or preferences.” \n55.  On  January  27,  2025,  OMB  further  issued  a  memorandum,  ordering  federal \nagencies to pause federal funding and undertake a review of federal programs for compliance with \nthe Trump Administration’s policies and requirements (“OMB Directive”). This memorandum was \nquickly rescinded by OMB, two days later, with the White House Press Secretary clarifying that \nthe rescission of the memorandum does not affect the federal funding freeze.  \nH. The Department of Education’s Termination of SEF’s Federal Grant. \n56.  On February 13, 2025, less than one month after the release of the DEI Executive \nOrders, the Department announced the termination of grants to the four EACs for their alleged \nsupport of divisive training in DEI, among other things (the “February 13th Press Release”). The \nFebruary 13th Press Release is attached as Exhibit C to this Complaint.  \n57.  The same day, SEF received a letter from the Department stating that the grant SEF \nhad relied upon since 2022 was now allegedly inconsistent with the priorities of the Department \nand therefore terminated (the “Termination Letter”). The Termination Letter is attached as Exhibit \nD. Later that day, SEF received a Grant Award Notification (“GAN #2”), from the Department’s \nG6 grants administration system, noting the Center’s grant award was terminated, effective \nFebruary 13, 2025, and the subsequent grant years were removed from the award notice. GAN #2 \nis attached as Exhibit E.  \n58.  The Termination Letter stated that “[i]t is a priority of the Department to eliminate \ndiscrimination in all forms of education throughout the United States,” and that “this priority \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 17 of 39\n \nincludes ensuring that the Department’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives or any other initiatives \nthat unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another \nprotected characteristic.”  \n59.  The Termination Letter goes further to characterize the funding that supported the \nEAC-South as “promot[ing] or tak[ing] part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully \ndiscriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict with \nthe Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; . . . or that \notherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  \n60.  The Termination Letter also does not define diversity, equity, and inclusion or \ndescribe how the programs and initiatives are contrary to the Department’s priorities and policies \nunder the Trump Administration.  \n61.  In the Termination Letter, the agency did not state whether the EAC-South was \nfailing to comply substantially with the law. It did not provide a factual and legal basis for such an \nallegation. It did not provide an opportunity for a hearing to be held on a date at least 30 days after \nthe notification was sent. \n62.  The Termination Letter cites 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, “Continuation of a multiyear \nproject after the first budget period,” presumably as it relates to decisions not to make continuation \nawards. 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(f). But 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 applies where the agency is determining, \nafter the completion of the grantee’s first budget period, whether to grant funds for the subsequent \nbudget period. “The new budget period begins on the day after the previous budget period ends.” \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253(d). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 18 of 39\n \n63.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253 does not apply to termination of grants mid-budget period.  \n64.  EAC-South was in the middle of the FY2024 budget period when it received the \nTermination Letter. The Center received its first grant on September 26, 2022, for the FY22 budget \nperiod, ending on September 30, 2023. The Center received its second grant on July 20, 2023, for \nthe FY23 budget period, ending on September 30, 2024. Finally, the Center received its third grant \nfor the FY24 budget period, which ends on September 30, 2025. \n65.   On  February  17,  2025,  the  Department  followed  up  with  another  public \nannouncement on the termination of grants, explaining that the grants were allegedly the result of \nusing taxpayer funds to train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies, such as \n“Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity training” (the “February 17th Press Release,” and \ntogether with the February 13th Press Release, the “DOE Press Releases”)—as argued in the \nDepartment’s previous statement and the Termination Letter. The February 17th Press Release is \nattached as Exhibit F.   \n66.  While the GAN #2 and Termination Letter did not reference Executive Order 14151 \nas the reason for terminating the grant, the Department’s press releases create an undeniable causal \nconnection between the EAC grant termination and the Termination Provision in Executive Order \n14151 requiring the Department to terminate “equity-related” grants or contracts.  \nI.  General Education Provisions Act Enforcement Requirements Apply to The Equity \nAssistance Center Grants.   \n \n67.  The General Education Provisions Act (“GEPA”) enforcement provisions that \nallow for terminating a grant during a budget period, 20 U.S.C. § 1234d and for implementing \nregulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 81, apply to the EACs. The EACs are an “applicable program” for \nwhich the Secretary or the Department has administrative responsibility as provided by law. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1234i; 34 C.F.R. Part 81; 34 C.F.R. 270.6. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 19 of 39\n \n68.  The Department is required to use the Congressionally mandated GEPA procedures \nto end an EAC grant in the middle of a budget period because GEPA provides statutory remedies \nand procedural protections for grantees. The Department does not have the discretion to bypass \nGEPA procedures and substantive standards, nor can it apply Executive Branch-made procedures \nand standards from 2 C.F.R. Part 200, even if it prefers those procedures. \n69.  GEPA provides for withholding funds from a grantee when the grantee “is failing \nto comply substantially with any requirement of law applicable to such funds.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1234c(a); 34 C.F.R. 81.3. This is the substantive standard that must be met to end an EAC grant \nduring a budget period. \n70.  GEPA outlines the process required for the Secretary to withhold funds in such \ncircumstances. First, the Secretary must notify the grantee, in writing, of  (1) intent to withhold \npayments, (2) “the factual and legal basis for the Secretary’s belief that the [grantee] has failed to \ncomply substantially with a requirement of law,” and (3) “an opportunity for a hearing to be held \non a date at least 30 days after the notification has been sent to the [grantee].” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b); \n34 C.F.R. 81. \n71.  GEPA states that the Secretary may suspend payments to a grantee only “after the \n[grantee] has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause why future payments \n[. . .] should not be suspended.” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(d). \n72.  GEPA withholding and suspension procedures permit the Department to end an \nEAC grant in the middle of a budget period, i.e., to terminate the grant, as a remedy for the \ngrantee’s failure “to comply substantially with any requirement of law applicable to such funds.” \n20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 20 of 39\n \n73.  GEPA  does  not  allow  the  Department–as  it  has  done  here–to  bypass \nCongressionally mandated substantive and procedural requirements for “applicable programs” and \nend a grantee’s ability to draw down obligated funds in the middle of a budget period. Using grant \ntermination procedures outlined in 2 § C.F.R. 200.340 simply because the grant does not align with \nagency priorities is not the lawful method of grant termination here.  \n74.  In the alternative, even if GEPA does not apply (e.g., if a court finds that EACs are \ngrant programs excluded from the definition of “applicable programs” for the purposes of Part D \nof GEPA, 20 U.S.C. § 1234(i)), the Termination Letter fails to satisfy even the procedures in 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340. \nJ. The Adverse Impact of the Grant Termination on SEF. \n75.  Termination of SEF’s EAC grant has unlawfully deprived SEF of the sole source \nof funding for EAC-South, which, without Court intervention, has and will continue to cause \nimmediate and irreparable harm to EAC-South and those school districts and students that it serves.  \n76.  The loss of funding is economic harm so significant that it threatens the very \nexistence of EAC-South and its ability to provide critical assistance to schools and school districts. \n77.  The  loss  of  funding  will  not  only  end  SEF’s  ability  to  address  ongoing \ndesegregation  efforts  and  educational  issues  throughout  the  South  but  also  exacerbate  the \ninequities and lack of access to high-quality education and schools throughout the region and \ncountry. \n78.  At the time of this filing, there are 132 school districts under active desegregation \norders across the United States, and 130 of those schools and school districts fall in the EAC-\nSouth’s region. EAC-South helps those school districts on an as-requested basis. Since 2022, EAC-\nSouth has received requests for help from five districts under active desegregation orders and four \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 21 of 39\n \ndistricts with active civil rights complaints. As of February 13, 2025, EAC-South was actively \nhelping eight of them in response to their requests for assistance.  \n79.  At the time of this filing, EAC-South is providing critical technical assistance to \nFayette County Public Schools (“FCPS”), in Tennessee, which has remained under a federal \ndesegregation order since 1965. With EAC-South’s expert assistance, FCPS achieved partial \nunitary status, as determined by a federal court, and the district continues to make substantial \nprogress toward full compliance. EAC-South’s staff spent considerable time and effort to support \nFCPS through this process. Moreover, EAC-South is working with an Arkansas school district, \nunder a current Civil Rights Resolution, to establish equal access to gifted and advanced placement \nprograms for all students.  \n80.  However, as a result of the boilerplate Termination Letter and the Department’s \nrefusal to fund EAC-South, SEF is currently unable to operate EAC-South. It cannot provide vital \nassistance to schools and school districts seeking to resolve federal desegregation orders, therefore \nhindering SEF’s ability to fulfill its mission and the mission of EAC-South which flow directly \nfrom the anti-discrimination mandates of Brown and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \n81.  By halting EAC-South’s operations, the Department has denied school districts \naccess to critical, federally authorized technical assistance services that they have actively sought \nto address compliance with civil rights obligations. EAC-South is the only center of its kind in the \nregion. It is uniquely positioned to provide expert support at no cost to school districts—regardless \nof a district’s resources. The removal of this federally funded assistance imposes a significant \nfinancial burden on school districts, which could be highly cost prohibitive, thereby causing \nsubstantial and irreparable harm to their ability to serve all students equitably. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 22 of 39\n \n82.  The termination of the EAC-South grant will result in the loss of employment for \nthe dedicated staff and partners who ensure EAC-South run daily. The time and resources it will \ntake for EAC-South to recover from the loss of these experienced and specially trained staff \nmembers is uncertain. \n83.  SEF has suffered actual and immediate harm due to the February 2025 termination \nof funding, which forced SEF to shut down EAC-South in the middle of the program year. This \nsudden disruption caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to SEF, and to the school districts \nand students who rely on EAC-South for civil rights support. \n84.  SEF will suffer loss of goodwill and injury to reputation with the school districts \nthey service through EAC-South. School districts rely upon SEF and EAC-South for assistance \ninvolving compliance with desegregation orders. If school districts cannot rely on this assistance \nduring the middle of a grant period, they will be forced to look for services elsewhere.  \n85.  In addition to its operation of EAC-South, SEF also undertakes other operations in \nfurtherance of improving education for public school students across the Southern U.S. If school \ndistricts cannot rely on SEF and EAC-South to help them comply with desegregation orders, \nschool  districts  across  the  Southern  United  States  will  no  longer  view  SEF  as  a  reliable \norganization to further such goals.  \n86.  In short, this unexpected grant termination threatens to destroy the reliability and \ngoodwill that SEF and EAC-South have been developing in the southern public education system \nfor a century and a half. Although the economic realities of the grant termination also threaten \nEAC-South  and  SEF’s  existence,  the  existential  threats  go  beyond  monetary  harm—they \njeopardize their hard-earned reputation.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 23 of 39\n \n87.  Since the termination went into effect on February 13, 2025, SEF has not received \npending payments of $78,960.83 owed to it by the Department.  Additionally, as of February 13, \n2025, the Department had not paid SEF expenses for services rendered prior to the termination, \nwhich total $214,720.95.  \n88.  The termination of the grant will result in a $1,924,031.96 annual loss to SEF, \nincluding  total  outstanding  payments  of  $293,681.78  for  the  current  EAC-South  program. \nAdditionally, the termination of the grant will result in $3,371,108 overall loss, including the \nremaining two budget periods of a year each.  \n89.  The  Termination  Letter  provided  that  SEF  may  challenge  the  decision  by \nsubmitting information documenting their position in writing to the Department within thirty days \nof the termination. However, the letter failed to provide any guidance regarding the process or \ntimeline for the Department’s response, creating further uncertainty and depriving SEF of the \nability to meaningfully exercise any right to challenge the termination. \n90.  SEF timely submitted an appeal to the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of \nElementary and Secondary Education in line with procedures outlined in the Termination Letter. \nSEF’s appeal was submitted on March 11, 2025.  However, the termination of SEF’s EAC-South \nalready went into effect on February 13, 2025, causing immediate harm. Since that date, the \nDepartment has not provided any funding in connection with this grant to SEF. \n91.  Moreover, the Termination Letter does not provide for a timeframe by which the \nDepartment is obliged to make a determination regarding an appeal.  An indeterminate duration \nfor an appeal deprives SEF of critical funding needed to avoid further continued suspension of \nactivities undertaken by the EAC-South.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 24 of 39\n \n92.  On May 16, 2025, SEF withdrew its appeal to the Department by way of a letter \nsent electronically and through first-class mail.  \n93.  On May 14, 2025, the Department of Education remitted an electronic payment of \n$293,681.78 for outstanding expenses incurred by SEF on or before February 13, 2025. In spite of \nthis payment, the grant remains terminated by ED. In addition to the unlawful actions concerning \nSEF’s grant termination, the Department also added a special condition to the grant after it was \nterminated, requiring prior approval to draw down funds. This special condition is referred to as \n“route pay.” \n94.  Generally, unless a grantee poses a specific risk, they can draw down funds from \ntheir grant award based on allowable, allocable and reasonable costs approved in the budget \nwithout prior approval. \n95.  SEF is eligible for costs that were properly incurred before the termination date and \ncosts that would not have occurred if the grant was not terminated. As a grantee, SEF has 120 days \nto draw down funds after the termination date. 2 C.F.R. §§200.343, 200.472, 200.344(b).  \n96.  The imposition of a special condition on a grant, such as establishing additional \nprior approvals, can only be done if the grantee is determined to pose a risk.  \n97.  The rule states that before conditions are put in place, the agency has to notify the \ngrantee as to: (1) the nature of the additional requirements; (2) the reason why the additional \nrequirements are being imposed; (3) the nature of the action needed to remove the additional \nrequirement, if applicable; (4) the time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and (5) \nthe method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. 2 C.F.R. §208.  \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 25 of 39\n \n98.  Without notice, the Department put a blanket condition on the terminated grant to \nrequire prior approval for all drawdowns. This condition was not listed on the grant prior to the \nFebruary 13th termination.  \n99.  This new, unlawfully imposed condition has caused delays in SEF receiving its \ngrant funds and added subjectivity to already-incurred costs.  \n100.  Therefore, the placement of SEF grant on route pay was also unlawful.  \n101.  The APA waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity to permit judicial \nreview of agency action in limited circumstances. 5 U.S.C. § 705. Importantly, judicial review is \nlimited to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id.; accord \nAm. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. \nMd. Mar. 17, 2025) (same). Agency action is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action \nmust mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision-making process – it must not be of a \nmerely tentative or interlocutory nature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or \nobligations have been determined,’ of from which ‘legal consequences will flow,”’ Am. Ass’n of \nColls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, \n2025) (quoting Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 808 (2022)). \n102.  Absent Court intervention, and regardless of SEF’s appeal of the Department’s \ntermination of the grant, in contravention to Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Brown I and Brown II, SEF will be forced to permanently shut down \nEAC-South, causing greater harm to all parties. \n103.  SEF seeks emergency injunctive relief by directing the Department to return the \nGrant to the status quo ante and rescind the termination of its grant.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 26 of 39\n \nViolation of the APA—Unlawful Suspension of Grants (Arbitrary and Capricious Decision) \n(Against Defendants Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon) \n104.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n105.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise is in accordance with law” and \nto “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), \n(2)(A). \n106.  Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant constitutes final agency action under the \nAPA. \n107.  The Department failed to provide reasoned decision-making for terminating the \nEAC-South grant and SEF’s grant in its February 13th Press Release and Termination Letter. \n108.  The February 13th Press Release fails to explain how EAC-South grants “supported \ndivisive training in DEI, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity.”  \n109.  The February 13th Termination Letter failed to explain how the EAC-South grant \nconstituted a program or initiative promoting or taking part in DEI initiatives or defining “diversity, \nequity, and inclusion” and “illegal DEI.”  \n110.  The Department failed to account for the fact that EAC-South does not constitute \nDEI. The  Center  focuses  on  providing  technical  assistance  to  public  schools  in  the  South \nregardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in line with 42 U.S.C. § 2000c.  \n111.  Additionally, the Department terminated the grant because it “is inconsistent with, \nand no longer effectuates, Department priorities,” which is contrary to statute and regulation and \narbitrary and capricious.  \n112.  Moreover, the Termination Letter is nearly identical to the termination letters \nreceived by the EACs serving the other regions, further suggesting a lack of reasoned decision-\n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 27 of 39\n \nmaking in the Department’s termination of SEF’s grant. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. \nMcMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025) (“the Department’s \nuse of a template or boilerplate letter issued to  all Grant Recipients further strengthen[ed] \nPlaintiffs’ argument that the Department did not consider individual, or any, data or information.”). \n113.  In all, Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant was arbitrary and capricious.  \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the APA—Unlawful Suspension of Grants (Failure to Comply With Notice and \nComment Rulemaking Procedures) \n (Against All Defendants) \n114.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n115.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise is in accordance with law” and \nto “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.SC. § 706(1), (2)(A).  \n116.  Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant constitutes final agency action under the \nAPA. \n117.  Federal statutes and regulations, 20 U.S.C. 1234d and 34 C.F.R. Part 81, govern the \nprocedural requirements and substantive basis for the Department ending an EAC grant during a \nbudget period. See also 2 C.F.R. 200.340.    \n118.  The Secretary is required to publish Priorities in the Federal Register, which must \nbe used to select the more specific priorities for an award competition and must have gone through \npublic comment, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2); 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232(d). \n119.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific priorities that are \nincluded in the application for each competitive  federal grant program, such  as EACs, by \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 28 of 39\n \npublishing the priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal Register. 4 \nC.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1). \n120.  The Department is unique in the statutory requirement it must follow for setting \nagency Priorities for discretionary grants.  While the APA (5 U.S.C. § 553) exempts grants from \nthe rulemaking process, GEPA (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)) states that, for the Department, the grants \nexemption for rulemaking only applies to regulations (1) that govern the first grant competition \nunder a new or substantially revised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) \nwhere  the  Secretary  determines  rulemaking  will  cause  extreme  hardship  to  the  intended \nbeneficiaries of the program. \n121.  The Priorities for the grant programs administered by the Department must go \nthrough the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the aforementioned exceptions \napply. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, \nat *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025).  \n122.  None of the exceptions applies; the Department is required to go through notice and \ncomment rulemaking to change its Priorities. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, \n--- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \n123.  The Department did not go through notice and comment rulemaking to change its \nPriorities. As a result, and contrary to the Department’s officially stated reasons, the current \nPriorities remain Department Priorities, and the EAC-South grant remains consistent with the \nDepartment’s Priorities.  \n124.  Therefore, the Department’s termination of SEF’s grant funds is a violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and an unlawful suspension of grants. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the APA—Failure to Comport with Due Process Procedures  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 29 of 39\n \n(Against Defendants Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon) \n125.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n126.  GEPA applies to the EAC Program. See 20 U.S.C. § 1221(c)(1). The procedures \noutlined in that statute govern termination of EAC grants.  \n127.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253 does not apply to termination of grants mid-budget period and \nthus does not apply to the EAC-South grant termination. Rather, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 applies \nwhen making continuation grant decisions for future budget periods. See also Am. Ass’n of Colls. \nfor Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \n128.  20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a) requires that for an agency to withhold funds from a \ngrantee, the grantee must be “failing to comply substantially with any requirement of law \napplicable to such funds.” 20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a). \n129.  20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b) requires that, to withhold funds, the Secretary must notify \nthe grantee, in writing, of  (1) intent to withhold payments, (2) “the factual and legal basis for the \nSecretary’s belief that the [grantee] has failed to comply substantially with a requirement of law,” \nand (3) “an opportunity for a hearing to be held on a date at least 30 days after the notification \nhas been sent to the [grantee].” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b).  \n130.  Only after “the agency has given reasonable notice and an opportunity for the \ngrantee to demonstrate why future payments should not be suspended” can an agency withhold \nfunds. 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(d).  \n131.  GEPA does not allow the agency to terminate a grant because the grant does not \nalign with agency priorities.  \n132.  EAC-South has not failed to comply substantially with any part of the law \napplicable to the program. \n133.   The Department did not provide a factual or legal basis for its belief otherwise.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 30 of 39\n \n134.  The Department did not provide reasonable notice or an opportunity to be heard \nbefore withholding funds.  \n135.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to law in violation of the APA. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nU.S. Const., Fifth Amendment—Due Process (Vagueness)  \n \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n136.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n137.  A governmental enactment, including an executive order, is unconstitutionally \nvague under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution where “it fails to provide a \nperson of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it \nauthorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams, 553 \nU.S. 285, 304 (2008).  \n138.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 “fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited” and “is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” Id. \n139.  Executive Order 14151 fails to define key terms, such as “DEI,” “DEIA,” “equity,” \nor “equity-related,” and thus fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Constitution.  \n140.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 fails to distinguish between \n“Desegregation” targeted by Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and “DEI”, “DEIA,” “equity,” \nor “equity-related,” and thus fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Constitution. \n141.  The Termination  Letter  was  issued  pursuant  to  the Termination  Provision  of \nExecutive Order 14151 (§ 2(b)(i)). \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 31 of 39\n \n142.  SEF was subjected to the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 upon \nreceipt of the Termination Letter and the resulting termination of their EAC-South grant.  \n143.  SEF has been deprived of constitutionally guaranteed rights to due process in the \ntermination of the EAC-South grant.  \n144.  Executive Order 14151 and the Termination Letter “[fail] to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,” by failing to define “DEI” initiatives or \ndescribe the elements of EAC-South or any program receiving federal grants which it deems to \nviolate anti-discrimination laws.  \n145.  EAC-South is a Civil Rights Act-authorized school desegregation program. If its \nservices are deemed to be “unlawful discrimination the basis of race […] or other protected \ncharacteristic,” as described in the Termination Letter, no “person of ordinary intelligence” could \npossibly  understand  what  programs  are  not  prohibited  by  Executive  Order  14151  or  the \nTermination Letter. \n146.  Thus,  Executive  Order  14151  and  the  Termination  letter  are  effectively \nstandardless, leaving them vulnerable to discriminatory enforcement. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nViolation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – Failure to Comply with 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1 \n \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n147.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n148.  The Department seems to allege that the EAC-South grant violates Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. \n149.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 32 of 39\n \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” \n150.  The Termination Letter states that SEF’s grant “provides funding for programs \nthat promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic” and “that \nviolate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.” See Exhibit D. \n151.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 requires that federal grants the Department deems \nnoncompliant cannot be terminated “until the department or agency concerned has advised the \nappropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined \nthat compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.”  \n152.  Further, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 provides that “[i]n the case of any action \nterminating, or refusing to grant or continue, assistance because of failure to comply with a \nrequirement imposed pursuant to this section, the head of the Federal department or agency shall \nfile with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program \nor activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.” \nTerminations are not effective until thirty days after filing said report. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n153.  The Department did not advise SEF of the failure to comply with any requirement \nprior to its termination of the EAC-South grant.  \n154.  The Department did not determine that compliance could not be secured through \nvoluntary means. \n155.  To SEF’s knowledge, the Department did not file with the pertinent House and \nSenate committees a full written report of the circumstances and grounds for termination. \n156.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to law in violation of the APA. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 33 of 39\n \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires – Impoundment of Congressionally Appropriated Funds \n(Against All Defendants) \n157.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n158.  SEF has a non-statutory right of action to seek an injunction against unlawful \nofficial action that is ultra vires.  See Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1327-8 \n(1996).   \n159.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 \nU.S.  477,  n.2  (2010).   And  “the  President’s  actions  may  ...  be  reviewed  for \nconstitutionality.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992) (citations omitted).   \n160.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326-7 (2015).  The Supreme Court has thus allowed equitable relief against federal \nofficials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal statute. Larson v. Domestic & \nForeign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).  \n161.  The  President  and  the  Department  lack  the  authority  to  immediately  and \ncategorically terminate grant funding that has been appropriated by Congress, based on a policy \ndisagreement with aggregate spending levels set by Congress or to reorder spending priorities \ninconsistent with congressional budgetary determinations.   \n162.  Indeed, the Executive Branch itself has long recognized that “the suggestion that \nthe President has the constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated funds … is supported \nby neither reason nor precedent.”  Presidential Authority to Impound Funds Appropriated for \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 34 of 39\n \nAssistance to Federally Impacted Schools, 1 Supp. Op. O.L.C. 303, 309 (1969) (Rehnquist, \nA.A.G.).  \n163.  The United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ruled that \nsegregation in public education is unconstitutional. Brown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., \nKan., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), supplemented sub nom. Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Kan., 349 \nU.S. 294 (1955).  \n164.  The United States Congress enacted Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to carry \nout the  Brown v. Board of Education  ruling. The Department’s termination of SEF’s grant \nundermines the Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. \nBoard of Education. \n165.  The Take Care Clause forbids the President from refusing to faithfully execute the \nlaws of the United States, including spending laws.  See id. at 311.   \n166.  The Appropriations Clause states that “[n]o Money shall be drawn from the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.   \n167.  The Appropriations Clause was designed to “assure that public funds will be spent \naccording to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and \nnot according to the individual favor of Government agents.”  Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, \n496 U.S. 414, 428 (1990).  \n168.  The Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq., circumscribes the \nExecutive Branch’s authority to categorically terminate or modify obligated grant funding.  The \nImpoundment Control Act permits the Executive Branch to impound (i.e., decline to spend) federal \nfunds only under narrow circumstances.  2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684.    \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 35 of 39\n \n169.  The Impoundment Control Act does not permit the Executive Branch to defer \nappropriated funds based on policy disagreements with congressional priorities, id. § 684(b), nor \nto rescind funds without Congressional approval, id. § 683. \n170.  The President has not transmitted a special message to Congress requesting that the \nfunding associated with terminated grants be rescinded or deferred, and Congress has not rescinded \nany such appropriations.  The President is thus required by the Impoundment Control Act to \nexpend the appropriated funding. \n171.  Defendants have committed extreme error and have stepped so plainly beyond the \nbounds of their statutory authority, or acted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate \nintervention of an equity court.  \n172.  Defendants have patently misconstrued the APA such that they disregard a specific \nand unambiguous statutory directive. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution (Free Speech Clause)  \n(Against All Defendants) \n173.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n174.  “Discrimination  against  speech  because  of  its  message  is  presumed  to  be \nunconstitutional.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). \n“When the government targets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a \nsubject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.” Id.  \n175.  This restriction applies to government grantees. Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for \nOpen Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214-15 (2013). The government may not impose limitations \non grantees based on viewpoint. Id. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 36 of 39\n \n176.  The Termination Letter makes several overly broad and vague allegations regarding \nSEF’s grant: (1) that it “provides funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives \nor other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, or another protected characteristic,” (2) that the grant provides funding for programs that \notherwise “violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law,” or (3) that the grant \nprovides funding for programs “that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education.”  \n177.  The Termination Letter then states that SEF’s grant “is therefore inconsistent with, \nand no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” See Exhibit D.  \n178.  The Department’s termination of SEF’s grant constitutes viewpoint discrimination. \n179.  The  Executive  Order  14151  and  Termination  Letter  constitute  content-based \nregulations of speech because they discourage federal grantees from expressing support for, \nconducting academic research relating to, or for in any way speaking about initiatives that create \nequitable educational environments for all students, regardless of race.  \n180.  In particular, the failure to define prohibited “DEI initiatives” simultaneously with \nthe sudden punishment of grant termination chills the speech of federal grantees, including SEF \nand EAC-South, who engage in protected speech activities. \n181.  The Department failed to define “DEI initiatives” and failed to specify how SEF’s \ngrant funds programs that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or \nanother protected characteristic. \n182.  The Department’s actions target SEF’s speech and expressive conduct; specifically, \nEAC-South’s technical assistance, including its trainings and written work product that contain \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 37 of 39\n \nterms and references to creating equal access to educational opportunities, authorized by Title IV \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to carry out the Supreme Court decision in Brown. \n183.  The Department’s grant termination  targets and aims to suppress a particular \nviewpoint that promotes the value of providing equitable educational opportunities, rather than \ntargeting all viewpoints on the subject matter of educational equity equally, for example, by also \ntargeting programs that advocate against “diversity,” “equity,” or “inclusion.” \n184.  Defendants’ conduct with respect to SEF’s grant termination threatens to chill SEF \nand other grantees’ speech; it stigmatizes SEF and EAC-South based on their viewpoint by \ndenouncing  their  work  as  discriminatory  and  unlawful;  jeopardizing  their  trust  with  the \ncommunities they serve and damaging their reputation; and  it denies EAC-South access to \nfederally authorized funding based solely on its perceived association with a particular viewpoint. \n185.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to First Amendment protections under the \nConstitution. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court:  \na.  Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ termination of the EAC-South grant; \nb.  Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ action placing Plaintiff’s grant on route \npay;  \nc.  Order a temporary restraining order and preliminary and a permanent injunction \norder (a) enjoining the Defendants from enforcing the Termination Provision of Executive Order \n14151 and the February 13, 2025, termination letter sent to the Plaintiff from the Department; (b) \nordering such grant funding reinstated forthwith; and (c) ordering the Defendants to provide SEF \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 26     Filed 05/19/25     Page 38 of 39\n \nreimbursement  for  all  outstanding  expenses  and  otherwise  allowable  expenditures  incurred \nbetween the date of termination and this Court’s order; \nd.  Order the Defendants to rescind the February 13, 2025, Termination Letter and \nreinstate the federal grant for the EAC-South to the same extent and in the same manner as prior \nto the unlawful termination, as provided in the terms of the grant;  \ne.  Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees; and  \nf.

TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE \nUNITED  STATES  OF  AMERICA,  in  his \nofficial capacity;  \nc/o Attorney General of the United States of \nAmerica \nU.S. Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW \nWashington, DC 20530-0001 \n \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n1.  This  case  concerns  the  United  States  Department  of  Education’s  (“the \nDepartment”) abrupt and unlawful decision to terminate the Equity Assistance Center for the \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 2 of 38\n \nsouthern region (“EAC-South”), grant authorized under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n42 U.S.C. 2000c-2 (“Title IV”) and operated by the Southern Education Foundation, Inc. (“SEF”).  \n2.  For nearly a century, African American children were subjected to lawful racial \nsegregation in public education. The U.S. Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ruled \nthat racial segregation in public education was unconstitutional and ordered the desegregation of \nour nation’s systems of public education.  \n3.  In Title IV, Congress authorized the Department to provide “technical assistance in \nthe preparation, adoption and implementation plans for the desegregation of public schools.” 42 \nU.S.C.  §2000c-2.  To  advance  this  objective,  and  as  prescribed  by  federal  regulations,  the \nDepartment provides financial assistance to operate regional Equity Assistance Centers (“EACs”) \nand  awards  these  grants  to  eligible  entities,  including  nonprofit  organizations.  Every  year, \nCongress appropriates funding for training and technical assistance, specifically under Title IV of \nthe  Civil  Rights Act,  and  directs  the  Department  to  distribute  these  funds. After  Congress \nappropriates funds to the Department, and the Office of Management and Budget (the “OMB”) \napportions the funds for training and technical assistance programs. Every year, the Department \nobligates these grant funds to EAC grantees competitively selected for a full twelve-month budget \nperiod. Grantees are permitted to draw down (or spend) previously obligated funds during the \napproved budget period until September 30th of each budget year.  \n4.  However, on February 13, 2025, EAC-South was no longer permitted to spend \nfunds when the Department terminated, abruptly and without notice, EAC-South’s ability to draw \ndown funds previously obligated to SEF and issued a Grant Award Notification (GAN) terminating \nSEF’s grant and project. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 3 of 38\n \n5.  For over 150 years, SEF has advocated for equal education access for all. SEF \neducated formerly enslaved persons following the U.S. Civil War; it built schools, trained teachers, \nand developed education leaders in its efforts to dismantle segregated education. SEF continues its \nwork  by  developing  sound  practices  in  education  administration  and  supporting  leadership \ndevelopment in education. Since its 1867 founding, SEF has remained dedicated to advancing \neducation opportunity.  \n6.  SEF was actively involved in advancing the preparation and implementation of the \nSupreme Court’s landmark 1954 ruling in Brown v. Board of Education. In the years following the \nBrown decision and amid decades of ongoing civil rights advocacy, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \nwas signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson. Title IV was at the center of SEF’s work, \nwhich empowered federal efforts to desegregate public schools. SEF actively supported and \nadvocated for the enforcement of Title IV to help dismantle the nation’s unconstitutionally racially \nsegregated education system.    \n7.  As  part  of  SEF’s  strategy  to  address  to  the  continuing  harms  of  school \ndesegregation, SEF decided in 2020 to apply for the federal grant to operate the southern region’s \ndesegregation assistance center (or “technical assistance center”), renamed in 2016 as the Equity \nAssistance Center, or here, EAC-South.  In applying for the grant, SEF aimed to resolve remnants \nof segregated education, evidenced at least by the overwhelming number of open federal court \ndesegregation orders in the southern states. SEF intended for the EAC-South to lead the charge on \nremoving remaining impediments to equal access to quality education. \n8.  In 2022, the Department notified SEF that, based on its application, it was awarding \nSEF the grant to operate the EAC-South.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 4 of 38\n \n9.  Since receiving the grant, SEF has invested significant time and resources into \nbuilding a technical assistance center specifically designed to confront the high concentration of \nunresolved federal school desegregation cases in the southern region. Additionally, the Center \ndelivers research-based, targeted support to public schools still struggling with the lingering effects \nof segregation that continue to limit educational opportunity for students.  \n10.  President Donald J. Trump assumed office on January 20, 2025, and on that same \nday  signed  Executive  Order  14151,  titled  “Ending  Radical  and Wasteful  Government  DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing” (Executive Order 14151). Executive Order 14151 declared that the \nBiden Administration’s intention to support diversity, equity, and inclusion programming was \n“illegal and immoral discrimination.” Executive Order 14151 ordered federal agencies to terminate \n“all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, ‘equity-related’ grants or \ncontracts.”  \n11.  On January 21, 2025,  President Trump signed Executive Order 14173, titled \n“Ending  Illegal  Discrimination  and  Restoring  Merit-Based  Opportunity”  (“Executive  Order \n14173” and together with Executive Order 14151, signed on January 20, the “DEI Executive \nOrders”). Similar to Executive Order 14151, this order declared that programs supporting diversity, \nequity, and inclusion “can violate the civil-rights laws of this Nation,” and ordered executive \ndepartments and agencies to “terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, \npolicies, programs, activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and \nrequirements.”  \n12.  The Department issued a letter to SEF on February 13, 2025, abruptly terminating \nfunding for EAC-South (the “Termination Letter”). However, the letter failed to provide any \nexplanation of how EACs generally—or EAC-South specifically—allegedly promoted diversity, \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 5 of 38\n \nequity, and inclusion initiatives now considered inconsistent with the Department’s priorities. It \noffered no evidence that EAC-South engaged in any form of unlawful discrimination based on \nrace, color, religion, sex, national origin, or any other protected characteristic. Nor did it clarify \nhow EAC-South conflicted with Department policy or violated the very federal civil rights laws \nthat authorized and funded its creation. \n13.  The Department’s stated basis for terminating the grant and denying access to \nCongressionally appropriated funds previously obligated to SEF is contrary to the Constitution, \nstatute, and regulations. Moreover, the Department failed to follow applicable statutory due \nprocess procedures. The immediate termination constitutes an agency action that lacks reasoned \ndecision-making  and  is  arbitrary,  capricious,  and  not  in  accordance  with  law  under  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”). \n14.  The termination of EAC-South’s grant is unlawful, unjustified, and impedes the \nimportant work of assisting school districts to comply with federal civil rights law. Far from \nviolating federal civil rights law, EAC-South–the funding for which is authorized by Title IV–\nenforces the civil right law by helping schools comply with federally mandated desegregation and \nensure equal educational opportunity.  \n15.  This abrupt, unlawful termination doesn’t just harm SEF as the grantee; it harms \nthe public institutions that rely on EAC-South’s services to fulfill their legal obligations to provide \nequitable education for all students. Even more, it directly and immediately harms the students \nwho would otherwise benefit from EAC-South services.  \n16.  The Department’s unlawful termination will force the immediate cessation of \ncritical technical assistance and services, inflicting irreparable harm to SEF and EAC-South, as \nwell as the school districts and communities that rely on their support. The implementation and \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 6 of 38\n \nenforcement of the DEI Executive Orders as applied to SEF’s grant and the termination of SEF’s \ngrant must be enjoined to avoid immediate irreparable harm. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n17.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1361. \nThis Court has further remedial authority under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ \n2201(a) and 2202. \n18.  Venue is proper in this district because this action is against an officer, employee, \nand/or agency of the United States and a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to \nthe claim occurred in this judicial district. 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e).   \nPARTIES \n19.  Plaintiff  Southern  Education  Foundation,  Inc.  is  a  501(c)(3)  nonprofit \norganization that has been committed to advancing equitable education policies and practices for \npublic school students across the Southern United States for over 150 years. SEF is organized \nunder the laws of New York and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  \n20.  Defendant  United  States  Department  of  Education  is  a  federal  agency \nheadquartered  in Washington,  D.C.,  with  the  responsibility  of  providing  funding  to  critical \ninstitutions and nonprofits supporting education, like Plaintiff, in the United States.  \n21.  Defendant Linda McMahon is the United States Secretary of Education. She is \nsued in her official capacity.  \n22.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States. He is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 7 of 38\n \nFACTUAL AND LEGAL BACKGROUND \nA.  SEF’s 158-Year History Advancing Desegregation of Schools in the South. \n23.  In the final months of the U.S. Civil War, Congress established the Bureau of \nRefugees,  Freedmen  and Abandoned  Lands  (the  “Freedmen’s  Bureau”)  in  part  to  provide \neducation for persons freed from enslavement by the Union Army. Northern charities soon began \nshipping  books and paying  to  send teachers to  southern states to  support the work of the \nFreedman’s Bureau. When the war ended, philanthropies were formed to continue and scale up the \neffort of educating the masses of formerly enslaved persons and poor Whites in the southern states. \nIn 1867, two years after the end of the Civil War, financier George Peabody established the \nPeabody Education Fund to support the establishment of a permanent public education system in \nthe southern U.S. and to grow the number of qualified teachers in the region. Shortly afterwards, \nthe Slater Fund, the Jeanes Fund, the Rosenwald Fund and the Virginia Randolf Fund were \nestablished with the similar purpose of training teachers, providing books, and building schools \nfor the education of the formerly enslaved persons and poor Whites in the southern states. In 1937, \nthese foundations, with the exception of the Rosenwald Fund, were consolidated to form what is \nnow  the  Southern  Education  Foundation.  Since  1867,  SEF’s  mission  has  been  to  advance \neducational opportunity.1 \n24.  In addition to its role in the development of public education in the South, SEF \nprovided significant assistance to the effort to prove the unconstitutionality of the then-lawful \npractice of segregating public education on the basis of race. SEF provided convening and research \nsupport for Thurgood Marshall and the team of lawyers in preparation for the line of cases leading \n \n1 Who We Are: Our Mission, Southern Educ. Foundation, https://southerneducation.org/who-we-\nare/ (last visited Apr. 9, 2025).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 8 of 38\n \nup to Brown v. Board of Education. Notably, a year before the 1954 Brown decision, SEF housed \nresearchers who were compiling a national survey on the conditions of education for African \nAmerican students—work that informed and strengthened the case against segregation. \nB.  Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Establishment of Equity Assistance \nCenters. \n \n25.  The Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education did not alleviate all \nbarriers to desegregated public education in the U.S., as some states and school districts refused to \nintegrate their school systems despite the holding that it was unconstitutional to do so. \n26.  In recognition  of these challenges, Title IV of the Civil  Rights Act  of 1964 \nauthorized the Secretary of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to enact measures \nthat would provide schools or other relevant government entities with technical assistance in \naddressing these challenges. 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2.  \n27.  Following Title IV’s passage, Desegregation Assistance Centers were established \nto provide technical assistance in the “preparation, adoption, and implementation of plans for \ndesegregation of public schools.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2; 34 C.F.R. § 270.1. When they were first \nestablished, the focus of the Centers was primarily on racially desegregating schools. By the early \n1990s, the goals of the Centers expanded with the implementation of the Improving America’s \nSchools Act of 1994.  With this expansion, the Centers shifted focus to assisting students to achieve \nacademic excellence regardless of race, sex, national origin, linguistic differences, cultural and \nsocial characteristics, economic circumstances, and disability.  \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 9 of 38\n \n28.  In  2016,  the  Department  conducted  a  formal  rulemaking  process,  renaming \n“Desegregation Assistance Centers” as “Equity Assistance Centers.”2 This name change did not \nchange the mission, but merely reflected the Centers’ expansion to support even more statutory \nmandates in public education. \n29.  In 2022, SEF applied for and received the award to operate the EAC for the southern \nregion (Region II). Region II is comprised of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, \nMississippi,  North  Carolina,  South  Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia  and  the  District  of \nColumbia. Additionally,  Region  II  contains  130  of  the  132  remaining  open  federal  school \ndesegregation cases—precisely the type of cases Title IV was enacted to remedy through federally \nauthorized technical assistance and enforcement. Pursuing the original purpose of Title IV by \nsupporting the resolution of these 130 open federal court desegregation cases was the major factor \nin SEF applying for the EAC grant. The current list of school districts under active desegregation \norders is attached as Exhibit A. The Department’s investment in desegregation technical assistance \nin Region II represents the greatest opportunity in recent years for targeted focus and resolution of \nthe  nation’s  federal  docket  of  open  school  desegregation  cases.   Additionally,  EAC-South \ncontinues to play a critical role in ensuring equitable access to education for all students by \nremaining true to its civil rights roots of “provid[ing] technical assistance and training at the \n \n2 Federal Register, Equity Assistance Centers (Formerly Desegregation Assistance Centers): A \nproposed  rule  by  the  Education  Department  on  3/24/2016,  available  at: \nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/03/24/2016-06439/equity-assistance-centers-\nformerly-desegregation-assistance-centers (“Ultimately, the purpose of the regional centers is to \nensure access to educational opportunities for all students without regard to their race, sex, national \norigin, or religion.”). \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 10 of 38\n \nrequest of school boards and other responsible governmental agencies in the preparation, adoption, \nand implementation of plans for the desegregation of public schools.”3  \n30.  The Secretary of Education is responsible for  competitively selecting eligible \ngrantees for the EACs across the United States. 42 U.S.C. 2000c(a); 34 C.F.R. § 270.4. The \ntechnical assistance provided by such projects must involve the desegregation of public schools in \nthe areas of race, sex, national origin, and religion. 42 U.S.C. 2000c(b); 42 U.S.C. 2000c-2; 34 \nC.F.R. §§ 270.4 and 270.7.  \nC.  Notice and Comment Rulemaking Procedures Required for Agency Priorities. \n31.  Federal statutes and regulations, 20 U.S.C. 1234d and 34 C.F.R. Part 81, govern the \nprocedural requirements and substantive basis for the Department ending an EAC grant during a \nbudget period. See also 2 C.F.R. 200.340.    \n32.  The Secretary of Education (the “Secretary”) is required to publish agency priorities \n(“Priorities”) in the Federal Register, which must be used to select the more specific priorities for \nan award competition and must have gone through public comment, unless one of the following \nexceptions apply: \n(i)  The final annual priorities will be implemented only be inviting \napplications that meet the priorities; \n(ii)  The final annual priorities are chosen from a list of priorities already \nestablished in the program’s regulations; \n(iii)  Publishing  proposed  annual  priorities  would  be  impracticable, \nunnecessary, or contrary to the public interest; \n(iv)  The program statute requires or authorizes the Secretary to establish \nspecified priorities; or \n(v)  The annual priorities are chosen from allowable activities specified \nin the program statute. \n \n34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2). \n \n3 Training and Advisory Servs. – Equity Assistance Centers, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nhttps://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-birth-grade-12/training-and-advisory-services--\nequity-assistance-centers (last visited Apr. 9, 2025).  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 11 of 38\n \n33.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific  priorities that are \nincluded in the application for each competitive federal grant program, such as the program for \nEACs, by publishing the priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal \nRegister. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1). \n34.  As a federal agency, the Department is unique in the statutory requirement it must \nfollow for setting agency Priorities for discretionary grants. While the APA  exempts grants from \nthe rulemaking process (see 5 U.S.C. § 553(a)(2)), the General Education Provisions Act (20 \nU.S.C. § 1232(d)) (“GEPA”) states that, for the Department, the grants exemption for rulemaking \nonly applies to regulations “(1) that govern the first grant competition under a new or substantially \nrevised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) where the Secretary determines \n[rulemaking] will cause extreme hardship to the intended beneficiaries of the program affected by \nsuch regulations.” \n35.  In other words, the Priorities for grant programs administered by the Department \nmust go through the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the above exceptions \nin 20 U.S.C. § 1232(d) applies. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. \n3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \nD.  Department of Education Priority Applicable to the Now-Terminated Equity Assistance \nCenters Grant. \n \n36.  After going through the proper notice  and  comment  rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published its Notice of Final Priority and Requirement for EACs in the Federal \nRegister on July 18, 2016. The final Priority states: “a track record of success or demonstrated \nexpertise in developing or providing technical assistance to increase socioeconomic diversity in \nschools or school districts as a means to further desegregation by race, sex, national origin, and \nreligion.” 81 F.R. 46817-46819. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 12 of 38\n \n37.  Then, after going through the proper notice and comment rulemaking process, the \nDepartment published a Notice of Final Priority for discretionary grant programs in the Federal \nRegister on November 27, 2019. 84 F.R. 65300-65303. The Department published a Notice of \nFinal Priorities for all discretionary programs in the Federal Register on March 9, 2020, after \nfollowing a subsequent notice and comment rulemaking process. 85 F.R. 13640-13644. \n38.  Finally, the Department published a Notice of Final Priorities for the Secretary’s \nSupplemental Priorities for all discretionary grant programs in the Federal Register on December \n10, 2021.  The final supplemental Priorities consisted of the following: Priority 1—Addressing the \nImpact of COVID-19 on Students, Educators, and Faculty; Priority 2—Promoting Equity in \nStudent Access to Educational Resources and Opportunities; Priority 3—Supporting a Diverse \nEducator Workforce  and  Professional  Growth  to  Strengthen  Student  Learning;  Priority  4—\nMeeting Student Social, Emotion, and Academic Needs; Priority 5—Increasing Postsecondary \nEducation Access, Affordability, Completion, and Post-Enrollment Success; and Priority 6—\nStrengthening Cross-Agency Coordination and Community Engagement to Advance Systemic \nChange.  86 F.R. 70612-70641. \nE.  Notice Inviting Applications for FY2022 Equity Assistance Centers Grant. \n39.  On February 15, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications for \nthe FY2022 EAC competition, inviting applicants to apply for the grant funds. 87 F.R. 8564-8570. \n40.  The project period for the FY2022 competition, the maximum amount of time for \nwhich the grant can be awarded, was for a period of five years. 87 F.R. 8567. The EAC competition \nincluded the following Priority: Promoting Equity Through Diverse Partnerships.  87 F.R. 8566. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 13 of 38\n \nF.  The  Department  of  Education Award  of  a Federal  Grant  to  SEF  for  the  Equity \nAssistance Center. \n \n41.  SEF applied for a grant to operate the EAC for Region II on May 16, 2022 (the \n“Application”). \n42.  As part of the Application, SEF outlined their five-year plan for the funding, \nindicating milestones they expected to reach annually. A core part of this five-year plan related to \nthe implementation of targeted and intensive technical assistance to public schools in the region \nwith a specific focus on the active school desegregation cases in federal courts. The targeted \ntechnical assistance would support educators in revising policies and practices to ensure high-\nquality educational opportunities for all students. The intensive technical assistance would aim to \nsustain such policies and practices to resolve persistent issues related to school desegregation. The \nmilestones for the technical assistance program through the EAC-South include: partner with \nfederal, state, and local officials and school boards to assess the needs of public schools in the \nregion; make resources accessible and available to public schools through their website and partner \norganizations; conduct webinars, modules, and simulations for educators across schools; host \nvirtual sessions on the challenges affecting the region; host local education agencies through \ntargeted technical assistance initiatives and provide virtual coaching sessions; and design and \nsupport programs that will enable the sustainability of programs and initiatives implemented \nthrough technical assistance to achieve unitary status for all students.  \n43.  In October 2022, the Department awarded SEF a five-year grant, totaling $8.6 \nmillion (S004D220011), to operate EAC-South. The grant is the sole source of funding for EAC-\nSouth. SEF received the initial Grant Award Notification (“GAN #1”), stating details for the initial \ngrant, budget periods and additional compliance provisions. GAN #1 is attached as Exhibit B.  \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 14 of 38\n \n44.  Since receiving the grant in 2022, SEF has spent considerable time and resources \ntowards assembling high-quality content and content providers necessary to address the unique \nissues of the southern region and its high volume of active school desegregation cases.  SEF has \nextended its historic brand and credibility toward forming a collaborative network to bring real \nfocus and resolution to the longstanding and disruptive legacy of racial segregation in public \neducation in the southern states.  \n45.  SEF, through EAC-South, has provided free services to public schools within its \nregion, including professional development of teachers to train them on, inter alia, improving \nstudent attendance and engagement; tailored support to schools, consulting on district goals and \nchallenges geared toward improving student equity; resources on retaining teachers and fostering \nan supportive environment for all students to succeed; and other services related to addressing \nelements of segregation in public education. \nG. The DEI-Focused Executive Orders and Directive from the Executive Branch. \n46.  Within hours of assuming the office of the President of the United States on January \n20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing” (“Executive Order 14151”). \n47.  The stated purpose and policy of Executive Order 14151 is to reverse the Biden \nAdministration’s  “forced  illegal  and  immoral  discrimination  programs,  going  by  the  name \n‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI), into virtually all aspects of the Federal Government.” \nExecutive Order 14151, § 1.  \n48.  Executive Order 14151 directed Trump Administration officials, consisting of the \nDirector of the OMB, the Attorney General of the United States, and the Director of the Office of \nPersonnel Management, to “coordinate the termination of all discriminatory programs, including \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 15 of 38\n \nillegal  DEI  and  ‘diversity,  equity,  inclusion,  and  accessibility’  (DEIA)  mandates,  policies, \nprograms, preferences, and activities in the Federal Government.” Executive Order 14151, § 2(a).  \n49.  Executive Order 14151 further directed that each agency head “shall . . . terminate. \n. . all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or programs, [and] ‘equity-related’ grants \nor contracts.” Executive Order 14151, § 2(b). Agency heads were asked to provide OMB with a \nlist of all federal grantees who received funding to provide or advance DEI. Executive Order \n14151, § 2(b)(ii). \n50.  The next day, on January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14173, \ntitled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity” (“Executive Order \n14173”). This Executive Order repeats Executive Order 14151, declaring that diversity, equity, \ninclusion,  and  accessibility  programming  “can  violate  the  civil-rights  laws  of  this  Nation.” \nExecutive Order 14151, § 1. \n51.  In Executive Order 14173, signed on January 21, President Trump mandated “all \nexecutive departments and agencies [ ] to terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, \nmandates, policies, programs,  activities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions,  consent \norders, and requirements.” Executive Order 14173, § 2.  \n52.  Neither Executive Order (together the “DEI Executive Orders”) defines what \nconstitutes  “DEI,”  “equity-related,”  “equity  action  plans,”  “equity  actions,  initiatives,  or \nprograms,” or “DEIA.” Nor do they provide any guidance as to what mandates, policies, programs, \nactivities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, grants, or contracts are \nconsidered unlawful diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility initiatives, “promoting DEI,” \n“illegal DEI,” or “illegal discrimination or preferences.” \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 16 of 38\n \n53.  On  January  27,  2025,  OMB  further  issued  a  memorandum,  ordering  federal \nagencies to pause federal funding and undertake a review of federal programs for compliance with \nthe Trump Administration’s policies and requirements (“OMB Directive”). This memorandum was \nquickly rescinded by OMB, two days later, with the White House Press Secretary clarifying that \nthe rescission of the memorandum does not affect the federal funding freeze.  \nH. The Department of Education’s Termination of SEF’s Federal Grant. \n54.  On February 13, 2025, less than one month after the release of the DEI Executive \nOrders, the Department announced the termination of grants to the four EACs for their alleged \nsupport of divisive training in DEI, among other things (the “February 13th Press Release”). The \nFebruary 13th Press Release is attached as Exhibit C to this Complaint.  \n55.  The same day, SEF received a letter from the Department stating that the grant SEF \nhad relied upon since 2022 was now allegedly inconsistent with the priorities of the Department \nand therefore terminated (the “Termination Letter”). The Termination Letter is attached as Exhibit \nD. Later that day, SEF received a Grant Award Notification (“GAN #2”), from the Department’s \nG6 grants administration system, noting the Center’s grant award was terminated, effective \nFebruary 13, 2025, and the subsequent grant years were removed from the award notice. GAN #2 \nis attached as Exhibit E.  \n56.  The Termination Letter stated that “[i]t is a priority of the Department to eliminate \ndiscrimination in all forms of education throughout the United States,” and that “this priority \nincludes ensuring that the Department’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) initiatives or any other initiatives \nthat unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another \nprotected characteristic.”  \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 17 of 38\n \n57.  The Termination Letter goes further to characterize the funding that supported the \nEAC-South as “promot[ing] or tak[ing] part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully \ndiscriminate on the basis of race, color, religion,  sex, national  origin, or another protected \ncharacteristic; that violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict with \nthe Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and excellence in education; . . . or that \notherwise fail to serve the best interests of the United States.”  \n58.  The Termination Letter also does not define diversity, equity, and inclusion or \ndescribe how the programs and initiatives are contrary to the Department’s priorities and policies \nunder the Trump Administration.  \n59.  In the Termination Letter, the agency did not state whether the EAC-South was \nfailing to comply substantially with the law. It did not provide a factual and legal basis for such an \nallegation. It did not provide an opportunity for a hearing to be held on a date at least 30 days after \nthe notification was sent. \n60.  The Termination Letter cites 34 C.F.R. § 75.253, “Continuation of a multiyear \nproject after the first budget period,” presumably as it relates to decisions not to make continuation \nawards. 34 C.F.R. § 75.253(f). But 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 applies where the agency is determining, \nafter the completion of the grantee’s first budget period, whether to grant funds for the subsequent \nbudget period. “The new budget period begins on the day after the previous budget period ends.” \n34 C.F.R. § 75.253(d). \n61.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253 does not apply to termination of grants mid-budget period.  \n62.  EAC-South was in the middle of the FY2024 budget period when it received the \nTermination Letter. The Center received its first grant on September 26, 2022, for the FY22 budget \nperiod, ending on September 30, 2023. The Center received its second grant on July 20, 2023, for \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 18 of 38\n \nthe FY23 budget period, ending on September 30, 2024. Finally, the Center received its third grant \nfor the FY24 budget period, which ends on September 30, 2025. \n63.   On  February  17,  2025,  the  Department  followed  up  with  another  public \nannouncement on the termination of grants, explaining that the grants were allegedly the result of \nusing taxpayer funds to train teachers and education agencies on divisive ideologies, such as \n“Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” and “equity training” (the “February 17th Press Release,” and \ntogether with the February 13th Press Release, the “DOE Press Releases”)—as argued in the \nDepartment’s previous statement and the Termination Letter. The February 17th Press Release is \nattached as Exhibit F.   \n64.  While the GAN #2 and Termination Letter did not reference Executive Order 14151 \nas the reason for terminating the grant, the Department’s press releases create an undeniable causal \nconnection between the EAC grant termination and the Termination Provision in Executive Order \n14151 requiring the Department to terminate “equity-related” grants or contracts.  \nI.  General Education Provisions Act Enforcement Requirements Apply to The Equity \nAssistance Center Grants.   \n \n65.  The General Education Provisions Act (“GEPA”) enforcement provisions that \nallow for terminating a grant during a budget period, 20 U.S.C. § 1234d and for implementing \nregulations at 34 C.F.R. Part 81, apply to the EACs. The EACs are an “applicable program” for \nwhich the Secretary or the Department has administrative responsibility as provided by law. 20 \nU.S.C. § 1234i; 34 C.F.R. Part 81; 34 C.F.R. 270.6. \n66.  The Department is required to use the Congressionally mandated GEPA procedures \nto end an EAC grant in the middle of a budget period because GEPA provides statutory remedies \nand procedural protections for grantees. The Department does not have the discretion to bypass \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 19 of 38\n \nGEPA procedures and substantive standards, nor can it apply Executive Branch-made procedures \nand standards from 2 C.F.R. Part 200, even if it prefers those procedures. \n67.  GEPA provides for withholding funds from a grantee when the grantee “is failing \nto comply substantially with any requirement of law applicable to such funds.” 20 U.S.C. § \n1234c(a); 34 C.F.R. 81.3. This is the substantive standard that must be met to end an EAC grant \nduring a budget period. \n68.  GEPA outlines the process required for the Secretary to withhold funds in such \ncircumstances. First, the Secretary must notify the grantee, in writing, of  (1) intent to withhold \npayments, (2) “the factual and legal basis for the Secretary’s belief that the [grantee] has failed to \ncomply substantially with a requirement of law,” and (3) “an opportunity for a hearing to be held \non a date at least 30 days after the notification has been sent to the [grantee].” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b); \n34 C.F.R. 81. \n69.  GEPA states that the Secretary may suspend payments to a grantee only “after the \n[grantee] has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity to show cause why future payments \n[. . .] should not be suspended.” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(d). \n70.  GEPA withholding and suspension procedures permit the Department to end an \nEAC grant in the middle of a budget period, i.e., to terminate the grant, as a remedy for the \ngrantee’s failure “to comply substantially with any requirement of law applicable to such funds.” \n20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a). \n71.  GEPA  does  not  allow  the  Department–as  it  has  done  here–to  bypass \nCongressionally mandated substantive and procedural requirements for “applicable programs” and \nend a grantee’s ability to draw down obligated funds in the middle of a budget period. Using grant \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 20 of 38\n \ntermination procedures outlined in 2 § C.F.R. 200.340 simply because the grant does not align with \nagency priorities is not the lawful method of grant termination here.  \n72.  In the alternative, even if GEPA does not apply (e.g., if a court finds that EACs are \ngrant programs excluded from the definition of “applicable programs” for the purposes of Part D \nof GEPA, 20 U.S.C. § 1234(i)), the Termination Letter fails to satisfy even the procedures in 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340. \nJ. The Adverse Impact of the Grant Termination on SEF. \n73.  Termination of SEF’s EAC grant has unlawfully deprived SEF of the sole source \nof funding for EAC-South, which, without Court intervention, has and will continue to cause \nimmediate and irreparable harm to EAC-South and those school districts and students that it serves.  \n74.  The loss of funding is economic harm so significant that it threatens the very \nexistence of EAC-South and its ability to provide critical assistance to schools and school districts. \n75.  The  loss  of  funding  will  not  only  end  SEF’s  ability  to  address  ongoing \ndesegregation  efforts  and  educational  issues  throughout  the  South  but  also  exacerbate  the \ninequities and lack of access to high-quality education and schools throughout the region and \ncountry. \n76.  At the time of this filing, there are 132 school districts under active desegregation \norders across the United States, and 130 of those schools and school districts fall in the EAC-\nSouth’s region. EAC-South helps those school districts on an as-requested basis. Since 2022, EAC-\nSouth has received requests for help from five districts under active desegregation orders and four \ndistricts with active civil rights complaints. As of February 13, 2025, EAC-South was actively \nhelping eight of them in response to their requests for assistance.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 21 of 38\n \n77.  At the time of this filing, EAC-South is providing critical technical assistance to \nFayette County Public Schools (“FCPS”), in Tennessee, which has remained under a federal \ndesegregation order since 1965. With EAC-South’s expert assistance, FCPS achieved partial \nunitary status, as determined by a federal court, and the district continues to make substantial \nprogress toward full compliance. EAC-South’s staff spent considerable time and effort to support \nFCPS through this process. Moreover, EAC-South is working with an Arkansas school district, \nunder a current Civil Rights Resolution, to establish equal access to gifted and advanced placement \nprograms for all students.  \n78.  However, as a result of the boilerplate Termination Letter and the Department’s \nrefusal to fund EAC-South, SEF is currently unable to operate EAC-South. It cannot provide vital \nassistance to schools and school districts seeking to resolve federal desegregation orders, therefore \nhindering SEF’s ability to fulfill its mission and the mission of EAC-South which flow directly \nfrom the anti-discrimination mandates of Brown and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \n79.  By halting EAC-South’s operations, the Department has denied school districts \naccess to critical, federally authorized technical assistance services that they have actively sought \nto address compliance with civil rights obligations. EAC-South is the only center of its kind in the \nregion. It is uniquely positioned to provide expert support at no cost to school districts—regardless \nof a district’s resources. The removal of this federally funded assistance imposes a significant \nfinancial burden on school districts, which could be highly cost prohibitive, thereby causing \nsubstantial and irreparable harm to their ability to serve all students equitably. \n80.  The termination of the EAC-South grant will result in the loss of employment for \nthe dedicated staff and partners who ensure EAC-South run daily. The time and resources it will \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 22 of 38\n \ntake for EAC-South to recover from the loss of these experienced and specially trained staff \nmembers is uncertain. \n81.  SEF has suffered actual and immediate harm due to the February 2025 termination \nof funding, which forced SEF to shut down EAC-South in the middle of the program year. This \nsudden disruption caused and continues to cause irreparable harm to SEF, and to the school districts \nand students who rely on EAC-South for civil rights support. \n82.  SEF will suffer loss of goodwill and injury to reputation with the school districts \nthey service through EAC-South. School districts rely upon SEF and EAC-South for assistance \ninvolving compliance with desegregation orders. If school districts cannot rely on this assistance \nduring the middle of a grant period, they will be forced to look for services elsewhere.  \n83.  In addition to its operation of EAC-South, SEF also undertakes other operations in \nfurtherance of improving education for public school students across the Southern U.S. If school \ndistricts cannot rely on SEF and EAC-South to help them comply with desegregation orders, \nschool  districts  across  the  Southern  United  States  will  no  longer  view  SEF  as  a  reliable \norganization to further such goals.  \n84.  In short, this unexpected grant termination threatens to destroy the reliability and \ngoodwill that SEF and EAC-South have been developing in the southern public education system \nfor a century and a half. Although the economic realities of the grant termination also threaten \nEAC-South  and  SEF’s  existence,  the  existential  threats  go  beyond  monetary  harm—they \njeopardize their hard-earned reputation.  \n85.  Since the termination went into effect on February 13, 2025, SEF has not received \npending payments of $78,960.83 owed to it by the Department.  Additionally, as of February 13, \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 23 of 38\n \n2025, the Department had not paid SEF expenses for services rendered prior to the termination, \nwhich total $214,720.95.  \n86.  The termination of the grant will result in a $1,924,031.96 annual loss to SEF, \nincluding  total  outstanding  payments  of  $293,681.78  for  the  current  EAC-South  program. \nAdditionally, the termination of the grant will result in $3,371,108 overall loss, including the \nremaining two budget periods of a year each.  \n87.  The  Termination  Letter  provided  that  SEF  may  challenge  the  decision  by \nsubmitting information documenting their position in writing to the Department within thirty days \nof the termination. However, the letter failed to provide any guidance regarding the process or \ntimeline for the Department’s response, creating further uncertainty and depriving SEF of the \nability to meaningfully exercise any right to challenge the termination. \n88.  SEF timely submitted an appeal to the Acting Assistant Secretary for the Office of \nElementary and Secondary Education in line with procedures outlined in the Termination Letter. \nSEF’s appeal was submitted on March 11, 2025.  However, the termination of SEF’s EAC-South \nalready went into effect on February 13, 2025, causing immediate harm. Since that date, the \nDepartment has not provided any funding in connection with this grant to SEF. \n89.  Moreover, the Termination Letter does not provide for a timeframe by which the \nDepartment is obliged to make a determination regarding an appeal.  An indeterminate duration \nfor an appeal deprives SEF of critical funding needed to avoid further continued suspension of \nactivities undertaken by the EAC-South.  \n90.  In  addition  to  the  unlawful  actions  concerning  SEF’s  grant  termination,  the \nDepartment also added a special condition to the grant after it was terminated, requiring prior \napproval to draw down funds. This special condition is referred to as “route pay.” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 24 of 38\n \n91.  Generally, unless a grantee poses a specific risk, they can draw down funds from \ntheir grant award based on allowable, allocable and reasonable costs approved in the budget \nwithout prior approval. \n92.  SEF is eligible for costs that were properly incurred before the termination date and \ncosts that would not have occurred if the grant was not terminated. As a grantee, SEF has 120 days \nto draw down funds after the termination date. 2 C.F.R. §§200.343, 200.472, 200.344(b).  \n93.  The imposition of a special condition on a grant, such as establishing additional \nprior approvals, can only be done if the grantee is determined to pose a risk.  \n94.  The rule states that before conditions are put in place, the agency has to notify the \ngrantee as to: (1) the nature of the additional requirements; (2) the reason why the additional \nrequirements are being imposed; (3) the nature of the action needed to remove the additional \nrequirement, if applicable; (4) the time allowed for completing the actions if applicable; and (5) \nthe method for requesting reconsideration of the additional requirements imposed. 2 C.F.R. §208.  \n95.  Without notice, the Department put a blanket condition on the terminated grant to \nrequire prior approval for all drawdowns. This condition was not listed on the grant prior to the \nFebruary 13th termination.  \n96.  This new, unlawfully imposed condition has caused delays in SEF receiving its \ngrant funds and added subjectivity to already-incurred costs.  \n97.  Therefore, the placement of SEF grant on route pay was also unlawful.  \n98.  The APA waives the federal government’s sovereign immunity to permit judicial \nreview of agency action in limited circumstances. 5 U.S.C. § 705. Importantly, judicial review is \nlimited to “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court.” Id.; accord \nAm. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 25 of 38\n \nMd. Mar. 17, 2025) (same). Agency action is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action \nmust mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decision-making process – it must not be of a \nmerely tentative or interlocutory nature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or \nobligations have been determined,’ of from which ‘legal consequences will flow,”’ Am. Ass’n of \nColls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, \n2025) (quoting Biden v. Texas, 597 U.S. 785, 808 (2022)). \n99.  Absent Court intervention, and regardless of SEF’s appeal of the Department’s \ntermination of the grant, in contravention to Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the \nSupreme Court's ruling in Brown I and Brown II, SEF will be forced to permanently shut down \nEAC-South, causing greater harm to all parties. \n100.  SEF seeks emergency injunctive relief by directing the Department to return the \nGrant to the status quo ante and rescind the termination of its grant.  \nCAUSES OF ACTION \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the APA—Unlawful Suspension of Grants (Arbitrary and Capricious Decision) \n(Against Defendants Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon) \n101.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n102.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise is in accordance with law” and \nto “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(1), \n(2)(A). \n103.  Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant constitutes final agency action under the \nAPA. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 26 of 38\n \n104.  The Department failed to provide reasoned decision-making for terminating the \nEAC-South grant and SEF’s grant in its February 13th Press Release and Termination Letter. \n105.  The February 13th Press Release fails to explain how EAC-South grants “supported \ndivisive training in DEI, Critical Race Theory, and gender identity.”  \n106.  The February 13th Termination Letter failed to explain how the EAC-South grant \nconstituted a program or initiative promoting or taking part in DEI initiatives or defining “diversity, \nequity, and inclusion” and “illegal DEI.”  \n107.  The Department failed to account for the fact that EAC-South does not constitute \nDEI. The  Center  focuses  on  providing  technical  assistance  to  public  schools  in  the  South \nregardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in line with 42 U.S.C. § 2000c.  \n108.  Additionally, the Department terminated the grant because it “is inconsistent with, \nand no longer effectuates, Department priorities,” which is contrary to statute and regulation and \narbitrary and capricious.  \n109.  Moreover, the Termination Letter is nearly identical to the termination letters \nreceived by the EACs serving the other regions, further suggesting a lack of reasoned decision-\nmaking in the Department’s termination of SEF’s grant. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. \nMcMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025) (“the Department’s \nuse of a template or boilerplate letter issued to all Grant  Recipients  further strengthen[ed] \nPlaintiffs’ argument that the Department did not consider individual, or any, data or information.”). \n110.  In all, Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant was arbitrary and capricious.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 27 of 38\n \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the APA—Unlawful Suspension of Grants (Failure to Comply With Notice and \nComment Rulemaking Procedures) \n (Against All Defendants) \n111.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference.  \n112.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise is in accordance with law” and \nto “compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.” 5 U.SC. § 706(1), (2)(A).  \n113.  Defendants’ termination of SEF’s grant constitutes final agency action under the \nAPA. \n114.  Federal statutes and regulations, 20 U.S.C. 1234d and 34 C.F.R. Part 81, govern the \nprocedural requirements and substantive basis for the Department ending an EAC grant during a \nbudget period. See also 2 C.F.R. 200.340.    \n115.  The Secretary is required to publish Priorities in the Federal Register, which must \nbe used to select the more specific priorities for an award competition and must have gone through \npublic comment, subject to certain exceptions not applicable here. 34 C.F.R. § 75.105(b)(2); 20 \nU.S.C. § 1232(d). \n116.  The Secretary is likewise required to establish the specific priorities that are \nincluded  in  the  application  for  each  competitive  federal  grant  program,  such  as  EACs,  by \npublishing the priorities in the Notice Inviting Applications for the grant in the Federal Register. 4 \nC.F.R. § 75.105(b)(1). \n117.  The Department is unique in the statutory requirement it must follow for setting \nagency Priorities for discretionary grants.  While the APA (5 U.S.C. § 553) exempts grants from \nthe rulemaking process, GEPA (20 U.S.C. § 1232(d)) states that, for the Department, the grants \nexemption for rulemaking only applies to regulations (1) that govern the first grant competition \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 28 of 38\n \nunder a new or substantially revised program authority as determined by the Secretary; or (2) \nwhere  the  Secretary  determines  rulemaking  will  cause  extreme  hardship  to  the  intended \nbeneficiaries of the program. \n118.  The Priorities for the grant programs administered by the Department must go \nthrough the notice and comment rulemaking process, unless one of the aforementioned exceptions \napply. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917, \nat *21 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025).  \n119.  None of the exceptions applies; the Department is required to go through notice and \ncomment rulemaking to change its Priorities. See Am. Ass’n of Colls. for Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, \n--- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \n120.  The Department did not go through notice and comment rulemaking to change its \nPriorities. As a result, and contrary to the Department’s officially stated reasons, the current \nPriorities remain Department Priorities, and the EAC-South grant remains consistent with the \nDepartment’s Priorities.  \n121.  Therefore, the Department’s termination of SEF’s grant funds is a violation of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and an unlawful suspension of grants. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the APA—Failure to Comport with Due Process Procedures  \n(Against Defendants Department of Education, Secretary Linda McMahon) \n122.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n123.  GEPA applies to the EAC Program. See 20 U.S.C. § 1221(c)(1). The procedures \noutlined in that statute govern termination of EAC grants.  \n124.  34 C.F.R. § 75.253 does not apply to termination of grants mid-budget period and \nthus does not apply to the EAC-South grant termination. Rather, 34 C.F.R. § 75.253 applies \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 29 of 38\n \nwhen making continuation grant decisions for future budget periods. See also Am. Ass’n of Colls. \nfor Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2025 WL 833917 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025). \n125.  20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a) requires that for an agency to withhold funds from a \ngrantee, the grantee must be “failing to comply substantially with any requirement of law \napplicable to such funds.” 20 U.S.C. § 1234c(a). \n126.  20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b) requires that, to withhold funds, the Secretary must notify \nthe grantee, in writing, of  (1) intent to withhold payments, (2) “the factual and legal basis for the \nSecretary’s belief that the [grantee] has failed to comply substantially with a requirement of law,” \nand (3) “an opportunity for a hearing to be held on a date at least 30 days after the notification \nhas been sent to the [grantee].” 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(b).  \n127.  Only after “the agency has given reasonable notice and an opportunity for the \ngrantee to demonstrate why future payments should not be suspended” can an agency withhold \nfunds. 20 U.S.C. § 1234d(d).  \n128.  GEPA does not allow the agency to terminate a grant because the grant does not \nalign with agency priorities.  \n129.  EAC-South has not failed to comply substantially with any part of the law \napplicable to the program. \n130.   The Department did not provide a factual or legal basis for its belief otherwise.  \n131.  The Department did not provide reasonable notice or an opportunity to be heard \nbefore withholding funds.  \n132.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to law in violation of the APA. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 30 of 38\n \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nU.S. Const., Fifth Amendment—Due Process (Vagueness)  \n \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n133.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n134.  A governmental enactment, including an executive order, is unconstitutionally \nvague under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution where “it fails to provide a \nperson of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standardless that it \nauthorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” United States v. Williams, 553 \nU.S. 285, 304 (2008).  \n135.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 “fails to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited” and “is so standardless that it authorizes or \nencourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.” Id. \n136.  Executive Order 14151 fails to define key terms, such as “DEI,” “DEIA,” “equity,” \nor “equity-related,” and thus fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Constitution.  \n137.  The Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 fails to distinguish between \n“Desegregation” targeted by Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and “DEI”, “DEIA,” “equity,” \nor “equity-related,” and thus fails to satisfy the minimum requirements of the Constitution. \n138.  The Termination  Letter  was  issued  pursuant  to  the Termination  Provision  of \nExecutive Order 14151 (§ 2(b)(i)). \n139.  SEF was subjected to the Termination Provision of Executive Order 14151 upon \nreceipt of the Termination Letter and the resulting termination of their EAC-South grant.  \n140.  SEF has been deprived of constitutionally guaranteed rights to due process in the \ntermination of the EAC-South grant.  \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 31 of 38\n \n141.  Executive Order 14151 and the Termination Letter “[fail] to provide a person of \nordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited,” by failing to define “DEI” initiatives or \ndescribe the elements of EAC-South or any program receiving federal grants which it deems to \nviolate anti-discrimination laws.  \n142.  EAC-South is a Civil Rights Act-authorized school desegregation program. If its \nservices are deemed to be “unlawful discrimination the basis of race […] or other protected \ncharacteristic,” as described in the Termination Letter, no “person of ordinary intelligence” could \npossibly  understand  what  programs  are  not  prohibited  by  Executive  Order  14151  or  the \nTermination Letter. \n143.  Thus,  Executive  Order  14151  and  the  Termination  letter  are  effectively \nstandardless, leaving them vulnerable to discriminatory enforcement. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \n \nViolation of Title V of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 – Failure to Comply with 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1 \n \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n144.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n145.  The Department seems to allege that the EAC-South grant violates Title VI of the \nCivil Rights Act of 1964. \n146.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the \nground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial \nassistance.” \n147.  The Termination Letter states that SEF’s grant “provides funding for programs \nthat promote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 32 of 38\n \nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another protected characteristic” and “that \nviolate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law.” See Exhibit D. \n148.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 requires that federal grants the Department deems \nnoncompliant cannot be terminated “until the department or agency concerned has advised the \nappropriate person or persons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined \nthat compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.”  \n149.  Further, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1 provides that “[i]n the case of any action \nterminating, or refusing to grant or continue, assistance because of failure to comply with a \nrequirement imposed pursuant to this section, the head of the Federal department or agency shall \nfile with the committees of the House and Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program \nor activity involved a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action.” \nTerminations are not effective until thirty days after filing said report. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. \n150.  The Department did not advise SEF of the failure to comply with any requirement \nprior to its termination of the EAC-South grant.  \n151.  The Department did not determine that compliance could not be secured through \nvoluntary means. \n152.  To SEF’s knowledge, the Department did not file with the pertinent House and \nSenate committees a full written report of the circumstances and grounds for termination. \n153.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to law in violation of the APA. \nSIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires – Impoundment of Congressionally Appropriated Funds \n(Against All Defendants) \n154.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 33 of 38\n \n155.  SEF has a non-statutory right of action to seek an injunction against unlawful \nofficial action that is ultra vires.  See Chamber of Commerce v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1327-8 \n(1996).   \n156.  This Court has inherent equitable power to enjoin executive conduct that violates \nthe Constitution.  See Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 \nU.S.  477,  n.2  (2010).   And  “the  President’s  actions  may  ...  be  reviewed  for \nconstitutionality.”  Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992) (citations omitted).   \n157.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 326-7 (2015).  The Supreme Court has thus allowed equitable relief against federal \nofficials who act “beyond th[e] limitations” imposed by federal statute. Larson v. Domestic & \nForeign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).  \n158.  The  President  and  the  Department  lack  the  authority  to  immediately  and \ncategorically terminate grant funding that has been appropriated by Congress, based on a policy \ndisagreement with aggregate spending levels set by Congress or to reorder spending priorities \ninconsistent with congressional budgetary determinations.   \n159.  Indeed, the Executive Branch itself has long recognized that “the suggestion that \nthe President has the constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated funds … is supported \nby neither reason nor precedent.”  Presidential Authority to Impound Funds Appropriated for \nAssistance to Federally Impacted Schools, 1 Supp. Op. O.L.C. 303, 309 (1969) (Rehnquist, \nA.A.G.).  \n160.  The United States Supreme Court in Brown v. Board of Education ruled that \nsegregation in public education is unconstitutional. Brown v. Bd. of Ed. of Topeka, Shawnee Cnty., \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 34 of 38\n \nKan., 347 U.S. 483 (1954), supplemented sub nom. Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Kan., 349 \nU.S. 294 (1955).  \n161.  The United States Congress enacted Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to carry \nout  the Brown v. Board of  Education  ruling. The Department’s termination of SEF’s grant \nundermines the Title IV of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. \nBoard of Education. \n162.  The Take Care Clause forbids the President from refusing to faithfully execute the \nlaws of the United States, including spending laws.  See id. at 311.   \n163.  The Appropriations  Clause  states  that  “[n]o  Money  shall  be  drawn  from  the \nTreasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.   \n164.  The Appropriations Clause was designed to “assure that public funds will be spent \naccording to the letter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and \nnot according to the individual favor of Government agents.”  Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, \n496 U.S. 414, 428 (1990).  \n165.  The Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. §§ 681 et seq., circumscribes the \nExecutive Branch’s authority to categorically terminate or modify obligated grant funding.  The \nImpoundment Control Act permits the Executive Branch to impound (i.e., decline to spend) federal \nfunds only under narrow circumstances.  2 U.S.C. §§ 683, 684.    \n166.  The Impoundment Control Act does not permit the Executive Branch to defer \nappropriated funds based on policy disagreements with congressional priorities, id. § 684(b), nor \nto rescind funds without Congressional approval, id. § 683. \n167.  The President has not transmitted a special message to Congress requesting that the \nfunding associated with terminated grants be rescinded or deferred, and Congress has not rescinded \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 35 of 38\n \nany such appropriations.  The President is thus required by the Impoundment Control Act to \nexpend the appropriated funding. \n168.  Defendants have committed extreme error and have stepped so plainly beyond the \nbounds of their statutory authority, or acted so clearly in defiance of it, as to warrant the immediate \nintervention of an equity court.  \n169.  Defendants have patently misconstrued the APA such that they disregard a specific \nand unambiguous statutory directive. \nSEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution (Free Speech Clause)  \n(Against All Defendants) \n170.  All preceding paragraphs are incorporated herein by reference. \n171.  “Discrimination  against  speech  because  of  its  message  is  presumed  to  be \nunconstitutional.” Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Virginia, 515 U.S. 819, 829 (1995). \n“When the government targets not subject matter, but particular views taken by speakers on a \nsubject, the violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant.” Id.  \n172.  This restriction applies to government grantees. Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for \nOpen Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214-15 (2013). The government may not impose limitations \non grantees based on viewpoint. Id. \n173.  The Termination Letter makes several overly broad and vague allegations regarding \nSEF’s grant: (1) that it “provides funding for programs that promote or take part in DEI initiatives \nor other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national \norigin, or another protected characteristic,” (2) that the grant provides funding for programs that \notherwise “violate either the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law,” or (3) that the grant \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 36 of 38\n \nprovides funding for programs “that conflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, \nfairness, and excellence in education.”  \n174.  The Termination Letter then states that SEF’s grant “is therefore inconsistent with, \nand no longer effectuates, Department priorities.” See Exhibit D.  \n175.  The Department’s termination of SEF’s grant constitutes viewpoint discrimination. \n176.  The  Executive  Order  14151  and  Termination  Letter  constitute  content-based \nregulations of speech because they discourage federal grantees from expressing support for, \nconducting academic research relating to, or for in any way speaking about initiatives that create \nequitable educational environments for all students, regardless of race.  \n177.  In particular, the failure to define prohibited “DEI initiatives” simultaneously with \nthe sudden punishment of grant termination chills the speech of federal grantees, including SEF \nand EAC-South, who engage in protected speech activities. \n178.  The Department failed to define “DEI initiatives” and failed to specify how SEF’s \ngrant funds programs that discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or \nanother protected characteristic. \n179.  The Department’s actions target SEF’s speech and expressive conduct; specifically, \nEAC-South’s technical assistance, including its trainings and written work product that contain \nterms and references to creating equal access to educational opportunities, authorized by Title IV \nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to carry out the Supreme Court decision in Brown. \n180.  The Department’s grant termination  targets  and aims to suppress a particular \nviewpoint that promotes the value of providing equitable educational opportunities, rather than \ntargeting all viewpoints on the subject matter of educational equity equally, for example, by also \ntargeting programs that advocate against “diversity,” “equity,” or “inclusion.” \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 37 of 38\n \n181.  Defendants’ conduct with respect to SEF’s grant termination threatens to chill SEF \nand other grantees’ speech; it stigmatizes SEF and EAC-South based on their viewpoint by \ndenouncing  their  work  as  discriminatory  and  unlawful;  jeopardizing  their  trust  with  the \ncommunities they serve and damaging their reputation; and it denies EAC-South access to \nfederally authorized funding based solely on its perceived association with a particular viewpoint. \n182.  Defendants’ termination is contrary to First Amendment protections under the \nConstitution. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court:  \na.  Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ termination of the EAC-South grant; \nb.  Declare unlawful and set aside Defendants’ action placing Plaintiff’s grant on route \npay;  \nc.  Order a temporary restraining order and preliminary and a permanent injunction \norder (a) enjoining the Defendants from enforcing the Termination Provision of Executive Order \n14151 and the February 13, 2025, termination letter sent to the Plaintiff from the Department; (b) \nordering such grant funding reinstated forthwith; and (c) ordering the Defendants to provide SEF \nreimbursement  for  all  outstanding  expenses  and  otherwise  allowable  expenditures  incurred \nbetween the date of termination and this Court’s order; \nd.  Order the Defendants to rescind the February 13, 2025, Termination Letter and \nreinstate the federal grant for the EAC-South to the same extent and in the same manner as prior \nto the unlawful termination, as provided in the terms of the grant;  \ne.  Award the Plaintiff costs and reasonable attorney fees; and  \nf.  Grant such other relief as this Court may deem just and proper.  \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079     Document 1     Filed 04/09/25     Page 38 of 38\n \n \nDated: April 9, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n/s/ Lucrecia P.

(“SEF”) has worked to advance equitable education \npractices and policies in the South.  From educating formerly enslaved persons after the Civil \nWar to advocating against the then-lawful practice of segregation in public education, SEF has \ndedicated itself to fostering academic opportunity for over 150 years.  In 2022, the United States \nDepartment of Education (“the Department”) recognized SEF’s work by awarding SEF a federal \ngrant to operate EAC-South, a technical assistance center designed to confront federal school \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 2 of 37\ndesegregation cases in the South.  Since receiving the grant, SEF has invested significant time \nand resources into operating EAC-South. \nBut EAC-South’s programming grinded to a halt when the Department terminated \nSEF’s grant award on February 13, 2025.  The basis for the termination:  the Department’s \nefforts to eliminate “[i]llegal [diversity, equity, and inclusion] policies and practices.”  In view of \nthe history of race in America and the mission of SEF since the Civil War, the audacity of \nterminating its grants based on “DEI” concerns is truly breathtaking.   \nOn April 23, 2025, SEF filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, challenging \nthe Department’s decision to terminate SEF’s grant and requesting immediate injunctive relief.  \nSee Plaintiff’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order (“Pl. Mot.”) \n[Dkt. No. 11].  The Court held oral argument on SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction on \nMay 12, 2025.  Upon careful consideration of the parties’ filings, the oral arguments, and the \nrelevant legal authorities, the Court concludes that SEF is likely to succeed on the merits of its \nAPA claims.  The Court therefore will grant SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction.1 \n \n \n \n \n  1  The Court has reviewed the following documents and attachments thereto in \nconnection with the pending motion:  Complaint (“Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 1]; Plaintiff’s Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order [Dkt. No. 11]; Plaintiff’s Memorandum of \nLaw in Support of its Motion for Preliminary Injunction/Temporary Restraining Order \n(“Pl. Mot.”) [Dkt. No. 11-1]; Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction (“Defs. Opp.”) [Dkt. No. 18]; Plaintiff’s Reply In Further Support of its Motion for \nPreliminary Injunction (“Pl. Rep.”) [Dkt. No. 19]; Plaintiff’s Consent Motion to Supplement the \nRecord (“Pl. Mot. to Suppl.”) [Dkt. No. 25]; and Plaintiff’s Supplemental Complaint For \nDeclaratory and Injunctive Relief (“Am. Compl.”) [Dkt. No. 26]. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 3 of 37\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Plaintiff \nAfter the Civil War ended in 1865 – and the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth \nAmendments were added to our Constitution – foundations were formed to train qualified \nteachers, provide educational materials, and build schools for the education of formerly enslaved \npersons and poor Whites in southern states.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 25.  In 1937, most of these \nfoundations were consolidated to form what is now the Southern Education Foundation, the \nplaintiff in this case.  See id.  For over 150 years, SEF “has advanced equitable education \npolicies across the Southern United States, including supporting Thurgood Marshall’s legal team \nin Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954).”  Pl. Mot. at 1.   \n     \nB.  The Grant Program \nTo effectuate the Supreme Court’s ruling in Brown v. Board of Education to \ndesegregate schools “with all deliberate speed,” Congress enacted Title IV of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964 (“Title IV”), which directs the Department of Education to provide technical \nassistance to facilitate public school desegregation initiatives.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 28-29; see \nalso 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000c et seq.  The Department established “Desegregation Assistance \nCenters” (“the Centers”) to “provide technical assistance in the preparation, adoption, and \nimplementation of plans for [the] desegregation of public schools.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 29; see also \n42 U.S.C. § 2000c-2; 34 C.F.R. § 270.1.  Though the Centers’ work initially focused on \ndesegregation, see Am. Compl. ¶ 29, they later expanded to helping all students excel \nacademically, “regardless of race, sex, national origin, linguistic differences, cultural and social \ncharacteristics, economic circumstances, and disability.”  Id. \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 4 of 37\nIn 2016, the Department renamed the Centers from “Desegregation Assistance \nCenters” to “Equity Assistance Centers” (“EACs”) to reflect the Centers’ broadened mission.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 30.  Today, the EAC Program is “one of the Department’s longest-standing \ninvestments in technical assistance and plays a vital role in ensuring that all students have \nequitable access to learning opportunities . . . .”  Program History, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., \nhttps://www.ed.gov/grants-and-programs/grants-birth-grade-12/training-and-advisory-services--\nequity-assistance-centers [https://perma.cc/NT7E-2UTV] (last visited Apr. 29, 2025). \nEvery year, Congress has appropriated funds under Title IV for training and \ntechnical assistance and has directed the Department to distribute those funds.  See Am. Compl. \n¶ 5.  The Department of Education then obligates these grant funds through the EAC Program.  \nSee id.  Following a competitive application process, the Department awards grants to eligible \nentities, and the entities use the grant funds “to operate regional centers that offer technical \nassistance at the request of public schools.”  See Defs. Opp. at 2.  After signing cooperative grant \nagreements with the Department, the grantees draw down (or spend) the obligated funds during a \npre-approved budget period until September 30th of each budget year.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 5.   \n \nC.  SEF’s Grant and Cooperative Agreement \nOn February 15, 2022, the Department published a Notice Inviting Applications \nfor the FY 2022 EAC grant competition.  See 87 F.R. 8564-8570; Am. Compl. ¶ 41.  The Notice \nstated that grants would be awarded for a maximum period of five years.  See 87 F.R. 8567.  The \nEAC competition included the following Priority:  Promoting Equity Through Diverse \nPartnerships.  See 87 F.R. 8566; Am. Compl. ¶ 42.  The EAC grant program’s authorizing \nstatutes set forth grant application procedures.  See 37 C.F.R. 270. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 5 of 37\nOn May 16, 2022, SEF submitted an application for a grant to operate the EAC \nprogram for Region II, or “EAC-South.”  See Am. Compl. ¶ 43.  EAC-South “addresses \neducational disparities based on race, national origin, sex, and religion” in “Alabama, Arkansas, \nFlorida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, \nVirginia, and the District of Columbia.”  Pl. Mot. at 1-2.  As of May 2024, the states in Region II \ncontained 130 of the 132 open federal school desegregation cases.  See id.; see also id. at Ex. 1 \n[Dkt. No. 11-4] at 13.  In its grant application, SEF outlined a five-year plan for the grant \nfunding and provided annual milestones it hoped to reach, one of which was the “implementation \nof targeted and intensive technical assistance to public schools” in the South, with a “specific \nfocus on the active school desegregation cases in federal courts.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 44.   \nIn October 2022, the Department awarded SEF a five-year discretionary grant \nunder Title IV to operate EAC-South.  See Compl. at Ex. B [Dkt. No. 1-2]; see also Am. Compl. \n¶ 45; Defs. Opp. at 2.  The grant totaled $8.6 million.  See Defs. Opp. at 2.  The grant is the “sole \nsource of funding for EAC-South.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 45.  The initial Grant Award Notification \n(“GAN”) letter that SEF received from the Department contained details about the grant, budget \nperiods, and compliance provisions.  See id. at Ex. B.  The GAN letter classifies SEF’s grant \naward as “a cooperative agreement,” Compl. at Ex. B; see also Defs. Opp. at 2, with the terms of \nthe agreement set forth in a separate document.  See Pl. Mot. at Ex. 1 at 31. \nSince receiving the grant, “SEF, through EAC-South, has provided free services \nto public schools within [Region II],” including consulting with school districts to improve \nstudent equity, helping teachers foster an environment for all students to succeed, “and other \nservices related to addressing elements of segregation in public education.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 47. \n \n \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 6 of 37\nD.  Change of Administration and Executive Orders \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump was sworn in as President of the United \nStates.  That same day, he signed Executive Order 14151, titled “Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing.”  See Exec. Order No. 14151, Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (In \norder to “mak[e] America great,” all DEI programs “end[] today”).  Executive Order 14151 \ndirects “[e]ach agency, department, or commission head” to, inter alia, “terminate, to the \nmaximum extent allowed by law . . .  all ‘equity action plans,’ ‘equity’ actions, initiatives, or \nprograms, [and] ‘equity-related’ grants or contracts . . . .’”  Id. § 2(b)(1), Implementation (“the \nTermination Provision”) (emphasis added). \n    The next day, on January 21, 2025, President Trump signed Executive \nOrder 14173, titled “Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity.”  \nSee Exec. Order No. 14173, Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based \nOpportunity, 90 Fed. Reg. 8633 (Jan. 21, 2025).  Ostensibly in order to enforce “longstanding \ncivil-rights laws and to combat illegal private-sector DEI preferences, mandates, policies, \nprograms, and activities,” § 2, Executive Order 14173 directs “all executive departments and \nagencies” to “terminate all discriminatory and illegal preferences, mandates, policies, programs, \nactivities, guidance, regulations, enforcement actions, consent orders, and requirements.”  Exec. \nOrder No. 14173 at § 2.  \n \nE.  February 2025 Termination of SEF’s Grant \nOn February 13, 2025, SEF received a letter from the Department, which reads: \nThis letter provides notice that the United States Department of \nEducation is terminating your federal award, S004D220011. See 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340–43; see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.523.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 7 of 37\nIt  is  a  priority  of  the  Department  of  Education  to  eliminate \ndiscrimination  in  all  forms  of  education  throughout  the  United \nStates. The Acting Secretary of Education has determined that, per \nthe Department’s obligations to the constitutional and statutory law \nof  the  United  States,  this  priority  includes  ensuring  that  the \nDepartment’s grants do not support programs or organizations that \npromote or take part in diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) \ninitiatives or any other initiatives that unlawfully discriminate on the \nbasis  of  race,  color,  religion,  sex,  national  origin,  or  another \nprotected  characteristic.  Illegal  DEI  policies  and  practices  can \nviolate both the letter and purpose of Federal civil rights law and \nconflict with the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, \nand excellence in education. In addition to complying with the civil \nrights laws, it is vital that the Department assess whether all grant \npayments are free from fraud, abuse, and duplication, as well as to \nassess whether current grants are in the best interests of the United \nStates.  \nThe  grant  specified  above  provides  funding  for  programs  that \npromote or take part in DEI initiatives or other initiatives that \nunlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, \nnational  origin,  or  another  protected  characteristic;  that  violate \neither the letter or purpose of Federal civil rights law; that conflict \nwith the Department’s policy of prioritizing merit, fairness, and \nexcellence in education; that are not free from fraud, abuse, or \nduplication; or that otherwise fail to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States.  The grant is therefore inconsistent with, and no \nlonger  effectuates,  Department  priorities.    See  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4); see also 34 C.F.R. § 75.253.  Therefore, pursuant \nto, among other authorities, 2 C.F.R. § 200.339–43, 34 C.F.R. \n§ 75.253, and the termination provisions in your grant award, the \nDepartment  hereby  terminates  grant  No.  S004D220011  in  its \nentirety effective 2/13/25. \nCompl. at Ex. D (“the Termination Letter”) [Dkt. No. 1-4].  In addition to the Termination \nLetter, SEF received an updated GAN letter that stated that its grant is “deemed to be \ninconsistent with, and no longer effectuates, Department priorities.”  Compl. at Ex. E \n[Dkt. No. 1-5] (citing 2 C.F.R. 200.340(a)(4) and 34 C.F.R. 75.253).  \n    The Termination Letter set forth an informal appeal process for SEF to follow if it \n“wish[ed] to object to or challenge” the termination of its grant.  Compl. at Ex. D.  The Letter \ndirected SEF to “submit information and documentation supporting [its] position in writing \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 8 of 37\nwithin 30 calendar days of the date of this termination notice.”  Id.  The Letter mandated that an \n“appeal should contain the following: 1. a copy of the written notice of termination; 2. the date \nyou received written notice of termination; 3. a brief statement of your argument and the \ndisputed factual, legal, or other issues; 4. the amount of funds or costs in dispute, if any; \nand 5. any other relevant documents.”  Id.  Lastly, the Letter provided the name and contact \ninformation of the Department official to whom appeals should be forwarded.  See id. \n    SEF submitted a timely appeal to the Department on or about March 10, 2025, see \nAm. Compl. ¶ 90, then withdrew its appeal on May 16, 2025.  Id. ¶ 92.  On May 14, 2025, the \nDepartment of Education remitted an electronic payment of $293,681.78 for outstanding \nexpenses incurred by SEF on or before February 13, 2025, the date of the grant termination.  Id. \n¶ 93.  “In spite of this payment,” the EAC-South grant remains terminated.  Id.  As a result of the \ngrant termination, SEF alleges that it has lost the “sole source of funding for EAC-South,” \nid. ¶ 75, and is “currently unable to operate EAC-South.”  Id. ¶ 80.  SEF alleges that “the loss of \nfunding is economic harm so significant that it threatens the very existence of EAC-South.”  \nId. ¶ 76.  Specifically, SEF alleges that the termination of the grant “will result in [a] $3,371,108 \noverall loss,” id. ¶ 88, “the loss of employment for the dedicated staff and partners who ensure \nEAC-South run daily,” Am. Compl. ¶ 83, and “[the] loss of goodwill and injury to reputation \nwith the school districts [SEF] service[s] through EAC-South.”  Id. ¶ 84. \n \nF.  Procedural History \nOn April 9, 2025, SEF filed this lawsuit against Donald J. Trump, in his official \ncapacity as President of the United States, Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as Secretary \nof Education, and the Department of Education.  See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 22-24.  SEF claims that the \nDepartment’s termination of SEF’s grant violates the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 9 of 37\nsee Pl. Mot. at 7-13 (Counts One, Two, and Three); the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, see id. at 16-17 (Count Four); Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, see id. at 13-16 \n(Count Five); the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, see id. at 21-19 (Count \nSeven); and constitutes an ultra vires act of impoundment of congressionally approved funds.  Pl. \nMot. at 17-21 (Count Six).  SEF seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.  See Am. Compl. at 37-\n38.  As noted, SEF filed a motion for a preliminary injunction/temporary restraining order, see \nPl. Mot., and the Court held oral argument on the motion on May 12, 2025. \nOn May 16, 2025, SEF filed a consent motion to supplement the record pursuant \nto Rule 15(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Consent Motion to Supplement the \nRecord (“Pl. Mot. to Suppl.”) [Dkt. No. 25].  To its motion, SEF attached a letter that it sent to \nthe Department on May 12, 2025, formally withdrawing its administrative appeal challenging the \nDepartment’s grant termination decision.  Id. at Ex. A [Dkt. No. 25-1].  The Court granted SEF’s \nmotion by minute order, and gave SEF leave to serve a supplemental pleading.  See Minute \nOrder of May 16, 2025.  On May 19, 2025, SEF filed an amended complaint alleging that it had \nwithdrawn its administrative appeal before the Department.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 1.  SEF also \nadvised the Court that the Department had “remitted payment of the outstanding balance \nof $293,681.78 for expenses incurred on or before . . . the date of the [EAC-South] grant’s \ntermination.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 2.   \n \nII.  JURISDICTION \nDefendants argue that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction for two reasons.  \nFirst, they argue that because SEF seeks reinstatement of the grant agreement, its claims sound in \ncontract and therefore belong in the Court of Federal Claims—and not this Court—under the \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 10 of 37\nTucker Act.  See Defs. Opp. at 6-9.  Second, they argue that because SEF administratively \nappealed the Department’s termination decision, SEF’s claims are not ripe. Id. at 9-10.   \n                    \n        A.  The Tucker Act \nBecause the “United States is immune from suit unless it unequivocally \nconsents,” Maine Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 322 (2020), a plaintiff \nrequesting emergency relief against the government must “identify an unequivocal waiver of \nsovereign immunity.”  Franklin-Mason v. Mabus, 742 F.3d 1051, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  SEF \npoints to Section 702 of the APA as such a waiver that applies to it.  See Pl. Mot. at 18 (citing 5 \nU.S.C. § 702).  Indeed, the APA provides “a limited waiver of sovereign immunity” for persons \n“adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action.”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. \nAdmin. (“Crowley”), 38 F.4th 1099, 1105-06 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  But \nSection 702’s waiver is not without limits:  For one, it only applies to claimants “seeking relief \nother than money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  For another, “Section 702’s sovereign immunity \nwaiver does not apply [ ] ‘if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly \nforbids the relief which is sought.’”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting Perry Cap. LLC v. \nMnuchin (“Perry Cap. LLC”), 864 F.3d 591, 618 (D.C. Cir. 2017) and 5 U.S.C. § 702).   \nDefendants contend that the Tucker Act “impliedly forbids” the APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity in this case.  See Defs. Opp. at 6.  The Tucker Act waives the government’s \nsovereign immunity from actions “founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the \nUnited States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  The D.C. Circuit has explained that the Tucker Act \ngrants the Court of Federal Claims “exclusive jurisdiction over breach of contract claims against \nthe United States seeking more than $10,000 in damages.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting \nHammer v. United States, 989 F.3d 1, 2 (D.C. Cir. 2021)) (emphasis added).  So if SEF’s claims \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 11 of 37\nare “‘at [their] essence’ contractual,” then they fall within the scope of the Tucker Act and this \nCourt has no power to resolve them.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. \nLewis (“Megapulse”), 672 F.2d 959, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1982)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 702 (providing \nthat the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity is inapplicable where “any other \nstatute . . . impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”).   \nThe Supreme Court has cautioned, however, that “[n]ot every claim invoking the \nConstitution, a federal statute, or a regulation is cognizable under the Tucker Act.”  United \nStates v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206, 216 (1983).  For example, the Court of Federal Claims \ngenerally is not the appropriate forum to consider requests for injunctive relief because it “has no \npower to grant equitable relief.”  Bowen v. Massachusetts (“Bowen”), 487 U.S. 879, 905 (1988) \n(quoting Richardson v. Morris, 409 U.S. 464, 465 (1973) (per curiam)).  The D.C. Circuit has \nalso made clear that the Tucker Act should not be interpreted “so broad[ly] as to deny a court \njurisdiction to consider a claim that is validly based on grounds other than a contractual \nrelationship with the government.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968.  “[T]he mere fact that a court \nmay have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, \nautomatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the court of \njurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 (emphasis added).  Further, \n“[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a \nsufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages’” such that Section 702 of the \nAPA’s waiver of sovereign immunity is inapplicable.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893.    \n                    \nB.  The Essence of SEF’s Claims \nTo determine whether jurisdiction over this action lies with this Court or with the \nCourt of Federal Claims, the Court must assess whether SEF’s claims are “at [their] essence” \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 12 of 37\ncontract claims such that they fall under the Tucker Act.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting \nMegapulse, 672 F.2d at 967-68).2  That inquiry hinges on (1) “the source of the rights upon \nwhich [SEF] bases its claims,” and (2) “the type of relief sought (or appropriate).”  Crowley, 38 \nF.4th at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968); see also Widakuswara v. Lake \n(“Widakuswara II”), Civil Action No. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1288817, at *3 (D.C. Cir. \nMay 3, 2025) (finding that Megapulse’s “rights and remedies” rule also “applies to claims for \nbreach of grant agreements executed through binding government contracts.”) (citing Columbus \nReg’l Hosp. v. United States, 990 F.3d 1330, 1338-40 (Fed. Cir. 2021)).  \nThe Court concludes that it has subject matter jurisdiction over this action because \nSEF’s claims are not “in essence” contract claims and therefore jurisdiction does not lie \nexclusively in the Court of Federal Claims.  See Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 967-68; Climate United \nFund v. Citibank, N.A. (“Climate United Fund”), Civil Action No. 25-698 (TSC), 2025 \nWL 1131412, at *9-10 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025); AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. United States \nDep’t of State (“AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal.”), Civil Action No. 25-0400 (AHA), 2025 WL \n752378, at *9 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025). \n \n1.  The “Rights and Remedies” Rule of Megapulse \nFirst, the source of SEF’s rights.  In identifying the source of a plaintiff’s rights, \ncourts must consider factors such as whether “the plaintiff’s asserted rights and the government’s \n \n  2  SEF argued—for the first time at oral argument—that the cooperative agreement \nbetween SEF and the Department does not qualify as a “contract” for purposes of the Tucker \nAct.  See Transcript of Record, Southern Education Foundation v. U.S. Department of \nEducation, Case No. 25-1079 (May 13, 2025) [Dkt. No. 22] at 5:8-7:3.  The Court need not \nresolve that issue because, even assuming the cooperative agreement constitutes a “contract,” the \nMegapulse test makes clear that the cooperative agreement is not the source of the rights upon \nwhich SEF bases its claims. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 13 of 37\npurported authority arise from statute,” and “whether the plaintiff’s rights exist prior to and apart \nfrom rights created under the contract.”  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1107 (quoting Megapulse, 672 \nF.2d at 969 and Spectrum Leasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(internal quotations and alterations omitted)).  Defendants argue that SEF’s “APA and non-APA \nclaims are all based expressly on [SEF’s] grant and cooperative agreement,” and therefore the \n“source of the rights upon which [SEF] bases its suit is [EAC-South’s] grant award and \ncooperative agreement (S004D220011).”  Defs. Opp. at 7.  The Court recognizes that SEF’s \nclaims implicate the grant agreement; indeed, SEF would have no standing to advance its claims \nbefore this Court if the Department had not terminated the grant agreement.  But as noted, the \n“mere fact that a court may have to rule on a contract issue does not, by triggering some mystical \nmetamorphosis, automatically transform an action . . . into one on the contract and deprive the \ncourt of jurisdiction it might otherwise have.”  Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968 (emphasis added); \nsee also Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110 (“Granted, [plaintiff’s] claim presupposes the existence of a \ncontract, as without one the [defendant] would have no invoices to audit . . . [b]ut the right \n[plaintiff] seeks to vindicate is not a contract right and its action in district court only ‘require[s] \nsome reference to or incorporation of [the] contract.’” (citation omitted)). \nThis lawsuit is not at its essence a suit to vindicate a contractual right to grant \nfunds or about a breach of a grant agreement’s terms.  Rather, SEF’s claims turn entirely on \nexamining the federal statutes and regulations governing SEF’s grant award.  While a grant \nagreement may operate as a contract, the Court need not look to the terms of the grant agreement \nat all to adjudicate SEF’s claims.  See AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. at *9 (“[I]t would be quite \nextraordinary to consider Plaintiffs’ claims to sound in breach of contract when they do not at all \ndepend on whether the terms of particular awards were breached—they instead challenge \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 14 of 37\nwhether the agency action here was unlawful, irrespective of any breach.”); see also Maryland \nDep’t of Hum. Res. v. Dep’t. of Health and Hum. Servs., 763 F.2d 1441, 1449 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(concluding that though plaintiff’s “claims arise under a federal grant program,” they “turn on \nthe interpretation of statutes and regulations rather than on the interpretation of an agreement \nnegotiated by the parties” and therefore “are not contract claims for Tucker Act purposes.”); \nClimate United Fund at *10 (holding that terminated grant agreements were not the source of \ngrantee-plaintiffs’ statutory and constitutional claims).   \nSecond, the type of relief SEF seeks.  SEF does not seek money damages.  SEF \nrequests this Court to enjoin defendants from terminating SEF’s EAC-South grant award and \nfrom “withholding any funds due to [SEF] under the grant or taking any adverse action based on \nthe February 13, 2025, Termination Letter.”  Pl. Mot. at Proposed Order [Dkt. No. 11-7].  SEF \nalso asks the Court to direct defendants to “restore [SEF’s] access to all grant funds.”  Id.  \nDefendants argue that SEF “seek[s] a contractual remedy in the form of an order to essentially \npay money due under the grant and Cooperative Agreement.”  Defs. Opp. at 7.  But as previously \nnoted, “[t]he fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money to another is not a \nsufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 893; see \nalso Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1108 (“[E]xclusive jurisdiction in Claims Court under the Tucker Act \ndoes not lie ‘merely because [a plaintiff] hints at some interest in a monetary reward from the \nfederal government or because success on the merits may obligate the United States to pay the \ncomplainant.’”) (quoting Kidwell v. Dep’t of Army (“Kidwell”), 56 F.3d 279, 284 (D.C. \nCir. 1995)); Kidwell, 56 F.3d at 284 (“[A] claim is not for money merely because its success \nmay lead to pecuniary costs for the government or benefits for the plaintiff.”) (internal quotations \nomitted); Vietnam Veterans v. Sec’y of the Navy, 843 F.2d 528, 534 (D.C. Cir. 1988). \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 15 of 37\nNor does SEF ask the Court to order specific performance under the grant \nagreement.  Rather, SEF seeks equitable relief vindicating its rights under federal statutes and the \nConstitution, and asks the Court to “declare [the Department’s termination of the grant] unlawful \nand set [it] aside.”  Am. Compl. at 37; see also 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) (providing that courts \n“shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that violates the APA’s substantive \nstandards).  That is “precisely the relief that is afforded—indeed, required—by and routinely \ngranted under the APA.”  AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 2025 WL 752378, at *8.  Any money \nthat flows to SEF as a result of this action “would not come from [this] court’s exercise of \njurisdiction, but from the structure of statutory and regulatory requirements governing \ncompensation.”  Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 175 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  \nSEF’s requested relief therefore “is not a claim for money damages, although it is a claim that \nwould require the payment of money by the federal government.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 894.  \nBecause SEF’s “rights and remedies” do not sound in contract, this Court—not the Court of \nFederal Claims—is the appropriate forum to adjudicate SEF’s suit.   \n \n               2.  The Case Law  \nTo support their argument that the Court of Federal Claims has exclusive \njurisdiction over this action, defendants cite two recent appellate opinions—one from the \nSupreme Court and one from the D.C. Circuit—that examine the Tucker Act’s applicability to \nfederal grant termination cases.  The Court addresses each in turn. \n \n           a.  Department of Education v. California \nOn April 4, 2025, the Supreme Court issued a per curiam opinion in Department \nof Education v. California (“Department of Education”).  145 S. Ct. 966 (2025).  There, the \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 16 of 37\nplaintiffs were grantees of the Department, see id. at 968, until they received termination letters \nstating that their grants had been terminated because the grants “provide[ ] funding for programs \nthat promote or take part in [diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)] initiatives or other initiatives \nthat unlawfully discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, or another \nprotected characteristic . . . .”  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Education, 132 F.4th 92, 95 (1st \nCir. 2025).  Plaintiffs brought suit, challenging the Department’s termination of their \ngrants under the APA.  See Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 968.   \nThe district court entered a temporary restraining order, finding that the plaintiffs \nwere likely to succeed on the merits of their APA claims and requiring the Department to restore \nthe status quo as it stood prior to the terminations.  See California v. U.S. Dep’t of Education, \nCivil Action No. 25-10548 (MJJ), 2025 WL 760825, at *5 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  \nSpecifically, the TRO enjoined the government from terminating the grants and required the \ngovernment to “pay out past-due grant obligations and to continue paying obligations as they \naccrued” to the plaintiffs.  Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 968.  The government \nappealed and moved for a stay pending appeal, which was denied.  See id.  The government then \nfiled an application with the Supreme Court to vacate the TRO.  See id. \nThe Supreme Court stayed the district court’s TRO.  See Department of \nEducation, 145 S. Ct. at 969.  The Court found that “the APA’s limited waiver of [sovereign] \nimmunity does not extend” to the district court’s injunction, which the Court construed as an \n“order[ ] ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money.’”  Id. at 968 (quoting Great-West \nLife & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson (“Great-West Life”), 534 U.S. 204, 212 (2002)).  The Court \nacknowledged that “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order \nsetting aside an agency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds.”  Id. (quoting \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 17 of 37\nBowen, 487 U.S. at 910).  But the Court nonetheless concluded that the district court likely \n“lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” because “the Tucker Act \ngrants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any express or implied \ncontract with the United States.’”  Id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)).  The Court suggested \nthat because plaintiffs’ claims to continued grant payments arose from the Department’s \ncontractual obligations under the grant agreements, the suit was governed by the Tucker Act and \nthus belonged in the Court of Federal Claims.  See id.  \nThe instant case is distinguishable from Department of Education.  First, the \nplaintiffs in Department of Education brought only APA claims; they did not assert that the \nDepartment violated any other statutory provisions or infringed the United States Constitution.  \nSee California v. U.S. Dep’t of Education, 2025 WL 760825, at *2.  Here, SEF alleges that the \nDepartment violated the APA, the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Impoundment Control Act \nof 1974, the U.S. Constitution, and various other statutes and regulations.  See supra Section I.F.  \nSecond, the Supreme Court found that the plaintiffs in Department of Education would not suffer \nirreparable harm sufficient to preclude a stay because they had “the financial wherewithal to \nkeep their programs running” without the grants, such that any irreparable harm “would be of \ntheir own making.”  Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 969.  That is not the case here—the \ngrant was EAC-South’s “sole source of funding.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 45.  SEF alleges that it is \n“currently unable to operate EAC-South,” id. ¶ 80, and that the grant termination has inflicted \n“economic harm so significant that it threatens the very existence of EAC-South.”  Id. ¶ 76.   \nLastly, the Supreme Court’s stay order in Department of Education does not \ndisplace governing law that guides this Court’s assessment of whether SEF’s claims are \nessentially contract claims such that jurisdiction properly lies with the Court of Federal Claims.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 18 of 37\nSee Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. at 968 (citing Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910).  For example, \nin Bowen, the Supreme Court drew a “distinction between an action at law” for money damages, \nwhich provides monetary compensation, and “an equitable action for specific relief,” which \nmight still require monetary relief.  See 487 U.S. at 893; see also Great-West Life, 534 U.S. \nat 213 (“Whether [restitution] is legal or equitable depends on the basis for [the plaintiff’s] claim \nand the nature of the underlying remedies sought.”) (cleaned up).  The Court in Bowen found \nthat even where a district court’s order likely would result in the government paying money to \nthe plaintiff, as it would in the instant case, such payments are not necessarily “money damages,” \nand such orders are not always “excepted from” the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity in \nSection 702.   Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910.  Rather, in such cases, the government’s payment of \nmoney to the plaintiff may be “a mere by-product of [the district] court’s primary function of \nreviewing the Secretary’s interpretation of federal law.”  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 910 (emphasis \nadded); see also id. at 893 (“The fact that a judicial remedy may require one party to pay money \nto another is not a sufficient reason to characterize the relief as ‘money damages.’”).    \nApplying Bowen’s reasoning to the instant case leads to the same conclusion.  \nWhile an order enjoining the Department from terminating SEF’s grant would effectively require \nthe government to keep funding the grant, that is “a mere by-product of [this] court’s primary \nfunction of reviewing the Secretary’s interpretation of federal law.”  See Bowen, 487 U.S. \nat 909-10.  It is “not a sufficient reason to characterize [SEF’s requested] relief as ‘money \ndamages’” such that the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity is inapplicable.  See id. at 893.   \nDefendants make no attempt to square Department of Education with Bowen, and \noffer no reason why the Court should disregard Bowen’s teachings in favor of the Supreme \nCourt’s brief analysis in Department of Education.  See Woonasquatucket River Watershed \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 19 of 37\nCouncil v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Civil Action No. 25-0097 (MSM), 2025 WL 1116157, at *15 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (concluding that the court “cannot disregard Bowen . . . [e]ven if it looks \nlike [Department of Education] has ‘implicitly overruled’” it.).  Absent a clear indication from \nthe Supreme Court that Bowen is no longer good law, the Court applies Bowen’s settled \nprinciples to conclude that SEF’s suit is not necessarily a “contract dispute over money” simply \nbecause the government would have to continue paying grant money to SEF if its requested \nrelief is granted.  See Cmty. Legal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. United States Dep’t of Health & \nHum. Servs., Civil Action No. 25-02847 (AMO), 2025 WL 1168898, at *3 (N.D. Cal. \nApr. 21, 2025) (“Department of Education does not represent a significant change in law.”).3     \n               b.  Widakuswara v. Lake  \nThe D.C. Circuit also recently examined the applicability of the Tucker Act in \nfederal grant termination cases.  In Widakuswara v. Lake, the United States Agency for \nGlobal Media (“USAGM”) terminated two of its affiliates’ grant agreements for the 2025 fiscal \nyear.  See Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *1.  The grantees filed suit in this Court, \n \n  3  It is worth noting that the Supreme Court’s decision in Department of Education \nwas made in the context of an emergency application for a stay pending appeal, with “barebones \nbriefing, no argument,” and two pages of analysis.  See Department of Education, 145 S. Ct. \nat 969 (Kagan, J., dissenting).  Its precedential value therefore is limited.  See Climate \nUnited Fund, 2025 WL 1131412, at *9-12 (concluding that Department of Education does not \nstrip the court of jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ grant termination claims); Rhode Island v. Trump, \nCivil Action No. 25-128 (JJM), 2025 WL 1303868, at *6 (D.R.I. May 6, 2025) (concluding that \nDepartment of Education’s “precedential value is limited,” and “does not render this Court an \nimproper forum for [plaintiffs’] claims under the APA.”); Woonasquatucket River Watershed \nCouncil v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Civil Action No. 25-0097 (MSM), 2025 WL 1116157, at *15 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (finding that the court retains jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ APA claims \nchallenging the government’s federal funding freeze, and Department of Education “is not to the \ncontrary.”); Maine v. United States Dep’t of Agric., Civil Action No. 25-0131 (JAW), 2025 \nWL 1088946, at *19 n.8 (D. Me. Apr. 11, 2025) (“The Supreme Court’s April 4, 2025 decision \n[in Department of Education] does not change the Court’s determination that it is a proper \nforum for this dispute under the APA.”). \n \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 20 of 37\nchallenging the USAGM’s termination of their grants, bringing claims under the APA, \nthe United States Constitution, various congressional appropriations acts, “and numerous other \nstatutory provisions.”  Widakuswara v. Lake (Widakuswara I”), Civil Action No. 25-1015 \n(RCL), 2025 WL 1166400, at *5 (D.D.C. Apr. 22, 2025).  Judge Lamberth granted plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction, and ordered the government to “restore the FY 2025 \ngrants” and “disburse[ ] to [the grantees] the funds Congress appropriated.”  Id. at *18.  The \ngovernment appealed to the D.C. Circuit and filed a motion to stay this Court’s order to restore \nthe grantees’ fiscal year 2025 grants.  See Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *2.     \nA motions panel of the D.C. Circuit granted the government’s motion for a stay, \nfinding that this Court likely lacked jurisdiction to restore the grants.  See Widakuswara II, 2025 \nWL 1288817, at *1, 3.  Relying on the Supreme Court’s opinion in Department of Education, the \npanel majority found that the government, through its grant agreement with the plaintiffs, \n“promised to pay the appropriated funds” and “[i]n return, [plaintiffs] promised to use the funds \nto advance statutory objectives and to comply with all program requirements.”  Id. at *3.  “These \nexchanges of promises—reflecting offer, acceptance, consideration, mutuality of intent, and \naction by an official with authority to bind the government—constitute government contracts for \nTucker Act purposes.”  Id. (citing Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, 990 F.3d at 1338-39).  \nThe panel majority held that “[w]hether phrased as a declaration that [the grant] agreements \nremain in force, or an order to pay the money committed by those agreements,” this Court’s \ninjunction “in substance order[ed] specific performance of the grant agreements—a \nquintessentially contractual remedy.”  Id. at *4.  The panel majority concluded that the \n“inherently contractual nature” of the district court’s relief “makes the [Court of Federal Claims] \nthe exclusive forum for this suit.”  Id. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 21 of 37\nWidakuswara II is an unpublished opinion that may not be binding on this Court.4  \nAnd respectfully, the Court does not find the panel majority’s reasoning persuasive.  The panel \nmajority held that “it is the inherently contractual nature of the relief afforded—not any \ncharacterization of the relief as money damages”—that confers jurisdiction on the Court of \nFederal Claims.  Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *4.  But as Judge Pillard pointed out in \ndissent, it is the “type of relief sought,” not “the inherently contractual nature of the relief \nafforded” that determines whether a plaintiff’s claims are “in essence” contract claims for \npurposes of the Tucker Act.  Widakuswara II, 2025 WL 1288817, at *13 (Pillard, J., dissenting).  \nThe plaintiffs in Widakuswara II sought injunctive and declaratory relief:  “No count [in their \ncomplaint] sound[ed] in contract, and none [sought] money damages for breach.”  Id. (Pillard, J., \ndissenting).  And because the Court of Federal Claims is a specialized forum that can only issue \n“naked money judgment[s] against the United States,” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 905, the injunctive \nrelief the Widakuswara II plaintiffs sought would be unavailable to them in the Court of Federal \nClaims.  See id. (Pillard, J., dissenting). \nFor these reasons, the Court declines to apply the Widakuswara II panel’s \nreasoning to the instant case.5   \n \n  4  D.C. Circuit Rule 32.1(b)(1)(B) provides that unpublished opinions entered on or \nafter January 1, 2002, “may be cited as precedent,” not that the Court must treat them as such.  \nAnd D.C. Circuit Rule 36(e)(2) provides that, “[w]hile unpublished dispositions may be cited to \nthe court . . . a panel’s decision to issue an unpublished disposition means that the panel sees no \nprecedential value in that disposition.”  Read together, these two procedural rules seem to advise \nlitigants that they may cite unpublished opinions as precedent in their court filings, but the \npanel’s decision not to publish the opinion “means that the panel sees no precedential value” in \nthat opinion.  Defendants offer no reason for the Court to imbibe Widakuswara II with \nprecedential value, especially when the Circuit declined to do so itself. \n \n  5  On May 5, 2025, the Widakuswara II plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing en \nbanc.  See Civil Action No. 25-5144 [Dkt. No. 2114398].  At the time of this opinion, the D.C. \n \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 22 of 37\n                 C. Ripeness \n \nDefendants’ second jurisdictional argument is that SEF’s claims are not ripe \nbecause SEF had a “pending” administrative appeal challenging the grant termination.  See Defs. \nOpp. at 9-10.  But on May 12, 2025, SEF withdrew its administrative appeal.  See Pl. Mot. to \nSuppl. at Ex. A.  SEF filed an amended complaint on May 19, 2025, to reflect that it had \nwithdrawn its administrative appeal.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 1.  These developments resolve any risk \nof a concurrent administrative process that might preclude judicial review, and render \ndefendants’ ripeness argument moot.  See Scahill v. D.C., 909 F.3d 1177, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 2018) \n(holding that a plaintiff may cure jurisdictional defects by filing an amended pleading, thereby \navoiding “the unnecessary hassle and expense of filing a new lawsuit when events subsequent to \nfiling the original complaint have fixed the jurisdictional problem.”).   \nRipeness “is a justiciability doctrine” that is “‘drawn both from Article III \nlimitations on judicial power and from prudential reasons for refusing to exercise jurisdiction.’”  \nDevia v. Nuclear Regul. Comm’n (“Devia”), 492 F.3d 421, 424 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (quoting Nat’l \nPark Hospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of the Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807-08 (2003)).  In determining \n“whether the facts of a particular case meet th[e] standard of ripeness,” courts apply a \ntwo-pronged analysis, evaluating (1) the fitness of the issues for judicial decision, and (2) the \nhardship to the parties of withholding court consideration.  See id. at 424; American Petroleum \nInstitute v. EPA (“American Petroleum Institute”), 683 F.3d 382, 387 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  The first \nprong of ripeness—fitness of the issue for judicial decision—turns on three factors:  “[1] whether \n[the issue] is purely legal, [2] whether consideration of the issue would benefit from a more \n \nCircuit has not yet resolved plaintiffs’ petition.  On May 7, 2025, the en banc D.C. Circuit \nadministratively stayed the panel majority’s stay order and the district court’s injunction went \nback into effect.  See id. Order of May 7, 2025 [Dkt. No. 2114884]. \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 23 of 37\nconcrete setting, and [3] whether the agency’s action is sufficiently final.”  American Petroleum \nInstitute, 683 F.3d at 387.    \nThe Court finds, and the parties do not dispute, that the first and second factors \nunder the first prong are satisfied:  The questions SEF raises—whether the Department’s actions \nviolate statutory and constitutional provisions—are purely legal inquiries.  See Atlantic States \nLegal Found. v. EPA, 325 F.3d 281, 284 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (“Claims that an agency’s action is \narbitrary and capricious or contrary to law present purely legal issues.”); Beach Commc’ns, Inc. \nv. FCC, 959 F.2d 975, 986 (D.C. Cir. 1992) (holding that an equal protection claim presents a \npurely legal question).  And given the immediate harm SEF faces, see infra Section III.C, SEF’s \nclaims would not necessarily “benefit from a more concrete setting.”  See American Petroleum \nInstitute, 683 F.3d at 387.  Only the third factor under the first prong—“whether the agency’s \naction is sufficiently final”—was contested.  In their opposition, defendants argued that this \nfactor was not satisfied because SEF had an administrative appeal that was pending before the \nDepartment and, “a challenge to [an] appealed agency decision is not ripe.”  See Defs. Opp. at 9-\n10.   \nFor the reasons discussed in Section III.C, the Court concludes that the \nDepartment’s termination of SEF’s grant and SEF’s withdrawal of its administrative appeal \nsatisfy the finality factor.  Therefore, all three factors of the first ripeness prong are satisfied.6   \n \n  6  SEF argues that the second ripeness prong—hardship to the parties of withholding \ncourt consideration—weighs heavily in their favor.  See Pl. Rep. at 4.  Defendants do not contest \nthis point.  The Court finds that the direct and immediate harms alleged by SEF are sufficient to \noutweigh the institutional interest in the deferral of judicial review.  See Am. Petroleum Inst. v. \nEPA, 683 at 389 (finding that in order to outweigh the “institutional interest[ ] in the deferral of \n[judicial] review, any hardship caused by that deferral must be immediate and significant.” \n(internal quotations and citation omitted)).  With both ripeness prongs satisfied, the Court \nconcludes that SEF’s claims are ripe for judicial review.   \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 24 of 37\nIII.  SEF’S REQUEST FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \n        A.  Legal Standard \nSEF seeks a preliminary injunction under Rule 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure.  A movant seeking preliminary injunctive relief must make a “clear showing that four \nfactors, taken together, warrant relief:  likely success on the merits, likely irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, a balance of the equities in its favor, and accord with the public \ninterest.”  Archdiocese of Washington v. Wash. Metro. Area Transit Auth. (“Archdiocese of \nWashington”), 897 F.3d 314, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (quoting League of Women Voters v. \nNewby 838 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2016)); see also Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011) (noting that a preliminary injunction “may only be awarded upon a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc. (“Winter”), 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008))).  Of these, the most important factor is whether \nthe movant has established a likelihood of success on the merits.  See Aamer v. Obama, 742 \nF.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see also Bailey v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Civil Action \nNo. 24-1219 (PLF), 2024 WL 3219207, at *3 (D.D.C. June 28, 2024). \nBefore the Supreme Court’s decision in Winter, courts in this Circuit weighed \nthese four factors on a “sliding scale,” under which the movant need not “make as strong a \nshowing” on one factor if they “make[ ] an unusually strong showing” on another.  Davis v. \nPension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1291-92 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting Davenport v. \nInt’l Bhd. of Teamsters, 166 F.3d 356, 361 (D.C. Cir. 1999)); accord Damus v. Nielsen, 313 F. \nSupp. 3d 317, 326 (D.D.C. 2018).  This Circuit has suggested, however, that “a likelihood of \nsuccess” and “a likelihood of irreparable harm” are “independent, free-standing requirement[s] \nfor a preliminary injunction.”  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d at 392-93 (quoting Davis v. Pension \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 25 of 37\nBenefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d at 1296 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring)); see Archdiocese of \nWashington, 897 F.3d at 334 (declining to resolve whether the “sliding scale” approach is still \nvalid after Winter); Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Vought, Civil Action No. 25-0381 \n(ABJ), 2025 WL 942772, at *19 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, 2025).  Regardless, “a failure to show a \nlikelihood of success on the merits alone is sufficient to defeat a preliminary-injunction motion.”  \nStanding Rock Sioux Tribe v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs, 205 F. Supp. 3d 4, 26 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(citing Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass’n v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 573 F.3d 815, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2009)); \nsee also M.G.U. v. Nielsen, 325 F. Supp. 3d 111, 117-18 (D.D.C. 2018). \nFor each of its claims, SEF bears the burden of persuasion.  Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  SEF also “bears the burden of \nproducing credible evidence sufficient to demonstrate [its] entitlement to injunctive relief.”  \nWorkman v. Bissessar, 275 F. Supp. 3d 263, 267 (D.D.C. 2017).     \n \n               B.  Irreparable Harm \nWhen considering a motion for preliminary injunction, courts typically begin their \nanalyses by determining the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits.  See Archdiocese of \nWashington, 897 F.3d at 321.  In this case, however, the Court turns first to irreparable harm.   \nIn Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), the Supreme Court \ndeclared racial segregation in public education unconstitutional, and mandated its elimination \n“with all deliberate speed.”  Brown v. Bd. of Educ. of Topeka, Kan. (“Brown II”), 349 \nU.S. 294, 301 (1955).  Today, 70 years later, there are still 132 open federal school desegregation \ncases.  Pl. Mot. at Ex. 1 at 13.  An overwhelming 130 of those cases are concentrated in states \nlocated in the South.  Id.  In line with Brown’s constitutional mandate, SEF—through the \nEAC-South program—has worked tirelessly to “confront the high concentration of unresolved \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 26 of 37\nfederal school desegregation cases in the Southern region,” and deliver “targeted support to \npublic schools still struggling with the lingering effects of segregation that continue to limit \neducational opportunity for students.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 11.  At the time the Department terminated \nthe EAC-South grant, EAC-South was “actively working with several school districts, including \ndistricts under active federal desegregation orders.”  Declaration of Eshé P. Collins (“Collins \nDecl.”) [Dkt. No. 11-2] ¶¶ 6.  For example, EAC-South was assisting Fayette County Public \nSchools (“FCPS”)—a school district that has remained under a federal desegregation order since \n1965—with “ongoing desegregation initiatives” such as ensuring compliance with court-ordered \nmonitoring and reporting requirements.  Declaration of Dr. Tameka D. Lewis [Dkt. No. 11-6] ¶¶ \n5, 11.  The Department’s termination of the EAC-South grant, has left “[s]everal districts . . . \nwithout the technical assistance they had requested and have come to rely on as part of their civil \nrights compliance efforts.”  Collins Decl. ¶ 12. \nThe Department’s decision contravenes the very principle of “deliberate speed” \nmandated by Brown II.  “Brown never contemplated that the concept of ‘deliberate speed’ would \ncountenance indefinite delay in elimination of racial barriers in schools.”  Watson v. City of \nMemphis, 373 U.S. 526, 529-30 (1963).  Nor did President Eisenhower and the courageous \njudges in the South who interpreted Brown.  They could hardly have imagined that some future \nPresidential Administration would hinder efforts by organizations like SEF—based on some \nmisguided understanding of “diversity, equity, and inclusion”—to fulfill Brown’s constitutional \npromise to students across the country to eradicate the practice of racial segregation.  \nTurning to the particular harms that SEF alleges it will suffer absent immediate \ninjunctive relief:  First, SEF alleges that “[t]he Department’s abrupt termination of SEF’s EAC \ngrant has caused immediate and severe financial and operational harm.”  Pl. Mot. at 29.  \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 27 of 37\nSpecifically, “[t]he termination has deprived SEF of the sole source of funding for EAC-South,” \nhas “result[ed] in an immediate cessation of program operations and services,” and “will result in \na $1,924,031.96 annual loss to SEF, including outstanding payments of $293,681.78 for the \ncurrent EAC-South program.”  Id.; see also Am. Compl. ¶ 88.  SEF also alleges that “the \ntermination of the grant will result in $3,371,108 overall loss, including the remaining two \nbudget periods of a year each.”  Pl. Mot. at 29.  In addition to monetary losses, SEF alleges that \nthe termination of SEF’s EAC-South grant “has forced SEF to shut down EAC-South entirely,” \nresulting in “the loss of experienced staff [and] interrupt[ing] ongoing technical assistance \nprojects.”  Pl. Mot. at 29.  SEF contends that these financial and operational harms are an \n“existential threat to what SEF has built.”  Id. \nSecond, SEF alleges that the termination of its EAC grant “has inflicted serious \nand irreparable damage to SEF’s reputation and crucial relationships built over decades.”  Pl. \nMot. at 30.  According to SEF, the “sudden disruption” of EAC-South’s programming \n“jeopardizes SEF’s credibility” with the school districts that it serves because the districts “can \nno longer depend on [SEF] to provide consistent, federally authorized assistance.”  Id.  And “[i]f \nschool districts cannot rely on SEF to help them comply with desegregation orders, they may be \nless likely to engage with [SEF] on other educational equity initiatives.”  Id.7   \nDefendants respond that SEF has not proffered any evidence that its “estimated \neconomic loss would be unrecoverable,” and that SEF “operates several programs,” of which \nEAC-South is just one.  Defs. Opp. at 11.  According to defendants, “loss of experienced \n \n  7  SEF also alleges that “[t]he termination of the EAC-South grant inflicts severe \nand irreparable harm on the educational agencies and students that SEF serves,” and that “the \nharm done to SEF’s free speech rights is automatically irreparable.”  Pl. Mot. at 30, 32.  Because \nthe Court finds that SEF’s first two arguments are sufficient to demonstrate irreparable harm, the \nCourt need not reach these arguments. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 28 of 37\n[EAC-South] staff, interrupted ongoing technical assistance projects,” and other harms to \nEAC-South “say[ ] nothing about the degree of harm to [SEF], which is what is relevant.”  Id.  \nDefendants also argue that the reputational harms alleged by SEF do not “logically follow” \nwhen, as SEF believes, “the termination was unrelated to any deficiency in [SEF’s] performance \nunder the grant.”  Id. at 12.  Finally, defendants argue that SEF’s “assertion of irreparable harm \nis belied by the time it took [SEF] to seek preliminary injunctive relief,” noting that SEF filed its \nmotion sixty-nine days after its grant was terminated.  Id. at 13. \nThe Court disagrees with the defendants.  When a program’s “existence relies on \ngrant money, harm is certain once the grant funds are withdrawn.”  Climate United Fund, 2025 \nWL 1131412, at *17.  As a result of the termination of the EAC-South grant, “SEF was forced to \nhalt all EAC-South operations, suspend services to multiple school districts, and reassign staff.”  \nCollins Decl. ¶ 12.  The abrupt loss of funding has “directly impaired SEF’s ability to fulfill its \nobligations under . . . current service requests by [school] districts and state agencies,” id. ¶ 14, \nand to otherwise “fulfill its mission.”  Am. Compl. ¶ 80.  SEF now is unable to provide \nassistance to “school districts seeking to resolve federal desegregation orders.”  Id.  Without \nimmediate relief, SEF asserts that it “stands to lose specialized employees whose expertise \ncannot be easily replaced, and with them, the institutional knowledge essential to [EAC-South’s] \nwork.”  Pl. Rep. at 7.   \nTo constitute irreparable harm, SEF’s alleged injury must be “both certain and \ngreat,” “actual and not theoretical,” and “beyond remediation.”  Brennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU \nSch. of L. v. Dep’t of Com., 498 F. Supp. 3d 87, 101 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Chaplaincy of Full \nGospel Churches, 454 F.3d at 297).  While economic injuries are usually insufficient to justify \ninjunctive relief, financial harm can “constitute irreparable harm . . . where the loss threatens the \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 29 of 37\nvery existence of the movant’s business.”  Wis. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. \n1985).  And “obstacles [that] unquestionably make it more difficult for the [plaintiff] to \naccomplish [its] primary mission . . . provide injury for purposes . . . [of establishing] irreparable \nharm.”  League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d at 9.  Reputational injury can also suffice \nto establish irreparable harm.  See Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 963 F. Supp. \n1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (finding plaintiffs’ business reputation would be damaged by [agency’s] \ncharacterization of them as “enticing” senior citizens into meetings, and “pressuring” them to \nobtain reverse mortgages “under the guise of sound estate planning.”). \nThe Court finds that SEF has sufficiently demonstrated that it will suffer \nirreparable harm because the defendants’ actions threaten the livelihoods of SEF’s employees, its \nprofessional reputation, and the very existence of its programs.  See Am. Ass’n of \nColleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *23 (finding that federal grant recipients whose grants were \nterminated would suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction); Climate United Fund, 2025 \nWL 1131412, at *17 (same). \n \n    C.  Likelihood of Success on the Meritshhhhhhhh \nSEF contends that it is likely to succeed on the merits of all of its claims:  its APA \nclaims (Counts One, Two, and Three), Fifth Amendment claim (Count Four), Civil Rights Act \nclaim (Count Five), Ultra Vires claim (Count Six), and First Amendment claim (Count Seven).  \nThe Court concludes that SEF is likely to succeed on the merits of Count One—that the \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 30 of 37\nDepartment’s termination of the EAC-South grant was arbitrary and capricious.  The Court \ntherefore will grant SEF’s motion for a preliminary injunction.8 \n \n                                           1.  Finality  \nThe APA limits judicial review to “final agency action.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Agency \naction is “final” when two conditions are met: (1) “the action must mark the ‘consummation’ of \nthe agency’s decision making process—it must not be of a merely tentative or interlocutory \nnature,” and (2) “the action must be one by which ‘rights or obligations have been determined,’ \nor from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) \n(quoting Chicago & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 113 (1948), and \nPort of Boston Marine Terminal Ass’n v. Rederiaktiebolaget Transatl., 400 U.S. 62, 71 (1970)).  \nHere, the “final” agency action that SEF challenges is the Department’s termination of the \nEAC-South grant. \nThe Termination Letter represented that the Department had concluded its review \nof the EAC-South grant.  See Compl. at Ex. D. at 1 (“the Department hereby terminates grant \nNo. S004D220011 in its entirety effective 2/13/25.”).  The termination “was immediate, without \nprior notice of deficiencies or opportunity to respond.”  Pl. Mot. at 2.  The Termination Letter \nimmediately produced legal consequences for SEF because SEF could no longer access \npreviously awarded funds.  See Am. Ass’n of Colleges”), Civil Action No. 25-0702 (JRR), 2025 \nWL 833917, at *12 (finding the Department’s termination of other education-related grants \n \n  8  Although the parties briefed multiple issues, the Court need only find that SEF is \nlikely to succeed on one of its claims for this factor to weigh in their favor.  The Court therefore \ndoes not address all SEF’s arguments.  See Media Matters for Am. v. Paxton, 732 F. \nSupp. 3d 1, 27 (D.D.C. 2024), appeal dismissed, Civil Action No. 24-7059, 2025 WL 492257 \n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 13, 2025). \n \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 31 of 37\n“immediately produced legal consequences.”); see also Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of \nMgmt. & Budget, 2025 WL 368852, at *10 (finding Office of Management and Budget \nmemorandum directing federal agencies to temporarily pause disbursement of federal financial \nassistance and to freeze all such funds “immediately produced legal consequences across the \nentire federal funding system”). \nBut, perhaps most relevant, on May 12, 2025, SEF withdrew its administrative \nappeal.  See Pl. Mot. to Suppl. at Ex. A.  Then, on May 19, 2025, SEF filed an amended \ncomplaint to reflect that it had withdrawn its administrative appeal.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 1.  These \nfactual developments resolve any risk of a concurrent administrative process altering the Court’s \nanalysis or obviating judicial review.  See Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., Civil \nAction No. 23 2812 (CRC), 2024 WL 4133623, at *8 (D.D.C. Sept. 10, 2024) (emphasizing that \nwhat “matters” when determining whether a claim is incurably premature is if a “separate, still \npending [administrative] proceeding . . . might alter the court’s analysis or entirely vitiate the \nneed for judicial review.” (quoting Flat Wireless, LLC v. FCC, 944 F.3d 927, 933 (D.C. \nCir. 2019)); see also Scahill v. D.C., 909 F.3d 1177, 1184 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (explaining that \npermitting a plaintiff to cure jurisdictional defects through amended pleadings avoids “the \nunnecessary hassle and expense of filing a new lawsuit when events subsequent to filing the \noriginal complaint have fixed the jurisdictional problem.”).  The Court is satisfied that the \npurpose of the incurably premature doctrine—to prevent wasteful parallel proceedings—is no \nlonger implicated here.  The Court concludes that the Department’s termination of the EAC-\nSouth grant constituted final agency action. \n \n \n \n \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 32 of 37\n                               2.  Arbitrary and Capricious    \nSEF likely will prevail in showing that the Department’s termination of the \nEAC-South grant was arbitrary and capricious.  The APA instructs reviewing courts to hold \nunlawful and set aside final agency actions found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  When assessing \nwhether a final agency action is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” courts consider “only whether the [agency] examined ‘the relevant data’ \nand articulated ‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [its] decision, ‘including a rational connection \nbetween the facts found and the choice made.’”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New York, 588 \nU.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm \nMut. Automobile Ins. Co. (“Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn.”), 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)); see also \nFCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021) (explaining that an agency action is \n“arbitrary” and “capricious” if it is not “reasonable and reasonably explained.”); Nat’l Tel. Coop. \nAss’n v. FCC, 563 F.3d 536, 540 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (“The APA’s arbitrary-and-capricious \nstandard requires that agency rules be reasonable and reasonably explained.”).  “The scope of \nreview under the ‘arbitrary and capricious’ standard is narrow and a court is not to substitute its \njudgment for that of the agency.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 43.   \nIn determining whether the Department’s termination of the EAC-South grant was \n“reasonable and reasonably explained,” the Court looks first to the “grounds that the \n[Department] invoked” when it terminated the grant.  Michigan v. EPA, 576 \nU.S. 743, 758 (2015)); see also Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 50 (“. . . an agency’s \naction must be upheld, if at all, on the basis articulated by the agency itself.”).  The Termination \nLetter lists five theoretical bases for the grant termination, stating that SEF’s grant may have \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 33 of 37\nbeen terminated because it “promote[s] or take[s] part in DEI initiatives,” or “unlawfully \ndiscriminate[s] on the basis of” protected characteristics, or “violate[s] either the letter or \npurpose of Federal civil rights law,” or “conflict[s] with” the Department’s policies, or “[is] not \nfree from fraud, abuse, or duplication,” or “otherwise fail[s] to serve the best interests of the \nUnited States.”  Compl. at Ex. D at 2.  The Termination Letter does not identify which of these \nbases was the reason for the termination of SEF’s grant; in fact, the Termination Letter was one \nof many standardized letters that the Department sent out to several education-related grant \nrecipients.  See California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., Civil Action No. 25-10548 (MJJ), 2025 \nWL 760825, *2-3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. \nMcMahon, Civil Action No. 25-0702 (JRR), 2025 WL 833917, at *17 (D. Md. Mar. 17, 2025).   \nAs noted, the Supreme Court has held that a reasonable explanation must consider \nrelevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation for the agency’s decision, “including a \nrational connection between the facts found and the choice made.”  Dep’t of Commerce v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn., 463 U.S. at 43).  Here, “[t]he \nDepartment has not provided a satisfactory explanation of the facts found or the choice made, \nmuch less a rational connection between the two.”  Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. \nMcMahon, 2025 WL 833917, at *21.  There is no evidence in the record that the Department \nengaged in any individualized assessment of EAC-South’s programming or collected or \nconsidered any relevant data about EAC-South before terminating the grant.  And the \nDepartment’s use of a boilerplate letter that was issued to several other grant recipients further \nstrengthens SEF’s argument that there was no rational connection between the facts the \nDepartment found, if any, and the termination decision that it made. See Am. Ass’n of Colleges \nfor Tchr. Educ. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (finding that an identical termination \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 34 of 37\nletter “fail[ed] to provide Grant Recipients any workable, sensible, or meaningful reason or basis \nfor the termination of their awards.”). \nThe Court finds that the Department’s Termination Letter provides no reasoned \nexplanation for the grant termination.  In fact, the Termination Letter’s list of possible bases “is \nso broad and vague as to be limitless; devoid of import, even.”  Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. \nEduc. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 833917, at *21.  For these reasons, the Court finds that SEF has \nshown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of Count One. 9 \n \n   D. Equities and the Public Interest \nThe remaining preliminary injunction factors—the balance of the equities and \nassessment of the public interest—weigh in SEF’s favor.  These factors “merge when, as here, \nthe Government is the opposing party.’”  Singh v. Berger, 56 F.4th 88, 107 (D.C. Cir. 2022) \n(quoting Karem v. Trump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020)).  “[C]ourts must balance the \ncompeting claims of injury and must consider the effect on each party of the granting or \n \n  9  The arbitrary and capricious nature of the Department’s termination decision is \nfurther illustrated by the Termination Letter’s “appeal process.”  Despite providing no reasonable \nbasis for terminating the EAC-South grant, the Termination Letter nonetheless states that if SEF \n“wish[es] to object or challenge [the Department’s] termination decision, [SEF] must submit \ninformation and documentation supporting [its] position,” including “a brief statement of [its] \nargument and the disputed factual, legal, or other issues.”  Compl. at Ex. D at 1.  But absent an \nexplanation of what exactly it did wrong, how could SEF have mounted a meaningful \nadministrative appeal?  See Am. Ass’n of Colleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (faced with an \nidentical termination letter, the court questioned:  “[h]ow does one draft a ‘brief statement’ of a \n‘disputed’ fact when one has no earthly idea what has been asserted, if anything?”).  \n \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 35 of 37\nwithholding of the requested relief[,] . . . pay[ing] particular regard for the public consequences” \nthat would result in granting the relief sought.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24 (quotation marks omitted). \nSEF has alleged economic and non-economic injuries that would occur absent \nimmediate relief, and assert that an injunction would merely require the Department “to honor its \nexisting legal obligations until the Court can properly review the merits of this case.”  Pl. Mot. \nat 32.  SEF notes that “the Department has already appropriated and obligated funds for \n[EAC-South] through the current fiscal year, meaning no additional financial burden would be \nimposed on the government.”  Id.  Defendants counter that the Department would be “harmed by \na preliminary order to release remaining funds under the terminated grant” because it would \n“bear all the risk if the Court enters a preliminary injunction.”  Defs. Opp. at 22.  Defendants also \nassert that public interest favors allowing the Department to end support for programs that are \n“inconsistent with its interpretation of ‘the letter and purpose of’” civil rights laws.  Id. at 21.   \nDefendants’ arguments miss the mark.  Under Winter, the Court must balance \nharms that may occur if an injunction is erroneously granted as opposed to denied.  See \nWinter, 555 U.S. at 24.  Defendants assert that they bear the risk of financial loss if the Court \nerroneously enters a preliminary injunction, but offer no evidence that SEF is unable to pay back \ngrant monies released.  As for defendants’ public interest argument, any theoretical harms to \nmembers of the public who are opposed to EAC-South receiving grant funding do not outweigh \nthe alleged concrete, irreparable harm in the form of programmatic closures and loss of funding \nthat SEF has already experienced.  And to the extent defendants assert an interest in ending \nfinancial support for programs that are “inconsistent” with their interpretation of federal civil \nrights laws, the Court finds that that they likely pursued an unlawful objective in an unlawful \nmanner.  See TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. 3d 73, 85 (D.D.C. 2020) (“[T]he government \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 36 of 37\n‘cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a statute as \nrequired.’”) (quoting R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 191 (D.D.C. 2015)); see also \nLeague of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d at 12 (holding that while “[t]here is generally no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action,” “there is a substantial public \ninterest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that govern their existence \nand operation’”) (quoting Washington v. Reno, 35 F.3d 1093, 1103 (6th Cir. 1994)). \nThe Court therefore concludes that the balance of the equities and assessment of \nthe public interest weigh in favor of granting a preliminary injunction.  Each of the preliminary \ninjunction factors therefore weighs in favor of granting SEF’s motion.   \n \nIV. SECURITY \nRule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that “[t]he court may \nissue a preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order only if the movant gives security \nin an amount that the Court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party \nfound to have been wrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  FED. R. CIV. P. 65(c).  Here, defendants \nrequest that the Court require SEF “to post security in the amount of any taxpayer funds \nanticipated to be distributed during the pendency of the Court’s order.”  Defs. Opp. at 22.   \nCourts have “broad discretion” in determining “the appropriate amount of an \ninjunction bond, including the discretion to require no bond at all.”  Simms v. D.C., 872 F. \nSupp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).  As the Court \nexplained in Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Trump, requiring a significant bond “would conflict \nwith both the Court’s findings that each of the preliminary injunction factors weigh heavily in \n[SEF’s] favor and the principles of the right to seek judicial review of unlawful government \naction.”  Nat’l Treasury Emps. Union v. Trump, ––– F.Supp.3d at ––––, 2025 WL 1218044, \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01079-PLF     Document 28     Filed 05/21/25     Page 37 of 37",
