    "summary": "<p>This case challenged President Trump&rsquo;s and the U.S. DOGE Service&rsquo;s dismantling of the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), a congressionally chartered nonprofit organization created to promote global conflict resolution. On April 10, 2025, a group of former USIP employees, contractors, and a donor filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on April 14. They named the U.S. DOGE Service, President Trump, the USIP, the General Services Administration (GSA), and several senior officials as defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell.</p>\r\n<p>Represented by Emery Celli Brinckerhoff Abady Ward &amp; Maazel and Ali &amp; Lockwood LLP, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and constitutional separation of powers doctrines. They alleged that the President and executive officials lacked legal authority to dismiss USIP&rsquo;s board, terminate hundreds of employees and contracts, seize USIP's building, and publicly disclose information that endangered personnel abroad. They claimed these actions exceeded statutory authority, violated Congress&rsquo;s intent to preserve USIP&rsquo;s independence, and were arbitrary and capricious under the APA.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) to halt the dismantling of USIP and reinstate employees. On April 22, Judge Howell held an emergency hearing. While expressing concern about the safety risks to overseas personnel, the court denied the TRO, finding the requested relief too broad at that early stage. The court instead ordered expedited discovery, including depositions of several high-level officials.</p>\r\n<p>This case is related to <a href=\"../../../../case/46245/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>U.S. Institute of Peace v. Jackson</em></a>, also before Judge Howell, in which the official USIP board challenged its ouster. On May 19, the court granted summary judgment (SJ) for the board in Jackson, ruling that the President&rsquo;s removal of USIP directors was unlawful and voided all acts by the replacement leadership. That ruling was appealed, and the D.C. Circuit granted the government&rsquo;s motion to stay the Jackson judgment pending appeal.</p>\r\n<p>On June 5, Judge Howell granted a joint motion to stay proceedings in Pippenger pending further developments in Jackson. The stay was automatically lifted on June 27 when the D.C. Circuit stayed the Jackson judgment, but both parties then jointly moved to reinstate and modify the stay. On July 7, the court approved a new stay structure. The stay will now remain in place until either (1) the D.C. Circuit denies en banc rehearing in Jackson or the Supreme Court grants a stay, or (2) the Jackson judgment is modified or vacated. The plaintiffs may also lift the stay at any time with two weeks&rsquo; notice.</p>\r\n<p>If the stay is lifted, deadlines will resume on the pending discovery motion and the government&rsquo;s response to the amended complaint. The court ordered the parties to file joint status reports every 60 days. The case remains ongoing.</p>",

The  United  States  Institute  of  Peace  (“USIP”)  is  an  independent  non-profit \norganization based in Washington, D.C. that has a purpose of “promot[ing] international peace \nand the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to \nviolence.” USIP  was  created  via  an  Act  of  Congress  and  organized  under  the  non-profit \ncorporation laws of the District of Columbia. Until March 2025, USIP owned its own $500 million \nheadquarters building in Washington, D.C. and maintained an annual budget of roughly $55 \nmillion of Congressionally appropriated funds that it used to develop training and education in the \npeacebuilding field and resolve violent conflict around the world. \n2.  On March 14, 2025, that all changed. In a bizarre series of events that are anathema \nto how the United States government relates to American civil society, federal government \nagencies—the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (“OPM”)  and  the  General  Services \nAdministration (GSA”), the United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”), and the other federal \ngovernment Defendants in this case broke into USIP’s headquarters using agents from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and a leftover skeleton key held by USIP’s former security \ncontractor, fired USIP’s independent Board of Directors in violation of their statutory removal \nprotections, usurped USIP’s Board, and arrested USIP’s functioning. Defendants transferred \nUSIP’s $500 million building to GSA for no consideration, drained the Endowment of USIP—\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 4 of 37\nanother independent, legal entity organized under the laws of the District of Columbia—and fired \nalmost all of its employees and contractors, including those working in active warzones abroad.  \n3.  Plaintiffs in this case—former USIP employees suffering ongoing irreparable harm, \na  current  USIP  Personal  Services  Contractor  (“PSC”)  representing  USIP  in  Libya  without \nprotection from USIP’s security apparatus, which has been dismantled; a USIP programming \npartner dedicated to engaging youth in Russia and Ukraine in peace dialogues; USIP vendors who \nare owed funds from USIP for work that they have performed under lawful contract but have not \nbeen paid; and a donor to the Endowment for the USIP, which has been raided by Defendants—\nask this Court to stop the bloodletting of USIP and the Endowment for USIP—by issuing a \ntemporary restraining order, enjoining further illegal activities by Defendants, including the now \nco-opted  USIP  itself,  and  vitiating  the  irreparable,  collateral  consequences  of  Defendants’ \nunlawful actions that have no other remedy at law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion) and 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (action to redress deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution \nof the United States). \n5.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1).  A \nsubstantial part of the events giving rise to the claims herein occurred in this District, Defendants \nare agencies and officers of the United States sued in their official capacities or independent \nentities based and/or registered in Washington, D.C., and Plaintiffs Elizabeth Quinlan, Chris \nBosley, Jane Doe, and Chester A. Crocker reside in this District. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 5 of 37\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n \n6.

Defendant Trent Morse is the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel in the  \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office, the White House Office, and the Executive Office of  \nthe President of the United States. \n29.  Defendant  United  States  Institute  of  Peace  is  an  independent,  non-profit \ncorporation created by Congress in 1984 that has been co-opted, as of March 14, 2025, by the other \nDefendants as alleged in this Complaint. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 8 of 37\n30.  Defendant Endowment of the United States Institute for Peace is a 501(c)(3) \nnonprofit organization registered in Washington, D.C. that was mandated by Congress and created \nby USIP to support USIP’s fulfilling its Congressional mandate.  \n31.  For the purpose of this Complaint, all references to “DOGE” are inclusive of DOGE \nTO, OPM, GSA, and DOS to the extent acting in concert. \nJURY DEMAND \n \n32.  Plaintiffs hereby demand a jury trial as to all matters properly triable by jury. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nStructure, Powers, and Functions of USIP \n \n33.  USIP is an independent nonprofit corporation created by Congress in 1984 via the \nUnited  States  Institute  of  Peace  Act  (“USIP  Act”)  to  promote  peaceful  conflict  resolution \nworldwide. 22 U.S.C. § 4601, et seq. \n34.  The purpose of USIP is to  \nserve the people and the Government through the widest possible \nrange  of  education  and  training,  basic  and  applied  research \nopportunities,  and  peace  information  services  on  the  means  to \npromote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among \nthe nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence. \n \nId. § 4601(b). \n \n35.  Prior to the unlawful conduct at issue here, USIP employed roughly 300 employees \nwith an annual operating budget of roughly $55 million through Congressional appropriations, and \ncontracted with PSCs and vendors around the world in furtherance of its global mission. \n36.  USIP acts through a Board of Directors (the “Board”) to advance the purpose of the \nUSIP through a variety of discretionary activities directed by the Board, such as supporting \nscholarly  inquiry  on  international  peace  and  conflict  resolution,  developing  publications, \nestablishing a clearinghouse for storing information from the field of peace learning, and creating \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 9 of 37\none or more legal entities organized under the laws of the District of Columbia to support its \npurposes.  \n37.  The powers and duties of USIP are, to the extent consistent with the USIP Act, “the \npowers conferred upon a nonprofit corporation by the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation \nAct,” Pub. L. No. 87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962), with the exception of section 5(o) of \nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act. \n38.  Because USIP does not have the power conferred under section 5(o) of that Act, \nUSIP cannot, on its own or through its officers, “cease its corporate activities” or dissolve itself. \n39.  In 2020, Congress passed the “Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act” in \nwhich USIP is obligated to create and maintain “a professional development training initiative.” \nCongress mandated that: “The president and chief executive officer of the United States Institute \nof Peace shall create a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution tools \nbased on the principles of nonviolence.”  \n40.  Congress enumerated four statutorily mandated activities of the Academy, and \nexpressly prohibited USIP from contracting out this work to other entities.  \n41.  The USIP Act makes clear that USIP is a non-governmental entity.  \n42.  USIP also functions as a non-governmental entity. For example, USIP:  \na.  Maintains (or at least maintained) a “.org” domain and not “.gov” for its official \nwebsite. \nb.  Has independent discretion as to whether it responds to “the request of a \ndepartment or agency of the United States Government to examine, study, and \nreport on any issue [], 22 U.S.C. § 4604(e); \nc.  Has independent discretion to enter into personal services and other contracts, \n22 U.S.C. § 4604(f); \nd.  Is authorized by law to direct unobligated appropriated funds to its Endowment \nand spend them “without regard to fiscal year limitations, 22 U.S.C. § 4609(b); \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 10 of 37\ne.  Maintains its own private auditor, 22 U.S.C. § 4607; \nf.  May sue and be sued, 22 U.S.C. § 4604(k); \ng.  Has power over its land;1 \nh.  Built its own Washington, D.C. headquarters building, a $500 million asset, \nwith privately raised funds; \ni.  Pays its employees via a private payroll provider; \nj.  Maintains its own procurement, grant, and contracting policies that are distinct \nfrom the uniform federal policies applicable to the Executive Branch; \nk.  Does not use Office of Personnel Management forms to mark personnel actions \nbecause its employees are not employed by the federal government; and \nl.  Does not offer its employees any of the suite of benefits associated with \nemployment in federal agencies, such as the Federal Employee Health Benefits, \nFederal Employee Retirement System, Thrift Savings Program, and federal \ntravel benefits (such as the General Services Administration City Pair Program \nnegotiated airfares). \n43.  However,  USIP  is  subject  to  FOIA,  has  grant-making  authority  with  public \nfunds, 22  U.S.C.  §§  4603(c),  4604(b)(1),  (d),  4606(b);  is  tasked  with  making  reports  to \nCongress, id. § 4604(c)(3); may obtain services from the General Services Administration, id. § \n4604(o), receives annual Congressional appropriations, and may access classified materials. 22 \nU.S.C. § 4603 (e).  \n44.  That Congress expressly enumerated these functions and powers distinguishes \nUSIP from other federal agencies, for which these functions and powers are assumed and \ntherefore not enumerated. \n \n1 Pub. L. 104-201 § 2831 (giving the Institute administrative jurisdiction—effectively a permanent rent-free tenancy—\nover three acres); Pub. L. 109-364 § 2842 (giving the Institute administrative jurisdiction over an additional acre, \nincluding two buildings that were subsequently renovated and renamed the Bush and Clinton Buildings). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 11 of 37\nThe USIP Board of Directors \n \n45.  USIP has a 15-member bipartisan Board of Directors. By statute, not more than \neight members of the Board may be from the same political party. 22 U.S.C. § 4605(c). \n46.  Twelve members of the Board are appointed to the Board by the President of the \nUnited States following confirmation by the United States Senate. See 22 U.S.C. § 4605(b)(4). \nNone of these 12 Board members can simultaneously serve as Government officials, and all must \nhave commensurate practical or academic experience in peace and conflict resolution efforts. Id. \n§ 4605(b), (d).  \n47.  Three Board members are ex officio members: the Secretary of State, Secretary of \nDefense, and the president of the National Defense University—or their United States Senate-\nconfirmed designee. Each ex officio member of the Board serves in their role at the pleasure of the \nPresident. \n48.  One member of the non-ex officio Board members is elected by the other non-ex \nofficio members to serve a three-year term as Chairman of the Board.  \n49.  The Board may appoint a president of USIP, who is to oversee the day-to-day \nadministration of the affairs of USIP and serve as a non-voting ex officio member of the Board. \nBoard Member Removal \n \n50.  The 12 non-ex officio Board members can only be removed from their positions in \none of three ways. See 22 U.S.C. § 4605 (b), (d), (f) \n51.  First, the President may remove them “in consultation with the Board, for conviction \nof a felony, malfeasance in office, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to discharge duties.” \n52.  Second, “the President may remove them upon the recommendation of eight voting \nmembers of the Board . . . pursuant to action taken at a meeting of the Board.” \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 12 of 37\n53.  Third, they may be removed “upon the recommendation of a majority of the \nmembers of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Education and Labor of the \nHouse of Representatives and a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nand the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.” \nThe United States DOGE Service \n54.  After assuming office on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder  14158  entitled  “Establishing  and  Implementing  the  President’s  ‘Department  of \nGovernment Efficiency,’” (the “DOGE EO”). Section one of the DOGE EO states that its purpose \nis to “establish[] the Department of Government Efficiency to implement the President’s DOGE \nAgenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency \nand productivity.”  \n55.  The DOGE EO further establishes an Administrator reporting to the White House \nChief of Staff, and establishes the “U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization,” (“DOGE \nTO”) headed by the Administrator. DOGE EO, Section 3(b). \n56.  On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210 that lays out \nDOGE’s role in “eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity” and its mandate to work with agency \nheads to create and implement hiring plans, including anointing DOGE with the power to decide \nwhich vacancies should be filled. The DOGE TO Administrator is obligated to “submit a report \nto the President regarding implementation of this order, including a recommendation as to \nwhether any of its provisions should be extended, modified, or terminated.” \n57.  The  White  House  publicly  announced  that  Amy  Gleason  is  the  Acting \nAdministrator of DOGE and/or DOGE TO.2 \n \n2 https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/25/politics/amy-gleason-doge-acting-administrator/index.html. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 13 of 37\n58.  As of February 19, 2025, DOGE had at least 34 employees, of which 20 are listed \nas being at the Executive Office of the President and the remaining 14 staffers are listed as \nworking at various federal agencies.3  \n59.  Defendant  Nate  Cavanaugh—a  28-year-old  tech  entrepreneur  with  no  prior \ngovernment service and no experience in the field of peacebuilding, and the purported current \npresident of USIP—has been widely reported to be employed by and working at the behest of \nGSA, OPM, and DOGE.4   \n60.  DOGE has an operating budget of $14.4 million.5 DOGE has established a website \nwith a .gov URL (https://doge.gov/) that includes the header “An official website of the United \nStates government” and an X account (@DOGE)), both of which are used to promote its work, \nfindings, and actions, such as cancelling contracts and grants.  \nDOGE Has a Track Record of Attempting to Shutter Governmental and Non-Governmental \nAgencies and Institutions in Violation of Law \n \n61.  In implementing President Trump’s Executive Orders pertaining to the size of the \nfederal  government,  DOGE—facilitated  by  OPM  and  GSA—has  begun  systematically \ndismantling and dissolving governmental and non-governmental agencies and institutions that \nreceive public funds.  \n62.  According  to  public  reporting,  DOGE  is  “exercising  significant  authority  by \ndirecting agencies to implement various policies, superintending personnel decisions purporting \nto close federal agencies, acquiring access to sensitive databases, and threatening agency officials \nwho fail to comply.”6 \n \n3 ProPublica, Update 11, 2025, https://projects.propublica.org/elon-musk-doge-tracker/. \n4 See, e.g., https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/interactive/2025/doge-employees-list-staff-elon-musk/. \n5 See, e.g., https://fortune.com/2025/02/12/elon-musk-doge-doubles-budget-government-spending-cuts/. \n6  “Challenging  DOGE,”  Governing  for  Impact,  Feb.  2025,  https://governingforimpact.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/02/Challenging-DOGEPrimer-final.pdf. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 14 of 37\n63.  In the span of one month, for example, DOGE took over the Office of Personnel \nManagement,7 contributed to a humanitarian crisis and the loss of 50,000 jobs by unlawfully \nattempting  to  shutter  the  Congressionally-authorized  U.S.  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and touted its success in cancelling $1 billion in contracts across 25 agencies and \ncutting $900 million in education funding.8 \n64.  On February 19, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14217. The stated \npurpose of the Executive Order is to “reduce the size of the Federal Government,” with “a \nreduction in the elements . . . that the President has determined are unnecessary.” The Executive \nOrder lists federal entities that “shall be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with \napplicable law, and such entities shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and \nassociated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.”  \n65.  The Executive Order names the Institute as one of the entities purportedly covered \nby the order. Other listed entities included the Inter-American Foundation (“IAF”) and the U.S. \nAfrican Development Foundation (“USADF”). \n66.  On March 4, 2025, DOGE announced that it had reduced IAF, an entity with a $60 \nmillion operating budget, to its statutory minimum: one employee.9 \n \n7 Will Steakin & Laura Romero, OPM, implementing Musk's DOGE plans, sends federal workers 2nd 'Fork in the \nRoad' email, ABC News (Feb. 3, 2025), https://abcnews.go.com/US/opm-implementing-musks-doge-plans-sends-\nfederalworkers/story?id=118401375; Chas Danner, All the Federal Agencies DOGE Has Gotten Access To, NY Mag. \n(Feb. 10, 2025), https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/doge-elon-musk-whatfederal-agencies-access-lawsuits.html. \n8 Charles Creitz, DOGE announces more than $1B in savings after canceling 104 federal DEI contracts, FOX News \n(Jan.  31,  2025),  https://www.foxnews.com/politics/doge-announces-morethan-1b-savings-after-canceling-104-\nfederal-dei-contracts; Savings, Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, https://www.doge.gov/savings (last visited Feb. 19, 2025); \nZach Montague & Dana Goldstein, Musk Team Announces Millions in Cuts to Education Dept.

On February 20, the day after issuance of EO 14217, a representative of DOGE \ncontacted USIP. On February 24, Ambassador George Moose, acting president of USIP, and \nUSIP’s outside counsel, met virtually with DOGE representatives, including Defendant Nate \nCavanaugh. \n68.  The  DOGE  representatives  erroneously  asserted  that  the  only  statutory \nrequirements of USIP are the existence of its Board, the appointment of a president, the payment \nof incidental expenses for the Board, and the submission of certain reports to Congress and the \nExecutive Branch. \n69.  As of March 14, 2025, USIP’s Board of Directors had 14 members: the three ex \nofficio members under 22 U.S.C. § 4605(b)(1)-(3), and 11 members who had been appointed with \nthe advice and consent of the Senate pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4605(b)(4).  \n70.  On  or  about  March  14,  2025,  Defendant  Trent  Morse  of  the  White  House \nPresidential Personnel Office purported to fire, via email—under the authority of Defendant \nPresident Donald J. Trump—all 11 members of the Board of Directors other than the three serving \nex officio.  \n71.  The termination emails did not state any justification and violated the removal \nprotections afforded to Board members under the USIP Act. \n72.  Because members of the Board were unlawfully removed by the President, all \nsubsequent actions by the remaining ex officio members and Defendant Cavanaugh are ultra vires \nand void ab initio, including all employment terminations, contract cancellations, and the cessation \nof services. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 16 of 37\n73.  Following this unlawful removal, only three Board members remained: Defendants \nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and President of the National \nDefense University Peter Garvin—all of whom possess their Board seats via service in other \npositions in the federal government at the pleasure of the President. \n74.  Also on March 14, 2025, representatives from GSA and/or DOGE and Defendant \nKenneth Jackson appeared at USIP headquarters building requesting access. USIP representatives \ndenied them entry. \n75.  Later  that  same  evening,  Defendants  Cavanaugh  and  other  DOGE  personnel \nreturned to USIP headquarters accompanied by FBI Special Agents and presented George Foote, \ncounsel to USIP, with a “resolution” signed by the three ex officio members of the Board purporting \nto remove George Moose from his position as acting president of USIP.  \n76.  On March 17, 2025, at approximately 2:30 p.m., four employees of Inter-Con \nSecurity  Systems  Inc.  (“Inter-Con”),  USIP’s  former  security  contractor,  arrived  at  USIP \nheadquarters at the behest of DOGE and/or DOGE TO.  \n77.  Inter-Con had been told by GSA and/or DOGE employees that every federal \ncontract Inter-Con held would be cancelled if they did not let Defendant Jackson into the building. \n78.  Inter-Con employees were unable to enter the building because their badges had \nbeen deactivated upon suspension of USIP’s contract with Inter-Con. \n79.  Upon their failed entry, another Inter-Con employee arrived with a physical key \nthat USIP had not yet confiscated, and used this key to enter USIP headquarters and let other Inter-\nCon employees in.  \n80.  After entering the headquarters building, the Inter-Con employees were advised by \nUSIP staff on-site that they were trespassing. Nevertheless, they continued toward USIP’s gun \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 17 of 37\nsafe, at which point Mr. Foote contacted the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department \n(“the MPD”) to report the unlawful intrusion.  \n81.  When MPD officers arrived, they forcibly entered the building, allowing DOGE \nand DOGE TO employees to gain unlawful access and begin expelling everyone from the building, \nincluding acting president Moose, USIP staff, and outside counsel Mr. Foote.  \n82.  That same day, Anna Kelly, Deputy White House Press Secretary, posted on X in \nresponse to a different message on X with a purported quote from George Moose, president and \nCEO of USIP that “DOGE has broken into our building”: \n \n  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 18 of 37\n83.  Accompanying Ms. Kelly’s message was an image of the undated purported \n“resolution” of the Rubio-Hegseth-Garvin Board of Directors to terminate Moose and appoint \nDefendant Jackson. At the time, Defendant Jackson also held a position at USAID where he was \nleading DOGE’s efforts to dismantle the agency. \n84.  On or about March 18, 2025, DOGE and/or DOGE TO employees started physical \ndestruction of the USIP building, including tearing the USIP seal off the wall and breaking it into \npieces, and shredding hard copy documents. \n85.  The same day, USIP employees learned that DOGE employees could access all \nsystems, computers, and phones.  \n86.  Later that day, some USIP employees were alerted that DOGE representatives were \nsending email messages from USIP email addresses to contractors and program partners on behalf \nof USIP program staff. \n87.  When USIP staff lost access to their accounts, they simultaneously lost access to a \nvirtual private network that allowed staff to connect to USIP’s financial management system, and \nthereby their ability to conduct business on behalf of USIP, including paying invoices submitted \nby USIP contractors. \n88.  Around this time, USIP had roughly 792 open contracts, orders, or task orders, with \ntotal obligations of approximately $65.7 million. These contractors were located in over 63 \ncountries. As of March 21, 2025, USIP had issued roughly 56 advances that combined equaled \n$1,482,535.57.  \n89.  On March 19, 2024, Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary, responded to \na question asked during a White House press conference about DOGE’s forced entry into USIP’s \nheadquarters. She responded as follows: \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 19 of 37\nWe were made aware of this story by individuals at DOGE, Elon \nMusk’s team, and also at the State Department, who were unable to \naccess this building. [And it] became very clear that there was a \nconcerted effort among the rogue bureaucrats at the United States \nInstitute of Peace to actually physically barricade themselves, essentially, \ninside of the building to prevent political appointees of this \nadministration, who work at the direction of the President of the United \nStates, to get into the building.10 \n \n90.  On Friday, March 21, all USIP employees were instructed via personal email and/or \nmessaging applications to personal phones to submit their timesheets for the pay period no later \nthan 5:00 p.m. \n91.  On or about March 25, 2025, a document containing a list of all employees and \nPSCs working in country offices, including personally identifiable information, was circulated to \nthe unsecured personal email addresses of 12 USIP staff members, including country directors and \ntheir respective center vice presidents. \n92.  Several  of  the  staff  members  whose  personally  identifiable  information  was \ndisclosed in this document are from, live, or work in countries where they would be at risk of \nphysical harm, including arbitrary arrest, detention, and/or torture, for being associated with the \nUSIP. These  staff were directed to identify a  location to which they could safely relocate \nthemselves by April 9, 2025. Employees and PSCs working in country offices were directed to \nsubmit their relocation plans two days later, by Thursday, March 27, 2025. \n93.  Later that same day, Justin Fox, a GSA employee deployed by and through the \nunlawful authority of DOGE, sent an email indicating that all staff should begin taking operational \nsteps to close offices and programs, including ending of and residential leases, and “should operate \nunder the assumption that any program exclusive to USIP will begin wind-down on April 9th.” \n \n10 https://youtu.be/VzN1ViRNaX4 (emphasis added).  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 20 of 37\n94.  On or about March 21, 2025, Defendant Jackson purported to fire at least six USIP \nemployees, all of whom had been present at headquarters and involved in preventing DOGE’s \nentry into the building on both March 14 and March 17. \n95.  On or about March 25, by a resolution of two of the three ex officio Board members, \nMr. Jackson ended his purported position as acting president of USIP and Nate Cavanaugh was \nnamed in his stead. \n96.  Two of the three ex officio Board members, Defendants Rubio and Hegseth, also \nsigned a resolution removing Endowment officers and instructing the newly appointed head to \ntransfer all Endowment assets to USIP.  \n97.  Following his appointment as acting president of USIP, Defendant Cavanaugh sent \na letter to GSA requesting that GSA “accept transfer of excess property[,]” USIP’s headquarters—\na $500 million building that USIP, and USIP alone, had built with private donations and owned—\nfor less than the property’s fair market value. \n98.  Defendant  Cavanaugh  also  communicated  that  USIP  would  be  “capable”  of \nadvanc[ing] the history, science, art, and practice of international peace and the resolution of \nconflicts among nations without the use of violence” without the ownership of a large and \nexpensive building. 22 U.S.C. § 4601(a)(9). He also stated that USIP’s obligations still included \nthose set forth in § 4604(b)(1)-(10). \n99.  Prior to Defendant Cavanaugh’s unauthorized and unlawful transfer of the building, \nthe Endowment had been the lawful owner of USIP’s headquarters building, which was built by \nprivate contractors engaged by USIP and paid for by a combination of special appropriations and \nprivate gifts, as authorized by 22 U.S.C. § 4604(h)(3)(A). \n \n \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 21 of 37\nMass-Firings Begin on March 28, 2025 \n \n100.  Beginning around 9:00 pm on Friday, March 28, 2025, Plaintiffs and other USIP \nemployees began receiving termination letters via their personal email addresses.  \n101.  The termination emails stated: “This letter is to inform you of a change in your \nemployment status with United State [sic] Institute of Peace. Effective March 28, 2025, your \nemployment with us will conclude. We understand that this is a significant change, and we are \ncommitted to supporting you through the offboarding process. Please see the attached USIP Staff \nExit Checklist and send your signed agreement to HumanResources@usip.org.” \n102.  Attached to each email was a document titled, “Separation Agreement and Release \nof Claims” dated March 28, 2025 (“the Letter”). The Letter was sent, unsigned, by Mirna Rivas as \n“Acting President of Human Resources.”  \n103.  The Letter stated that employees were terminated from their positions “[at] the \ndirection of the President of the United States Institute of Peace” and that employees would receive \non or around April 11, 2025 all unpaid wages and accrued, unused annual leave. Additionally, \nemployee healthcare benefits would end on March 31, 2025, less than one business day after notice \nof termination, with the option to continue benefits at the employee’s expense pursuant to the \nConsolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”). \n104.  No mention was made as to the impact of termination on other USIP benefits, such \nas flexible spending accounts, health spending accounts, or retirement accounts. \n105.  No date was provided for returning the signed Letter, except for those employees \naged 40 or older who were asked to return the letter within 21 days, thereby releasing their right \nto an additional 24 days of review pursuant to the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act in the \nevent of a group layoff. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 22 of 37\n106.  By midnight on March 28, at least 265 USIP employees had been terminated. \n107.  This included all 33 employees of the Gandhi-King Global Academy (“GKGA”), \nas well as almost all contracting staff and others responsible for essential programming functions \nand oversight. Additional PSCs affiliated with the GKGA were terminated on March 31, 2025. \n108.  On or about midnight, March 28, 2025, USIP employees received their paychecks \nfor work performed under the previous pay period starting March 9, 2025, and ending March 22, \n2025. \nDOGE Defendants Continue to Dissolve All USIP Programs and Funding  \n \n109.  On March 29, 2025, hours after the now co-opted, DOGE-Rubio-Hegseth-Garvin-\nCavanaugh-controlled USIP terminated the employment of hundreds of USIP employees, Anna \nKelly, Deputy White House Press Secretary, told CBS News via written statement: \nTaxpayers don’t want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-\nfunded “research institute” that has failed to deliver peace. President \nTrump ended the era of forever wars and established peace in his \nfirst term, and he is carrying out his mandate to eliminate bloat and \nsave taxpayer dollars.11 \n110.  On March 31, 2025, the official DOGE X account posted: \n \n \n11 https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-institute-of-peace-staff-termination-notices/. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 23 of 37\n111.  Contrary to Defendant DOGE’s suggestion that USIP’s actions were improper, \nUSIP is authorized to move Congressionally appropriated funds to the Endowment at the end of \nevery fiscal year pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4609(b). \n112.  The March 31 DOGE message also posted a list of four USIP contracts that had \npurportedly been cancelled, including one that identified a former member of the Taliban who was \nworking  to  advance  USIP’s  peacebuilding  efforts  in  Afghanistan.  Public  disclosure  of  this \ninformation has exposed this contractor to the world as working for USIP and led to death threats \nagainst him and his family has been harassed within Afghanistan.  \n113.  On April 1, 2025, the official DOGE X account posted, in reference to the March \n31, 2025 USIP X message: “Update: the $13M in taxpayer dollars has been returned to the \nTreasury.”12 \n \n \n \n114.  Defendant DOGE, and DOGE-co-opted Defendant USIP, have made clear the \nintent to shutter USIP permanently, leaving USIP unable to implement any of its programs or \nstatutorily mandated functions. \n \n12 https://x.com/DOGE/status/1907229152073199840. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 24 of 37\n115.  Since  GSA/DOGE  employee  Justin  Fox  first  informed  field  staff  that  all \nprogramming would be closing down on April 9, DOGE has continued to communicate further \nwind-downs through the end of May.  \n116.  Summary  and  surprise  termination  of  all  of  USIP  contracting  staff  makes  it \nimpossible for USIP to conduct thorough and proper reconciliation between these advances and \nthe deliverables received to ensure taxpayers funds were spent properly. \n117.  On March 18, DOGE terminated USIP’s access to the international payment \nmodality of the Department of Treasury International Treasury Service and terminated USIP’s \nability to transfer funds from the U.S. Treasury to its bank account. \n118.  On March 20, Defendant Cavanaugh directed then-CFO Catherine Dale to make \nDefendant Jackson the sole signatory of the Endowment’s bank accounts. \n119.  On March 24, Defendant Jackson denied then-CFO Catherine Dale from requesting \nto apportion USIP’s appropriated funds from the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year \n2025. \n120.  On March 24, Defendant Jackson also denied then-CFO Catherine Dale’s request \nto restore employee access to transfer payroll funds. \nPlaintiffs Will Suffer Immediate and Irreparable Harm Due to Defendants’ Violations of Law \n \n121.  Plaintiff Sasha Pippenger was the Director of Peace Processes at USIP until her \nemployment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Plaintiff Pippenger has been diagnosed with \nankylosing spondylitis, a serious and incurable autoimmune disease that requires a costly drug \ninfusion treatment every six weeks without lapses.  \n122.  Plaintiff Quinlan served as the Program Officer for Public Engagement and D.C. \nPartnerships at USIP until her employment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Plaintiff Quinlan \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 25 of 37\nhas been diagnosed with a Chiari I malformation in her brain, which, if left untreated, can result \nin permanent neurological damage.  \n123.  Plaintiffs Pippenger and Quinlan, along with other former employees and their \nfamilies who have relied on USIP health insurance, are at imminent risk of dire, long-term health \nconsequences as a result of the Defendants’ abrupt termination of health insurance and complete \nlack of communication regarding alternatives. Defendants’ unlawful conduct has caused Ms. \nQuinlan to forego critical and urgent medical testing and treatment, which she will continue to \nhave to forego absent reinstatement and return of her health insurance coverage. \n124.  Plaintiff  Bosley  was  the  Acting  Director  for  the  Program  on  Violence  and \nExtremism at USIP until his employment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Mr. Bosley relied \non existing USIP policies & practices related to termination and severance when deciding to start \nthe process of having a baby with his spouse via surrogacy. Having been abruptly terminated with \nno notice or severance, he cannot be sure of his ability to move forward with surrogacy. \n125.  Defendants DOGE and DOGE-co-opted Defendant USIP, have taken significant \nsteps towards permanently dissolving USIP, and as a result, Plaintiffs Pippenger, Quinlan, and \nBosley, and all other terminated employees, will lose the ability to participate in USIP’s COBRA \nhealth insurance coverage. \n126.  Plaintiff Jane Doe’s employment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Ms. Doe is a \nColombian citizen with an H1B1 visa, who relied on her visa status to lawfully work at USIP and \nremain in the United States with her baby and husband. This visa, which will expire within 60 days \nof the end of Ms. Doe’s employment at USIP, and not only will she be forced to leave the country, \nbut her husband will also lose his visa status. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 26 of 37\n127.  Plaintiff John Doe is a Libyan national residing in Tripoli, Libya who is currently \nemployed by USIP as a PSC. John Doe faces imminent and irreparable harms should his contract \nbe abruptly terminated or his name publicized, as DOGE has done for another USIP contractor. \nJohn Doe has already lost access to security protections—DOGE had cancelled the security \nservices team contract. The imminent termination of his contract will expose him to additional \npersonal risk, leaving John Doe and his family vulnerable to targeting and retaliation, including \ndeath threats.  \n128.  Plaintiff Brave Generation, a non-profit entity that partners with USIP’s Center for \nRussia  and  Europe  on  dialogues,  trusted  USIP  and  its  employees  to  maintain  secure  and \nconfidential data management protocols. Brave Generation participants and their families in \nUkraine and Russia could face serious, irreparable harms should their participation in peace \ndialogues be disclosed, which is imminently likely due to DOGE’s seizure of communications and \ndata at USIP—DOGE has already leaked confidential information about grantees and continues to \ndo so. \n129.  Plaintiff Crocker is a donor to the Endowment of USIP, who specifically pledged \nmoney to USIP for supporting a permanent named conference room at USIP headquarters and \npeacebuilding activities on campus. His donation has now been co-opted by DOGE and the \nDOGE-Rubio-Hegseth-Cavanaugh-controlled  USIP  and  Endowment  for  USIP,  and  his \ncontributions have not been used consistent with the lawful purposes of such donations. This co-\noption is contrary to his intent and the conditions of his donations, and he fears that the impact of \nhis  donation—supporting  USIP’s  mission—will  be  permanently  lost  if  DOGE  continues  to \ntransfer assets from the Endowment. He suffers reputational harm from Defendants’ ongoing, \nbaseless maligning of USIP. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 27 of 37\n130.  Plaintiffs InterMotion, LLC and Peace in Praxis, LLC, both contractors of USIP, \nare owed money by USIP for work done pursuant to lawful contract, and, despite their best efforts, \nhave been unable to collect. If USIP is shuttered, they will lose the ability to obtain recompense \nfor work already performed. USIP’s breach of contract and failure to provide required notice of \ncancellation of contract also poses imminent reputational and business harms to USIP contractors, \nmany of whom are small businesses and are unable to pay subcontractors. \n131.  Plaintiff Shira Lowinger was the Director of Grants Administration in the Office of \nFinance at USIP until her employment was terminated on March 28, 2025, and attests to the serious \nand myriad harms caused by the abrupt cancellation of hundreds of USIP contracts around the \nworld, including in active warzones. The abrupt decision to terminate the majority of USIP \nemployees and contractors, and to cancel contracts without notice or final payment, is extremely \nharmful to USIP and its personnel, and has resulted in irreparable consequences for USIP’s \noperations,  legal  protections,  and  the  safety  and  financial  security  of  USIP’s  employees, \ncontractors, and research subjects. \n132.  If USIP is shuttered, Plaintiffs Pippenger, Quinlan, Bosley, Lowinger, and others, \nwill have no other remedy at law for redress of Defendants’ illegal actions that caused termination \nof their employment.  \n133.  All  Plaintiffs  who  are  currently  employed  by  or  have  been  terminated  by \nDefendants suffer the reputational harm of being baselessly maligned by Defendants on X and in \nthe media as “rogue” and wasteful bureaucrats defying the United States Government and the \ntaxpayer’s expense.  \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 28 of 37\n134.  Further delay in reinstating terminated employees and PSCs will irreparably harm \nthem—they have been left without income and many will be forced to seek other employment to \nmake up for this loss.  \n135.  The  Defendants’  actions  will  also  prevent  any  possibility  that  USIP  as  an \nindependent entity can survive—employee-Plaintiffs and others similarly situated are skilled \nprofessionals with decades of experience carrying out USIP’s mission. They cannot, without \nincome and attendant benefits, wait for litigation to play out for years while Defendants have \nclearly shown they are capable of dissolve USIP in a matter of weeks. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires Action in Violation of 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f) and U.S. Const. Art II, § 3 \n(Against Defendants President Donald J. Trump and \nTrent Morse their his official capacities) \n \n136.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference all paragraphs above as \nif fully set forth here. \n137.  Under the USIP Act, Congress established USIP as an independent nonprofit \ncorporation governed by a Board of Directors. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b), § 4605(a). \n138.  The USIP Act set out the exclusive methods and circumstances under which a \nmember of the Board appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate under 22 U.S.C. § \n4605(b)(4) may be removed. 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). \n139.  The notices emailed to such Board members by Defendant Trent Morse on behalf \nof President Trump purporting to terminate the Board members did not satisfy any of the methods \nor bases for removal in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). \n140.  President Trump failed to comply with 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(1) by purporting to \nterminate members of the Board without “consult[ing] with the Board” and without identifying \nany “conviction of a felony, malfeasance in office, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 29 of 37\ndischarge duties.” 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(1). \n141.  President Trump failed to comply with 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(2) by purporting to \nremove the members of the Board without “the recommendation of eight voting members of the \nBoard.” \n142.  President Trump failed to comply with 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(3) by purporting to \nremove the members of the Board without “the recommendation of a majority of the members of \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of \nRepresentatives and a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Relations and the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate [now the HELP Committee]”. \n143.  Accordingly, President Trump’s actions to remove the members of USIP’s Board \nare unlawful, ultra vires, and without legal effect, and have caused Plaintiffs to suffer and \ncontinue to suffer imminent and irreparable harm. \n144.  Defendant Donald J. Trump’s ultra vires act also violates Art II, § 3 of the United \nStates Constitution. The Take Care Clause provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3. The Executive violates the Take Care \nClause where it fails to execute or otherwise acts contrary to statutes enacted by Congress and \nsigned into law.  \n145.  Defendant Trump’s unlawful removal of the Board members runs afoul of the \nConstitution’s command that the Executive faithfully execute federal law. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \n(Against Defendants GSA, OPM, DOS, DOGE, and DOGE TO) \n \n146.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate the allegations in the paragraphs above \nas though fully set forth herein. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 30 of 37\n147.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), this Court is empowered to \n“hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be”: (1) \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; (2) \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; (3) “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right”; or (4) “without observance of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n148.  DOGE is an agency subject to the APA.  \n149.  DOGE violated the APA when it forced entry into USIP’s privately-owned \nheadquarters,  seized  USIP’s  assets  without  consideration,  including  its  $500  million \nheadquarters, and destroyed USIP’s records for the purpose of harming USIP, its employees, \nand other constituents.  \n150.  DOGE’s actions constitute “final agency action[s] for which there is no other \nadequate remedy.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n151.  DOGE’s actions are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n152.  DOGE has no legitimate rationale or reasoned analysis that justifies the agency \nand its employees to muster private security contractors or engage law enforcement to forcibly \nenter a building owned and occupied by an independent non-profit corporation, or to seize \ncontrol and possession of the building and all physical property therein.  \n153.  DOGE’s  decision  to  seize  and  permanently  transfer  ownership  of  USIP \nheadquarters and the decision to seize and permanently transfer USIP Endowment assets is \nsubstantively unreasonable, DOGE has offered no legitimate rationale for its conduct, and \nDOGE has failed to consider Plaintiffs’ reliance interests and the assets required for USIP to \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 31 of 37\nperform its statutorily mandated functions.  \n154.  To date, DOGE’s expressed rationales for its misdeeds have been pretextual and \nunsupported by any reasoned analysis, and do not render lawful support for Defendants’ \nconduct.  \n155.  DOGE’s actions have caused Plaintiffs to suffer and continue to suffer imminent \nand irreparable harm. \n156.  As a result of DOGE’s final agency action, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue \nto suffer irreparable harm. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A-C)  \n(Against Defendants GSA, OPM, DOS, DOGE, DOGE TO, and USIP) \n \n157.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate the allegations in the paragraphs above \nas though fully set forth herein. \n158.  Under the APA, this Court is empowered to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \naction, findings, and conclusions found to be”: (1) “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law”; (2) “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity”; (3) “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right”; or (4) “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n159.  DOGE is an agency subject to the APA.  \n160.  In the alternative, USIP is an agency subject to the APA.  \n161.  Individually and collectively, the decision to effectively dismantle USIP by \nDOGE and/or the DOGE-co-opted USIP constitutes “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy.” 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n162.  DOGE and/or USIP have violated 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) in the following ways:  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 32 of 37\n163.  First, these Defendants’ actions, individually and collectively, are “arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n164.  Defendants have given no legitimate explanation for their decision to dismantle \nUSIP by (1) summary removal of its Board members; (2) terminating over 250 employees, (3) \nterminating benefits, (4) abruptly cancelling contracts with ineffective notice, (5) threatening to \nwind-down all international programs and grants and terminate all overseas personal service \ncontractors, (6) dissolving the Gandhi-King Global Academy, and (7) shutting down the USIP \nwebsite and render inaccessible all electronic resources. \n165.  The absence of “reasoned analysis” accompanying Defendants’ actions render \nthem arbitrary and capricious. Defendants have also failed to consider the reliance interests of \nPlaintiffs, and have offered no legitimate rationale for the decision to shutter USIP and the \nconduct taken in furtherance of that act. \n166.  Despite the fact that Defendant Cavanaugh has expressly confirmed that USIP is \nstill responsible for its mandate pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4601(a)(9), as well as the obligations \nenumerated in § 4604(b)(1)-(10), Defendant DOGE/DOGE TO has eviscerated all internal \nsystems and processes, terminated all employees with relevant training and experience, and has \nleft no mechanisms in place to implement programs or manage contracts.  \n167.  To date, Defendants’ expressed rationales for their misdeeds have been either \npretextual and/or lacking any reasoned analysis, and do not render support for Defendants’ \nunlawful conduct. \n168.  Second, the final decision of Defendant DOGE and/or the DOGE-co-opted USIP \nto effectively shutter USIP is “not in accordance with law” and is “in excess of statutory \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 33 of 37\njurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  \n169.  Congress established USIP via the USIP Act, which expressly withholds from \nUSIP the power to “cease its corporate activities” or dissolve itself, incorporating by reference \nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b); id. § 4604(a) (all \npowers except section 5(o) of the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act); Pub. L. No. \n87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962).  \n170.  The actions of Defendant DOGE and Defendant USIP to dismantle USIP violate \nthis statutory mandate. \n171.  Further, the Gandhi-King Act mandates that USIP establish and operate the \nGandhi-King Global Academy, “a professional development training initiative on conflict \nresolution  tools  based  on  the  principles  of  nonviolence.” DOGE/DOGE  TO  and  USIP \nDefendants have expressly violated this mandate by terminating all employees of this Academy, \neliminating all of USIP’s contracting staff and systems, cutting off funding streams, and \neffectively ceasing its existence. \n172.  Third,  the  final  decisions  of  DOGE  and/or  USIP  are  also  “contrary  to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). Defendants’ conduct \nviolates the separation of powers, including the legislature’s exclusive authority to make law, \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 1, by unilaterally ceasing statutorily mandated functions and effectively \nshuttering an agency that Congress has created by statute.  \n173.  As a result of Defendant DOGE and/or Defendant USIP’s final agency action, \nPlaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires Action by Federal Employees \n(Against Defendants Gleason, Cavanaugh, Jackson, Rubio, Hegseth, and Garvin) \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 34 of 37\n174.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant equitable and injunctive relief \n“with respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCtr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015); Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. \n682, 689 (1949) (equitable relief available against federal officials who act “beyond th[e] \nlimitations” imposed by federal statute). \n175.  Defendants  Gleason,  Cavanaugh,  Jackson,  Rubio,  Hegseth,  and  Garvin,  as \nindividual federal employees in their official capacities as acting Administrator of DOGE, acting \npresident of USIP, and ex officio Board Members of USIP, have acted unlawfully and exceeded \nthe scope of their statutory authority, and violated constitutionally mandated separation of \npowers. \n176.  These Defendants do not have the power to “cease [USIP’s] corporate activities” \nor dissolve it. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b); id. § 4604(a) (all powers except section 5(o) of the District \nof Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act); Pub. L. No. 87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962). \nThey also do not have the power to disregard the Gandhi-King statutory edict to create and \noperate a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution tools based on the \nprinciples of nonviolence.  \n177.  As a result of these Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers/Ultra Vires \n(All Defendants) \n \n178.  Plaintiffs have an implied right of action under the Constitution to challenge \ngovernmental action that violates the separation of powers. Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 35 of 37\n179.  The power to make law resides exclusively with the legislative branch. U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 1.  \n180.  The Constitution vests executive power in the President, U.S. Const., art. II, and \nimposes on the President a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. \nart. II, § 3. \n181.  The President and Executive Branch have no constitutional power to unilaterally \nenact, amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, \n438-39 (1998).  \n182.  Congress  exercised  its  Article  I  legislative  authority  to  create  USIP  as  an \nindependent nonprofit entity. Congress has also exercised its Article I legislative authority to \nmandate that USIP carry out specific functions. Defendants’ actions unlawfully usurp Congress’s \nlegislative authority and are therefore ultra vires. \n183.  Therefore, Defendants’ actions were taken without legal authority and are ultra \nvires. \n184.  As a result of these Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090     Document 1     Filed 04/10/25     Page 36 of 37\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter each of the following \nforms of relief: \na.  Issue a temporary restraining order to (1) enjoin USIP, the Endowment of \nUSIP, USIP’s Board, and USIP’s officers from transferring any assets \noutside of USIP or the Endowment for USIP; (2) enjoin USIP, USIP’s \nBoard, and USIP’s officers from any new termination of USIP \nemployment or contracts; (3) restore all USIP employees terminated since \nMarch 14, 2025 to their prior roles on paid leave status so that they can \nobtain the health insurance, immigration, and other collateral benefits of \nemployment while this litigation unfolds; (4) enjoin Defendants from \npublishing and/or disclosing any information pertaining to the identify of \ncurrent and former employees, grantees, program partners, contractors, or \nPSCs; \nb.  Declare that USIP’s Board and officers as of March 14, 2025 are the \nlawful Board members and officers of USIP;  \nc.  Declare that all action taken by Defendants following the removal of USIP \nBoard members violated the Administrative Procedure Act, was ultra \nvires, and violated the separation of powers; \nd.  Award Plaintiffs nominal damages; \ne.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable fees, costs, expenses, including attorneys’ \nfees; and \nf.

      "text": "Case 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 46     Filed 07/03/25     Page 1 of 6\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n \nSASHA PIPPENGER, et al.,  \n \n  Plaintiffs, \n \n  v.  Civil Action No. 25-1090 (BAH) \n \nU.S. DOGE SERVICE, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \nJOINT MOTION TO MODIFY COURT’S JUNE 5, 2025 ORDER \n  Plaintiffs and Defendants jointly move to modify this Court’s June 5, 2025 Order (ECF \nNo. 40) to renew a temporary stay of further proceedings in this case, including Defendants’ \ndeadlines to respond to Plaintiffs’ motion for discovery and amended complaint, pending further \ndevelopments in the related case United States Institute of Peace v. Jackson, Civ. A. No. 25-0804-\nBAH (D.D.C.). The Court’s “power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every \ncourt to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for \nitself, for counsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936); see also \nClinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706–07 (1997) (district courts have “broad discretion to stay \nproceedings”). \nBy way of background, on May 19, 2025, this Court granted the Jackson Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor summary judgment, awarding relief to the Jackson plaintiffs that is similar to the relief that \nPlaintiffs seek in this case (see Jackson ECF Nos. 39-40). The government appealed that decision \nand moved for a stay in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. Inst. of Peace v. Jackson, No. \n25-5185 (D.C. Cir. filed May 22, 2025) (“Jackson Appeal”). On June 4, 2025, the parties in this \nmatter jointly moved to temporarily stay proceedings in this case pending certain triggering events \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 46     Filed 07/03/25     Page 2 of 6\nin the Jackson case, including granting of the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal. ECF \nNo. 39. This Court granted the parties’ joint motion on June 5. ECF No. 40. On June 27, 2025, the \nD.C. Circuit granted the government’s motion for a stay pending appeal, and Defendants filed \nnotice of that denial, ECF No. 45, which automatically terminated the stay in this case per the \nterms of the June 5 Order. On June 29, 2025, the Jackson Plaintiffs filed a petition for rehearing \nen banc and application for emergency administrative stay in the D.C. Circuit. Jackson Appeal \nDoc. No. 2122789. On July 2, the D.C. Circuit ordered the government to respond to that petition \nby July 11. Appeal Doc. No. 2123429.     \nAs of the date of this filing, the Jackson Plaintiffs’ en banc petition remains pending. Given \nthe procedural posture as to the Jackson summary judgment motion, the parties to this case agree \nthat it would be in the interest of judicial economy to renew the temporary stay in this case under \nthe conditions set forth below: \nFirst, the stay will automatically terminate upon notice filed with the Court that (1) the \nD.C. Circuit has denied the Jackson Plaintiffs’ en banc petition, or, if either party requests relief \nfrom the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court has issued an order granting or allowing a stay \npending appeal, whichever is later; or (2) the D.C. Circuit or the Supreme Court has vacated or \nmodified any portion of the judgment in Jackson (see Jackson ECF Nos., 39-40). If any of these \nevents occurs, Defendants will promptly file notice of it on the Pippenger docket.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs may lift the stay at any point for any reason with two weeks’ email notice \nto Defendants.  \nThird, in the event that the stay is lifted for any reason, Plaintiffs will promptly provide \nemail notice to Defendants as to: whether they will maintain the discovery motion that is currently \npending at ECF No. 35; whether Plaintiffs withdraw that motion without prejudice; or whether \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 46     Filed 07/03/25     Page 3 of 6\nPlaintiffs will file an amended discovery motion. If Plaintiffs proceed with their current motion, \nDefendants will have two weeks from Plaintiffs’ notice to respond. If Plaintiffs amend their \ndiscovery motion, they will do so within two weeks of providing notice to Defendants. Defendants \nwill then have two weeks from the filing of the amended motion to respond, and Plaintiffs will \nhave one week to reply. \nFourth, in the event the stay is lifted for any reason, Defendants will have four weeks to \nrespond to the First Amended Complaint (ECF No. 9). \nFifth, Defendants reserve the right to move to re-stay the case for good cause. \nSixth, the parties will file a joint status report with the Court every 60 days from the date \nthat the Court enters this Order. \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant this motion and enter the proposed \norder staying this case, subject to the parties’ agreed conditions. \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nDated: July 3, 2025 \n   \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 46     Filed 07/03/25     Page 4 of 6\nEMERY CELLI BRINCKERHOFF  JEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nABADY WARD & MAAZEL LLP  United States Attorney \n   \nBy: /s/ Daniel M.

The  United  States  Institute  of  Peace  (“USIP”)  is  an  independent  non-profit \norganization based in Washington, D.C. that has a purpose of “promot[ing] international peace \nand the resolution of conflicts among the nations and peoples of the world without recourse to \nviolence.” USIP  was  created  via  an  Act  of  Congress  and  organized  under  the  non-profit \ncorporation laws of the District of Columbia. Until March 2025, USIP owned its own $500 million \nheadquarters building in Washington, D.C. and maintained an annual budget of roughly $55 \nmillion of Congressionally appropriated funds that it used to develop training and education in the \npeacebuilding field and resolve violent conflict around the world. \n2.  On March 14, 2025, that all changed. In a bizarre series of events that are anathema \nto how the United States government relates to American civil society, federal government \nagencies—the  Office  of  Personnel  Management  (“OPM”)  and  the  General  Services \nAdministration (“GSA”), the United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”), and the other federal \ngovernment Defendants in this case broke into USIP’s headquarters using agents from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and a leftover skeleton key held by USIP’s former security \ncontractor, fired USIP’s independent Board of Directors in violation of their statutory removal \nprotections, usurped USIP’s Board, and arrested USIP’s functioning. Defendants transferred \nUSIP’s $500 million building to GSA for no consideration, drained the Endowment of USIP—\nanother independent, legal entity organized under the laws of the District of Columbia—and fired \nalmost all of its employees and contractors, including those working in active warzones abroad.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 4 of 37\n3.  Plaintiffs in this case—former USIP employees suffering ongoing irreparable \nharm; a current USIP Personal Services Contractor (“PSC”) representing USIP in Libya without \nprotection from USIP’s security apparatus, which has been dismantled; a USIP programming \npartner dedicated to engaging youth in Russia and Ukraine in peace dialogues; USIP vendors who \nare owed funds from USIP for work that they have performed under lawful contract but have not \nbeen paid; and a donor to the Endowment for the USIP, which has been raided by Defendants—\nask this Court to stop the bloodletting of USIP and the Endowment for USIP—by issuing a \ntemporary restraining order, enjoining further illegal activities by Defendants, including the now \nco-opted  USIP  itself,  and  vitiating  the  irreparable,  collateral  consequences  of  Defendants’ \nunlawful actions that have no other remedy at law. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n4.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (federal \nquestion) and 28 U.S.C. § 1343 (action to redress deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution \nof the United States). \n5.  Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (e)(1).

Crocker reside in this District. \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 5 of 37\nPARTIES \nPlaintiffs \n \n6.

Defendant Trent Morse is the Deputy Director of Presidential Personnel in the  \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office, the White House Office, and the Executive Office of  \nthe President of the United States. \n28.  Defendant  United  States  Institute  of  Peace  is  an  independent,  non-profit \ncorporation created by Congress in 1984 that has been coopted, as of March 14, 2025, by the other \nDefendants as alleged in this Complaint. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 8 of 37\n29.  Defendant Endowment of the United States Institute for Peace is a 501(c)(3) non-\nprofit organization registered in Washington, D.C. that was mandated by Congress and created by \nUSIP to support USIP’s fulfilling its Congressional mandate, and which has been coopted, as of \nMarch 14, 2025, by the other Defendants as alleged in this Complaint. \n30.  For the purpose of this Complaint, all references to “DOGE” are inclusive of U.S. \nDOGE Service, DOGE TO, OPM, GSA, and DOS to the extent they are acting in concert. \nJURY DEMAND \n \n31.  Plaintiffs hereby demand a jury trial as to all matters properly triable by jury. \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \nStructure, Powers, and Functions of USIP \n \n32.  USIP is an independent nonprofit corporation created by Congress in 1984 via the \nUnited  States  Institute  of  Peace  Act  (“USIP  Act”)  to  promote  peaceful  conflict  resolution \nworldwide. 22 U.S.C. § 4601, et seq. \n33.  The purpose of USIP is to  \nserve the people and the Government through the widest possible \nrange  of  education  and  training,  basic  and  applied  research \nopportunities,  and  peace  information  services  on  the  means  to \npromote international peace and the resolution of conflicts among \nthe nations and peoples of the world without recourse to violence. \n \nId. § 4601(b). \n \n34.  Prior to the unlawful conduct at issue here, USIP employed roughly 300 employees \nwith an annual operating budget of roughly $55 million through Congressional appropriations, and \ncontracted with PSCs and vendors around the world in furtherance of its global mission. \n35.  USIP acts through a Board of Directors (the “Board”) to advance the purpose of the \nUSIP through a variety of discretionary activities directed by the Board, such as supporting \nscholarly  inquiry  on  international  peace  and  conflict  resolution,  developing  publications, \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 9 of 37\nestablishing a clearinghouse for storing information from the field of peace learning, and creating \none or more legal entities organized under the laws of the District of Columbia to support its \npurposes.  \n36.  The powers and duties of USIP are, to the extent consistent with the USIP Act, “the \npowers conferred upon a nonprofit corporation by the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation \nAct,” Pub. L. No. 87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962), with the exception of section 5(o) of \nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act. \n37.  Because USIP does not have the power conferred under section 5(o) of that Act, \nUSIP cannot, on its own or through its officers, “cease its corporate activities” or dissolve itself. \n38.  In 2020, Congress passed and President Donald J. Trump signed into law the \n“Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Initiative Act,” which obligates USIP to create and maintain \n“a professional development training initiative.” Congress mandated that: “The president and chief \nexecutive officer of the United States Institute of Peace shall create a professional development \ntraining initiative on conflict resolution tools based on the principles of nonviolence.”  \n39.  Congress enumerated four statutorily mandated activities of the Academy, and \nexpressly prohibited USIP from contracting out this work to other entities.  \n40.  The USIP Act makes clear that USIP is a non-governmental entity.  \n41.  USIP functions as a non-governmental entity. For example, USIP:  \na.  Maintains (or at least maintained) a “.org” domain and not “.gov” for its official \nwebsite. \nb.  Has independent discretion as to whether it responds to “the request of a \ndepartment or agency of the United States Government to examine, study, and \nreport on any issue [], 22 U.S.C. § 4604(e); \nc.  Has independent discretion to enter into personal services and other contracts, \n22 U.S.C. § 4604(f); \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 10 of 37\nd.  Is authorized by law to direct unobligated appropriated funds to its Endowment \nand spend them “without regard to fiscal year limitations, 22 U.S.C. § 4609(b); \ne.  Maintains its own private auditor, 22 U.S.C. § 4607; \nf.  May sue and be sued, 22 U.S.C. § 4604(k); \ng.  Has power over its land;1 \nh.  Built its own Washington, D.C. headquarters building, a $500 million asset, \nwith privately raised funds; \ni.  Pays its employees via a private payroll provider; \nj.  Maintains its own procurement, grant, and contracting policies that are distinct \nfrom the uniform federal policies applicable to the Executive Branch; \nk.  Does not use Office of Personnel Management forms to mark personnel actions \nbecause its employees are not employed by the federal government; and \nl.  Does not offer its employees any of the suite of benefits associated with \nemployment in federal agencies, such as the Federal Employee Health Benefits, \nFederal Employee Retirement System, Thrift Savings Program, and federal \ntravel benefits (such as the General Services Administration City Pair Program \nnegotiated airfares). \n42.  However,  USIP  is  subject  to  FOIA,  has  grant-making  authority  with  public \nfunds, 22  U.S.C.  §§  4603(c),  4604(b)(1),  (d),  4606(b);  is  tasked  with  making  reports  to \nCongress, id. § 4604(c)(3); may obtain services from the General Services Administration, id. § \n4604(o), receives annual Congressional appropriations, and may access classified materials. 22 \nU.S.C. § 4603 (e).  \n43.  That Congress expressly enumerated these functions and powers distinguishes \nUSIP from other federal agencies, for which these functions and powers are assumed and \ntherefore not enumerated. \n \n1 Pub. L. 104-201 § 2831 (giving the USIP administrative jurisdiction—effectively a permanent rent-free \ntenancy—over three acres); Pub. L. 109-364 § 2842 (giving USIP administrative jurisdiction over an \nadditional acre, including two buildings that were subsequently renovated and renamed the Bush and \nClinton Buildings). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 11 of 37\nThe USIP Board of Directors \n \n44.  USIP has a 15-member bipartisan Board of Directors. By statute, not more than \neight members of the Board may be from the same political party. 22 U.S.C. § 4605(c). \n45.  Twelve members of the Board are appointed to the Board by the President of the \nUnited States following confirmation by the United States Senate. See 22 U.S.C. § 4605(b)(4). \nNone of these 12 Board members can simultaneously serve as Government officials, and all must \nhave commensurate practical or academic experience in peace and conflict resolution efforts. Id. \n§ 4605(b), (d).  \n46.  Three Board members are ex officio members: the Secretary of State, Secretary of \nDefense, and the president of the National Defense University—or their United States Senate-\nconfirmed designee. Each ex officio member of the Board serves in their role at the pleasure of the \nPresident. \n47.  One member of the non-ex officio Board members is elected by the other non-ex \nofficio members to serve a three-year term as Chairman of the Board.  \n48.  The Board may appoint a president of USIP, who is to oversee the day-to-day \nadministration of the affairs of USIP and serve as a non-voting ex officio member of the Board. \nBoard Member Removal \n \n49.  The 12 non-ex officio Board members can only be removed from their positions in \none of three ways. See 22 U.S.C. § 4605 (b), (d), (f) \n50.  First, the President may remove them “in consultation with the Board, for conviction \nof a felony, malfeasance in office, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to discharge duties.” \n51.  Second, “the President may remove them upon the recommendation of eight voting \nmembers of the Board . . . pursuant to action taken at a meeting of the Board.” \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 12 of 37\n52.  Third, they may be removed “upon the recommendation of a majority of the \nmembers of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Education and Labor of the \nHouse of Representatives and a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign Relations \nand the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.” \nThe United States DOGE Service \n53.  After assuming office on January 20, 2025, President Trump issued Executive \nOrder  14158  entitled  “Establishing  and  Implementing  the  President’s  ‘Department  of \nGovernment Efficiency,’” (the “DOGE EO”). Section one of the DOGE EO states that its purpose \nis to “establish[] the Department of Government Efficiency to implement the President’s DOGE \nAgenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency \nand productivity.”  \n54.  The DOGE EO further establishes an Administrator reporting to the White House \nChief of Staff, and establishes the “U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization,” (“DOGE \nTO”) headed by the Administrator. DOGE EO, Section 3(b). \n55.  On February 11, 2025, President Trump issued Executive Order 14210 that lays out \nDOGE’s role in “eliminating waste, bloat, and insularity” and its mandate to work with agency \nheads to create and implement hiring plans, including anointing DOGE with the power to decide \nwhich vacancies should be filled. The DOGE TO Administrator is obligated to “submit a report \nto the President regarding implementation of this order, including a recommendation as to \nwhether any of its provisions should be extended, modified, or terminated.” \n56.  The  White  House  publicly  announced  that  Amy  Gleason  is  the  Acting \nAdministrator of DOGE and/or DOGE TO. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 13 of 37\n57.  As of February 19, 2025, DOGE had at least 34 employees, of which 20 are listed \nas being at the Executive Office of the President and the remaining 14 staffers are listed as \nworking at various federal agencies. \n58.  Defendant  Nate  Cavanaugh—a  28-year-old  tech  entrepreneur  with  no  prior \ngovernment service and no experience in the field of peacebuilding, and the purported current \npresident of USIP—has been widely reported to be employed by and working at the behest of \nGSA, OPM, and DOGE. \n59.  DOGE has an operating budget of $14.4 million. DOGE has established a website \nwith a .gov URL (https://doge.gov/) that includes the header “An official website of the United \nStates government” and an X account (@DOGE)), both of which are used to promote its work, \nfindings, and actions, such as cancelling contracts and grants.  \nDOGE Has a Track Record of Attempting to Shutter Governmental and Non-Governmental \nAgencies and Institutions in Violation of Law \n \n60.  In implementing President Trump’s Executive Orders pertaining to the size of the \nfederal  government,  DOGE—facilitated  by  OPM  and  GSA—has  begun  systematically \ndismantling and dissolving governmental and non-governmental agencies and institutions that \nreceive public funds.  \n61.  According  to  public  reporting,  DOGE  is  “exercising  significant  authority  by \ndirecting agencies to implement various policies, superintending personnel decisions purporting \nto close federal agencies, acquiring access to sensitive databases, and threatening agency officials \nwho fail to comply.”2 \n \n2  “Challenging  DOGE,”  Governing  for  Impact,  Feb.  2025,  https://governingforimpact.org/wp-\ncontent/uploads/2025/02/Challenging-DOGEPrimer-final.pdf. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 14 of 37\n62.  In the span of one month, for example, DOGE took over the Office of Personnel \nManagement,3 contributed to a humanitarian crisis and the loss of 50,000 jobs by unlawfully \nattempting  to  shutter  the  Congressionally-authorized  U.S.  Agency  for  International \nDevelopment, and touted its success in cancelling $1 billion in contracts across 25 agencies and \ncutting $900 million in education funding.4 \n63.  On February 19, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14217. The stated \npurpose of the Executive Order is to “reduce the size of the Federal Government,” with “a \nreduction in the elements . . . that the President has determined are unnecessary.” The Executive \nOrder lists federal entities that “shall be eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with \napplicable law, and such entities shall reduce the performance of their statutory functions and \nassociated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.”  \n64.  The Executive Order names the Institute as one of the entities purportedly covered \nby the order. Other listed entities included the Inter-American Foundation (“IAF”) and the U.S. \nAfrican Development Foundation (“USADF”). \n65.  On March 4, 2025, DOGE announced that it had reduced IAF, an entity with a $60 \nmillion operating budget, to its statutory minimum: one employee. \n \n3 Will Steakin & Laura Romero, OPM, implementing Musk's DOGE plans, sends federal workers 2nd 'Fork \nin the Road' email, ABC News (Feb. 3, 2025), https://abcnews.go.com/US/opm-implementing-musks-\ndoge-plans-sends-federalworkers/story?id=118401375; Chas Danner, All the Federal Agencies DOGE Has \nGotten Access To, NY Mag.

On February 20, the day after issuance of EO 14217, a representative of DOGE \ncontacted USIP. On February 24, Ambassador George Moose, acting president of USIP, and \nUSIP’s outside counsel, met virtually with DOGE representatives, including Defendant Nate \nCavanaugh. \n67.  The  DOGE  representatives  erroneously  asserted  that  the  only  statutory \nrequirements of USIP are the existence of its Board, the appointment of a president, the payment \nof incidental expenses for the Board, and the submission of certain reports to Congress and the \nExecutive Branch. \n68.  On or about March 14, 2025, USIP’s Board of Directors had 14 members: the three \nex  officio  members  under  22  U.S.C.  §  4605(b)(1)-(3),  and  eleven  members  who  had  been \nappointed with the advice and consent of the Senate pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4605(b)(4). \n69.  On  or  about  March  14,  2025,  Defendant  Trent  Morse  of  the  White  House \nPresidential Personnel Office purported to fire, via email—under the authority of Defendant \nPresident Donald J. Trump—ten members of the Board of Directors (the eleventh Board member \nresigned prior to this unlawful firing)—other than the three serving ex officio. \n70.  The termination emails did not state any justification and violated the removal \nprotections afforded to Board members under the USIP Act. \n71.  Because members of the Board were unlawfully removed by the President, all \nsubsequent actions by the remaining ex officio members and Defendant Cavanaugh are ultra vires \nand void ab initio, including all employment terminations, contract cancellations, and the cessation \nof services. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 16 of 37\n72.  Following this unlawful removal, only three Board members remained: Defendants \nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and President of the National \nDefense University Peter Garvin—all of whom possess their Board seats via service in other \npositions in the federal government at the pleasure of the President. \n73.  Also on March 14, 2025, representatives from GSA and/or DOGE and Defendant \nKenneth Jackson appeared at USIP headquarters building requesting access. USIP representatives \ndenied them entry. \n74.  Later  that  same  evening,  Defendants  Cavanaugh  and  other  DOGE  personnel \nreturned to USIP headquarters accompanied by FBI Special Agents and presented George Foote, \ncounsel to USIP, with a “resolution” signed by the three ex officio members of the Board purporting \nto remove George Moose from his position as acting president of USIP.  \n75.  On March 17, 2025, at approximately 2:30 p.m., four employees of Inter-Con \nSecurity  Systems  Inc.  (“Inter-Con”),  USIP’s  former  security  contractor,  arrived  at  USIP \nheadquarters at the behest of DOGE and/or DOGE TO.  \n76.  Inter-Con had been told by GSA and/or DOGE employees that every federal \ncontract Inter-Con held would be cancelled if they did not let Defendant Jackson into the building. \n77.  Inter-Con employees were unable to enter the building because their badges had \nbeen deactivated upon suspension of USIP’s contract with Inter-Con. \n78.  Upon their failed entry, another Inter-Con employee arrived with a physical key \nthat USIP had not yet confiscated, and used this key to enter USIP headquarters and let other Inter-\nCon employees in.  \n79.  After entering the headquarters building, the Inter-Con employees were advised by \nUSIP staff on-site that they were trespassing. Nevertheless, they continued toward USIP’s gun \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 17 of 37\nsafe, at which point Mr. Foote contacted the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department (the \n“MPD”) to report the unlawful intrusion.  \n80.  When MPD officers arrived, they forcibly entered the building, allowing DOGE \nand DOGE TO employees to gain unlawful access and begin expelling everyone from the building, \nincluding acting president Moose, USIP staff, and outside counsel Mr. Foote.  \n81.  That same day, Anna Kelly, Deputy White House Press Secretary, posted on X in \nresponse to a different message on X with a purported quote from George Moose, president and \nCEO of USIP that “DOGE has broken into our building”: \n \n  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 18 of 37\n82.  Accompanying Ms. Kelly’s message was an image of the undated purported \n“resolution” of the Rubio-Hegseth-Garvin Board of Directors to terminate Moose and appoint \nDefendant Jackson. At the time, Defendant Jackson also held a position at USAID where he was \nleading DOGE’s efforts to dismantle the agency. \n83.  On or about March 18, 2025, DOGE and/or DOGE TO employees started physical \ndestruction of the USIP building, including tearing the USIP seal off the wall and breaking it into \npieces, and shredding hard copy documents. \n84.  The same day, USIP employees learned that DOGE employees could access all \nsystems, computers, and phones.  \n85.  Later that day, some USIP employees were alerted that DOGE representatives were \nsending email messages from USIP email addresses to contractors and program partners on behalf \nof USIP program staff. \n86.  When USIP staff lost access to their accounts, they simultaneously lost access to a \nvirtual private network that allowed staff to connect to USIP’s financial management system, and \nthereby their ability to conduct business on behalf of USIP, including paying invoices submitted \nby USIP contractors. \n87.  Around this time, USIP had roughly 792 open contracts, orders, or task orders, with \ntotal obligations of approximately $65.7 million. These contractors were located in over 63 \ncountries. As of March 21, 2025, USIP had issued roughly 56 advances that combined equaled \n$1,482,535.57.  \n88.  On March 19, 2024, Karoline Leavitt, White House Press Secretary, responded to \na question asked during a White House press conference about DOGE’s forced entry into USIP’s \nheadquarters. She responded as follows: \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 19 of 37\nWe were made aware of this story by individuals at DOGE, Elon \nMusk’s team, and also at the State Department, who were unable to \naccess this building. [And it] became very clear that there was a \nconcerted effort among the rogue bureaucrats at the United States \nInstitute of Peace to actually physically barricade themselves, essentially, \ninside of the building to prevent political appointees of this \nadministration, who work at the direction of the President of the United \nStates, to get into the building. \n \n89.  On Friday, March 21, all USIP employees were instructed via personal email and/or \nmessaging applications to personal phones to submit their timesheets for the pay period no later \nthan 5:00 p.m. \n90.  On or about March 25, 2025, a document containing a list of all employees and \nPSCs working in country offices, including personally identifiable information, was circulated to \nthe unsecured personal email addresses of 12 USIP staff members, including country directors and \ntheir respective center vice presidents. \n91.  Several  of  the  staff  members  whose  personally  identifiable  information  was \ndisclosed in this document are from, live, or work in countries where they would be at risk of \nphysical harm, including arbitrary arrest, detention, and/or torture, for being associated with the \nUSIP. These  staff were directed to identify a  location to which they could safely relocate \nthemselves by April 9, 2025. Employees and PSCs working in country offices were directed to \nsubmit their relocation plans two days later, by Thursday, March 27, 2025. \n92.  Later that same day, Justin Fox, a GSA employee deployed by and through the \nunlawful authority of DOGE, sent an email indicating that all staff should begin taking operational \nsteps to close offices and programs, including ending of and residential leases, and “should operate \nunder the assumption that any program exclusive to USIP will begin wind-down on April 9th.” \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 20 of 37\n93.  On or about March 21, 2025, Defendant Jackson purported to fire at least six USIP \nemployees, all of whom had been present at headquarters and involved in preventing DOGE’s \nentry into the building on both March 14 and March 17. \n94.  On or about March 25, by a resolution of two of the three ex officio Board members, \nMr. Jackson ended his purported position as acting president of USIP and Nate Cavanaugh was \nnamed in his stead. \n95.  Two of the three ex officio Board members, Defendants Rubio and Hegseth, also \nsigned a resolution removing Endowment officers and instructing the newly appointed head to \ntransfer all Endowment assets to USIP.  \n96.  Following his appointment as acting president of USIP, Defendant Cavanaugh sent \na letter to GSA requesting that GSA “accept transfer of excess property[,]” USIP’s headquarters—\na $500 million building that USIP, and USIP alone, had built with private donations and owned—\nfor less than the property’s fair market value. \n97.  Defendant  Cavanaugh  also  communicated  that  USIP  would  be  “capable”  of \nadvanc[ing] the history, science, art, and practice of international peace and the resolution of \nconflicts among nations without the use of violence” without the ownership of a large and \nexpensive building. 22 U.S.C. § 4601(a)(9). He also stated that USIP’s obligations still included \nthose set forth in § 4604(b)(1)-(10). \n98.  Prior to Defendant Cavanaugh’s unauthorized and unlawful transfer of the building, \nUSIP had been the lawful owner of the headquarters building, which was built by private \ncontractors engaged by USIP and paid for by a combination of special appropriations and private \ngifts, as authorized by 22 U.S.C. § 4604(h)(3)(A). \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 21 of 37\nMass-Firings Begin on March 28, 2025 \n \n99.  Beginning around 9:00 pm on Friday, March 28, 2025, Plaintiffs and other USIP \nemployees began receiving termination letters via their personal email addresses.  \n100.  The termination emails stated: “This letter is to inform you of a change in your \nemployment status with United State [sic] Institute of Peace. Effective March 28, 2025, your \nemployment with us will conclude. We understand that this is a significant change, and we are \ncommitted to supporting you through the offboarding process. Please see the attached USIP Staff \nExit Checklist and send your signed agreement to HumanResources@usip.org.” \n101.  Attached to each email was a document titled, “Separation Agreement and Release \nof Claims” dated March 28, 2025 (“the Letter”). The Letter was sent, unsigned, by Mirna Rivas as \n“Acting President of Human Resources.”  \n102.  The Letter stated that employees were terminated from their positions “[at] the \ndirection of the President of the United States Institute of Peace” and that employees would receive \non or around April 11, 2025 all unpaid wages and accrued, unused annual leave. Additionally, \nemployee healthcare benefits would end on March 31, 2025, less than one business day after notice \nof termination, with the option to continue benefits at the employee’s expense pursuant to the \nConsolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”). \n103.  No mention was made as to the impact of termination on other USIP benefits, such \nas flexible spending accounts, health spending accounts, or retirement accounts. \n104.  No date was provided for returning the signed Letter, except for those employees \naged 40 or older who were asked to return the letter within 21 days, thereby releasing their right \nto an additional 24 days of review pursuant to the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act in the \nevent of a group layoff. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 22 of 37\n105.  By midnight on March 28, 2025, at least 265 USIP employees had been \nterminated. \n106.  This included all 33 employees of the Gandhi-King Global Academy (“GKGA”), \nas well as almost all contracting staff and others responsible for essential programming functions \nand oversight. Additional PSCs affiliated with the GKGA were terminated on March 31, 2025. \n107.  On or about midnight, March 28, 2025, USIP employees received their paychecks \nfor work performed under the previous pay period starting March 9, 2025, and ending March 22, \n2025. \nDOGE Defendants Continue to Dissolve All USIP Programs and Funding  \n \n108.  On March 29, 2025, hours after the now co-opted, DOGE-Rubio-Hegseth-Garvin-\nCavanaugh-controlled USIP terminated the employment of hundreds of USIP employees, Anna \nKelly, Deputy White House Press Secretary, told CBS News via written statement: \nTaxpayers don’t want to spend $50 million per year on a publicly-\nfunded “research institute” that has failed to deliver peace. President \nTrump ended the era of forever wars and established peace in his \nfirst term, and he is carrying out his mandate to eliminate bloat and \nsave taxpayer dollars.5 \n109.  On March 31, 2025, the official DOGE X account posted: \n \n5 https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-institute-of-peace-staff-termination-notices/. \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 23 of 37\n \n110.  Contrary to Defendant DOGE’s suggestion that USIP’s actions were improper, \nUSIP is authorized to move Congressionally appropriated funds to the Endowment at the end of \nevery fiscal year pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 4609(b). \n111.  The March 31, 2025 DOGE message also posted a list of four USIP contracts that \nhad purportedly been cancelled, including one that identified a former member of the Taliban who \nwas working to advance USIP’s peacebuilding efforts in Afghanistan. Public disclosure of this \ninformation has exposed this contractor to the world as working for USIP and led to death threats \nagainst him and his family has been harassed within Afghanistan.  \n112.  On April 1, 2025, the official DOGE X account posted, in reference to the March \n31, 2025 USIP X message: “Update: the $13M in taxpayer dollars has been returned to the \nTreasury.” \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 24 of 37\n \n \n \n113.  Defendant DOGE, and DOGE-co-opted Defendant USIP, have made clear the \nintent to shutter USIP permanently, leaving USIP unable to implement any of its programs or \nstatutorily mandated functions. \n114.  Since  GSA/DOGE  employee  Justin  Fox  first  informed  field  staff  that  all \nprogramming would be closing down on April 9, DOGE has continued to communicate further \nwind-downs through the end of May.  \n115.  On April 12, 2025, all Vice Presidents who had not been fired on March 28 received \ntermination notices effective April 18. These Vice Presidents oversee USIP’s field offices, which \nwill remain open until the end of May. These termination notices effectively leave field offices, \nfield staff, and PSCs without any headquarter supervision or security. \n116.  Summary  and  surprise  termination  of  all  of  USIP  contracting  staff  makes  it \nimpossible for USIP to conduct thorough and proper reconciliation between these advances and \nthe deliverables received to ensure taxpayers funds were spent properly. \n117.  On March 18, 2025, DOGE terminated USIP’s access to the international payment \nmodality of the Department of Treasury International Treasury Service and terminated USIP’s \nability to transfer funds from the U.S. Treasury to its bank account. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 25 of 37\n118.  On March 20, 2025, Defendant Cavanaugh directed the then-CFO Allison Blotzker \nto make Defendant Jackson the sole signatory of the Endowment’s bank accounts. \n119.  On March 24, Defendant Jackson denied the then-CFO Blotzker from requesting \nto apportion USIP’s appropriated funds from the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year \n2025. \n120.  On March 24, Defendant Jackson also denied the then-CFO Blotzker’s request to \nrestore employee access to transfer payroll funds. Defendants fired Blotzer on March 25, 2025. \nPlaintiffs Will Suffer Immediate and Irreparable Harm Due to Defendants’ Violations of Law \n \n121.  Plaintiff Sasha Pippenger was the Director of Peace Processes at USIP until her \nemployment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Plaintiff Pippenger has been diagnosed with \nankylosing spondylitis, a serious and incurable autoimmune disease that requires a costly drug \ninfusion treatment every six weeks without lapses.  \n122.  Plaintiff Quinlan served as the Program Officer for Public Engagement and D.C. \nPartnerships at USIP until her employment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Plaintiff Quinlan \nhas been diagnosed with a Chiari I malformation in her brain, which, if left untreated, can result \nin permanent neurological damage.  \n123.  Plaintiffs Pippenger and Quinlan, along with other former employees and their \nfamilies who have relied on USIP health insurance, are at imminent risk of dire, long-term health \nconsequences as a result of the Defendants’ abrupt termination of health insurance and complete \nlack of communication regarding alternatives. Defendants’ unlawful conduct has caused Ms. \nQuinlan to forego critical and urgent medical testing and treatment, which she will continue to \nhave to forego absent reinstatement and return of her health insurance coverage. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 26 of 37\n124.  Plaintiff  Bosley  was  the  Acting  Director  for  the  Program  on  Violence  and \nExtremism at USIP until his employment was terminated on March 28, 2025. Mr. Bosley relied \non existing USIP policies & practices related to termination and severance when deciding to start \nthe process of having a baby with his spouse via surrogacy. Having been abruptly terminated with \nno notice or severance, he cannot be sure of his ability to move forward with surrogacy. \n125.  Defendants DOGE and DOGE-co-opted Defendant USIP, have taken significant \nsteps towards permanently dissolving USIP, and as a result, Plaintiffs Pippenger, Quinlan, and \nBosley, and all other terminated employees, will lose the ability to participate in USIP’s COBRA \nhealth insurance coverage. \n126.  Plaintiff Mohamed Khalil Abuznad is a Libyan national residing in Tripoli, Libya \nwho is currently employed by USIP as a PSC. Abuznad faces imminent and irreparable harms \nshould his contract be abruptly terminated or his name publicized, as DOGE has done for another \nUSIP contractor. Abuznad has already lost access to security protections—DOGE had cancelled \nthe security services team contract. On April 11, Abuznad received a termination notice of his \ncontract, effective May 31, 2025. The imminent termination of his contract will expose him to \nadditional personal risk, leaving Abuznad and his family vulnerable to targeting and retaliation, \nincluding death threats.  \n127.  Plaintiff Brave Generation, a non-profit entity that partners with USIP’s Center for \nRussia  and  Europe  on  dialogues,  trusted  USIP  and  its  employees  to  maintain  secure  and \nconfidential data management protocols. Brave Generation participants and their families in \nUkraine and Russia could face serious, irreparable harms should their participation in peace \ndialogues be disclosed, which is imminently likely due to DOGE’s seizure of communications and \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 27 of 37\ndata at USIP—DOGE has already leaked confidential information about grantees and continues to \ndo so. \n128.  Plaintiff Crocker is a donor to the Endowment of USIP, who specifically pledged \nmoney to USIP for supporting a permanent named conference room at USIP headquarters and \npeacebuilding activities on campus. His donation has now been co-opted by DOGE and the \nDOGE-Rubio-Hegseth-Cavanaugh-controlled  USIP  and  Endowment  for  USIP,  and  his \ncontributions have not been used consistent with the lawful purposes of such donations. This co-\noption is contrary to his intent and the conditions of his donations, and he fears that the impact of \nhis  donation—supporting  USIP’s  mission—will  be  permanently  lost  if  DOGE  continues  to \ntransfer assets from the Endowment. He suffers reputational harm from Defendants’ ongoing, \nbaseless maligning of USIP. \n129.  Plaintiffs InterMotion, LLC and Peace in Praxis, LLC, both contractors of USIP, \nare owed money by USIP for work done pursuant to lawful contract, and, despite their best efforts, \nhave been unable to collect. If USIP is shuttered, they will lose the ability to obtain recompense \nfor work already performed. USIP’s breach of contract and failure to provide required notice of \ncancellation of contract also poses imminent reputational and business harms to USIP contractors, \nmany of whom are small businesses and are unable to pay subcontractors. \n130.  Plaintiff Shira Lowinger was the Director of Grants and Contracts Administration \nin the Office of Finance at USIP until her employment was terminated on March 28, 2025, and \nattests to the serious and myriad harms caused by the abrupt cancellation of hundreds of USIP \ncontracts around the world, including in active warzones. The abrupt decision to terminate the \nmajority of USIP employees and contractors, and to cancel contracts without notice or final \npayment,  is  extremely  harmful  to  USIP  and  its  personnel,  and  has  resulted  in  irreparable \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 28 of 37\nconsequences for USIP’s operations, legal protections, and the safety and financial security of \nUSIP’s employees, contractors, and research subjects. \n131.  If USIP is shuttered, Plaintiffs Pippenger, Quinlan, Bosley, Lowinger, and others, \nwill have no other remedy at law for redress of Defendants’ illegal actions that caused termination \nof their employment.  \n132.  All  Plaintiffs  who  are  currently  employed  by  or  have  been  terminated  by \nDefendants suffer the reputational harm of being baselessly maligned by Defendants on X and in \nthe media as “rogue” and wasteful bureaucrats defying the United States Government and the \ntaxpayer’s expense.  \n133.  Further delay in reinstating terminated employees and PSCs will irreparably harm \nthem—they have been left without income and many will be forced to seek other employment to \nmake up for this loss.  \n134.  The  Defendants’  actions  will  also  prevent  any  possibility  that  USIP  as  an \nindependent entity can survive—employee-Plaintiffs and others similarly situated are skilled \nprofessionals with decades of experience carrying out USIP’s mission. They cannot, without \nincome and attendant benefits, wait for litigation to play out for years while Defendants have \nclearly shown they are capable of dissolve USIP in a matter of weeks. \nFIRST CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires Action in Violation of 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f) and Violation of U.S. Const. Art II, § 3 \n(Against Defendants President Donald J. Trump and \nTrent Morse in their official capacities) \n \n135.  Plaintiffs hereby re-allege and incorporate by reference all paragraphs above as \nif fully set forth here. \n136.  Under the USIP Act, Congress established USIP as an independent nonprofit \ncorporation governed by a Board of Directors. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b), § 4605(a). \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 29 of 37\n137.  The USIP Act set out the exclusive methods and circumstances under which a \nmember of the Board appointed with the advice and consent of the Senate under 22 U.S.C. § \n4605(b)(4) may be removed. 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). \n138.  The notices emailed to such Board members by Defendant Trent Morse on behalf \nof President Trump purporting to terminate the Board members did not satisfy any of the methods \nor bases for removal in 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f). \n139.  President Trump failed to comply with 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(1) by purporting to \nterminate members of the Board without “consult[ing] with the Board” and without identifying \nany “conviction of a felony, malfeasance in office, persistent neglect of duties, or inability to \ndischarge duties.” 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(1). \n140.  President Trump exceeded his authority pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(2) by \npurporting to remove the members of the Board without “the recommendation of eight voting \nmembers of the Board.” \n141.  President Trump exceeded his authority pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4605(f)(3) by \npurporting to remove the members of the Board without “the recommendation of a majority of \nthe members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Education and Labor \nof the House of Representatives and a majority of the members of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate [now the HELP \nCommittee]”. \n142.  Accordingly, President Trump’s actions to remove the members of USIP’s Board \nare unlawful, ultra vires, and without legal effect, and have caused Plaintiffs to suffer and \ncontinue to suffer imminent and irreparable harm. \n143.  Defendant Donald J. Trump’s ultra vires act also violates Art II, § 3 of the United \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 30 of 37\nStates Constitution. The Take Care Clause provides that the Executive must “take Care that the \nLaws be faithfully executed.” U.S. Const. Art. II, § 3. The Executive violates the Take Care \nClause where it fails to execute or otherwise acts contrary to statutes enacted by Congress and \nsigned into law.  \n144.  Defendant Trump’s unlawful removal of the Board members runs afoul of the \nConstitution’s command that the Executive faithfully execute federal law. \nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) \n(Against Defendants GSA, OPM, DOS, DOGE, and DOGE TO) \n \n145.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate the allegations in the paragraphs above \nas though fully set forth herein. \n146.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), this Court is empowered to \n“hold unlawful and set aside agency action, findings, and conclusions found to be”: (1) \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law”; (2) \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity”; (3) “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right”; or (4) “without observance of \nprocedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n147.  DOGE is an agency subject to the APA.  \n148.  DOGE violated the APA when it forced entry into USIP’s privately-owned \nheadquarters,  seized  USIP’s  assets  without  consideration,  including  its  $500  million \nheadquarters, and destroyed USIP’s records for the purpose of harming USIP, its employees, \nand other constituents.  \n149.  DOGE’s actions constitute “final agency action[s] for which there is no other \nadequate remedy.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 31 of 37\n150.  DOGE’s actions are “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise \nnot in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n151.  DOGE has no legitimate rationale or reasoned analysis that justifies the agency \nand its employees to muster private security contractors or engage law enforcement to forcibly \nenter a building owned and occupied by an independent non-profit corporation, or to seize \ncontrol and possession of the building and all physical property therein.  \n152.  DOGE’s  decision  to  seize  and  permanently  transfer  ownership  of  USIP \nheadquarters and the decision to seize and permanently transfer USIP Endowment assets is \nsubstantively unreasonable, DOGE has offered no legitimate rationale for its conduct, and \nDOGE has failed to consider Plaintiffs’ reliance interests and the assets required for USIP to \nperform its statutorily mandated functions.  \n153.  To date, DOGE’s expressed rationales for its misdeeds have been pretextual and \nunsupported by any reasoned analysis, and do not render lawful support for Defendants’ \nconduct.  \n154.  DOGE’s actions have caused Plaintiffs to suffer and continue to suffer imminent \nand irreparable harm. \n155.  As a result of DOGE’s final agency action, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue \nto suffer irreparable harm. \nTHIRD CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)  \n(Against Defendants GSA, OPM, DOS, DOGE, DOGE TO, and USIP) \n \n156.  Plaintiffs repeat, reallege, and incorporate the allegations in the paragraphs above \nas though fully set forth herein. \n157.  Under the APA, this Court is empowered to “hold unlawful and set aside agency \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 32 of 37\naction, findings, and conclusions found to be”: (1) “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, \nor otherwise not in accordance with law”; (2) “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, \nor immunity”; (3) “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right”; or (4) “without observance of procedure required by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2). \n158.  DOGE is an agency subject to the APA.  \n159.  In the alternative, USIP is an agency subject to the APA.  \n160.  Individually and collectively, the decision to effectively dismantle USIP by \nDOGE and/or the DOGE-co-opted USIP constitutes “final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy.” 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \n161.  DOGE and/or USIP have violated 5 U.S.C. § 706(2) in the following ways:  \n162.  First, these Defendants’ actions, individually and collectively, are “arbitrary, \ncapricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law.”  5  U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  \n163.  Defendants have given no legitimate explanation for their decision to dismantle \nUSIP by (1) summary removal of its Board members; (2) terminating over 250 employees, (3) \nterminating benefits, (4) abruptly cancelling contracts with ineffective notice, (5) threatening to \nwind-down all international programs and grants and terminate all overseas personal service \ncontractors, (6) dissolving the Gandhi-King Global Academy, and (7) shutting down the USIP \nwebsite and render inaccessible all electronic resources. \n164.  The absence of “reasoned analysis” accompanying Defendants’ actions render \nthem arbitrary and capricious. Defendants have also failed to consider the reliance interests of \nPlaintiffs, and have offered no legitimate rationale for the decision to shutter USIP and the \nconduct taken in furtherance of that act. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 33 of 37\n165.  Despite the fact that Defendant Cavanaugh has expressly confirmed that USIP is \nstill responsible for its mandate pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 4601(a)(9), as well as the obligations \nenumerated in § 4604(b)(1)-(10), Defendant DOGE/DOGE TO has eviscerated all internal \nsystems and processes, terminated all employees with relevant training and experience, and has \nleft no mechanisms in place to implement programs or manage contracts.  \n166.  To date, Defendants’ expressed rationales for their misdeeds have been either \npretextual and/or lacking any reasoned analysis, and do not render support for Defendants’ \nunlawful conduct. \n167.  Second, the final decision of Defendant DOGE and/or the DOGE-co-opted USIP \nto effectively shutter USIP is “not in accordance with law” and is “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C).  \n168.  Congress established USIP via the USIP Act, which expressly withholds from \nUSIP the power to “cease its corporate activities” or dissolve itself, incorporating by reference \nthe District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b); id. § 4604(a) (all \npowers except section 5(o) of the District of Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act); Pub. L. No. \n87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962).  \n169.  The actions of Defendant DOGE and Defendant USIP to dismantle USIP violate \nthis statutory mandate. \n170.  Further, the Gandhi-King Act mandates that USIP establish and operate the \nGandhi-King Global Academy, “a professional development training initiative on conflict \nresolution  tools  based  on  the  principles  of  nonviolence.” DOGE/DOGE  TO  and  USIP \nDefendants have expressly violated this mandate by terminating all employees of this Academy, \neliminating all of USIP’s contracting staff and systems, cutting off funding streams, and \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 34 of 37\neffectively ceasing its existence. \n171.  Third,  the  final  decisions  of  DOGE  and/or  USIP  are  also  “contrary  to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). Defendants’ conduct \nviolates the separation of powers, including the legislature’s exclusive authority to make law, \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 1, by unilaterally ceasing statutorily mandated functions and effectively \nshuttering an agency that Congress has created by statute.  \n172.  As a result of Defendant DOGE and/or Defendant USIP’s final agency action, \nPlaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer irreparable harm. \nFOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nUltra Vires Action by Federal Employees \n(Against Defendants Gleason, Cavanaugh, Jackson, Rubio, Hegseth, and Garvin) \n \n173.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant equitable and injunctive relief \n“with respect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child \nCtr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015); Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. \n682, 689 (1949) (equitable relief available against federal officials who act “beyond th[e] \nlimitations” imposed by federal statute). \n174.  Defendants  Gleason,  Cavanaugh,  Jackson,  Rubio,  Hegseth,  and  Garvin,  as \nindividual federal employees in their official capacities as acting Administrator of DOGE, acting \npresident of USIP, and ex officio Board Members of USIP, have acted unlawfully and exceeded \nthe scope of their statutory authority, and violated constitutionally mandated separation of \npowers. \n175.  These Defendants do not have the power to “cease [USIP’s] corporate activities” \nor dissolve it. 22 U.S.C. § 4603(b); id. § 4604(a) (all powers except section 5(o) of the District \nof Columbia Nonprofit Corporation Act); Pub. L. No. 87-569, 17 Stat. 265, 268 (Aug. 6, 1962). \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 35 of 37\nThey also do not have the power to disregard the Gandhi-King statutory edict to create and \noperate a professional development training initiative on conflict resolution tools based on the \nprinciples of nonviolence.  \n176.  As a result of these Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm. \nFIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION \nViolation of the Separation of Powers/Ultra Vires \n(All Defendants) \n \n177.  Plaintiffs have an implied right of action under the Constitution to challenge \ngovernmental action that violates the separation of powers. Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \n178.  The power to make law resides exclusively with the legislative branch. U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 1.  \n179.  The Constitution vests executive power in the President, U.S. Const., art. II, and \nimposes on the President a duty to “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,” U.S. Const. \nart. II, § 3. \n180.  The President and Executive Branch have no constitutional power to unilaterally \nenact, amend, or repeal parts of duly enacted statutes. Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, \n438-39 (1998).  \n181.  Congress  exercised  its  Article  I  legislative  authority  to  create  USIP  as  an \nindependent nonprofit entity. Congress has also exercised its Article I legislative authority to \nmandate that USIP carry out specific functions. Defendants’ actions unlawfully usurp Congress’s \nlegislative authority and are therefore ultra vires. \n182.  Therefore, Defendants’ actions were taken without legal authority and are ultra \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 9     Filed 04/14/25     Page 36 of 37\nvires. \n183.  As a result of these Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to \nsuffer irreparable harm. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court enter each of the following \nforms of relief: \na.  Issue a temporary restraining order to (1) enjoin USIP, the Endowment of \nUSIP, USIP’s Board, and USIP’s officers from transferring any assets \noutside of USIP or the Endowment for USIP; (2) enjoin USIP, USIP’s \nBoard, and USIP’s officers from any new termination of USIP \nemployment or contracts; (3) restore all USIP employees terminated since \nMarch 14, 2025 to their prior roles on paid leave status so that they can \nobtain the health insurance, immigration, and other collateral benefits of \nemployment while this litigation unfolds; (4) enjoin Defendants from \npublishing and/or disclosing any information pertaining to the identify of \ncurrent and former employees, grantees, program partners, contractors, or \nPSCs; \nb.  Declare that USIP’s Board and officers as of March 14, 2025 are the \nlawful Board members and officers of USIP;  \nc.  Declare that all action taken by Defendants following the removal of USIP \nBoard members violated the Administrative Procedure Act, was ultra \nvires, and violated the separation of powers; \nd.  Declare that USIP and its Endowment are the lawful owners of the USIP \nheadquarters building at 2301 Constitution Ave NW; \ne.  Award Plaintiffs nominal damages; \nf.  Award Plaintiffs reasonable fees, costs, expenses, including attorneys’ \nfees; and \ng.

Howell \nU.S. DOGE SERVICE, et al., \n \nDefendants. \n \nMEMORANDUM AND ORDER  \nDENYING TEMPORARY INJUNCTIVE RELIEF  \nSeven plaintiffs, who include former employees, program partners, a current personal \nservices contractor, and a donor of the U.S. Institute of Peace (“USIP”), sued the U.S. DOGE \nService (“DOGE”), several DOGE (or DOGE-affiliated) officials (including the current \nPresident of USIP, Nate Cavanaugh), the existing ex officio members of USIP’s Board of \nDirectors, President Trump, White House staffer Trent Morse, the Office of Personnel \nManagement, the General Services Administration (“GSA”), the Department of State, as well as \nUSIP itself (collectively, “defendants”).  Am. Compl. ¶¶ 6-30, ECF No. 9.  Their claims arise out \nof the same set of alleged facts at issue in U.S. Institute of Peace v. Jackson, No. 25-cv-804, \nnamely, President Trump’s termination of USIP’s appointed Board members, the replacement of \nUSIP’s president by three remaining ex officio members, the subsequent transfer of USIP’s \nheadquarters and other assets to GSA, the termination of the majority of USIP’s employees, and \nbroad termination of its contracts and programming.  See generally Am. Compl.; Am. Compl., \nUSIP v. Jackson, 25-cv-804, ECF No. 12.  As in the prior related case, plaintiffs here allege that \nUSIP “is an independent non-profit organization” not subject to executive branch control.  Am. \nCompl. ¶¶ 1, 32, 136 (describing USIP as an “independent nonprofit corporation”); Am. Compl. \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 2 of 14\n¶¶ 1, 6, 30, 75, 77, USIP v. Jackson, 25-cv-804.  Plaintiffs assert, in five claims, that defendants \nacted ultra vires and in violation of the USIP Act’s statutory removal protections when removing \nUSIP’s former Board members, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 135-44, 156-72 (Counts 1, 3), that they violated \nthe APA by acting arbitrarily and capriciously when seizing control of USIP assets, id. ¶¶ 145-\n55, (Count 2), that they violated the APA by attempting to cease USIP’s activities and effectively \nshut it down, id. ¶¶ 156-72 (Count 3), that they acted ultra vires and violated the USIP Act and \nother statutory mandates in doing the same, id. ¶¶ 173-76 (Count 4), and that they violated \nseparation of powers by engaging in all of these acts, id. ¶¶ 177-183 (Count 5).     \nPlaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”) on April 14, 2025, seeking an \ninjunction directing a host of actions by defendants, including: (1) prohibiting (a) USIP, its \nEndowment, its Board, and its officers from transferring any assets out of USIP or the \nEndowment; (b) USIP, its Board, and its officers from terminating any further employees, \npersonal service contractors, or contracts; (c) defendants from publishing or disclosing the \nidentity of any current or former employees, grantees, program partners, or personal service \ncontractors; (2) restoring all terminated USIP employees and personal service contractors to their \nroles in a paid leave status so they can retain their benefits during litigation; and (3) transferring \nownership of USIP’s headquarters—which were previously transferred by defendant Cavanaugh, \nas president of USIP, to GSA—back to USIP.  Pls.’ Mot. for TRO (“Pls.’ Mot.”) at 14, ECF No. \n11; Pls.’ Proposed Order, ECF No. 11-18.  Plaintiffs also requested that the TRO include \ndeclarations that the former Board members were terminated unlawfully and that all subsequent \nactions after removal of those Board members were ultra vires, violated the APA, and violated \nseparation of powers.  See Pls.’ Proposed Order.  Defendants opposed.  See Defs.’ Opp’n, ECF \nNo. 18. \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 3 of 14\nAfter providing an opportunity for defendants to submit briefing explaining their \nopposition to plaintiffs’ claims, see Minute Order (Apr. 14, 2025), this Court held a hearing on \nthe motion for a TRO on April 16, 2025.  In response to the Court’s queries about the scope of \nthe requested relief, plaintiffs requested an opportunity to supplement their papers in support of a \nmore limited TRO, and after the hearing, plaintiffs timely filed a new proposed order, narrowing \ntheir request for relief.  See Pls.’ Notice Following Hr’g, Amended Proposed Order, Ex. A, ECF \nNo. 21-1.  Specifically, plaintiffs no longer request the inclusion in the TRO of any declarations, \nnor an injunction barring the publication or disclosure of identities of people affiliated with USIP \nand termination of any USIP employees or contracts (apart from personal service contractors, \nwhose termination plaintiffs still wish to be enjoined), nor an injunction requiring the transfer of \nUSIP headquarters back to USIP.  They narrowed their request regarding future property \ntransfers to an order prohibiting transfers of USIP assets to GSA or the Department of the \nTreasury.  Defendants timely filed their response to plaintiffs’ supplemental submission earlier \ntoday.  See Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Notice Following the Hearing on the TRO, ECF No. 22.  \nUpon consideration of the current record, the parties’ initial and supplemental \nsubmissions and arguments presented at the TRO motion hearing, plaintiffs’ motion is denied for \nthe reasons explained below.  \nI.  LEGAL STANDARD \nFor a TRO to be granted, a plaintiff must demonstrate the following: (1) the plaintiff is \nlikely to succeed on the merits of its claims; (2) the plaintiff is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nwithout the TRO; (3) the balance of the equities favors issuance of the TRO; and (4) the issuance \nof a TRO is in the public interest.  Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411, 421 (2022) (quoting Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008)).

Karem v. \nTrump, 960 F.3d 656, 668 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  \nThe likelihood of success on the merits factor is the most important, and absent such a \nshowing, relief should be denied.  See, e.g., Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr. v. U.S \nDep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 639 F.3d 1078, 1088 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (“When a plaintiff has not \nshown a likelihood of success on the merits, there is no need to consider the remaining factors.”); \nHanson v. District of Columbia, 120 F.4th 223, 242-43 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“[W]e hold [appellant] \nis not sufficiently likely to succeed on the merits of his claim to warrant the entry of \na preliminary injunction against enforcement of the [law].”). \nTo show a likelihood of success on the merits, and for the Court to have jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’ motion, plaintiff must also demonstrate that plaintiff has standing.  “In the context of” \ntemporary injunctive relief, the plaintiff must “show a substantial likelihood of standing under \nthe heightened standard for evaluating a motion for summary judgment,” thus requiring more \nthan mere allegations.  Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr. v. Presidential Advisory Comm’n on Election \nIntegrity, 878 F.3d 371, 377 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 \nF.3d 905, 912-13 (D.C. Cir. 2015)) (describing the standard for a preliminary injunction).  \nStanding requires “(1) . . . a ‘concrete and particularized’ injury (2) that is ‘fairly traceable to the \nchallenged action of the defendant’ and (3) that is ‘likely’ to be ‘redressed by a favorable \ndecision.’”  Id. at 376-77 (quoting West v. Lynch, 845 F.3d 1228, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).     \nII.  DISCUSSION \nAt the outset, the purpose of a TRO is not to decide which party will prevail or lose the \ncase.  That assessment comes later when the factual record and legal arguments of the parties are \nfully developed and the Court has time for thorough consideration.  The purpose of a TRO is to \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 5 of 14\npreserve the status quo while the merits of the case are considered.  See Nat’l Council of \nNonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, --F. Supp. 3d --, No. 25-cv-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 314433, \nat *2 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025) (citing MGU v. Nielsen, 316 F. Supp. 3d 518, 520 (D.D.C. 2018)) \n(involving a TRO); Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. \nCir. 2006) (involving a preliminary injunction).  Still, restraining parties in ongoing litigation, \neven temporarily, from going about their business requires that the party seeking the TRO meet \nthe significant thresholds for obtaining such “extraordinary” relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 24.   \nThe events at USIP over the past two months—involving sudden change of leadership, \nmass terminations of employees conducted in alphabetical order with no forewarning, the \ntransfer of USIP’s headquarters and other property, and termination of contracts and \nprogramming—undoubtedly wreaked havoc on the lives of people affiliated with USIP in \nnumerous capacities.  For plaintiffs’ TRO to be granted, however, plaintiffs must demonstrate \nthey are likely to succeed on a specific legal claim, and that claim must involve conduct by the \ndefendant that caused or will cause a cognizable injury experienced by plaintiffs that can be \nredressed by this Court through the relief requested.  The mismatch here between the harms \nexperienced by plaintiffs, the allegedly unlawful acts challenged, and the requested forms of \nrelief—even in the more limited amended order proposed by plaintiffs—forecloses such a \nfavorable conclusion in this preliminary posture.      \nFirst, plaintiffs argue that President Trump illegally removed USIP’s appointed Board \nmembers.  Pls.’ Mot. at 14; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 135-44 (Count One).  That claim has been twice \nbrought before this Court in an emergency posture and the relief denied, given the complexity \nand novelty of that claim.  See USIP v. Jackson, No. 25-cv-804, Min. Orders (Mar. 19, 2025, and \nApr. 1, 2025).  Both sides present strong arguments supporting their divergent views of the \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 6 of 14\nnature of USIP.  This is no trivial legal dispute, given the number of other entities with similar or \nanalogous structures and claims of independence from executive branch control, at least for \ncertain purposes.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Mot. at 18 (referencing Dong v. Smithsonian Institute, 125 F.3d \n877 (D.C. Cir. 1997), which held that the Smithsonian Institute is not an establishment of the \nexecutive branch for one purpose); Defs.’ Opp’n at 13 (citing Lebron v. National Railroad \nPassenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374 (1995), which held that Amtrak is part of the federal government \nfor purposes of a First Amendment claim).   \n For its part, defendants argue that USIP “is plainly an Executive Branch agency.”  Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 9.  To support this argument, defendants point out that USIP was “established” in a \nfederal statute by Congress, with its authority vested in a Board of Directors appointed by the \nPresident (including three ex officio members, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, \nand the president of the National Defense University).  Defs.’ Opp’n at 3, 10-11 (citing 22 \nU.S.C. §§ 4603(a), 4605(a)-(b)).  USIP is funded largely by Congress, 22 U.S.C. §§ 4609(a), \n4604(h), and like other federal agencies, USIP is required to publish certain notices in the \nFederal Register, id. § 4605(h)(3), is subject to Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), id. \n§ 4607(i), and its employees subject to the Federal Tort Claims Act (“FTCA”), id. § 4606(f)(1), \nand statutory provisions for federal government benefits, including, e.g., workers compensation, \ncivil service retirement, federal life insurance, and federal health insurance, id.  Defs.’ Opp’n at \n3-4, 10-11.  Further, defendants emphasize that the Office of Management and Budget has long \ndesignated USIP as a federal entity, pursuant to the Inspector General Act of 1978, Defs.’ Opp’n \nat 11-12 (citing 5 U.S.C. § 415(h)), and that other federally created entities with \nnongovernmental features, like Amtrak, have been found to be part of the government for \nconstitutional purposes, id. at 13 (citing Lebron, 513 U.S. at 399).  USIP also conducts, \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 7 of 14\ndefendants insist, core executive branch foreign policy activities—exercising “soft power to \nenhance its diplomacy and foreign relations and attempt to obviate the need for military \naction.”  Id. at 15.  By defendants’ reasoning, USIP’s Board, which is presidentially appointed, is \ntherefore subject to the President’s Article II removal authority, and because USIP exercises such \ncore executive power, as opposed to quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial authority, the narrow \nexception to the President’s constitutional authority to remove his subordinates presented by \nHumphrey’s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935) and Wiener v. United States, 357 \nU.S. 349 (1958), does not apply.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 19-21.  Thus, defendants conclude, the USIP \nAct’s limitations on the President’s unilateral power to remove USIP’s Board members are \ninvalid and void, and that the removal of USIP Board members was lawful.  \n              In contrast, plaintiffs argue that USIP is an entirely independent nonprofit corporation \nnot subject to Article II.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 15-22.  Congress established USIP as an “independent \nnonprofit corporation,” characterized it as a charitable organization under the tax code, and \nprovided that its officers and employees are not federal officers or employees except for limited \npurposes, so USIP is not a government entity, according to plaintiffs.  Pls.’ Mot. at 17 (citing 22 \nU.S.C. §§ 4603(b), 4604(a), 4606(f)(1)).  Plaintiffs acknowledged the complexity of this issue at \nthe hearing, briefly offering a theory of entities on a “continuum”  from “wholly independent \nentities” to “something like the Red Cross or Girl Scouts” to the “Department of State,” and put \nUSIP in the middle category, but plaintiffs did not offer that argument in their papers or expound \non that theory at the hearing, by, for example, explaining the statutory difference “between a \ncharter versus an establishment of an entity,” instead proposing to wait until summary judgment \nbriefing.  Rough Draft Hr’g Tr. at 93:1-94:5. Plaintiffs also reason that USIP is not part of the \nexecutive branch, in particular, and discount the fact that USIP is explicitly made subject to \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 8 of 14\nFOIA and the FTCA by contending this is necessary only because the entity is not automatically \nsubject to these laws as an executive agency.  Id.  Plaintiffs also differentiate USIP’s function \nfrom executive powers, noting that USIP does not enforce laws, issue rules, or implement any \nstatute, and does not represent the U.S. government when interacting with foreign groups.  Id. at \n17-18.   \nEven if USIP were an executive branch agency, however, plaintiffs urge that, under \nHumphrey’s Executor and Wiener, for-cause removal protections on USIP’s multimember, \npartisan-balanced Board are constitutionally permissible, especially in light of USIP’s de minimis \nexercise of executive power.  Id. at 19-22.  The President therefore violated the law when \nremoving USIP’s Board members without cause, and, as a result, plaintiffs contend, all of the \nsubsequent actions conducted by USIP’s new leadership are ultra vires and void.  See Pls.’ Mot. \nat 16, 22, 36 (“Improper removal of the board members, and all harm to Plaintiffs that flowed \nfrom those illegal actions, were ultra vires in violation of the USIP Act.”). \nGiven that briefing on the issue is ongoing in the USIP v. Jackson litigation, where Board \nmembers themselves are plaintiffs, this Court will not opine further in an emergency posture \nwith incomplete briefing on that claim here.  For the purposes of this emergency application, the \nCourt assumes that defendant Cavanaugh, who was appointed by two of the three ex officio \nBoard members remaining, Defs.’ Opp’n, Ex. 3, ECF No. 18-3, is lawfully USIP’s president.   \nSecond, regarding plaintiffs’ claim that the transfer of USIP’s property to GSA violates \nthe APA, plaintiffs lack standing.  First Am. Compl. ¶¶ 145-55 (Count Two); Pls.’ Mot. at 25-26.  \nPlaintiffs have not shown any specific injury caused by transfer of property that can be redressed \nby this Court.  See Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr., 878 F.3d at 377-78.  Plaintiffs who are former \nemployees (or soon-to-be former employees abroad) or former program partners explain that \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 9 of 14\nthey suffer injuries involving the complexities of finding healthcare and other uncertainties \nregarding financial and physical security due to sudden loss of their jobs or contracts.  See Pls.’ \nMot., Declarations, Exs. F-J, N-O.  Those circumstances will not be alleviated if USIP recoups \nits headquarters building, retains its remaining property—the only property-related relief the \nAmended Proposed Order seeks—nor will they be worsened if USIP transfers away other \nassets.1   \nWhile the donor plaintiff likely suffered harm from USIP’s disposal of its headquarters \nresulting in improper use of his dedicated donations, giving rise to a claim in contract or tort, that \nfinancial harm is not irreparable so as to warrant preliminary injunctive relief on this claim.  See \nid., Decl. of Chester Crocker, Donor ¶¶ 4-5, Ex. L, ECF No. 11-13.2  In any case, the only relief \nrequested—preventing further transfer of assets away from USIP—would not redress the donor’s \nharm.  Rather, for the donor’s interests to be effectuated—i.e., the specific purpose for his \ndonations carried out—other actors (USIP’s leadership) must make decisions, for instance about \nthe use and name of a particular conference room, that this Court cannot micromanage.  See \nHectate Energy LLC v. FERC, 126 F.4th 660, 665 (D.C. Cir. 2025) (holding that redressability \ncannot be established when it depends on future choices by third parties “whose exercise of \nbroad and legitimate discretion the courts cannot presume to either control or to predict”).     \nThird, plaintiffs argue that defendants have taken specific actions that are arbitrary and \ncapricious, unlawful, and contrary to constitutional right in an effort to shutter the agency and \ncease all of its activities, in violation of the APA.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 26-34; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 156-\n \n1   Plaintiffs’ counsel raised the concern about plaintiffs’ access to COBRA if USIP is shuttered entirely.  See \nRough Draft Hr’g Tr. at 20:14-21:12. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate, however, that dissolution of the Institute would \nresult from any further transfer of assets to GSA or the Treasury.  That harm—related to ongoing access to health \nbenefits—therefore would not be directly redressed by the relief sought. \n   \n2   The same is true for the harm suffered by a contractor who left professional video equipment in the USIP \nheadquarters.  See Pls.’ Mot., Decl. of Intermotion Media, LLC ¶ 13, Ex. N, ECF No. 11-15.   \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 10 of 14\n72 (Count Three).  Reviewing each of plaintiffs’ challenged actions, none constitutes a violation \non this record.  See Am. Compl. ¶ 163.  Regarding the termination of staff and their benefits, \nplaintiffs argue that around 300 of USIP’s 400 employees were terminated in a single day and \ndefendants announced termination of the rest in May, which amounts to an effective shutdown of \nthe Institute in violation of acts of Congress establishing USIP and requiring certain programs.  \nSee Pls.’ Mot. at 29-30; Rough Draft Hr’g Tr. at 60:18-21; 22 U.S.C. § 4603(a) (establishing the \nInstitute); Gandhi-King Scholarly Exchange Act Initiative, Pub. L. 116-260, 134 Stat. 3114 \n(2020).  Defendants, to the contrary, insist that USIP “while reduced, continues to perform \nfunctions required by statute.”  Defs.’ Opp’n at 31.  A factual dispute exists as to whether USIP \ncan do so in its current situation.  While plaintiffs raise legitimate doubts that USIP’s current \nleadership, at USIP’s current gutted staffing levels, has the expertise, resources, and partnerships \nnecessary to effectuate USIP’s statutory mission, no clear violation of its congressional \nmandates, is so far apparent.  Defendants could be hiring new staff or taking other efforts to meet \ntheir obligations.3  Nor have plaintiffs demonstrated that the mass terminations were arbitrary \nand capricious, given current leadership’s stated goals of reducing USIP to its core functions and \npromoting efficiency.  See Pls.’ Mot., Letter from Cavanaugh, Ex. C, ECF No. 11-5; Executive \nOrder 14217 (“EO 14217”) § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 10577, 10577 (Feb. 19, 2025).   \nWith respect to defendants’ abrupt cancellation of USIP contracts, see Pls.’ Mot. at 28-\n29, a recent per curiam opinion by the Supreme Court may deprive this Court of the authority to \nconsider claims sounding in contract or to enjoin further termination of contracts, even if they are \nstyled as APA claims.  In Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025), the \n \n3   At summary judgment, defendants will have to demonstrate they are in fact successfully doing so and not \nreducing USIP to a shell in name-only. \n   \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 11 of 14\nSupreme Court construed as an appealable preliminary injunction a district court order that \nenjoined the government from terminating various education-related grants after a finding of \nplaintiffs’ likelihood of success on their APA claims.  See id. at 968.  Despite acknowledging \nthat “a district court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an \nagency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds,” id. at 968 (quoting Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 (1988)), the Supreme Court nonetheless concluded that the \ndistrict court “lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA” because “the \nTucker Act grants the Court of federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on ‘any express or \nimplied contract with the United States,’” id. (quoting 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1)).  This holding \nappears in tension with the D.C. Circuit’s approach in Crowley Government Services, Inc. v. \nGSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1105-13 (D.C. Cir. 2022), but in this preliminary posture with incomplete \nbriefing presented in short form after the TRO hearing when raised by the Court, plaintiffs have \nnot sufficiently distinguished the Supreme Court’s new holding to warrant a finding of likelihood \non the merits.  See Pls.’ Notice Following Hr’g at 2.4   \nIn any case, the only relief related to contracts that plaintiffs seek is an order ceasing \nfurther termination of personal services contractors—individuals who are effectively employed \nby the Institute on a contractual basis.  See Amended Proposed Order.  Plaintiffs have not, at this \njuncture, provided specific detail about the nature of these contracts and how such an order \nwould not effectively “enforce a contractual obligation to pay money.”   Dep’t of Educ., 145 \nS.Ct. at 968.   \n \n4   Plaintiffs suggest that Department of Education v. California might be inapposite, given that USIP is an \nindependent nonprofit without sovereign immunity, 22 U.S.C. § 4604(k), and thus the Tucker Act might not apply.  \nSee Pls.’ Notice Following Hr’g at 2 n.1.  Defendants respond that “a waiver of sovereign immunity” is not the same \nas “the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction,” and “[f]or claims sounding in contract, jurisdiction generally lies \nexclusively in the United States Court of Federal Claims.”  Defs.’ Resp. to Pls.’ Notice at 2 n.1.  Regardless, in this \npreliminary posture, this Court will not decide the nature of USIP, and plaintiffs have not provided sufficient \nexplanation of the inapplicability of the Tucker Act to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits.   \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 12 of 14\nPlaintiffs also challenge the apparent dissolution of the Gandhi-King Academy, through \nthe firing of USIP’s staff tasked with work on the Academy, as arbitrary and capricious and in \nviolation of the statute requiring its formation.  Pls.’ Mot. at 34.  Yet, plaintiffs do not have \nstanding to challenge this apparent act because they lack harm directly traceable to it, as opposed \nto their individual termination or termination of specific contracts.  See Elec. Privacy Info. Ctr., \n878 F.3d at 376-77; Pls.’ Mot., Decl. of Sasha Pippenger ¶¶ 3, 10-17, Ex. F, ECF No. 11-8 \n(describing her former role on a team that was one of four components of the Gandhi King \nGlobal Academy and describing harm resulting from her termination and loss of employment \nbenefits rather than directly from dissolution of that program).  Even so, plaintiffs have not \ndemonstrated on this record that the Academy has been forever eliminated in contradiction to the \nstatutory mandate and that defendants do not have alternative plans for meeting those statutory \nrequirements.   \nPlaintiffs also refer to defendants’ shutdown of the USIP website, rendering its electronic \nresources inaccessible.  Pls.’ Mot. at 28-29; Am. Compl. ¶ 163.  Again, however, plaintiffs have \nnot demonstrated concrete or particularized harm from this action or requested any specific relief \nthat would remedy such harm.  Finally, plaintiffs refer to defendants’ threats to wind down all \nprograms and grants, Am. Compl. ¶ 163, but a threat of that sort is not a final agency action ripe \nfor this Court’s review, nor does it constitute an ultra vires act in violation of a statute.  See \nLujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed’n, 497 U.S. 871, 882 (1990).  All of these challenges to agency \nactions, therefore, are either improperly before this Court based on the particular plaintiffs suing \nand the relief requested, or not unlawful on the present record.   \nFourth, plaintiffs allege that efforts to cease all of USIP’s corporate activities are ultra \nvires, beyond defendants’ authority, and violative of the USIP Act and the Gandhi-King \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 13 of 14\nInitiative Act.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 35; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 173-76 (Count Four).  For the reasons \npreviously described, plaintiffs have not described concrete, particularized harm from all of these \nactions—apart from their individualized terminations which do not themselves violate the \nstatutes—that this Court can remedy.  Moreover, even putting all of defendants’ actions together, \nplaintiffs have not demonstrated that defendants have actually gone so far as to decimate USIP to \nmake achievement of its statutory mandates impossible.   \nFifth, plaintiffs allege a violation of separation of powers and ultra vires action because \ndefendants have violated the Take Care Clause in not carrying out the mandates of USIP’s \nstatute.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 36; Am. Compl. ¶¶ 177-83, U.S. CONST. art II, § 3.  While plaintiffs \nalso argue that President Trump violated separation of powers in flouting Congress’s removal \nprotections when terminating USIP’s Board members, that issue is only one part of this claim, \ngiven that whoever is leading USIP must carry out the USIP Act and any other congressional \nstatute guiding USIP’s purpose and activities.  See Pls.’ Mot. at 36.   To be sure, the executive \nbranch cannot unilaterally shut down USIP—that would violate the executive branch’s Take \nCare obligation to establish the entity and implement its statutory functions.  See 22 U.S.C. \n§ 4604(a) (giving USIP the powers of a D.C. nonprofit corporation, except for the power to \ndissolve itself); see also In re United Mine Workers of Am. Int’l Union, 190 F.3d 545, 551 (D.C. \nCir. 1999) (‘Needless to say, the President is without authority to set aside congressional \nlegislation by executive order.”).  The record does not support a finding, let alone demonstrate, \nhowever, that defendants have done that—at least yet.  Defendant Cavanaugh espouses a \nrelatively broad view of how USIP is required to operate, see Letter from Cavanaugh at 2, Ex. C \n(citing 22 U.S.C. § 4604(b)(1)-(10)).  If USIP can accomplish all of those statutory goals, see id., \nthe challenged actions would not violate the separation of powers in the respect of unlawfully \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 25     Filed 04/17/25     Page 14 of 14\nshuttering the Institute.  Whether USIP actually can do so remains to be seen and will be \nscrutinized at summary judgment. \nGiven plaintiffs’ failure to demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits of any of their \nclaims, no temporary injunctive relief is warranted and the other factors need not be considered.  \nSee Greater New Orleans Fair Hous. Action Ctr., 639 F.3d at 1088.   \nIII.

Civil Action No. 25-1090 (BAH) \n \nU.S. DOGE SERVICE, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \nCONSENT MOTION TO EXTEND TIME \n  Defendants respectfully move to extend by two weeks the time for them to respond to the \nplaintiffs’ motion for discovery (ECF No. 35). Defendants’ response is currently due on May 23, \n2025, and the extension would move that deadline to June 6, 2025. If this extension is granted, the \nCourt should concurrently extend the plaintiffs’ deadline to reply to June 13, 2025. Undersigned \ncounsel has conferred with counsel for the plaintiffs, and the plaintiffs consent to this motion.  \n  There is good cause for the extension.

No. 25-0804-BAH (D.D.C.). Among other things, the Court \ndeclared that the “removal of members of the Board of Directors of the United States Institute of \nPeace (‘USIP’) . . . was unlawful” and that “all actions taken or authorized by Kenneth Jackson or \nNate Cavanaugh as acting presidents of USIP were invalid and therefor null, void, and without \nlegal effect.” Order (R.39) at 2. The plaintiffs in this case seek similar relief. \nThe extension requested will allow the defendants the necessary time to assess the impact \nof the Court’s decision and reasoning in USIP on the motion for discovery in this case, as well as \nits implications on this case more broadly. Moreover, undersigned counsel, who is primarily \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 37     Filed 05/20/25     Page 2 of 3\nresponsible for the government’s response to the discovery motion, will have limited time to assess \nthe impact of the USIP decision this week because he was responsible for drafting a response to a \npreliminary injunction motion that was filed on May 19, 2025, and for a hearing on that motion to \nbe held on May 23, 2025.  \n  Pursuant to paragraph 8.d of the Court’s standing order (ECF No. 14), the defendants \nprovide the following explanation as to why this motion does not comply with the Court’s “four-\nday rule” for motions to extend. The Court issued its decision in the USIP case on May 19, already \nonly four days from the deadline for defendants’ response to the motion for discovery. Counsel for \ndefendants immediately conferred with counsel for plaintiffs that same day about a motion to stay \nor extend briefing on the discovery motion to assess the impact of the USIP decision, but counsel \nfor plaintiffs advised that he would be unable to provide a position until the following day (today), \nafter he had an opportunity to confer with his clients. After counsel had an opportunity to speak \nwith his clients, counsel for both sides spoke further by telephone today. Therefore, despite \ndiligence, the defendants were unable to complete the conference requirement of Local Rule 7(m) \nuntil today. The government filed this motion immediately thereafter. \n \n*  *  * \n   \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01090-BAH     Document 37     Filed 05/20/25     Page 3 of 3\n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant this motion and extend defendants’ \ndeadline to respond to the discovery motion to June 6, 2025. \n \nDated: May 20, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nJEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nUnited States Attorney \n   \nBy:  /s/ \nJOHNNY H.
