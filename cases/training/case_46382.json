    "summary": "<p>This lawsuit involves a challenge to New Mexico state practices in processing and censoring prison mail. On October 25, 2024, the Human Rights Defense Center sued several parties connected to or responsible for New Mexico prison policies and practices: the Governor of New Mexico; the Cabinet Secretary and two Deputy Secretaries of the New Mexico Corrections Department; the Chief Executive Officer and President/Chief Operating Officer of The GEO Group, Inc., a private company which operates at least one correctional facility in the state; and several anonymous John and Jane Does and entities, presently unknown to the plaintiff but who were agents of New Mexico and were involved in the adoption and/or implementation of the alleged state policies at issue.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff is a nonprofit organization which distributes material to incarcerated persons in all U.S. states. The material that plaintiff publishes and sends out includes news and analysis of prisons and other detention facilities, information about the rights of incarcerated persons, and/or political and social commentary. Plaintiff mailed out such material to individuals incarcerated in New Mexico, both in facilities operated directly by the state and those operated by private companies on behalf of the state.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff&rsquo;s complaint set forth that a December 2021 state memorandum announced that (1) personal mail would no longer be accepted at state-run prison facilities, and required that personal mail be sent to a third party for processing; and (2) that privately-operated facilities would continue to accept personal mail. After the release of that memorandum, defendant released the most recent version of its Mail Policy, dated April 8, 2022. Plaintiff alleged that defendant&rsquo;s Mail Policy, which laid out policies and practices for the rejection of certain mail items, enclosures, or packages sent to inmates, were unconstitutional on its face, and were unduly broad and vague.</p>\r\n<p>In particular, plaintiff alleged that the defendants&rsquo; Mail Policy raised several concerns: (1) it laid out overly broad grounds on which mail could be rejected, (2) did not provide any requirement for notice of censorship to the party who sent in the rejected mail, and (3) did not provide any appeals process by which senders of challenged mail could challenge the decision to reject the mail at issue.</p>\r\n<p>In accordance with that Mail Policy, plaintiff alleged that defendants had censored books, magazines, and other correspondence it had sent to incarcerated individuals in New Mexico since at least March 2022. Plaintiff noted that it had independently identified at least 152 instances where its mail had not been delivered to the intended recipients and were returned to sender. Plaintiff alleged that it believed numerous other mailings it had sent had been censored or are actively being censored. Because of Mail Policy provisions, plaintiff stated that they were not provided any opportunity to appeal the decision to refuse to deliver, and did not receive notice of the reason that their publications and mail were rejected.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff laid out the following claims: (1) Defendants&rsquo; conduct violates the First Amendment, by censoring plaintiff&rsquo;s freedom of speech and expression and chilling future speech and expression for the incarcerated. (2) Defendants violated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as plaintiff had constitutionally-protected liberty interests in communicating with the incarcerated, and due process rights to receive notice and opportunity to appeal defendants&rsquo; decisions to interfere with those interests, which defendants violated. For these claims, plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, to enjoin defendants from continuing the mail practices at issue, as well as damages.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On October 25, 2024, plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary injunction, seeking to enjoin defendants from continuing to use and enforce current mail practices.</p>\r\n<p>The case was originally assigned to Judge Jennifer M. Rozzoni and later reassigned to U.S. District Judge Marget I. Strickland.</p>\r\n<p>On December 20, 2024, one defendant (the Governor of New Mexico) filed a motion to dismiss. The defendant argued that the complaint did not provide a cause of action against the Governor either individually or in her official role, and that plaintiff had not pled that the defendant was responsible for any act or omission which caused plaintiff harm. While the Governor holds a supervisory role over the New Mexico Department of Corrections and has a general duty to enforce state law, the defendant argued that the Governor cannot be held liable in a civil rights action if her only involvement was the fact that she had a supervisory role.</p>\r\n<p>On January 10, 2025, the two private defendants (the CEO and President/COO of The GEO Group, Inc.) also filed a motion to dismiss. In their motion, the defendants argued lack of personal jurisdiction. They claimed that they lacked the necessary minimum contacts with the state of New Mexico for jurisdiction to be exercised over them, and that they are high-level corporate executives at The Geo Group, Inc., who had no involvement with the challenged policies in this action.</p>\r\n<p>As of April 14, 2025, the court had not issued a decision, nor have significant developments occurred. The case is actively being litigated, and pending future updates.</p>",

Not all of NMDCโs written policies, procedures, or practices are available \nonline.  HRDC obtained a memorandum dated December 29, 2021, addressed to \nโOffender Familiesโ from NMCD, with the subject line โRe: Inmate Mail Changes.โ  The \nmemorandum is not signed by any individual but is on NMCD letterhead bearing the \nnames of Defendant LUJAN GRISHAM, Governor, and Defendant TAFOYA LUCERO, \nCabinet Secretary.  The memorandum announced that beginning February 1, 2022, \nโpersonal mail will no longer be accepted at state-run prison facilitiesโ and it lays out a \nprocess for sending personal mail to a third party for processing.  The memorandum \nnotes that LCCF and OCPF, the two privately operated facilities, โwill continue to accept \npersonal mail.โ  The memorandum does not define โpersonal mailโ or announce any \nchanges about how publications mailed by a publisher or vendor will be treated.  \nHandling of publications mailed by a publisher or vendor is a topic covered in the Mail \nPolicy.  Both the current Mail Policy and the prior April 8, 2022 Mail Policy postdate the \nmemorandum. \n31.  Defendantsโ current Mail Policy attaches blank copies of Defendantsโ Mail \nRejection form (CD-151201.1) and the Publication Review Panel Determination (CD-\n151201.4) and also provides the following policies and procedures in pertinent part: \nC.

Junk mail, pamphlets, leaflets, brochures, etc., will be judged by the same \nstandards  as  other  correspondence;  however,  any  incoming  mail  not \naddressed to an inmate may be discarded at the discretion of prison officials. \nโฆ \nE.

Hardbound publications are prohibited. \n3.  Items  will  not  be  rejected  solely  because  content  is  religious, \nphilosophical, political, social, sexual, unpopular or repugnant. \nโฆ \n7. When mail items, enclosures, or packages are rejected the inmate and the \nsender will be notified in writing on the Mail Rejection form (CD-151201.1) \nwith the reason for the rejection indicated. [5-ACI-7D-05] \n8. Rejected outgoing mail shall be withheld, photocopied and filed for future \nreference, prior to return or destruction. \n9. Rejection of publications will require review by the publication review \n   14   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 15 of 27\n \npanel, consisting of three staff members designated by the Deputy Director \nof Adult Prisons. The panel will determine whether the rejection is necessary \nand  whether  the  rejected  material  poses  a  security  risk  detrimental  to \npenological interest. \n10.  Rejection  of  publications  will  be  made  on  an  individual  basis. \nSubscription based publications will not be placed on a permanent excluded \nlist and shall be reviewed as to each individual subscription issue and rejected \non each individual issue. \n11.

Rejections of any mail, enclosure or publication that an inmate claims to \nbe religious should be reviewed by NMCD legal counsel. \n13. Any inmate whose mail, enclosure, package or publication is rejected \nmay contest the rejection through the inmate grievance procedure. \n32.  Defendantsโ Mail Policy is unconstitutional on its face and as applied, and \nis unduly broad and vague.  This is especially true because the books and magazines \npublished and/or distributed by HRDC cover topics of great public concern and contain \ncore protected speech, including political speech and social commentary, and educational \ninformation relating to the rights of incarcerated persons, pertinent legal cases, and \nincarcerated personsโ health and safety, and are thus entitled to the highest protection \nafforded by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.   \n33.  The grounds whereby Defendants may reject mailed publications listed in \nDefendantsโ Mail Policy are overly broad and/or too vague for a sender to understand \nwhat is prohibited and what is permissible.  \n34.  Defendantsโ Mail Policy also does not clearly provide any requirement for \nnotice of censorship to the senders of publications.  Although the Mail Policy requires \nsuch notice for โmail items, enclosures, or packagesโ provided via the Mail Rejection \n   15   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 16 of 27\n \nform (CD-151201.1), the process for publications requires notice only to the intended \nrecipient and not the sender as follows:  โWhen publications are rejected, the inmate will \nbe notified in writing on the Publication Review Panel Determination form (CD-\n151201.4).โ \n35.  Additionally, while Defendantsโ Mail Policy provides โAny inmate whose \nmail, enclosure, package or publication is rejected may contest the rejection through the \ninmate grievance procedureโ it does not provide for any appeals process by which a \nsender such as HRDC may challenge a decision by Defendants to reject publications or \nother mailings for delivery to incarcerated persons at Defendantsโ prisons. \n36.  The prior versions of Defendantsโ Mail Policyโthe April 8, 2022 Mail \nPolicy and the February 23, 2015 Mail Policyโreflect various changes to the relevant \npolicies and procedures over time.  Neither of these policies is any clearer or more \nprotective of HRDCโs constitutional rights to free speech and due process at issue here. \n37.  Defendantsโ non-public written policy or procedure in the December 29, \n2021 memorandum is likewise unconstitutional to the extent it was or is being applied to \npublishers distributors such as HRDC.  That policy provides that โ[a]t all private and \nstate-run facilities moving forward, mail will no longer be accepted that is comprised of \ncardboard or other rigid parchment incapable of running through the scanner.  For \nexample, USPS postal rigid express envelopes that lay flat but do not bend without \ncreasing would not be accepted and magazines will not be accepted.โ \n38.  From at least March 2022 to the present, Defendants have been censoring \nbooks, magazines and other correspondence mailed by HRDC to incarcerated persons \n   16   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 17 of 27\n \nheld in custody in Defendantsโ prisons by refusing to deliver the publications and \ncorrespondence to the intended recipients, and by returning the items to HRDCโs office \nvia the Return to Sender service of the United States Postal Service, at Plaintiffโs \nexpense.  Since at least February 2022, subscribers have been writing to HRDC to \ncomplain of censorship, although HRDC did not begin to receive returned items until \nMarch 2022.   \n39.  HRDC has identified at least one hundred fifty-two (152) instances in the \nperiod from February 2022 through September 2024 where publications and \ncorrespondence that HRDC mailed to incarcerated persons, individually addressed and \nseparately mailed with postage fully paid, were not delivered to intended recipients who \nwere still incarcerated at Defendantsโ prisons when the items arrived in the mail, and \nwere instead returned to sender.  This includes at least 139 items sent to individuals at \nfour of the eight NMCD facilities operated by the stateโnamely SNMCF, PNM, \nNENMCF, and CNMCFโplus at least 13 additional items sent to individuals at the \nLCCF operated by Defendant GEO.  This includes at least seventy-three (73) issues of \nPrison Legal News, forty-eight (48) issues of Criminal Legal News, twenty (20) copies of \nthe book PYHS, nine (9) copies of HRDCโs Annual Reports, one (1) copy of the book The \nPLRA Handbook, and one (1) renewal letter sent to a subscriber.  Each of these items was \nnot delivered to the intended recipient at Defendantsโ prisons, and was instead returned to \nHRDCโs office by Defendants using the Return to Sender service of the United States \nPostal Service.  For each of these instances, HRDC staff confirmed that the intended \nrecipient was still incarcerated with the Department at the time that the mailing was \n   17   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 18 of 27\n \nreturned to HRDC via the Return to Sender service.  In the each of these cases HRDC \nstaff confirmed via NMCDโs public โOffender Searchโ service that the intended recipient \nwas still in custody and housed at the same facility to which the mail had been sent. \n40.  HRDC is informed and believes that numerous additional publications and \ncorrespondence mailed to persons incarcerated at the NMCD have been censored by \nDefendants and are being censored on an ongoing basis.  HRDC has mailed over 1,000 \nindividual copies of its monthly Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News magazines \nto NMCD subscribers during the relevant timeframe all of which presumably arrived in \nthe mail as addressed even though HRDC has only received a fraction of those magazines \nreturned to sender.  At the same time, HRDC has received dozens of letters from \nincarcerated persons complaining of censorship, some of whom enclosed rejection \nnotices asserting that newspapers and magazines are prohibited.   \n41.  The publications and correspondence that Defendants refused to deliver  \nwere returned to Plaintiff with various vague markings including ink stamps and/or \nhandwritten markings crossing out portions of the mailing address, either no other \nmarkings, or with various combinations of crude handwritten notations such as โRTS,โ \nโREF,โ โRefused,โ and/or โDenied,โ with one case noting โNOT AUTHORIZED,โ one \ncase noting โNewspapers/Magazines Prohibited,โ one case noting โMagazines Not \nAllowed Nor Newspapersโ one case incorrectly indicating โPostage Due,โ and in one \nother case affixing a label stating only โREFUSED VIOLATES DOC MAIL RULE.โ   \n42.  Although Defendantsโ Mail Policy provides generally that โInmates will \nhave access to publicationsโ Defendants nonetheless refused to deliver twenty-one (21) \n   18   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 19 of 27\n \nsoft-cover books mailed by HRDC to incarcerated persons at NMCD facilitiesโ\nincluding one (1) copy of the PLRA Handbook marked as โNOT AUTHORIZED.โ  The \nremaining twenty (20) books were copies of PYHS.  Of these, four (4) were returned with \nno markings at all other than crossing out the mailing address, another eight (8) were \nreturned with the markings โDenied Refusedโ handwritten in ink on the outside of the \nmailing package, another seven (7) were returned with the handwritten abbreviation \nโRTSโ on the outside of the mailing package including one instance with additional \nmarkings on the edges of the package โx 1150โ and โ1150โ and another instance with the \nadditional handwritten markings โKeyโ and an arrow pointing toward the marking \nโRTS.โ  None of these returned books included any information as to why Defendants \nrefused to deliver them to the intended recipients.  The remaining one (1) book was \nreturned with the handwritten marking โPostage Dueโ despite being properly addressed \nand metered and apparently delivered to the institution, and included no other \ninformation as to why Defendants refused to deliver it to the intended recipient.   \n43.  Defendants also refused to deliver at least one hundred and twenty-one \n(121) issues of HRDCโs monthly magazines and nine (9) Annual Report booklets to \nincarcerated persons.  One (1) of these had no markings other than handwritten markings \ncrossing out the mailing address.  One (1) was marked โNewspapers/Magazines \nProhibited,โ one (1) was marked โMagazines Not Allowed Nor Newspapers.โ  The vast \nmajority included one or more of the handwritten notations โRTSโ and โREFโ and/or one \nof two ink stamps.  The first ink stamp consisted of the phrase โRETURN TO SENDERโ \nnext to an image of a hand pointing to the left, but without any other information \n   19   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 20 of 27\n \nprovided.  The other ink stamp consisted of the phrase โRETURN TO SENDERโ inside \nan image of a hand pointing to the left with the marking โINIT ___โ to the right of the \nhand, followed by five short statements with checkboxes directly underneath which read \nas follows with the โNo Longer Hereโ checkbox marked by hand: \nโก NMCD # \nโก No Longer Here \nโก Paroled  \nโก Discharged \nโก Unauthorized Content \nIn nine (9) of the instances HRDC received United States Postal Service return cards with \nboth scans of handwritten notations by Defendants and typed notations that appear to \nhave been generated by the Postal Service rather than Defendants.  The return card \nnotations included โUnable to Forward,โ Not Deliverable as Addressedโ or โRefused.โ  \nDefendants provided no other information as to the basis for their decision to refuse to \ndeliver the monthly magazines and Annual Report booklets to their intended recipients. \n44.  Defendants refused to deliver one (1) renewal letter mailed by HRDC to a \nperson incarcerated at NMCD.  The letter was returned with a label on the front of the \nmailing envelope stating โREFUSED VIOLATES DOC MAIL RULEโ and with a stamp \non the back of the mailing envelope with six check-boxes and accompanying phrases.  \nOne of the checkboxes was marked next to the phrase โLEGAL/PRIVILEGED.โ  The \nreturn did not include any information as to which rule was allegedly violated and \ncontained no other information as to why Defendants refused to deliver the letter to the \n   20   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 21 of 27\n \nintended recipient. \n45.  On December 15, 2022, HRDC received a letter on NMCD letterhead \nsigned by staff at the Penitentiary of New Mexico Mailroom stating, in totality: โTo \nwhom it may concern, Inmates at the Penitentiary of New Mexico are not allowed to have \nany Publications.โ  This letter was not tied to any specific censorship decisions and \nprovided no opportunity to appeal those decisions.   \n46.  Defendants did not provide HRDC with notice or opportunity to appeal the \ncensorship decisions in any of the instances where Defendants refused to deliver its \npublications and correspondence mailed to persons incarcerated at the Departmentโs \nfacilities.  HRDC has not been informed and is not aware of any review by a โpublication \nreview panel, consisting of three staff members designated by the Deputy Director of \nAdult Prisonsโ for the censored items, as is required by the Mail Policy โas to each \nindividual subscription issueโ that is censored.  Defendants did not provide HRDC with \nnotice of the reason any mailing was rejected beyond vague markings on the outside of \nitems returned via the United States Postal Serviceโs Return to Sender service.  Nowhere \non the returned items of mail was notice provided of a right to challenge the censorship \ndecision, or any information on whether or how HRDC could appeal Defendantsโ \nrejection of the items of mail.  In each instance of censorship, Defendants also did not \nprovide HRDC any opportunity to appeal the decision to refuse to deliver the publication \nor correspondence to the intended recipient.  Nor, as discussed above, does Defendantsโ \ncurrent Mail Policy provide for a clear requirement to notify senders of censored \npublications or provide for any appeals process by which a sender may challenge a \n   21   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 22 of 27\n \ncensorship decision.  Even after HRDC contacted Defendants NMCD and TAFOYA \nLUCERO regarding the censorship and violation of its right to due process, Defendants \ndid not provide any notice of the reason(s) for the rejections of HRDCโs mailings or an \nopportunity to appeal the censorship decisions. \n47.  Defendantsโ conduct prohibiting or not delivering HRDCโs mailed \npublications and correspondence to persons incarcerated at NMCD violates the First \nAmendment by censoring HRDCโs freedom of speech and expression, and has a chilling \neffect on future speech and expression directed at the persons incarcerated at NMCD. \n48.  HRDC will continue to mail books, magazines, and other correspondence \nto subscribers, customers, and other persons incarcerated at NMCD. \n49.  The accommodation of the free speech, free expression, and due process \nrights of HRDC will not have any significant impact on NMCDโs staff, other incarcerated \npersons at the Department, Defendantsโ allocation of resources, or security at the \nDepartmentโs facilities. \n50.  Due to Defendantsโ actions as described above, HRDC has suffered \ndamages, and will continue to suffer damages, including, but not limited to:  the \nsuppression of HRDCโs speech and press; the impediment of HRDCโs ability to \ndisseminate its political message; frustration of HRDCโs non-profit organizational \nmission; diversion of resources; the loss of potential subscribers and customers; an \ninability to recruit new subscribers and supporters; the loss of reputation; and the cost of \nprinting, handling, mailing, and staff time, among other damages. \n51.  The individual Defendantsโ actions and inactions were and are undertaken \n   22   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 23 of 27\n \nwith reckless disregard for Plaintiffโs rights and/or motivated by ill motive and intent, and \nwere and are all committed under color of law with deliberate indifference to HRDCโs \nrights. \n52.  Defendants are responsible for or personally participated in creating and \nimplementing these unconstitutional policies, practices, and customs, or for ratifying or \nadopting them.  Further, the individual Defendants are responsible for training and/or \nsupervising the staff persons whose conduct has injured and continues to injure HRDC. \n53.  Defendantsโ unconstitutional policy, practices, and customs are ongoing, \ncontinue to violate HRDCโs rights, and were and are the moving force behind the injuries \nHRDC suffered as a direct result of the constitutional violations.  As such, HRDC has no \nadequate remedy at law. \n54.  Plaintiff is entitled to injunctive relief prohibiting Defendants from refusing \nto deliver or refusing to allow delivery of publications and correspondence mailed by \nHRDC to incarcerated persons at NMCD, and prohibiting Defendants from censoring \nmail without due process of law. \nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violations of the First Amendment (Free Speech)โ42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n \n55.  HRDC re-alleges and incorporates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through \n54 of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n56.  Defendantsโ acts described above constitute violations of HRDCโs right to \ncommunicate with persons incarcerated at NMCD under the First Amendment to the \nUnited States Constitution. \n   23   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 24 of 27\n \n57.  Defendantsโ conduct was objectively unreasonable and was undertaken \nrecklessly, intentionally, willfully, with malice, and with deliberate indifference to the \nrights of others. \n58.  HRDCโs injuries and the violations of its constitutional rights were directly \nand proximately caused by Defendantsโ policies, practices, and customs, which were and \nare the moving force of the violations. \n59.  Defendantsโ acts described above have caused damages to HRDC, and if \nnot enjoined, will continue to cause damage to HRDC. \n60.  HRDC seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and nominal and \ncompensatory damages against all Defendants.  HRDC also seeks punitive damages \nsolely against the individual Defendants in their individual capacities. \nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF \n(Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Due Process)โ42 U.S.C. ยง 1983) \n \n61.  HRDC re-alleges and incorporates the allegations of paragraphs 1 through \n60 of the Complaint as if fully set forth herein. \n62.  HRDC has a constitutionally-protected liberty interest in communicating \nwith persons incarcerated at NMCD by sending publications and correspondence to them \nvia the United States Postal Service, a right clearly established under existing case law. \n63.  HRDC has the right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to receive notice and an opportunity to object and/or appeal Defendantsโ \ndecisions to prevent the publications and correspondence mailed by HRDC from reaching \nthe intended recipients incarcerated at NMCD. \n   24   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 25 of 27\n \n64.  Defendants have failed to give HRDC sufficient notice of the censorship of \nits publications and correspondence, and an opportunity to be heard with respect to that \ncensorship.  In doing so, Defendants have deprived and continue to deprive HRDC of \nliberty and property without due process of law, in violation of the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n65.  Defendantsโ conduct was objectively unreasonable and was undertaken \nrecklessly, intentionally, willfully, with malice, and with deliberate indifference to the \nrights of others. \n66.  HRDCโs injuries and the violations of its constitutional rights were directly \nand proximately caused by Defendantsโ policies, practices, and customs, which were and \nare the moving force of the violations. \n67.  Defendantsโ acts described above have caused damages to HRDC, and if \nnot enjoined, will continue to cause damage to HRDC. \n68.  HRDC seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and nominal and \ncompensatory damages against all Defendants.  HRDC also seeks punitive damages \nsolely against the individual Defendants in their individual capacities. \nREQUEST FOR RELIEF  \nWHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests relief as follows: \n1.  A declaration that Defendantsโ policies, practices, and customs violate the \nFirst and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; \n2.  A preliminary and permanent injunction preventing Defendants and their \nemployees, agents, and any and all persons acting in concert with them from further \n   25   \n[4544179.8]\nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES \n \n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 1     Filed 10/25/24     Page 26 of 27\n \nviolation of HRDCโs civil rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the \nUnited States Constitution; and providing other equitable relief; \n3.  Nominal damages for each violation of HRDCโs rights by the Defendants; \n4.  Compensatory damages in an amount to be proved at trial; \n5.  Punitive damages against the individual Defendants in an amount to be \nproved at trial; \n6.  Costs, including reasonable attorneysโ fees, under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988 and \nunder other applicable law; and \n7.

Calabrese,\nby and through their attorneys of record, YLAW, P.C. (Michael S. Jahner), hereby move to dismiss\nthe Complaint for lack of personal jurisdiction. As grounds for their Motion, Defendants Evans\nand Calabrese state as follows.\n1\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 2 of 12\nI. Background and Introduction\nPlaintiff Human Rights Defense Center (โHRDCโ), a foreign not-for-profit organization,\npublishes and distributes various books, magazines, and other materials concerning prisons and\nthe rights of incarcerated persons.  (Complaint [doc. 1] at ยถ 8.). HRDC sends publications through\nthe mail to prisoners. (Id. ยถ 22). The New Mexico Corrections Department (โNMCDโ) has adopted\npolicies and procedures that govern inmate correspondence and mail. (Id. ยถยถ 29-31). HRDC\ncontends NMCDโs mail policy is unconstitutional for a wide variety of reasons, including that it is\noverly  broad  and/or  too  vague  for  a  sender  to  understand  what  is  prohibited  and  what  is\npermissible, that it does not clearly provide any requirements for notifying senders that their\npublications have been censored, and that it lacks a mechanism by which senders may contest the\nrejection of a publication. (Id. at ยถยถ 32-37). \nHRDC filed suit on October 25, 2024, asserting claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 for\nviolation of the First Amendment (Free Speech) and Fourteenth Amendment (Due Process) against\nGovernor Michelle Lujan Grisham, NMCD Secretary Alisha Tafoya Lucero, NMCD Deputy\nSecretary Melanie Martinez, and NMCD Deputy Secretary Gary Maciel. (See generally, id.).\nHRDC has also asserted these claims against The GEO Group, Inc. (โGEOโ), GEOโs Chief\nExecutive Officer and GEOโs President and Chief Operating Officer. \nGEO is a foreign for-profit corporation organized under the laws of the State of Florida\nwith its principal place of business in the State of Florida. (Ex. A, Affidavit of Brian Evans, at pgh.\n2; Ex. B, Affidavit of Wayne Calabrese, at pgh. 2). GEO plays a very limited role in housing\nNMCDโs inmate population. There are ten (10) adult correctional facilities in the State of New\nMexico. (Complaint [doc. 1] at ยถ 10). GEO is involved in the operation of only one of those ten\nfacilities: the Lea County Correctional Facility (โLCCFโ) in Hobbs. (Ex. A to GEOโs Response in\n2\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 3 of 12\nOpposition to Plaintiffโs Motion for Preliminary Injunction [doc. 19-1] at pp. 1-2). GEO does not\ncontract directly with NMCD but is nevertheless contractually obligated to adhere to NMCDโs\npolicies and procedures, including its policies and procedures governing inmate correspondence\nand mail. (Id.). GEOโs employees at LCCF are, accordingly, required to follow NMCDโs mail and\ncorrespondence policies. (Id.; Ex. D to GEOโs Response in Opposition to Plaintiffโs Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction [doc. 19-4] at pp. 1-2). They are not permitted to deviate from those\npolicies. (Id.). \nHRDC has named GEOโs Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer as parties-\nDefendants in this case for no discernible or legitimate reason. Mr. Evans and Mr. Calabrese lack\nthe requisite minimum contacts with New Mexico, and the Court cannot exercise personal\njurisdiction over them without offending traditional notions of fair play and justice. Based on the\nforegoing, and as discussed further herein, this Court should dismiss HRDCโs Complaint as against\nMr. Evans and Mr. Calabrese.1 \nII. Applicable Legal Standard\nA motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(2) challenges the existence of\npersonal  jurisdiction.  โWhere  a  defendant  raises  a  timely  challenge  contesting  personal\njurisdiction, the plaintiff bears the burden of establishing that there is personal jurisdiction over the\ndefendant  and  that  the  exercise  of  personal  jurisdiction  would  not  violate  due-process\nrequirements.โ Resource Assoc., Grant Writing & Eval. Servs. v. Southampton Union Free Sch.\nDist., 193 F. Supp. 3d 1200, 1219 (D.N.M. 2016). The court takes as true โall well-pled (that is,\nplausible, non-conclusory, and non-speculative) factsโ alleged in the complaint, unless they are\ncontested by affidavit or other written materials. Dudnikov v. Chalk & Vermilion Fine Arts, 514\nF.3d 1063, 1070 (10th Cir. 2008); Schrader v. Biddinger, 633 F.3d 1235, 1248 (10th Cir. 2011)\n                                                \n1 HRDC opposes the relief sought in the Motion. See D.N.M.LR-Civ. 7.1(a).\n3\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 4 of 12\n(โ[E]ven well-pleaded jurisdictional allegations are not accepted as true once they are controverted\nby affidavit,โ which may in turn be contradicted by โspecific averments, verified allegations, or\nother evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of fact.โ). โWhen . . . a defendant presents\ncredible evidence through affidavits or other materials suggesting the lack of personal jurisdiction,\nthe plaintiff must come forward with sufficient evidence to create a genuine dispute of material\nfact on the issue.โ Clark v. Meijer, Inc., 376 F. Supp. 2d 1077, 1082 (D.N.M. 2004).\nIn a federal-question case like this one, personal jurisdiction over a defendant turns on two\nquestions: โ(1) whether the applicable statute potentially confers jurisdiction by authorizing\nservice of process on the defendant and (2) whether the exercise of jurisdiction comports with\n[constitutional] due process.โ Klein v. Cornelius, 786 F.3d 1310, 1317 (10th Cir. 2015) (quoting\nPeay v. BellSouth Med. Assistance Plan, 205 F.3d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 2000)). The applicable\nstatute here, 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, does not include any provisions for service of process. Trujillo v.\nWilliams, 465 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir. 2006). Thus, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(k)(1)(A)\ndirects the court โto apply the law of the state in which the district court sits.โ Id. (โBecause 42\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 does not, by itself, confer nationwide service of process or jurisdiction upon federal\ndistrict courts to adjudicate claims, Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A) refers us to the New Mexico long-\narm statute, which is coextensive with constitutional limitations imposed by the Due Process\nClause.โ).\nNew Mexicoโs long-arm statute โextends the jurisdictional reach of New Mexico courts as\nfar as constitutionally permissible.โ Tercero v. Roman Catholic Diocese, 2002-NMSC-018, ยถ 6,\n132 N.M. 312, 48 P.3d 50; NMSA 1978, ยง 38-1-16. Therefore, the statutory inquiry collapses into\nthe constitutional analysis, Anzures v. Flagship Rest. Grp., 819 F.3d 1277, 1279 (10th Cir. 2016),\n4\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 5 of 12\nand the Court โneed not conduct a statutory analysis apart from the due process analysis.โ Marcus\nFood Co. v. DiPanfilo, 671 F.3d 1159, 1166 (10th Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nโThe Due Process Clause permits the exercise of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident\ndefendant โso long as there exist minimum contacts between the defendant and the forum State.โโ\nIntercon, Inc. v. Bell Atlantic Internet Solutions, Inc., 205 F.3d 1244, 1247 (10th Cir. 2000)\n(quoting World-Wide Volkswagon Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291 (1980)). Additionally, the\ndue process analysis requires the court to ensure that that exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant\nโdoes not offend โtraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.โโ Marcus Food Co., 671\nF.3d at 1167 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagon Corp, 444 U.S. at 292).\nThe  โminimum  contactsโ  standard  may  be  met  by  establishing  general  or  specific\njurisdiction. Intercon, 205 F.3d at 1247. General jurisdiction requires โaffiliations with the State\n[that] are so โcontinuous and systematicโ as to render [the defendant] essentially at home in the\nforum State.โ Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 139 (2014); Old Republic Ins. Co. v. Contโl\nMotors, Inc., 877 F.3d 895, 904 (10th Cir. 2017) (โBecause general jurisdiction is not related to\nthe events giving rise to the suit, courts impose a more stringent minimum contacts test, requiring\nthe plaintiff to demonstrate the defendant's continuous and systematic general business contacts.โ).\nโSpecific jurisdiction, on the other hand, is premised on something of a quid pro quo: in\nexchange for โbenefittingโ from some purposive conduct directed at the forum state, a party is\ndeemed to consent to the exercise of jurisdiction for claims related to those contacts.โ Dudnikov,\n514 F.3d at 1078. Specific jurisdiction is established if (1) the defendant purposefully directed its\nactivities at residents of the forum state, and (2) the plaintiff's injuries arise out of the defendant's\nforum-related activities. Old Republic Ins. Co., 877 F.3d at 904. \n5\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 6 of 12\nAs to traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, the Court must consider (1) the\nburden on the defendant, (2) the forum stateโs interests in resolving the dispute, (3) the plaintiffโs\ninterest in receiving convenient and effectual relief, (4) the interstate judicial systemโs interest in\nobtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and (5) the shared interest of the several\nstates in furthering fundamental social policies. Marcus Food Co., 671 F.3d at 1167.\nIII. Argument and Authority\nThe question for this Court in assessing this Motion is whether due process is offended by\nthe exercise of jurisdiction over two high-ranking corporate officers who have no personal ties to\nthe State of New Mexico. See Zavala v. El Paso Cnty. Hosp. Dist., 2007-NMCA-149, ยถ 10, 172\nP.3d 173, 178 (court focuses on โwhether [defendants] had the requisite minimum contacts with\nNew Mexico to satisfy due process.โ); see also M.R. v. SereniCare Funeral Home, L.L.C., 2013-\nNMCA-022, ยถ 8, 296 P.3d 492 (court โundertake[s] a single search for the outer limits of what due\nprocess permits.โ) (citation and internal quotes omitted). Because GEOโs corporate officers lack\nsufficient minimum contacts with New Mexico and because the exercise of jurisdiction offends\ntraditional notions of fair play and justice, the Motion to Dismiss should be granted.\nA. GEOโs Corporate Executives Lack Minimum Contacts with New Mexico.\nGEO is a private, for-profit corporation incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida\nand with its principal place of business in Boca Raton, Florida. (Ex. A, Affidavit of Brian Evans,\nat pgh 2). When the Complaint was filed, Bryan Evans was the Chief Executive Officer of GEO.\n(Complaint [doc. 1] at ยถ 14). Wayne Calabrese is the President and Chief Operating Officer of\nGEO. (Id. ยถ 15). Mr. Evans and Mr. Calabrese (hereinafter the โGEO Officersโ) were served via\nfirst class United States Postal Service mail at GEOโs corporate offices located at 4955 Technology\nWay, Boca Raton, Florida on December 4, 2024. (Returns of Service [docs. 21, 22]).\n6\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 7 of 12\nTo establish general jurisdiction over the GEO Officers, HRDC must show that their\npresence in New Mexico is so โcontinuous and systematicโ that they are essentially โat homeโ in\nNew Mexico. โFor an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the\nindividual's domicile.โ See Daimler AG, 571 U.S. at 137 (internal quotation marks and citation\nomitted)). โ[A] person acquires domicile in a state when the person resides there and intends to\nremain there indefinitely.โ Middleton v. Stephenson, 749 F.3d 1197, 1200 (10th Cir. 2014)\nโDomicile is not necessarily synonymous with residence, and one can reside in one place but be\ndomiciled in another. For adults, domicile is established by physical presence in a place in connection\nwith a certain state of mind concerning oneโs intent to remain there.โ Mississippi Band of Choctaw\nIndians v. Holyfield, 490 U.S. 30, 48 (1989) (internal quotations and citations omitted). \nThe GEO Officers are domiciled in Florida; both of them live in the State of Florida. (Ex.\nA, pgh. 4; Ex. B, pgh. 4). Neither of the GEO Officers lives in New Mexico or plans to relocate to\nNew Mexico. (Ex. A, pgh. 5; Ex. B, pgh. 5). Neither of the GEO Officers works in New Mexico.\n(Ex. A, pgh. 6; Ex. B, pgh. 6). Neither of the GEO Officers owns any property in New Mexico,\nowns any businesses organized in New Mexico or travels regularly to New Mexico. (Ex. A, pghs.\n7-9; Ex. B, pghs. 7-9). The GEO Officers clearly lack โaffiliations with the State [that] are so\nโcontinuous and systematicโ as to render [the defendant] essentially at home in the forum State.โ\nDaimler AG, 571 U.S. at 139. Thus, there is no basis for the exercise of general jurisdiction over\nthem. \nSpecific jurisdiction focuses on โthe relationship among the defendant, the forum, and the\nlitigation โฆ.โ Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 204 (1977). HRDC must demonstrate that the GEO\nOfficers โpurposely established contact with New Mexicoโ and that its โcause of action arose out\nof those contacts with New Mexico.โ Trei, 2014-NMCA-104, ยถ 6, 336 P.3d at 395. It must also be\n7\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 8 of 12\nโdefendantโs activities which must provide the basis for personal jurisdiction, not the acts of other\ndefendants or third parties.โ Visarraga v. Gates Rubber Co., 1986-NMCA-021, ยถ 15, 717 P.2d\n596. \nNeither of the GEO Officers has purposefully established contact with New Mexico. The\nComplaint alleges, in a cursory fashion, that the GEO Officers were โpolicymaker[s] for Defendant\nGEO with respect to the operation of the LCCF, including for policies, practices and customers\ngoverning incoming mail for incarcerated persons.โ (Complaint [doc. 1] at ยถยถ 14, 15). However,\nthe GEO Officers in fact played no role in drafting, creating or implementing the mail and\ncorrespondence policies that form the basis for the Complaint. (Ex. A, pghs. 11-12; Ex. B, pghs.\n11-12). Those policies were drafted by NMCD and implemented by others. The mere fact that the\ncorporation for which the GEO Officers work contracts with a New Mexico county to provide\ncertain services at a correctional facility in New Mexico is insufficient to establish specific\njurisdiction over the GEO Officers.\nThe GEO Officers lack minimum contacts with the State of New Mexico that would\nwarrant the exercise of jurisdiction over them. For this reason alone, the Motion to Dismiss should\nbe granted.\nB. The Exercise of Personal Jurisdiction Over the GEO Officers Offends Traditional\nNotions of Fair Play and Substantial Justice.\nBecause the GEO Officers lack minimum contacts with the State of New Mexico, the Court\nneed not address whether exercising jurisdiction over them offends traditional notions of fair play\nand substantial justice. Eighteen Seventy, LP v. Jayson, 32 F.4th 956, 965 (10th Cir. 2022) (โHere,\nbecause we ultimately conclude that Mr. Jayson does not have the minimum contacts necessary to\nsupport the exercise of specific jurisdiction over him in Wyoming, we need not determine whether\nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction over Mr. Jayson would โoffend traditional notions of fair play\n8\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 9 of 12\nand substantial justiceโโ).  Should the Court elect to proceed, however, it is apparent the GEO\nOfficersโ liberty interests would be infringed if the Court were to exercise personal jurisdiction\nover them in this litigation. \nThe Court must consider (1) the burden on the defendant, (2) the forum stateโs interests in\nresolving the dispute, (3) the plaintiffโs interest in receiving convenient and effectual relief, (4) the\ninterstate judicial systemโs interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and\n(5) the shared interest of the several states in furthering fundamental social policies. Marcus Food\nCo., 671 F.3d at 1167. The burden associated with the GEO Officersโ participation in this litigation\nis significant. The distance between New Mexico and Florida is vast. Certainly, New Mexico has\nan interest in ensuring that inmates housed in its custody are not subjected to unconstitutional\npolicies. However, HRDC cannot obtain effectual or convenient relief from the GEO Officers.\nQuite to the contrary, HRDCโs claims against the GEO Officers, whether in their individual or\nofficial capacities, serve only to impede the litigation of their substantive claim and will require\nunnecessary motions practices as those claims are subject to dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6). \nRegarding the official capacity claims, HRDC has also sued GEO. Suing an individual in\nhis official capacity is merely another way of suing the entity by which the individual is employed.\nKentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165 (1985); Monell v. Depโt of Social Servs. of the City of New\nYork, 436 U.S. 658, 690 n. 55 (1978).  โ[W]here โa plaintiff chooses to sue both the municipality\nand the municipal officials in their official capacities, courts routinely dismiss the official capacity\nclaims as redundant.โโ Doe v. Farmington Mun. Sch., 2022 WL 9956170, at *1 (D.N.M. Oct. 17,\n2022) (quoting Buck v. City of Albuquerque, 2006 WL 8443817, at *2 (D.N.M. Aug. 8, 2006) and\nlisting cases). HRDCโs claims against the GEO Officers in their official capacities are duplicative\n9\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 10 of 12\nof its claims against GEO, are redundant and, ultimately, unnecessary. Vondrak v. City of Las\nCruces, 2009 WL 1300945 at *2, n.1 (D.N.M. Mar. 30, 2009) (stating that a ยง 1983 claim โlies\nagainst either a municipality or the officers in their individual capacity โ not against both the\nmunicipality and the officers in their official capacityโ); Stump v. Gates, 777 F.Supp. 808, 816 n.3\n(D. Colo. 1991) (โNaming either is sufficient. Naming both is redundant.โ). Thus, HRDC can attain\nefficient and effective relief (if it is entitled to it) without requiring the Court to exercise\njurisdiction over the residents of another state.\nRegarding the individual capacity claims against the GEO Officers, the Complaint contains\ninsufficient allegations of personal involvement to state a claim for relief. To survive dismissal\nunder Rule 12(b)(6), a complaint must contain sufficient allegations of fact โto state a claim to\nrelief that is plausible on its face.โ Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). โA claim\nhas facial plausibility when the pleaded factual content allows the court to draw the reasonable\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.โ Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662,\n663 (2009)(citing Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556). \nSection 1983 does not authorize a court to impose liability against any state actor under a\ntheory of respondeat superior.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 676.  โIn a ยง 1983 suit . . . the term โsupervisory\nliabilityโ is a misnomerโ because each official โis only liable for his or her own misconduct.โ  Id.\nat 677.  โBecause vicarious liability is inapplicable to . . . ยง 1983 suits, a plaintiff must plead that\neach Government-official defendant, through the officialโs own individual actions, has violated the\nConstitution.โ  Id. at 676. \nThe Complaint pleads only that the GEO Officers were โpolicymakersโ for GEO with\nrespect to the operation of the LCCF. (Complaint [doc. 1] at ยถยถ 14, 15). This allegation is\nspeculative and conclusory. As established by the attached affidavits and the evidence and\n10\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 11 of 12\nargument and authorities set forth in GEOโs Response in Opposition to Plaintiffโs Motion for\nPreliminary Injunction, the GEO Officers had nothing to do with the challenged policies. Per the\nGEO Officersโ respective affidavits (Ex. A and Ex. B hereto), the GEO Officers are high level\ncorporate executives. They did not draft the policy at issue nor did they have any personal\ninvolvement whatsoever in implementing it or applying it at the facility level. The GEO Officers\ndid not handle any of the thirteen (13) publications identified in HRDCโs Complaint as having\nbeen improperly rejected at LCCF. They did not instruct any employee to reject any of those\npublications.  They  do  not  supervise  the  employees  who  may  have  rejected  any  of  these\npublications. Since GEO did not create and has no responsibility for the creation of the challenged\nNMCD policies, its high-ranking executives certainly had no involvement in these matters. Thus,\nHRDC has not pled, and cannot establish, that the GEO Officers, through their own individual\nactions, violated the Constitution. \nLitigation of HRDCโs claims against the GEO Officers serves to delay the resolution of the\ndispute at the core of their Complaint: whether NMCDโs mail and correspondence policies are\nunconstitutional. That core dispute is more efficiently and effectively resolved without the GEO\nOfficersโ involvement. Here again, HRDC can attain efficient and effective relief (if it is entitled\nto it) without requiring the Court to exercise jurisdiction over the residents of another state. The\nCourt should decline to exercise jurisdiction over the persons of Brian Evans and Wayne Calabrese\nand should dismiss all claims against them.\nWHERFORE Defendants Brian Evans and Wayne Calabrese respectfully request the Court\nenter an Order granting their Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Personal Jurisdiction, dismissing all\nclaims and causes of action asserted against them herein, amending the caption to remove all\n11\n\nCase 1:24-cv-01091-MIS-KRS     Document 30     Filed 01/10/25     Page 12 of 12\nreference to them as parties-Defendants in this action, and awarding any such other and further\nrelief as the Court deems just and proper.\nRespectfully submitted,\nYLAW, P.C.\nMichael S.
