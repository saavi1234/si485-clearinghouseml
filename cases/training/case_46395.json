On April 14, 2025, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Environmental Integrity Project, and California Communities Against Toxics, four environmental and science research nonprofits, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Plaintiffs sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Represented by Public Citizen, plaintiffs claimed that the removal of environmental justice and climate change-related webpages from government websites without notice impeded their ability to understand, explain, and remedy the injustices faced by communities disproportionately affected by climate change, pollution, and other environmental harms. Plaintiffs alleged the webpage removals violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA). They sought a declaration that the webpage removals were illegal and an order to restore the pages that had been removed. The case was assigned to District Judge Rudolph Contreras.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 16, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a preliminary injunction. The injunction sought would order immediate restoration of several databases and their webpages: EJScreen (an interactive mapping tool providing data on local pollution burdens, and demographic and environmental justice indicators), CEQ&rsquo;s Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), DOE&rsquo;s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool and Community Benefits Map, DOT&rsquo;s Equitable Transportation Community (ETC) Explorer, and FEMA&rsquo;s Future Risk Index. The court directed the parties to develop a briefing schedule on the motion for a preliminary injunction, which it entered. On June 10, defendants filed an opposed motion to stay the time to answer until after the preliminary injunction issue was determined.</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2025, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims against DOE. The claims against the other defendants remained unchanged.</p>\r\n<p>On July 9, 2025, the court denied plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, holding that any harms suffered by plaintiffs were not sufficiently irreparable to qualify for preliminary relief. The court found that plaintiffs' harm was primarily economic and that economic harm could not, alone, qualify as irreparable. The court also cited plaintiffs' two month delay in seeking an injunction as weighing against a finding of irreparable harm.</p>\r\n<p>This case remains ongoing.</p>",

Defendants provided no public warning that the webpages would \ndisappear, and they provided no reasoned explanation for halting public access to the information.  \nWhen they developed these tools for public dissemination, Defendants recognized that the \ntools are singularly useful and actively encouraged the public to rely on them. For Plaintiffs, the \nwebpages were essential to their ability to understand environmental harms, climate change, and \nsocioeconomic stressors; to educate communities about the harms they face; and to engage with \ngovernment officials to mitigate those harms. Defendants’ sudden take-down of the webpages has \nhindered—and in some cases halted—Plaintiffs’ work and forced them to expend additional \nresources searching for alternative sources of information that either do not exist at all, do not \nprovide the same quality, or take more time to access. Without the tools that Defendants have \nremoved, Plaintiffs must expend additional time, effort, and resources to carry out their work, and \nthey cannot engage with policymakers as efficiently or effectively.  \nDefendants’ removal of the webpages was arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with \nlaw, including the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA)—a statute enacted to ensure that \nagencies do not abruptly and arbitrarily revoke access to important resources and to ensure that the \npublic has timely and equitable access to reliable, useful information. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \nThe removal was also undertaken without observance of required procedures. See id. § 706(2)(D). \nGiven the harm to Plaintiffs’ ability to engage in ongoing public debates about changes to \n1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 6 of 29\n \ntransportation, energy, health, and environmental policies, and that Defendants would suffer no \ncognizable harm if required to restore the webpages and data, this Court should enter a preliminary \ninjunction requiring Defendants to restore the webpages that they removed. \nBACKGROUND \n \nRemoval of data and webpages \n \n  Until recently, Defendants ensured public access to interactive webpages that provided \ninformation about the environment and public health, including EPA’s EJScreen, CEQ’s Climate \nand Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST), DOE’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data \n(LEAD) Tool and Community Benefits Map, DOT’s Equitable Transportation Community (ETC) \nExplorer, and FEMA’s Future Risk Index. Beginning in January 2025, Defendants removed each \nof these interactive webpages, as well as the behind-the-scenes webpages and datasets necessary \nfor the interactive pages to function.  \nEPA – EJScreen \n \nOn February 5, 2025, EPA removed from its website EJScreen, webpages that supported \nEJScreen’s functionality, and the EJScreen Application Program Interface (API) tool, which \nallowed the public to automatically collect data from EJScreen using computer code. Grenter Decl. \n¶ 7; Duggan Decl. ¶ 10. Developed over the course of several years and first released to the public \nin 2015, EJScreen was an interactive mapping tool that provided critical data on local pollution \nburdens,  demographic indicators,  and  environmental  justice indicators.  See  EPA,  How  was \nEJSCREEN Developed? (Jan. 19, 2021), https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/how-\nwas-ejscreen-developed_.html.1 EJScreen presented over a dozen environmental and demographic \n \n1 The Court may take “judicial notice of information posted on official public websites of \ngovernment agencies.” Pharm.

(Jan.  19,  2021),  https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/what-\nejscreen_.html. It also presented that data in a more useful interactive format and used the \nunderlying data to create environmental justice indicators that identified communities that face \nunique burdens from pollution. Id. \n  By providing all this data in one place, EJScreen enabled users to analyze the demographic \ncharacteristics and environmental burdens of communities at a granular level. As part of that \nanalysis, EJScreen provided users with color-coded mapping, the ability to generate a report for a \nselected area, and comparisons showing differences between a selected area and the surrounding \nstate,  EPA  region,  or  the  nation.  See  EPA,  Learn  to  Use  EJSCREEN  (Jan.  19,  2021), \nhttps://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/learn-use-ejscreen_.html.  \nEPA promoted public use of EJScreen, recognizing that it “may be of interest to community \nresidents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental or demographic information” and \n“can also support a wide range of research and policy goals.” EPA, Purposes and Uses of \nEJSCREEN (Jan. 19, 2021), https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-\nejscreen_.html. EPA also recognized that because EJScreen provided a consistent nationwide \nmethodology for understanding environmental burdens, it “create[d] a common starting point \nbetween the agency and the public when looking at issues related to environmental justice.” Id. \nAfter removing EJScreen, EPA posted at least some of the data from EJScreen to a public \nrepository. See USEPA/EJAMM-open, https://github.com/USEPA/EJAM-open. However, those \ndatasets are not nearly as functional or useful as the EJScreen webpage, and using that data has \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 8 of 29\n \nproved time-intensive and costly because it requires overcoming steep technical challenges the \nagencies had solved when they originally created the interactive tools. See Williams Decl. ¶ 22; \nDuggan Decl. ¶ 31; Grenter Decl. ¶ 37. \nCEQ – CEJST  \n \nOn January 22, 2025, CEQ removed CJEST and its supporting webpages and datasets. \nGrenter Decl. ¶ 7. Like EJScreen, CEJST was an interactive mapping tool that identified and \nhighlighted communities that face disproportionate environmental burdens using a consistent \nnationwide  methodology.  See  CEQ,  Methodology  (Jan.  17,  2025), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250117221651/https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/methodo\nlogy#3/33.47/-97.5.2 The tool included different environmental and demographic indicators than \ndid EJScreen, combining dozens of datasets on climate change, energy, health, housing, pollution, \ntransportation, water and wastewater, and workforce development. Id. Before it removed CEJST, \nCEQ encouraged public use of and feedback on the tool. See CEQ, About (Jan. 17, 2025), \nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20250117222055/https://screeningtool.geoplatform.gov/en/about#3/\n33.47/-97.5. \n \n2 “The Internet Archive Wayback Machine is a service that allows people to visit archived \nversions of Web sites.

Grenter Decl. ¶ 7. The LEAD \nTool was an interactive mapping tool that helped users understand and compare the cost of energy \nrelative to income for various geographic regions, including census tracts, cities, counties, states, \ntribal lands, and the entire United States. See DOE, LEAD Tool Methodology (Dec. 2024), \nhttps://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/lead-methodology_122024.pdf. DOE created \nthe tool specifically to allow users to “make data-driven decisions on energy goal setting and \nprogram  planning  by  providing  them  information  on  low-to-moderate-income  household \npopulations and associated energy use.” Id. (recognizing that the LEAD Tool helps “fill knowledge \ngaps, conduct strategic energy planning, inform the development of low-income energy programs \nand goals, improve energy program targeting, and increase public awareness of low-income \nhousehold issues”). \nDOE – Community Benefits Map \n \nAt some point between January 25, 2025, and January 29, 2025, DOE removed from its \nwebsite the Community Benefits Map and its supporting webpages and datasets. Grenter Decl. ¶ 7. \nThe Community Benefits Map was an interactive mapping tool that provided information about \nthe location of DOE-funded projects and the community benefits expected to derive from those \nprojects. See DOE, Community Benefits Map for Demonstration and Deployment Projects (Nov. \n22, 2024), https://web.archive.org/web/20241122145403/https://www.energy.gov/infrastructure/ \ncommunity-benefits-map-demonstration-and-deployment-projects.

Id. \nDOT – ETC Explorer \n \nAt some point between January 26, 2025, and February 1, 2025, DOT removed from its \nwebsite the ETC Explorer and its supporting webpages and datasets. Grenter Decl. ¶ 7. The ETC \nExplorer was an interactive mapping tool that compiled location data based on transportation \ninsecurity, climate and disaster risk burden, environmental burden, health vulnerability, and social \nvulnerability.  See  DOT,  ETC  Explorer  (Jan.  26,  2025),  https://web.archive.org/web/\n20250126215618/https:/www.transportation.gov/priorities/equity/justice40/etc-explorer.  The \nETC Explorer was “designed to complement [CEJST] by providing users deeper insight into the \nTransportation  disadvantage  component  of  CEJST,  and  the  ETC  Explorer’s  Transportation \nInsecurity component, which will help ensure the benefits of DOT’s investments are addressing \nthe transportation related causes of disadvantage.” Id. DOT encouraged the public’s use of the \nETC Explorer, explaining that the tool would allow “every community in the country to understand \nhow it is experiencing burden that transportation investments can mitigate or reverse.” Id. \nFEMA – Future Risk Index \n \nIn  February  2025,  FEMA  removed  from  its  website  the  Future  Risk  Index  and  its \nsupporting webpages and datasets. Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 5. The Future Risk Index was an interactive \nmapping tool that provided projected economic losses due to climate change at the county level, \nbased on different climate scenarios and environmental hazards, including coastal flooding, \nextreme heat, wildfire, hurricanes, and drought. See FEMA, Frequently Asked Questions (Jan. 19, \n2025),  https://web.archive.org/web/20250119104326/https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/frequently-\nasked-questions#is-future-risk-incorporated-into-the-national-risk-index.

See id.; Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 12. \nThis lawsuit  \n \n  Plaintiffs Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), Environmental Integrity \nProject (EIP), and California Communities Against Toxics (CCAT) are nonprofit organizations \nthat regularly relied on the removed webpages. See Grenter Decl. ¶ 3; Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 2; Duggan \nDecl. ¶ 2; Williams Decl. ¶ 2. Plaintiffs used the webpages to investigate environmental harms and \neducate the public, to guide where they directed their technical expertise and funding, and to \nengage with public officials. See, e.g., Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 9–33; Phartiyal Decl. ¶¶ 7–12; Duggan \nDecl. ¶¶ 7–27; Williams Decl. ¶¶ 5–16. For example, the webpages allowed EIP to draft a report \nexposing that petroleum refineries that release pollution in waterways are disproportionately \nlocated in communities where the majority of residents are people of color or are considered low-\nincome. Duggan Decl. ¶ 13. And the webpages formed the basis for comments that prompted the \nEPA to strengthen its Major-Minor Source Reclassification Rule, and reduce toxic air pollution in \ncommunities that CCAT works to protect. See Williams Decl. ¶¶ 6–9. Defendants’ removal of \nthese tools has disrupted Plaintiffs’ work and forced them to expend additional resources in search \nof replacement data. See Grenter Decl. ¶ 13; Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 14; Duggan Decl. ¶ 36; Williams \nDecl. ¶ 14; see also infra II. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n \n“To warrant preliminary injunctive relief, the moving party must show (1) a substantial \nlikelihood of success on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were \nnot granted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) \nthat the public interest would be furthered by the injunction.” Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 12 of 29\n \nv. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citations omitted). “When the movant seeks to \nenjoin the government, the final two … factors—balancing the equities and the public interest—\nmerge.” D.A.M. v. Barr, 474 F. Supp. 3d 45, 67 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing Pursuing Am.’s Greatness \nv. FEC, 831 F.3d 500, 511 (D.C. Cir. 2016)). \nARGUMENT \n \n  Each  factor  favors  granting  Plaintiffs’  motion for  a preliminary  injunction.  Because \nDefendants  have  violated  the  requirements  of  the  PRA  and  failed  to  engage  in  reasoned \ndecisionmaking, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. They are currently suffering \nirreparable harm from the substantial disruptions Defendants’ actions have caused to their work \nexplaining environmental harms, advocating for policies that will protect public health and the \nenvironment, and engaging with policymakers. And the balance of the equities and public interest \nweigh decidedly in Plaintiffs’ favor because there is no public interest in the perpetuation of \nDefendants’ unlawful actions and the interest in promoting public understanding and engagement \nwith policies that impact the environment and public health is served by public access to the \nremoved webpages. \nI.  Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits. \n \nA.  Removal of the webpages and datasets violated the Paperwork Reduction Act. \n \n  The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provides that a reviewing court “shall” hold \nunlawful and set aside agency actions “not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); see \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 220 (2012) \n(referring to a claim that an agency has “violate[d] a federal statute” as “a garden-variety APA \nclaim”). Here, Defendants’ removal of the webpages at issue failed to comply with two distinct \nrequirements of the PRA. \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 13 of 29\n \n1.  Defendants violated the Paperwork Reduction Act’s requirement to provide \ntimely and equitable access to public information. \n \nCongress enacted the PRA to “ensure the greatest  possible public benefit from and \nmaximize the utility of information created, collected, maintained, used, shared and disseminated \nby or for the Federal Government” and to “provide for the dissemination of public information on \na timely basis, on equitable terms, and in a manner that promotes the utility of the information to \nthe public and makes effective use of information technology.” 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501(2), (7). To \naccomplish these goals, Congress mandated that every agency “ensure that the public has timely \nand equitable access to the agency’s public information.” Id. § 3506(d)(1).  \nThe PRA defines “public information” as “any information, regardless of form or format, \nthat an agency discloses, disseminates, or makes available to the public.” Id. § 3502(12). When an \nagency  first  “discloses,  disseminates,  or  makes  [information]  available  to  the  public,”  that \ninformation becomes “public information.” Id. § 3502(12); see H.R. Rep. No. 104-37, at 109 \n(contrasting  the  PRA  with  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  and  explaining  that  “‘[p]ublic \ninformation’ is  information  that  an  agency  has  in  fact  made  public”).  Because  Defendants \nmaintained the removed webpages on their publicly accessible websites, the contents of those \nwebpages are public information, and the requirement to provide timely and equitable access \nattaches to them.  \nHere, Defendants’ removal of the interactive webpages denies “timely” access to “public \ninformation” for two reasons. First, some of the information on the pages was available only \nthrough those webpages. For example, the Future Risk Index provided a novel assessment of the \ncosts of climate change that is not available elsewhere, Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 12, and EJScreen included \nunique environmental burden indices and percentiles. See EPA, Environmental Justice Indexes in \nEJSCREEN,  (Jan.  19,  2021),  https://19january2021snapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/environmental-\n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 14 of 29\n \njustice-indexes-ejscreen_.html. By removing access to the webpages, Defendants effectively \nrevoked access to that information. And, to state the obvious, access to information cannot be \ntimely if there is no access at all. \nSecond, the agencies have recognized that the interactive webpages enabled the public to \nunderstand the environmental burdens they face and how government policies impact those \nburdens.  See  supra  pp.  3–6.  When  Defendants  created  the  webpages,  they  consolidated \ninformation from numerous other data sources and solved the difficult technical problems inherent \nin creating a consistent and user-friendly nationwide approach for combining that data. Id. By \npresenting that information in an interactive format and, in the case of EJScreen, with the ability \nto instantly generate PDF summary reports, Defendants ensured that the public had easy access to \nthe information whenever they needed it. See Williams Decl. ¶ 26; Grenter Decl. ¶ 38; Duggan \nDecl. ¶ 24. Attempting to collect the information from the disparate sources that Defendants \nconsolidated with their interactive tools and to display it in a comprehensible format would require \n“[a]  significant  investment  of  time  and  resources”  and  “would  present  technical  and  data \nmanagement challenges.” Duggan Decl. ¶ 31; see Grenter Decl. ¶ 37. By denying access to the \ninteractive webpages, Defendants have therefore effectively denied access to all the information \nfor a substantial portion of the public. See Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 15; Grenter Decl. ¶ 37; Duggan Decl. \n¶¶ 29, 31, 35; Williams Decl. ¶¶ 25–27.  \nMoreover, even well-resourced and technically-savvy members of the public are now \ndenied timely access to the information because, in situations with limited timeframes, they are \nrequired to engage in a time- and labor-intensive process to retrieve the data that was previously \naccessible through the interactive webpages. The removed webpages are particularly important \nbecause they allow members of the public to quickly conduct analyses that can be submitted in \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 15 of 29\n \nsupport of comments in administrative proceedings. See Williams Decl. ¶¶ 5–13; Grenter Decl. \n¶¶ 32–33; Duggan Decl. ¶ 27. Many public comment periods “are a maximum of 30 days,” so the \ndelays in accessing public information that Defendants have imposed by removing the interactive \nwebpages  will  frequently  prevent  Plaintiffs  “from  meaningfully  participating  under  these \nconstrained timelines.” Williams Decl. ¶ 26; see, e.g., U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, Public Notice \nof Application for Permit (Apr. 28, 2025) (seven-day comment period);3 U.S. Army Corp of \nEngineers, Public Notice (Apr. 21, 2025) (thirteen-day comment period).4 Defendants’ action has \nthus undermined a key use of the data and denied timely access to Plaintiffs. \n  Defendants’  removal  of  webpages  is  also  not  “equitable.”  In  enacting  the  PRA’s \ninformation dissemination requirements, Congress “require[d] agencies not only to refrain from \nenhancing the position of some members of the public over that of others, but to refrain from \nenhancing the Federal Government’s position over that of others as well.” H.R. Rep. No. 104-37, \nat 45. Removing access to the interactive tools, however, disadvantages the public, which now \nmust spend substantial resources to attempt to access other, insufficient sources of information that \nthe government possesses and previously made readily available. And again, only well-resourced \nmembers of the public with technical expertise can even attempt to do so. See Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 15; \nDuggan Decl. ¶ 35; Grenter Decl. ¶ 37; Williams Decl. ¶ 25. Those barriers violate the duty to \nprovide equitable access to public information. \n \n3  https://www.nws.usace.army.mil/Portals/27/docs/regulatory2/Public%20Notices/2025/ \nNWS-2024-23-PN.pdf?ver=WLa0grFTKFw6z-ltO_jT8g%3d%3d. \n4 https://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Portals/26/docs/regulatory/PN%20APRIL/SWG-2025-\n00115%20TXCPL%20PN%20(Energy%20EO).pdf?ver=x-583fPypUiD0pJ6EvCq3g%3d%3d. \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 16 of 29\n \n2.  Defendants failed to observe procedures required by the PRA. \n \nThrough the PRA, Congress required agencies to “provide adequate notice when initiating, \nsubstantially modifying, or terminating significant information dissemination products.” 44 U.S.C. \n§ 3506(d)(3). When Congress has set out a procedural requirement, such as a requirement to \nprovide notice or an opportunity to comment prior to agency action, and the agency fails to satisfy \nthat requirement, this Court has found the action to be both “not in accordance with law and \nwithout observance of procedure required by law, in violation of Section 706 of the APA.”5 United \nSteel, Paper & Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., Energy, Allied Indus. & Serv. Workers Int’l Union v. Fed. \nHighway Admin., 151 F. Supp. 3d 76, 93–94 (D.D.C. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, before removing the webpages, Defendants failed to observe the PRA’s notice requirement. \nGovernment-wide guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget explains that \nthe term “information dissemination product” includes “any electronic document … or web page” \nthat an agency disseminates to the public. 67 Fed. Reg. 8452, 8460 (Feb. 22, 2002). Here, the \nwebpages that Defendants removed are all “electronic document[s]” or “web page[s]” that the \nagencies had disseminated to the public, id., and, therefore, are all information dissemination \nproducts.  \nEach  of  the  datasets  and  webpages  is  also  a  “significant  information  dissemination \nproduct.” The information they provided was key to the public’s understanding of how pollution, \nclimate change, and policy choices about energy and transportation impact public health and the \nenvironment. See, e.g., Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 6, 8–33; Phartiyal Decl. ¶¶ 4, 7–13; Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 5, \n \n5 The D.C. Circuit has occasionally permitted agency action to stand while an agency \ncorrects procedural flaws if “equity demands.” Fertilizer Inst. v. EPA, 935 F.2d 1303, 1312 (D.C. \nCir. 1991). As discussed below, the equities here do not weigh in favor of allowing Defendants’ \nunlawful actions to stand while they undertake required procedures. \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 17 of 29\n \n7–30; Williams Decl. ¶¶ 5–19. Government agencies have frequently relied on the information \nwhen making decisions. See, e.g., Williams Decl. ¶¶ 6–9 (explaining that comments supported by \nEJScreen data led EPA to strengthen its Major-Minor Source Reclassification Rule); 40 C.F.R. \n§ 1508.1(f) (directing agencies to use CEJST, EJScreen, and similar tools “[t]o assist in identifying \ncommunities with environmental justice concerns”).6 Defendants themselves have recognized the \nsingular usefulness of the information that the removed webpages provided, and they invested \nsubstantial resources and years of time to develop the tools. See supra pp. 3–6; cf. OMB Circular \nA-130,  1993  WL  357572,  at  *40  (June  28,  1993)  (including  as  examples  of  “significant” \ninformation dissemination products those that “by reason of the nature of the information, are \nmatters of continuing public interest,” “by reason of the time value of the information, command \npublic interest,” or “involve expenditure of substantial funds”).  \nBecause the removed pages have a substantial impact on the public’s understanding of \nenvironmental harms, affect how the public engages with policymakers, and involved substantial \nexpenditure of funds, they qualify as significant information dissemination products. Accordingly, \nDefendants  were  required  to  provide  “adequate  notice”  before  removing  them.  44  U.S.C. \n§ 3506(d)(3). Defendants, however, failed to provide any notice at all. Without notice, Plaintiffs’ \nwork was thrown into disarray. See Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 14 (discussing disruptions caused by the \nremovals); Williams Decl. ¶¶ 22, 26 (same); Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 33–34, 36 (same); Grenter Decl. \n¶ 30 (same). Further, Defendants’ failure to provide notice undermined “[t]he purpose of the \nnotice,” which “is to maximize the ability of the public to influence agency information plans at \n \n6 CEQ recently issued an interim final rule rescinding this regulation. 90 Fed. Reg. 10610 \n(Feb. 25, 2025). The recently rescinded regulation nonetheless shows the importance of the \nremoved webpages. \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 18 of 29\n \nan early stage.” H.R. Rep. No. 104-37, at 46; c.f. 44 U.S.C. § 3506(d)(2) (requiring agencies to \n“solicit and consider public input on the agency’s information dissemination activities”).  \nDefendants thus acted in violation of the PRA.  \nB.  Removal of the interactive tools and datasets was arbitrary and capricious. \nAgency  action  is  arbitrary  and  capricious  when  it  is  not  the  product  of  “reasoned \ndecisionmaking.” DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 16 (2020) (quoting Michigan \nv. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015)). “[T]he agency must examine the relevant data and articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its action including a ‘rational connection between the facts found and \nthe choice made.’” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 \nU.S. 29, 43 (1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \nAnd it must consider each “important aspect of the problem.” Id. \nHere, Defendants failed to offer a reasoned explanation for their actions. Indeed, with one \nexception, Defendants failed to offer any contemporaneous public justification for removing the \ninteractive tools. See SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947) (holding that a “reviewing \ncourt … must judge the propriety of [agency] action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency” \nat the time of the action).  \nThe one exception was DOE’s explanation regarding the Community Benefits Map, but its \nexplanation was patently deficient. On January 23, 2025, DOE issued a memorandum “directing \na suspension of … diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, procedures, programs, activities, \nand reviews involving or relating to DEI objectives and principles … [and of actions] requiring, \nusing, or enforcing Community Benefits Plans.”7 However, that memorandum neither explained \n \n7 Ingrid C. Kolb, Acting Secretary, Memorandum re: Executive Order on Ending Radical \nand Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, and Agency-Wide Policy to Promote \n \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 19 of 29\n \nhow the removals complied with DOE’s information dissemination duties nor accounted for \nreliance interests upset by the removal. DOE developed the Community Benefits Map to improve \npublic knowledge and to encourage members of the public, like Plaintiffs, to engage with DOE \nprojects. See supra p. 5. Plaintiffs and other members of the public regularly relied on the removed \nwebpages to analyze environmental burdens, to educate their communities, and to engage with \ngovernment officials whose decisions would impact their communities. See infra II. Where an \nagency’s actions have “engendered serious reliance interests,” the agency must provide a “more \nsubstantial justification” than usual. Perez v. Mortg. Bankers Ass’n, 575 U.S. 92, 106 (2015) \n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. at \n33 (holding that where an agency is “not writing on a blank slate, it [is] required to assess whether \nthere [are] reliance interests, determine whether they [are] significant, and weigh any such interests \nagainst competing policy concerns” (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). DOE’s lack \nof consideration of the public’s reliance on the webpages further demonstrates that its action—like \nthat of the other Defendants—was arbitrary and capricious. \nIn two instances, well after removing the webpages, agency leadership issued memoranda \nreferring to the removals. First, in a memorandum five weeks after EPA took down EJScreen, \nJeffrey Hall, Acting Assistant Administrator at EPA, issued a memorandum “to provide initial \nguidance on implementing” EPA’s enforcement and compliance initiatives consistently with three \nexecutive  orders  and  an  initiative set  out  by  EPA’s  Administrator.  Hall,  Memorandum  re: \nImplementing National Enforcement and Compliance Initiatives Consistently with Executive \n \nEqual  Opportunity  (Jan.  23,  2025),  https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-\n02/Memorandum%20signed%20by%20Acting%20Secretary%20of%20Energy%20Ingrid%20C.\n%20Kolb%20dated%20January%2023%202025%20%28002%29.pdf. \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 20 of 29\n \nOrders and Agency Priorities, at 1 (Mar. 12, 2025) (Hall Memo).8 The memorandum stated that \n“environmental justice considerations shall no longer inform EPA’s enforcement and compliance \nassurance work,” and, accordingly, that “EJScreen … has been disabled and may not be used for \nany enforcement or compliance activity.” Hall Memo, at 1. And in a memorandum issued a week \nafter CEQ removed CEJST, CEQ Chief of Staff Katherine Scarlett stated that, because the \nPresident rescinded two executive orders that addressed environmental justice, agencies “should \nnot include an environmental justice analysis” when undertaking environmental impact reviews. \nScarlett, Memorandum re: Implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act, at 5 (Feb. \n19, 2025) (Scarlett Memo).9 Neither memorandum provides a reasoned explanation for the \nwebpage removals. The Hall memo does not identify which executive order supposedly required \nEPA to remove EJScreen, much less what language in the executive order required the removal. \nThe Scarlett memo, for its part, does not explain why the revocation of executive orders that \nmandated consideration of environmental justice barred their consideration. More importantly, \nwhile the memoranda state that the agencies are not going to rely on the removed tools, their \nstatements do not illuminate why the agencies denied the public access to the webpages. \nII.  Plaintiffs  are  suffering  and  will  suffer  irreparable  injury  absent  a  preliminary \ninjunction. \n \n  The loss of access to webpages that provided uniquely useful information about the \nenvironment  and  public  health  imposes  irreparable  harm  on  Plaintiffs.  Defendants  have \n \n8  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/implementingnecisconsistently\nwitheosandagencypriorities.pdf. \n9 https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-guidance/CEQ-Memo-Implementation-of-\nNEPA-02.19.2025.pdf. \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 21 of 29\n \nhindered—and, in some instances, completely halted—the ability of Plaintiffs to carry out key \nportions of their work and to participate in public decisionmaking processes.  \nPlaintiffs frequently used the removed webpages to understand environmental harms, \neducate the public about those harms, and engage with government officials whose actions would \nmitigate or exacerbate those harms. To start, Plaintiffs relied on the removed webpages to assess \nwhere to allocate their limited resources to alleviate the greatest environmental burdens. EIP, for \ninstance, provides funding to “ensure that local communities and environmental advocates have \naccess  to  high-quality  science  and  engineering  expertise.”  Duggan  Decl.  ¶ 22.  EIP  took \ninformation from EJScreen and CEJST into account as a factor in making its funding decisions, \nsince a goal of the funding is to “support[] communities most affected by pollution and historically \nleft out of environmental decision-making.” Id. ¶ 23; see id. 24–25 (describing additional ways in \nwhich EIP uses EJScreen and CEJST to evaluate candidate communities for technical assistance). \nSierra Club similarly used the Community Benefits Map to “identify the communities impacted \nby  decarbonization  demonstration  projects”  so  it  could  “provide  those  communities  with \ninformation on the projects and other nearby DOE funded projects … and address other needs of \n[those] communities.” Grenter Decl. ¶ 29. Sierra Club also used the LEAD Tool to make decisions \nabout the communities to which it offered assistance in seeking relief from high energy burdens, \nid. ¶ 27, and used the ETC explorer “to identify existing community needs and calculate the \nbenefits of developing particular transit routes,” id. ¶ 20; see id. ¶¶ 21–22. \nOnce Plaintiffs had decided where to focus their limited resources, they relied on the \nremoved  webpages  to  educate  the  public,  provide  technical  assistance  to  communities \nexperiencing environmental burdens, and engage with government officials. Sierra Club, UCS, \nand  EIP  each  expend  substantial  resources  developing  reports  to  understand  and  explain \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 22 of 29\n \nenvironmental harms and had relied on EJScreen as a key part of those reports. See Grenter Decl. \n¶¶ 11, 13, 32; Phartiyal Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9; Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 11–14. For example, UCS’s report \n“Invisible Threat, Inequitable Impact” relied on EJScreen to explain how ethylene oxide emissions \ndisproportionately burden disadvantaged communities across the country. Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 7. \nUCS, EIP, and Sierra Club also frequently relied on CEJST, the LEAD tool, and the Future Risk \nIndex to produce novel reports that provided them and the public with a better understanding of \nhow environmental harms impact issues ranging from public health to affordable housing to energy \ncosts. See Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 7 (UCS reports using CEJST); id. ¶ 11 (UCS reports using the LEAD \ntool); id. ¶ 12 (UCS reports using the Future Risk Index); Grenter Decl. ¶ 32 (Sierra Club reports \nusing CEJST); id. ¶¶ 23–26 (Sierra Club reports using the LEAD tool); Duggan Decl. ¶ 17 (EIP \nreports using CEJST). \nPlaintiffs also relied on EJScreen and CEJST to develop interactive webpages of their own. \nFor example, EIP relied on EJScreen’s Application Program Interface (API) tool to automatically \ncollect information for routine updates to its Oil & Gas Watch website, which monitors the \nexpansion of petrochemical facilities and informs the public about opportunities to submit public \ncomments on federal and state permits issued to those facilities. See Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 17–20; see \nalso Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 12, 16 (discussing Sierra Club’s use of EJScreen for its interactive Liquefied \nNatural Gas Export Tracker and interactive maps of large warehouses). EIP likewise incorporated \ninformation from CEJST into its interactive maps, including its interactive map of existing and \nproposed CO2 pipelines. See Duggan Decl. ¶ 17. And Sierra Club used the LEAD tool “to create \nthe Missouri Energy Burden Explorer, an interactive map that presents energy burden data by \ncensus tract, as well as data on income, race, and respiratory illness rates.” Grenter Decl. ¶ 25.  \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 23 of 29\n \nThe reports and interactive webpages that Plaintiffs created using the removed pages were \nessential to their work educating the public about environmental harms. See, e.g., Grenter Decl. \n¶¶ 14–15, 25; Duggan Decl. ¶ 8. Plaintiffs also relied on the removed webpages to conduct public \neducation without formal reports, and to provide training services to community partners that were \nseeking to understand and address environmental burdens where they live. For example, Sierra \nClub used “DOE’s Community Benefits Map to help educate and organize communities about \nindustrial decarbonization demonstration projects.” Grenter Decl. ¶ 29; see id. ¶ 32; Phartiyal \nDecl. ¶ 10 (describing how UCS used EJScreen and CEJST as training tools so its local partners \ncould “understand environmental and health stressors in their communities”); id. ¶ 13 (explaining \nthat UCS used the removed webpages “to provide technical assistance to communities that seek to \nunderstand and advocate about the environmental burdens they face”; Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 24–25 \n(describing how EIP “relies on EJScreen and CEJST for quick, reliable identification of certain \nrisk levels” when providing technical assistance to communities); Williams Decl. ¶ 5 (explaining \nthat CCAT relied on EJScreen and CEJST “to create maps and analyses for education … to protect \npublic health and communities”).  \nFinally, Plaintiffs relied on the removed webpages when engaging with public officials. \nPlaintiffs used the removed webpages to educate public officials just as they used the webpages to \neducate other members of the public. E.g., Grenter Decl. ¶ 11. And Plaintiffs relied on the removed \nwebpages particularly heavily when submitting comments on proposed rulemakings or permits. \nSee, e.g., Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 32–33; Duggan Decl. ¶ 27; Williams Decl. ¶¶ 5–13. For example, \n“CCAT, in cooperation with other organizations, used EJScreen and CEJST data to support \ncomments on the EPA’s Major-Minor Source Reclassification Rule.” Williams Decl. ¶ 6. “As a \nresult of CCAT’s efforts, the EPA strengthened the proposed rule,” ensuring that “large polluters \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 24 of 29\n \nmaintain the pollution controls that limit emissions of toxic air pollution.” Id. ¶ 9. The removed \nwebpages were particularly valuable in that setting because they provided a “common starting \npoint between the agency and the public,” EPA, Purposes and Uses of EJSCREEN, supra, which \neliminated the need to spend time disputing the reliability of data sources,  see id. ¶ 21, 24 \n(explaining that EJScreen and CEJST are uniquely “recognized and accepted by … federal \nagencies” and “eliminated the need for expert testimony in litigation and regulatory proceedings \nto validate … data collection”); Duggan Decl. ¶ 29 (recognizing that EJScreen and CEJST are \n“authoritative”). The interactive webpages were also particularly valuable because they decreased \nthe time needed to put together comments on permitting and regulatory processes. See Williams \nDecl. ¶¶ 21, 26; Grenter Decl. ¶ 38; Duggan Decl. ¶ 27. Because most regulatory processes provide \nonly a short window in which the public may make their voices heard, the time-savings the \nremoved webpages provided compared to other sources of information were essential for ensuring \nthe public could “meaningfully participat[e]” in the regulatory process. Williams Decl. ¶ 26. \nIndeed, the removed webpages allowed the public to undertake analysis quickly enough that they \ncould engage with public officials to improve responses to ongoing emergencies: after the Maui \nwildfires in 2023, Sierra Club successfully used EJScreen and CEJST in conjunction with other \nresearch to advocate to local health officials to prioritize the evacuation of vulnerable populations. \nGrenter Decl. ¶ 33.  \n  Without the interactive webpages, all the work described above will either be halted or will \nrequire additional time and resources. Simply put, “[t]here are no adequate substitutes available \nfor the eliminated federal tools.” Grenter Decl. ¶ 36. Plaintiffs relied on the removed webpages \nbecause of their unique combination of “standardization, reliability, precision, and functionality,” \nDuggan Decl. ¶ 30, and because they provided “one-of-a-kind information,” Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 12. \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 25 of 29\n \nNo other data sources offer the same characteristics that made the removed webpages useful, and \nattempting to create a replacement from existing data source would require “[a] significant \ninvestment of time and resources” and “would present technical and data management challenges.” \nDuggan Decl. ¶ 31; see Grenter Decl. ¶ 37 (“It is extremely time-consuming to try to recreate the \nsame analyses and reports that are available by using the federal tools.”). \nPlaintiffs have already experienced disruptions due to the removals. Plaintiffs have halted \nor delayed work on their analysis of environmental burdens. Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 14 (observing that \n“UCS  has  already  had  to  halt  work  on  some  of  its  projects,”  including  those  on  housing \naffordability, the health impacts of nuclear materials exposure, and energy affordability); Williams \nDecl. ¶ 22 (“CCAT has already felt these impacts, including when it had to stop work on its project \nto inventory landfill pollution impacts across several states[.]”); Duggan Decl. ¶ 36 (stating that \n“EIP has already had to invest additional resources to gather and analyze data without access to \nEJScreen,”  including  “develop[ing]  and  run[ning]  a  new  computer  code”  and  “spend[ing] \nadditional time reconciling inconsistencies in [the replacement data]”). They have lost some of the \nfunctionality of their own interactive webpages. See Duggan Decl. ¶ 33 (“Without access to EPA’s \nEJScreen and the API tool, EIP is not capable of manually collecting, disseminating and evaluating \nthe information [required by its Oil & Gas Watch] at the same pace and scale.”). They have had to \nstop education and organizing efforts with their community partners. See Grenter Decl. ¶ 30 (“The \nremoval of the Community Benefits Map has prevented the Sierra Club from continuing its work \nto educate, organize, and mobilize communities around … opportunities to secure additional \ncommunity benefits as part of clean manufacturing projects.”). They have been unable to consider \ninformation from the removed websites when deciding where to allocate their scarce resources. \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 26 of 29\n \nSee Duggan Decl. ¶ 34. And they have been hindered in their ability to engage with public officials. \nWilliams Decl. ¶ 26. \nBecause “[t]here are no adequate substitutes available for the eliminated federal tools,” \nGrenter Decl. ¶ 36, these harms will persist going forward. Without access to the removed \nwebpages, where they can, Plaintiffs will need to “[p]ursue other means to individually gather \ndemographic and environmental burden information and establish a standardized and authoritative \nmethod to analyze, calculate, and evaluate demographic data at scale.” Duggan Decl. ¶ 35. But \nthat will require them to “invest considerably more of [their] limited time, money, and effort” to \nobtain the same information. Id.; see Phartiyal Decl. ¶ 15; Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 35, 37; Williams Decl. \n¶ 25. Even when Plaintiffs have the time and resources necessary to obtain the same information \nthat they readily could have obtained from the removed webpages, that added expense means they \nwill “be forced to abandon some of [their] other work.” Grenter Decl. ¶ 37; see Phartiyal Decl. \n¶ 15 (“UCS will be forced to abandon some projects due to resource limitations.”). Further, \nbecause finding alternative sources of information is time-intensive, “the removals may deny \n[them] the ability to timely participate in the rulemaking process” even when they would otherwise \ninvest the time and resources to seek out alternative data sources. Williams Decl. ¶ 26.  \nThese harms undermine Plaintiffs’ core organizational functions in ways that cannot be \nfully remedied at the end of the case. See League of Women Voters of the United States v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 8 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (observing that an organization suffers irreparable harm “if the \nactions  taken  by  [the  defendant]  have  perceptibly  impaired  the  [organization’s]  programs” \n(internal quotation marks omitted; alterations in original)). Plaintiffs’ work is time-sensitive, and \nevery day the webpages are down they lose out on the opportunity to engage in ongoing public \ndebate about transportation, energy, public health, and environmental policies. See Am. Immigr. \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 27 of 29\n \nCouncil v. DHS, 470 F. Supp. 3d 32, 38 (D.D.C. 2020) (recognizing that agencies inflict irreparable \nharm by “den[ying] access to information that is highly relevant to an ongoing public debate”). \nAbsent an injunction from this Court, Plaintiffs will continue to lose out on opportunities to \nparticipate in the marketplace of ideas and to engage directly with public officials.  \nIII.  The balance of the equities and the public interest favor Plaintiffs.  \n \n  As against the certain and irreparable injury that Plaintiffs are presently experiencing due \nto Defendants’ unlawful actions, Defendants would suffer no cognizable harm if required to restore \nthe webpages and datasets. To begin with, “[i]t is well established that the Government ‘cannot \nsuffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.’” C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. \nSupp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Open Communities Alliance v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. \n3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017)). Likewise, “[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation \nof unlawful agency action.” Open Communities Alliance, 286 F. Supp. 3d at 179 (citation omitted). \n“To the contrary, there is a substantial public interest in having governmental agencies abide by \nthe federal laws.” Id. (citation omitted). \nMoreover, communities around the country are harmed by Defendants’ actions, and both \nthe health of the country and principles of public participation in government are put at risk. By \nremoving resources from their websites, Defendants have made it harder for communities to \nunderstand the environmental burdens they face and to advocate for policies that will improve their \nhealth and well-being. See Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 38–39 (discussing harms to communities); Duggan \nDecl. ¶¶ 23, 32 (discussing harms to EIP’s ability to “support[] communities most affected by \npollution and historically left out of environmental decision-making”). The removals impose \nsubstantial costs on Plaintiffs’ access to information and participation in public decisionmaking \nprocesses, but “they are even more harmful to other organizations and members of the public who \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 20-1     Filed 05/16/25     Page 28 of 29\n \nrely on the user-friendly interface [the removed webpages] provide and who wholly lack time, \nresources, and expertise to seek out or make use of (still-insufficient) alternative data sources.” \nWilliams Decl. ¶ 27. Without ready access to user-friendly tools for understanding environmental \nharms and how changes in policy may impact their lives, people around the country will be left in \nthe dark about decisions that impact their lives and will be unable to ensure their voices are heard \nwhen the government implements new transportation, energy, health, and environmental policies.  \nOn the other side of the ledger, Defendants would suffer no injury from being required to \nhost on their websites the same information that they hosted until recently. The balance of equities \nthus weighs decisively in favor of granting a preliminary injunction.  \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion and enter a preliminary \ninjunction ordering restoration of EJScreen, CEJST, the LEAD tool, the Community Benefits Map, \nthe ETC Explorer, and the Future Risk Index and the webpages necessary for those pages to \noperate.  \nDated: May 16, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n/s/ Zachary R.

Over the last three months, Defendants the Environmental Protection Agency \n(EPA), Center for Environmental Quality (CEQ), Department of Energy (DOE), Department of \nTransportation (DOT), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), have removed \npublicly accessible webpages that served as key sources for information about environmental \njustice and climate change. \n2.  The webpages are essential tools for explaining how communities around the \ncountry are harmed or benefited by policy choices regarding the environment, transportation, and \nenergy. The webpages support work examining how the costs of pollution affect disadvantaged \ncommunities, provide the means by which community advocates can explain environmental \nharms, and provide the foundation for public participation in regulatory and legislative processes. \n3.  Without these webpages, Plaintiffs are impeded in their ability to understand, \nexplain, or seek to remedy the injustices faced by communities disproportionately affected by \nclimate change, pollution, and other environmental harms, and they must expend additional time, \neffort, and resources to carry out their work.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 3 of 23\n4.  Defendants  took  down  the  vitally  important  webpages  at  issue  here  without \nproviding required notice of their action, and the removals are arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of \ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with the law.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331, because \nthis action arises under the laws of the United States, namely, the Paperwork Reduction Act of \n1995 (PRA), 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 706. \n6.  Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because \nDefendants are agencies of the United States. \nPARTIES \n \n7.  Plaintiff Sierra Club is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated under the \nlaws of the State of California. Sierra Club has more than 620,000 members nationwide dedicated \nto exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth. Among other things, Sierra Club \ninforms and educates the public about the activities of the EPA and other federal agencies entrusted \nwith the administration of public-health and environmental laws, with the aim of improving public \nunderstanding of, and support for, public health and environmental protection. The Sierra Club has \na long history of advocacy and public education about the dangers of climate change-causing and \nother pollution, as well as the importance of federal enforcement of the Clean Air Act, Clean Water \nAct, and other bedrock environmental statutes. \n8.  Plaintiff Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) is a nonprofit organization with the \nmission of conducting scientific analysis and research in the public interest. UCS combines \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 4 of 23\ntechnical analysis and effective advocacy to create innovative, practical solutions for a healthy, \nsafe, and sustainable future.  \n9.  Plaintiff Environmental Integrity Project (EIP) is a national nonprofit organization \ndedicated to advocating for more effective enforcement of environmental laws. EIP (1) conducts \nresearch and data analysis that is shared with the public, illustrating how the failure to enforce or \nimplement environmental laws increases pollution and harms public health; (2) engages in legal \nadvocacy to hold federal and state agencies, as well as individual corporations, accountable for \nfailing to enforce or comply with environmental laws; and (3) provides legal and technical \nresources to organizations and communities that help them obtain the protection of environmental \nlaws. EIP invests substantial time and effort documenting how air and water pollution from \nindustrial operations threatens human health and the environment, particularly in areas that may \nhave higher environmental burdens and vulnerable populations. \n10.  Plaintiff  California  Communities  Against  Toxics  (CCAT)  is  a  nonprofit \norganization of over 25 organizational members and thousands of individuals across California \ndedicated to advancing environmental justice and public health.  For the past three decades, CCAT \nhas  sought  to  reduce  pollution  from  industrial  sources  and  to  protect  members’  and  local \ncommunities’ rights to a safe environment. CCAT educates communities, policymakers, and \nelected officials about the adverse health and environmental impacts of air, water, and soil \npollution. Through its work, CCAT has formed strategic partnerships with other environmental \njustice groups across the country, providing them technical support and working with them to \nengage  in  public  comment  periods  on  relevant  federal  and  state  proceedings  and  permit \napplications. CCAT also advances environmental justice and pollution prevention efforts by \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 5 of 23\nadvocating in legislative, administrative, educational, and legal arenas on behalf of itself and its \nmembership.  \n11.

Congress enacted the PRA to “ensure the greatest possible public benefit from and \nmaximize the utility of information created, collected, maintained, used, shared and disseminated \nby or for the Federal Government” and “provide for the dissemination of public information on a \ntimely basis, on equitable terms, and in a manner that promotes the utility of the information to the \npublic and makes effective use of information technology.” 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501(2), (7).  \n17.  To accomplish those goals, the PRA mandates that every agency must “ensure that \nthe public has timely and equitable access to the agency’s public information” and must “provide \nadequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information \ndissemination products.” 44 U.S.C. §§ 3506(d)(1), (3). \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 6 of 23\n18.  Government-wide guidance issued by the Office of Management and Budget \n(OMB)  states  that  the  term  “information  dissemination  product”  includes  “any  electronic \ndocument … or web page” that an agency disseminates to the public. Guidelines for Ensuring and \nMaximizing the Quality, Objectivity, Utility, and Integrity of Information Disseminated by Federal \nAgencies; Republication, 67 Fed. Reg.  8452, 8460 (Feb. 22, 2002). \nFACTS \n \n19.  In late January and February 2025, Defendants took down from their websites \nnumerous tools and pages that provided important information concerning the environment. \nDefendants provided no notice and no reasoned explanation before removing public access to the \ntools and webpages. \nEPA – EJScreen \n \n20.  First released to the public in 2015, EJScreen was an interactive mapping tool that \nprovided critical data on local pollution burdens, demographic indicators, and environmental \njustice  indicators.  EJScreen  enabled  users  to  conduct  analysis  for  different  pollutants  and \npopulations on federal, state, and city levels. As part of that analysis, EJScreen provided users with \ncolor-coded mapping, the ability to generate a report for a selected area, and comparisons showing \ndifferences between a selected area and the surrounding state, EPA region, or the nation.1 \n \n1  Exhibit  1,  Learn  to  Use  EJSCREEN  (Jan.  19,  2021),  https://19january2021 \nsnapshot.epa.gov/ejscreen/learn-use-ejscreen_.html. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 7 of 23\n \n21.  Prior to February 2025, EPA encouraged public use of EJScreen and sought to \npromote reliance on it. For example, EPA directed grant applicants to use the tool to indicate \nwhether their grants would benefit vulnerable communities. And EPA recognized that EJScreen \n“may be of interest to community residents or other stakeholders as they search for environmental \nor demographic information” and “can also support a wide range of research and policy goals.”2 \n22.  On February 5, 2025, EPA removed from its website EJScreen and webpages \nrelated to EJScreen. \n23.  Plaintiff Sierra Club regularly relied on EJScreen in its public education materials, \ncomments and testimony to federal agencies, and conversations with elected officials. For instance, \nSierra Club recently released a report that used EJScreen to demonstrate how communities would \nbe harmed by the proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project in North Carolina, and it \nprovided recommendations to North Carolina decisionmakers based on the data and analysis. \nSimilarly, in 2022, Sierra Club developed an interactive map of existing and proposed warehouses \nin the United States that are larger than 100,000 square feet, and it used EJScreen to overlay the \n \n2 Purposes and Uses of EJSCREEN (Jan. 19, 2021), https://19january2021snapshot.epa \n.gov/ejscreen/purposes-and-uses-ejscreen_.html. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 8 of 23\nmap with demographic information about residents living within a half mile of the warehouses. \nThe map and an accompanying article in Sierra Magazine raised awareness about the impact of \nthe proliferation of warehouses across the country, and the EJScreen data was essential in showing \nthat warehouse development imposes disparate burdens on communities that already bear the \nburden of a legacy of pollution. \n24.  Sierra Club also frequently used EJScreen to create maps and analyses that it used \nto support its involvement in regulatory proceedings, including comments on important federal \nClean Air Act rulemakings that determine the amount of toxic air pollution that can be released \ninto communities. Access to EJScreen was particularly important in that setting because it allowed \nSierra Club to produce comments efficiently and meet the constrained timelines that accompany \nmany comment periods. \n25.  UCS regularly relied on the EJScreen webpages, including in numerous reports it \nissued to the public. For example, in its report “Invisible Threat, Inequitable Impact,” UCS used \nEJScreen to assess and explain the environmental justice burden of ethylene oxide emissions in \ncommunities across the country and to help identify the case study communities highlighted in the \nreport.  \n26.  UCS also used EJScreen in technical assistance and education with community \npartners. For example, in its Community Guide for Cumulative Impacts, which was developed in \npartnership with community leaders, UCS provided guidance for how to use EJScreen. The \ncommunity guide also directed users to undertake a practice exercise where they use EJScreen to \nhelp understand environmental and health stressors in their communities..  \n27.  UCS planned to incorporate EJScreen into forthcoming technical analyses. For \nexample, UCS planned to incorporate EJScreen data in a research project that aims to connect \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 9 of 23\nnuclear materials exposure with public health outcomes and highlights the cumulative burdens \nfaced by nuclear frontline communities. Without access to EJScreen, UCS must alter its research \nmethodology and will be unable to include comprehensive cumulative burden data that will help \nachieve the project’s goal of improving health equity in affected communities.  \n28.  EIP relied on EJScreen weekly to conduct research and prepare public reports, \ninteractive maps, legal filings, and other materials that educate the public and decisionmakers \nabout the impacts of industrial pollution on communities. For example, EIP relied on EJScreen to \ncreate published reports on pollution from petroleum coke facilities and on harmful air pollution \nfrom new and expanded plastics plants around the country, to identify and report on environmental \nburdens and vulnerable populations living near these facilities. EIP routinely uses information \nfrom these and other EIP reports when engaging in legal advocacy to hold industrial facilities \naccountable to state and federal laws and when advocating for improvements to existing laws to \nprotect human health and the environment..  \n29.  EIP operates the website oilandgaswatch.org, which tracks the expansion of oil, \ngas, and petrochemical infrastructure around the country and alerts the public about opportunities \nto submit public comments. That website directly incorporated EJScreen data through EJScreen’s \nApplication Program Interface (API) tool, enabling EIP automatically to monitor and retrieve \ndemographic and environmental burden data from EJScreen. The API tool was removed from \nEPA’s website at the same time as EJScreen. Without access to the EJScreen API tool and \nEJScreen mapping tool, EIP can no longer automatically update the oilandgaswatch.org website, \nand it lacks the resources to do so manually. \n30.  EIP  also  used  EJScreen  as  a  consideration  in  its  decisionmaking  process  to \ndetermine how to allocate funds for technical support. To ensure that individuals and communities \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 10 of 23\ncan influence environmental decisions that affect their health and quality of life, EIP funds access \nto high-quality science and engineering expertise. EIP used both EJScreen and CEJST every month \nto evaluate the demographic, risk characteristics, and other vulnerabilities of communities where \nit provides technical assistance. \n31.  In addition, EIP relied on EJScreen as a consideration in its decisionmaking process \nto determine when it would expend resources participating in rulemaking or other regulatory \nproceedings and when deciding whether to spend money and time pursuing litigation.  \n32.  CCAT regularly relied on EJScreen to explain environmental harms to the public, \nregulators, and legislators. For example, CCAT has used EJScreen to display and explain the harms \ncaused by lead battery acid facilities and to advocate for improved regulation of the facilities. \nExposure to lead pollution can result in severe damage to the brain and nervous system, kidney \ndamage, high blood pressure, infertility and miscarriage, and learning disabilities, and lead battery \nacid facilities are often located in disadvantaged communities. CCAT has used EJScreen as part \nof its efforts to inform communities and decisionmakers about the harms these facilities inflict on \ndisadvantaged communities and to advocate for improved monitoring that would alert these \ncommunities to dangerous levels of pollution. \n33.  After EPA revoked public access to EJScreen, it issued a memorandum stating that \n“environmental justice considerations shall no longer inform EPA’s enforcement and compliance \nassurance work,” and, accordingly, that “EJScreen … has been disabled and may not be used for \nany enforcement or compliance activity.”3  \n \n3 Jeffrey Hall, Acting Assistant Administrator, Memorandum re: Implementing National \nEnforcement and Compliance Initiatives Consistently with Executive Orders and Agency Priorities \n(Mar.  12,  2025),  https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/implementingnecis \nconsistentlywitheosandagencypriorities.pdf.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 11 of 23\nCEQ – CEJST \n \n34.  Prior to January 22, 2025, CEQ maintained webpages making publicly available \nthe Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST). CEJST was an interactive mapping \ntool that identified and highlighted communities that face disproportionate environmental burdens. \nThe tool expanded on EJScreen and considered burden indicators, including energy burdens, air \nquality, higher education enrollment, formerly redlined census tracts, expected agricultural loss, \nand traffic proximity. \n35.  CEQ  regulations  recognized  the  importance  of  CEJST  and  EJScreen  and \nencouraged reliance on those tools. For example, CEQ directed agencies to use CEJST, EJScreen, \nand similar tools “[t]o assist in identifying communities with environmental justice concerns.” 40 \nC.F.R. § 1508.1(f). \n36.  On or about January 22, 2025, CEQ removed from its website CEJST and the \nwebpages related to CEJST. \n37.  Sierra Club regularly relied on CEJST to provide targeted advocacy to address the \ndisproportionate impact of environmental crises. For example, after the Maui wildfires in 2023, \nSierra Club successfully used EJScreen and CEJST in conjunction with other research to advocate \nto local health officials to prioritize the evacuation of pregnant native Hawaiian women in the third \ntrimester. From its prior experience with disasters and reviewing post-disaster data, Sierra Club \nunderstands that miscarriage and birthweight are tied to pollution. With that knowledge, Sierra \nClub used the census block-level precision datasets from CEJST and EJScreen to identify the \nhigher acute risk from wildfire pollution to Maui’s most vulnerable population and to communicate \nthat information to the Hawaii Department of Health in calls and meetings.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 12 of 23\n38.  UCS regularly relied on CEJST to conduct technical analyses that it disseminated \nto the public. For example, UCS relied on CEJST to develop reports on the disadvantaged \ncommunities that are particularly vulnerable to impacts from increased coastal flooding and on \nwhether the government was making infrastructure investments in disadvantaged communities. \nThe removal of CEJST greatly impairs UCS’s ability to produce national-scale analyses related to \nclimate and environmental justice. \n39.  EIP also regularly relied on CEJST, including to conduct research and prepare \npublic reports, interactive maps, and other materials that educate the public and decisionmakers \nabout the impacts of industrial pollution on communities. For example, EIP relied on CEJST to \ndevelop and regularly update an interactive map of existing and proposed CO2 pipelines and to \npublish reports on the harms from petcoke facilities and aluminum manufacturing facilities. EIP \nalso used CEJST several times a month as a consideration when deciding how to allocate funds \nfor technical support. \n40.  CCAT  regularly  relied  on  CEJST  to  determine  the  impact  of  pollution  on \ndisadvantaged  communities  and  to  assist  those  communities  in  advocating  against  the \nenvironmental and health harms they are suffering. For example, in 2024, a CCAT analysis \ndetermined that copper smelters in Arizona were emitting enormous quantities of lead via the air. \nIn regulating that pollution, EPA had ignored the impact on the San Carlos Apache Tribe. Using \nEJScreen and CEJST, CCAT was able to identify the extent of the disproportionate impact on the \nSan Carlos Apache Tribe, who were then able to use that data to advocate for regulations that \nwould protect the health of their community and the environment. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 13 of 23\n41.  After removing access to CEJST, CEQ issued a memorandum stating that agencies \nshould not include “an environmental justice analysis” when undertaking environmental impact \nreviews.4 \nDOE – LEAD Tool \n \n42.  Until late January 2025, DOE maintained webpages related to the Low-Income \nEnergy Affordability Data (LEAD) Tool. The LEAD tool was an interactive mapping tool that \nhelped users understand and compare the cost of energy relative to income, for various geographic \nregions, including census tracts, cities, counties, states, tribal lands, and the entire United States. \nDOE specifically created the tool to improve knowledge about housing and energy characteristics \nfor low- and moderate-income communities. \n43.  Between January 25, 2025, and January 29, 2025, DOE removed from its website \nthe LEAD tool and pages related to it. \n44.  The LEAD Tool was central to Sierra Club’s work to protect public health, climate, \nand public lands. For instance, Sierra Club used the LEAD tool to analyze how liquid natural gas \nbuild-out increases energy bills and contributes to disproportionate energy burdens on low-income \nhouseholds.  \n45.  Sierra  Club  also  used  the  LEAD  tool  in  reports  that  develop  regional \nrecommendations to alleviate the energy burden for vulnerable households. For example, Sierra \nClub used the LEAD tool to produce its St. Louis Energy Burden Report, which highlights racial \nand economic disparities in energy burden in the city, and Missouri Energy Burden Explorer, an \ninteractive map that presents energy burden data by census tract, as well as data on income, race, \n \n4 Katherine R. Scarlett, Chief of Staff, Memorandum re: Implementation of the National \nEnvironmental  Policy  Act  (Feb.  19,  2025),  https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/ceq-regulations-and-\nguidance/CEQ-Memo-Implementation-of-NEPA-02.19.2025.pdf. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 14 of 23\nand respiratory illness rates. Those reports have been vital both to Sierra Club’s advocacy and to \nits decisions about how and where to allocate resources. \n46.  UCS regularly relied on the LEAD tool. For example, UCS relied on the LEAD \ntool in its ongoing efforts to produce reports about how decarbonization and a cleaner electric grid \nmay affect energy access and affordability.  \nDOE – Community Benefits Plan Map \n \n47.  DOE created the Community Benefits Plan Map to allow local communities to \nbetter understand what DOE projects are being developed in their area so that community members \nand other advocates can engage more effectively with the projects. The Community Benefits Plan \nMap provided information about the location of DOE-funded projects and the community benefits \nexpected to derive from those projects. \n48.  On January 23, 2025, DOE issued a memorandum “directing a suspension of … \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies, procedures, programs, activities, and reviews \ninvolving or relating to DEI objectives and principles … [and of actions] requiring, using, or \nenforcing Community Benefits Plans.”5  \n49.  Between January 25, 2025, and January 29, 2025, DOE removed from its website \nthe Community Benefits Plan Map and pages related to it.  \n50.  Sierra Club relied on the Community Benefits Plan Map in its work supporting the \nnecessary  transition  of  the  most  polluting  industries  to  cleaner,  greener  technologies  while \npreserving and growing high-paying jobs. For example, Sierra Club recently used the Community \n \n5 Ingrid C. Kolb, Acting Secretary, Memorandum re: Executive Order on Ending Radical \nand Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, and Agency-Wide Policy to Promote \nEqual  Opportunity  (Jan.  23,  2025),  https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-\n02/Memorandum%20signed%20by%20Acting%20Secretary%20of%20Energy%20Ingrid%20C.\n%20Kolb%20dated%20January%2023%202025%20%28002%29.pdf \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 15 of 23\nBenefit Plans Map as part of its efforts to ensure that potential DOE-funded projects not only \ndelivered climate benefits but also local air and water quality benefits, and addressed other needs \nof manufacturing communities. Sierra Club used the webpages to understand the communities \nimpacted by the projects, to reach out to those communities to encourage them to engage in the \npublic process, and to engage in the public process itself. \nDOT – ETC Explorer \n \n51.  DOT’s Equitable Transportation Community (ETC) Explorer was an interactive \nmapping tool that compiled location data based on transportation insecurity, climate and disaster \nrisk burden, environmental burden, health vulnerability, and social vulnerability. It served as a \ncomplement to CEJST and helped explain the cumulative burden that communities experience \nfrom underinvestment in transportation. \n52.  On its website, DOT recognized that the ETC Explorer was intended to permit users \nto understand the transportation-related causes of disadvantage. \n53.  Between January 26, 2025, and February 1, 2025, DOT removed from its website \nthe ETC Explorer and pages related to it. \n54.  The ETC Explorer has been instrumental in Sierra Club’s work related to public \ntransportation  projects  meant  to  allow  all  communities  to  access  green  spaces  and  public \nrecreational amenities. Sierra Club used the ETC Explorer and EJScreen to identify public transit \nroutes that connect underserved communities to green spaces like trails, parks, and nature areas; \nto encourage municipalities to advertise their existing routes as “transit to trails” options; and to \npromote legislation that would create or improve transportation between underserved communities \nand public lands.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 16 of 23\n55.  Sierra Club also regularly used the ETC Explorer to identify gaps in public transit \navailability and, in conjunction with EJScreen, to determine where to allocate its resources for \npublic transportation projects. \nFEMA – Future Risk Index \n \n56.  FEMA’s Future Risk Index was an interactive mapping tool that provided projected \neconomic losses due to climate change at the county level, based on different greenhouse gas \nemission  scenarios  and  environmental  hazards  (coastal  flooding,  extreme  heat,  wildfire, \nhurricanes, and drought). The Future Risk Index served as a supplement to FEMA’s National Risk \nIndex and provided free, one-of-a-kind information about how much climate change is likely to \ncost communities in the United States. \n57.  In February 2025, FEMA removed from its website the Future Risk Index and \npages related to it. \n58.  When the pages were posted, UCS used the Future Risk Index webpages for \nscoping technical analyses, and UCS had been considering integrating the tool into a forthcoming \nanalysis on affordable housing.  \nInjury to Plaintiffs \n \n59.  Defendants’  decisions  to  remove  the  webpages  are  causing  and  will  cause \nsubstantial harm to Plaintiffs. As set forth above, Plaintiffs relied and, absent Defendants’ removal, \nwould  continue  to  rely  heavily  on  the  removed  webpages  to  explain  to  communities, \ndecisionmakers, and the media the harms suffered by disadvantaged groups, and how policy \nchoices can exacerbate or ameliorate those harms; to engage with regulatory processes; and to \ndecide how and where to allocate their scarce resources. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 17 of 23\n60.  Without the information provided by the removed webpages, Plaintiffs have had to \nhalt work on reports intended for public dissemination and are impeded in their ability to identify \ncommunities that face disproportionate environmental burdens, to communicate how policies will \nimpact those communities, and to target resources to aid disadvantaged communities. \n61.  Defendants’ removal of access to the webpages makes it harder for Plaintiffs to \ndisseminate accurate information about the impacts of industrial air and water pollution on human \nhealth  and  the  environment  to  the  general  public,  impacted  communities,  organizations, \ndecisionmakers, and the media. For example, they cannot publish reports with the same detailed \ndata or must seek out alternative sources of information for their reports that are less convenient \nand less reliable. \n62.  The  webpage  removals  also  hamper  the  ability  of  Plaintiffs  to  participate  in \nregulatory processes. Because many public comment periods are only open for 30 days, it is \nessential for potential commenters to have access to tools that allow them to quickly assess the \nimpact of proposals on the environment and disadvantaged communities. By removing web pages, \nDefendants have increased the burden on members of the public, including Plaintiffs, that seek to \nparticipate in the regulatory process. Plaintiffs must therefore expend additional resources to \nparticipate in ostensibly open government proceedings. \n63.  Plaintiffs do not have access to alternative sources of information that provide the \nsame level of standardization, reliability, precision, and functionality as the removed webpages. \nPlaintiffs do not have access to alternatives that offer a consistent, reliable methodology used by \npartner organizations and state and federal agencies. \n64.  Some  of  the  removed  webpages  compiled  information  from  numerous  other \nsources. For example, EJScreen combined numerous datasets that originated from the Census \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 18 of 23\nBureau,  EPA,  the  Federal  Highway  Administration,  and  other  agencies.  Collecting  that \ninformation would require Plaintiffs to invest significant time and resources and could not be done \nin a timely manner. In addition, if Plaintiffs were able to access the data, combining it would \npresent technical and data management challenges that would also require Plaintiffs to expend \nadditional resources. \n65.  Because  Defendants  have  removed  the  webpages,  Plaintiffs  must  now  either \nexpend additional time and resources to determine how to serve their target populations or face a \ngreater risk that their investment of time, money, and resources will go to naught.  \nCOUNT I \n(By All Plaintiffs Against EPA) \n \n66.

INTRODUCTION \nWhen President Trump came into office, some federal agencies removed certain pages \nfrom their public websites.  Four non-profit advocacy organizations have sued the Environmental \nProtection Agency, the Council on Environmental Quality, the Department of Transportation, \nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency (collectively, “Defendants”) for deleting \nwebpages that provided important information concerning the environment.  They allege that the \ndeletions violate the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq., and the \nPaperwork Reduction Act (“the Act”), 44 U.S.C. §3501 et seq.  Plaintiffs have moved for a \npreliminary injunction requiring Defendants to restore the deleted webpages.  For the reasons \ndiscussed below, the Court denies the motion. \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Factual Background \nThis case concerns four government webpages that had, until January and February of \nthis year, “provided information about the environment and public health” through interactive \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 2 of 12\ndata tools.  Mem. Law Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. (“Mot. Prelim. Inj.”) at 2, ECF No. 20-1.  \nThe webpages were “authoritative, regularly updated resources that were centralized and \naccessible.”  See Proposed Amicus Curiae Br. Chesapeake Bay Found. Supp. Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. \nInj. at 9 (“Chesapeake Bay Found. Amicus Br.”), ECF No. 26-1.  According to one \nenvironmental advocacy organization, “[t]he data was valuable not only for the trends it revealed \nbut also for its ability to democratize conversations about the intersection of environmental harm \nand historical injustices.”  Id.  Beginning in January, Defendants removed the webpages and the \n“behind-the-scenes webpages and datasets necessary for the interactive pages to function.”  Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. at 2.  The Court describes each deleted tool in turn.   \nEJScreen.  First released to the public in 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency’s \n(“EPA”) EJScreen was an online “interactive mapping tool” that provided data on local pollution \nburdens, demographic indicators, and environmental justice indicators.  Id. (citing EPA, How \nwas EJSCREEN Developed? (Jan. 19, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/Q6DP-98SK).  It \nconstituted “a nationally consistent dataset and approach for combining environmental and \ndemographic indicators.”  EPA, What is EJSCREEN? (Jan. 19, 2021), available at \nhttps://perma.cc/7UPR-MURP).  EJScreen aggregated data from a variety of sources, including \nthe U.S. Census Bureau, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National \nAssociation for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, the Department of Agriculture, and EPA.  Defs.’ Opp’n to Pls.’ Mot. Prelim. Inj. \n(“Defs.’ Opp’n”) at 2, ECF No. 29.  \nEPA created EJScreen “to be more transparent about how we consider environmental \njustice in our work, []to assist our stakeholders in making informed decisions about pursuing \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 3 of 12\nenvironmental justice and []to create a common starting point between the agency and the public \nwhen looking at issues related to environmental justice.”  EPA, Purposes and Uses of \nEJSCREEN (Jan. 19, 2021), available at https://perma.cc/J4RA-ESG9.  According to Plaintiffs, \n“EJScreen enabled users to analyze the demographic characteristics and environmental burdens \nof communities at a granular level.”  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 3.  As an illustrative example, one of \nthe Plaintiff organizations had consistently used EJScreen to “conduct research and prepare \npublic reports, interactive maps, legal filings, and other materials [to] educate the public and \ndecision-makers about the impacts of industrial pollution on communities.”  Decl. of Jennifer \nDuggan (“Duggan Decl.”) ¶¶ 8, 11, ECF No. 20-5.   \nOn February 5, 2025, EPA removed from its website EJScreen, webpages that supported \nits functionality, and the EJScreen Application Program Interface tool, which allowed the public \nto automatically collect EJScreen’s data at scale.  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 2; Decl. of Patrick Grenter \n(“Grenter Decl.”) ¶ 7, ECF No. 20-3; Duggan Decl. ¶ 6.  EPA has since posted some of the \nEJScreen data to a public repository, but Plaintiffs claim “those datasets are not nearly as \nfunctional or useful” as EJScreen itself.  See Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 3; see also Defs.’ Opp’n at 2 \n(noting that the EJScreen code is available online as a public archive).   \nClimate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (“Screening Tool”).  Like EJScreen, \nthe Council on Environmental Quality’s (“CEQ”) Screening Tool “was an interactive mapping \ntool that identified and highlighted communities that face disproportionate environmental \nburdens using a consistent nationwide methodology.”1  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 4.  It encompassed \ndifferent environmental and demographic indicators than EJScreen, combining datasets on \n \n1 The CEQ is an advisory agency within the Executive Office of the President.

See \nM-23-09 Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, Addendum to the \nInterim Implementation Guidance for the Justice40 Initiative, M-21-28, on using the Climate and \nEconomic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) (Jan. 27, 2023), available at https://perma.cc/733J-\nY5PL.  The Screening Tool used data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency \n(“FEMA”), the First Street Foundation, the U.S. Census Bureau, and other sources, including the \npublic.  Defs.’ Opp’n at 6–7.  CEQ removed CEJST and its supporting webpages and datasets \nfrom its website on January 22, 2025.  Grenter Decl. ¶ 7.  The Screening Tool’s underlying code \nremains available online.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 7; Decl. of Jocelyn D’Ambrosio (“D’Ambrosio \nDecl.”) Ex. 1 at 30, ECF No. 29-4. \nEquitable Transportation Community Explorer (“ETC Explorer”).  The ETC \nExplorer was an interactive mapping tool published by the Department of Transportation \n(“DOT”) that “compiled location data based on transportation insecurity, climate and disaster \nrisk burden, environmental burden, health vulnerability, and social vulnerability.”  Mot. Prelim. \nInj. at 6; Decl. of Juli Huynh (“Huynh Decl.”) ¶ 3, ECF No. 29-6.  It was designed to allow \n“every community in the country to understand how it is experiencing burden that transportation \ninvestments can mitigate or reverse.”  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 6.  Between January 26 and February \n1, 2025, DOT removed from its website the original ETC Explorer and the affiliated webpages \nand datasets.  Grenter Decl. ¶ 7.  The tool has since been updated with new methodology and \ndata, and now contains slightly different indices.

FEMA published the Future Risk Index, an interactive mapping tool \nthat “provided projected economic losses due to climate change at the county level, based on \ndifferent climate scenarios and environmental hazards, including coastal flooding, extreme heat, \nwildfire, hurricanes, and drought.”  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 6.   It “provided one-of-a-kind \ninformation about how much climate change is likely to cost communities in the United States.”  \nId. at 7.  FEMA deleted the Future Risk Index in February 2025.  Decl. of Pallavi Phartiyal \n(“Pharityal Decl.”) ¶ 5, ECF No. 20-4.  \nB.  Procedural Background \nOn April 14, Plaintiffs Sierra Club, Union of Concerned Scientists, Environmental \nIntegrity Project, and California Communities Against Toxics initiated this action against EPA, \nCEQ, DOT, and FEMA.2  See generally Compl., ECF No. 1.  The Plaintiff organizations had \nused the deleted webpages “to investigate environmental harms and educate the public, to guide \nwhere they directed their technical expertise and funding, and to engage with public officials.”  \nMot. Prelim. Inj. at 7 (citing Grenter Decl. ¶¶ 9–33; Phartiyal Decl. ¶¶ 7–12; Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 7–\n27; Decl. of Jane Williams (“Williams Decl.”) ¶¶ 5–16, ECF No. 20-6).  The complaint has four \noperative counts, one against each Defendant agency.  Compl. ¶¶ 66–95.  Each count states that \nthe deleted webpages and tools are “significant information dissemination products” under the \nPaperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. § 3506(d)(3).  Id. ¶¶ 67, 73, 85, 91; see also 67 Fed. Reg. \n8452, 8460 (Feb. 22, 2002) (defining the term “information dissemination product” to include \n“any electronic document . . . or web page” that an agency disseminates to the public).  Plaintiffs \n \n2 Originally Plaintiffs also challenged the removal of two online tools from the \nDepartment of Energy’s (“DOE”) website, see Compl. ¶¶ 13, 47–50, 78–83, but they have since \nvoluntarily dismissed their claims against DOE.  See Notice of Voluntary Dismissal of Def. \nDep’t of Energy, ECF No. 33.   \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 6 of 12\nclaim that because Defendants did not provide advance public notice before removing the \nwebpages, they failed to comply with the Act’s requirement that an agency must “provide \nadequate notice when initiating, substantially modifying, or terminating significant information \ndissemination products.”  Compl. ¶¶ 68, 74, 86, 92 (citing 44 U.S.C. § 3506(d)(3)).  They also \nclaim that in removing access to the interactive webpages, Defendants failed to comply with the \nAct’s mandate that an agency “ensure that the public has timely and equitable access to the \nagency’s public information,”; that Defendants’ decisions to remove the webpages lacked \nreasonable explanations; and that Defendants failed to engage in reasoned decisionmaking as \nrequired by the APA.  Id. ¶¶ 69–71, 75–77, 87–89, 93–95.  Plaintiffs request that the Court \ndeclare that Defendants’ removal of the webpages violates the Act and the APA; order \nDefendants to restore the removed webpages; and award them costs and attorneys’ fees.  Id. at \n22.  \nOver one month after filing their complaint, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction \nthat would require Defendants to restore the deleted webpages.  Mot. Prelim. Inj.  Defendants \nfiled an opposition and Plaintiffs filed a reply.  Defs.’ Opp’n; Reply Mem. Law Supp. Pls.’ Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. (“Pls.’ Reply”), ECF No. 32.  Chesapeake Bay Foundation, a conservation \norganization, filed an amicus brief in support of Plaintiffs.  See Chesapeake Bay Found. Amicus \nBr.  The motion for preliminary injunction is now ripe for review.   \nIII.  LEGAL STANDARD \n“A preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the [movant] is entitled to such relief.’”  John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot.  \nBureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that he is \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 7 of 12\nlikely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is in \nthe public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “The last two factors ‘merge when the Government \nis the opposing party.’”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & Explosives, 920 \nF.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  “Of course, the \nmovant carries the burden of persua[ding]” the Court that these factors merit preliminary relief, \nFla. EB5 Invs., LLC v. Wolf, 443 F. Supp. 3d 7, 11 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing Cobell v. Norton, 391 \nF.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), and must do so by making a “clear showing,” Cobell, 391 F.3d \nat 258.  If a movant does not show irreparable harm, the Court can deny the motion for injunctive \nrelief without reaching the other preliminary injunction factors.  CityFed Fin. Corp. v. Off. of \nThrift Supervision, 58 F.3d 738, 747 (D.C. Cir. 1995); Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Energy Regul. \nComm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674, 676 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam).   \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA preliminary injunction is “never awarded as of right” and can only issue upon “a clear \nshowing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22, 24.  The Court \nagrees with Defendants that Plaintiffs have not made such a showing. \n  First, to the extent Plaintiffs used the deleted webpages to “assess where to allocate their \nlimited resources,” the resulting harm—greater resource-allocation costs—is essentially \neconomic.  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 17.  It is “well settled that economic loss does not, in and of itself, \nconstitute irreparable harm.”  Wis. Gas Co., 758 F.2d at 674.  The costs Plaintiffs have expended \nand will expend in seeking out alternative data and tools also do not qualify as irreparable harm.  \nSee Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 20 (describing how, without the eliminated webpages, Plaintiffs may \nhave to “spend time disputing the reliability of [other] data sources” and that some of Plaintiffs’ \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 8 of 12\nwork “will either be halted or will require additional time and resources”); Pls.’ Reply at 2 \n(“Since their removal, Plaintiffs have expended substantial effort seeking alternative resources, \nbut they have been unable to find satisfactory alternatives.”); see also Grenter Decl. ¶ 37 \n(describing how the deletion of the tools will require expending additional resources); Phartiyal \nDecl. ¶ 15 (same); Duggan Decl. ¶¶ 16, 35 (same); Williams Decl. ¶ 21 (same).  The Court \ncredits Plaintiffs’ position that the tools at issue in this case were “uniquely useful,” and that \nwithout them Plaintiffs will need to “‘invest considerably more of [their] limited time, money, \nand effort’ to obtain the same information.”  Pls.’ Reply at 5; Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 22 (quoting \nGrenter Decl. ¶ 35); see also Pls.’ Reply at 5–6 (explaining that Plaintiffs would have to invest \nmore resources to rebuild the tools based on the limited source code currently available and that \nthird party attempts to recreate the tools are incomplete).  But “[m]ere injuries, however \nsubstantial, in terms of money, time, and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay \nare not enough.”  Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. Fed. Power Comm’n, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. \nCir. 1958).  At most, Defendants’ actions have made it marginally more difficult for Plaintiffs to \nadvance certain initiatives, including providing information and resources to the public.  That is \nnot the type of harm that courts typically recognize as irreparable.3  Cf. Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 394–95 (2024) (holding that organizations do not suffer \na cognizable injury when they “divert[] resources in response to a defendant’s actions”).  \n \n3 The Court also agrees with Defendants that any downstream effects that may be borne \nby unnamed third parties, including the public, do not constitute irreparable harm.  See Defs.’ \nOpp’n at 26–27; see also, e.g., Church v. Biden, 573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 146 (D.D.C. 2021) \n(“Abstract harm that might befall unnamed third parties does not satisfy the irreparable harm \nrequirement in the context of emergency injunctive relief, which must instead be connected \nspecifically to the parties before the Court.”). \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 9 of 12\nThe Court’s conclusion is “bolstered” by the fact that Plaintiffs waited until long after the \nsubject webpages were removed to seek injunctive relief.  See Defs.’ Opp’n at 20–21.  Other \ncourts have found that “[a]n unexcused delay in seeking extraordinary injunctive \nrelief . . . implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.”  Open Top Sightseeing USA v. Mr. \nSightseeing, LLC, 48 F. Supp. 3d 87, 90 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting Newdow v. Bush, 355 F. Supp. \n2d 265, 292 (D.D.C. 2005)); see also Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 724–25 (D.C. Cir. 2011) \n(holding that while a delay in filing cannot be the sole basis for denial of a preliminary \ninjunction, delay can “support a conclusion that the plaintiff cannot satisfy the irreparable harm \nprong”).  That principle applies here. \nMost of the webpages at issue in this case were removed from Defendants’ public \nwebsites in late January and early February.4  See Compl. ¶¶ 22, 36, 53 (noting that EJScreen \nwas removed on February 5, 2025; that the Screening Tool was removed on January 22, 2025; \nand that the ETC Explorer tool was removed by February 1, 2025).  Plaintiffs filed their \ncomplaint on April 14—over two months after most of the tools were deleted, and at least one \nand a half months after the last tool was deleted.  See Compl.  And they moved for preliminary \ninjunctive relief over one month after that.  See Mot. Prelim. Inj. (filed on May 16, 2025).    \nPlaintiffs’ intentional delay is in tension with the high bar they must clear to establish \nirreparable harm.  E.g., Mylan Pharms., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. 2d 30, 44 (D.D.C. 2000) \n(noting that delay of two months in seeking injunctive relief “militates against a finding of \nirreparable harm”); cf. Washington Post v. Dep’t Homeland Sec., 459 F. Supp. 2d 61, 74–75 \n(D.D.C. 2006) (emphasizing the urgency of a plaintiff’s request while granting preliminary \n \n4 Plaintiffs do not know when in the month of February FEMA removed the Future Risk \nIndex.  See Compl. ¶ 57.   \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 10 of 12\ninjunctive relief).  The D.C. Circuit has held that a party’s “inexcusable” forty-four day delay in \nseeking a preliminary injunction “bolstered” the conclusion that “an injunction should not issue.”  \nFund for Animals v. Frizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  Plaintiffs’ delay of around 100 \ndays is similarly inexcusable.   \nPlaintiffs’ arguments otherwise are unavailing.  See Pls.’ Reply at 7–8.  First they point \nout that they took time to search for alternative data sources before concluding that “[t]here are \nno adequate substitutes available for the eliminated federal tools.”  Id. (citing Grenter Decl. ¶ 36; \nWilliams Decl. ¶ 36; Duggan Decl. ¶ 30).  Fair enough.  But Plaintiffs do not claim to have \ninitiated this lawsuit immediately upon reaching that conclusion.  And even so, they waited over \none month after filing the complaint to move for a preliminary injunction.  Their “failure to act \nsooner undercuts the sense of urgency that ordinarily accompanies a motion for preliminary \ninjunctive relief and suggests that there is, in fact, no irreparable injury.”  Citibank, N.A. v. \nCitytrust, 756 F.2d 273, 277 (2d Cir. 1985) (citation omitted).  \nNext Plaintiffs claim that their delay was reasonable because (1) in some instances, when \nagencies had revoked access to public information, they self-corrected “shortly thereafter”; and \n(2) in other instances, agencies “changed course after a lawsuit was filed but before a court \nruled.”  Pls.’ Reply at 8.  Plaintiffs made a tactical decision to wait to see if the government \nwould “moot[] this case in its entirety,” one way or another.  Id.  That choice is inconsistent with \ntheir position that they are now suffering irreparable harm.  For a harm to be irreparable, it must \nbe “‘certain and great,’ ‘actual and not theoretical,’ and so ‘imminent that there is a clear and \npresent need for equitable relief to prevent [it].’”  League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 7–8 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 \nF.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006)).  For around 100 days Plaintiffs apparently concluded that there \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 11 of 12\nwas no “clear and present need” for court-ordered relief.  That position contradicts their \nargument that now, suddenly, there is such a need. \nPlaintiffs also state in a conclusory fashion that “none of the fact-specific findings in the \nother [inexcusable delay] cases cited by Defendants resemble the facts here.”  Pls.’ Reply at 9 \n(citing Defs.’ Opp’n at 21).  That does nothing to justify their delay. \nPlaintiffs attempt to distinguish the facts of this case from a leading case that Defendants \ncite, Newdow v. Bush, 355 F. Supp. 2d 265 (D.D.C. 2005), in support of their position that \nPlaintiffs have not shown irreparable harm.  Pls.’ Reply at 9.  In Newdow, the preliminary relief \nthe plaintiff sought would have also constituted the ultimate relief in the case, which is generally \ndisfavored.  Id. (citing Newdow, 355 F. Supp. 2d at 292); see also Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, \n451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (“[I]t is generally inappropriate for a federal court at the preliminary \ninjunction stage to give a final judgment on the merits.”).  And in Newdow the court found that \nthe plaintiff’s delay in “in seeking a preliminary injunction has placed defendants and the federal \ncourts in a difficult position.”  Newdow, 355 F. Supp. 2d at 292.  Defendants have not argued \nthat the preliminary relief Plaintiffs seek would be tantamount to the final relief, or that the \ntiming of Plaintiffs’ motion caused them prejudice.  Id.  But that is immaterial because it is \nPlaintiffs’ burden to establish irreparable harm.  See Cobell, 391 F.3d at 258.   \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  Because \nPlaintiffs have not clearly established irreparable harm, the Court will deny their motion without \nconsidering the other preliminary injunction factors.  See CityFed Fin. Corp., 58 F.3d at 747. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01112-RC     Document 35     Filed 07/09/25     Page 12 of 12\nV.  CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.  \nAn order consistent with this Memorandum Opinion is separately and contemporaneously issued. \nDated:  July 9, 2025  RUDOLPH CONTRERAS \n  United States District Judge \n12 ",
