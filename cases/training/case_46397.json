    "summary": "<p>This case concerns a lawful permanent resident who was arrested and detained while attending a naturalization interview by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in retaliation for his outspoken criticism and protest of Israel&rsquo;s military actions in Gaza. On April 14, 2025, Mohsen Mahdawi filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont, challenging his detention. Mahdawi&mdash;who has lived in the U.S. for over a decade, is a recent student of Columbia University, with an expected graduation date of May 2025, and is set to begin graduate studies at Columbia&rsquo;s School of International and Public Affairs in Fall 2025&mdash;was arrested by DHS agents while attending his naturalization interview. The named respondents include President Trump, Secretary Rubio, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pamela Bondi, and multiple ICE officials. The petition alleges that Mahdawi's detention is part of a broader policy adopted by the Trump administration to retaliate against noncitizens for engaging in constitutionally protected speech that is critical of Israel and supportive of Palestinian rights.</p>\r\n<p>The petition listed <a href=\"../../../../case/46294/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ozturk v. Hyde, 2:25-cv-00374</a>, as related, so the case was initially assigned to that case's judge, William Sessions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to the petition, the administration's policy was formalized through Executive Orders 14161 and 14188 and operationalized through a discretionary practice wherein noncitizens are deemed deportable if Secretary of State Marco Rubio determines that their&nbsp;presence has adverse foreign policy consequences. Mr. Mahdawi&rsquo;s arrest follows the detention of Mahmoud Khalil under similar circumstances.</p>\r\n<p>Mahdawi seeks immediate release and raises claims under the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the non-delegation doctrine. He also challenges the legality and constitutionality of the government&rsquo;s underlying policy and the so-called &ldquo;Rubio Determination&rdquo; used to justify his detention.</p>\r\n<p>On the same day that he filed the petition, Mahdawi also filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent his deportation. Judge Sessions granted the motion, enjoining the respondents from removing Mahdawi from the United States or transferring him out of the District of Vermont.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 15, 2025, the court found that the case was not properly considered related to Ozturk v. Hyde; accordingly, it was randomly reassigned to District Judge Geoffrey William Crawford, who set a status conference date of April 23, 2025.&nbsp; The day before the conference, Mahdawi filed a motion seeking release on bond. After the conference, Judge Crawford made several orders:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>He set a hearing date for April 30, 2025, on the issue of release, and ordered the government to bring Mahdawi to that hearing.</li>\r\n<li>He converted the government's response to the petition to a motion to dismiss, and set a briefing schedule for it.</li>\r\n<li>He extended the TRO for 90 days or until the case was dismissed or a ruling was made on the preliminary injunction.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2025, the court ordered Mahdawi released immediately and denied the government's motion for a stay. His release was ordered because his detention had become unreasonably prolonged, with no realistic prospect of removal to Iraq. The government failed to show he was a danger or flight risk, and his continued detention without progress or due process violated his constitutional rights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 1, 2025, the government appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On May 9, the Second Circuit denied a stay of the release order, holding that the government's jurisdictional arguments were unlikely to succeed. It found no irreparable harm to the government and ruled that the balance of equities and public interest favored Mahdawi's release.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 18, in the Second Circuit, Defendant-Appellants filed a petition for rehearing en banc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

Petitioner Mohsen Mahdawi is a lawful permanent resident of the United States on \nthe pathway to naturalization. He has held a green card for the past ten years. This case concerns \nthe government’s retaliatory and targeted detention and attempted removal of Mr. Mahdawi for his \nconstitutionally protected speech.  \n2.  Mr. Mahdawi was born and raised in a refugee camp in the West Bank, where he \nlived until he moved to the United States in 2014. Mr. Mahdawi recently attended Columbia \nUniversity, and he intends to return for a master’s degree in fall of 2025. As a student at Columbia, \n1 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 2 of 19\nMr. Mahdawi was an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist and \norganizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024, after which he took a \nstep back and has not been involved in organizing.   \n3.  On April 14, 2025, Mr. Mahdawi was arrested and detained by agents from the \nDepartment of Homeland Security (“DHS”), despite the fact that he is a lawful permanent resident. \n4.  Mr. Mahdawi’s unlawful arrest and detention comes after Respondents adopted a \npolicy (“the Policy”) on or before March 8, 2025, to retaliate and punish noncitizens for their \nspeech and expressive conduct related to Palestine and Israel. Under the Policy, Respondent Marco \nRubio,  the  Secretary  of  State,  has  unilateral  power  to  issue  determinations  (“Rubio \nDeterminations”) that the presence or activities in the United States of individuals who protested \nor were outspoken critics of Israel would have potentially serious foreign policy consequences and \nwould  compromise  a  compelling  United  States  foreign  policy  interest.  Based  on  these \ndeterminations, the Department of Homeland Security would seek to detain and deport these \nindividuals.  \n5.  It appears that Respondents seek to base Mr. Mahdawi’s removal on the Rubio \nDetermination and Section 237(a)(4)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, a rarely-used \nprovision that Respondents recently used to detain another lawful permanent resident, Mahmoud \nKhalil, for similar speech.   \n6.  Prior to and following Mr. Mahdawi’s detention, the government has made clear \nthat it intends to retaliate and punish individuals such as Mr. Mahdawi who advocated for ceasefire \nand ending the bloodshed in Gaza. Respondents’ actions plainly violate the First Amendment, \nwhich protects Mr. Mahdawi’s right to speak on matters of public concern and prevents the \ngovernment from chilling constitutionally-protected speech.  \n2 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 3 of 19\n7.  In  addition  to  violating  Mr.  Mahdawi’s  First Amendment  rights,  the  Rubio \nDetermination and Mr. Mahdawi’s unlawful detention also violates Mr. Mahdawi’s statutory rights \nand due process rights.  \nPARTIES \n8.

An actual and justiciable controversy exists between the parties under 28 U.S.C. § \n2201 and this Court has authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief. Id. § 2201, 22023. The \nCourt has additional remedial authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651. \n17.  Venue is proper in the District of Vermont under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and 28 U.S.C. § \n1391. At the time this proceeding was initiated, Mr. Mahdawi was detained at 463 Mountain View \nDrive, Colchester, VT 05446. The petitioner has been and is presently being detained at the \ndirection of Respondent Hyde and/or the Vermont sub-office Director, and a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to this petition occurred within this district.  \nFACTS \nBackground on Mr. Mahdawi  \n \n18.  Mr. Mahdawi is Palestinian. He is also a lawful permanent resident of the United \nStates, and has been for the last ten years.   \n19.  Mr. Mahdawi was born in a refugee camp in the West Bank.  In 2015, he became a \nlawful permanent resident of the United States.  \n20.  In 2018, Mr. Mahdawi enrolled in Lehigh University in Pennsylvania, where he \nstudied computer science for two years before transferring into Columbia University in 2021 to \nstudy philosophy. Mr. Mahdawi completed his program at Columbia in 2024 and has an expected \n5 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 6 of 19\ngraduation date of May 2025. Mr. Mahdawi plans to begin a Master’s of International Affairs in \nfall of 2025 at the Columbia School of International and Public Affairs.  \nMr. Mahdawi’s Speech on Matters of Public Concern \n21.  After growing up in a refugee camp,  Mr. Mahdawi felt compelled to advocate for \nPalestinian human rights upon moving to the United States.  \n22.  Mr. Mahdawi is also a committed Buddhist and believes in non-violence and \nempathy as a central tenet of his religion. In fall of 2021, he became the president of the Columbia \nUniversity Buddhist Association and led it for two years.  \n23.  In fall of 2023, Mr. Mahdawi co-founded the Palestinian Student Union (“Dar”) at \nColumbia University which “serves to engage with and celebrate Palestinian culture, history, and \nidentity.” Mr. Mahdawi co-founded this organization with Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian lawful \npermanent resident who was also recently detained by ICE for his expressive conduct related to \nPalestine.  \n24.  Before October of 2023, Mr. Mahdawi had advocated for a peaceful resolution \nbetween  Israelis  and  Palestinians  in  different  forms  such  as  public  speeches,  community \nengagement, and storytelling initiatives. Following October of 2023, Mr. Mahdawi attended \nprotests opposing military escalations in the region and advocating for Palestinian human rights \nand a peaceful political solution. Mr. Mahdawi gave speeches at several of these protests. In his \nspeeches, Mr. Mahdawi advocated for Palestinian human rights, a permanent ceasefire, and a \npeaceful resolution that affirmed the human dignity of all. \n25.  During one protest, Mr. Mahdawi vocally denounced an unaffiliated passerby who \nmade an antisemitic comment, chanting “shame on him”. Mr. Mahdawi stated that “we are against \n6 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 7 of 19\nantisemitism because antisemitism is a form of injustice, and injustice anywhere is a threat to \njustice everywhere.” The confrontation was documented by the Columbia Spectator.1  \n26.  Mr. Mahdawi appeared in numerous televised interviews and print news articles \nregarding the military campaign in Gaza and related protests. In December of 2023, Mr. Mahdawi \nappeared on 60 Minutes where he shared that, as a child, he watched an Israeli soldier shoot and \nkill his best friend in the West Bank.  \n27.  Throughout his time as a student and a leader of Dar and the Columbia University \nBuddhist Association, Mr. Mahdawi was always willing to engage in dialogue with people whose \nviews and beliefs differed from his own. Mr. Mahdawi believed, and continues to believe, that \nmore speech is the solution to disagreement, rather than less, and that empathy and understanding \nthrough communication are a way to resolve conflicts peacefully.  \n28.  By the end of 2023, student speech and protests relating to the military campaign \nin Gaza had pushed Columbia into the national spotlight. And Mr. Mahdawi became a prime target \nfor groups and individuals who wanted to suppress this flurry of activism.   \n29.  Mr. Mahdawi’s speech regarding Israel’s military campaign in Gaza, human rights, \ninternational law, obligations arising from international law, and related matters is speech protected \nby the First Amendment. Indeed, this political speech lies at the core of the First Amendment.  \n30.  Mr. Mahdawi’s family still resides in a refugee camp in the West Bank. Israeli \nauthorities have repeatedly harassed, detained, and tortured Mr. Mahdawi’s family because of his \nadvocacy for Palestinians in the United States.  \n                                                 \n1https://www.columbiaspectator.com/news/2023/11/10/hundreds-of-pro-palestinian-students-\nwalk-out-as-part-of-national-call-to-action-gather-for-peaceful-protest-art-installation  \n7 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 8 of 19\n31.  Mr. Mahdawi is fearful that, if he loses his lawful permanent resident status and he \nis removed to the West Bank, he will experience the same harassment, detention, and torture that \nhis family has experienced, and would be in even more danger in light of the campaigns that have \ntargeted and spread lies about him.   \nThe Federal Government’s Suppression of Constitutionally Protected Speech: The Palestine \nException \n \n32.  In a closed-door meeting with donors during his re-election campaign, President \nTrump explicitly stated his intent to deport students who protested the military campaign in Gaza. \nSpeaking in reference to Palestine-related protests, President Trump told donors: “Any student that \nprotests, I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as \nthey hear that, they’re going to have to behave.”2  \n33.  As a candidate, President Trump additionally pledged to “terminate the visas of all \nthose Hamas sympathizers, and we’ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities, and get \nthem the hell out of our country.”3  \n34.  In fall of 2023, then-Senator Marco Rubio repeated these sentiments, stating on \nsocial media that “people marching at universities” were “supporters of Hamas” and that the U.S. \nshould “cancel the visa of every foreign national out there supporting Hamas and get them out of \nAmerica.”4 \n35.  In January of 2025, after assuming office, President Trump signed two executive \norders intended to fulfill his campaign promises of deporting protestors, Executive Order 14161, \n“Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and other National Security and Public \n                                                 \n2 https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/05/27/trump-israel-gaza-policy-donors/. \n3https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-administration-cancel-student-visas-all-hamas-\nsympathizers-white-house-2025-01-29/ .   \n4 https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1713652113098539120.   \n8 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 9 of 19\nSafety Threats,” signed on January 20, 2025, and Executive Order 14188, titled “Additional \nMeasures to Combat Anti-Semitism,” signed on January 29, 2025.  \n36.  Executive Order 14161 states that its purpose is to “protect [United States] citizens” \nfrom aliens who “espouse hateful ideology” and “bear hostile attitudes towards [United States] \ncitizens, culture, government, institutions, or founding principles.” The order does not define \n“hostile attitudes,” leaving the term open to encompass any form of political dissent or criticism \nof government policies.  \n37.  Executive Order 14188 and its accompanying fact sheet states the government’s \nintent to target post-October 7, 2023 campus antisemitism, particularly on “leftist, anti-American \ncolleges and universities.” The order’s definition of antisemitism encompasses constitutionally \nprotected criticism of the Israeli government and its policies. The fact sheet frames the order as a \npromise to “deport Hamas sympathizers and revoke student visas,” in order to send a message to \nall “resident aliens who participated in pro-jihadist protests” that the federal government “will find \nyou…and deport you.”  \n38.  Following  the  passage  of  these  executive  orders,  prominent  groups  opposing \nPalestinian rights began publicly sharing the names of outspoken individuals whom they believed \nwere non-citizens and wanted the government to deport. These groups explicitly singled out these \nindividuals for their Palestine advocacy. Upon information and belief, these groups submitted these \nnames to ICE’s tip line.  \n39.  Betar USA—a group revived in 2024 which describes itself as “loud, proud, \naggressive, and unapologetically Zionist”5—has publicly stated that it had “already submitted \n                                                 \n5 https://betarus.org/  \n9 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 10 of 19\nnames of hundreds of terror supporters to the Trump administration.”6 On its website, Betar \nadvocates  for  “military  preparedness”  in  supporting  Israel  and  “demands  that  its  members \nunderstand force and weapons.”7 \n40.  Betar USA’s first target was lawful permanent resident Mahmoud Khalil. On \nJanuary 29, 2025, the organization posted on social media that ICE is “aware of his home address \nand whereabouts” and confirmed that they “have provided his information to multiple contacts.”8  \n41.  The following day, on January 30, 2025, Betar posted on X that “visa holder \nMohsen Mahdawi is on our deport list.”9  \n42.  On March 8, Mahmoud Khalil was returning from a Ramadan dinner when he was \ndetained by DHS agents. Although the agents initially stated that they were revoking Mr. Khalil’s \n“visa,” upon learning that Mr. Khalil was a green-card holder, they stated that they would be \nrevoking that too.10  \n43.  Following Mr. Khalil’s arrest, President Trump issued a statement on Truth Social \ntouting Mr. Khalil’s arrest as a blueprint for future government actions. President Trump warned \nthat Mr. Khalil’s arrest was “the first of many to come,” and stated that his administration would \nnot tolerate “students at Columbia and other universities across the country who have engaged in \n                                                 \n6 Nicholas Liu, A pro-Israel group says it gave the Trump administration a list of students to deport, \nSalon.com (Jan. 31, 2025), available at https://www.salon.com/2025/01/31/pledged-to-deport-\npro-palestine--and-a-pro-israel-group-has-already-made-a-list/.   \n7 https://betarus.org/about/oath/. \n8 https://x.com/Betar_USA/status/1884796686020550930 \n9 https://x.com/Betar_USA/status/1885077865684754439 \n10 Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Case 1:25-cv-01935, Dkt. 38 at 2-3 (March 13, \n2025). \n10 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 11 of 19\npro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity.” 11 The President promised to “find, apprehend, \nand deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country.”12  \n44.  On social media site X, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote that the Trump \nadministration “will be revoking the visas and/or green cards of Hamas supporters in America so \nthey can be deported.” 13 \n45.  Following these statements, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed that \nMr. Khalil’s arrest by ICE was carried out “in support of President Trump’s executive order’s \nprohibiting anti-semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State.”14 \n46.  The federal government based its detention of Mr. Khalil on the Secretary of State’s \nclaim that he posed a “threat to the foreign policy and national security interests of the United \nStates.”15 In his Notice to Appear (“NTA”), the government cited Section 237(a)(3)(C)(i) of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act, stating that “the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to \nbelieve that [Mr. Khalil’s] presence or activities in the United States would have potentially serious \nadverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.” 16 \n47.  In a statement to the Free Press on March 10, a White House Official stated that the \nfederal government would use its basis for targeting Mr. Khalil as a “blueprint” for investigations \nagainst other students.17 \n                                                 \n11 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114139222625284782 \n12 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114139222625284782 \n13 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114139222625284782 \n14 https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1898908955675357314 \n15 https://www.thefp.com/p/the-ice-detention-of-a-columbia-student \n16 Amended Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, Case 1:25-cv-01935, Dkt. 38 at 2-3 (March 13, \n2025). \n17 https://www.thefp.com/p/the-ice-detention-of-a-columbia-student \n11 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 12 of 19\n48.  In a press conference on March 12, 2025, Secretary of State Rubio stated, “if you \ntell us that you are in favor of a group like this [Hamas], and if you tell us . . . I intend to come to \nyour country as a student, and rile up all kind of anti-Jewish, anti-semitic activities, and “if you \nend up having a green card . . . we’re going to kick you out.”18  \n49.  Following the arrest of Mr. Khalil, Betar revived its public calls for the deportation \nof Mr. Mahdawi. On March 14, 2025, Betar posted on social media platform X that “Mohsen \nMahdawi is next and also on the deport list.”19 A week later, on March 20, 2025, Betar again \nposted, “Mohsen Mahdawi is next and also on the deport list.”20 \nMohsen’s Detention by DHS as Implementation of the Policy to Arrest Protestors  \n50.  On April 14, 2025, Mr. Mahdawi was attending a naturalization interview at 463 \nMountain View Drive, Colchester, VT  05446 when he was arrested and detained by DHS officers.  \n51.  Public statements up by government officials, including statements by the President \nand Secretary of State, establish that Respondents have detained Mr. Mahdawi to punish and \nsilence him because of his constitutionally protected speech, beliefs, statements, or associations.  \n52.  Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the Secretary of State is prohibited \nfrom excluding or conditioning entry to noncitizens based on “past, current, or expected beliefs, \nstatements, or associations, if such beliefs, statements, or associations would be lawful within the \nUnited States,” unless the Secretary personally certifies to Congress that admitting the individual \nwould compromise a compelling U.S. foreign policy interest. Section 212(a)(3)(C)(iii) of the INA, \n8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(C)(iii).  \n                                                 \n18 http://state.gov/secretary-of-state-marco-rubio-remarks-to-press/   \n19 https://x.com/Betar_USA/status/1900611049637724488 \n20 https://x.com/Betar_USA/status/1900611049637724488 \n12 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 13 of 19\n53.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Secretary  Rubio  has  not  provided  any  such \ncertifications to the chairs of the House Foreign Affairs, Senate Foreign Relations, and House and \nSenate Judiciary Committees, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(C)(iv).  \n54.  Notwithstanding  such  a  determination,  legislative  history  demonstrates  that \nCongress  intended  to  prevent  the  Executive  from  excluding  noncitizens  based  on  their \nconstitutionally protected speech and beliefs. The Moynihan Amendment, passed in 1987, was \nintended “to take away the executive branch’s authority to deny visas to foreigners solely because \nof the foreigner’s political beliefs or because of his anticipated speech in the United States” and to \naffirm “the principles of the First Amendment.” (S. Rep. No. 100–75 at 11, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. \n(1987), reprinted in 133 Cong. Rec. S2326 (1987)).  \n55.  Congress also asserted that such exclusions should not be based solely on “the \npossible content of an alien’s speech in this country,” that the Secretary should issue such \ndeterminations “sparingly and not merely because there is a likelihood that an alien will make \ncritical remarks about the United States or its policies,” and that the “compelling foreign policy \ninterest” standard should be applied strictly. (H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-955, 101st Cong., 2nd Sess. \n(1990), reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6784, 6794).  The legislative history provided, as an example, \nthe entry of the Shah of Iran into the United States, which could imminently have resulted in harm to \nU.S. persons or property abroad. Id. at 6793. \n56.  Such determinations have been rarely issued since the enactment of the provision. \nWhere the Secretary of State has invoked the foreign policy ground, it has concerned a high-\nranking government official or individual facing high-profile prosecutions in his country of origin.  \n57.  At least until these recent arrests, on information and belief, section 237(a)(4)(C) \nof the INA has never been invoked based purely on lawful beliefs, statements, or associations, that \nhave taken place within the United States. This may be because it is a grammatically awkward at \n13 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 14 of 19\nbest to apply the provisions of INA § 212(a)(3)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3)(C), incorporated by \nreference into INA § 237(a)(4)(C), 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C), to beliefs, statements, or associations \nwhich are or were lawful in the United States, and to say of such activities, in what appears to be \ncounterfactual  language,  that  they  “would  be  lawful  within  the  United  States,”  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(3)(C)(iii).  Moreover, given the choice between an interpretation of the statute that \nwould remove such lawful beliefs, statements, and activities that take place within the United \nStates from the protection of the exemption at 8 U.S.C. §1182(a)(3)(C)(iii), and an interpretation \nthat would prevent such lawful beliefs, statements, or activities that take place within the United \nStates from being used a basis for a finding of inadmissibility or deportability under 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(3)(C) and 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C), the doctrine of constitutional doubt counsels in \nfavor of the latter interpretation. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \n \nFIRST CLAIM \nViolation of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution \n58.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in the \npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n59.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “Congress \nshall make no law  . . . abridging the freedom of speech . . . or the right of the people . . . to petition \nthe Government for a redress of grievances.” U.S. Const. Amend. I.  \n60.  The First Amendment protects speech by noncitizens resident in the United States.  \n61.  The First Amendment also protects past, present, and future speech.  \n62.  The government’s Policy of detaining noncitizens on the basis of their protected \nspeech, and the targeting, arrest, and detention of Mr. Mahdawi, violate the First Amendment.  \n14 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 15 of 19\n63.  The government targeted Mr. Mahdawi on the basis of his past protected speech.  \n64.  The government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi prevents him from \ncontinuing to exercise his constitutional right to speech.  \n65.  The government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi chills both his speech \nand the speech of other individuals who would like to express similar views.  \n66.  The government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi may prevent his future \nspeech in the United States in the event that he is indeed removed from the country.  \n67.  The government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi deprives audiences of \nhis present and future speech on matters of public concern. \n68.  These consequences are not incidental to some legitimate government objective. \nAs  the  government  has  made  clear,  these  consequences  (chilling  and  preventing  speech \nsympathetic to Palestine) is the ultimate objective of the government’s actions.  \nSECOND CLAIM \nViolation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution \n69.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if \nfully set forth herein.  \n70.  The Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution applies to “all persons \nwithin the United States, including aliens, whether their presence is lawful, unlawful, temporary, \nor permanent.” Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 679 (2001). \n71.  Immigration detention must further the twin goals of ensuring a noncitizen’s \nappearance during removal proceedings and preventing danger to the community.  \n72.  In light of these goals, Mr. Mahdawi’s detention is wholly unjustified. Indeed, it \nbears no reasonable relation to any legitimate government purpose.  \n15 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 16 of 19\n73.  Mr. Mahdawi is not a flight risk. He plans to begin a master’s program at Columbia \nin the coming fall. He has lived in the United States for the past eleven years, and his life, \ncommunity, and work all are in the United States. \n74.  Mr. Mahdawi is not a danger to the community. He has no criminal record, and \nthere is no other legitimate reason to regard him as a danger to the community.  \n75.  Because Mr. Mahdawi’s detention bears no reasonable relation to a legitimate \ngovernment purpose, it is punitive.  \n76.  The sole basis for Mr. Mahdawi’s detention is to punish him for his speech and to \nchill similar speech.  \n77.  Additionally,  the  Policy  and  Rubio  Determination  against  Mr.  Mahdawi  are \nunconstitutionally vague. \nTHIRD CLAIM \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Accardi Doctrine \n \n78.   Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if \nfully set forth herein.  \n79.  The government has adopted a Policy of targeting noncitizens for removal on the \nbasis of First Amendment protected speech which advocates for Palestinian rights.  \n80.  This policy is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, contrary to constitutional \nright, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory jurisdiction, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A), (B), (C), and \nviolates the Accardi doctrine and federal agencies’ own rules, see Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 \nU.S. 260 (1954).  \n81.  Additionally, the Secretary of State’s determination is arbitrary and capricious, an \nabuse of discretion, contrary to constitutional right, contrary to law, and in excess of statutory \njurisdiction. 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(A), (B), (C). \n16 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 17 of 19\nFOURTH CLAIM \nViolation of the Non-Delegation Doctrine \n82.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if \nfully set forth herein. \n83.  Congress has not provided the Executive Branch with intelligible principles from \nwhich the Executive Branch can implement 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(3)(C)(4)(i)-(ii) or 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1182(a)(3)(C)(i)  and  (iii),  except  and  to  the  extent  that  those  statutes  are  interpreted  to \ncategorically exclude from consideration beliefs, statements, and associations that occur within the \nUnited States and that are lawful within the United States.  \n84.  Congress has delegated discretionary authority that is, at least if the statute is \ninterpreted as the government apparently proposes to interpret it, standardless and unreviewable. \n85.  Congress has failed to provide standards or procedures to allow for judicial review \nof an agency’s discretionary deprivation of a noncitizen’s liberty.  \nFIFTH CLAIM \nRelease on Bail Pending Adjudication \n86.  Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if \nfully set forth herein.  \n87.  This Court has the “inherent authority” to grant bail to habeas petitioners like Mr. \nMahdawi. See Mapp v. Reno, 241 F.3d 221, 230 (2d Cir. 2001). \n88.  When considering such a petition, courts assess (1) “whether the petition raises \nsubstantial claims” and (2) “whether extraordinary circumstances exist that make the grant of bail \nnecessary to make the remedy effective.” Elkimya v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 484 F.3d 151, 154 \n(2d Cir. 2007) (cleaned up).  \n17 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 18 of 19\n89.  As long as Mr. Mahdawi is in detention, he will be unable to speak freely, ratifying \nthe ultimate constitutional violation that the government sought to achieve with his detention.  \n90.  As long as Mr. Mahdawi is in detention, he will be punished for his disfavored \nspeech, ratifying another constitutional violation that the government sought to achieve with his \ndetention \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court:  \n1)  Assume jurisdiction over this matter;  \n2)  Vacate and set aside Respondents’ unlawful Policy of targeting noncitizens for \nremoval based on First Amendment protected speech advocating for Palestinian \nrights;  \n3)  Vacate and set aside the Rubio Determination;  \n4)  Enjoin Respondents from transferring the Petitioner from the jurisdiction of this \nDistrict pending these proceedings;  \n5)  Order the immediate release of Petitioner pending these proceedings;  \n6)  Order the release of Petitioner;  \n7)  Declare that Respondents’ actions to arrest and detain Petitioner violate the First \nAmendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as well as the \nAdministrative Procedure Act and the non-delegation doctrine;  \n8)  Award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs for this action; and  \n9)  Grant such further relief as the Court deems just and proper.  \n   \nDated: April 14, 2025   \n   \n  Barre, Vermont \n  /s/ Andrew Delaney________________ \nAndrew Delaney \nandrew@mdrvt.com \nMDR Law Group \n100 North Main Street \nBarre, Vermont 05641 \nP: 802-479-0568 \n \n   \n              Luna Droubi* \nBeldock Levine & Hoffman, LLP \n99 Park Avenue, PH/26th Floor \nNew York, New York 10016 \nP: (212) 277-5820 \n18 \n\n2:25-cv-00389     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 19 of 19\nF: (212) 277-5880 \n \nCyrus D.

PARKER, SUSAN L. CARNEY, and ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judges: \nMohsen Mahdawi is an undergraduate student at Columbia University.  He \nis also a Lawful Permanent Resident who has lived in the United States for over a \ndecade and is in the process of applying to become a U.S. citizen.  When Mahdawi \nappeared  for  his  naturalization  interview  in  Vermont  on  April  14,  2025,  he \nanswered the government’s questions and passed his citizenship test.  But, he \nalleges, at the interview’s conclusion, a team of armed law enforcement officers \nentered  the  room  and  placed  him  under  arrest.    He  was  brought  to  a  U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services office and was served with a Notice to \nAppear, which informed him that the U.S. Secretary of State had determined that \nhe was removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality \nAct.  Officers then brought him to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, with the \nintent to transport him to Louisiana, but after they missed the flight to Louisiana, \nofficers brought him to a detention center in Vermont.   \nThrough counsel, Mahdawi filed a habeas petition, challenging his arrest \nand detention and seeking his release.  He maintains that, in violation of his First \nand Fifth Amendment rights, he was arrested and detained in retaliation for his \npeaceful advocacy on the politically contentious topic of the war in Gaza.  On \nMahdawi’s emergency motion, the district court issued, and later extended, a \n1 \n \n\n(4 of 27), Page 4 of 27\ntemporary restraining order prohibiting the government from removing Mahdawi \nfrom the District of Vermont.  Following a bail hearing, the court also granted \nMahdawi’s motion to be released during the pendency of his habeas proceeding, \nfinding that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community—findings \nthat the government does not contest before this panel.   \nThe government now seeks an emergency stay of these orders.  Largely for \nthe reasons explained in our opinion in Öztürk v. Hyde, No. 25-1019, 2025 WL \n1318154 (2d Cir. May 7, 2025), we deny the motion for a stay.  As explained there, \nthe government is unlikely to succeed on its arguments that the district court \nlacked jurisdiction over Mahdawi’s habeas petition.  We further conclude that the \ngovernment is unlikely to succeed on its arguments that the district court lacked \nthe  authority  to  order  Mahdawi’s  release.    We  are  also  unpersuaded  by  the \ngovernment’s  argument  that  the  district  court’s  orders  prevented  it  from \neffectuating duly enacted law, thereby causing it to suffer irreparable injury.  In \nfact,  immigration  removal  proceedings  have  continued  in  Louisiana,  and \nMahdawi has attended them remotely since his release.  Finally, the balance of the \nequities tips in favor of denying the stay.  Indeed, the practical effect of the relief \nthe  government  seeks  would  be  Mahdawi’s  re-detention.    Individual  liberty \n2 \n \n\n(5 of 27), Page 5 of 27\nsubstantially outweighs the government’s weak assertions of administrative and \nlogistical costs.  For these reasons, the government’s motion for a stay is DENIED \nand the government’s request for a writ of mandamus is also DENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis  case  arises  from  the  arrest  and  detention  of  Mohsen  Mahdawi,  a \nPalestinian student who entered the United States in July 2014 and has been a \nLawful Permanent Resident since January 2015.  Mahdawi is an undergraduate at \nColumbia University, majoring in philosophy.  As a student at Columbia, he spoke \nout against Israel’s military response to the atrocities committed by Hamas on \nOctober 7, 2023.  He also took part in student demonstrations where he spoke \npublicly about “the importance of respecting international law, human rights, and \nthe need for a permanent ceasefire and a peaceful resolution.”  Mahdawi v. Trump, \nNo. 2:25-cv-389, 2025 WL 1243135, at *1 (D. Vt. Apr. 30, 2025) (quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 19-2 ¶ 15).  The government does not at \nthis time assert that his speech was not protected by the First Amendment. \nOn April 14, 2025, Mahdawi appeared for his naturalization interview in \nVermont.    Mot.  Ex.  A  (Habeas  Petition,  hereinafter  “Pet.”)  at  12  ¶ 50.  \nUnbeknownst to Mahdawi, a month earlier the Secretary of State had secretly \nissued a memorandum, ostensibly pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C), declaring \n3 \n \n\n(6 of 27), Page 6 of 27\nhim  deportable  for  his  speech  and  associations,  which  the  memorandum \ndescribed as “otherwise lawful.”  Mot. Ex. B at 1.  At the end of his interview, he \nwas arrested by a team of masked ICE agents, brought to a U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service office, and served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”).  The \nNTA stated that Mahdawi was removable because “[t]he Secretary of State has \ndetermined that your presence and activities in the United States would have \nserious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling \nU.S. foreign policy interest.”  Mahdawi, 2025 WL 1243135, at *3 (quoting Dist. Ct. \nDkt. ECF No. 19-2, at 10, 13). \nThat same day, shortly before 2:00 p.m., the agents transported Mahdawi to \nthe airport in Burlington, Vermont, intending to transport him to a Louisiana jail.  \nThey missed their scheduled flight, and Mahdawi was moved first to the ICE field \noffice in St. Albans, Vermont, and then to the Northwest State Correctional Facility \nin Swanton, Vermont.   \nMahdawi’s attorney filed a habeas petition in the District of Vermont, which \nwas first assigned to Judge William K. Sessions III.  Among other things, his \npetition challenges “the government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi,” \n4 \n \n\n(7 of 27), Page 7 of 27\nand alleges that his “unlawful arrest and detention” was intended “to punish him \nfor his speech and to chill similar speech.”  Pet. at 2 ¶ 4, 15 ¶¶ 64–67, 16 ¶ 76.   \nShortly after his arrest on April 14, Judge Sessions granted Mahdawi’s \nemergency  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  (“TRO”)  prohibiting \nMahdawi’s transfer to Louisiana or his removal from this country.  Mahdawi, No. \n2:25-cv-389, 2025 WL 1099021, at *1 (D. Vt. Apr. 14, 2025).  On April 24, following \nthe case’s reassignment to Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford, the court extended the \nTRO.  Mahdawi, No. 25-cv-389 (D. Vt. Apr. 24, 2025), Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 34.  \nDuring this time, Mahdawi remained detained at Northwest Correctional Facility.   \nMahdawi  applied  for  release  on  bail  pending  resolution  of  his  habeas \npetition.    On  April  30,  2025,  after  a  hearing,  Judge  Crawford  granted  the \napplication.  In a careful and well-reasoned opinion, the court concluded, among \nother things, that Mahdawi presented neither a flight risk nor a danger to his \ncommunity or to others.  Mahdawi, 2025 WL 1243135, at *12.  The government has \nyet to contest these findings. \nBefore us is the government’s emergency motion seeking a stay pending \nappeal of the district court’s order extending its initial TRO (April 24, 2025 Order) \nand its order of release on bail (April 30, 2025 Order).  The government asked for \n5 \n \n\n(8 of 27), Page 8 of 27\nthis stay motion to be heard on an expedited schedule, and together with its stay \nmotion in Öztürk.  An applications judge granted these requests and denied the \nrequest for an administrative stay.  See 2d Cir. Dkt. ECF No. 30.1   \nII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION \nAs  an  initial  matter,  and  as  Mahdawi  concedes,  we  have  appellate \njurisdiction to review each of the challenged orders.  First, under the “collateral \norder doctrine,” we have jurisdiction to review “‘a small class of’ interlocutory \nrulings that ‘are too important to be denied review and too independent of the \ncause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case \nis adjudicated.’”  Fischer v. New York State Dep’t of L., 812 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349 (2006)) (other internal citations omitted).  \nWe have previously held that an order granting bail pending disposition of a \nhabeas petition is an appealable collateral order.  Iuteri v. Nardoza, 662 F.2d 159, \n161 (2d Cir. 1981).   \nSecond, because the TRO lasts for up to 90 days and “carries many of the \nhallmarks  of  a  preliminary  injunction,”  we  construe  it  “as  an  appealable \npreliminary injunction.”  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025); see \n \n1  The government also moved to consolidate the two cases.  We deny that \nmotion by separate order.   \n6 \n \n\n(9 of 27), Page 9 of 27\nalso Trump v. J. G. G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1005, 1006 (2025) (vacating a TRO that had \nenjoined the government from removing any of the individual plaintiffs from the \nUnited States for 14 days).  Accordingly, we conclude that both the district court’s \nrelease order and extended TRO are appealable orders.   \nIII.  STAY PENDING APPEAL \nA stay is “an exercise of judicial discretion,” and the “propriety of its issue \nis dependent upon the circumstances” presented to the court.  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 433 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).  “The party requesting a stay bears \nthe burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of [the Court’s] \ndiscretion.”  Id. at 433–34.  The four stay factors are “(1) whether the stay applicant \nhas made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether \nthe applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the \nstay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and \n(4) where the public interest lies.”  Id. at 434 (quotation marks omitted).  “The first \ntwo factors . . . are the most critical.”  Id.  And where “the government is a party \nto the suit, the final two factors merge.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n969 F.3d 42, 58–59 (2d Cir. 2020).  We deny the stay because the government has \nnot met its burden on any of these factors. \n7 \n \n\n(10 of 27), Page 10 of 27\nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe government contends that several provisions of the Immigration and \nNational Act (“INA”) stripped the district court of jurisdiction in this case, and \nthat the district court accordingly lacked the power to order Mahdawi’s release \nand to extend the TRO.  These arguments are unlikely to succeed in no small part \nbecause  our  analysis  is  guided  by  longstanding  principles  of  statutory \ninterpretation requiring Congress to speak clearly and specifically when it wishes \nto deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction.  Repeatedly, including in the INA \ncontext, the Supreme Court has declared that we should “take account . . . of the \npresumption  favoring  interpretations  of  statutes  [to]  allow  judicial \nreview . . . absent clear statement.”  Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 237 (2010) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., \n498 U.S. 479, 483–84 (1991).  “[O]nly upon a showing of clear and convincing \nevidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial \nreview.”  Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 671 (1986) \n(quotation marks omitted).  As explained below, the provisions on which the \n8 \n \n\n(11 of 27), Page 11 of 27\ngovernment relies do not state, let alone clearly state, a jurisdictional bar on review \nof Mahdawi’s detention claims. \n1.  Release Order \nAt this stage, the government makes no challenge to the district court’s \nsubstantive determination that Mahdawi should be released on bail pending the \ndisposition  of  his  habeas  petition.    See  Mahdawi,  2025  WL  1243135,  at  *8–13.  \nInstead, it makes only jurisdictional challenges to the release order based on 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(b)(9).  We conclude that these jurisdictional \nchallenges are unlikely to succeed. \na.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \nWe begin with the government’s argument that the district court’s release \norder should be stayed on the ground that § 1252(g) strips the district court of \njurisdiction to hear Mahdawi’s habeas petition.  Section 1252(g) prohibits courts \nfrom “hear[ing] any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the \ndecision or action by the Attorney General [or Secretary of Homeland Security] to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any \nalien  under this  chapter.”   8  U.S.C. §  1252(g).2    The  government  claims  that \n \n2  As  part  of  transferring  many  immigration-related  responsibilities  from  the \nAttorney General to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, “the \n \n9 \n \n\n(12 of 27), Page 12 of 27\nMahdawi’s  challenge  to  his  unlawful  detention  “aris[es]  from”  the \ncommencement of removal proceedings.  Mot. at 7 (quotation marks omitted). \nThe government dramatically overstates the reach of § 1252(g) and has \nfailed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on this claim.  As we said in Öztürk \nv. Hyde, § 1252(g) does not reach “claims that are  independent of, or wholly \ncollateral to, the removal process.”  No. 25-1019, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9 (2d Cir. \nMay 7, 2025) (quoting Kong v. United States, 62 F.4th 608, 614 (1st Cir. 2023)).  The \nSupreme Court and our Court have explained that § 1252(g)’s bar on jurisdiction \nis  “narrow[],”  and  “applies  only  to  three  discrete  actions”:  a  decision  “to \n‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Reno v. \nAm.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) (quoting 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(g) (emphases adopted)); see also Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *8.  \nSection 1252(g) is thus “directed against a particular evil: attempts to impose \njudicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9.  But \nthere are “many other decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation \nprocess” and yet do not fall within the three discrete exercises of “prosecutorial \n \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 mandates that references to the Attorney General \nare deemed to include DHS where, as here, the relevant agency functions have \nbeen transferred from the Department of Justice to DHS.”  Shabaj v. Holder, 718 \nF.3d 48, 51 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing 6 U.S.C. § 557); see also 6 U.S.C. § 202. \n10 \n \n\n(13 of 27), Page 13 of 27\ndiscretion” covered by § 1252(g).  Id. at 482, 485 n.9; see also Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *8. \nFor  that  reason,  in  Öztürk,  we  concluded  that  a  petitioner’s  “claims  of \nunlawful and retaliatory detention” were “independent of, and collateral to, the \nremoval process.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9.  There, we explained that relief \nfrom the allegedly improper detention did not interfere with DHS’s “prosecutorial \ndiscretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9.  Nor did it interfere with DHS’s ability to \ninitiate removal proceedings against the petitioner, to adjudicate her removal case, \nor to execute any removal order.  See Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9–10.  We \ntherefore held that her unlawful detention claims were collateral to the removal \nprocess and fell outside of § 1252(g)’s narrow jurisdictional bar.  Id. at *9. \nThe same is true here.  Mahdawi’s habeas petition challenges his detention \non the grounds that it violates his rights under the Constitution.3  As in Öztürk, \n \n3 Among other things, the petition's Prayer for Relief requests that the court “Order \nthe immediate release of Petitioner pending these proceedings,” “Order the release \nof  Petitioner,”  and  “Declare  that  Respondents’  actions  to  arrest  and  detain \nPetitioner violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.”  Pet. at 18.  At this time, the Court need not decide whether every \nsingle Prayer for Relief survives § 1252(g).  The district court is still considering \nthe  government’s  motion  to  dismiss  Mahdawi’s  petition  and  will  have  the \nopportunity to assess which claims are barred by § 1252(g) in the first instance.  So \nlong as part of his challenge to his detention falls outside of § 1252(g), his petition \nsurvives, as does the district court’s authority to order his release. \n11 \n \n\n(14 of 27), Page 14 of 27\nMahdawi’s “detention does not arise from the government’s ‘commenc[ement] of \nproceedings,’” which begins with the filing of an NTA in an immigration court.  \n2025 WL 1318154, at *9 (quoting AADC, 525 U.S. at 482); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a); \n8 C.F.R. § 1239.1.  Nor do his claims “arise from the decision to adjudicate [his] \nremoval case,” since it does not “implicate the Executive’s discretion” to continue \nor withdraw such a proceeding.  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *10 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Moreover, the government does not claim that Mahdawi’s detention \nwas “mandated by the mere fact” that it commenced removal proceedings against \nhim.  Id.  To the contrary, the government “confirmed that ICE’s decision to arrest \nand detain [Mahdawi] was not directed by § 1226(a).”  Id.; see also Mot. at 20 (citing \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) as its “statutory basis for [Mahdawi’s] detention”).  And since \nno removal order has been entered, Mahdawi’s detention-related claims could not \n“possibly ‘arise from’ the execution of a removal order.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, \nat *10.  Mahdawi’s unlawful detention claims are thus likely “independent of, and \ncollateral to, the removal process.”  Id. at *9.   \nThe government nevertheless insists that the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAADC bars this claim.  It is unlikely to succeed on this argument, too.  It is true \nthat the petitioners in AADC claimed that the “INS was selectively enforcing \n12 \n \n\n(15 of 27), Page 15 of 27\nimmigration laws against them in violation of their First and Fifth Amendment \nrights.”  525 U.S. at 474.  And the Supreme Court indeed concluded that the \n“challenge to the Attorney General’s decision to ‘commence proceedings’ against \nthem [fell] squarely within § 1252(g).”  Id. at 487.  But the petitioners’ claims in that \ncase  fell  within  that  jurisdictional  bar  because  they  sought  “to  prevent  the \ninitiation of deportation proceedings,” id. at 474—i.e., the “commence[ment of] \nproceedings,” id. at 482.  The habeas claims in that case did not sound in unlawful \ndetention at all, and AADC is therefore of no help to the government. \nAccordingly,  the  government  has  failed  to  satisfy  its  burden  of \ndemonstrating that § 1252(g) likely strips the district court of jurisdiction to hear \nMahdawi’s petition.  \nb.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9)  \nFor similar reasons, the government’s argument that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) \nand (b)(9) bar district court review of Mahdawi’s claims is unlikely to succeed.  \nSection 1252(b)(9) bars district court review of claims “arising from . . . action[s]” \nor  “proceeding[s]  brought  to  remove  an  alien.”    8  U.S.C.  § 1252(b)(9).    The \ngovernment urges the conclusion that Mahdawi’s arrest and detention are a but-\nfor result of the Secretary of State’s determination that he was removable, and thus \n§ 1252(b)(9) strips district courts of jurisdiction.  Mot. at 15.  In other words, the \n13 \n \n\n(16 of 27), Page 16 of 27\ngovernment  contends  that  its  detention  of  Mahdawi  works  to  funnel  all  his \nunlawful detention claims into § 1252(b)(9), irrespective of how attenuated the \nclaims may be to removal proceedings.   \nAs we explained in Öztürk, we do not read § 1252(b) so broadly.  Öztürk, \n2025  WL  1318154,  at  *10–13.    First,  the  language  of  § 1252(b)  contradicts  the \ngovernment.  Id. at *11 (“[T]he very text of § 1252(b) sets out requirements only \nwith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).” (cleaned \nup) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b))).  No order of removal is at issue here.  Second, the \nSupreme  Court  has  rejected  the  government’s  proposed  expansive  approach, \nholding  that  “§ 1252(b)(9)  does  not  present  a  jurisdictional  bar  where  those \nbringing suit are not asking for review of an order of removal, the decision to seek \nremoval, or the process by which removability will be determined.”  Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 19 (2020) (cleaned up) \n(quoting Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 294 (2018)).   \nAs explained above, Mahdawi’s unlawful detention claims may be resolved \nwithout affecting pending removal proceedings.  He asserts that the government \narrested him to punish speech with which it disagrees.  But doing so would violate \nthe Constitution—quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the \n14 \n \n\n(17 of 27), Page 17 of 27\nimmigration courts.  Consequently, even if his claims have a substantive overlap \nwith challenges he may bring in his removal proceedings, his detention claims do \nnot themselves challenge or arise from “removal proceedings,” and “§ 1252(b)(9)’s \nchanneling  function  has  no  role  to  play.”    Öztürk,  2025  WL  1318154,  at  *11 \n(quotation marks omitted).  As we noted in Öztürk, legislative history from the \nREAL ID Act further supports this conclusion.  H.R. Rep. No. 109–72, at 175 (2005) \n(Conf. Rep.), as reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240, 300 (specifying that jurisdiction-\nstripping  provisions  “would  not  preclude  habeas  review  over  challenges  to \ndetention that are independent of challenges to removal orders”).   \nThis  distinction  between  detention  and  removal  makes  practical \nsense.  While challenges to removal can be heard in a petition for review after an \norder of removal has been entered by an immigration judge and affirmed by the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, the same is not true of constitutional challenges to \ndetention like those raised by Mahdawi.  As we explained in Öztürk, “neither the \nIJ nor the BIA has ‘jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.’”  Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *12 (quoting Rabiu v. Immigr. & Naturalization Serv., 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d \nCir. 1994)).  And while the court of appeals considering the petition for review \nmay consider constitutional claims, that court is obliged to “decide the petition \n15 \n \n\n(18 of 27), Page 18 of 27\nonly  on  the  administrative  record  on  which  the  order  of  removal  is  based.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  We are not persuaded that an IJ or the \nBIA will develop a sufficient factual record, or any record at all, with respect to the \nchallenged detention, especially given that bond hearings are decided separately, \nappealed separately, and contain records separate from those made in the removal \nproceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a); 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1(d), 1003.19(d); U.S. Dep’t \nJust., Exec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., Immigration Court Practice Manual, § 9.3(e), (f) \n(last  visited  May  6,  2025),  available  at  https://www.justice.gov/eoir/reference-\nmaterials/ic/chapter-9/3  [https://perma.cc/9A6W-AG9U].    This  means  that  in \nmany, if not most, instances, courts of appeal would not have a sufficient record \nto assess the constitutionality of the government’s conduct in cases such as this.   \nConstruing  an  independent  constitutional  challenge  to  detention  as \nnecessarily implying a challenge to removal would lead to what Jennings called an \n“absurd” result.  583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and \nKennedy, J.).  Mahdawi’s core argument is that his free speech and due process \nrights are being violated, now.  Pet. at 15–16, ¶¶ 63–76; see also Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *12.  “By the time a final order of removal [is] eventually entered”—if \nit ever is entered—the allegedly wrongful detention will have already occurred.  \n16 \n \n\n(19 of 27), Page 19 of 27\nJennings, 583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, \nJ.). \nAccordingly, the government has not established that § 1252(b)(9) likely \nstrips the district court of jurisdiction to hear Mahdawi’s petition.  For the same \nreasons, we reject the government’s argument that § 1252(a)(5) likely forecloses \nreview of Mahdawi’s petition.  Section 1252(a)(5) bars district court review “of an \norder of removal,” but no order of removal is at issue here.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).   \n2.  TRO Extension Order \nThe government also asserts that the INA deprived the district court of \njurisdiction to extend its TRO.  As a preliminary matter, the government conceded \nat argument that if the release order remains in place, its challenge to the TRO is \n“essentially moot.”  Oral Arg. Hearing at 23:40–24:09.  But in any event, the \ngovernment is unlikely to prevail.  As in Öztürk, the government relies on 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which precludes the exercise of federal court jurisdiction “to \nreview . . . any . . . decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to \nbe  in  the  discretion  of  the  Attorney  General  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Here, the government \ncontends that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprived the district court of jurisdiction to extend \n17 \n \n\n(20 of 27), Page 20 of 27\nthe TRO on the ground that the decision where to detain a noncitizen pending \nremoval proceedings is committed to the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, and the INA precludes judicial review over such discretionary decisions.  \nSee Mot. at 17–19.  \nBut as we explained in Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *7–8, the government \ndramatically overstates the scope of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s \nbar on jurisdiction applies only to those decisions where Congress has expressly \n“set out the Attorney General’s discretionary authority in the statute.”  Kucana, 558 \nU.S. at 247.  Crucially, the question is not whether § 1231(g) “require[s] an exercise \nof  discretion”  because  even  if  it  “probably  do[es],” the  crux  is  “whether  the \ntext . . . specifies that the decision is in the discretion of the Attorney General.”  \nNethagani v. Mukasey, 532 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  We have held \nthat “when a statute authorizes the Attorney General to make a determination, but \nlacks additional language specifically rendering that determination to be within \nhis discretion (e.g., ‘in the discretion of the Attorney General,’ ‘to the satisfaction \nof the Attorney General,’ etc.), the decision is not one that is ‘specified . . . to be in \n18 \n \n\n(21 of 27), Page 21 of 27\nthe discretion of the Attorney General’ for purposes of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Id. at \n154–55. \nThe government argues that two different statutory provisions, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(g) and 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), “specif[y]” that the decision to detain immigrants \nin  the  custodial  location  of  the  government’s  choice  is  within  the  executive \nbranch’s  exclusive  discretion,  precluding  judicial  review.    The  government  is \nunlikely to prevail on this argument.  Section 1231(g) has no such additional \nlanguage.    It  merely  states  that  “[t]he  Attorney  General  shall  arrange  for \nappropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision \non removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  Far from authorizing discretion, § 1231(g) uses \nthe obligatory “shall” rather than the permissive “may.”  This language is “in stark \ncontrast to other sections of the INA,” which both use permissive verbs and \ninclude additional language specifying that those decisions that are within the \nAttorney General or DHS Secretary’s discretion.  Aguilar v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs \nEnf’t Div. of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 2007); cf., e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1157(c)(1) (“[T]he Attorney General may, in the Attorney General’s discretion . . . .” \n(emphasis added)).  When “Congress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed \n19 \n \n\n(22 of 27), Page 22 of 27\nthat  Congress  acts  intentionally  and  purposely  in  the  disparate  inclusion  or \nexclusion.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 430 (quoting I.N.S. v. Cardoza–Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, \n432 (1987)).4 \nSection 1226(a), which states that “an alien may be arrested and detained \npending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States,” \nsimilarly falls outside the scope of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).  First, the \npermissive “may” in § 1226(a)  provides discretion only as to the decision to \ndetain—not as to the location of detention.  But even if this section did “authorize[] \nthe Attorney General” to detain an alien wherever they saw fit, it “lacks additional \nlanguage specifically rendering that determination to be within his discretion \n(e.g., ‘in the discretion of the Attorney General,’ ‘to the satisfaction of the Attorney \nGeneral,’ etc.).”  Nethagani, 532 F.3d at 154–55.  Accordingly, such a decision does \n \n4 In fact, the very next sentence of § 1231(g)(1) uses the permissive “may,” and the \nsubsection appears to relate “more centrally to the government’s brick and mortar \nobligations for obtaining facilities in which to detain aliens.”  Reyna as next friend \nof J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d 204, 209 (4th Cir. 2019).  Section 1231(g) first provides that \nthe Attorney General “shall arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens \ndetained pending removal or a decision on removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  If such \nfacilities “are unavailable,” the statute then provides that “the Attorney General \nmay expend” from specified appropriations “amounts necessary to acquire land \nand to acquire, build, remodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living \nquarters  for  immigration  officers  if  not  otherwise  available)  necessary  for \ndetention.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n20 \n \n\n(23 of 27), Page 23 of 27\nnot preclude judicial review because it “is not one that is ‘specified . . . to be in the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General’ for purposes of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Id. at 155. \nThe Supreme Court has applied the “presumption favoring interpretations \nof  statutes  [to]  allow  judicial  review . . . absent  clear  statement”  to \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s bar on jurisdiction.  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 237 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Under these circumstances, we do not believe that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), by \noperation of § 1231(g) and § 1226(a), likely forecloses judicial review. \nAccordingly, we conclude that the government is unlikely to succeed in its \nappeal of the order releasing Mahdawi and the order extending the TRO. \nB.  Irreparable Injury \nAs in Öztürk, the government contends that any court order related to \nimmigration detention matters causes irreparable injury to its sovereign authority.  \nBut the government has not demonstrated in what way it is being “enjoined by a \ncourt [from] effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people.”  Mot. \nat  19  (quoting  Maryland  v.  King,  567  U.S.  1301,  1303  (2012)  (Roberts,  C.J.,  in \nchambers)).  The district court’s order to hold Mahdawi (if detained) in Vermont \npending  his  habeas  petition  hearing  does  not  enjoin  the  government  from \nenforcing or “effectuating” any duly enacted law.  The district court concluded \nthat Mahdawi is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, and the \n21 \n \n\n(24 of 27), Page 24 of 27\ngovernment does not challenge that determination.  Further, Mahdawi’s challenge \nto his detention does not seek to disrupt—and nothing prevents the government \nfrom continuing with—the removal proceedings it has commenced.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii)–(iv)  (providing  that  removal  proceedings  may  take  place \nthrough  video  conference  or,  in  some  circumstances,  “through  telephone \nconference”).    We  thus  conclude  that  the  government  has  not  shown  any \nirreparable injury from either his release on bail or continued presence in the \nDistrict of Vermont pending his removal proceedings.   \nC.  Balance of Equities \n  Finally, the balance of the equities weighs heavily against a stay.  First of all, \nthe practical effect of the relief the government seeks would be to allow Mahdawi’s \nre-detention.  And “[t]he interest of the habeas petitioner in release pending appeal \n[is] always substantial.”  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 777 (1987).  This is \nespecially true given Mahdawi’s substantial First Amendment claims.  See Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (“The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”).  And as \nto the TRO, inherent in the term “habeas corpus” is the notion that the government \nis required to produce the detainee in order to allow the court to examine the \nlegality of detention.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2243 (“[T]he person to whom the writ is \n22 \n \n\n(25 of 27), Page 25 of 27\ndirected  shall  be  required  to  produce  at  the  hearing  the  body  of  the  person \ndetained.”); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 778 (1950) (“A basic consideration \nin habeas corpus practice is that the prisoner will be produced before the court.  \nThis is the crux of the statutory scheme established by the Congress; indeed, it is \ninherent in the very term ‘habeas corpus.’”).  \n  For its part, the government does not contest the district court’s findings \nthat Mahdawi is neither a danger to the public nor a flight risk.  Instead, it claims \nirreparable harm from the “practical cost[]” of “creat[ing] an ad-hoc location for \nMahdawi  to  continue  to  appear  for  his  removal  proceedings  in  Louisiana \nremotely.”  Mot. at 19–20.  We are unpersuaded.  For one, Mahdawi is not in ICE \ndetention, so his appearing remotely is his responsibility, not the government’s.  \nBut  even  if  he  were  re-detained,  “[f]aced  with  such  a  conflict  between  the \ngovernment’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, \nand the risk of substantial constitutional harm to [Mahdawi] on the other, we have \nlittle difficulty concluding ‘that the balance of hardships tips decidedly’ in [his] \nfavor.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *14 (quoting Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, \n808 (2d Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \n23 \n \n\n(26 of 27), Page 26 of 27\nIV.  MANDAMUS RELIEF  \nThe  government  asks  this  Court,  in  the  alternative,  to  issue  a  writ  of \nmandamus and hold that the district court lacked authority to order Mahdawi’s \nrelease and extend the TRO.  “The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be \ninvoked only in extraordinary situations.”  Kerr v. U. S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of \nCalifornia,  426  U.S.  394,  402  (1976).    “We  issue  the  writ  only  in  exceptional \ncircumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of \ndiscretion.”  In re Roman Cath. Diocese of Albany, New York, Inc., 745 F.3d 30, 35 (2d \nCir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted); see also Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 \nU.S.  367,  380  (2004).    The  government  has  shown  no  such  exceptional \ncircumstances.  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *14 (denying writ of mandamus \nbecause “the government’s argument . . . that the district court lacked jurisdiction \n. . . runs the government head into the ‘general rule that appellate courts should \navoid determining jurisdictional issues on a petition for mandamus’” (quoting In \nre Ivy, 901 F.2d 7, 10 (2d Cir. 1990))).  We therefore decline to issue a writ of \nmandamus. \n*  *  * \n24 \n \n\n(27 of 27), Page 27 of 27\nFor the reasons stated above, the government’s motion for a stay of the \ndistrict court’s release order and extended TRO is DENIED.  The government’s \nrequest for a writ of mandamus is also DENIED. \nThe parties are directed to confer with the Clerk of Court to set a briefing \nschedule for the merits of the appeal. \n25 \n ",

Hyde and Mahdawi v. Trump, at bottom, is \nwhether an alien can circumvent the INA’s jurisdictional bars on federal district \ncourts reviewing removal decisions, by bringing the exact same claims against the \ndecision to detain the alien as part of removal.1  The answer is no. \nCongress divested district courts of jurisdiction over challenges related to \nremoval, regardless of how they are styled.  When an alien challenges his detention \non the ground that he should not be removed in the first place, it is in substance a \nchallenge to his removal.  At issue here are several statutory provisions that do just \nthat.  First, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) deprives district courts of jurisdiction to review claims \narising  from  the  decision  or  action  to  “commence  proceedings.”    Second, \n§§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) deprive district courts of jurisdiction to review actions \ntaken or proceedings brought to remove aliens from the United States, and channel \nsuch challenges to the courts of appeals.  Third, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprives district \ncourts of jurisdiction to dictate to the Executive Branch where it must detain an alien \nduring removal proceedings.    \nAn emergency stay panel erroneously disregarded the above jurisdictional \nbars, and found that the government was unlikely to succeed on the merits of its \n \n1  Although the panel denied the consolidation motion, for this reason, the \ngovernment is filing the same petition in both cases.  \n \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 8 of 96\nappeals in these two cases.  Ultimately, the panel viewed the jurisdiction-stripping \nprovisions inapplicable insofar as petitioners purported to challenge their detention, \nthus declining to stay a district court order requiring the transfer of Ozturk from a \ndetention facility in Louisiana to one in Vermont, and declining to stay another order \ndirecting the immediate release of Mahdawi.  At every turn, the panel’s reasoning \nfundamentally conflicts with the language of § 1252, as well as with decisions of the \nSupreme Court, of this Court, and of other circuits interpreting those provisions.  \nAccordingly, rehearing en banc is warranted, and the government’s petition should \nbe granted.  \nRELEVANT BACKGROUND \nA.  Removal Proceedings and Judicial Oversight \n \nUnder the Immigration and Nationality Act (“INA”), 8 U.S.C. § 1101, et seq., \nremoval proceedings generally provide the exclusive means for determining whether \nan alien is both removable and eligible for any relief or protection from removal.  \nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1229a.  Section 1229, entitled “[i]nitiation of removal proceedings,” \nexplains that an alien must be given written notice of the initiation of removal \nproceedings though a charging document titled, “Notice to Appear.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1229.  To commence removal proceedings, the U.S. Department of Homeland \nSecurity (“DHS”) files the notice with the immigration court.  \n2 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 9 of 96\nRemoval  proceedings  are  conducted  before  an  immigration  judge.    Id. \n§ 1229a(a)(1).  “At the conclusion of [a removal] proceeding the immigration judge \nshall  decide  whether  an  alien  is  removable  from  the  United  States.”    Id. \n§ 1229a(c)(1)(A).  An immigration judge, however, does not have the last word in \nan alien’s immigration proceedings.  An alien can (and must, to preserve a claim) \nappeal  an  immigration  judge’s  decisions  to  the  Board  of  Immigration  Appeals \n(“BIA”).  See United States v. Gonzalez-Roque, 301 F.3d 39, 47-48 (2d Cir. 2002); \n8 C.F.R. § 1003.1 (setting out the organization, jurisdiction, and powers of the BIA).  \nAn alien’s order of removal does not become final until the BIA affirms the order, \nor the time permitted to appeal runs.  8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(47)(B).   \nAn alien may seek judicial review of the BIA’s decision by filing a petition \nfor review in the appropriate court of appeals.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a).  Congress \nhas repeatedly legislated to ensure federal circuit courts are the exclusive Article III \nforum for aliens to challenge their administrative proceedings.  Specifically, in 1996, \nCongress “comprehensive[ly]” amended the INA through passage of the Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (“IIRIRA”).  INS v. St. Cyr, \n533 U.S. 289, 291 (2001).  Among other reforms, IIRIRA eliminated district court \njurisdiction and provided that the courts of appeals oversee the immigration system \nexclusively through petitions for review.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1252 (codifying IIRIRA’s \njudicial review provisions, including later revisions discussed infra).  Congress again \n3 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 10 of 96\namended the INA through the REAL ID Act of 2005.  Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. DOJ, \n471 F.3d 315, 326 (2d Cir. 2006).  The REAL ID Act repeatedly inserted language \ninto the relevant provisions of 8 U.S.C. § 1252, clarifying that their jurisdiction-\nstripping  effects  apply  notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  law,  whether \n“statutory or nonstatutory.”  REAL ID Act, Pub. L. No. 109-13, § 106, 119 Stat. 231 \n(2005) (quoted language codified at 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(2)(A), (B), (C), (a)(4), \n(a)(5), (b)(9)).  Thus, Congress has repeatedly legislated to design, implement, and \nrefine a three-tier administrative and judicial system—namely, the immigration \ncourt, the BIA, and the Court of Appeals—to determine if and when an alien is \nremovable.  And Congress expressly excluded the district courts from that process.  \nB.  Factual and Procedural Background \n \ni.  Moshen Mahdawi \nMahdawi,  a  Palestinian,  is  a  lawful  permanent  resident.    No.  25-1113, \nECF#20, Ex. A, ¶¶8, 18, 19.  He also has a troubling and longstanding history with \nantisemitism  (among  other  things).    See  No. 2:25-CV-389,  Doc.42-3,  at  1-2 \n(Mahdawi was stopped at the border and found to be carrying drugs, including LSD, \nmethamphetamine, and illegal mushrooms, as well as more than $4,000 in U.S. \ncurrency); id., Doc.42-2, at 6 (Mahdawi was in the process of divorcing his wife, \nwho  asked  the  police  department  to  take  custody  of  a  shotgun  in  their  home \nfollowing a “non-physical argument” with him).  Most notably, on one occasion, \n4 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 11 of 96\nMahdawi visited a gun store, where he bragged about “kill[ing] Jews while he was \nin Palestine.”  Id., Doc.42-2, at 2.  Around that time, he also told someone he “like[d] \nto kill Jews.”  Id. at 4.  And it seems those sentiments continued at Columbia, where \nhe has been a central figure in recent campus protests that gripped the country.  \nOn April 14, 2025, Mahdawi was taken into DHS custody after Secretary of \nState Rubio determined that his presence and activities in the country were seriously \nadverse to American foreign policy.  No. 25-1113, ECF#20, Ex.A ¶¶3, 50; Ex.B.  \nDHS now seeks to remove Mahdawi pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C)(i), which \nrenders removable “[a]n alien whose presence or activities in the United States the \nSecretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious \nadverse foreign policy consequences for the United States.”  Id., Ex.A ¶¶5, 57.   \nOn April 14, 2025, Mahdawi filed a habeas petition in the District of Vermont \nbased on his alleged “retaliatory arrest and attempted removal.”  Id. ¶1.  He alleged \nthat he was “an outspoken critic of Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and an activist \nand organizer in student protests on Columbia’s campus until March of 2024,” and \nthat his arrest and detention are an attempt to “retaliate and punish noncitizens for \ntheir speech and expressive conduct related to Palestine and Israel.”  Id. ¶¶2, 4.  He \nasserted  claims  under  the  First  Amendment,  the  Due  Process  Clause,  the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and the non-delegation doctrine, and sought \nrelease on bail.  Id. ¶¶58-90.    \n5 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 12 of 96\nOn April 30, 2025, the district court released Mahdawi from custody.  See \nMahdawi v. Trump, -- F.Supp.3d --, 2025 WL 1243135, at *14 (D. Vt. Apr. 30, \n2025).  The district court concluded that the jurisdictional bars under 8 U.S.C. \n§§ 1252(g),  1226(e), 1252(a)(5),  and  1252(b)(9) did not preclude its review  of \nMahdawi’s habeas claims.  Id. at *4-8.  For the merits, the court concluded the \nconditions  for  relief  under  Mapp  v.  Reno,  241  F.3d  221  (2d  Cir.  2001),  were \nsatisfied.  Id. at *8-14.  \nii.  Rumeysa Ozturk \nOzturk is a citizen of Turkey.  No. 25-1019, ECF#19, Ex.A, ¶8.  She entered \nthe United States under a student visa.  Id. ¶8.  After the Department of State revoked \nher visa under 8 U.S.C. §1201(i), the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement \n(“ICE”) arrested Ozturk on March 25, 2025, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).  See id., \nEx.B, ¶5.  ICE served Ozturk with a Notice to Appear, charging her as removable \nunder 8 U.S.C. §1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien “whose nonimmigrant visa … has been \nrevoked under section 1201(i).”  Id. ¶14.  After staying at a facility in Vermont for \none night, ICE transported Ozturk to a detention facility in Louisiana.  Id. ¶¶18-19.  \nOzturk filed her original petition with the District of Massachusetts on the \nevening of March 25, 2025.  Id. ¶20.  Ozturk filed an amended petition, alleging \nviolations of the First and Fifth Amendments and the APA, and sought release on \nbail. Id., Ex.A.  Because Ozturk was, at the time of filing, detained in Vermont, the \n6 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 13 of 96\nMassachusetts district court transferred the action to the District of Vermont under \n28 U.S.C. § 1631.  Id., Ex.C.  \nOn  April  18,  2025,  the  district  court  issued  a  decision  denying  the \ngovernment’s motion to dismiss, and relying on the “equitable and flexible nature of \nhabeas relief,” the court ordered that Ozturk be transferred to ICE custody within the \nDistrict of Vermont no later than May 1, 2025.  Ozturk v. Trump, -- F.Supp. 3d --, \n2025 WL 1145250 (D. Vt. Apr. 18, 2025).  Regarding the jurisdictional bars under \n8  U.S.C.  §§  1201(i),  1226(e),  1252(g),  1252(a)(5),  and  1252(b)(9),  the  court \nconcluded that none barred its review of Ozturk’s habeas claims.  Id. at *10-15.   \nC.  The Panel Decisions  \nOn May 7 and 9, 2025, a three-judge motions panel denied the government’s \nemergency motions for a stay pending appeal.  No. 25-1019, ECF#71 (“Ozturk \nOp.”);  No.  25-1113,  ECF#86  (“Mahdawi  Op.”).2   The  decisions  in  both  cases \nsubstantially overlap, at least with respect to the issues raised herein.3   \n \n2  The panel’s opinions are published at Ozturk v. Hyde, --- F.4th ----, 2025 WL \n1318154 (2d Cir. May 7. 2025), and Mahdawi v. Trump, --- F.4th ----, 2025 WL \n1353665 (2d Cir. May 9, 2025). \n3  The Ozturk decision addressed venue issues that are not present in Mahdawi.  The \ngovernment reserves its right to challenge all aspects of both decisions, but for \npurposes of this application, focuses on the overlapping issues concerning the INA’s \njurisdiction-stripping provisions.  \n7 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 14 of 96\nFirst,  the  panel  addressed  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(g),  determining  that  the \ngovernment was unlikely to succeed on its arguments that § 1252(g) divested the \ndistrict court of jurisdiction, principally on the ground that petitioners’ challenges to \ndetention were independent of, or wholly collateral to, the removal process.  Ozturk \nOp.24-29; Mahdawi Op.9-13.  Second, the panel addressed 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) \nand (b)(9), similarly determining that the government was unlikely to succeed on its \narguments that those sections deprived the district court of jurisdiction, principally \non the grounds that such provisions are inapplicable where no removal orders are at \nissue,  or  at  least  where  petitioners’  unlawful  detention  claims  can  be  resolved \nwithout affecting the pending removal proceedings.  Ozturk Op.30-37; Mahdawi \nOp.13-17.  And third, with respect to the government’s separate argument that the \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction over DHS’s discretionary determinations of where \nto detain a particular alien, the panel determined that the government was unlikely \nto  succeed  on  its  argument  that  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  applied  to  such \ndecisions,  because  none  of  the  statutes  the  government  cited  provide  a  clear \nstatement.  Ozturk Op.19-23; Mahdawi Op.17-21.  \n// \n// \n// \n   \n8 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 15 of 96\nARGUMENT \nRehearing en banc is warranted where “the proceeding involves a question of \nexceptional importance.”  Fed. R. App. P. 35(a)(2).  That standard is satisfied.  The \npanel’s decisions conflict with the text of the statutes and with decisions of the \nSupreme Court and other circuits.  \nA.  The Panel Misapplied 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)  \n \nThe panel’s application of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) was in error.4  It rests on the \npremise that detention challenges are “independent of, or wholly collateral to, the \nremoval process,” which is at odds with the text of the statute and the Supreme \nCourt’s interpretation § 1252(g).   \nWhen an alien challenges his detention on the ground that he should not be \nremoved in the first place, it is in substance a challenge to his removal.  And when \nan alien challenges being detained in the process of being removed, that suit is one \nthat “aris[es] from the decision . . . to commence [removal] proceedings.”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g).  That is precisely the posture of these cases.  As the habeas petitions make \nclear, petitioners are not challenging some discrete aspect of their detention; they are \n \n4   8  U.S.C.  § 1252(g)  deprives  courts  of  jurisdiction,  including  habeas  corpus \njurisdiction, to review “any cause or claim by or on behalf of an alien arising from \nthe decision or action by [the Secretary of Homeland Security] to [1] commence \nproceedings, [2] adjudicate cases, or [3] execute removal orders against any alien \nunder this chapter.” \n9 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 16 of 96\nchallenging the fact that they are detained, on the ground that they cannot properly \nbe removed to begin with.  That falls within the heartland of § 1252(g).  See, e.g., \nAlvarez v. ICE, 818 F.3d 1194, 1203 (11th Cir. 2016) (“[§ 1252(g)] bars us from \nquestioning ICE’s discretionary decisions to commence removal” and reviewing \n“ICE’s  decision  to  take  him  into  custody  and  to  detain  him  during  removal \nproceedings.”); Humphries v. Various Fed. USINS Emps., 164 F.3d 936, 945 (5th \nCir. 1999) (similar); Limpin v. United States, 828 F. App’x 429, 429 (9th Cir. 2020) \n(“[C]laims  stemming  from  the  decision  to  arrest  and  detain  an  alien  at  the \ncommencement of removal proceedings are not within any court’s jurisdiction.”).   \nThe panel’s opinions rest entirely on bifurcating detention and removal—\nallowing suits to the former, regardless of their connection to the latter.  But that \nwould neuter the very purpose of § 1252(g): It would allow every alien to attack the \nmerits of his removal, through a habeas suit nominally challenging his detention; \nand in turn, the government would be subject to the sort of burdensome, parallel \nlitigation the INA endeavored to stop.  Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination \nComm., 525  U.S. 471, 482-86 (1999) (“AADC”).   Instead, what matters is the \n“substance” of the challenge.  Delgado v. Quarantillo, 643 F.3d 52, 55 (2d Cir. \n2011).  And where, as here, a challenge to detention is in substance a collateral attack \non the decision to remove, § 1252(g) bars it.   \n10 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 17 of 96\nThe practical import of the panel’s decisions is that detained aliens can file \nhabeas petitions that attack the validity of their removal proceedings or removal \norders, so long as they frame it as a detention challenge.  Such a result is contrary to \nstatute and flies in the face of congressional intent.  As the Supreme Court explained \nin  AADC,  § 1252(g)  was  “designed  to  give  some  measure  of  protection”  to \nimmigration authorities’ discretionary decisions regarding the commencement of \nremoval proceedings: Congress provided that if those decisions “are reviewable at \nall,  they  at  least  will  not  be  made  the  bases  for  separate  rounds  of  judicial \nintervention outside the streamlined process that Congress has designed.”  525 U.S. \nat  485;  see  8  U.S.C.  § 1226(e)  (stripping  review  over  certain  “discretionary \njudgments”).  Indeed, the “theme” of IIRIRA was to “protect[] the Executive’s \ndiscretion from the courts,” and consistent with that, § 1252(g) in particular was \n“directed at the deconstruction, fragmentation, and hence prolongation of removal \nproceedings.”  Id. at 486-87.   \nNotably, in AADC, where the Supreme Court held that materially identical \nclaims were proscribed by § 1252(g), nowhere did the Court hint that the exact same \ntheories  could  be  raised  in  federal  court,  just  captioned  as  a  challenge  to  the \ninterluding “detention,” versus the ultimate “removal.”  Nor would that make any \nsense under the opinion.  The entire logic of AADC was to bar certain parallel \nlitigation, and preserving ex ante litigation that would interrupt the “initiation and \n11 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 18 of 96\nprosecution of [the] various stages in the deportation process.”  525 U.S. at 484.  \nThat applies in full measure here, where petitioners are challenging being detained, \nas part of being removed.  The panel’s opinions deemed AADC as irrelevant simply \nbecause that case “did not sound in unlawful detention.”  Ozturk Op.29; Mahdawi \nOp.13.  But AADC cannot be limited in that way.  In short, § 1252(g) was designed, \nand has been interpreted by the Supreme Court, to preclude precisely the type of \ncases now before this Court.   \nB.  The Panel Misapplied 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9)  \nThe panel’s application of 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) also was in \nerror.5  It rests on the premise that such provisions are inapplicable where no removal \norders are at issue, or at least that petitioners’ unlawful detention claims can be \nresolved without affecting the pending removal proceedings.  But this reading of \n§ 1252(b)(9) is incorrect.  Only when an action is “unrelated to any removal action \nor proceeding” is it within the district court’s jurisdiction.  Ruiz v. Mukasey, 552 F.3d \n \n5  8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(9) provides:  \nJudicial review of all questions of law and fact, including interpretation and \napplication of constitutional and statutory provisions, arising from any action \ntaken or proceeding brought to remove an alien from the United States under \nthis subchapter shall be available only in judicial review of a final order under \nthis section. Except as otherwise provided in this section, no court shall have \njurisdiction . . . by any . . . provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory), to \nreview such an order or such questions of law or fact.  \n12 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 19 of 96\n269, 274 n.3 (2d Cir. 2009).  “[T]he substance of the relief that a plaintiff is seeking” \nwill dictate whether the district court has jurisdiction.  Delgado, 643 F.3d at 55.  If \nthe substance of a suit is an indirect challenge to a removal order, it is barred by the \nINA.  Id.; see also AADC, 525 U.S. at 483 (Section 1252(b)(9) is an “unmistakable \n‘zipper’  clause”  that  “channels  judicial  review  of  all  [claims]  arising  from \ndeportation  proceedings”  to  a  court  of  appeals  in  the  first  instance);  J.E.F.M. \nv. Lynch, 837 F.3d 1026, 1031 (9th Cir. 2016) (similar); Calcano-Martinez v. INS, \n232 F.3d 328, 340 (2d Cir. 2000) (similar).  \nIndeed, consistent with law and logic, the Supreme Court has already said as \nmuch.  In Jennings v. Rodriguez, the Court held that whatever § 1252(b)(9)’s precise \nbounds, it would reach a challenge to “the decision to detain [an alien] in the first \nplace” as part of removal.  583 U.S. 281, 294 (2018).  That is the issue here.  \nIn contrast, the panel’s opinions rest entirely on bifurcating detention and \nremoval.    But  again,  petitioners  do  not  bring  simple  detention  challenges  that \nordinarily may be cognizable.  Instead, the thrust of their claims is that their removal \nproceedings are unlawful, and so any detention incident to such invalid proceedings \nis likewise unlawful.  That is not a simple detention challenge that can be heard in \nhabeas.  That is a challenge to removal proceedings, regardless of how it is spun.  \nThe plain language of § 1252(b)(9) covers “all questions of law and fact . . . arising \nfrom  any  action  taken  or  proceeding  brought  to  remove  an  alien”—that  broad \n13 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 20 of 96\nlanguage  covers  detention-related  challenges  such  as  petitioners’  where  such \nchallenges  are  inextricably  intertwined  with  challenges  to  the  validity  of  their \nremoval proceedings.  See, e.g., Gonzalez-Alarcon v. Macias, 884 F.3d 1266, 1275 \n(10th Cir. 2018) (“Although Gonzalez-Alacron seeks release from detention, his \nclaim  is  based  on  the  alleged  invalidity  of  his  removal  order.”);  Martinez \nv. Napolitano, 704 F.3d 620, 623 (9th Cir. 2012) (“When a claim by an alien, \nhowever  it  is  framed,  challenges  the  procedure  and  substance  of  an  agency \ndetermination that is inextricably linked to the order of removal, it is prohibited by \nsection  1252(a)(5).”);  Delgado,  643  F.3d  at  55  (if  petitioner  “is  indirectly \nchallenging her reinstated order of removal, ... we hold that section 1252(a)(5)’s \njurisdictional bar applies equally to preclude such an indirect challenge”).   \nFurther, contrary to the panel’s view, the fact that petitioners do not currently \nhave final removal orders does not render § 1252(b)(9) inapplicable.  To require a \nremoval order before triggering the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of § 1252 is \nunsupported by the statutory text and undermines the administrative system as a \nwhole.  Section 1252 requires an alien to exhaust all issues first in immigration court \nand at the BIA, and then once subject to a final removal order, he or she may seek \njudicial review of any legal, constitutional, or factual question in the court of appeals \nthrough a petition for review.  See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5), (b)(9); see also Ajlani \nv. Chertoff, 545 F.3d 229, 235 (2d Cir. 2008); accord Monsalvo v. Bondi, 145 S. Ct. \n14 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 21 of 96\n1232, 1241 (2025). (“Section 1252 permits individuals to petition for judicial review \nof ‘final orders of removal’ and indicates that those petitions supply the exclusive \nmeans for securing ‘[j]udicial review of all questions of law.’” (emphasis added)).  \nCongress devised that process, and petitioners should not be permitted to circumvent \nit.  Allowing such claims to proceed in district court would welcome the precise \nfront-end district court litigation that the provisions in § 1252 were designed to stop.   \nC.  The Panel Misapplied 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  \nThe panel’s application of 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) also was in error.6  \nCourts lack authority to dictate to the Executive Branch where it must detain an alien \nduring removal proceedings.  That rule follows from a straightforward application \nof the INA: 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) gives DHS broad discretion over whether to detain \nan  alien  during  removal  proceedings;  8  U.S.C.  § 1231(g)  gives  the  Secretary \nauthority to “arrange appropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending \nremoval  or  a  decision  on  removal”;  and  8  U.S.C.  § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)  strips \njurisdiction for federal courts to review that sort of discretionary determination.  See, \ne.g., Van Dinh v. Reno, 197 F.3d 427, 433 (10th Cir. 1999).   \n \n6  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) precludes jurisdiction “to review . . . any . . . decision \nor  action  of  the  Attorney  General  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  the \nauthority for which is specified under this subchapter to be in the discretion of the \nAttorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security.”  \n15 \n\n Case: 25-1113, 05/18/2025, DktEntry: 93.1, Page 22 of 96\nRelying on Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 247 (2010), the panel explained \nthe jurisdictional bar of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) “applies only to those decisions where \nCongress has expressly set out the Attorney General’s discretionary authority in the \nstatute.”  Ozturk Op.20-21; Mahdawi Op.18.  And finding no “clear statement” \nspecifically rendering the determination of where to house an alien to be within the \nSecretary’s discretion—in either § 1226(a) or § 1231(g)—the panel determined that \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) did not apply.   \nBut the panel’s decisions take an overly cribbed view of the statutes.  As this \nCourt recognized, “statutory discretion” can come in many forms, including where \nthe Secretary is given the power to do something, without simultaneously “required” \nto do so in any “particular” way.  Wood v. United States, 175 F. App’x 419, 420 (2d \nCir. 2006).  So much so here: The Secretary has discretion over whether and where \nto  detain  aliens  like  petitioners  here;  that  sort  of  “discretionary  judgment”  is \nunreviewable.

PARKER, SUSAN L. CARNEY, and ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judges: \nRümeysa Öztürk is a graduate student who had, until recently, been living \nin Massachusetts lawfully on a student visa.  On March 25, 2025, six plainclothes \nlaw enforcement officers arrested Öztürk near her home without warning and \ndrove her away in an unmarked car.  Unaware of her location and unable to \ncontact their client, Öztürk’s counsel brought a habeas petition in the District of \nMassachusetts.  The petition alleges that Öztürk was arrested and is now detained \nbased solely on an op-ed she wrote over a year before her arrest.  But, when the \npetition was filed, Öztürk had already been driven across state lines to Vermont.  \nAnd when the government eventually disclosed Öztürk’s location nearly twenty-\nfour hours later, she had again been moved, this time to a correctional facility in \nLouisiana.  \n  The habeas petition filed in Massachusetts was transferred to the District of \nVermont, and the district court has set an expeditious schedule for a bail hearing \nand to resolve the constitutional claims made in the habeas petition.  In aid of this \nresolution, the district court ordered the government to transport Öztürk from \nimmigration  custody  in  Louisiana  to  immigration  custody  in  the  District  of \nVermont.    Although  proceedings  continue  in  the  District  of  Vermont,  the \ngovernment  now  appeals  the  district  court’s  order.    Before  this  panel,  the \n1 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 12,8 P oafg 9e6 4 of 45\ngovernment seeks an emergency stay of this transfer order pending appeal.  We \nconclude that the government has failed to meet its burden to justify such a stay.  \nFirst, the government has failed to show that it is likely to succeed on the \nmerits  of  its  appeal.    The  District  of  Vermont  is  likely  the  proper  venue  to \nadjudicate  Öztürk’s  habeas  petition  because,  at  the  time  she  filed,  she  was \nphysically in Vermont and her immediate custodian was unknown.  Furthermore, \nwe conclude that the government is unlikely to prevail on its arguments that \nvarious jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n(“INA”) on which the government relies deprive the district court of jurisdiction \nover Öztürk’s challenge to her detention.  \nSecond, the government has failed to show irreparable injury absent a stay \nof the transfer order.  Contrary to its arguments, the transfer order does not \nprevent it from effectuating any duly enacted law.  If the government were to \nprevail on this appeal, Öztürk would return to immigration custody in Louisiana.  \nAnd in the interim, Öztürk’s immigration removal proceedings will continue in \nLouisiana.  Finally, the balance of the equities disfavors a stay. Öztürk’s interest in \nparticipating  in  her  scheduled  habeas  proceedings  in  person  outweighs  the \ngovernment’s purported administrative and logistical costs.  \n2 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 12,9 P oafg 9e6 5 of 45\nFor these reasons, the government’s motion for a stay is DENIED, the \ngovernment’s  request  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  is  also  DENIED,  and  the \nadministrative stay entered by this Court is hereby VACATED.  The government \nis hereby ORDERED to comply with the district court’s transfer order within one \nweek of the date of this opinion.  Accordingly, the district court’s April 18, 2025 \nOrder is hereby amended as follows: “To support the Court’s resolution of these \nissues, the Court orders that Ms. Öztürk be physically transferred to ICE custody \nwithin the District of Vermont no later than May 14, 2025.” \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis case arises from the arrest and detention of Rümeysa Öztürk, a young \nTurkish student who entered the United States legally pursuant to a valid F-1 \nstudent visa.  Öztürk is a third-year doctoral candidate in Child Study and Human \nDevelopment  at  Tufts  University,  and  has  been  residing  in  Somerville, \nMassachusetts.  Öztürk was arrested on March 25, 2025, and has been detained at \na correctional facility in Louisiana ever since.   \nTo date, the only justification the government has provided for her arrest \nand  detention  is  that  the  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (“DHS”)  and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”) made an assessment that she “had \nbeen involved in associations that ‘may undermine U.S foreign policy by creating \n3 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 13,0 P oafg 9e6 6 of 45\na hostile environment for Jewish students and indicating support for a designated \nterrorist organization’ including co-authoring an op-ed that found common cause \nwith an organization that was later temporarily banned from campus.”  Ozturk v. \nTrump, No. 2:25-cv-374, 2025 WL 1145250, at *17 (D. Vt. Apr. 18, 2025) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe opinion editorial, which was co-authored by Öztürk and three other \nTufts students, was published last year on March 26, 2024.  It expressed strong \nviews on an undisputedly controversial topic, criticizing the University’s response \nto three resolutions passed by the Tufts Community Union Senate that would have \nthe University “acknowledge the Palestinian genocide, apologize for University \nPresident Sunil Kumar’s statements, disclose its investments and divest from \ncompanies with direct or indirect ties to Israel.”  Rumeysa Ozturk et al., Op-ed: Try \nAgain, President Kumar: Renewing Calls for Tufts to Adopt March 4 TCU Senate \nResolutions, The Tufts Daily (Mar. 26, 2024), available at https://www.tuftsdaily.\ncom/article/2024/03/4ftk27sm6jkj [https://perma.cc/84ZQ-EVZ7].  \nOn March 21, 2025, the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs \napproved revocation of Öztürk’s F-1 visa.  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *2.  The \napproval was, apparently, based solely on the assessment by DHS and ICE that \n4 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 13,1 P oafg 9e6 7 of 45\nÖztürk’s coauthorship of the op-ed a year earlier demonstrated her involvement \n-\nin organizations that “may undermine U.S. foreign policy.”  Id. at *17.  Öztürk was \nnot informed that DHS and ICE were considering seeking her visa revocation, nor \nthat such a determination was made.  The Armstrong Memo stated that “[d]ue to \nongoing ICE operational security, this revocation will be silent; the Department of \nState will not notify the subject of the revocation.”  Id. at *3 (emphasis added).  \nFour days later, six heavily armed, plainclothes officers, some masked, \narrested Öztürk without warning on the street near her residence and drove her \naway in an unmarked vehicle, crossing state lines and transporting her first to \nNew Hampshire, then to Vermont, and the next day, flying her to a correctional \nfacility in Basile, Louisiana, where she remains in custody. \nÖztürk was not afforded an opportunity to speak with counsel or to tell \nanyone where she was until after her arrival in Louisiana, almost twenty-four \nhours after her arrest in Massachusetts.  Counsel’s efforts to determine where she \nwas detained in the hours after her arrest were unsuccessful.  Thus, that evening, \nher counsel filed a habeas petition in the District of Massachusetts—her last known \nlocation—seeking her release.  The Massachusetts district court then ordered that \n5 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 13,2 P oafg 9e6 8 of 45\nshe not be transferred out of Massachusetts.  But at this point Öztürk was already \nin Vermont.  ICE agents proceeded to transport her to Louisiana. \nBecause Öztürk was detained in Vermont at the time her habeas petition \nwas filed, Judge Denise L. Casper of the District of Massachusetts soon transferred \nthis case to the District of Vermont, where the case was assigned to Judge William \nK. Sessions III.  Ozturk v. Trump, 25-cv-10695, 2025 WL 1009445, at *11 (D. Mass. \nApr. 4, 2025); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1631. \nIn her amended habeas petition, Öztürk alleges that her arrest and detention \nwere unlawfully “designed to punish her speech and chill the speech of others.”  \nMot. Ex. A (Amended Habeas Petition, hereinafter “Pet.”) at 2 ¶ 3.  She does not \nchallenge the revocation of her visa, and she is not subject to an order of removal.  \nThe government moved to dismiss the petition.  In a careful and thoughtful \nopinion, Judge Sessions denied the government’s motion and scheduled a bail \nhearing (for May 9) and a hearing on the habeas petition (for May 22).  The district \ncourt  also  ordered  that  Öztürk  be  transferred  to  immigration  custody  in  the \nDistrict of Vermont in order to facilitate those proceedings. \nBefore us is the government’s emergency motion seeking a stay pending \nappeal  of  the  district  court’s  order  dated  April  18,  2025,  which  directs  the \n6 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/01189/2, 00255/0, 7D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 7g1e. 13,3 P oafg 9e6 9 of 45\ngovernment to return Öztürk from Louisiana to the District of Vermont.  Öztürk \nargues that we lack appellate jurisdiction over an appeal from Judge Sessions’ \norder, and she otherwise opposes the motion.   \nII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION \nAs a threshold matter, Öztürk argues that we lack jurisdiction over the \ngovernment’s interlocutory appeal from the district court’s order that she “be \nphysically transferred to ICE custody within the District of Vermont no later than \nMay 1, 2025.”  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *25.  Specifically, she contends that we \ncannot review this interlocutory order because it is not an injunction, was not \ncertified  by  the  district  court  to  this  Court,  and  is  not  appealable  under  the \ncollateral order doctrine.  We disagree.   \nIn Shoop v. Twyford, the Supreme Court held that, pursuant to the collateral \norder doctrine, federal courts of appeal have appellate jurisdiction to review a \ntransportation order under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651.  596 U.S. 811, 817 \nn.1 (2022).  We are bound by that conclusion.  Accordingly, we conclude that this \nCourt has jurisdiction over the stay motion. \nIII.  STAY PENDING APPEAL  \nA stay is “an exercise of judicial discretion and the propriety of its issue is \ndependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. \n7 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 4P aogf e9 610 of 45\n418,  433  (2009)  (alterations  adopted)  (quotation  marks  omitted).    “The  party \nrequesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the circumstances justify an \nexercise of [the Court’s] discretion.”  Id. at 433–34.  The four stay factors are “(1) \nwhether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed \non the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; \n(3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested \nin the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.”  Id. at 434 (quotation \nmarks omitted).  “The first two factors . . . are the most critical.”  Id.  And where \n“the government is a party to the suit, the final two factors merge.”  New York v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 969 F.3d 42, 58–59 (2d Cir. 2020).  We deny the stay \nbecause the government has not met its burden on any of the factors. \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n1.  District of Confinement and Immediate Custodian   \nWe begin with two traditional requirements for a federal court to entertain \na habeas petition: that the petition be filed in the district of confinement and that \nit name the petitioner’s immediate custodian.  See Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. 426, \n438 (2004); see also 28 U.S.C. § 2242.  Generally, “[w]henever a § 2241 habeas \npetitioner  seeks  to  challenge  his  present  physical  custody  within  the  United \nStates,” he must file the petition in the district of confinement and name his \n8 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 5P aogf e9 611 of 45\nimmediate custodian as the respondent.  Padilla, 542 U.S. at 447.  Öztürk filed her \noriginal habeas petition in the District of Massachusetts on March 25, 2025 at \napproximately 10pm, naming as respondents Patricia Hyde, the New England \nField  Office  Director  of  ICE;  Michael  Krol,  ICE’s  Homeland  Security \nInvestigation’s New England Special Agent in Charge; Todd Lyons, the Acting \nDirector  of  ICE; and Kristi Noem,  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security.    The \ngovernment argues that, because the petition was not filed in Öztürk’s district of \nconfinement and did not name Öztürk’s immediate custodian, “the order below \nwas unlawful because the district court does not have habeas jurisdiction over this \ncase in the first place.”  Mot. at 10.   \nAny  confusion  about  where  habeas  jurisdiction  resides  arises  from  the \ngovernment’s conduct during the twenty-four hours following Öztürk’s arrest.  \nÖztürk was arrested near her residence in Somerville, Massachusetts, at about \n5:25pm on March 25, 2025.  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1009445, at *2 .  ICE officers departed \nSomerville with Öztürk at 5:49pm.  Id.  At 10:28pm, after being transferred to \nMethuen, Massachusetts, and then to Lebanon, New Hampshire, Öztürk arrived \nat an ICE field office in St. Albans, Vermont, where she spent the next six hours.  \n9 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 6P aogf e9 612 of 45\nId.    At  4:00am  on  March  26,  2025,  Öztürk  was  transported  to  the  airport  in \nBurlington, Vermont and then to Louisiana, where she arrived at 2:35pm.  Id.  \nÖztürk’s counsel “repeatedly attempted to ascertain her location” in the \nhours following her arrest.  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *3; see also Opp. at 4–5.  \nAfter their initial efforts failed, counsel filed Öztürk’s original habeas petition in \nthe  District  of  Massachusetts—her  last  known  location—at  approximately \n10:01pm.  See Mot. at 5; Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *2; Ozturk, 2025 WL 1009445, \nat *1.  It is now undisputed that at that time, Öztürk was not in the District of \nMassachusetts—she was already in Vermont.  Accordingly, the Massachusetts \ndistrict court found it lacked habeas jurisdiction and transferred the petition to \nVermont under 28 U.S.C. § 1631.  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1009445, at *11.  \nThe  government  now  argues  that  this  transfer  was  improper.    The \ngovernment is wrong.  28 U.S.C. § 1631 provides “[w]henever a civil action . . . is \nnoticed for or filed with . . . a court and that court finds that there is a want of \njurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or \nappeal to any other such court . . . in which the action or appeal could have been \nbrought at the time it was filed or noticed.”  The Supreme Court has made clear \n“the  general  rule  that  for  core  habeas  petitions  challenging  present  physical \n10 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 7P aogf e9 613 of 45\nconfinement, jurisdiction lies in only one district: the district of confinement.”  \nPadilla, 542 U.S. at 443.  At the time the petition was filed, that “one district” was \nthe District of Vermont, where Öztürk was in transit to an ICE facility for the night.  \nVermont is therefore the only district in which the petition could have been \nbrought at the time it was filed, and thus the only district to which it could be \ntransferred under § 1631.  True, if the district court found that transfer was not in \nthe interest of justice, it could have dismissed the petition without prejudice, as \nthe Supreme Court did in Padilla—but the government presents no reason to call \ninto doubt the district court’s conclusion that transfer was “in the interest of \njustice.”1 \nThe government argues that § 1631 cannot convey “substantive authority” \nthe court would otherwise lack.  Mot. at 13.  That is true.  The only effect of the \ntransfer statute is that “the action or appeal shall proceed as if it had been filed in \n \n1 And there are many reasons supporting its conclusion, not least that dismissing \nthe petition would have the effect of vacating the order entered in the District of \nMassachusetts  prohibiting  the  government  from  removing  Öztürk  from  the \ncountry  until  further  court  order.    Dismissing  the  petition  would  also \nunnecessarily delay the resolution of Öztürk’s claims.  Further, we have held that \n“a finding that the original action was filed in good faith” weighs in favor of \ntransfer rather than dismissal.  Liriano v. United States, 95 F.3d 119, 122 (2d Cir. \n1996), as amended (Oct. 7, 1996). The government has presented no basis to believe \nthat the original petition was not filed in good faith. \n11 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 8P aogf e9 614 of 45\nor noticed for the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was \nactually filed in or noticed for the court from which it is transferred.”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1631.  If the transferee court would have lacked jurisdiction had the action been \nfiled there, transfer does not cure that error.  Thus, in De Ping Wang v. Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec., where a petition was both untimely filed and filed in the wrong \ncourt, transferring it to the proper court could not change the fact that it was \nuntimely.  484 F.3d 615, 617–18 (2d Cir. 2007).  Not so here.  Had the petition been \nfiled in the District of Vermont at 10:01pm on March 25, the case would have \nproperly  been  before  that  court.    The  action’s  transfer  merely  remedies  the \nprocedural defect—it conveys no substantive authority the court would otherwise \nlack.2 \nNor does Öztürk’s own subsequent transfer to Louisiana strip the District \nof Vermont of habeas jurisdiction.  The Supreme Court’s decision in Ex parte Endo, \n323 U.S. 283 (1944), “stands for the important but limited proposition that when \nthe Government moves a habeas petitioner after she properly files a petition \nnaming her immediate custodian, the District Court retains jurisdiction and may \n \n2 Since neither the parties nor the district court relied on 28 US.C. §§1404(a) or \n1406(a) in transferring Öztürk’s habeas petition, we express no view as to whether \ntransferring a petition pursuant to these provisions would similarly cure this \ndefect. \n12 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 3, 9P aogf e9 615 of 45\ndirect the writ to any respondent within its jurisdiction who has legal authority to \neffectuate the prisoner’s release.”  Padilla, 542 U.S. at 441.  The government argues \nthat the petition was not “properly filed” in Vermont, and so the district court \nnever obtained any jurisdiction that it could then “retain.”  Mot. at 8 n.3, 14.  But \nthe effect of a transfer under § 1631 is that we must treat the petition as if it were, \nin fact, filed in Vermont at 10:01pm, when Öztürk was present in the district.  The \ngovernment concedes that had the petition been filed in Vermont at that time, \nhabeas jurisdiction would be proper there.  Under § 1631, the transferee court \ninherits the filing time of the transferor court: in effect, the petition was filed in \nVermont at approximately 10:01pm, and consequently the Vermont district court \nobtained  jurisdiction  at  that  time  and  retains  it  even  in  light  of  Öztürk’s \nsubsequent transfer to Louisiana.    For these reasons, the government is not likely \nto  prevail  on  the  theory  that  the  district-of-confinement  rule  bars  habeas \njurisdiction in the District of Vermont. \nNext, the government argues Öztürk’s failure to name her “immediate \ncustodian” is fatal to her petition.  Mot. at 14–15.  28 U.S.C. § 2242 provides that an \napplication for habeas relief should allege “the name of the person who has \ncustody over him and by virtue of what claim or authority, if known.”  28 U.S.C. \n13 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 0P aogf e9 616 of 45\n§ 2242 (emphasis added). Generally, this requires the petitioner to name their \n“immediate”  custodian.    Wales  v.  Whitney,  114  U.S.  564,  574  (1885).    More \nspecifically, “the default rule is that the proper respondent is the warden of the \nfacility where the prisoner is being held.”  Padilla, 542 U.S. at 435.  However, in \ncases where the petitioner “is held in an undisclosed location by an unknown \ncustodian, it is impossible to apply” this rule.  Id. at 450 n.18.  In “these very limited \nand special circumstances,” the naming of a more remote custodian—here, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security—satisfies the statutory requirements.  Demjanjuk \nv. Meese, 784 F.2d 1114, 1116 (D.C. Cir. 1986). \nHere, the government did not disclose to Öztürk’s counsel where, or by \nwhom, she was being detained and did not allow Öztürk to contact counsel or \nconvey her whereabouts to anyone until almost twenty-four hours after her arrest.  \nIndeed, the government concedes that it withheld this information intentionally.  \nIt stated below that it “does not permit immigration detainees ‘to communicate \nabout their location while enroute between detention facilities,’ because doing so \n‘would raise serious security concerns.’”  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *9 (quoting \nDist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 83 at 13).  The government contends that, even though it is \nundisputed that Öztürk’s counsel did not know and could not find out who her \n14 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 1P aogf e9 617 of 45\nimmediate custodian was when her petition was filed (and the government still \nhas not identified who that was), the “unknown custodian exception” does not \napply here.  Rather, the government argues that this exception applies only where \nthe custodian’s identity is a “prolonged secret.”  Mot. at 14.  \nThe  government  cites  no  statute  or  case  law  for  this  extraordinary \nproposition, the practical effect of which would be that for some unspecified \nperiod of time after detention—seemingly however long the government chooses \nto take in transporting a detainee between states or between facilities—a detainee \nwould be unable to file a habeas petition at all, anywhere.  Such a rule finds no \nsupport in the law and is contrary to longstanding tradition.  See 3 William \nBlackstone, Commentaries *131; Paul D. Halliday, Habeas Corpus: From England \nto  Empire  161  (2012  edition)  (“By  exploring  hundreds  of  cases  across  many \ndecades,  we  can  gain  a  sense  of  practices  and  principles,  if  not  rules,  that \nconstituted a jurisprudence of normalcy. At the center of this jurisprudence stood \nthe idea that the court might inspect imprisonment orders made at any time, \nanywhere, by any authority.”); see also Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 739–46 \n(2008).  In any event, the plain text of 28 U.S.C. § 2242, requiring the petitioner to \n15 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 2P aogf e9 618 of 45\nidentify the immediate custodian “if known,” likely precludes the government’s \nproposed rule. \nEven if the unknown custodian exception does not apply, Öztürk’s original \npetition named Patricia Hyde, who it identified as ICE’s New England Field Office \nDirector.  Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 1 at 1–2.  Because Öztürk was in transit when her \npetition was filed, Öztürk contends that Hyde was in fact her immediate custodian \nduring that period.  See Opp. at 12.  The government has never clarified who, if it \nwas not Hyde, had immediate custody of Öztürk in transit, declining to answer \ndirect questions from the district court and from this Court when asked.3  See \nOzturk, 2025 WL 114525024, at *8 (citing Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 98 at 30–31).  Thus, \neither the custodian was Hyde, whom the petition named, or it was not Hyde and \n \n3 At oral argument before this Court, the government first stated that it does not \nknow  who  Öztürk’s  immediate  custodian  was  while  she  was  in  transit  at \napproximately 10:01pm and then took the novel position that Öztürk’s immediate \ncustodian at that time was the warden of the Vermont facility to which she had \nnot yet arrived.  The government cited no authority for this contention, and it is at \nodds with the straightforward rule set out in Padilla that the proper respondent to \na habeas petition is “’the person with the ability to produce the prisoner’s body \nbefore the habeas court.”  542 U.S. at 435 (quotation marks omitted).  As the \nSupreme Court instructed in Padilla, “the default rule is that the proper respondent \nis the warden of the facility where the prisoner is being held,” id. (emphasis \nadded), not the person who will at some unspecified future time have the ability \nto produce the prisoner’s body or the warden of a facility where the prisoner is not \nyet being held. \n16 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 3P aogf e9 619 of 45\nthe custodian remains unknown.  On this record, the government has not shown \na likelihood of success on its claim that Öztürk’s original habeas petition was \ndeficient for any failure to name her immediate custodian at the time of filing. \nFinally, the government argues that even if the Vermont district court had \nhabeas jurisdiction over the original petition, filed while Öztürk was physically \npresent in Vermont, it lacks jurisdiction over Öztürk’s amended petition, filed on \nMarch 28, when Öztürk was physically present in Louisiana.  Mot. at 15–16.  The \ngovernment refers us to Royal Canin U. S. A., Inc. v. Wullschleger, 604 U.S. 22 (2025), \nin support.  Royal Canin stands for the proposition that where a plaintiff files a \ncomplaint in federal court raising both federal and state law claims and later \namends the complaint to remove the federal claims, the court lacks subject matter \njurisdiction over the amended complaint.  Id. at 33–34.  Royal Canin is plainly \ninapposite.  As the Supreme Court has held, questions of habeas jurisdiction use \nthe word jurisdiction “in the sense that it is used in the habeas statute, 28 U.S.C. \n§ 2241(a), and not in the sense of subject-matter jurisdiction of the District Court.”  \nPadilla, 542 U.S. at 434 n.7.  In fact, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide \nthat an “amendment to a pleading relates back to the date of the original pleading \nwhen . . . the amendment changes the party or the naming of the party against \n17 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 4P aogf e9 620 of 45\nwhom a claim is asserted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(C).  The government cites no \nauthority for its contention that jurisdiction within the meaning of the habeas \nstatute is evaluated anew when the petition is amended and may not relate back \nto  the  date  of  the  original  pleading  pursuant  to  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil \nProcedure. \n2.  Jurisdiction-Stripping Provisions of the INA \nThe remainder of the government’s arguments for why it is likely to succeed \non  the  merits  are  primarily  jurisdictional  in  nature.    It  contends  first  that \njurisdiction-stripping  provisions  of  the  INA  deprived  the  district  court  of \nauthority to order the government to transfer Öztürk to Vermont.  Then it argues \nthat various other provisions of the INA stripped the district court of jurisdiction \nover Öztürk’s petition as a whole.  These arguments are unlikely to succeed in no \nsmall part because our analysis is guided by longstanding principles of statutory \ninterpretation requiring Congress to speak clearly and specifically when it wishes \nto deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction.  Repeatedly, including in the INA \ncontext, the Supreme Court has declared that we should “take account . . . of the \npresumption favoring interpretations of statutes [to] allow judicial review . . . \nabsent clear statement.”  Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 237 (2010) (quotation marks \nand citation omitted); see also McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., 498 U.S. 479, 483–\n18 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 5P aogf e9 621 of 45\n84  (1991)  (“We  hold  that  given  the  absence  of  clear  congressional  language \nmandating  preclusion  of  federal  jurisdiction  and  the  nature  of  respondents’ \nrequested relief, the District Court had jurisdiction . . . .”); Bowen v. Michigan Acad. \nof Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 671 (1986) (“[O]nly upon a showing of clear and \nconvincing evidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict \naccess to judicial review.” (quotation marks omitted)).  Because Öztürk challenges \nher arrest and detention, and not her removal, we find that the government is \nunlikely to make such a showing.  \na.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \nWe begin with the argument that the district court lacked authority to order \nthe government to transfer Öztürk to immigration custody in Vermont.  The \ndistrict court premised its power to order Öztürk’s transfer to Vermont on both \nthe “equitable and flexible nature of habeas relief” and its authority under the All \nWrits Act.  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *23 (quotation marks omitted).  The district \ncourt undeniably has an “inherent authority to protect [its] proceedings,” Degen v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 820, 823 (1996), and to “meet new situations which demand \nequitable  intervention,  and  to  accord  all  the  relief  necessary  to  correct  the \nparticular injustices involved in these situations,” Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-\n19 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 6P aogf e9 622 of 45\nEmpire Co., 322 U.S. 238, 248 (1944).  The district court concluded that the equities \nstrongly favored Öztürk’s transfer to ICE custody in Vermont. \n  The  government  argues  that  the  decision  where  to  detain  a  noncitizen \npending removal proceedings is committed to the discretion of the Secretary of \nHomeland  Security  and  that  the  INA  precludes  judicial  review  over  such \ndiscretionary  decisions.    In  support,  the  government  cites  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which precludes the exercise of federal court jurisdiction “to \nreview . . . any . . . decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to \nbe  in  the  discretion  of  the  Attorney  General  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  The government argues \nthat a different statute, 8 U.S.C. § 1231(g), “specifie[s]” that the decision to detain \nimmigrants  in,  and  transfer  immigrants  to,  the  custodial  location  of  the \ngovernment’s choice is within the executive branch’s discretion, barring judicial \nreview.  The government is unlikely to succeed on that argument. \nTo begin with, § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s bar on jurisdiction applies only to those \ndecisions  where  Congress  has  expressly  “set  out  the  Attorney  General’s \n20 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 7P aogf e9 623 of 45\ndiscretionary authority in the statute.” 4  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 247.  Crucially, the \nquestion is not whether § 1231(g) “require[s] an exercise of discretion” because \neven if it “probably do[es],” the crux is “whether the text . . . specifies that the \ndecision is in the discretion of the Attorney General.”  Nethagani v. Mukasey, 532 \nF.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  We have held that “when a statute \nauthorizes the Attorney General to make a determination, but lacks additional \nlanguage specifically rendering that determination to be within his discretion \n(e.g., ‘in the discretion of the Attorney General,’ ‘to the satisfaction of the Attorney \nGeneral,’ etc.), the decision is not one that is ‘specified . . . to be in the discretion of \nthe Attorney General’ for purposes of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Id. at 154–55.  \nSection 1231(g) has no such additional language.  It merely states that “[t]he \nAttorney General  shall  arrange  for appropriate places  of detention  for  aliens \ndetained pending removal or a decision on removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  Far \nfrom specifying discretion, § 1231(g) uses the obligatory “shall” rather than a \npermissive “may.”  This stands “in stark contrast to other sections of the INA,” \n \n4  As  part  of  transferring  many  immigration-related  responsibilities  from  the \nAttorney General to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, “the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 mandates that references to the Attorney General \nare deemed to include DHS where, as here, the relevant agency functions have \nbeen transferred from the Department of Justice to DHS.”  Shabaj v. Holder, 718 \nF.3d 48, 51 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing 6 U.S.C. § 557); see also 6 U.S.C. § 202. \n21 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 8P aogf e9 624 of 45\nwhich both use permissive verbs and include additional language specifying that \nthose decisions that are within the Attorney General or DHS Secretary’s discretion. \nAguilar v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs Enf’t Div. of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1, 20 \n(1st Cir. 2007); cf., e.g., 8 U.S.C. § 1157(c)(1) (“[T]he Attorney General may, in the \nAttorney General’s discretion . . . .” (emphasis added)).  When “Congress includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the \nsame Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely \nin the disparate inclusion or exclusion.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 430 (quotation marks \nomitted).5   Furthermore, as explained above, with respect to § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) \nexactly, the Supreme Court has applied the “presumption favoring interpretations \nof statutes [to] allow judicial review . . . absent clear statement.” Kucana, 558 U.S. \n \n5 In fact, the very next sentence of § 1231(g)(1) uses the permissive “may,” and the \nsubsection appears to relate “more centrally to the government’s brick and mortar \nobligations for obtaining facilities in which to detain aliens.”  Reyna as next friend \nof J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d 204, 209 (4th Cir. 2019).  Section 1231(g) first provides that \nthe Attorney General “shall arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens \ndetained pending removal or a decision on removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  If such \nfacilities “are unavailable,” the statute then provides that “the Attorney General \nmay expend” from specified appropriations “amounts necessary to acquire land \nand to acquire, build, remodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living \nquarters  for  immigration  officers  if  not  otherwise  available)  necessary  for \ndetention.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n22 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 4, 9P aogf e9 625 of 45\nat 237 (quotation marks omitted).  Under these circumstances, we do not believe \nthat § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), by operation of § 1231(g), forecloses judicial review.   \nWith respect to transfer in particular, “§ 1231(g) does not address transfers \n[of noncitizen detainees] at all,” and it surely does not “explicitly grant the \nAttorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security discretion with respect to \ntransfers.”  Reyna as next friend of J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d 204, 209 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(emphases added).  Accordingly, even if the discretionary authority to transfer a \ndetainee between facilities is contemplated under § 1231(g), such authority is \nmerely implied.  See id. at 210 (though discretion to transfer detainees “might \nrightfully  [be]  locate[d]”  under  §  1231(g),  “the  authority  is  implied,”  and  “§ \n1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) . . . requires that discretionary authority be specified, i.e., made \nexplicit, in order to be unreviewable”); Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 20 (“[S]ection 1231(g) \nfails  to  ‘specify’  that  individualized  transfer  decisions  are  in  the  Attorney \nGeneral’s discretion.”).   \nFor these reasons, we conclude the government has failed to demonstrate \nthat it is likely to succeed on its contention that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) strips the district \ncourt of authority to order Öztürk’s custodial transfer. \nb.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g)  \n23 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 0P aogf e9 626 of 45\nThe  government  also  asserts  that  §  1252(g)  strips  the  district  court  of \njurisdiction to hear Öztürk’s habeas claims, thus warranting a stay of the district \ncourt’s transfer order.  Section 1252(g) prohibits courts from “hear[ing] any cause \nor claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the \nAttorney General [or Secretary of Homeland Security] to commence proceedings, \nadjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(g).  That language supposedly includes Öztürk’s claims. \nThe government dramatically overstates the reach of § 1252(g).  As both the \nSupreme Court and our Court have explained, § 1252(g)’s bar on jurisdiction is \n“narrow[].” Reno v. Am.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, \n482 (1999); see also Fulton v. Noem, No. 25-194, at 2 (2d Cir. Apr. 30, 2025) (order \ngranting  stay  of  removal  pending  appeal  and  rejecting  the  proposition  that \n§ 1252(g) bars review of challenges to the manner of removal).  Section 1252(g) is \ndirected “against a particular evil: attempts to impose judicial constraints upon \nprosecutorial discretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9.  This bar on judicial review \nis thus cabined “to three discrete actions”: a decision “to ‘commence proceedings, \nadjudicate  cases,  or  execute  removal  orders.’”    Id.  at  482  (quoting  8  U.S.C. \n§ 1252(g)) (emphases adopted).  There are “many other decisions or actions that \n24 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 1P aogf e9 627 of 45\nmay be part of the deportation process” but that do not fall within the three \ndiscrete exercises of “prosecutorial discretion” covered by § 1252(g).  Id. at 482, \n489.  \nMost, if not all, of Öztürk’s habeas claims seem to fall outside of § 1252(g)’s \nnarrow jurisdictional bar.  She does not challenge the government’s decision to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate her case, or execute a removal order.  Instead, \nher petition challenges her unlawful detention, pending those proceedings, and \nshe seeks her release from detention in the interim based on the violations of her \nFirst and Fifth Amendment rights that she has identified.  Pet. at 22.6  Section \n1252(g) “does not preclude jurisdiction over the challenges to the legality of [a \nnoncitizen’s] detention.”  Kong v. United States, 62 F.4th 608, 609 (1st Cir. 2023); see \nalso Parra v. Perryman, 172 F.3d 954, 957 (7th Cir. 1999) (similar). \n \n6 Among other things, the petition’s Prayer for Relief requests “Respondents to \nreturn Petitioner to [the] District [of Vermont] pending these proceedings,” “Order \nthe immediate release of Petitioner pending these proceedings,” and “Declare that \nRespondents’ actions to arrest and detain Petitioner violate the First Amendment \nand the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.”  Pet. at 22.  At this time, the \nCourt need not decide whether every Prayer for Relief survives § 1252(g).  So long \nas part of her challenge to her detention falls outside § 1252(g), her petition \nsurvives.  The district court would on that basis alone retain the authority to order \nher transfer to aid its resolution of this case. \n25 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 2P aogf e9 628 of 45\nNevertheless, the government contends that Öztürk’s detention “aris[es] \nfrom” the commencement, adjudication, or execution of removal proceedings.  \nThis contention is likely mistaken.  The Supreme Court has already “rejected as \n‘implausible’ the Government’s suggestion that § 1252(g) covers ‘all claims arising \nfrom deportation proceedings’ or imposes ‘a general jurisdictional limitation.’”  \nDep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 19 (2020) \n(quoting AADC, 525 U.S. at 482); accord Jennings v.

(observing that \nthe Court “did not interpret [the phrase “arising from” in § 1252(g)] to sweep in \nany claim that can technically be said to ‘arise from’ the three listed actions of the \nAttorney General”).  Because “the phrase ‘arising from’ is not ‘infinitely elastic,’” \nit “does not reach ‘claims that are independent of, or wholly collateral to, the \nremoval process.’”  Kong, 62 F.4th at 614 (quoting Aguilar, 510 F.3d at 10–11); see \nalso Parra, 172 F.3d at 957 (similar).   \n“Among such ‘collateral’ claims” not subject to the § 1252(g) bar on judicial \nreview are “claims seeking review of the legality of a petitioner’s detention.”  Kong, \n62 F.4th at 614.

Her detention does not arise from the \ngovernment’s  “commence[ment  of]  proceedings.”    AADC,  525  U.S.  at  482 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Filing a Notice to Appear (“NTA”) in an immigration \ncourt is the action that commences removal proceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a); \n8 C.F.R. § 1239.1.  But ICE detained Öztürk before an NTA was filed with the \nimmigration court.   \nNor does her detention-related claim seem to arise from the decision to \nadjudicate her removal case, since her challenge to her detention has nothing to do \nwith whether a “removal action should be abandoned . . . or whether the formal \nadjudicatory process should proceed.”  Barahona-Gomez v. Reno, 236 F.3d 1115, \n1120 (9th Cir. 2001) (quotation marks omitted); see also Michalski v. Decker, 279 F. \n27 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 4P aogf e9 630 of 45\nSupp. 3d 487, 495 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (reasoning that “the decision or action to arrest \nor detain an alien [cannot] be fairly construed as a decision or action to ‘adjudicate \ncases’” because “the decision to detain an individual . . . does not implicate the \nExecutive’s discretion in continuing or withdrawing such a proceeding”).   \nFurther, the government confirmed that ICE’s decision to arrest and detain \nÖztürk was not directed by § 1226(a).  Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *10.  In other \nwords, her detention was not mandated by the mere fact that her case was under \nadjudication.  Nor could her detention possibly “arise from” the execution of a \nremoval  order,  because  no  such  order  has  been  entered.    Because  Öztürk’s \nunlawful detention claims “may be resolved without affecting pending [removal] \nproceedings,” they do not arise from the three discrete exercises of prosecutorial \ndiscretion that are shielded by § 1252(g).  Parra, 172 F.3d at 957; see also Madu v. \nU.S.  Att’y  Gen.,  470  F.3d  1362,  1368  (11th  Cir.  2006)  (challenge  to  unlawful \ndetention not barred by § 1252(g) because it was distinct from a challenge to the \ngovernment’s decision to execute a removal order). \nThe government nevertheless insists that the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAADC bars this claim under § 1252(g).  Again, it is unlikely to succeed on this \nargument.  It is true that the petitioners in AADC claimed that “INS was selectively \n28 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 5P aogf e9 631 of 45\nenforcing immigration laws against them in violation of their First and Fifth \nAmendment Rights.”  525 U.S. at 474.  And the Supreme Court indeed concluded \nthat the “challenge to the Attorney General’s decision to ‘commence proceedings’ \nagainst them [fell] squarely within § 1252(g).”  Id. at 487.  But the petitioners’ \nclaims in that case fell within that jurisdictional bar because they sought “to \nprevent  the  initiation  of  deportation  proceedings,”  id.  at  474—i.e.,  the \n“commence[ment of] proceedings,” id. at 482.  The habeas claims in that case did \nnot sound in unlawful detention at all, and it is therefore of no help to the \ngovernment.7 \nAccordingly, the government failed to satisfy its burden of demonstrating \nthat § 1252(g) likely strips the district court of jurisdiction to hear Öztürk’s petition.  \nThe district court retains jurisdiction over at least some of Öztürk’s claims, vesting \nit with the transfer authority it exercised. \nc.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5), 1252(b)(9), and 1226(e) \n \n7 In a string-cite, the government also references this Circuit’s decision in Ragbir v. \nHoman, 923 F.3d 53 (2d Cir. 2019), vacated sub nom. Pham v. Ragbir, 141 S. Ct. 227 \n(2020), to bolster its argument.  But similar to AADC, the petitioners in that case \n“sought to prevent the Government from executing [a] final order of removal \nagainst him.”  Id. at 61.  That is squarely the third of the exercises of prosecutorial \ndiscretion protected by § 1252(g).  The habeas petition in that case says nothing of \nunlawful detention. \n29 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 6P aogf e9 632 of 45\nFor similar reasons, the government’s argument that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5), \n1252(b)(9), and 1226(e) bar district court review of Öztürk’s detention-related \nclaims is unlikely to succeed.  Section 1252(b)(9) bars district court review of claims \n“arising from . . . action[s]” or “proceeding[s] brought to remove an alien.”  8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(9).  The government urges the conclusion that, because Öztürk’s \nconstitutional arguments under the First and Fifth Amendments relate to her \ndetention, and because detention itself is “necessary for . . . removal proceedings,” \n§ 1252(b)(9) strips district courts of jurisdiction.  Mot. at 18 (quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 513 (2003)).  In other words, the \ngovernment contends that the mere fact of Öztürk’s detention funnels all her \nunlawful  detention  claims  into  § 1252(b)(9),  irrespective  of  how  tangentially \nrelated the claims may be to removal proceedings.   \nAs a threshold matter, the very text of § 1252(b) sets out requirements only \n“[w]ith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).”  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b).  No such order of removal is at issue here.  In any event, the Supreme \nCourt has rejected the proposed approach, holding that “§ 1252(b)(9) does not \npresent a jurisdictional bar where those bringing suit are not asking for review of \nan  order  of  removal,  the  decision  to  seek  removal,  or  the  process  by  which \n30 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 7P aogf e9 633 of 45\nremovability will be determined.”  Regents, 591 U.S. at 19 (cleaned up) (quoting \nJennings, 583 U.S. at 294).   \nJennings does not require a different outcome, despite the government’s \ninsistence.  As a threshold matter, the discussion of § 1252(b)(9) in Jennings is not \npart of the plurality opinion of the Court.  See 583 U.S. at 292–96 (opinion of Alito, \nJ., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J.).  And in any event, the relevant part of \nJennings does not support the conclusion that § 1252(b)(9) bars jurisdiction over \nhabeas challenges to detention.  That section in fact rejected the government’s \n“expansive  interpretation  of  § 1252(b)(9).”    Id.  at  293;  see  also  id.  at  295  n.3.    \nContrary to the government’s position, the mere fact that a noncitizen is detained \ndoes not deprive district courts of jurisdiction under § 1252(b)(9):  “The question \nis not whether detention is an action taken to remove an alien but whether the \nlegal questions in this case arise from such an action.”  Id. at 295 n.3 (emphasis in \noriginal).   \nAs explained above, Öztürk’s unlawful detention claims may be resolved \nwithout affecting pending removal proceedings.  She asserts that the government \narrested and detained her to prevent speech with which it disagrees.  Such an act \nwould  be  a  violation  of  the  Constitution—quite  separate  from  the  removal \n31 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 5, 8P aogf e9 634 of 45\nprocedures followed by the immigration courts.  Consequently, even if her claims \nhave  a  relationship  to  “pending  removal  proceedings,”  her  claims  do  not \nthemselves challenge “removal proceedings” and thus § 1252(b)(9)’s “channeling \nfunction  has  no  role  to  play.”    Canal  A  Media  Holding,  LLC  v.

Jennings, 583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined \nby Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J.).

Here, \nÖztürk seeks release from detention.    \nThis distinction makes practical sense.  While challenges to removal can be \nheard in a petition for review after an order of removal has been entered by an \nimmigration judge and affirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals, the same \nis not true of constitutional challenges to detention like the ones raised by Öztürk.  \nFor one, neither the IJ nor the BIA has “jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.”  \nRabiu v. Immigr. & Naturalization Serv., 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d Cir. 1994); see also Hinds \nv. Lynch, 790 F.3d 259, 262 (1st Cir. 2015) (citing Matter of C-, 20 I. & N. Dec. 529, \n532 (BIA 1992)); Arriaga v. Mukasey, 521 F.3d 219, 222 (2d Cir. 2008) (same).  And \nwhile  the  court  of  appeals  considering  the  petition  for  review  may  consider \nconstitutional claims, that court is obliged to “decide the petition only on the \nadministrative  record  on  which  the  order  of  removal  is  based.”    8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(b)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  However, we are not persuaded that an IJ or \nthe BIA would have developed a sufficient factual record, or any record at all, with \nrespect to the challenged detention, especially seeing as bond hearings are decided \n34 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 1P aogf e9 637 of 45\nseparately, appealed separately, and contain separate records than the removal \nproceedings.

This  means  that  in \nmany, if not most, instances, courts of appeal would not have a sufficient record \nto assess the government’s conduct in cases such as this.   \nConstruing  an  independent  constitutional  challenge  to  detention  as \nnecessarily implying a challenge to removal would lead to what Jennings called an \n“absurd” result.  583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and \nKennedy, J.).  Öztürk’s core argument is that her free speech and due process rights \nare being violated, now.  Pet. ¶¶ 67–76.  To require her to sit on her challenge until \nshe receives a final order of removal would create the situation warned of in \nJennings:  Öztürk’s detention claim would be “effectively unreviewable” because, \n“[b]y the time a  final  order of  removal  [is]  eventually  entered,  the  allegedly \nexcessive detention would have already taken place.”  583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of \nAlito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, J.).  “And of course, it is possible \nthat no such order would ever be entered in a particular case, depriving that \n35 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 2P aogf e9 638 of 45\ndetainee of any meaningful chance for judicial review.”  Id.; see also Khalil v. Joyce, \nNo. 25-CV-01963, 2025 WL 1232369, at *30 (D.N.J. Apr. 29, 2025) (concluding that \n§ 1252(b)(9) does not bar the petitioner’s constitutional claims because “a period \nof delay while this case is pending before the immigration courts” is inconsistent \nwith Supreme Court precedent “that meaningful review of First Amendment \nclaims generally means rapid, prioritized review” (emphasis added)); Fort Wayne \nBooks, Inc. v. Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 55 (1989) (determining that “refusal to grant \nimmediate review of petitioner’s [First Amendment] claims ‘might seriously erode \nfederal policy’” (emphasis added)).  \nAccordingly, the government has not established that § 1252(b)(9) likely \nstrips the district court of jurisdiction to hear Öztürk’s petition.  For the same \nreasons, we are unpersuaded by the government’s argument that § 1252(a)(5) \nforecloses review of Öztürk’s petition.  Section 1252(a)(5) bars district court review \n“of an order of removal,” but no order of removal is at issue here.  8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(5).   \nTo the extent the government maintains, as it did before the district court, \nthat 8 U.S.C. § 1226(e) bars jurisdiction over Öztürk’s detention, this argument is \nalso unlikely to succeed.  Section 1226(e) provides that the Secretary of Homeland \n36 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 3P aogf e9 639 of 45\nSecurity’s “discretionary judgment” regarding, among other things, the decision \nto arrest and detain a noncitizen pending a decision on removal, “shall not be \nsubject to review.”  8 U.S.C. § 1226(e).  But because § 1226(e) “ contains no explicit \nprovision barring habeas review,” the Supreme Court has held that its “clear text” \ndoes not bar jurisdiction over a constitutional challenge to detention under § 1226.  \nDemore, 538 U.S. at 517.  Likewise, this Court has held that § 1226(e) does not \nforeclose jurisdiction over habeas petitions challenging detention pursuant to § \n1226(a).  Velasco Lopez v. Decker, 978 F.3d 842, 850 (2d Cir. 2020) (holding that \n§ 1226(e)  does  not  “limit  habeas  jurisdiction  over  constitutional  claims  or \nquestions of law” (quotation marks omitted)). \nB.  Irreparable Injury \nThe government argues that it suffers an irreparable injury “[a]ny time” it \nis “enjoined by a court [from] effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of \nits people.”  Mot. at 19 (quoting Maryland v. King, 567 U.S. 1301, 1303 (2012) \n(Roberts, C.J., in chambers)).  We are not persuaded by this overbroad argument.  \nFirst, the district court’s order to transfer Öztürk from immigration custody in \nLouisiana to immigration custody in Vermont in order to prepare for and attend \nher  bail  and  habeas  petition  hearing  does  not  enjoin  the  government  from \nenforcing or “effectuating” any duly enacted law.  In particular, Öztürk does not \n37 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 4P aogf e9 640 of 45\nseek to disrupt—and nothing prevents the government from continuing with—\nthe removal proceedings it has commenced.  The government asserts that it would \nface difficulties in arranging for Öztürk to appear for her immigration proceedings \nin Louisiana remotely.  Reply at 2.  But the government has not disputed that it is \nlegally  and  practically  possible  for  Öztürk  to  attend  removal  proceedings \nremotely.  8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(2)(A)(iv) (providing that removal proceedings may, \nin some circumstances, take place “through telephone conference”).In addition, \nmuch of the government’s irreparable harm argument seems to rely upon its less-\nthan-convincing  merits  arguments.    “[S]imply  showing  some  possibility  of \nirreparable injury” is insufficient.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (quotation marks omitted).  \nInstead, the government must “demonstrate that irreparable injury is likely in the \nabsence of” its requested relief.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008).   \nLastly, of course, if the government were to prevail on this appeal, Öztürk \nwould return to immigration custody in Louisiana.  For this and the above reasons, \nwe hold that the government has failed to show an irreparable injury.   \nC.  Balance of Equities \n  Finally, the balance of the equities decisively disfavors a stay.  Permitting \nÖztürk’s transfer will provide her ready access to legal and medical services, \n38 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 5P aogf e9 641 of 45\naddress concerns about the conditions of her confinement, and expedite resolution \nof this matter—all of which are required, as the court below noted, to proceed \nexpeditiously.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2243; Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *25.  At stake, too, \nis Öztürk’s ability to participate meaningfully in her habeas proceedings.  Inherent \nin the term “habeas corpus” is the notion that the government is required to \nproduce the detainee in order to allow the court to examine the legality of her \ndetention.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2243 (“[T]he person to whom the writ is directed shall \nbe required to produce at the hearing the body of the person detained.”); Johnson \nv. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 778 (1950) (“A basic consideration in habeas corpus \npractice is that the prisoner will be produced before the court.  This is the crux of \nthe statutory scheme established by the Congress; indeed, it is inherent in the very \nterm ‘habeas corpus.’”); see also Ozturk, 2025 WL 1145250, at *22 (finding Öztürk’s \ntransfer to Vermont “would allow the Court to conduct appropriate fact-finding,” \nand  would  “facilitate  her  ability  to  work  with  her  attorneys,  coordinate  the \nappearance  of  witnesses,  and  generally  present  her  habeas  claims”).    The \ngovernment’s  contention  that  allowing  Öztürk  to  participate  meaningfully  in \nthese proceedings “prioritizes the (improper) proceedings in Vermont over the \n(proper) proceedings in Louisiana” is a particularly weak argument.

Ct. Dkt. ECF. \nNo. 3 at 2).  The court in Massachusetts did so within an hour of Öztürk’s petition \nbeing filed in order “to preserve the status quo.”  Id.  Although not technically \nnon-compliant, despite this order, the government moved Öztürk from Vermont \nto Louisiana the next morning.  The district court in Vermont ordered Öztürk’s \ntransfer in part to effectuate the district court in Massachusetts’s order, returning \nÖztürk “to the status quo at the time of issuance” and in part “to ensure continued \nrespect for orders issued by Article III courts.”  Id. at *24.  Equity favors such a \ndetermination. \n  While the government raises the specter of “irreparable injury” from the \ntransfer order because it would—evidently—suffer “logi[sti]cal difficulty,” and \nbecause  “micromanag[ing]  how  the  Executive  Branch . . . transfers \naliens . . . would  severely  undermine  the  workability  of  [the  immigration] \nsystem,” Mot. at 20, we are unpersuaded.  Faced with such a conflict between the \ngovernment’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, \n40 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 7P aogf e9 643 of 45\nand the risk of substantial constitutional harm to Öztürk on the other, we have \nlittle difficulty concluding “that the balance of hardships tips decidedly” in her \nfavor.  Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, 808 (2d Cir. 1984).   \nIV.  MANDAMUS RELIEF  \nThe  government  asks  this  Court,  in  the  alternative,  to  issue  a  writ  of \nmandamus and hold that the district court lacked authority to order Öztürk’s \ntransfer.  “The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be invoked only in \nextraordinary situations.”  Kerr v. U. S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of California, 426 U.S. \n394, 402 (1976).  “We issue the writ only in exceptional circumstances amounting \nto a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of discretion.”  In re Roman Cath. \nDiocese of Albany, New York, Inc., 745 F.3d 30, 35 (2d Cir. 2014) (quotation marks \nomitted); see also Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 U.S. 367, 380 (2004).   \nHere, the government has shown no such exceptional circumstances.  The \nheart of the government’s argument is that the district court lacked jurisdiction.  \nThe argument runs the government head into the “general rule that appellate \ncourts  should  avoid  determining  jurisdictional  issues  on  a  petition  for \nmandamus.”  In re Ivy, 901 F.2d 7, 10 (2d Cir. 1990); see also Roche v. Evaporated Milk \nAss’n,  319  U.S.  21,  26  (1943)  (holding  that,  when  considering  a  petition  for \n41 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 8P aogf e9 644 of 45\nmandamus, “appellate courts are reluctant to interfere with the decision of a lower \ncourt on jurisdictional questions which it was competent to decide and which are \nreviewable in the regular course of appeal”).  We therefore decline to issue a writ \nof mandamus. \n*  *  * \nFor the reasons stated above, the government’s motion for a stay of the \ntransfer order requiring Öztürk’s transportation from immigration custody in \nLouisiana to immigration custody in the District of Vermont is DENIED.  The \ngovernment’s  request  for  a  writ  of  mandamus  is  also  DENIED.    The \nadministrative stay entered by this Court is hereby VACATED.  Recognizing both \nthat  the  district  court’s  original  transfer  deadline  has  passed,  along  with  the \npractical and legal consequences of our decision for the parties, the government is \nhereby ORDERED to comply with the district court’s transfer order within one \nweek of the date of this opinion.  Accordingly, the district court’s April 18, 2025 \nOrder is hereby amended as follows: “To support the Court’s resolution of these \nissues, the Court orders that Ms. Öztürk be physically transferred to ICE custody \nwithin the District of Vermont no later than May 14, 2025.”  The district court may \namend its hearing schedule as it deems necessary in light of this order. \n42 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-150/1189/,2 0052/50,7 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a7g1e.1 6, 9P aogf e9 645 of 45\nThe parties are directed to confer with the Clerk of Court to set a briefing \nschedule for the merits of the appeal. \n43 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,0 P oafg 9e6 1 of 27\n \n25-1113 \nMahdawi v.

PARKER, SUSAN L. CARNEY, and ALISON J. NATHAN, Circuit Judges: \nMohsen Mahdawi is an undergraduate student at Columbia University.  He \nis also a Lawful Permanent Resident who has lived in the United States for over a \ndecade and is in the process of applying to become a U.S. citizen.  When Mahdawi \nappeared  for  his  naturalization  interview  in  Vermont  on  April  14,  2025,  he \nanswered the government’s questions and passed his citizenship test.  But, he \nalleges, at the interview’s conclusion, a team of armed law enforcement officers \nentered  the  room  and  placed  him  under  arrest.    He  was  brought  to  a  U.S. \nCitizenship and Immigration Services office and was served with a Notice to \nAppear, which informed him that the U.S. Secretary of State had determined that \nhe was removable from the United States under the Immigration and Nationality \nAct.  Officers then brought him to the airport in Burlington, Vermont, with the \nintent to transport him to Louisiana, but after they missed the flight to Louisiana, \nofficers brought him to a detention center in Vermont.   \nThrough counsel, Mahdawi filed a habeas petition, challenging his arrest \nand detention and seeking his release.  He maintains that, in violation of his First \nand Fifth Amendment rights, he was arrested and detained in retaliation for his \npeaceful advocacy on the politically contentious topic of the war in Gaza.  On \nMahdawi’s emergency motion, the district court issued, and later extended, a \n1 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,3 P oafg 9e6 4 of 27\ntemporary restraining order prohibiting the government from removing Mahdawi \nfrom the District of Vermont.  Following a bail hearing, the court also granted \nMahdawi’s motion to be released during the pendency of his habeas proceeding, \nfinding that he was neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community—findings \nthat the government does not contest before this panel.   \nThe government now seeks an emergency stay of these orders.  Largely for \nthe reasons explained in our opinion in Öztürk v. Hyde, No. 25-1019, 2025 WL \n1318154 (2d Cir. May 7, 2025), we deny the motion for a stay.  As explained there, \nthe government is unlikely to succeed on its arguments that the district court \nlacked jurisdiction over Mahdawi’s habeas petition.  We further conclude that the \ngovernment is unlikely to succeed on its arguments that the district court lacked \nthe  authority  to  order  Mahdawi’s  release.    We  are  also  unpersuaded  by  the \ngovernment’s  argument  that  the  district  court’s  orders  prevented  it  from \neffectuating duly enacted law, thereby causing it to suffer irreparable injury.  In \nfact,  immigration  removal  proceedings  have  continued  in  Louisiana,  and \nMahdawi has attended them remotely since his release.  Finally, the balance of the \nequities tips in favor of denying the stay.  Indeed, the practical effect of the relief \nthe  government  seeks  would  be  Mahdawi’s  re-detention.    Individual  liberty \n2 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,4 P oafg 9e6 5 of 27\nsubstantially outweighs the government’s weak assertions of administrative and \nlogistical costs.  For these reasons, the government’s motion for a stay is DENIED \nand the government’s request for a writ of mandamus is also DENIED. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nThis  case  arises  from  the  arrest  and  detention  of  Mohsen  Mahdawi,  a \nPalestinian student who entered the United States in July 2014 and has been a \nLawful Permanent Resident since January 2015.  Mahdawi is an undergraduate at \nColumbia University, majoring in philosophy.  As a student at Columbia, he spoke \nout against Israel’s military response to the atrocities committed by Hamas on \nOctober 7, 2023.  He also took part in student demonstrations where he spoke \npublicly about “the importance of respecting international law, human rights, and \nthe need for a permanent ceasefire and a peaceful resolution.”  Mahdawi v. Trump, \nNo. 2:25-cv-389, 2025 WL 1243135, at *1 (D. Vt. Apr. 30, 2025) (quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 19-2 ¶ 15).  The government does not at \nthis time assert that his speech was not protected by the First Amendment. \nOn April 14, 2025, Mahdawi appeared for his naturalization interview in \nVermont.    Mot.  Ex.  A  (Habeas  Petition,  hereinafter  “Pet.”)  at  12  ¶ 50.  \nUnbeknownst to Mahdawi, a month earlier the Secretary of State had secretly \nissued a memorandum, ostensibly pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(4)(C), declaring \n3 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,5 P oafg 9e6 6 of 27\nhim  deportable  for  his  speech  and  associations,  which  the  memorandum \ndescribed as “otherwise lawful.”  Mot. Ex. B at 1.  At the end of his interview, he \nwas arrested by a team of masked ICE agents, brought to a U.S. Citizenship and \nImmigration Service office, and served with a Notice to Appear (“NTA”).  The \nNTA stated that Mahdawi was removable because “[t]he Secretary of State has \ndetermined that your presence and activities in the United States would have \nserious adverse foreign policy consequences and would compromise a compelling \nU.S. foreign policy interest.”  Mahdawi, 2025 WL 1243135, at *3 (quoting Dist. Ct. \nDkt. ECF No. 19-2, at 10, 13). \nThat same day, shortly before 2:00 p.m., the agents transported Mahdawi to \nthe airport in Burlington, Vermont, intending to transport him to a Louisiana jail.  \nThey missed their scheduled flight, and Mahdawi was moved first to the ICE field \noffice in St. Albans, Vermont, and then to the Northwest State Correctional Facility \nin Swanton, Vermont.   \nMahdawi’s attorney filed a habeas petition in the District of Vermont, which \nwas first assigned to Judge William K. Sessions III.  Among other things, his \npetition challenges “the government’s targeting and detention of Mr. Mahdawi,” \n4 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,6 P oafg 9e6 7 of 27\nand alleges that his “unlawful arrest and detention” was intended “to punish him \nfor his speech and to chill similar speech.”  Pet. at 2 ¶ 4, 15 ¶¶ 64–67, 16 ¶ 76.   \nShortly after his arrest on April 14, Judge Sessions granted Mahdawi’s \nemergency  motion  for  a  temporary  restraining  order  (“TRO”)  prohibiting \nMahdawi’s transfer to Louisiana or his removal from this country.  Mahdawi, No. \n2:25-cv-389, 2025 WL 1099021, at *1 (D. Vt. Apr. 14, 2025).  On April 24, following \nthe case’s reassignment to Judge Geoffrey W. Crawford, the court extended the \nTRO.  Mahdawi, No. 25-cv-389 (D. Vt. Apr. 24, 2025), Dist. Ct. Dkt. ECF No. 34.  \nDuring this time, Mahdawi remained detained at Northwest Correctional Facility.   \nMahdawi  applied  for  release  on  bail  pending  resolution  of  his  habeas \npetition.    On  April  30,  2025,  after  a  hearing,  Judge  Crawford  granted  the \napplication.  In a careful and well-reasoned opinion, the court concluded, among \nother things, that Mahdawi presented neither a flight risk nor a danger to his \ncommunity or to others.  Mahdawi, 2025 WL 1243135, at *12.  The government has \nyet to contest these findings. \nBefore us is the government’s emergency motion seeking a stay pending \nappeal of the district court’s order extending its initial TRO (April 24, 2025 Order) \nand its order of release on bail (April 30, 2025 Order).  The government asked for \n5 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,7 P oafg 9e6 8 of 27\nthis stay motion to be heard on an expedited schedule, and together with its stay \nmotion in Öztürk.  An applications judge granted these requests and denied the \nrequest for an administrative stay.  See 2d Cir. Dkt. ECF No. 30.1   \nII.  APPELLATE JURISDICTION \nAs  an  initial  matter,  and  as  Mahdawi  concedes,  we  have  appellate \njurisdiction to review each of the challenged orders.  First, under the “collateral \norder doctrine,” we have jurisdiction to review “‘a small class of’ interlocutory \nrulings that ‘are too important to be denied review and too independent of the \ncause itself to require that appellate consideration be deferred until the whole case \nis adjudicated.’”  Fischer v. New York State Dep’t of L., 812 F.3d 268, 273 (2d Cir. 2016) \n(quoting Will v. Hallock, 546 U.S. 345, 349 (2006)) (other internal citations omitted).  \nWe have previously held that an order granting bail pending disposition of a \nhabeas petition is an appealable collateral order.  Iuteri v. Nardoza, 662 F.2d 159, \n161 (2d Cir. 1981).   \nSecond, because the TRO lasts for up to 90 days and “carries many of the \nhallmarks  of  a  preliminary  injunction,”  we  construe  it  “as  an  appealable \npreliminary injunction.”  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 (2025); see \n \n1  The government also moved to consolidate the two cases.  We deny that \nmotion by separate order.   \n6 \n \n\nRESTR CICaTseE:D 2 5C-a1s1e1:3 2, 50-51/11183/2, 00255/0, 9D/2kt0E2n5t,r yD: k9t3E.n1t,r yP:a 8g6e. 17,8 P oafg 9e6 9 of 27\nalso Trump v. J. G. G., 145 S. Ct. 1003, 1005, 1006 (2025) (vacating a TRO that had \nenjoined the government from removing any of the individual plaintiffs from the \nUnited States for 14 days).  Accordingly, we conclude that both the district court’s \nrelease order and extended TRO are appealable orders.   \nIII.  STAY PENDING APPEAL \nA stay is “an exercise of judicial discretion,” and the “propriety of its issue \nis dependent upon the circumstances” presented to the court.  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 433 (2009) (quotation marks omitted).  “The party requesting a stay bears \nthe burden of showing that the circumstances justify an exercise of [the Court’s] \ndiscretion.”  Id. at 433–34.  The four stay factors are “(1) whether the stay applicant \nhas made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether \nthe applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the \nstay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and \n(4) where the public interest lies.”  Id. at 434 (quotation marks omitted).  “The first \ntwo factors . . . are the most critical.”  Id.  And where “the government is a party \nto the suit, the final two factors merge.”  New York v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., \n969 F.3d 42, 58–59 (2d Cir. 2020).  We deny the stay because the government has \nnot met its burden on any of these factors. \n7 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 7, 9P aogf e9 610 of 27\nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nThe government contends that several provisions of the Immigration and \nNational Act (“INA”) stripped the district court of jurisdiction in this case, and \nthat the district court accordingly lacked the power to order Mahdawi’s release \nand to extend the TRO.  These arguments are unlikely to succeed in no small part \nbecause  our  analysis  is  guided  by  longstanding  principles  of  statutory \ninterpretation requiring Congress to speak clearly and specifically when it wishes \nto deprive the federal courts of jurisdiction.  Repeatedly, including in the INA \ncontext, the Supreme Court has declared that we should “take account . . . of the \npresumption  favoring  interpretations  of  statutes  [to]  allow  judicial \nreview . . . absent clear statement.”  Kucana v. Holder, 558 U.S. 233, 237 (2010) \n(quotation marks and citation omitted); see also McNary v. Haitian Refugee Ctr., Inc., \n498 U.S. 479, 483–84 (1991).  “[O]nly upon a showing of clear and convincing \nevidence of a contrary legislative intent should the courts restrict access to judicial \nreview.”  Bowen v. Michigan Acad. of Fam. Physicians, 476 U.S. 667, 671 (1986) \n(quotation marks omitted).  As explained below, the provisions on which the \n8 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 0P aogf e9 611 of 27\ngovernment relies do not state, let alone clearly state, a jurisdictional bar on review \nof Mahdawi’s detention claims. \n1.  Release Order \nAt this stage, the government makes no challenge to the district court’s \nsubstantive determination that Mahdawi should be released on bail pending the \ndisposition  of  his  habeas  petition.    See  Mahdawi,  2025  WL  1243135,  at  *8–13.  \nInstead, it makes only jurisdictional challenges to the release order based on 8 \nU.S.C. §§ 1252(g), 1252(a)(5), and 1252(b)(9).  We conclude that these jurisdictional \nchallenges are unlikely to succeed. \na.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(g) \nWe begin with the government’s argument that the district court’s release \norder should be stayed on the ground that § 1252(g) strips the district court of \njurisdiction to hear Mahdawi’s habeas petition.  Section 1252(g) prohibits courts \nfrom “hear[ing] any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the \ndecision or action by the Attorney General [or Secretary of Homeland Security] to \ncommence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any \nalien  under this  chapter.”   8  U.S.C. §  1252(g).2    The  government  claims  that \n \n2  As  part  of  transferring  many  immigration-related  responsibilities  from  the \nAttorney General to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, “the \n \n9 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 1P aogf e9 612 of 27\nMahdawi’s  challenge  to  his  unlawful  detention  “aris[es]  from”  the \ncommencement of removal proceedings.  Mot. at 7 (quotation marks omitted). \nThe government dramatically overstates the reach of § 1252(g) and has \nfailed to demonstrate a likelihood of success on this claim.  As we said in Öztürk \nv. Hyde, § 1252(g) does not reach “claims that are  independent of, or wholly \ncollateral to, the removal process.”  No. 25-1019, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9 (2d Cir. \nMay 7, 2025) (quoting Kong v. United States, 62 F.4th 608, 614 (1st Cir. 2023)).  The \nSupreme Court and our Court have explained that § 1252(g)’s bar on jurisdiction \nis  “narrow[],”  and  “applies  only  to  three  discrete  actions”:  a  decision  “to \n‘commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders.’”  Reno v. \nAm.-Arab Anti-Discrimination Comm. (“AADC”), 525 U.S. 471, 482 (1999) (quoting 8 \nU.S.C. § 1252(g) (emphases adopted)); see also Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *8.  \nSection 1252(g) is thus “directed against a particular evil: attempts to impose \njudicial constraints upon prosecutorial discretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9.  But \nthere are “many other decisions or actions that may be part of the deportation \nprocess” and yet do not fall within the three discrete exercises of “prosecutorial \n \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 mandates that references to the Attorney General \nare deemed to include DHS where, as here, the relevant agency functions have \nbeen transferred from the Department of Justice to DHS.”  Shabaj v. Holder, 718 \nF.3d 48, 51 n.3 (2d Cir. 2013) (citing 6 U.S.C. § 557); see also 6 U.S.C. § 202. \n10 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 2P aogf e9 613 of 27\ndiscretion” covered by § 1252(g).  Id. at 482, 485 n.9; see also Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *8. \nFor  that  reason,  in  Öztürk,  we  concluded  that  a  petitioner’s  “claims  of \nunlawful and retaliatory detention” were “independent of, and collateral to, the \nremoval process.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9.  There, we explained that relief \nfrom the allegedly improper detention did not interfere with DHS’s “prosecutorial \ndiscretion.”  AADC, 525 U.S. at 485 n.9.  Nor did it interfere with DHS’s ability to \ninitiate removal proceedings against the petitioner, to adjudicate her removal case, \nor to execute any removal order.  See Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *9–10.  We \ntherefore held that her unlawful detention claims were collateral to the removal \nprocess and fell outside of § 1252(g)’s narrow jurisdictional bar.  Id. at *9. \nThe same is true here.  Mahdawi’s habeas petition challenges his detention \non the grounds that it violates his rights under the Constitution.3  As in Öztürk, \n \n3 Among other things, the petition's Prayer for Relief requests that the court “Order \nthe immediate release of Petitioner pending these proceedings,” “Order the release \nof  Petitioner,”  and  “Declare  that  Respondents’  actions  to  arrest  and  detain \nPetitioner violate the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.”  Pet. at 18.  At this time, the Court need not decide whether every \nsingle Prayer for Relief survives § 1252(g).  The district court is still considering \nthe  government’s  motion  to  dismiss  Mahdawi’s  petition  and  will  have  the \nopportunity to assess which claims are barred by § 1252(g) in the first instance.  So \nlong as part of his challenge to his detention falls outside of § 1252(g), his petition \nsurvives, as does the district court’s authority to order his release. \n11 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 3P aogf e9 614 of 27\nMahdawi’s “detention does not arise from the government’s ‘commenc[ement] of \nproceedings,’” which begins with the filing of an NTA in an immigration court.  \n2025 WL 1318154, at *9 (quoting AADC, 525 U.S. at 482); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1229(a); \n8 C.F.R. § 1239.1.  Nor do his claims “arise from the decision to adjudicate [his] \nremoval case,” since it does not “implicate the Executive’s discretion” to continue \nor withdraw such a proceeding.  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *10 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Moreover, the government does not claim that Mahdawi’s detention \nwas “mandated by the mere fact” that it commenced removal proceedings against \nhim.  Id.  To the contrary, the government “confirmed that ICE’s decision to arrest \nand detain [Mahdawi] was not directed by § 1226(a).”  Id.; see also Mot. at 20 (citing \n8 U.S.C. § 1226(a) as its “statutory basis for [Mahdawi’s] detention”).  And since \nno removal order has been entered, Mahdawi’s detention-related claims could not \n“possibly ‘arise from’ the execution of a removal order.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, \nat *10.  Mahdawi’s unlawful detention claims are thus likely “independent of, and \ncollateral to, the removal process.”  Id. at *9.   \nThe government nevertheless insists that the Supreme Court’s decision in \nAADC bars this claim.  It is unlikely to succeed on this argument, too.  It is true \nthat the petitioners in AADC claimed that the “INS was selectively enforcing \n12 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 4P aogf e9 615 of 27\nimmigration laws against them in violation of their First and Fifth Amendment \nrights.”  525 U.S. at 474.  And the Supreme Court indeed concluded that the \n“challenge to the Attorney General’s decision to ‘commence proceedings’ against \nthem [fell] squarely within § 1252(g).”  Id. at 487.  But the petitioners’ claims in that \ncase  fell  within  that  jurisdictional  bar  because  they  sought  “to  prevent  the \ninitiation of deportation proceedings,” id. at 474—i.e., the “commence[ment of] \nproceedings,” id. at 482.  The habeas claims in that case did not sound in unlawful \ndetention at all, and AADC is therefore of no help to the government. \nAccordingly,  the  government  has  failed  to  satisfy  its  burden  of \ndemonstrating that § 1252(g) likely strips the district court of jurisdiction to hear \nMahdawi’s petition.  \nb.  8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) and 1252(b)(9)  \nFor similar reasons, the government’s argument that 8 U.S.C. §§ 1252(a)(5) \nand (b)(9) bar district court review of Mahdawi’s claims is unlikely to succeed.  \nSection 1252(b)(9) bars district court review of claims “arising from . . . action[s]” \nor  “proceeding[s]  brought  to  remove  an  alien.”    8  U.S.C.  § 1252(b)(9).    The \ngovernment urges the conclusion that Mahdawi’s arrest and detention are a but-\nfor result of the Secretary of State’s determination that he was removable, and thus \n§ 1252(b)(9) strips district courts of jurisdiction.  Mot. at 15.  In other words, the \n13 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 5P aogf e9 616 of 27\ngovernment  contends  that  its  detention  of  Mahdawi  works  to  funnel  all  his \nunlawful detention claims into § 1252(b)(9), irrespective of how attenuated the \nclaims may be to removal proceedings.   \nAs we explained in Öztürk, we do not read § 1252(b) so broadly.  Öztürk, \n2025  WL  1318154,  at  *10–13.    First,  the  language  of  § 1252(b)  contradicts  the \ngovernment.  Id. at *11 (“[T]he very text of § 1252(b) sets out requirements only \nwith respect to review of an order of removal under subsection (a)(1).” (cleaned \nup) (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b))).  No order of removal is at issue here.  Second, the \nSupreme  Court  has  rejected  the  government’s  proposed  expansive  approach, \nholding  that  “§ 1252(b)(9)  does  not  present  a  jurisdictional  bar  where  those \nbringing suit are not asking for review of an order of removal, the decision to seek \nremoval, or the process by which removability will be determined.”  Dep’t of \nHomeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of California, 591 U.S. 1, 19 (2020) (cleaned up) \n(quoting Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 294 (2018)).   \nAs explained above, Mahdawi’s unlawful detention claims may be resolved \nwithout affecting pending removal proceedings.  He asserts that the government \narrested him to punish speech with which it disagrees.  But doing so would violate \nthe Constitution—quite separate from the removal procedures followed by the \n14 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 6P aogf e9 617 of 27\nimmigration courts.  Consequently, even if his claims have a substantive overlap \nwith challenges he may bring in his removal proceedings, his detention claims do \nnot themselves challenge or arise from “removal proceedings,” and “§ 1252(b)(9)’s \nchanneling  function  has  no  role  to  play.”    Öztürk,  2025  WL  1318154,  at  *11 \n(quotation marks omitted).  As we noted in Öztürk, legislative history from the \nREAL ID Act further supports this conclusion.  H.R. Rep. No. 109–72, at 175 (2005) \n(Conf. Rep.), as reprinted in 2005 U.S.C.C.A.N. 240, 300 (specifying that jurisdiction-\nstripping  provisions  “would  not  preclude  habeas  review  over  challenges  to \ndetention that are independent of challenges to removal orders”).   \nThis  distinction  between  detention  and  removal  makes  practical \nsense.  While challenges to removal can be heard in a petition for review after an \norder of removal has been entered by an immigration judge and affirmed by the \nBoard of Immigration Appeals, the same is not true of constitutional challenges to \ndetention like those raised by Mahdawi.  As we explained in Öztürk, “neither the \nIJ nor the BIA has ‘jurisdiction to decide constitutional issues.’”  Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *12 (quoting Rabiu v. Immigr. & Naturalization Serv., 41 F.3d 879, 882 (2d \nCir. 1994)).  And while the court of appeals considering the petition for review \nmay consider constitutional claims, that court is obliged to “decide the petition \n15 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 7P aogf e9 618 of 27\nonly  on  the  administrative  record  on  which  the  order  of  removal  is  based.”  \n8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (emphasis added).  We are not persuaded that an IJ or the \nBIA will develop a sufficient factual record, or any record at all, with respect to the \nchallenged detention, especially given that bond hearings are decided separately, \nappealed separately, and contain records separate from those made in the removal \nproceedings.  See 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a); 8 C.F.R. §§ 236.1(d), 1003.19(d); U.S. Dep’t \nJust., Exec. Off. for Immigr. Rev., Immigration Court Practice Manual, § 9.3(e), (f) \n(last  visited  May  6,  2025),  available  at  https://www.justice.gov/eoir/reference-\nmaterials/ic/chapter-9/3  [https://perma.cc/9A6W-AG9U].    This  means  that  in \nmany, if not most, instances, courts of appeal would not have a sufficient record \nto assess the constitutionality of the government’s conduct in cases such as this.   \nConstruing  an  independent  constitutional  challenge  to  detention  as \nnecessarily implying a challenge to removal would lead to what Jennings called an \n“absurd” result.  583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and \nKennedy, J.).  Mahdawi’s core argument is that his free speech and due process \nrights are being violated, now.  Pet. at 15–16, ¶¶ 63–76; see also Öztürk, 2025 WL \n1318154, at *12.  “By the time a final order of removal [is] eventually entered”—if \nit ever is entered—the allegedly wrongful detention will have already occurred.  \n16 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 8P aogf e9 619 of 27\nJennings, 583 U.S. at 293 (opinion of Alito, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Kennedy, \nJ.). \nAccordingly, the government has not established that § 1252(b)(9) likely \nstrips the district court of jurisdiction to hear Mahdawi’s petition.  For the same \nreasons, we reject the government’s argument that § 1252(a)(5) likely forecloses \nreview of Mahdawi’s petition.  Section 1252(a)(5) bars district court review “of an \norder of removal,” but no order of removal is at issue here.  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(5).   \n2.  TRO Extension Order \nThe government also asserts that the INA deprived the district court of \njurisdiction to extend its TRO.  As a preliminary matter, the government conceded \nat argument that if the release order remains in place, its challenge to the TRO is \n“essentially moot.”  Oral Arg. Hearing at 23:40–24:09.  But in any event, the \ngovernment is unlikely to prevail.  As in Öztürk, the government relies on 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), which precludes the exercise of federal court jurisdiction “to \nreview . . . any . . . decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of \nHomeland Security the authority for which is specified under this subchapter to \nbe  in  the  discretion  of  the  Attorney  General  or  the  Secretary  of  Homeland \nSecurity.”  8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  Here, the government \ncontends that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii) deprived the district court of jurisdiction to extend \n17 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 8, 9P aogf e9 620 of 27\nthe TRO on the ground that the decision where to detain a noncitizen pending \nremoval proceedings is committed to the discretion of the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, and the INA precludes judicial review over such discretionary decisions.  \nSee Mot. at 17–19.  \nBut as we explained in Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *7–8, the government \ndramatically overstates the scope of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  Section 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s \nbar on jurisdiction applies only to those decisions where Congress has expressly \n“set out the Attorney General’s discretionary authority in the statute.”  Kucana, 558 \nU.S. at 247.  Crucially, the question is not whether § 1231(g) “require[s] an exercise \nof  discretion”  because  even  if  it  “probably  do[es],” the  crux  is  “whether  the \ntext . . . specifies that the decision is in the discretion of the Attorney General.”  \nNethagani v. Mukasey, 532 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir. 2008) (cleaned up).  We have held \nthat “when a statute authorizes the Attorney General to make a determination, but \nlacks additional language specifically rendering that determination to be within \nhis discretion (e.g., ‘in the discretion of the Attorney General,’ ‘to the satisfaction \nof the Attorney General,’ etc.), the decision is not one that is ‘specified . . . to be in \n18 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 0P aogf e9 621 of 27\nthe discretion of the Attorney General’ for purposes of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Id. at \n154–55. \nThe government argues that two different statutory provisions, 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1231(g) and 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), “specif[y]” that the decision to detain immigrants \nin  the  custodial  location  of  the  government’s  choice  is  within  the  executive \nbranch’s  exclusive  discretion,  precluding  judicial  review.    The  government  is \nunlikely to prevail on this argument.  Section 1231(g) has no such additional \nlanguage.    It  merely  states  that  “[t]he  Attorney  General  shall  arrange  for \nappropriate places of detention for aliens detained pending removal or a decision \non removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  Far from authorizing discretion, § 1231(g) uses \nthe obligatory “shall” rather than the permissive “may.”  This language is “in stark \ncontrast to other sections of the INA,” which both use permissive verbs and \ninclude additional language specifying that those decisions that are within the \nAttorney General or DHS Secretary’s discretion.  Aguilar v. U.S. Immigr. & Customs \nEnf’t Div. of Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 510 F.3d 1, 20 (1st Cir. 2007); cf., e.g., 8 U.S.C. \n§ 1157(c)(1) (“[T]he Attorney General may, in the Attorney General’s discretion . . . .” \n(emphasis added)).  When “Congress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed \n19 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 1P aogf e9 622 of 27\nthat  Congress  acts  intentionally  and  purposely  in  the  disparate  inclusion  or \nexclusion.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 430 (quoting I.N.S. v. Cardoza–Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, \n432 (1987)).4 \nSection 1226(a), which states that “an alien may be arrested and detained \npending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States,” \nsimilarly falls outside the scope of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).  8 U.S.C. § 1226(a).  First, the \npermissive “may” in § 1226(a)  provides discretion only as to the decision to \ndetain—not as to the location of detention.  But even if this section did “authorize[] \nthe Attorney General” to detain an alien wherever they saw fit, it “lacks additional \nlanguage specifically rendering that determination to be within his discretion \n(e.g., ‘in the discretion of the Attorney General,’ ‘to the satisfaction of the Attorney \nGeneral,’ etc.).”  Nethagani, 532 F.3d at 154–55.  Accordingly, such a decision does \n \n4 In fact, the very next sentence of § 1231(g)(1) uses the permissive “may,” and the \nsubsection appears to relate “more centrally to the government’s brick and mortar \nobligations for obtaining facilities in which to detain aliens.”  Reyna as next friend \nof J.F.G. v. Hott, 921 F.3d 204, 209 (4th Cir. 2019).  Section 1231(g) first provides that \nthe Attorney General “shall arrange for appropriate places of detention for aliens \ndetained pending removal or a decision on removal.”  8 U.S.C. § 1231(g)(1).  If such \nfacilities “are unavailable,” the statute then provides that “the Attorney General \nmay expend” from specified appropriations “amounts necessary to acquire land \nand to acquire, build, remodel, repair, and operate facilities (including living \nquarters  for  immigration  officers  if  not  otherwise  available)  necessary  for \ndetention.”  Id. (emphasis added). \n20 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 2P aogf e9 623 of 27\nnot preclude judicial review because it “is not one that is ‘specified . . . to be in the \ndiscretion of the Attorney General’ for purposes of § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).”  Id. at 155. \nThe Supreme Court has applied the “presumption favoring interpretations \nof  statutes  [to]  allow  judicial  review . . . absent  clear  statement”  to \n§ 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)’s bar on jurisdiction.  Kucana, 558 U.S. at 237 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Under these circumstances, we do not believe that § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), by \noperation of § 1231(g) and § 1226(a), likely forecloses judicial review. \nAccordingly, we conclude that the government is unlikely to succeed in its \nappeal of the order releasing Mahdawi and the order extending the TRO. \nB.  Irreparable Injury \nAs in Öztürk, the government contends that any court order related to \nimmigration detention matters causes irreparable injury to its sovereign authority.  \nBut the government has not demonstrated in what way it is being “enjoined by a \ncourt [from] effectuating statutes enacted by representatives of its people.”  Mot. \nat  19  (quoting  Maryland  v.  King,  567  U.S.  1301,  1303  (2012)  (Roberts,  C.J.,  in \nchambers)).  The district court’s order to hold Mahdawi (if detained) in Vermont \npending  his  habeas  petition  hearing  does  not  enjoin  the  government  from \nenforcing or “effectuating” any duly enacted law.  The district court concluded \nthat Mahdawi is neither a flight risk nor a danger to the community, and the \n21 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 3P aogf e9 624 of 27\ngovernment does not challenge that determination.  Further, Mahdawi’s challenge \nto his detention does not seek to disrupt—and nothing prevents the government \nfrom continuing with—the removal proceedings it has commenced.  See 8 U.S.C. § \n1229a(b)(2)(A)(iii)–(iv)  (providing  that  removal  proceedings  may  take  place \nthrough  video  conference  or,  in  some  circumstances,  “through  telephone \nconference”).    We  thus  conclude  that  the  government  has  not  shown  any \nirreparable injury from either his release on bail or continued presence in the \nDistrict of Vermont pending his removal proceedings.   \nC.  Balance of Equities \n  Finally, the balance of the equities weighs heavily against a stay.  First of all, \nthe practical effect of the relief the government seeks would be to allow Mahdawi’s \nre-detention.  And “[t]he interest of the habeas petitioner in release pending appeal \n[is] always substantial.”  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 777 (1987).  This is \nespecially true given Mahdawi’s substantial First Amendment claims.  See Elrod v. \nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (“The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.”).  And as \nto the TRO, inherent in the term “habeas corpus” is the notion that the government \nis required to produce the detainee in order to allow the court to examine the \nlegality of detention.  See 28 U.S.C. § 2243 (“[T]he person to whom the writ is \n22 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 4P aogf e9 625 of 27\ndirected  shall  be  required  to  produce  at  the  hearing  the  body  of  the  person \ndetained.”); Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 778 (1950) (“A basic consideration \nin habeas corpus practice is that the prisoner will be produced before the court.  \nThis is the crux of the statutory scheme established by the Congress; indeed, it is \ninherent in the very term ‘habeas corpus.’”).  \n  For its part, the government does not contest the district court’s findings \nthat Mahdawi is neither a danger to the public nor a flight risk.  Instead, it claims \nirreparable harm from the “practical cost[]” of “creat[ing] an ad-hoc location for \nMahdawi  to  continue  to  appear  for  his  removal  proceedings  in  Louisiana \nremotely.”  Mot. at 19–20.  We are unpersuaded.  For one, Mahdawi is not in ICE \ndetention, so his appearing remotely is his responsibility, not the government’s.  \nBut  even  if  he  were  re-detained,  “[f]aced  with  such  a  conflict  between  the \ngovernment’s unspecific financial and administrative concerns on the one hand, \nand the risk of substantial constitutional harm to [Mahdawi] on the other, we have \nlittle difficulty concluding ‘that the balance of hardships tips decidedly’ in [his] \nfavor.”  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *14 (quoting Mitchell v. Cuomo, 748 F.2d 804, \n808 (2d Cir. 1984) (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \n23 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 5P aogf e9 626 of 27\nIV.  MANDAMUS RELIEF  \nThe  government  asks  this  Court,  in  the  alternative,  to  issue  a  writ  of \nmandamus and hold that the district court lacked authority to order Mahdawi’s \nrelease and extend the TRO.  “The remedy of mandamus is a drastic one, to be \ninvoked only in extraordinary situations.”  Kerr v. U. S. Dist. Ct. for N. Dist. of \nCalifornia,  426  U.S.  394,  402  (1976).    “We  issue  the  writ  only  in  exceptional \ncircumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power or a clear abuse of \ndiscretion.”  In re Roman Cath. Diocese of Albany, New York, Inc., 745 F.3d 30, 35 (2d \nCir. 2014) (quotation marks omitted); see also Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for D.C., 542 \nU.S.  367,  380  (2004).    The  government  has  shown  no  such  exceptional \ncircumstances.  Öztürk, 2025 WL 1318154, at *14 (denying writ of mandamus \nbecause “the government’s argument . . . that the district court lacked jurisdiction \n. . . runs the government head into the ‘general rule that appellate courts should \navoid determining jurisdictional issues on a petition for mandamus’” (quoting In \nre Ivy, 901 F.2d 7, 10 (2d Cir. 1990))).  We therefore decline to issue a writ of \nmandamus. \n*  *  * \n24 \n \n\nRESTR ICCaTsEeD: 2 C5a-1s1e1: 32,5 0-151/1183/,2 0052/50,9 D/2k0tE25n,t rDy:k 9tE3n.1tr,y P: a8g6e.1 9, 6P aogf e9 627 of 27\nFor the reasons stated above, the government’s motion for a stay of the \ndistrict court’s release order and extended TRO is DENIED.  The government’s \nrequest for a writ of mandamus is also DENIED. \nThe parties are directed to confer with the Clerk of Court to set a briefing \nschedule for the merits of the appeal. \n25 \n ",
