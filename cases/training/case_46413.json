This case challenged these tariffs.</p>\r\n<p>On April 16, 2025, the State of California and Governor Gavin Newsom, represented by the State Attorney General, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, and DHS's component agency, U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The plaintiffs argued that President Trump&rsquo;s executive orders imposing tariffs under IEEPA exceeded the authority granted by the statute. Given the serious consequences of imposing tariffs, the plaintiffs insisted that Congress should have explicitly authorized the president to take such unilateral actions; without such explicit authorization, the plaintiffs argued that the executive orders violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs requested a declaration that the Executive Orders imposing the tariffs were unlawful, an injunction against the implementation or enforcement of the orders, and court costs. The case was assigned to District Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 17, 2025, the defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing that the court had exclusive jurisdiction over trade matters. On May 13, the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a preliminary injunction, claiming that California would face irreparable harm if the tariffs stayed in effect. A hearing on the defendants' motion to transfer the case took place on May 27.</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, 2025, the court issued an order denying the defendants' motion to transfer the case and a judgment dismissing the case. The court found that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction over a case if it \"arises out of a United States law providing for tariffs.\" Here, the case arose out of a United States law (the Executive Order) creating tariffs, so the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction. However, the plaintiffs requested the court to dismiss, rather than transfer, the case, which the court did \"to allow California to pursue a prompt appeal of the jurisdictional question\" in the Ninth Circuit. 2025 WL 1569334.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 2, the plaintiffs appealed to the Ninth Circuit and filed a motion to expedite the case on June 4. The Court of Appeals scheduled oral argument in the case for September 17.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, defendants filed a Motion to Stay proceedings pending the Supreme Court of the United States&rsquo; resolution of two related cases: <a href=\"../../../../case/46396/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump</a> and <a href=\"../../../../case/46478/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump</a>. On September 12, the court granted the stay.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

On April 16, 2025, California and Governor Gavin Newsom, through the State Attorney General, sued President Trump, the Department of Homeland Security, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.

California asked the court to declare the tariffs illegal, stop their enforcement, and award court costs.\r\n\r\nDefendants asked the court to move the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) on April 17, saying that court handles all tariff cases. California asked the court to block the tariffs on May 13. On June 2, the court denied the transfer and dismissed the case, saying the CIT has exclusive authority over tariff cases but allowing California to appeal quickly. California appealed to the Ninth Circuit that same day and requested faster review. Oral argument was scheduled for September 17.\r\n\r\nOn September 10, defendants asked the court to pause the case while the Supreme Court decides V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v.

No. 9 \nDONALD J. TRUMP, et al., \n10 \nDefendants. \n11 \n   \n12   \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Beginning February 1, 2025, President Trump issued a series of executive orders imposing, \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  pausing, and modifying tariffs.  On April 16, 2025, the State of California—by and through \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  Attorney General Rob Bonta—and Gavin Newsom (together “California”) sued the President and \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  several federal agencies (together, “the Government”) to enjoin the tariffs and declare them \nS d nr\nee 17  unlawful.  (Dkt. No. 1.)  California contends the tariffs are ultra vires because the International \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Economic Emergency Powers Act (“IEEPA”), which President Trump invokes as statutory \n19  authority, does not authorize the tariffs imposed.  And California contends the President violated \n20  the separation-of-powers doctrine by usurping the power vested in Congress “[t]o lay and collect \n21  Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8.    \n22  Pending before the Court is the Government’s motion to transfer this case to the U.S. Court \n23  of International Trade (“CIT”).  The question before the Court is not whether the challenged tariffs \n24  are constitutional; instead, the question is whether this action arises out of a law providing for \n25  tariffs such that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction to decide whether the President was authorized \n26  to impose tariffs in the manner, and under the circumstances, in which he has.  See 28 U.S.C. § \n27  1581(i).  Having carefully considered the parties’ submissions, and with the benefit of oral \n28  argument on May 22, 2025, the Court concludes this action falls within the CIT’s exclusive \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 2 of 14\n \n1  jurisdiction.  Because this lawsuit arises out of executive orders imposing tariffs, and because \n2  those executive orders are “provisions of law for all purposes,” 19 U.S.C. § 3004(c), this action \n3  arises out of laws providing for tariffs and this Court is divested of jurisdiction.  Because \n4  California requests dismissal rather than transfer to the CIT, transfer is not in the interest of \n5  justice.  So, the Court DENIES the motion to transfer and DISMISSES the case without prejudice.   \n6  BACKGROUND \n7  I.  THE TARRIF EXECUTIVE ORDERS  \n8  A.  Country-Specific Tariffs \n9  On January 20, 2025, President Trump “declare[d] that a national emergency exists at the \n10  southern border of the United States.”  Proclamation No. 10,866, Declaring a National Emergency \n11  at the Southern Border of the United States, 90 Fed. Reg. 8327 (Jan. 29, 2025) (“Southern Border \n12  Proclamation”).  Finding the southern border “overrun by cartels, criminal gangs, known \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  terrorists, human traffickers, smugglers, unvetted military-age males from foreign adversaries, and \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  illicit narcotics that harm Americans,” the President found it “necessary for the Armed Forces to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  take all appropriate action to assist the Department of Homeland Security in obtaining full \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  operational control of the southern border.”  Id.   \nS d nr\nee 17  On February 1, 2025, the President—citing this Southern Border Proclamation—issued \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  three executive orders imposing tariffs on imports from Mexico, Canada, and China.  See Exec. \n19  Order No. 14,194, Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. \n20  9117 (Feb. 7, 2025) (imposing a 25% tariff on products from Mexico); Exec. Order No. 14,193, \n21  Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Drugs Across our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9113 \n22  (Feb. 7, 2025) (imposing a 25% tariff on products of Canada, with the exception of energy \n23  resources, subject to a 10% tariff); Exec. Order No. 14,195, Imposing Duties to Address the \n24  Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 9121 (Feb. 7, \n25  2025) (imposing a 10% tariff on products of the People’s Republic of China).   \n26  Each executive order “expand[ed] the scope of the national emergency declared” in the \n27  Southern Border Proclamation.  90 Fed. Reg. at 9118.  That is, the executive order imposing tariffs \n28  on Mexico expanded the Proclamation’s scope “to cover the failure of Mexico to arrest, seize, \n2 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 3 of 14\n \n1  detain, or otherwise intercept [drug trafficking organizations], other drug and human traffickers, \n2  criminals at large, and illicit drugs.”  Id.  The executive order imposing tariffs on Canada \n3  expanded the Proclamation’s scope to cover the threat posed by Canada’s failure “to do more to \n4  arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept [drug trafficking organizations], other drug and human \n5  traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 9114.  And the executive order \n6  imposing tariffs on China expanded the Proclamation’s scope “to cover the failure of the PRC \n7  government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money \n8  launderers, other [transnational criminal organizations], criminals at large, and drugs.”  90 Fed. \n9  Reg. at 9122.   \n10  In each executive order, the President invokes IEEPA as the source of authority: \n \n11  I have decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on \narticles that are products of Mexico as set forth in this order. In doing \na  12  so, I invoke my authority under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA, and \ntr in specifically find that action under other authority to impose tariffs is \nuoro 13  inadequate to address this unusual and extraordinary threat. \nCfi\n tla  \ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo 90 Fed. Reg. at 9118; 90 Fed. Reg. at 9114 (same); 90 Fed. Reg. at 9122 (same).  And each \niD tc 15 \n sir executive order instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to “determine the modifications \net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr necessary to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) in order to effectuate \nee 17 \nth\nintr this order consistent with law and shall make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in \nUo\nN 18 \nthe Federal Register.”  90 Fed. Reg. at 9118; see also id. at 9115 (same); id. at 9123 (same).        \n19 \n  The President has since issued numerous executive orders pausing the tariffs, exempting \n20 \ncertain goods, and adjusting tariff rates.  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14,198, Progress on the \n21 \nSituation at Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 26 (Feb. 10, 2025 (“In recognition of the steps \n22 \ntaken by the Government of Mexico, and in order to assess whether the threat described in section \n23 \n1 of this order has abated, the additional 25 percent ad valorem rate of duty shall be paused and \n24 \nwill not take effect until March 4, 2025.”); Exec. Order No. 14,231, Amendment to Duties To \n25 \nAddress the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 46 (Mar. 11, 2025)  \n26 \n(“In order to minimize disruption to the United States automotive industry and automotive \n27 \nworkers, it is appropriate to adjust tariffs imposed on articles of Canada in Executive Order 14193 \n28 \n3 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 4 of 14\n \n1  of February 1, 2025.”); Exec. Order No. 14,228, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the \n2  Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China (Mar. 7, 2025) (“In recognition \n3  of the fact that the PRC has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis, section 2(a) \n4  of Executive Order 14195 is hereby amended by striking the words ‘10 percent’ and inserting in \n5  lieu thereof the words ‘20 percent.’”).   \n6  B.  Universal and Reciprocal Tariffs   \n7  On April 2, 2025, the President issued an executive order imposing a 10% tariff on “all \n8  imports from all trading partners,” with some exceptions.  Exec. Order No. 14,257, Regulating \n9  Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and \n10  Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15041 (Apr. 7, 2025).  For \n11  certain enumerated countries, the executive order sets tariff rates to increase to a specified rate, \n12  ranging from 11% to 50%.  Id. at 15049-50. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13   The executive order simultaneously declares a national emergency, stating: \nCfi\n tla  \nciC 14  I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, \nrts fo find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our \niD tc 15  bilateral  trade  relationships,  disparate  tariff  rates  and  non-tariff \n sir\net barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress \ntatsiD 16  domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent \nS d nr annual  U.S.  goods  trade  deficits,  constitute  an  unusual  and \nee 17  extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the \nth\nintr United States. That threat has its source in whole or substantial part \nUo\nN 18  outside the United States in the domestic economic policies of key \ntrading  partners  and  structural  imbalances  in  the  global  trading \n19  system. I hereby declare a national emergency with respect to this \nthreat.    \n20   \n21  Id. at 15041.  This executive order, like the executive orders described above, cites IEEPA as the \n22  source of authority.  Id. (“By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the \n23  laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers \n24  Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.)(IEEPA) . . . .”).  And the order explicitly modifies the Harmonized \n25  Tariff Schedule of the United States, stating, for example, that “subchapter III of chapter 99 of the \n26  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) is modified by inserting the following \n27  new headings in numerical sequence, with the material in the new heading inserted in the columns \n28  of the HTSUS . . . .”  90 Fed. Reg. at 15090. \n4 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 5 of 14\n \n1    The President has since issued executive orders pausing and modifying some of the tariffs.  \n2  See, e.g., Exec. Order No. 14,226, Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner \n3  Retaliation and Alignment, 90 Fed. Reg. 15625, 15626 (Apr. 15, 2025) (“I have determined that it \n4  is necessary and appropriate to address the national emergency declared . . . by modifying the \n5  HTSUS to temporarily suspend, for a period of 90 days, except with respect to the PRC, \n6  application of” specified tariffs imposed on foreign trading partners).    \n7  II.  THE PRESENT SUIT \n8  California sued “to block the tariffs imposed by President Trump pursuant to IEEPA \n9  because they are not authorized by that statute.”  (Dkt. No. 1 ¶ 12.)1  The complaint alleges the \n10  “tariffs imposed as of April 2, 2025, are projected to shrink the U.S. economy by $100 billion \n11  annually, increase inflation by 1.3%, and cost the average American family $2,100.”  (Id. ¶ 68.)  \n12  “California, as a leader in global trade, bears an inordinate share of these costs.”  (Id. ¶ 69.)  For \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  example, “California’s ports process one-third of all exports and 40% of all containerized imports \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  for the entire world, generating an estimated $9 billion in state and local tax revenue annually.”  \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  (Id. ¶¶ 117, 126.)  The tariffs, “if left in place . . . will undoubtedly cause decreased activity at the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  ports, resulting in untold consequences for the hundreds of thousands of Californians who work \nS d nr\nee 17  there” and impact “the State’s tax revenue, which relies on money from the ports to fund various \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  programs.”  (Id. ¶ 127.) \n19  California brings two causes of action.  Count I alleges ultra vires conduct in excess of \n20  statutory authority.  (Id. ¶¶ 140-41.)  Count II alleges a violation of the separation-of-powers \n21  doctrine on the ground “[t]he Constitution provides that ‘Congress shall have the Power To lay \n22  and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises . . . .’”  (Id. ¶ 147 (quoting U.S. Const. art. I, § 8).)  \n23  California seeks a declaration “that President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders are unlawful and void, \n24  because they were issued ultra vires in excess of statutory authority and/or because they are \n25  unconstitutional and violate separation of powers.”  (Id. at 22.)  And California seeks to enjoin the \n26  agency defendants (Secretary Noem, DHS, Acting Commissioner Flores, and CBP) “from taking \n27 \n \n1 Record citations are to material in the Electronic Case File (“ECF”); pinpoint citations are to the \n28 \nECF-generated page numbers at the top of the documents.   \n5 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 6 of 14\n \n1  any action to implement or enforce President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders.”  (Id.)   \n2  The Government moves to transfer this case to the CIT on the ground the CIT has \n3  exclusive jurisdiction over California’s claims under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i).  \n4  DISCUSSION \n5  A federal statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1581, provides for the CIT’s exclusive jurisdiction of certain \n6  civil actions:  \n \n7  [T]he Court of International Trade shall have exclusive jurisdiction of \nany civil action commenced against the United States, its agencies, or \n8  its  officers,  that  arises  out  of  any  law  of  the  United  States \nproviding for— \n9   \n(A) revenue from imports or tonnage; \n10   \n(B) tariffs,  duties,  fees,  or  other  taxes  on  the  importation  of \n11  merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenue; \n \na  12  (C) embargoes or other quantitative restrictions on the importation of \ntr in merchandise for reasons other than the protection of the public health \nuoro 13  or safety; or \nCfi\n tla  \nciC 14  (D) administration and enforcement with respect to the matters \nrts fo referred to in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph and \niD tc 15  subsections (a)-(h) of this section. \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) (emphasis added).  So, if this lawsuit “arises out of” a United States law \nS d nr\nee 17  “providing for” tariffs, or the “administration and enforcement” of tariffs, it belongs in the CIT.  \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  I.  THE ACTION ARISES OUT OF A LAW OF THE UNITED STATES \n19  This action arises out of President Trump’s executive orders imposing tariffs.  That is, the \n20  lawsuit challenging President Trump’s imposition of tariffs originates from, grows out of, and \n21  flows from the executive orders through which the President imposed tariffs.  See In re Border \n22  Infrastructure Env’t Litig., 915 F.3d 1213, 1220 (9th Cir. 2019) (noting “arising out of” is \n23  “ordinarily understood to mean ‘originating from,’ ‘having its origin in,’ ‘growing out of’ or \n24  ‘flowing from’ or in short, ‘incident to, or having connection with’”).  Those executive orders are \n25  laws of the United States.  They modify, or instruct the Department of Homeland Security to \n26  modify, the Harmonized Tariff Schedule, which is a statutory provision.  19 U.S.C. § \n27  3004(c)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the modifications themselves are statutory provisions.  Section 3004, \n28  setting forth the status of the Harmonized Tariff schedule, confirms this: \n6 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 7 of 14\n \n1   \n(1) The following shall be considered to be statutory provisions of \n2  law for all purposes: \n(A) The provisions of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule as enacted by \n3  this chapter. \n(B) Each statutory amendment to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. \n4  (C) Each modification or change made to the Harmonized Tariff \nSchedule  by  the  President  under  authority  of  law  (including \n5  section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974). \n6  19 U.S.C. § 3004(c) (emphasis added).  Because the executive orders imposing tariffs are laws of \n7  the United States, California’s lawsuit challenging those executive orders “arises out of” a “law of \n8  the United States providing for . . . tariffs.”  So, pursuant to section 1581(i), this matter falls within \n9  the CIT’s exclusive jurisdiction. \n10    California disputes this conclusion in a footnote in its opposition, arguing “President \n11  Trump’s executive orders are not ‘law[s] of the United States.’”  (Dkt. No. 12 at 19 n.4.)  The two \n12  cases California cites to support this proposition do not bear on the present case.  In Leath v. \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  Stetson, 686 F.2d 769, 771 (9th Cir. 1982), the Ninth Circuit stated an executive order was “not a \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  law of the United States for purposes of giving district courts jurisdiction under the federal \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  question statute.”  The Leath court said nothing about whether executive orders imposing tariffs \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  are laws of the United States for purposes of section 1581.  California also cites Sierra Club v. \nS d nr\nee 17  United States Department of Energy, 134 F.4th 568, 573 (D.C. Cir. 2025), in which the court \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  stated “an executive order is not ‘law’ within the meaning of the Constitution.”  Again, this case \n19  says nothing about whether executive orders regarding tariffs are laws within the meaning of \n20  section 1581.  Moreover, Sierra Club—and California v. Environmental Protection Agency, 72 \n21  F.4th 308, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2023), which it cites—involved executive orders “devoted solely to the \n22  internal management of the executive branch.”  California, 72 F.4th at 318 (involving an executive \n23  order requiring agencies to consider environmental effects of their actions on minorities and low-\n24  income populations); Sierra Club, 134 F.4th at 572 (involving an executive order directing \n25  agencies to review “any of the previous administration’s regulations, orders and other actions that \n26  might affect the environment”).  The executive orders at issue are not broad formulations of policy \n27  or directions regarding Executive Branch management, but instead modifications to the \n28  Harmonized Tariff Schedule set by statute.  To conclude these executive orders are not laws of the \n7 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 8 of 14\n \n1  United States would contradict section 3004, which states “modification[s] . . . to the Harmonized \n2  Tariff Schedule by the President under authority of law” “shall be considered to be statutory \n3  provisions of law for all purposes.”   \n4    At oral argument, California also argued President Trump’s executive orders imposing \n5  tariffs fall outside the scope of section 3004 because the executive orders were not made under \n6  authority of law.  See 19 U.S.C. § 3004(c) (stating modifications made “by the President under \n7  authority of law” are statutory provisions).  As an initial matter, section 3004 does not say “under \n8  authority of valid law” or something suggesting courts should conduct a threshold review to \n9  decide whether the President’s modification to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule is lawful.  More to \n10  the point, to decide whether the tariffs were authorized by law would require the Court to decide \n11  whether IEEPA permits the tariffs President Trump imposed—the very question the CIT recently \n12  ruled on.  As discussed below, it would contravene Congressional intent for this Court to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  separately make that determination.  \nCfi\n tla\nciC 14  II.  CONGRESS INTENDED UNIFORM ADMINISTRATION OF CUSTOMS LAWS \nrts fo\niD tc 15  Section 1581 was intended to “create[] a comprehensive system of judicial review of civil \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  actions arising from import transactions:”   \nS d nr  \nee 17  The Committee believes that the clarification and expansion of the \nth\nintr customs courts’ jurisdiction will help to assure access to judicial \nUo\nN 18  review of civil actions arising from import transactions.  The customs \ncourts  are  national  courts  and  their  decisions  are  nationwide  in \n19  impact.    Thus,  a  clarification  of  jurisdiction  will  eliminate  the \npossibility of conflicting decision on any one point of dispute.  This, \n20  coupled with their current expertise in the area, would enable the \ncustoms courts to render extremely expeditions decisions in matters \n21  which are important both to our country and to our trading partners. \n \n22 \nS. Rep. No. 96-466, at 3-4 (1979).  Specifically, subsection (i) of section 1581 was added to \n23 \n“grant[] broad residual jurisdiction to the United States Court of International Trade.”  S. Rep. 96-\n24 \n1235, at 33 (1980).  While the statute as initially proposed conferred jurisdiction when a civil \n25 \naction against the government “involve[d]” certain enumerated statutes, legislators were \n26 \nconcerned “that the listing of specific statutes would result in an inadvertent omission of a statute, \n27 \nthereby creating further confusion in the minds of international trade law litigants.”  Id. at 33-34.  \n28 \n8 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 9 of 14\n \n1  So, “rather than a specific listing of statutes,” Congress opted for “a generic approach . . . in an \n2  effort to provide greater protection for the rights of persons involved in disputes arising out of \n3  import transactions.”  Id. at 34.  That is, section 1581 was amended to provide the CIT with \n4  “jurisdiction over those civil actions which arise out of a law of the United States pertaining to \n5  international trade.”  Id.  This action arises out of a law pertaining to international trade—whether \n6  that law is the Harmonized Tariff Schedule the executive orders modified, the executive orders \n7  themselves, or IEEPA.  So, concluding the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter is \n8  consistent with Congressional intent.  See Pentax Corp, 72 F.3d at 711 (quoting Conoco, Inc. v. \n9  United States Foreign–Trade Zones Bd., 18 F.3d 1581, 1589 (Fed Cir.1994)) (an area of law is \n10  “within the exclusive jurisdiction of the CIT” when “that area is ‘within the parameters of’ section \n11  1581 and deals with ‘type of issues with which CIT is acknowledged to have expertise’”). \n12  That is especially so here, where multiple cases challenging the same executive orders are \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  before the CIT.  See V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-cv-66 (Ct. Int’l Trade Apr 14, 2025); \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Oregon v. Trump, No. 25-cv-66 (Ct. Int’l Trade Apr. 23, 2025); Princess Awesome, LLC v. United \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  States Customs and Border Protection, No. 25-cv-78 (Ct. Int’l Trade Apr 24, 2025).  In all three \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  cases, the CIT chief judge—“[p]ursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 253(c) and 255 and Rule 77(e) of the \nS d nr\nee 17  Rules of this Court”—assigned the cases to a three-judge panel.  (Case No. 25-cv-66, Dkt. No. 8; \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Case No. 25-cv-77, Dkt. No. 6; Case No. 25-cv-78, Dkt. No. 12.)  See 28 U.S.C. § 255(a) \n19  (permitting the CIT chief judge “to designate any three judges of the court to hear and determine \n20  any civil action which the chief judge finds: (1) raises an issue of the constitutionality of an Act of \n21  Congress, a proclamation of the President or an Executive order; or (2) has broad or significant \n22  implications in the administration or interpretation of the customs laws”).  On May 28, 2025, the \n23  CIT granted the V.O.S. Selections and Oregon plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment.  V.O.S. \n24  Selections, Inc. v. United States, No. 25-00066, 2025 WL 1514124, at *1 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 28, \n25  2025).  In so doing, the CIT stated it “has exclusive jurisdiction to hear this action under 28 U.S.C. \n26  § 1581(i).”  Id. at *8 (“For the purpose of locating jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i), an \n27  action involving a challenge to a presidential action that imposes tariffs, duties, or other import \n28  restrictions is one that arises from a ‘law providing for’ those measures.”).   \n9 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 10 of 14\n \n1  Another CIT judge considering a motion to dismiss an action challenging the tariffs \n2  imposed by President Trump likewise concluded “it has Section 1581(i) jurisdiction over this \n3  case.”  (Dkt. No. 51-1 at 10.)  Moreover, two district courts granted motions to transfer to the CIT \n4  cases challenging the same tariff executive orders.  Webber v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., No. \n5  CV 25-26-GF-DLC, 2025 WL 1207587, at *7 (D. Mont. Apr. 25, 2025) (cleaned up) \n6  (“Consolidating tariff matters with the Court of International Trade ensures a necessary degree of \n7  uniformity and consistency throughout the United States.”); Emily Ley Paper, Inc., v. Trump, No. \n8  3:25-CV-464-TKW-ZCB, 2025 WL 1482771, at *1 (N.D. Fla. May 20, 2025) (cleaned up) (“The \n9  conclusion that this case should be transferred to the CIT furthers § 1581’s purpose of ensuring \n10  uniformity in the judicial decisionmaking process on trade issues.”).   \n11  It would be inconsistent with Congressional intent for this Court to nevertheless exercise \n12  its jurisdiction, as California urges, to decide whether the tariffs are lawful.  That inconsistency \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  becomes apparent when considering a hypothetical scenario in which this Court exercises \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  jurisdiction over California’s lawsuit and reaches a different result than the CIT as to whether to \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  enjoin the tariffs.  What, then, of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule?  What duties would be \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  collected on imports?  Such a result would contravene Congress’s goal of “ensuring a uniform \nS d nr\nee 17  procedure for the judicial review of international trade disputes.”  S. Rep. 96-1235 at 30. \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  III.  DISMISSAL IS APPROPRIATE UNDER SECTION 1631 \n19  Because executive orders modifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule are laws of the \n20  United States, and because the executive orders at issue here indisputably provide for tariffs, this \n21  civil action “arises out of [a] law of the United States providing for . . . tariffs.”  So, the CIT has \n22  exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1).  And because the action falls within the CIT’s \n23  exclusive jurisdiction, this Court lacks jurisdiction.  See K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U.S. \n24  176, 182–83 (1988) (“The District Court would be divested of jurisdiction . . . if this action fell \n25  within one of several specific grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International \n26  Trade.”); see also 28 U.S.C. § 1340 (“The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any \n27  civil action arising under any Act of Congress providing for internal revenue, or revenue from \n28  imports or tonnage except matters within the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade.”).   \n10 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 11 of 14\n \n1  The Government seeks to transfer the case to the CIT pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1631, which \n2  provides “[w]henever a civil action is filed in a court . . . and that court finds that there is a want of \n3  jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to any \n4  other such court . . . in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed \n5  or noticed.”  At oral argument, California asked the Court, if it concludes it lacks jurisdiction, to \n6  dismiss rather than transfer the action to allow California to appeal the decision.  See 28 U.S.C. § \n7  1291 (“The courts of appeals . . . shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the \n8  district courts of the United States”).  As the Government argued in Webber v. U.S. Department of \n9  Homeland Security—in which the plaintiffs challenging the tariff executive orders appealed a \n10  Montana District Court order transferring the case to the CIT—the Ninth Circuit “lacks appellate \n11  jurisdiction to review the district court’s interlocutory transfer order” because the Ninth Circuit \n12  “reviews final orders” and “an order transferring a case under 28 U.S.C § 1631 for litigation to \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  continue in another court is necessarily not final.”  (Case No. 25-2717, Dkt. No. 7.)   \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  Under section 1631, transfer is not mandatory upon finding a lack of jurisdiction.  The \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  statute provides the court shall transfer the case if it is in the interest of justice.  “Normally transfer \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  will be in the interest of justice because normally dismissal of an action that could be brought \nS d nr\nee 17  elsewhere is time-consuming and justice-defeating.”  Amity Rubberized Pen Co. v. Mkt. Quest \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Grp. Inc., 793 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up).  The Ninth Circuit applied this rule to \n19  transfer cases when the plaintiff was “unaware of or confused about the proper forum in which to \n20  file their action,” Munns v. Kerry, 782 F.3d 402, 415 (9th Cir. 2015) (cleaned up), and when “[t]he \n21  statutory period for seeking interlocutory review ha[d] elapsed.”  Kennecott Corp. v. U.S. Dist. Ct. \n22  for S. Dist. of California, 873 F.2d 1292, 1293 (9th Cir. 1989).  As these cases indicate, the \n23  “interest of justice” analysis emphasizes the plaintiff’s interests.  See also Amiti, 793 F.3d at 991 \n24  (“[T]ransfer will often serve as a means to prevent the injustice of penalizing a party for an honest \n25  procedural mistake”); In re McCauley, 814 F.2d 1350, 1352 (9th Cir. 1987) (cleaned up) (stating \n26  section 1631 “serves to aid litigants who were confused about the proper forum for review”); \n27  Miller v. Hambrick, 905 F.2d 259, 262 (9th Cir. 1990) (concluding district court abused its \n28  discretion for failing to determine whether prisoner’s petition for writ of habitus corpus “could \n11 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 12 of 14\n \n1  have been brought in the district of [his] ‘regular place of incarceration’ and whether transfer \n2  would have been in the interest of justice” under section 1631).  In this case, when California—the \n3  party who filed the lawsuit—requests dismissal rather than transfer, it is not in the interest of \n4  justice to transfer the case. \n5  At oral argument, the Government could not articulate why transfer over California’s \n6  objection serves the interests of justice.  The Government argued it is in the interest of justice to \n7  ensure the correct forum rules on California’s claims.  The Court agrees, and dismissal facilitates \n8  that result by allowing the Ninth Circuit to decide whether this Court has jurisdiction over a \n9  lawsuit challenging the President’s imposition of tariffs and/or to what extent district courts should \n10  consider the merits of a case in deciding if a matter falls within the CIT’s exclusive jurisdiction.   \n11  The Government also argued Ninth Circuit precedent requires transfer rather than \n12  dismissal, noting in Pentax Corp. v. Myhra, 72 F.3d 708, 711 (9th Cir. 1995), the Ninth Circuit \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  “conclude[d] the prudent thing to do [was] to direct the district court to transfer the case to the CIT \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  so that the CIT [could] determine the question of its own jurisdiction.”  In Pentax, the plaintiff had \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  argued “the interests of justice require . . . transfer, because if the case is not transferred [the \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  plaintiff’s] claim may be barred by the statute of limitations.”  Id.  Without expressing an “opinion \nS d nr\nee 17  on the statute of limitations issue or whether the CIT would have had original jurisdiction,” the \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  Ninth Circuit transferred the case “so that the CIT [could] determine the question of its own \n19  jurisdiction.”  Id.  Like the section 1631 cases described above, the Pentax court’s decision to \n20  transfer was based on the plaintiff’s interest in resolving its claim.  The Court does not understand \n21  Pentax—or United States v. Universal Fruits & Vegetables Corp., 370 F.3d 829, 836–37 (9th Cir. \n22  2004), which cites Pentax—to mean section 1631 requires transfer over the plaintiff’s objection.  \n23  Nor does the Court understand Pentax to mean the Court must transfer whenever there is \n24  ambiguity about the CIT’s jurisdiction.  Such interpretation would conflict with the language of \n25  section 1631, which requires transfer if it is in the interest of justice “[w]henever . . . a court . . . \n26  finds that there is a want of jurisdiction.”  28 U.S.C. § 1631.  So, section 1631 applies when a \n27  court has found jurisdiction lacking, not when a court thinks jurisdiction could be lacking.    \n28  Following oral argument, the Government sought leave to file a supplemental brief \n12 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 13 of 14\n \n1  responding to California’s request to dismiss rather than transfer the case.  (Dkt. No. 59.)  The \n2  Court granted the request.  (Dkt. No. 61.)  Having reviewed the Government’s supplemental brief, \n3  the Court is not persuaded transfer is in the interest of justice in this case.  The section 1631 cases \n4  the Government cites reinforce transfer as the proper remedy when it advances the plaintiff’s \n5  interests.  For example, in Taati v. Cigna Healthcare, Inc., No. CV 08-05164 MMM (PLAx), 2008 \n6  WL 11423917, at *7 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 19, 2008), the court transferred the case to a forum where all \n7  the defendants were subject to personal jurisdiction to “protect [the plaintiff] from any prejudice \n8  resulting from her confusion.”  The court observed “[n]othing suggest[ed] that [the plaintiff] filed \n9  her action in California in bad faith; rather, given that she is pro se, and given the interpretation of \n10  the personal jurisdiction rules set out in her pleadings, it is clear that she was confused about the \n11  proper forum for review.  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  And in Amerijet International, Inc. v. \n12  United States Department of Homeland Security, 43 F. Supp. 3d 4, 21 (D.D.C. 2014), the court \na \ntr in\nuoro 13  concluded “transfer, not dismissal, [was] the preferable disposition” when it was the plaintiff who \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14  sought transfer and the defendants who “firmly reject[ed]” that proposition.  Here, the roles are \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15  reversed: California, the plaintiff—whose interest courts seek to protect in evaluating transfer \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16  under section 1631—requests dismissal whereas the Government requests transfer.   \nS d nr\nee 17  The Government’s other case citations are unpersuasive because they involved different \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18  provisions.  See Dearth v. Mukasey, 516 F.3d 413, 415-16 (6th Cir. 2008) (considering transfer for \n19  improper venue pursuant to sections 1404 and 1406); Concha v. London, 62 F.3d 1493, 1506 (9th \n20  Cir. 1995) (considering voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(1)).  The Government also argues \n21  Congress “decided against making transfer orders immediately appealable” and dismissal here \n22  would “create a loophole to appellate jurisdiction.”  (Dkt. No. 59-1 at 2.)  But under section 1631, \n23  transfer is only required when it is “in the interest of justice.”  So, the statute apparently \n24  contemplates the present situation—in which the court concludes it lacks jurisdiction and that \n25  transfer is not in the interest of justice, leaving dismissal as the proper course of action. \n26  CONCLUSION \n27    Pursuant to section 1581(i), this action falls within the CIT’s exclusive jurisdiction and this \n28  Court is without jurisdiction.  Because California opposes transfer and instead requests dismissal, \n13 \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 62     Filed 06/02/25     Page 14 of 14\n \n1  transfer is not in the interest of justice under section 1631.  So, the Court DENIES the \n2  Government’s motion to transfer and DISMISSES the case without prejudice.  A separate \n3  judgment order will issue.   \n4    This Order disposes of Docket No. 9. \n5  IT IS SO ORDERED. \n6  Dated: June 2, 2025 \n7   \n8     \nJACQUELINE SCOTT CORLEY \n9 \nUnited States District Judge \n10 \n11 \n12 \na \ntr in\nuoro 13 \nCfi\n tla\ncC 14 \ni\nrts fo\niD tc 15 \n sir\net\ntatsiD 16 \nS d nr\nee 17 \nth\nintr\nUo\nN 18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n14 ",

President Donald J. Trump has launched an unprecedented tariff regime by relying on \n3  the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA) and a purported national emergency \n4  arising from persistent trade deficits.   \n5  2.  In just the last two weeks, President Trump has imposed a universal 10% tariff on \n6  virtually all imported goods and sweeping “reciprocal” tariffs on dozens of countries, before \n7  pausing the reciprocal tariffs for 90 days, and then increasing retaliatory tariffs on China to 145% \n8  in response to its countermeasures. \n9  3.  President Trump also invoked IEEPA and a purported national emergency arising \n10  from the trafficking of drugs and persons to impose, then pause, then re-impose, and then \n11  partially exempt, tariffs of up to 25% on Canada and Mexico, all in just over a month in February \n12  and March 2025. \n13  4.  Tariffs, however, are not among the numerous actions that IEEPA authorizes the \n14  President to take under a declared emergency; indeed, the word “tariff” does not appear in the \n15  relevant statute at all.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1702.  And no President has previously relied on IEEPA to \n16  impose tariffs in the half a century since its enactment. \n17  5.  The United States Constitution vests the authority to impose tariffs in Congress, see \n18  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, and Congress has enacted numerous statutes delegating tariff authority to \n19  the President that expressly authorize imposition of tariffs, generally following required process \n20  and notice. \n21  6.  Rather than comply with the process and notice requirements set forth in those \n22  statutes, President Trump issued over a dozen executive orders invoking IEEPA, under the view \n23  that IEEPA grants him unilateral authority to impose unprecedented tariffs. \n24  7.  President Trump’s new tariff regime has already had devastating impacts on the \n25  economy, creating chaos in the stock and bond markets, wiping out hundreds of billions of dollars \n26  in market capitalization in hours, chilling investment in the face of such consequential \n27  Presidential action with no notice or process, and threatening to push the country into recession.  \n28  These harms will only continue to grow, as President Trump’s tariffs are projected to shrink the \n \n  1   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 3 of 23\n \n1  economy by $100 billion annually.1 \n2  8.  As the fifth largest economy in the world, the State of California, along with its \n3  residents and small businesses, is directly harmed by the tariffs.  All will face higher costs due to \n4  the 10% universal tariffs now in effect on virtually all imported goods and the substantial \n5  additional tariffs imposed on Chinese, Mexican, and Canadian goods, with even higher costs \n6  threatened by the still-looming reciprocal tariffs.  And certain industries and businesses, including \n7  agriculture and entertainment, now face retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and threatened by \n8  other countries. \n9  9.  Under our constitutional system, the President may not rule by fiat.  Instead, “[t]he \n10  President’s power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the \n11  Constitution itself.”  Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952). \n12  10.  And where the economic and political significance is as staggering, and the power \n13  asserted is so novel and transformative as it is with the unprecedented tariffs that President Trump \n14  has imposed here, the President must have “clear congressional authorization” to justify his \n15  executive actions.  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 506 (2023). \n16  11.  IEEPA provides no such clear congressional authorization for President Trump’s \n17  tariffs, nor the vast expansion of Presidential power to tax all goods entering the United States on \n18  a whim. \n19  12.  Through this action, the State of California and California Governor Gavin Newsom \n20  seek declaratory and injunctive relief to block the tariffs imposed by President Trump pursuant to \n21  IEEPA because they are not authorized by that statute.    \n22  JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTRADISTRICT ASSIGNMENT \n23  13.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 (action arising under the \n24  Constitution or laws of the United States).  An actual controversy exists between the parties \n25  within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a), and the Court may grant declaratory relief, injunctive \n26   \n1 Where We Stand: The Fiscal, Economic, and Distributional Effects of All U.S. Tariffs Enacted \n27  in 2025 Through April 2, THE BUDGET LAB AT YALE UNIV.

Plaintiff State of California, by and through Attorney General Rob Bonta, brings this \n9  action as a sovereign state in the United States of America.  The Attorney General is the chief law \n10  officer of the State and has the authority to file civil actions in order to protect public rights and \n11  interests.  Cal. Const. art. V, § 13; Cal. Gov’t Code § 12511.  This challenge is brought under the \n12  Attorney General’s independent constitutional, statutory, and common-law authority to bring suit \n13  and obtain relief on behalf of the State. \n14  17.  Plaintiff Gavin Newsom is the Governor of California.  Governor Newsom brings this \n15  challenge in his official capacity. \n16  18.  Defendant Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States.  He is sued in his \n17  official capacity.  \n18  19.  Defendant Kristi Noem is the Secretary of Homeland Security.  She is sued in her \n19  official capacity. \n20  20.  Defendant Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is an independent federal \n21  agency.  \n22  21.  Defendant Pete R. Flores is the Acting Commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border \n23  Protection (CBP).  He is sued in his official capacity. \n24  22.  Defendant U.S. Customs and Border Protection is an independent federal agency.   \n25  23.  Defendants Noem, DHS, Flores, and CBP are collectively referred to as Agency \n26  Defendants. \n27 \n28 \n \n  3   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 5 of 23\n \n1  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \n2  I.  No President Has Ever Imposed Tariffs Under IEEPA in Its Near-Half-Century \nHistory—Until President Trump Cited IEEPA to Unilaterally Issue Over a Dozen \n3  Executive Orders to Impose or Modify Tariffs in the Last Two-and-a-Half Months \n4  24.  No President other than President Trump has ever imposed tariffs under IEEPA in the \n5  nearly half century since its enactment in 1977. \n6  25.  President Trump has become the first and only such President, issuing over a dozen \n7  executive orders imposing or modifying tariffs pursuant to IEEPA since February 1, 2025 to \n8  date.2   \n9  26.  A tariff is a tax placed on goods imported into a country.  It is assessed on the good at \n10  the port of entry, so the cost is borne by the distributor who is receiving the goods in the United \n11  States, not on the country of origin.  The tariffs’ effects are thus immediate. \n12  27.  DHS and CBP are the agencies collecting and enforcing President Trump’s tariffs. \n13  28.  These executive orders fall into two broad categories: (1) country-specific tariffs on \n14  Mexico, Canada, and China; and (2) universal tariffs and reciprocal tariffs. \n15  A.  President Trump’s Country-Specific Tariffs \n16  29.  On February 1, 2025, the President issued three executive orders imposing tariffs on \n17  imports from California’s three largest trading partners: Mexico, Canada, and China.  \n18  30.  As described in detail below, Mexico and Canada are currently subject to tariffs of \n19  25% (with certain exceptions), and China is subject to tariffs of 145% in total. \n20  1.  Tariffs on Mexico  \n21  31.  On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order imposing 25% \n22  tariffs on all products imported from Mexico, to go into effect just three days later, on February 4, \n23  2025.3 \n24  32.  In the executive order imposing these tariffs, President Trump cited to IEEPA \n25 \n \n26  2 Although President Trump threatened to impose tariffs under IEEPA in his first term, he \nsuspended the implementation of those tariffs. \n27 \n3 Exec.

(NEA), \n2  section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. § 2483), and section 301 of title 3, \n3  United States Code, but he specifically invoked authority for the order under section \n4  1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA.4 \n5  33.  In the order, President Trump also cited a Proclamation issued on January 20, 2025, \n6  in which he declared a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border “with respect to the grave \n7  threat to the United States posed by the influx of illegal aliens and illicit drugs into the United \n8  States.”  The order “expand[ed]” the scope of that emergency to include “the failure of Mexico to \n9  arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept [drug trafficking organizations], other drug and human \n10  traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit drugs.”   \n11  34.  Just two days later, on February 3, 2025, President Trump issued another executive \n12  order announcing a pause on the 25% tariff on Mexican goods for one month.5   \n13  35.  The tariffs went into effect on March 4, 2025. \n14  36.  Two days later, on March 6, 2025, President Trump issued another executive order \n15  exempting goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) from the tariffs, \n16  effective March 7, 2025.6  USMCA-covered goods account for approximately half of imports \n17  from Mexico; the other half remain subject to the 25% tariffs, which are currently in effect.  \n18 \n19 \n \n20  4 The NEA, section 604 of the Trade Act, and section 301 of title 3, do not give presidents any \nsubstantive authority to take any actions.  The NEA provides a framework for declaring a national \n21  emergency but does not itself provide for the President to exercise any authority to take action \npursuant to that declaration.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1631 (“When the President declares a national \n22  emergency, no powers or authorities made available by statute for use in the event of an \nemergency shall be exercised unless and until the President specifies the provisions of law under \n23  which he proposes that he, or other officers will act.”).  Section 604 is a ministerial statute that \nprovides that the President periodically update the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n24  States, a schedule that sets out the tariff rates for all merchandise imported into the United States.  \n19 U.S.C. § 2483.  Section 301 is a general statute that simply provides that the President may \n25  delegate functions to subordinate officials.  3 U.S.C. § 301. \n26  5 Exec.

Tariffs on Canada \n2  37.  On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order imposing 25% \n3  tariffs on all imports from Canada, with the exception of energy resources, on which he imposed \n4  a 10% tariff.7  The tariffs were slated to go into effect just three days later, on February 4, 2025. \n5  38.  In the executive order imposing these tariffs, President Trump cited to IEEPA, the \n6  NEA, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and 3 U.S.C. § 301, but he specifically \n7  invoked authority for the order under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA. \n8  39.  Despite this order pertaining to Canada, President Trump cited the same Proclamation \n9  declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.  He “expand[ed]” this emergency to \n10  Canada, “to cover the threat to the safety and security of Americans, including the public health \n11  crisis of deaths due to the use of fentanyl and other illicit drugs, and the failure of Canada to do \n12  more to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept [drug trafficking organizations], other drug \n13  and human traffickers, criminals at large, and drugs.”  \n14  40.  The same day the President issued his executive order, Canada announced it planned \n15  to impose 25% retaliatory tariffs on $155 billion worth of various goods imported from the \n16  United States.  In doing so, Canada noted that “[l]ess than 1 per cent of the fentanyl and illegal \n17  crossings into the United States come from Canada.”   \n18  41.  Two days later, on February 3, 2025, President Trump issued another executive order \n19  announcing a pause on the tariffs on Canada for one month.   \n20  42.  The tariffs went into effect on March 4, 2025. \n21  43.  Canada announced it was moving forward with 25% retaliatory tariffs on $30 billion \n22  of U.S. goods, which are currently in place.  Some of the goods affected by Canada’s retaliatory \n23  tariffs, such as wine, have a particularized impact on California, which produces approximately \n24  80% of American wine. \n25  44.  Two days later, President Trump exempted goods covered by the U.S.-Mexico-\n26 \n27   \n7 Exec. Order 14,193 (Feb. 1, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/\n28  imposing-duties-to-address-the-flow-of-illicit-drugs-across-our-national-border/. \n \n  6   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 8 of 23\n \n1  Canada Agreement from the tariffs, effective March 7, 2025.8  USMCA-covered goods account \n2  for approximately 38% of goods from Canada; the majority of goods imported from Canada \n3  (62%) remain subject to the 25% tariffs. \n4  3.  Tariffs on China \n5  45.  On February 1, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order imposing a 10% \n6  tariff on China.9  This was imposed on top of pre-existing tariffs on certain Chinese goods (not \n7  imposed under IEEPA), for an effective tariff rate of 20%. \n8  46.  In the executive order imposing these tariffs, President Trump cited to IEEPA, the \n9  NEA, section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, and 3 U.S.C. § 301, but he specifically \n10  invoked authority for the order under section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA. \n11  47.  Like the Mexico and Canada executive orders, President Trump’s order on China \n12  cited the same Proclamation declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border.  He \n13  similarly now applied it to China: the order “expand[ed]” the scope of that emergency to include \n14  “the failure of the [People’s Republic of China] government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise \n15  intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other [transnational criminal \n16  organizations], criminals at large, and drugs.”  \n17  48.  On February 4, 2024, the additional 10% tariffs on China went into effect as \n18  scheduled, just three days after their initial announcement.  The same day, China announced \n19  retaliatory tariffs of 10–15% on a list of eighty U.S. products, effective February 10, 2025.  \n20  49.  Unlike the Canada and Mexico tariffs, President Trump did not pause the tariffs on \n21  China.  Unsurprisingly, a tit-for-tat trade war with China ensued, with President Trump raising \n22  tariffs, and China responding in kind.10 \n23   \n8 Exec.

As of April 16, 2025, Chinese goods are subject to a staggering 145% effective tariff \n2  rate in the United States, and U.S. goods are subject to 125% retaliatory tariffs in China.  China \n3  has also suspended all exports of rare-earth materials and magnets, which are crucial for the car, \n4  semiconductor, and aerospace industries, and is pausing its purchases of aircraft from Boeing, \n5  America’s largest exporter. \n6  B.  President Trump’s Universal and “Reciprocal” Tariffs \n7  51.  President Trump did not stop at imposing the aforementioned country-specific tariffs \n8  on the United States’ largest trading partners. \n9  52.  On April 2, 2025—a day he dubbed “Liberation Day”—President Trump broadened \n10  the scope of his IEEPA tariffs to the entire globe by announcing the most sweeping tariff increase \n11  since the Great Depression, again relying on a purported emergency in order to do so.11  \n12  53.   As discussed infra, these tariffs include a 10% universal tariff on all U.S. trading \n13  partners and “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50% on almost ninety specific countries. \n14  54.  In the executive orders imposing and modifying these tariffs,12 President Trump \n15 \n \n16  tariffs on various U.S. agricultural products.  The United States then imposed reciprocal tariffs on \nmultiple countries, discussed infra in Section I.B.2, adding new tariffs on China of 34%.

The White House repeatedly made clear that the tariffs were being \n3  imposed “[u]sing [the President’s] IEEPA authority,” and referred to the executive order as \n4  “[t]oday’s IEEPA Order[.]”13 \n5  55.  In the order imposing these tariffs, President Trump declared a national emergency, \n6  which he characterized as “underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral \n7  trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ \n8  economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and \n9  persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits” and a decline in U.S. manufacturing capacity dating \n10  back to 1997. \n11  1.  Universal Tariffs \n12  56.  On April 2, 2025, President Trump issued an executive order imposing a 10% \n13  universal tariff, which is a flat-rate import tax that applies to goods from all U.S. trading \n14  partners.14 \n15  57.  This tariff took effect on April 5, 2025, and is currently in effect.  \n16  2.  “Reciprocal” Tariffs \n17  58.  Also on April 2, 2025, President Trump announced individualized “reciprocal”15 \n18 \n19   \n13 Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares National Emergency to Increase our \n20  Competitive Edge, Protect our Sovereignty, and Strengthen our National and Economic Security, \nTHE WHITE HOUSE (Apr. 2, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-\n21  president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-\nour-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/ [hereinafter Fact Sheet \n22  (Apr. 2, 2025)]. \n23  14 These tariffs do not apply to tariffs already announced on a specific product or industry.  They \nalso do not affect current tariffs on Canada and Mexico; as such, tariffs on USMCA-compliant \n24  goods remain paused, and non-USMCA-compliant goods remain subject to a 25% tariff. \n25  15 “Reciprocal” is a misnomer, as the calculation used to formulate the tariff rates is not actually \nreciprocal.  See, e.g., David Goldman, This is the dubious way Trump calculated his ‘reciprocal’ \n26  tariffs, CNN (Apr. 3, 2025), https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/03/economy/reciprocal-tariff-math/\nindex.html.  Rather, President Trump used “a simple calculation: the country’s trade deficit \n27  divided by its exports to the United States times 1/2.”  Id.  This approach punishes high-deficit \ntrading partners from which the United States imports a lot and buys little from, not necessarily \n28  those with the most restrictive trade regimes.  \n \n  9   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 11 of 23\n \n1  higher tariffs of up to 50% on nearly ninety specific countries.16 \n2  59.  These tariffs apply to some of the United States’ largest trading partners, such as the \n3  European Union, which accounted for $605.76 billion of U.S. imports last year and is subject to a \n4  20% tariff, and Vietnam, which accounted for $135.56 billion of U.S. imports and is subject to a \n5  whopping 46% tariff. \n6  60.  China, the United States’ third largest trading partner after Mexico and Canada, is \n7  subject to a 34% reciprocal tariff, which stacks on top of other tariffs.  \n8  61.  Even regions or countries with little or no trading footprint are affected: for example, \n9  a 10% reciprocal tariff was placed on remote Australian islands where many penguins but no \n10  people live. \n11  62.  The reciprocal tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025, at 12:01 a.m., but that same day, \n12  President Trump announced they would be paused for 90 days, until July 9, 2025.17   \n13  63.  While on pause, the countries that were subject to reciprocal tariff are instead subject \n14  to the 10% universal tariff, which is currently in effect. \n15  64.  The pause does not apply to China. \n16  C.  The Immediate Impact of President Trump’s Tariffs \n17  65.  The impacts of President Trump’s tariffs in recent weeks have been felt by countries, \n18  businesses, and individuals around the globe. \n19  66.  Particularly, the economic impact of President Trump’s April 2, 2025, announcement \n20  of universal and reciprocal tariffs was historic and unprecedented.  In the two days following his \n21  announcement, the U.S. stock market lost a record $6.6 trillion, the largest two-day loss in its \n22 \n \n23  16 Exec. Order 14,257 (Apr. 2, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/\nregulating-imports-with-a-reciprocal-tariff-to-rectify-trade-practices-that-contribute-to-large-and-\n24  persistent-annual-united-states-goods-trade-deficits/.  These new tariffs also do not affect prior \norders for Mexico and Canada  There are other exceptions, including: “(1) articles subject to 50 \n25  USC 1702(b); (2) steel/aluminum articles and autos/auto parts already subject to Section 232 \ntariffs; (3) copper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, and lumber articles; (4) all articles that may \n26  become subject to future Section 232 tariffs; (5) bullion; and (6) energy and other certain minerals \nthat are not available in the United States.”  Fact Sheet (Apr. 2, 2025), supra note 13. \n27 \n17 Exec. Order 14,266 (Apr. 9, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/\n28  modifying-reciprocal-tariff-rates-to-reflect-trading-partner-retaliation-and-alignment/. \n \n  10   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 12 of 23\n \n1  history.  While it recovered some of that loss, the stock market has continued to fluctuate wildly. \n2  67.  Notably, the market for U.S. Government bonds—the bedrock of the financial \n3  system—has suffered a sharp sell-off since the week of President’s Trump announcement.  \n4  68.  And President’s Trump’s tariffs imposed as of April 2, 2025, are projected to shrink \n5  the U.S. economy by $100 billion annually, increase inflation by 1.3%, and cost the average \n6  American family $2,100.18 \n7  69.  California, as a leader in global trade, bears an inordinate share of these costs.  And \n8  those costs directly impact California’s Governor, whose ability to respond to the State’s \n9  emergencies and enact his policy goals and the prerogatives of the State’s Legislature are \n10  frustrated by the economic impact of President Trump’s tariffs.  See infra Section III, Harm to \n11  California and the Governor of California. \n12  70.  Furthermore, several countries have either retaliated, or have announced plans for \n13  future retaliation, in light of President Trump’s tariffs.  This is not limited to China, which, as \n14  described above, has imposed retaliatory tariffs on the United States of 125% and has stopped \n15  exporting certain critical goods.  The European Union indicated that it was “preparing further \n16  countermeasures to protect [its] interests and [its] businesses if negotiations fail.”  Other \n17  countries, like Brazil, have passed laws that give their governments legal authority to impose \n18  retaliatory tariffs.  \n19  II.  President Trump Lacked Legal Authority to Issue the IEEPA Tariff Orders \n20  A.  Under the Doctrine of Separation of Powers, the President May Not Rule by \nFiat \n21 \n71.  In our constitutional system, the President may not rule by fiat. \n22 \n72.  Instead, under our democratic system of checks and balances, “[t]he President’s \n23 \npower, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the \n24 \nConstitution itself.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. \n25 \n73.  The Constitution does not vest in the President any authority to impose tariffs. \n26 \n27   \n18 These numbers would be even higher today, as tariffs on China have skyrocketed from 20% to \n28  145% since April 2. \n \n  11   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 13 of 23\n \n1  74.  Rather, the Constitution expressly vests the authority to impose tariffs solely in \n2  Congress, not the President.  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8 (“The Congress shall have Power To lay and \n3  collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises . . . .”). \n4  75.  Congress’s power in this area is exhaustive.  Brushaber v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., 240 \n5  U.S. 1, 12 (1916) (“the authority conferred upon Congress by § 8 of article 1 ‘to lay and collect \n6  taxes, duties, imposts and excises’ is exhaustive and embraces every conceivable power of \n7  taxation”). \n8  76.  Because the Constitution does not vest in the President any authority to impose \n9  tariffs, any authority for the President to do so must come, if at all, from an act of Congress. \n10  B.  Congress Enacted the International Emergency Economic Powers Act as Part \nof a Series of Reforms to Limit Presidential Authority and to Prevent \n11  Presidential Abuse of Power \n12  77.  President Trump cites IEEPA as the basis for his authority to issue the IEEPA Tariff \n13  Orders. \n14  78.  But IEEPA does not authorize President Trump to issue the tariffs he has imposed. \n15  79.  Rather, IEEPA was enacted by Congress as part of a series of reforms to limit \n16  presidential authority and to prevent presidential abuse of power. \n17  80.  And IEEPA does not so much as mention tariffs, much less authorize President \n18  Trump to unilaterally impose unprecedented tariffs at his whim. \n19  81.  In the mid-1970s, following U.S. military involvement in Vietnam, revelations of \n20  domestic spying, assassinations of foreign political leaders, the Watergate break-in, and other \n21  related abuses of power, Congress increasingly focused on checking the Executive Branch. \n22  82.  The Senate formed a bipartisan special committee chaired by Democratic Senator \n23  Frank Church and Republican Senator Charles Mathias to reevaluate delegations of emergency \n24  authority to the President. \n25  83.  Among the more controversial statutes highlighted by the committee was the Trading \n26  with the Enemy Act. \n27  84.  This Act was originally enacted in 1917 to prevent trade with Germany and the \n28  Central Powers during World War I. \n \n  12   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 14 of 23\n \n1  85.  Over time, however, successive Presidents had invoked the Trading with the Enemy \n2  Act to declare that national emergencies existed and assume expansive authority over economic \n3  transactions outside the context of a declared war. \n4  86.  The 1970s bipartisan special committee reevaluating delegations of emergency \n5  authority to the President issued a report surveying the President’s emergency powers in which it \n6  asserted that the United States had technically “been in a state of national emergency since March \n7  9, 1933” and that there were four distinct declarations of national emergency then in effect. \n8  87.  The report also noted that the United States had “on the books at least 470 significant \n9  emergency statutes without time limitations delegating to the Executive extensive discretionary \n10  powers, ordinarily exercised by the Legislature, which affect the lives of American citizens in a \n11  host of all-encompassing ways.” \n12  88.  In the course of the committee’s investigations, Senator Mathias, a committee co-\n13  chair, noted, “A majority of the people of the United States have lived all of their lives under \n14  emergency government.” \n15  89.  Senator Church, the other co-chair, said the central question before the committee \n16  was “whether it [was] possible for a democratic government such as ours to exist under its present \n17  Constitution and system of three separate branches equal in power under a continued state of \n18  emergency.” \n19  90.  During the House markup of a bill revising the Trading with the Enemy Act, \n20  Representative Jonathan Bingham, Chairperson of the House International Relations Committee’s \n21  Subcommittee on Economic Policy, described the Act as conferring “on the President what could \n22  have been dictatorial powers that he could have used without any restraint by Congress.” \n23  91.  The House report on the reform legislation called the Trading with the Enemy Act \n24  “essentially an unlimited grant of authority for the President to exercise, at his discretion, broad \n25  powers in both the domestic and international economic arena, without congressional review.” \n26  92.  The report noted how Presidents had been claiming the ability to exercise powers \n27  under the Trading with the Enemy Act “so long as there is an unterminated declaration of national \n28  emergency on the books, whether or not the situation with respect to which the emergency was \n \n  13   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 15 of 23\n \n1  declared bears any relationship to the situation with respect to which the President is using the \n2  authorities.” \n3  93.  Congress’s reforms to this overly expansive use by Presidents of emergency powers \n4  came in two acts. \n5  94.  First, Congress enacted the National Emergencies Act in 1976. \n6  95.  The NEA provided for the termination of all existing declarations of national \n7  emergencies in 1978 and placed new restrictions on the President as to the manner of declaring \n8  and the duration of new states of emergency. \n9  96.  Second, Congress amended the Trading with the Enemy Act in 1977. \n10  97.  Among other things, Congress amended the Trading with the Enemy Act so that it \n11  was, as originally intended, only applicable “during a time of war.” \n12  98.  To address emergencies outside of wartime, Congress enacted the International \n13  Emergency Economic Powers Act to provide certain more limited economic powers for the \n14  President to use in genuine times of national emergency. \n15  99.  The Report of the House Committee on International Relations summarized the \n16  nature of an “emergency” in its new approach to international emergency economic powers: \n17  [G]iven the breadth of the authorities, and their availability at the \nPresident’s discretion upon a declaration of a national emergency, \n18  their exercise should be subject to various substantive restrictions.  \nThe main one stems from a recognition that emergencies are by their \n19  nature rare and brief, and are not to be equated with normal ongoing \nproblems.  A national emergency should be declared and emergency \n20  authorities  employed  only  with  respect  to  a  specific  set  of \ncircumstances which constitute a real emergency, and for no other \n21  purpose.  The emergency should be terminated in a timely manner \nwhen the factual state of emergency is over and not continued in \n22  effect for use in other circumstances.  A state of national emergency \nshould not be a normal state of affairs. \n23   \n100.  The Report further summarized how the amendments to the Trading with the Enemy \n24 \nAct and the new IEEPA statute were specifically intended to limit the ability of Presidents to \n25 \nexercise emergency powers unilaterally without proper oversight: \n26 \n[G]iven the history of expansive use of emergency powers, the \n27  exercise of the emergency economic authorities should also be \nsubject to strict procedural limitations, including consultation with \n28  Congress, periodic reporting requirements, and provision for \n \n  14   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 16 of 23\n \n1  termination of states of emergency by Congress and for veto by \nCongress  of  regulations  promulgated  under  the  international \n2  emergency economic powers statute.  This should be accomplished \nat a minimum by conforming the use of the authorities to the \n3  procedural requirements of the National Emergencies Act. \n \n4  C.  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act Does Not Authorize \nPresident Trump to Impose Tariffs \n5 \n101.  IEEPA does not provide clear congressional authorization for the President to impose \n6 \ntariffs. \n7 \n102.  Section 1702(a)(1)(B)—the section of IEEPA that President Trump cites—provides \n8 \nthat the President may “investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct \n9 \nand compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, \n10 \nwithdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, \n11 \npower, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign \n12 \ncountry or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect to any property, \n13 \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the United States[.]”  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  IEEPA further \n14 \nprovides that the President may exercise these authorities “only . . . to deal with an unusual and \n15 \nextraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of \n16 \nthis chapter” and “not . . . for any other purpose.”  50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). \n17 \n103.  This fulsome list of authorities does not include the power to impose tariffs, import \n18 \nduties, or taxes. \n19 \n104.  In the nearly 50-year history of IEEPA, no President has ever used IEEPA to impose \n20 \ntariffs, prior to the unprecedented actions of President Trump in 2025. \n21 \n105.  IEEPA further provides that “[t]he President, in every possible instance, shall consult \n22 \nwith the Congress before exercising any of the authorities granted by this chapter and shall \n23 \nconsult regularly with the Congress so long as such authorities are exercised.”  50 U.S.C. \n24 \n§ 1703(a). \n25 \n106.  Upon information and belief, President Trump did not consult with Congress before \n26 \nissuing his IEEPA Tariff Orders. \n27 \n107.  In contrast to IEEPA, which does not mention tariffs or import duties, other Acts of \n28 \n \n  15   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 17 of 23\n \n1  Congress do expressly mention import duties and authorize imposition of import duties.  See, e.g., \n2  19 U.S.C. § 2411. \n3  108.  Those Acts impose specific procedural requirements before the Executive Branch \n4  may impose a tariff, however. \n5  109.  Rather than comply with the statutory requirements that Congress established with \n6  respect to imposing tariffs, President Trump invoked IEEPA under the view that IEEPA granted \n7  him unfettered authority to impose unprecedented and staggering tariffs simply by decree. \n8  110.  The “economic and political significance” of the highly novel tariffs that President \n9  Trump has imposed is “staggering by any measure.”  Cf. Biden, 600 U.S. at 502.  And the \n10  proposed tariffs of such a scale represent an “unheralded” and “transformative expansion” of \n11  Presidential authority.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 724 (2022).   \n12  111.  As the Supreme Court has held, “[a] decision of such magnitude and consequence on \n13  a matter of earnest and profound debate across the country must rest with Congress itself, or an \n14  agency acting pursuant to a clear delegation from that representative body.”  Biden, 600 U.S. at \n15  504 (quotation marks and brackets omitted). \n16  112.  In such circumstances, the Executive Branch must have “clear congressional \n17  authorization” for the power it claims.  Id. at 506.   \n18  113.  IEEPA does not provide “clear” congressional authorization for President Trump to \n19  rule by fiat or to unilaterally impose the tariffs at issue in the IEEPA Tariff Orders. \n20  III.  President Trump’s Unprecedented Tariffs Inflict Harm on California and the \nGovernor of California \n21 \n114.  California, as the fifth largest economy in the world and the country’s most populous \n22 \nState, stands to suffer unique harm from President Trump’s reckless and unprecedented actions \n23 \non tariffs.   \n24 \n115.  California’s economy is larger than every country on earth except the United States, \n25 \nChina, Germany, and Japan.  With over 39 million residents, California is the second largest \n26 \neconomy in the world on a per capita basis.  It produced a gross state product (GSP) of over $4 \n27 \ntrillion in 2024, accounting for 13.7% of the entire U.S. gross domestic product (GDP).  \n28 \n \n  16   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 18 of 23\n \n1  116.  California is the largest importer and second-largest exporter among U.S. states.  In \n2  2024, California’s total merchandise trade reached $675 billion, accounting for close to 16% of \n3  GSP.  \n4  117.  Much of this trade flows through California’s eleven public ports, two of which are \n5  the largest and busiest container ports in North America.  California’s ports process one-third of \n6  all exports and 40% of all containerized imports for the entire world, generating an estimated $9 \n7  billion in state and local tax revenue annually.  \n8  118.  Mexico, Canada, and China, three countries specifically targeted by Trump’s current \n9  tariff regime, are California’s three largest trading partners.  Over 40% of California imports \n10  come from these countries, totaling $203 billion of the more than $491 billion in goods imported \n11  by California in 2024.  Additionally, these three countries are California’s top three export \n12  destinations, buying close to $67 billion in California exports, which was over one-third of the \n13  State’s $183 billion in exported goods in 2024.  \n14  119.  Because of California’s outsize economic footprint, it is subject to outsize effects \n15  from President Trump’s recent whipsaw actions on tariffs.   \n16  120.  Considering one aspect, the State of California spends a huge amount of money as a \n17  member of the global market.  These goods will or have already become more expensive as a \n18  direct result of President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders, resulting in drastic impacts on the State’s \n19  budget and the Governor’s ability to deliver on his policy goals.   \n20  121.  As a direct participant in the market, California enters into thousands of contracts \n21  every year that will be directly affected by President Trump’s tariffs: the costs of those contracts \n22  will go up, and those costs will be passed onto the State.  The State’s ability to plan for the future \n23  and enter into contracts with vendors has accordingly been hamstrung by the uncertainty and \n24  rapid-fire “emergency” nature of President Trump’s tariffs. \n25  122.  Multiple vendors that do business with California have claimed entitlement to pass on \n26  tariff-related price increases to the State, and more are expected to do so in the coming weeks and \n27  months. \n28  123.  These types of claims will only continue to multiply as President Trump’s IEEPA \n \n  17   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 19 of 23\n \n1  Tariff Orders continue to wreak havoc. \n2  124.  Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries in response to President Trump’s tariffs \n3  are also certain to impact California in unique and particularized ways.  California is the \n4  country’s second largest exporter, and ranks first in agricultural exports, which totaled over $23.6 \n5  billion in 2022. \n6  125.  For example, California grows 76% of the world’s almonds and exports most of \n7  them, contributing $9.2 billion to the State’s GSP and supporting 110,000 jobs.  If countries that \n8  import California’s almonds impose high retaliatory tariffs, almond producers will be responsible \n9  for the difference in price, and will have to choose to pay these costs themselves or pass them \n10  onto customers, thereby depressing demand for the product.  Either way, the State will miss out \n11  on tax revenue it currently collects, which will have a negative impact on its policy goals.  \n12  126.    California’s ports also stand to face drastic and industry-altering consequences from \n13  the President’s actions on tariffs.  The twelve ports in California, eleven of which are publicly \n14  owned, process approximately 40% of all containerized imports and 30% of all exports for the \n15  entire United States.  The ports generate an estimated $9 billion in state and local tax revenue \n16  annually.  Additionally, port activities employ more than half a million people in California and \n17  are linked to nearly three million jobs nationwide.  One in nine Southern California residents are \n18  employed through the ports.  \n19  127.  These ports are supported by various state agencies, and several were created through \n20  state statutes.  The State also directly supports the ports financially; for example, the State \n21  appropriated $27 million to support five ports in 2022.  The goal of President Trump’s tariffs is to \n22  impact trade; if left in place, they will undoubtedly cause decreased activity at the ports, resulting \n23  in untold consequences for the hundreds of thousands of Californians who work there.  It will also \n24  directly affect the State’s tax revenue, which relies on money from the ports to fund various \n25  programs.   \n26  128.  Furthermore, California is home to over 1.7 million businesses, which generate 90% \n27  of the State’s GSP.  Over 90% of those are small businesses, including 60,000 small-business \n28  exporters.   \n \n  18   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 20 of 23\n \n1  129.  Corporate taxes are California’s third-largest source of revenue—for 2024–2025, the \n2  State expects almost 15% of its $228.2 billion budget to be funded by corporate taxes.  As \n3  President’s Trump’s tariffs are projected to shrink the U.S. economy by $100 billion annually, \n4  millions of California’s businesses will see their profits decline, translating to diminished revenue \n5  to fund the State’s budget. \n6  130.  Additionally, projections also show the average American family will face increased \n7  costs of $2,100 on average, translating to a population with significantly decreased income and \n8  purchasing power.  These losses would in turn decrease personal-income-tax revenue, the State’s \n9  largest source of revenue, and sales and use taxes, the State’s second largest source of revenue, \n10  drastically impacting the State’s budget.   \n11  131.  The projected financial impacts from President Trump’s tariffs are also likely to raise \n12  the cost of State economic-assistance programs, such as unemployment and similar benefits.   \n13  132.  Finally, the tariffs also impede the Governor’s policy goals and his ability to \n14  effectuate the Legislature’s priorities. \n15  133.  All told, President Trump’s tariffs will transform the State of California’s economic \n16  situation, put at risk its position as the fifth largest economy in the world, and directly impact \n17  Governor Newsom’s ability to deliver on his policy goals for all Californians.  \n18  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n19  COUNT I \nUltra Vires - Conduct in Excess of Statutory Authority \n20  (Against All Defendants) \n21  134.  Plaintiffs incorporate each and every one of the preceding allegations as if alleged \n22  herein. \n23  135.  President Trump has claimed a wholly unconstrained authority to unilaterally impose \n24  unprecedented tariffs on every single trading partner of the United States. \n25  136.  The President does not have the authority to act unilaterally. \n26  137.  Rather, “[t]he President’s power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an \n27  act of Congress or from the Constitution itself.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. \n28  138.  President Trump cites IEEPA as the statutory authority for his tariffs. \n \n  19   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 21 of 23\n \n1  139.  IEEPA does not authorize President Trump to issue the IEEPA Tariff Orders. \n2  140.  Accordingly, President Trump’s conduct in issuing the IEEPA Tariff Orders has been \n3  ultra vires. \n4  141.  Agency Defendants’ conduct in implementing the tariffs that President Trump has \n5  imposed has been ultra vires. \n6  142.  Defendants’ ultra vires conduct has caused and will continue to cause ongoing, \n7  irreparable harm to California, its Governor, and its residents. \n8  143.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the IEEPA \n9  Tariff Orders are unlawful, void, and of no effect.  \n10  144.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n11  enjoining all Defendants (other than the President) and their officers, employees, agents, servants, \n12  attorneys, and others acting in concert with them or subject to their control or direction, from \n13  implementing or enforcing the IEEPA Tariff Orders. \n14  COUNT II \nSeparation of Powers – Usurping Legislative Authority \n15  (Against All Defendants) \n16  145.  Plaintiffs incorporate the preceding allegations as if alleged herein. \n17  146.  The separation-of-powers doctrine is “foundational” and “evident from the \n18  Constitution’s vesting of certain powers in certain bodies.”  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n19  197, 227 (2020). \n20  147.  The Constitution provides that “Congress shall have the Power To lay and collect \n21  Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises . . . .”  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8. \n22  148.  Congress’s power in this area is exhaustive.  Brushaber, 240 U.S. at 12 (“the \n23  authority conferred upon Congress by § 8 of article 1 ‘to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and \n24  excises’ is exhaustive and embraces every conceivable power of taxation”).   \n25  149.  “The President’s power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an act of \n26  Congress or from the Constitution itself.”  Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. \n27  150.  Where, as here, the President or the Executive Branch usurps and exercises a power \n28  that the Constitution has vested in Congress that Congress has not validly granted them, it \n \n  20   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 22 of 23\n \n1  violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. \n2  151.  Accordingly, President Trump’s conduct in issuing the IEEPA Tariff Orders violates \n3  the separation-of-powers doctrine. \n4  152.  Agency Defendants’ conduct in implementing the tariffs that President Trump has \n5  imposed violates the separation-of-powers doctrine. \n6  153.  Defendants’ unconstitutional conduct has caused and will continue to cause ongoing, \n7  irreparable harm to California, its Governor, and its residents. \n8  154.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, Plaintiffs are entitled to a declaration that the IEEPA \n9  Tariff Orders are unlawful, void, and of no effect.  \n10  155.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02, Plaintiffs are entitled to injunctive relief, \n11  enjoining all Defendants (other than the President) and their officers, employees, agents, servants, \n12  attorneys, and others acting in concert with them or subject to their control or direction, from \n13  implementing or enforcing the IEEPA Tariff Orders. \n14  PRAYER FOR RELIEF \n15  WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs State of California, by and through Attorney General Rob Bonta, \n16  and Gavin Newsom, in his official capacity as Governor of California, respectfully request that \n17  this Court: \n18  1.  Declare that President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders are unlawful and void, because \n19  they were issued ultra vires in excess of statutory authority and/or because they are \n20  unconstitutional and violate separation of powers, pursuant to the Declaratory Judgment Act, \n21  28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–02; \n22  2.  Enjoin Agency Defendants (and all of their officers, employees, agents, servants, \n23  attorneys, and others acting in concert with them or subject to their control or direction) from \n24  taking any action to implement or enforce President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders; \n25  3.  Award Plaintiffs costs, expenses, and reasonable attorney’s fees, pursuant to the \n26  Equal Access to Justice Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2412; and \n27  4.  Grant such other relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n28   \n \n  21   \n \nComplaint (No. 25-cv-__________) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372     Document 1     Filed 04/16/25     Page 23 of 23\n \n1  Dated:  April 16, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n2  ROB BONTA \nAttorney General of California \n3  THOMAS S.

In Asia, the United States tactfully brokered a ceasefire in an \n4  escalating confrontation between two nuclear powers, India and Pakistan. The United States is also \n5  navigating and addressing a range of extremely consequential threats from strategic acquisitions to naval \n6  drills to the export of deadly substances. The success of the Nation, in these endeavors and into the future, \n7  is built off the dispatch of the Executive, girded by necessary tools.     \n8  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) is one of those critical tools—giving \n9  the President the broad and flexible tools to handle complex, delicate, and high-stakes foreign relations \n10  and to protect the United States from foreign threats. Invoking IEEPA, President Trump found two types \n11  of unusual and extraordinary threats to the United States’s national security, economy, and foreign policy; \n12  declared national emergencies as to these threats; and imposed tariffs to deal with these emergencies. With \n13  the leverage the President has created in this delicate, complex, and intertwined sphere of foreign relations, \n14  the President has already achieved many successes and is on the brink of achieving more. See, e.g., Lutnick \n15  Decl. ¶¶ 7-12. Any judicial interference with these sensitive matters would be unprecedented, unravel the \n16  progress the President has achieved, and hurl the United States into further danger.  \n17  Plaintiffs dispute none of this. They tacitly concede that President Trump correctly identified the \n18  emergencies and correctly found the threats to be unusual and extraordinary. They tacitly concede that \n19  President Trump’s chosen means are effectively dealing with the declared emergencies. And they cannot \n20  meaningfully dispute that interfering with the President’s actions would have cascading and devastating \n21  consequences to the United States, as declarations from four cabinet members explain. \n22  Still, plaintiffs seek to deny the President a critical tool that, in his judgment, is necessary to deal \n23  with these concededly real and extraordinary emergencies and cause catastrophic harm to the United \n24  States’s national security, economy, and foreign policy. This Court should deny plaintiffs’ preliminary-\n25  injunction request for several independent reasons. This Court lacks jurisdiction to adjudicate this case \n26  because the Court of International (CIT) has exclusive jurisdiction over these matters, and in any event, \n27  plaintiffs have not established standing. IEEPA’s text, history, and purpose clearly show that the phrase \n28  “regulate … importation” includes the authority to impose tariffs. And the equities strongly favor \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP.

INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  1 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 12 of 36\n \n1  defendants, especially given that plaintiffs delayed in suing and moving for a preliminary injunction. \n2  First, as defendants explained in their transfer motion, the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over this \n3  case. Docs. 9, 14. Defendants’ position has been confirmed by a recent CIT decision concluding it has \n4  exclusive jurisdiction over a similar challenge, Doc. 15 at 5-10, Barnes v. United States, No. 25-00043 \n5  (CIT May 23, 2025) (Barnes), two district-court decisions transferring similar challenges to the CIT, \n6  Webber v. DHS, 2025 WL 1207587 (D. Mont. Apr. 25); Doc. 35-1, Emily Ley Paper, Inc. v. Trump (N.D. \n7  Fla. May 20, 2025) (Emily Ley), and statements by the three-judge panel of the CIT indicating they view \n8  the CIT as the sole forum to adjudicate these IEEPA suits, V.O.S. Tr. 5:25-6:3 (Attachment); Oregon Oral \n9  Arg. at 20:30-22:03, 1:41:48-1:41:56, www.cit.uscourts.gov/sites/cit/files/20250521-25-00077-3JP.mp3. \n10  Regardless, both California and its Governor lack standing to challenge tariffs that they never \n11  claim to have paid. Plaintiffs show no cognizable injury but at best, alleges speculative injuries not fairly \n12  traceable to the challenged IEEPA tariffs or redressable by enjoining these tariffs. \n13  Second,  though  plaintiffs  concede  that  the  President  is  effectively  addressing  the  declared \n14  emergencies through the challenged tariffs, plaintiffs argue that IEEPA is an emergency statute that \n15  somehow does not give the President the power the President has determined is necessary to address the \n16  declared emergencies. Per California, IEEPA gives the President greater powers like imposing an \n17  embargo or quota on foreign imports but does not give him the lesser and more flexible power to impose \n18  tariffs to leverage foreign countries and to directly affect the importation of illicit drugs into the United \n19  States that created a public-health crisis or the untenable trade deficit that has ravaged the United States’s \n20  manufacturing capacity, access to critical supply chains, and the defense-industrial base.  \n21  Text, context, history, and purpose all say otherwise. IEEPA’s use of “regulate … importation” \n22  clearly authorizes the President to impose tariffs. 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B). The Federal Circuit’s \n23  predecessor interpreted identical language in IEEPA’s predecessor to authorize tariffs. United States v. \n24  Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d 560, 575-76 (C.C.P.A. 1975). Congress knew of this holding when it chose \n25  to adopt the identical language in IEEPA and incorporate that interpretation in IEEPA. That is confirmed \n26  by the long line of cases concluding that tariffs are a form of regulating importation and that emergency \n27  statutes, especially those like IEEPA that involve national security and foreign affairs, must be read \n28  broadly to ensure that the President has the flexibility necessary to successfully address emergencies.

That is why it is unsurprising that the Ninth Circuit has already concluded that \n2  identical language in TWEA “clearly shows” that Congress  “unambiguously authorized” President \n3  Nixon’s tariffs. United States v. Spawr Optical Rsch., Inc., 685 F.2d 1076, 1081 n.10 (9th Cir. 1982). \n4  Finally, the other preliminary-injunction factors weigh emphatically against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs \n5  fail to show any imminent irreparable harm, let alone harm before this Court could adjudicate this case on \n6  the merits: At most, plaintiffs allege speculative economic loss, loss vitiated by the fact that plaintiffs \n7  waited months to file their preliminary-injunction motion.  \n8  The equities and public interest profoundly favor the government and compel denying the motion. \n9  Four cabinet members have submitted declarations explaining the devastating foreign-policy and national-\n10  security consequences of issuing a preliminary injunction. The Secretary of State warns that a preliminary \n11  injunction “would cause significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security” and \n12  “threaten broader U.S. strategic interests internationally.” Rubio Decl. ¶ 3. The U.S. Trade Representative \n13  notes that an injunction will cause a “foreign policy disaster scenario.” Greer Decl. ¶ 12. The Commerce \n14  Secretary has stated that an injunction “would destroy” a carefully negotiated agreement with China and \n15  “severely disrupt the Department of Commerce’s coordination of foreign policy-related economic actions \n16  on behalf of the President.” Lutnick Decl. ¶¶ 15, 19. And the Treasury Secretary adds that an injunction \n17  will  threaten  to  “shatter  our  negotiations  with  dozens  of  countries”  to  address  national-security \n18  emergencies, creating an immediate risk that our trading partners “feel a renewed boldness to take \n19  advantage of” a perceived “new vulnerability by retaliating against the United States.” Bessent Decl. \n20  ¶¶ 10-11. \n21  In short, a preliminary injunction threatens to undo more than a month of intensive negotiations in \n22  pursuit of a top foreign policy priority that has been the focus of much of the country’s global diplomacy \n23  over the last six weeks. That would create a foreign policy disaster, signal to our trading partners and \n24  adversaries that the United States is vulnerable to retaliation, and threaten the country’s national security \n25  during declared and uncontested national emergencies. Those compelling equities alone warrant denying \n26  a preliminary injunction without even reaching the merits. See Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 23-28 (2008).  \n27  At the very least, it is imperative to stay any relief against the United States to maintain the status \n28  quo and avoid interfering with delicate and complex international diplomacy while the United States seeks \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

The President’s Authority To Regulate Importation During National Emergencies \n5  Before IEEPA, the Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA), Pub. L. No. 65-91, 40 Stat. 411 (1917), \n6  as amended by the First War Powers Act, Pub. L. No. 77-354, 55 Stat. 838, 839-40 (1941), authorized the \n7  President to “regulate … importation” of foreign goods during war or a national emergency. In 1971, \n8  President Nixon invoked this authority to impose tariffs during peacetime to address a balance-of-\n9  payments deficit that threatened the United States’s economy and national security. Procl. 4074, 36 Fed. \n10  Reg. 15,724 (Aug. 17, 1971); H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 5 (1977). The Federal Circuit’s predecessor upheld \n11  the lawfulness of those tariffs, rejecting an argument that “regulate … importation” in TWEA did not \n12  authorize the President to impose tariffs. Yoshida., 526 F.2d at 575-76. \n13  Later, Congress modified TWEA through IEEPA. Congress limited TWEA to apply only during \n14  declared wars. See 50 U.S.C. § 4302. Congress through IEEPA then extended the President’s authority to \n15  periods of declared national emergencies during peacetime. See Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 227-28 \n16  (1984). The broad powers granted to the President under IEEPA are “essentially the same as” those under \n17  TWEA. Id. IEEPA’s operative language was “directly drawn” from TWEA. Dames & Moore v. Regan, \n18  453 U.S. 654, 671-72 (1981). IEEPA authorizes the President to exercise those powers “to deal with any \n19  unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United \n20  States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a). If \n21  the President declares a national emergency relating to such a threat, IEEPA empowers the President to \n22  “regulate … importation … with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” \n23  § 1702(a)(1)(B). Unlike TWEA, IEEPA provides exceptions to this broad authority, but none of those \n24  exceptions bars the President from imposing tariffs. § 1702(b)(1)-(4). \n25  II.  Factual Background \n26  A.  Mexico and Canada Executive Orders \n27  In January 2025, the President declared the flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl and the resulting \n28  public-health crisis to be a national emergency. Procl. 10886, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,327 (Jan. 29, 2025). On \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  4 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 15 of 36\n \n1  February 1, the President found that the actions of Canada and Mexico contributed to this crisis. E.O. \n2  14193, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,113, 9,114 (Feb. 7, 2025); E.O. 14194, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117, 9,118 (Feb. 7, 2025). \n3  Using IEEPA, the President is dealing with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the United States, by \n4  ordering a 25-percent duty on most Canadian and Mexican imports. E.O. 14193, 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,114; \n5  E.O. 14194, 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,118. \n6  On February 3, the President recognized that Canada and Mexico had taken immediate steps to \n7  alleviate their role in the emergency, but finding that additional time was needed to assess those steps’ \n8  sufficiency and thus pausing most of the tariffs until March 4. E.O. 14197, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,183 (Feb. 10, \n9  2025); E.O. 14198, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,185 (Feb. 10, 2025). Shortly after that pause lapsed, the President \n10  exempted all Canadian and Mexican goods that qualify for duty-free entry under the United States-\n11  Mexico-Canada Agreement. E.O. 14231, 90 Fed. Reg. 11,785 (Mar. 11, 2025); E.O. 14232, 90 Fed. Reg. \n12  11,787 (Mar. 11, 2025). As a result, most Canadian and Mexican goods are not subject to these tariffs.  \n13  B.  China Executive Orders \n14  On February 1, the President invoked IEEPA to address an unusual and extraordinary threat from \n15  the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including the PRC’s failure to stem the flow of contraband drugs \n16  to the United States. E.O. 14195, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,121 (Feb. 7, 2025). To address the national emergency, \n17  the President imposed a 10-percent tariff on most goods imported from the PRC. Id. at 9,122-23. The \n18  President later raised the duty to 20 percent and imposed tariffs on low-value imports, as smugglers try to \n19  hide illicit substances with these seemingly lawful imports. E.O. 14228, 90 Fed. Reg. 11,463 (Mar. 7, \n20  2025); E.O. 14256, 90 Fed. Reg. 14,899 (Apr. 7, 2025).  \n21  C.  Reciprocal Tariff Executive Orders \n22  On April 2, the President declared a national emergency, finding “that underlying conditions, \n23  including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff \n24  barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as \n25  indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary \n26  threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” E.O. 14257, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 (Apr. \n27  7, 2025). In particular, the President found, these “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits” \n28  have “atrophied” our nation’s “domestic production capacity” to the point where, now, the United States’s \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

The President found that “[t]he future \n3  of American competitiveness depends on reversing” the hemorrhage of manufacturing and manufacturing \n4  jobs to create “the industrial base” America “needs for national security,” as well as safeguarding the \n5  vitality of the Nation’s food and agriculture sectors. Id. at 15,044. \n6  Invoking IEEPA, the President is dealing with this unusual and extraordinary threat to the United \n7  States’s national security and economy, through a 10-percent duty on most imported goods. Id. at 15,045. \n8  These duties took effect on April 5, 2025, with select countries having additional duties imposed on April \n9  9. Id. Since the initial declaration, the President has taken additional actions to address this emergency, \n10  including raising the duty rate for Chinese products and pausing the country-specific duties for 90 days \n11  for countries that he determined to have taken meaningful steps to negotiate and align with the United \n12  States’s interests. E.O. 14266, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,625 (Apr. 15, 2025); E.O. 14259, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,509 \n13  (Apr. 14, 2025). More recently, the additional tariffs imposed on China were “suspend[ed]” for 90 days \n14  “[i]n recognition of the intentions of the PRC to facilitate addressing th[is] national emergency.”  E.O. \n15  14298, 90 Fed. Reg. 21,831 (May 21, 2025).  \n16  The 10-percent duty on most imported goods imposed on April 5, and the additional country-\n17  specific duties starting on April 9, do not currently apply to Canadian or Mexican goods. E.O. 14257, 90 \n18  Fed. Reg. at 15,041 (Apr. 7, 2025). The President’s actions have opened discussions with trading partners \n19  on solutions that will strengthen our country. Bessent Decl. ¶¶ 6-8; Greer Decl. ¶¶ 7-9; Lutnick Decl. ¶¶ 7-\n20  12; Rubio Decl. ¶¶ 8-9. “[M]ore than 75 … foreign trading partners … have approached the United States \n21  to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationships and our resulting national and \n22  economic security concerns.” E.O. 14266, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,625.  \n23  D.  Plaintiffs Sue to Enjoin Enforcement of the Executive Orders \n24  Months after the first Executive Orders, Plaintiffs, the State of California and Governor Gavin \n25  Newsom, sued on April 16, and moved for a preliminary injunction on May 13—nearly a month later. \n26  Compl., Doc. 1; Mot., Doc. 15. In their motion, plaintiffs do not question the President’s emergency \n27  declarations, threat determinations, or the wisdom of the President’s action. See Mot. Instead, they argue \n28  only that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs on imports. Id. 8-20.  \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM.

Armstrong, 520 U.S. \n4  968, 972 (1997). Plaintiffs must show they are “likely to succeed on the merits” and are “likely to suffer \n5  irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,” “the balance of equities tips in” their favor, and that \n6  “an injunction is in the public interest.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. Plaintiffs satisfy none of the factors.  \n7  ARGUMENT \n8  I.  Plaintiffs Fail To Show A Likelihood That This Court Has Jurisdiction \n9  A.  The CIT Has Exclusive Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Action Challenging Tariffs \n10  As explained in defendants’ motion to transfer, the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ \n11  civil action challenging the imposition of tariffs, and this Court consequently lacks subject-matter \n12  jurisdiction. Docs. 9, 14. The CIT itself has recognized its exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to these \n13  orders. Barnes at 5-10. Two other district courts have reached that same conclusion in materially identical \n14  challenges to the IEEPA tariffs challenged here, and no court has reached a contrary conclusion. Webber, \n15  2025 WL 1207587; Emily Ley. Indeed, Emily Ley considered and rejected many of the same arguments \n16  against the CIT’s jurisdiction that plaintiffs make here: that IEEPA “does not refer to tariffs,” that “the \n17  authority to ‘regulate’ imports does not include the authority [impose] tariffs,” that “IEEPA is unlike other \n18  tariffs laws,” and that the “‘major questions’ doctrine” precluded interpreting IEEPA to include the power \n19  to impose tariffs. Id. at 11. “None of these arguments are persuasive,” the court concluded, “at least insofar \n20  as they implicate the jurisdictional question framed by Defendants’ motion to transfer.” Id. Twelve other \n21  States have also recognized that the “Court [of International Trade] has subject-matter jurisdiction” over \n22  litigation challenging these orders. Oregon v. Trump, No. 1:25-cv-77, Doc. 2 at 4 (CIT Apr. 23, 2025).  \n23  This Court should likewise conclude that it lacks jurisdiction and plaintiffs’ suit belongs at the CIT \n24  and deny the motion. Sires v. Washington, 314 F.2d 883, 884 (9th Cir. 1963) (a district court lacking \n25  jurisdiction “may not entertain an application for an injunction”). \n26  B.  Plaintiffs Lack Standing To Challenge Tariffs That They Have Not Paid \n27  Standing is “an essential and unchanging part of the case-or-controversy requirement of Article \n28  III,” which plaintiffs “bear[] the burden of establishing.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  7 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 18 of 36\n \n1  (1992). Plaintiffs here have not even tried to bear that burden for Governor Newsom, who thus lacks \n2  standing to bring any claims here. See Guenther v. Cooper Life Scis., 759 F. Supp. 1437, 1441 (N.D. Cal. \n3  1990); Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 61 (2024) (“standing is not dispensed in gross”); Colo. Outfitters \n4  Ass’n v. Hickenlooper, 823 F.3d 537, 544 (10th Cir. 2016) (“we consider only those arguments in favor of \n5  standing that the parties have adequately briefed”); Ctr. for Bio. Diversity v. EPA, 937 F.3d 533, 542 (5th \n6  Cir. 2019) (“Arguments in favor of standing … can be forfeited.”). For its part, plaintiffs try but fail to \n7  meet their burden for the State.  \n8  Injury In Fact: California does not establish a concrete harm that is “actual or imminent, not \n9  conjectural or hypothetical.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (cleaned up). California alleges price increases, Mot. \n10  7, but fails to show actual or imminent concrete harm. The Shell Declaration, for example, says “some” \n11  vendors have “indicat[ed] a desire” to increase prices, Shell Decl. ¶ 9—but does not say that vendors have \n12  actually done so. It likewise describes a handful of price increase “requests,” id. ¶ 11—but makes clear \n13  that such requests are subject to California’s “approv[al],” id. ¶ 10. And if California refuses the requests, \n14  there are still more contingencies—vendors “may refuse” to perform the contracts, and the State “may” \n15  lose access to goods. Id. ¶ 15; see Bignami Decl. ¶ 7 (“if” products become more expensive, “there could \n16  be” impacts on public health programs because the increase “might” exceed the budget and there could \n17  be “possible” supply chain impacts). Similarly, California offers a “simulat[ion]” of “potential” increased \n18  costs. York Decl. ¶ 61. These speculative assertions are not sufficient. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560; Clapper v. \n19  Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410-18 (2013).1  \n20  Even if California’s evidence were stronger, it would still be insufficient as a matter of law. \n21  “Federal policies frequently generate indirect effects on state revenues or state spending.” United States \n22  v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 680 n.3 (2023). But courts regularly and properly reject the idea that such common \n23  and peripheral effects suffice to give a state standing. See id.; Arizona v. Biden, 40 F.4th 375, 386 (6th Cir. \n24  2022) (“Are we really going to say that any federal regulation … that imposes peripheral costs on a State \n25 \n26   \n1 California also cites a declaration discussing harms to “California consumers” and “workers and firms \n27  in California.” Clausing Decl. at 7-19. Such harms cannot confer standing even if established, because \nStates lack standing as parens patriae to sue based on their citizens’ interests. Murthy, 603 U.S. at 76; \n28 \nHaaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 294-95 (2023). \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM.

Cir. 1976) (“virtually all federal policies” carry “unavoidable economic \n5  repercussions,” suggesting that “impairment of state tax revenues should not, in general, be … sufficient \n6  injury in fact to support state standing.”); Louisiana v. DHS, 726 F. Supp. 3d 653, 675 (E.D. La. 2024) \n7  (“claimed economic injuries in the form of a reduction in their ad valorem tax collections”). \n8  The  allegations’  speculative  nature  also  makes  plaintiffs’  cited  cases  inapposite.  The  “lost \n9  opportunity” injury in Louisiana v. Dep’t of Energy, 90 F.4th 461, 467 (5th Cir. 2024), occurred because a \n10  regulation precluded any opportunity to buy certain products. The challenged tariffs here do not preclude \n11  the opportunity to buy imported products, and California does not establish that it has lost any such \n12  opportunity. Becker v.  Skype  Inc., 2014 WL 556697, at *2 (N.D. Cal. Feb. 10) (rejecting “vague \n13  suggestions of lost opportunity,” where plaintiff “provide[d] no allegations relating to any specific work \n14  he set aside or was forced to forgo”). Likewise, the D.C. Circuit has explained that “lost opportunity” \n15  injury looks to “whether the challenged action made a consumer’s desired product … not readily available, \n16  and whether it rendered the product unreasonably priced.” Weissman v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 21 \n17  F.4th 854, 858 (D.C. Cir. 2021); see Orangeburg v. FERC, 862 F.3d 1071, 1078 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Again, \n18  California does not establish either factor. \n19  Traceability And Redressability: California also cannot show that its alleged injuries are “fairly \n20  traceable to the challenged action” and “redress[able] by a favorable decision,” Lujan 504 U.S. at 560-61, \n21  for at least two reasons. First, California’s declarations describe the effect of tariffs generally. But this \n22  action does not challenge all tariffs; it challenges only certain tariffs imposed under IEEPA. Compl. ¶ 1. \n23  California fails to trace the alleged price increases and tax-revenue effects to the challenged IEEPA tariffs. \n24  Mot. 7-8; see Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 495 (2009) (no standing where harm alleged \n25  was “not tied to application of the challenged regulations”). In fact, California’s own evidence reveals that \n26  its claimed harms flow from unchallenged tariffs on steel, aluminum, automobiles, and other products that \n27 \n28 \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP.

See Barnes at 15 (plaintiff \n11  merely “concerned by the possibility that costs of goods will increase” because of IEEPA tariffs is “not a \n12  member of a group that may have a particularized injury, such as importers”). Just the opposite; California \n13  admits importers are third-party “vendors and suppliers or their subcontractors.” Shell Decl. ¶ 14. As a \n14  purchaser, not an importer, California “ha[s] no remedy to challenge” a tariff because its alleged injury—\n15  increased prices—results from independent action by the third-party vendors who set their own prices. \n16  Totes-Isotoner Corp. v. United States, 594 F.3d 1346, 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2010); see Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560; \n17  Pritikin v. Dep’t of Energy, 254 F.3d 791, 800-01 (9th Cir. 2001) (no traceability or redressability where \n18  third parties were “the direct source” of the asserted injury). California argues that vendors are increasing \n19  their prices “due to tariffs,” Mot. 7, but its own declarant admits that “each vendor may pass along the \n20  additional cost of the new tariffs in different ways” and “it may not be administratively possible … to \n21  review every purchase made under every agreement to determine the tariff impact,” Shell Decl. ¶¶ 16-17.  \n22  California’s admission is consistent with market realities. Prices are set by independent private \n23  actors and informed by multiple, complex market forces. California cannot reasonably infer that importers \n24  will uniformly pass on not just costs but also any savings (like duty refunds or post-tariff price decreases) \n25  to consumers—let alone to the State specifically. Indeed, even if the Court were to grant injunctive relief, \n26  vendors may retain higher prices for any number of reasons independent of the IEEPA tariffs.

SEC, 963 F.3d \n10  244, 252-53 (2d Cir. 2020) (no state standing based on prospect of decreased tax revenue, as tax revenue \n11  “is driven by countless variables”). \n12  Strikingly, California addresses traceability and redressability in just two conclusory sentences. \n13  Mot. 8. The sole case it cites on traceability and redressability concerned “the violation of a procedural \n14  right,” which can be asserted “without meeting all the normal standards for traceability and redressability.” \n15  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571 (9th Cir. 2018) (cleaned up). But California has not asserted any \n16  procedural harm and must abide by “the normal standards for traceability and redressability.” Id.  \n17  Fundamentally, plaintiffs’ theory of standing is that any governmental regulation that might \n18  increase costs for downstream purchasers causes a judicially redressable injury in fact traceable to that \n19  regulation. But if that were true, “everyone would have standing to litigate about everything.” Burnett v. \n20  Convergent Outsourcing, Inc., 982 F.3d 1067, 1068 (7th Cir. 2020). Plaintiffs are thus unlikely to succeed \n21  in showing their standing to challenge the IEEPA tariffs.  \n22  II.  Plaintiffs Fail To Show Likely Success On The Merits Because IEEPA Clearly Includes \nTariff Authority \n23 \n24  The President imposed the challenged tariffs under the authority granted to him by IEEPA to \n25  “regulate … importation” to deal with a national emergency. 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B). The Ninth Circuit \n26  has already held that the identical language in TWEA “clearly shows” that Congress “unambiguously \n27  authorized” President Nixon’s tariffs. Spawr, 685 F.2d at 1081 n.10.

IEEPA’s plain text authorizes the President to impose tariffs. If a national \n3  emergency is declared: \n4  [T]he President may, under such regulations as he may prescribe, by means of instructions, \nlicenses, or otherwise … investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, \n5 \nregulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, \nwithholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or \n6 \ndealing in … any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any \ninterest by any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the \n7 \nUnited States. \n8 \n9  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B) (emphases added). Imposing tariffs falls within the power to “regulate … \n10  importation” of foreign goods. Id. Tariffs set the terms on which foreign goods enter the United States. \n11  That is consistent with the definition of “regulate.” See Regulate, Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (5th ed. \n12  1979) (“[F]ix, establish or control; to adjust by rule, method, or established mode; to direct by rule or \n13  restriction; to subject to governing principles or laws”).  \n14    Precedent  confirms  this  straightforward  reading.  Interpreting  identical  relevant  language  in \n15  TWEA, the Federal Circuit’s predecessor upheld a tariff imposed by President Nixon, explaining that the \n16  phrase “regulate importation” permitted the President to “impos[e] an import duty surcharge.” Yoshida, \n17  526 F.2d at 576; accord Alcan Sales v. United States, 693 F.2d 1089, 1093 (Fed. Cir. 1982); Spawr, 685 \n18  F.2d at 1081 n.10. Courts have likewise long held that tariffs are a form of regulation of commerce. See, \n19  e.g., Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.S. 48, 58 (1933) (“well established” that import \n20  duties are an “exercise of the power to regulate commerce”); Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. 1, 202 (1824) \n21  (“[D]uties … in fact often are[] imposed … with a view to the regulation of commerce[.]”); Yoshida, 526 \n22  F.2d at 575 n.20 (“it is well established that” the power to “lay duties upon imports” “can be employed in \n23  the exercise” of “the power to regulate commerce” (collecting cases)); id. at 575 (“to impose duties can \n24  be to ‘regulate’”); Cornet Stores v. Morton, 632 F.2d 96, 99 (9th Cir. 1980) (“principal purpose of the \n25  surcharge was the regulation of imports”). This makes sense: a tariff controls importation “as much as a \n26  quota,” because both actions have “initial and direct impact on imports.” Fed. Energy Admin. v. Algonquin \n27  SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 571 (1976). Rather than tie the President’s hands, Congress clearly granted the \n28  President flexibility to determine what action to take to address an emergency, including choosing an \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  12 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 23 of 36\n \n1  import control that, “[u]nlike quotas and other forms of action,” can “be quickly imposed and removed” \n2  and is “administratively less complex.” Id. at 580. \n3    Statutory context reinforces this conclusion. The power to “regulate” imports by imposing tariffs \n4  is similar to the other powers granted in § 1702(a)(1)(B), like the power to “block” the import of goods \n5  during an investigation, or the power to “prevent or prohibit” those imports. Each term grants the President \n6  a significant power over foreign commerce. And many partially or fully overlap, suggesting that Congress \n7  entrusted the President with wide-ranging powers with respect to imports rather than carefully picking \n8  and choosing isolated types of interventions. For example, the provision’s list of powers includes two \n9  obvious pairs of belt-and-suspenders terms: “direct and compel” and “prevent or prohibit.” Id. It confers \n10  the overlapping powers to “nullify” and “void” various transactions. Id. Similarly, the power to “prevent \n11  or prohibit” imports could be used to “block” imports during an investigation, but the statute goes out of \n12  its way to grant both powers. Id. \n13    Attempting to read § 1702(a)(1)(B)’s list as enumerating discrete powers instead of providing \n14  broad Presidential authority would lead to the same conclusion about “regulation.” If each power \n15  articulated in the list is distinct, then “regulation” of imports must include actions such as tariffs; \n16  otherwise, it would mean little, if anything, other than the power to “prevent or prohibit” imports—leaving \n17  the term largely superfluous. See, e.g., Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141-43 (2024) (rejecting \n18  reading that would leave a provision “without any operative significance”).  \n19  Plaintiffs seek to narrow IEEPA’s plain text by arguing that “regulate” cannot mean “tax.” Mot. 8-\n20  11. That argument ignores the longstanding contrary authority just discussed. And plaintiffs do not offer \n21  any real examples of what regulating imports could mean other than the power to impose tariffs, fees, or \n22  similar monetary exactions. At best, plaintiffs argue that “regulate” might mean to “limit[] the times when \n23  imports can be brought in” or to “subject[] them to inspection,” Mot. 10, but IEEPA already delegates to \n24  the President the power to “investigate” and “prevent or prohibit” importation “by means of instructions” \n25  or “otherwise.” Again, “regulate” cannot simply mean to “investigate” or to “prevent or prohibit” under \n26  particular “instructions.” See, e.g., Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141-43.  \n27  Plaintiffs’ suggestion that it would be odd to describe exactions imposed on undesirable conduct \n28  as “regulation” of that conduct, Mot. 10, also misses the mark. The question is not what “regulate” means \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  13 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 24 of 36\n \n1  in isolation, but rather what “regulate … importation” means—and precedent is clear that it includes \n2  imposing tariffs. More generally, though, the verb “regulate” comfortably encompasses imposing fees to \n3  discourage or steer consumption. Authorities also commonly “regulate” the examples of conduct that \n4  plaintiffs give (like pollution) by imposing monetary exactions.3  \n5  Indeed, Congress understands that tariffs “regulate” importation because that is how it describes \n6  tariffs in non-emergency trade statutes. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, for instance, \n7  delegates to the Executive Branch the power to “adjust … imports” to protect national security, 19 U.S.C. \n8  § 1862(c), which the Supreme Court has explained includes the power to impose “monetary exactions” \n9  like “license fees and duties” on imports, Algonquin, 426 U.S. at 562. Section 232 “clearly … grant[ed] \n10  [the President] a measure of discretion in determining the method to be used to adjust imports.”  Id. at \n11  561.  There was “no support in the language of the statute for [the] contention that the authorization to the \n12  President to ‘adjust’ imports should be read to encompass only … quotas as opposed to monetary \n13  methods.”  Id.  And elsewhere in that same Act, as well as in the Trade Act of 1974, Congress defined the \n14  phrase “duty or other import restriction” as encompassing not just duties but also “exaction[s] other than \n15  dut[ies]” that are “imposed for the regulation of imports.” 19 U.S.C. §§ 1806(2), 2481(2) (emphasis \n16  added). Regulating importation thus includes the power to impose tariffs. \n17  Finally, plaintiffs say “regulate … importation” must not include tariff authority because the IEEPA \n18  power to “regulate … exportation” cannot include tariff authority. Mot. 11. That makes no sense, which \n19  is why no other challenger to these IEEPA tariffs has made the argument. Statutory language must be read \n20  in context (as plaintiffs agree, id. 9), and the verb “regulate” requires an object “to express a complete \n21  thought.” TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 507 F. Supp. 3d 92, 103 (D.D.C. 2020); QBE Syndicate 1036 v. Compass \n22  Mins. Louisiana, Inc., 95 F.4th 984, 995 (5th Cir. 2024) (transitive verbs “require an object to complete \n23  the thought”). Thus, there is nothing inconsistent about reading the phrase “regulate importation” to \n24  include the power to impose tariffs but reading the phrase “regulate exportation” to convey a different set \n25 \n \n26  3 On that note, plaintiffs complain that a plain reading of “regulate” would too broadly permit the President \nto tax acquisitions, holdings, withholdings, and so forth, Mot. 10, but ignore that IEEPA already authorizes \n27  the President the more drastic authority to prohibit such conduct. It is thus unclear how reading “regulate” \nnaturally to include the less economically disruptive power to impose tariffs is somehow “a transformative \n28 \nexpansion in presidential authority,” id. \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

In each case, the object determines the phrase’s scope. Because the different phrases can \n2  bear different meanings, plaintiffs’ attempt to reading based on “regulate … exportation” lacks force.  \n3  Even if IEEPA authorizes the President to impose monetary fees on exportation, that would not \n4  require a narrow construction of the phrase “regulate … importation.” As defendants have explained, and \n5  plaintiffs do not deny, fees can be constitutionally imposed on exports under certain circumstances—for \n6  example, user fees and sanctions, or taxes on goods exported from territories. Doc. 14 at 13. And that a \n7  statute might be unconstitutionally applied in just one hypothetical situation, see Mot. 17-18, does not \n8  require the Court to discard the normal tools of statutory interpretation. “If constitutional avoidance means \n9  anything, it means not reaching out to address hypothetical interpretive or constitutional questions not \n10  directly presented.” Doc. 14 at 13 (citing Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 237-39 \n11  (1998); Salinas v. United States, 522 U.S. 52, 60 (1997)). Regardless, avoidance applies “only when, after \n12  the application of ordinary textual analysis, the statute is found to be susceptible of more than one \n13  construction.” Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 296 (2018). Text, context, history, and purpose show \n14  that IEEPA clearly authorizes the President to impose tariffs on imports; plaintiffs’ reading is thus “plainly \n15  contrary to the intent of Congress” and should not be adopted. Miller v. French, 530 U.S. 327, 341 (2000). \n16  2. History. IEEPA’s history confirms that it authorizes the President to impose tariffs. “Congress \n17  is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that \n18  interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978); \n19  see Tex. Dep’t of Housing & Comm. Affairs v. Inclusive Comms. Project, Inc., 576 U.S. 519, 536 (2015); \n20  Forest Grove Sch. Dist. v. T.A., 557 U.S. 230, 243 n.11 (2009). Congress drew the relevant language \n21  directly from TWEA, and it did so after the Federal Circuit’s predecessor interpreted that identical \n22  language to permit the President to impose tariffs in 1975. During the legislative process for IEEPA, \n23  Congress was well aware of the relevant language and the court’s decision interpreting the language to \n24  authorize the President to impose tariffs but chose to keep the language when it enacted IEEPA in 1977.  \n25  The key language in IEEPA, “regulate … importation,” was left unaltered from TWEA. See First \n26  War Powers Act, ch. 593, title III, § 301, 55 Stat. 839 (1941) (authorizing the President to “investigate, \n27  regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition holding, withholding, use, \n28  transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in…” (emphases added)); \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

Courts, including the Supreme Court, have repeatedly recognized the close \n2  relationship between the substantive powers in IEEPA and TWEA. See, e.g., Dames, 453 U.S. at 671-72 \n3  (this section of IEEPA was “directly drawn” from TWEA); Regan, 468 U.S. at 227-28 (“[T]he authorities \n4  granted to the President [under] IEEPA are essentially the same as those [under] TWEA.”); Sec. Pac. Nat. \n5  Bank v. Iran, 513 F. Supp. 864, 875 (C.D. Cal. 1981) (§1702 of “IEEPA is, except for stylistic changes, a \n6  reenactment of the powers previously conferred on the President by §5(b) of the TWEA”). \n7  Congress also knew of Yoshida’s interpretation of TWEA when it chose to use the same language \n8  in IEEPA. The House Report on IEEPA cited Yoshida and explained its holding. H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at \n9  5. It recounted that “section 5(b) [of TWEA] came into play when … President Nixon declared a national \n10  emergency … and under that emergency imposed a surcharge on imports,” that the Customs Court \n11  invalidated the action by holding that “section 5(b) … did not” authorize duties, and that “the Appeals \n12  Court reversed.” Id. Aware of this holding of the appellate court with exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, \n13  Congress used the same language in IEEPA.  \n14  The language Congress drew directly from TWEA carries the same meaning in IEEPA. “[W]hen \n15  Congress ‘adopt[s] the language used in [an] earlier act,’” courts “presume that Congress ‘adopted also \n16  the construction given’” to that language. Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 590 U.S. 255, 270 (2020) \n17  (citation omitted); see Taggart v. Lorenzen, 587 U.S. 554, 560 (2019) (“When a statutory term is \n18  ‘obviously transplanted from another legal source,’ it ‘brings the old soil with it.’”). That Congress \n19  provided specific exceptions to the broad grant of authority under IEEPA and that none of those exceptions \n20  curtailed the President’s authority to impose tariffs to deal with a declared national emergency confirms \n21  that Congress incorporated Yoshida’s interpretation and TWEA’s scope unless Congress specifically said \n22  otherwise. See 50 U.S.C. § 1702(b) (listing “Exceptions to Grant of Authority”). Courts, including the \n23  Supreme Court, have recognized this by applying TWEA precedent to interpret IEEPA. See Dames, 453 \n24  U.S. at 672 (“[B]oth the legislative history and cases interpreting the TWEA fully sustain the broad \n25  authority of the Executive when acting under this congressional grant of power [i.e., IEEPA].”); Sec. Pac. \n26  Nat. Bank, 513 F. Supp. at 877 (“[T]he substantial body of judicial interpretation of the TWEA should be \n27  applied to interpret the powers of the President under the IEEPA.”). \n28 \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP.

As Yoshida explained, “TWEA \n3  was not cited in Proclamation 4074 by name (though it [was] incorporated by ‘but not limited to’) because \n4  it  would  be  inappropriate  in  a  proclamation  affecting  ‘friendly’  or  ‘neutral’  nations,”  but  TWEA \n5  nonetheless provided the tariff authority for the proclamation. 526 F.2d at 575 n.22. And the 10-percent \n6  surcharge was “across the board”—it was “imposed on all dutiable articles,” with limited exceptions. Id. \n7  at 567 (emphasis added) (quoting Procl. 4074). Plaintiffs also try to discount Yoshida because it says the \n8  court did not follow its preferred textual analysis. Mot. 19 n.12. But that does not change that Congress \n9  knew of and clearly incorporated Yoshida’s interpretation of “regulate … importation.” \n10  Finally, plaintiffs contend that the enactment of Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n11  § 2132) means that Congress somehow carved out tariffs from TWEA. Mot. 19-20. This gets the history \n12  wrong again. Yoshida was decided after Section 122 was enacted, yet that court rejected the idea that \n13  statutes  applicable  in  non-emergency  situations—including  Section  122—can  narrow  the  powers \n14  available in an emergency. See 526 F.2d at 578 (“trade acts” that do not involve “national emergency \n15  powers” did not narrow TWEA’s scope). In any event, plaintiffs’ contention is belied by the intersecting \n16  timelines of the Yoshida litigation and the passage of the Trade Act of 1974. In July 1974, the trial court \n17  in Yoshida concluded that TWEA did not authorize tariffs. 378 F. Supp. 1155 (Cust. Ct. 1974). In response, \n18  Congress passed the Trade Act of 1974, which authorized the President to impose a limited surcharge to \n19  address certain balance-of-payments issues. See S. Rep. No. 93-1298, at 88 (1974) (Trade Act was \n20  “necessary … in the light of the recent decision by the … Customs Court,” despite Congress’s view that \n21  the President’s “authority” to impose import surcharges was already “manifest” (emphasis added)). But \n22  the appellate court’s decision reversing the trial court and holding that “regulate … importation” authorizes \n23  tariffs was issued after the enactment of Section 122. Thus, when Congress enacted Section 122 in 1974, \n24  it sought only to ensure that, if the appellate court did not reverse the trial court, the President would still \n25  have a mechanism to impose tariffs to address balance-of-payments problems. And when it enacted IEEPA \n26  in 1977, the most recent change in the statutory landscape was Yoshida—not Section 122. Plaintiffs point \n27  to no history supporting the notion that Congress enacted a non-emergency statute (Section 122) to strip \n28 \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM.

See Emily Ley at 14 n.15 (explaining \n2  why Section 122 and IEEPA’s history confirm that IEEPA includes the power to impose tariffs).  \n3  3. Purpose. Finally, IEEPA’s evident purpose confirms that it includes the power to impose tariffs. \n4  The purpose of emergency statutes, like IEEPA, is to give the President broad and flexible powers to \n5  effectively address problems associated with a national emergency. “[T]he primary implication of an \n6  emergency power is that it should be effective to deal with a national emergency successfully.” Yoshida, \n7  526 F.2d at 573. “The delegation in” IEEPA, like TWEA “is broad and extensive; it could not have been \n8  otherwise if the President were to have, within constitutional boundaries, the flexibility required to meet \n9  problems surrounding a national emergency with the success desired by Congress.” Id.; accord Spawr, \n10  685 F.2d at 1080 (same). Indeed, “the legislative history of [IEEPA] notes that the authorities available to \n11  the President should be sufficiently broad and flexible to enable the President to respond as appropriate \n12  and necessary to unforeseen contingencies.” 6 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 644, 681 (1982). Interpreting \n13  IEEPA to include the power to impose tariffs furthers Congress’s purpose to give the President the critical \n14  tools and flexibility to handle national emergencies. \n15   “[S]tatutes granting the President authority to act in matters touching on foreign affairs are to be \n16  broadly construed.” B-West Imports v. United States, 75 F.3d 633, 636 (Fed. Cir. 1996). Indeed, in foreign \n17  affairs, “broad grants by Congress of discretion to the Executive are common.” Florsheim Shoe Co. v. \n18  United States, 744 F.2d 787, 795 (Fed. Cir. 1984). IEEPA “is intimately involved with foreign affairs, an \n19  area in which congressional authorizations of presidential power should be given a broad construction and \n20  not hemmed in or cabined, cribbed, confined by anxious judicial blinders.” Id. at 793 (cleaned up); see, \n21  e.g., Al-Bihani v. Obama, 619 F.3d 1, 38-39 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring). When foreign \n22  affairs and national security are involved, “the President plays a dominant role,” and “it is generally \n23  assumed that Congress does not set out to tie the President’s hands; if it wishes to, it must say so in clear \n24  language.” Humane Soc’y of U.S. v. Clinton, 236 F.3d 1320, 1329 (Fed. Cir. 2001). Plaintiffs cannot point \n25  to clear language cabining the President’s authority. Just the opposite—text, history, and context all show \n26  that IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs. \n27  4. The Major-Questions Doctrine. In plaintiffs’ view, the Court should not presume that Congress \n28  delegated authority to the President because of the tariffs’ economic and political significance. Mot. 14-\n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  18 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 29 of 36\n \n1  17. But the major-questions doctrine does not apply here, and the statute is clear in any event.  \n2  At the threshold, the major-questions doctrine does not apply because “the statute at issue” does \n3  not “confer[] authority upon an administrative agency.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022). \n4  It confers authority on the President. The Supreme Court has never applied the doctrine to a delegation \n5  to the President. It instead describes the doctrine as applying to statutes giving authority to agencies. The \n6  major-questions “label … took hold because it refers to an identifiable body of law that has developed \n7  over a series of significant cases all addressing a particular and recurring problem: agencies asserting \n8  highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.” Id. \n9  at 724 (cleaned up) (emphasis added). Unlike the President, agencies lack political accountability. See \n10  NFIB v. Dep’t of Lab., 595 U.S. 109, 125 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (allowing Congress to “hand \n11  off all its legislative powers to unelected agency officials” would replace “government by the people” \n12  with “government by bureaucracy”). No political-accountability justification applies here, where “the \n13  Framers made the President the most democratic and politically accountable official in Government,” \n14  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 224 (2020), and the President directs an action in an executive \n15  order. A unanimous panel of the Ninth Circuit recognized that “[t]he Major Questions Doctrine is \n16  motivated by skepticism of agency interpretations” and “does not apply to Presidential actions.” Mayes \n17  v. Biden, 67 F.4th 921, 933, 934 (9th Cir. 2023), vacated as moot by 89 F.4th 1186 (9th Cir. 2023).  \n18  Similarly, the major-questions doctrine does not apply to national-security and foreign-policy \n19  matters. A major-questions approach treats a decision with a “measure of skepticism.” Util. Air Regul. \n20  Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014). That approach is irreconcilable with longstanding precedent \n21  compelling the opposite approach in these contexts. See, e.g., Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 686 (2018) \n22  (acknowledging “the deference traditionally accorded the President” on these matters); Dep’t of Navy v. \n23  Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 529-30 (1988) (recounting the “utmost deference to Presidential responsibilities” that \n24  courts have “traditionally shown” in these matters). In this area, unlike in major-questions cases, there is \n25  no “reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer” significant authority to regulate \n26  foreign  commerce on the President. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 721  (cleaned up). The President’s \n27  overlapping powers in the national-security and foreign-affairs realm further diminish any concerns of \n28  unauthorized overreach. There, the President’s “authority is at its maximum” when he acts pursuant to the \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  19 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 30 of 36\n \n1  “authorization of Congress,” and in those circumstances he “may be said” to “personify the federal \n2  sovereignty.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-36 (1952) (Jackson, J., \n3  concurring in the judgment).4  \n4  Even if the major-questions doctrine were not categorically inapplicable, plaintiffs press no \n5  persuasive argument that it would apply to the challenged tariffs. The Supreme Court has identified several \n6  traits of regulatory action that, in combination, implicate the major-questions doctrine when an agency \n7  takes a sufficiently significant action. No one doubts the significance of the challenged tariffs, but \n8  significance alone is not enough; otherwise, the doctrine would apply to countless government actions, \n9  including every emergency statute and, paradoxically, to any matter of national security. None of the \n10  remaining indicia of major questions—let alone an adequate combination—are present here.  \n11  IEEPA raises no nondelegation concerns, as plaintiffs concede. See United States v. Shih, 73 F.4th \n12  1077, 1092 (9th Cir. 2023) (rejecting nondelegation challenge to IEEPA). The President’s use of IEEPA \n13  is also not an exercise of “unheralded” power, Mot. 14, especially given the President’s exercise of his \n14  tariff power under materially identical language in IEEPA’s predecessor statute. West Virginia, 597 U.S. \n15  at 724. Likewise, the President’s challenged actions accord with a robust history of similar exercises of \n16  power under IEEPA to achieve foreign-policy objectives by regulating imports and exports—often with \n17  even more serious measures like total or near-total embargoes. See, e.g., E.O. 13873, 84 Fed. Reg. 22,689 \n18  (May 15, 2019) (invoking IEEPA to bar the “importation … of any information and communications \n19 \n \n20  4 Plaintiffs claim “every Court of Appeals” has “applied the major-questions doctrine” to presidential \naction, Mot. 15, but their count is off. Since Mayes unanimously held the doctrine inapplicable, one Ninth \n21  Circuit judge applied the doctrine to the President. Nebraska v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 20 (9th Cir. 2024) (Nelson, \nJ., concurring), pet. for reh’g pending, No. 23-13179. The Su majority expressly declined to address the \n22 \n“argument that this doctrine does not apply to congressional delegations of authority to the President.” Id. \nat 14 n.6. Authority in other circuits is mixed. The Eleventh Circuit has not held the doctrine applies to \n23 \npresidential action. A single judge signed the lead opinion in Georgia v. President of the United States, 46 \n24  F.4th 1283, 1289 (11th Cir. 2022). An opinion concurring in the result makes no mention of the major-\nquestions doctrine. Id. (Edmondson, J., concurring in the result). And the panel’s third judge would have \n25  held the doctrine inapplicable. Id. at 1313 (Anderson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Judge \nAnderson recognized that “the President … does not suffer from the same lack of political accountability \n26 \nthat  agencies  may,  particularly  when  the  President  acts  on  a  question  of  economic  and  political \nsignificance.” Id. A dissenting judge in Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th 1017 (5th Cir. 2022), would have \n27 \nfollowed Judge Anderson’s reasoning. Id. at 1038 (Graves, J., dissenting). As for the Sixth Circuit, in \n28  Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585 (6th Cir. 2022), the court “never squarely addressed its reasoning for \ntreating presidential action the same as agency action.” Mayes, 67 F.4th at 933-34. \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  20 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 31 of 36\n \n1  technology” that was “designed, developed, manufactured, or supplied, by persons owned by, controlled \n2  by, or subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign adversary”); E.O. 12959, 60 Fed. Reg. 24,757 \n3  (May 9, 1995) (invoking IEEPA to bar “the importation into the United States or the financing of such \n4  importation of any goods or services of Iranian origin,” with certain exceptions); Cong. Rsch. Serv., \n5  IEEPA: Origins, Evolution, and Use, R45618, 58-62 (Jan. 30, 2024) (collecting dozens of similar uses of \n6  IEEPA to regulate imports and exports). \n7  IEEPA’s authorization of the President to regulate imports in an emergency is not a catch-all clause \n8  or “modest words” in an “ancillary provision” of the statute. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723-24. Just the \n9  opposite: the power is conferred as one of the enumerated terms in a list of powers making up one of the \n10  statute’s “key provisions,” United States v. Cal. Stem Cell Treatment Ctr., 117 F.4th 1213, 1221 (9th Cir. \n11  2024), and that term straightforwardly grants the President broad, consequential powers over foreign \n12  commerce to deal with broad, consequential problems facing the country. Section 1702(a)(1)(B), by \n13  including authorization for the President to “regulate … importation,” could never be mistaken for a \n14  mousehole—especially when Congress expressly acknowledged that the appellate court with exclusive \n15  jurisdiction over the matter had just conclusively interpreted that language to convey tariff authority.  \n16  Applying the major-questions doctrine would also conflict with the strong presumption that \n17  statutes granting the President authority to act in foreign-affairs matters are often broadly written and \n18  broadly  construed.  “[T]he  Supreme  Court  has  consistently  emphasized  that  broad  delegations  are \n19  appropriate in the foreign policy arena because of the political nature of the decisions and the compelling \n20  need for uniformity,” which is why Congress “must of necessity paint with a brush broader than that it \n21  customarily wields in domestic areas.” United States v. Bozarov, 974 F.2d 1037, 1044 (9th Cir. 1992). \n22  After all, “it would be impossible for Congress to revise [statutory authorities] quickly enough to respond \n23  to the fast-paced developments in the foreign policy arena.” Id.; see United States v. Gurrola-Garcia, 547 \n24  F.2d 1075, 1079 (9th Cir. 1976) (“[T]he principle that Congress may delegate broad authority to the \n25  President in foreign affairs is clearly controlling law today.”). It would be “unwis[e]” to “requir[e] \n26  Congress in this field of governmental power to lay down narrowly definite standards.” United States v. \n27  Kuok, 671 F.3d 931, 939 (9th Cir. 2012). So it is “far from ‘implausible’ that Congress contemplated” \n28  giving the President broad powers including tariffs “as a means of achieving its clear directive.” Panoche \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  21 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 32 of 36\n \n1  Energy Ctr., LLC v. EPA, 2024 WL 3043005, at *1 (9th Cir. June 18); Corbett v. TSA, 19 F.4th 478, 488 \n2  (D.C. Cir. 2021) (Broad statutory language “‘reflects an intentional effort to confer the flexibility \n3  necessary’ for TSA to address yet unknown threats to transportation security and safety as they arise.”). \n4  Finally, the major-questions doctrine compares the statute’s text to the power exercised. The \n5  doctrine is more likely to apply when the power exercised amounts to “a fundamental revision of the \n6  statute, changing it from one sort of scheme of regulation into an entirely different kind,” Biden v. \n7  Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 502 (2023) (cleaned up)—or, put differently, whether the power goes “beyond \n8  what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted,” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 724. These \n9  considerations are already accounted for. But to sum up: IEEPA unambiguously confers far-reaching \n10  emergency powers over foreign trade, the President has repeatedly exercised those powers in comparable \n11  actions and contexts, and those powers fall within the President’s core competencies of national security \n12  and foreign affairs. The exercise of tariff authority is thus not transformative or surprising. The major-\n13  questions doctrine is not implicated here. \n14  Even if it were, the Executive Orders would still be supported by the “clear congressional \n15  authorization for the power” to impose and modify tariffs in response to unfair foreign trade practices. \n16  West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723. The major-questions doctrine provides no basis to invalidate an action \n17  where the statute “specifically authorizes the [agency] to make decisions like th[e] one” under review. \n18  United States v. White, 97 F.4th 532, 540 (7th Cir. 2024). That remains true when the authorization is \n19  couched in clear but broad language. See Florida v. HHS, 19 F.4th 1271, 1288 (11th Cir. 2021) (major-\n20  questions doctrine did not apply because “a broad grant of authority” that “plainly encompasses the \n21  [agency’s] actions … does not require an indication that specific activities are permitted”); Nebraska, 600 \n22  U.S. at 511 (Barrett, J., concurring) (unlike true “clear-statement” rules, major-questions doctrine does not \n23  require  “an  ‘unequivocal  declaration’  from  Congress  authorizing  the precise agency  action  under \n24  review”); West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723 (“something more than a merely plausible textual basis for the \n25  agency action is necessary” (emphasis added)). Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has found the relevant language \n26  here to be “unambiguous” and to “clearly show[] that the President’s actions [imposing tariffs] were in \n27  accordance with the power Congress delegated.” Spawr, 685 F.2d at 1081 n.10 (emphases added). So has \n28  the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida, which recently concluded in a similar case \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  22 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 33 of 36\n \n1  “that Congress provided the ‘clear authorization’ required under the modern major questions doctrine \n2  cases when it incorporated TWEA’s operative language—along with Yoshida’s judicial gloss on that \n3  language—into IEEPA verbatim.” Emily Ley at 12-13. \n4  III.  Plaintiffs Fail To Show the Remaining Preliminary-Injunction Factors \n5  Plaintiffs also cannot meet their heavy burden to show they will be irreparably injured before being \n6  heard on the merits. Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. “[S]peculation on future harm” and “unsupported and \n7  conclusory statements” are insufficient. Herb Reed Enters. v. Fla. Entm’t Mgmt., 736 F.3d 1239, 1250 (9th \n8  Cir. 2013). Simply showing some possibility of irreparable injury fails to satisfy this factor—the injury \n9  must be “likely.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 22. Conclusory statements in affidavits from an interested party have \n10  limited value. See Oakland Trib., Inc. v. Chronicle Pub. Co., 762 F.2d 1374, 1377 (9th Cir. 1985). \n11  To start, plaintiffs’ delay in moving for preliminary-injunctive relief strongly suggests they will \n12  not be irreparably harmed absent an injunction. A “long delay before seeking a preliminary injunction \n13  implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.” Miller v. Cal. Pac. Med. Ctr., 991 F.2d 536, 544 (9th Cir. \n14  1993). Indeed, preliminary relief exists to give a court enough time to engage in the ordinary adjudicative \n15  process. Thus, “[o]nly when the threatened harm would impair the court’s ability to grant an effective \n16  remedy is there really a need for preliminary relief.” 11A Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and \n17  Procedure § 2948.1 (3d ed. 2025). But here, plaintiffs waited nearly four months after the first IEEPA \n18  tariffs were imposed, and a month after they filed their action, to move for a preliminary injunction. This \n19  pace belies any claim that time is of the essence. Both the Ninth Circuit and this Court have held that \n20  similar delays justify the denial of extraordinary relief. See, e.g., Garcia v. Google, Inc., 786 F.3d 733, 746 \n21  (9th Cir. 2015) (five months); Westerman v. FTI Consulting, Inc., 2025 WL 256978, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Jan. \n22  21) (four months). Plus, plaintiffs now say they prefer dismissal over transfer to a court that could decide \n23  their preliminary injunction motion, further belying any claim that they fear imminent irreparable harm. \n24  In any event, California’s speculative claims of potential price increases unmoored from the challenged \n25  tariffs fail to meet the high bar required for preliminary injunctive relief. See, e.g., Herb Reed Enters., 736 \n26  F.3d at 1250.  \n27  Regardless, any harm to plaintiffs would still be outweighed by the balance of hardships and the \n28  public interest, which “merge when the Government is the opposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, \n  DEFS.’ RESP. IN OPP. TO PLS.’ MOT. FOR PRELIM. INJUNCTION \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  23 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 55     Filed 05/27/25     Page 34 of 36\n \n1  435 (2009). Just last week, in staying a district court’s interim relief, the Supreme Court reaffirmed that \n2  “[t]he purpose of … interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties, but \n3  to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.” Trump v. Wilcox, 2025 WL 1464804, at *1 (U.S. \n4  May 22) (quoting Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, 580 (2017)).  Here, this factor \n5  dramatically favors defendants. The President has declared a national emergency in light of threats to the \n6  United States’s economy, military preparedness, and national security. A preliminary injunction would \n7  seriously, immediately, and irreparably harm ongoing United States diplomatic efforts, foreign policy, \n8  and national security. Bessent Decl. ¶¶ 9-13; Greer Decl. ¶¶ 6, 9-15; Lutnick Decl. ¶¶ 1, 7-15, 19; Rubio \n9  Decl. ¶¶ 3, 8-16. A preliminary injunction could shatter current diplomatic efforts, eliminating the premise \n10  of ongoing negotiations with dozens of countries.  Bessent Decl. ¶¶ 10-13; Greer Decl. ¶¶ 7, 9-13; Lutnick \n11  Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11-13, 15, 19; Rubio Decl. ¶¶ 8-12. Negotiations cannot simply be paused and resumed at a \n12  moment’s notice. This disruption of negotiations with other countries would irreparably harm United \n13  States diplomacy and national security.  Bessent Decl. ¶¶ 11-13; Greer Decl. ¶¶ 6, 11-15; Lutnick Decl. \n14  ¶¶ 1, 11-19; Rubio Decl. ¶¶ 3-4, 10-16; see Widakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL 1288817, at *5 (D.C. Cir. \n15  May 3) (interfering with foreign affairs irreparably harms the government).  \n16  These grave and certain harms to the federal government and the public interest mandate denial of \n17  injunctive relief here. In Wilcox, the Supreme Court held that “the Government faces greater risk of harm \n18  from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully \n19  removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.” 2025 WL 1465804, at *1. It was \n20  enough that interim relief would create a “disruptive effect of … repeated removal and reinstatement of \n21  officers.” Id. Here, the stakes for the government are even higher, and the “disruptive effect” of interim \n22  equitable relief would be extraordinarily harmful to the conduct of American foreign policy and destabilize \n23  the economy. E.g., Winter, 555 U.S. at 23-28 (interference with national-security needs independently \n24  precluded preliminary injunction). \n25  IV.  Any Preliminary Injunction Should Be Stayed, Limited Only To Plaintiffs, And Would \nRequire Them To Post A Bond \n26 \n27  For substantially the same reasons, if the Court were to grant a preliminary injunction, it is \n28  imperative that the Court temporarily stay the injunction so that defendants can appeal and seek emergency \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

Nationwide injunctions are only available in “exceptional cases.” San Francisco v. Trump, 896 \n4  F.3d 1225, 1244 (9th Cir. 2018); see Florida, 19 F.4th at 1282 (appropriate circumstances for issuing a \n5  nationwide injunction “are rare”); Chicago v. Barr, 961 F.3d 882, 916 (7th Cir. 2020) (“[s]uch injunctions \n6  present real dangers, and will be appropriate only in rare circumstances”). Here, plaintiffs cannot show \n7  why a preliminary injunction is necessary at all, let alone a universal one. Certainly, they cannot show that \n8  they will be deprived of complete relief without a universal injunction. Cf. Florida, 19 F.4th at 1281. And \n9  any relief must run only to the State of California—not to all who import there. Again, California does \n10  not have standing as parens patriae to seek relief on behalf of all those who import through its ports. \n11  Murthy, 603 U.S. at 76; Haaland, 599 U.S. at 294-95.  \n12  The Court must also require plaintiffs to “give[] [a] security in an amount that the court considers \n13  proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been wrongfully enjoined or \n14  restrained.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c). “[I]njunction bonds are generally required,” and cannot be avoided by \n15  arguing that a bond would “conflict with [the] right to seek judicial review.” Nat’l Treas. Emps. Union v. \n16  Trump, 2025 WL 1441563, at *3 n.4 (D.C. Cir. May 16). In the tariff context, Rule 65 requires a plaintiff \n17  to post single transaction bonds for each importation of goods that would have otherwise been subject to \n18  the challenged tariffs. See, e.g., PrimeSource Bldg. Prods. v. United States, 535 F. Supp. 3d 1327, 1330 \n19  (Ct. Int’l Trade 2021). That plaintiffs are not importers who have paid tariffs again confirms that injunctive \n20  relief is inappropriate. But if the Court entered broader relief, plaintiffs would be required to post a bond \n21  in the amount of revenue lost by the U.S. government from interim relief—a figure that could easily reach \n22  billions depending on the scope of relief. The bond must be measured by all the tariffs that importers \n23  would have paid absent an injunction. If the Court will not impose an injunction bond, then the equities \n24  favor defendants even more. See Widakuswara, 2025 WL 1288817, at *5 (finding irreparable harm to the \n25  government when district court does not require an injunction bond). \n26  CONCLUSION \n27  For these reasons, the Court should deny plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \n28   \n  DEFS.’ RESP.

Flores, and \n5  U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) (collectively, “Agency Defendants”) from \n6  implementing or enforcing any order, proclamation, or directive pursuant to the International \n7  Economic Emergency Powers Act that purports to impose tariffs or directs the imposition of \n8  tariffs, and from collecting any such tariffs.  The motions are based on this Notice; the following \n9  Memorandum of Points and Authorities; the Declarations of Dr. Kimberly Clausing, Erica York, \n10  Angela Shell, Lori Bradley, Jesse Bignami, Dr. Somjita Mitra, and Colby White; the prior filings \n11  in this action; and all other matters properly before the Court. \n12  MEMORANDUM OF POINTS AND AUTHORITIES \n13  INTRODUCTION \n14  In the past three months, President Trump—acting alone and without the consent of \n15  Congress—has issued a flurry of executive orders imposing across-the-board tariffs on imports \n16  from every U.S. trading partner at staggering rates.  These tariffs cause exponential and \n17  irreparable harm to the State of California and Governor Newsom on myriad levels: As a major \n18  and direct procurer of billions of dollars-worth of goods, California now faces having to thwart its \n19  own negotiated contracts and accept price increases or forgo essential purchases; has significantly \n20  downgraded revenue forecasts that fund the Governor’s budget due to tariff impact and \n21  uncertainty; has been unable to rely on the Legislature’s approved budget; and has already spent \n22  countless hours and resources in addressing the anticipated unavailability of goods as a result of \n23  the tariffs.  California suffers crippling outsize impacts due to its status as the fourth largest \n24  economy in the world; the harm to it is irreparable.   \n25  President Trump has issued these devastating and unprecedented tariffs without \n26  authorization of law.  He invokes the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) \n27  as the purported legal basis for his tariffs.  But IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  Defendants pick \n28  two words out of one section of IEEPA, 50 U.S.C. § 1702 (a)(1)(B), string them together with an \n \n  1   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (No. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC) \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 15     Filed 05/13/25     Page 9 of 33\n \n1  ellipsis to read “regulate . . . importation,” and try to construe this ellipted phrase—in isolation \n2  and shorn of context—as authorizing tariffs.  But this cannot be squared with IEEPA’s statutory \n3  text.  Indeed, Defendants cannot come up with an internally consistent construction of the word \n4  “regulate,” and have taken the astonishing position that “regulate” “need not carry the same \n5  meaning” consistently within IEEPA.  Transfer Reply 12 (emphasis added).  Apparently, under \n6  Defendants’ view, the meaning of “regulate” is not fixed and can change within a single statute, \n7  such that “regulate” happens to mean to tariff or tax when paired with “importation,” even though \n8  this meaning is inconsistent with the rest of the statute.  That Defendants cannot provide an \n9  internally consistent construction of “regulate” that supports their claim that “regulate . . . \n10  importation” authorizes tariffs, confirms that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  President \n11  Trump’s orders purporting to impose tariffs pursuant to IEEPA (“IEEPA Tariff Orders”) thus are \n12  unlawful, ultra vires, and violate the constitutional requirement of separation of powers. \n13  Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction restraining Agency Defendants from \n14  implementing or enforcing the IEEPA Tariff Orders.  First, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \n15  merits, because IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  Second, Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm \n16  absent an injunction: their contracts are upended by vendors seeking to pass on increased costs to \n17  the State, and they have diverted significant resources to determine whether to pay more for \n18  necessary goods or forgo those goods altogether; they also stand to lose billions of dollars in tax \n19  revenue, all due to these tariffs.  An immediate injunction is the only adequate remedy.  Third, the \n20  balance of equities and public interest tip sharply in Plaintiffs’ favor, because there is no public \n21  harm from an injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice and preserves the status quo that \n22  existed prior to the unlawful IEEPA Tariff Orders’ cataclysmic economic effects. \n23  BACKGROUND \n24  I.  President Trump has recently claimed authority under IEEPA to issue multiple \nexecutive orders imposing tariffs on every U.S. trading partner \n25 \nIn the past few months, President Trump has issued over a dozen executive orders pursuant \n26 \nto IEEPA imposing, pausing, reimposing, and escalating tariffs on every U.S. trading partner.  \n27 \nSee generally York ¶¶ 28-42 (timeline of IEEPA tariff actions).  These tariffs are “broad and \n28 \n \n  2   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.

York. ¶¶ 37, 39; see also id. ¶¶ 36, 41 (exemptions).  Separately, \n5  Canada and Mexico are subject to IEEPA tariffs of up to 25%.  Id. ¶¶ 29-30, 32-34; see also id. \n6  ¶¶ 32-33 (exemptions).  And China is subject to an ever-changing combination of IEEPA tariffs \n7  that reached a staggering rate of 145%.1   Id. ¶¶ 9-32, 37-40; see also id. ¶¶ 36, 41 (exemptions).  \n8  The claimed rationale for these tariffs is wide-ranging, from trade deficits to immigration, crime, \n9  and illicit drugs.  Clausing ¶ 13.  In response to President Trump’s tariffs, major U.S. trading \n10  partners including China, Canada, and the EU imposed or announced retaliatory tariffs.  York ¶¶ \n11  43-44 (listing billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports).  \n12  Tariffs are a type of excise tax imposed by governments, generally applied to imported \n13  goods.  Id. ¶ 12.  They are not paid by foreign governments—rather, if the importer is a U.S. \n14  person or company, that U.S. person or company is the one who has to pay the tariff.  Id. ¶12.  \n15  II.  The impact of President Trump’s unprecedented IEEPA tariffs is devastating \n16  “The scope, impact, and swiftness of the Trump Administration’s 2025 tariffs are \n17  unprecedented[,]” generating “enormous economic damage to both the U.S. economy and the \n18  California economy.”  Clausing ¶¶ 10, 47.  Economic modeling simulates that the effects of the \n19  IEEPA tariffs will reduce U.S. economic output by more than $178 billion, reduce labor supply \n20  by 546,000 full-time equivalent jobs, and lower after-tax incomes on average by nearly a full \n21  percentage point.  Id. ¶¶ 51, 53.  President Trump’s tariffs “will be the largest tax increase in \n22  more than a generation for U.S. consumers.”  Clausing ¶ 47.   \n23  The tariffs will also cause higher prices and less availability of goods, leading to shortages  \n \n24  1 On May 12, 2025, the Trump Administration announced that tariffs on China would be lowered \nto 30% for 90 days.  Joint Statement on U.S.-China Economic and Trade Meeting in Geneva \n25  (May 12, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/4cxy22zv.  The damage posed by tariffs even with this pause \nis still approximately 60% of the damage forecasted prior to the pause.  Clausing ¶ 10 n.1.  \n26  Additionally, on May 4, 2025, President Trump announced via social media post that he was \n“authorizing” agencies to impose 100% tariffs “on any and all Movies coming into our Country \n27  that are produced in Foreign Lands[,]” although no orders have been issued nor legal authority \nidentified.

The Port of Los Angeles alone saw a third of its import \n2  volume disappear as of the first week of May, which will affect the availability of goods in stores \n3  in only a few weeks.

And nationally, as a “preview of the shortages which \n4  will follow,” container bookings from China dropped 60 percent after the imposition of a 125 \n5  percent tariff on imports from China.  York ¶ 46.   \n6  President Trump’s tariffs also “risk pushing the larger macroeconomy into a recession, and \n7  will have lasting harm on unemployment, economic growth, and government budgets.”  Clausing \n8  ¶ 10; see also id. ¶ 41 (forecasters have reduced their estimates of U.S. gross domestic product \n9  (GDP) growth and “substantially raised the probability of a recession due to the tariffs.”).  \n10  Recessions are damaging to public finance and state budgets and “can also mean abrupt \n11  curtailment of spending in areas of pressing need, such as public safety, education, and disaster \n12  preparedness.”  Clausing ¶ 45. \n13  Finally, the “on-again, off-again” nature of recent tariffs (with messaging that reprieves are \n14  only temporary, and higher tariffs may yet be imposed) has left economic actors, including \n15  Plaintiffs, uncertain—which itself causes harm.  Clausing ¶ 42.  “Uncertainty itself has a chilling \n16  effect on the economy, as businesses and people pause decision-making, or cancel and lose out on \n17  opportunities altogether.”  York ¶ 45.  In particular, this uncertainty “frustrates and impairs the \n18  ability of state and local governments to budget and plan” due to the difficulty forecasting project \n19  costs.  Clausing ¶ 42.  As follows, this is especially true for California. \n20  III.  President Trump’s IEEPA tariffs especially harm California \n21  Plaintiffs the State of California and Governor Newsom are suffering and will continue to \n22  suffer particularized and outsized harm from the IEEPA tariffs.  This harm will compound \n23  exponentially the longer the tariffs remain in effect, with more to come as pauses soon expire.  \n24  “While the economic losses from tariffs will be felt across the entire U.S. economy, California \n25  will experience an outsized share of its losses due to its larger economy and workforce as well as \n26  exposure to trade.”  York ¶ 66.  Economic modeling estimates that the loss to California’s \n27  economy would be $25 billion, with job losses of more than 64,000.

Shell ¶¶ 9, 11; see also id. ¶ 12 (Department of General Services anticipates \n7  receiving at least 18 individual contract price increase requests due to the tariffs).  \n8  These increased procurement costs harm California’s core functions and goals.  For \n9  example, the California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”), which is the largest \n10  healthcare purchaser in California and serves more than half of all of California’s children, \n11  recently contracted to authorize purchases of $8 billion of pharmaceuticals from various foreign \n12  countries.  Id. ¶¶ 3, 6.  In another example, the California Department of Public Health (“CDPH”) \n13  recently spent almost $200,000 to procure key laboratory instruments from China used to conduct \n14  gene sequencing of various viruses.  Bignami ¶¶ 6-7.  If a price increase due to tariffs causes a \n15  purchase to exceed the budget of a program, the purchase cannot be made, id. ¶ 7, and California \n16  may be forced to terminate the contract, Shell ¶ 15.  California’s Chief Procurement Officer “does \n17  not anticipate being able to find alternate sources, on a large scale, for goods to mitigate against \n18  the price increases attributable to tariffs.”  Id. ¶ 12.  As such, the tariffs confront California with \n19  the impossible choice of whether to accept increased costs, no matter how high, or to try to re-\n20  procure (at a huge scale), so that agencies can access critically needed supplies.  Id. ¶¶ 21-23.  \n21  And because of anticipated shortages due to the tariffs, Clausing ¶ 34, California runs the risk that \n22  it may not be able to procure the goods it needs at all, Shell ¶ 23.

The Division has already \n2  “expended considerable effort and numerous work hours” assessing, reacting, and responding to \n3  tariff induced procurement issues, and the mere act of reviewing individual justifications for each \n4  tariff-related price increase request is an arduous process on such a scale.  Shell ¶ 19.  Further, the \n5  uncertainty caused by “[t]he application of abrupt and ever-changing tariff amounts applied on an \n6  ad hoc basis and outside of the Legislature’s budgeting process makes it impossible for State \n7  agencies to abide by their legislatively approved budgets.”  Id. ¶ 22. \n8  The harms from the current tariffs and their uncertain nature are reflected in California’s \n9  recently downgraded economic and tax revenue projections for the 2025-2026 Governor’s Budget \n10  due the potential impact of tariffs.

In turn, \n13  the California Tax Revenue Forecast downgraded its projection for state corporate taxable profit \n14  growth, attributing approximately $1.7 billion of the downgrade to the negative effect of tariffs.  \n15  White ¶ 5; see also id. ¶¶ 6-8 (multiple other revenue sources were downgraded by billions of \n16  dollars due to projected tariff impact, including but not limited to taxable wages, partnership \n17  income, and business income).

(quotation marks omitted). \n2  In determining whether an injunction seeks to alter or maintain the status quo, where the \n3  government has changed a policy, courts look not to the time when the action was filed but \n4  instead to the time prior to the government’s policy change.  Id. at 684-85.  The status quo here is \n5  the status prior to President Trump’s tariff orders.  Id. \n6  ARGUMENT \n7  I.  Plaintiffs Have Article III Standing \n8  Plaintiffs have standing because they are directly harmed by the IEEPA Tariff Orders and \n9  that harm would be redressed by declaring them unlawful and enjoining their enforcement.  States \n10  have standing when they have “suffered an injury in fact—a concrete and imminent harm to a \n11  legally protected interest, like property or money—that is fairly traceable to the challenged \n12  conduct and likely to be redressed by the lawsuit.”  Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 489 (2023).  \n13  Those injuries may be economic, see id., or harm proprietary interests, which “are as varied as a \n14  [state’s] responsibilities, powers, and assets” and include “its powers of revenue collection.”  City \n15  of Sausalito v. O’Neill, 386 F.3d 1186, 1197-98 (9th Cir. 2004). \n16  Defendants’ unlawful IEEPA tariffs are causing and will continue to cause Plaintiffs \n17  economic harm and harm to their proprietary interests.  First, as a market participant, California \n18  buys necessary foreign-manufactured goods, which will become more expensive, or even \n19  unavailable, due to the IEEPA tariffs.  York ¶ 60; Clausing ¶ 10; see also Shell ¶¶ 9, 11 (vendors \n20  notifying California of price-increase requests due to tariffs).  Plaintiffs’ loss of the opportunity to \n21  purchase desirable lower-priced goods satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement.  See, e.g., \n22  Weissman v. Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp., 21 F.4th 854, 857 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (“the lost \n23  opportunity to purchase a desired product constitute[s] an injury-in-fact”); Orangeburg v. FERC, \n24  862 F.3d 1071, 1078-80 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (city had standing where it lost opportunity to purchase \n25  wholesale power on desirable terms, even where substitutable products existed and existing \n26  contracts precluded a status quo change for five years); Louisiana v. U.S. Dep’t of Energy, 90 \n27  F.4th 461, 467-69 (5th Cir. 2024) (states had standing as direct purchasers of dishwashers and \n28  laundry machines where they lost opportunity to purchase more desirable models). \n \n  7   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

White ¶ 5 (one \n3  singular revenue stream in the tax revenue forecast attributes “approximately $1.7 billion of the \n4  downgrade in fiscal year 2025-26 to the negative effect of tariffs.”); see supra Background III.  \n5  This too, and the resulting harm to Plaintiffs in the performance of their public functions, is a \n6  sufficient injury-in-fact to confer Article III standing.  See, e.g., Nebraska, 600 U.S. at 491 \n7  (finding direct injury to state where President’s student-loan forgiveness plan would cut revenues \n8  of state-created corporation and thus impair its efforts to aid state’s college students, constituting \n9  harm in the performance of its public function); City of Oakland v. Lynch, 798 F.3d 1159, 1164 \n10  (9th Cir. 2015) (city had standing based on projected $1.4 million lost tax revenue from action \n11  against medical marijuana dispensaries).   \n12  Plaintiffs’ injuries are both traceable to the IEEPA Tariff Orders and are redressable by this \n13  Court declaring them unlawful and enjoining Agency Defendants from implementing or \n14  enforcing them.  To the extent there is a “causal chain” linking a state to the harm, this “does not \n15  foreclose standing[.]”  California v. Azar, 911 F.3d 558, 571 (9th Cir. 2018) (states established \n16  standing where some female residents would lose at least some healthcare coverage due to \n17  challenged actions, in turn inflicting economic harm to the States).  For these reasons, Plaintiffs \n18  have standing to challenge the IEEPA Tariff Orders and whether IEEPA authorizes tariffs. \n19  II.  Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits That President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff \nOrders Are Unlawful  \n20 \nA.  The Plain Language of IEEPA Confirms It Does Not Authorize Tariffs \n21 \nThe plain language of IEEPA confirms that it does not authorize tariffs.  See Transfer \n22 \nOpp’n 12-16.  And Defendants’ theory that the “regulate . . . importation” language they cherry-\n23 \npicked and pulled out of context from 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B) authorizes tariffs, fails. \n24 \nAs used in a statute, “to regulate something is usually understood to mean to ‘fix the time, \n25 \namount, degree, or rate’ of an activity ‘according to rule[s],’” Ysleta del Sur Pueblo v. Texas, 596 \n26 \nU.S. 685, 697 (2022) (quoting Regulate, Webster’s Third International Dictionary 1913 (1986)), \n27 \nor “[t]o control (an activity or process) esp. through the implementation of rules.”  Regulate, \n28 \n \n  8   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

This does not encompass the power to impose tariffs, which are not controls but \n3  instead are simply taxes on imports.  Clausing ¶¶ 17-19.  A tariff simply extracts funds from the \n4  importer; it does not control imports or fix their time, amount, degree, or rate.  Id.; see also, e.g., \n5  Jefferson Cnty. v. Acker, 527 U.S. 423, 440 (1999) (discussing how imposing a tax on federal \n6  officials does “no[t] in any way regulate[] them in the performance of their duties”); Diginet, Inc. \n7  v. Western Union ATS, Inc., 958 F.2d 1388, 1399 (7th Cir. 1992) (“The legal power to regulate is \n8  not necessarily the legal power to tax.”).  Imposing tariffs on imports does not fall within the \n9  plain language of § 1702(a)(1)(B) or within the power to “regulate . . . importation.” \n10  That “regulate . . . importation” does not encompass the power to impose tariffs is further \n11  evident when “regulate” and “importation” are read in context.  As the Supreme Court has held, \n12  “[i]t is a fundamental canon of statutory construction that the words of a statute must be read in \n13  their context and with a view to their place in the overall statutory scheme.”  West Virginia v. \n14  EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 721 (2022).  Additionally, where a statute contains a list of words, parties and \n15  courts must read the entire list in context and may not just select “but one word in a list, a word [a \n16  party] reads altogether out of context,” and then “ascrib[e] to one word a meaning so broad that it \n17  is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving ‘unintended breadth to the Acts of \n18  Congress.’”  Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., Inc., 513 U.S. 561, 574-75 (1995); accord, e.g., Maner v. \n19  Dignity Health, 9 F.4th 1114, 1123 (9th Cir. 2021) (same).  And, of course, a given term \n20  “mean[s] the same thing throughout a statute.”  Brown v. Gardner, 513 U.S. 115, 118 (1994). \n21  “Regulate” is one entry in a list of eight emergency powers listed in IEEPA: \n22  [(1)] investigate, [(2)] block during the pendency of an investigation, [(3)] regulate, \n[(4)] direct and compel, [(5)] nullify, [(6)] void, [(7)] prevent or [(8)] prohibit[.] \n23   \n50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  “Importation” is one entry in a list of twelve activities to which those \n24 \nemergency powers can be applied: \n25 \nany [(1)] acquisition, [(2)] holding, [(3)] withholding, [(4)] use, [(5)] transfer, \n26  [(6)] withdrawal, [(7)] transportation, [(8)] importation or [(9)] exportation of, or \n[(10)] dealing in, or [(11)] exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or \n27  [(12)] transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country or a national \nthereof has any interest. \n28   \n \n  9   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

That \n2  meaning does not include tariffs or taxes, as reading the full list of activities readily demonstrates.  \n3  See Brown, 513 U.S. at 119-20 (rejecting government’s interpretation of statutory phrase where \n4  interpretation could not be applied to all items in statutory list without “incongruity”).  Consider, \n5  for example, “regulate . . . use.”  As a matter of plain English, this does not mean to tariff or tax \n6  use.  No one would say, for example, that to “regulate . . . use” of pesticides in organic food or \n7  chemicals in drinking water, or to “regulate . . . use” of confidential trade secrets or protected \n8  patient medical records, or to “regulate . . . use” of steroids in sporting events, etc., means to tariff \n9  or tax such use.  Instead, “regulate . . . use” means to control use or to fix the time, amount, \n10  degree, or rate of use.  Accord Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 596 U.S. at 697; Regulate, Black’s Law \n11  Dictionary (12th ed. 2024); Regulate, Black’s Law Dictionary 1156 (5th ed. 1979).  Likewise, \n12  “regulate . . . importation” means to control importation or fix its time, amount, degree, or rate, \n13  perhaps by limiting the times when imports can be brought in, or subjecting them to inspections.  \n14  It does not mean to tariff or tax importation.  This conclusion is further confirmed when one reads \n15  “regulate” in context with its list: the list of powers (in addition to the list of activities).  The other \n16  powers (block, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent, and prohibit) reflect an overall statutory \n17  scheme to control or restrict activities, not to tariff or tax them.  See Maner, 9 F.4th at 1123 \n18  (statutory list of words “should be assigned a permissible meaning that makes them similar”). \n19  Consider too the converse—suppose “regulate” were to include the power to impose tariffs \n20  or taxes.  That would mean that § 1702(a)(1)(B) provides for an immense and unheralded power \n21  to tariff or tax not just “importation” but all of the other activities listed in § 1702(a)(1)(B), i.e., \n22  the power to tax acquisitions, tax holdings, tax withholdings, tax use, tax exportation, etc., all of \n23  which are as much a part of the statute as importation is.  Nothing in IEEPA allows for so \n24  tremendous and unheralded a power, representing such a transformative expansion in presidential  \n25  authority with such a vast economic and political significance as this would be, through so  \n \n26  3 The Transfer Opposition characterized this as a list of eleven activities, reading importation and \nexportation as a single linked activity.  But it may be that the “or” in between them is meant to be \n27  part of the list of the first nine items together.  As the general statutory-interpretation principles \nare the same whether “importation” and “exportation” are linked specifically to each other or just \n28  linked as separate entries in the broader list, this brief assumes that they are separate entries. \n \n  10   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

Cf. Ala. \n2  Ass’n of Realtors v. HHS, 594 U.S. 758, 764-65 (2021). \n3  Defendants do not even try to construe “regulate” in a consistent way.  Instead, Defendants \n4  take the startling position that “regulate” “need not carry the same meaning” but instead can mean \n5  different things when paired with the different activities listed in § 1702(a)(1)(B).  Transfer Reply \n6  12; cf. Scribner v. WorldCom, Inc., 249 F.3d 902, 905 (9th Cir. 2001) (“‘When I use a word,’ \n7  Humpty Dumpty said in a rather scornful tone, ‘it means just what I choose it to mean—neither \n8  more nor less.’”) (quoting Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking Glass, in The Complete Works of \n9  Lewis Carroll 154, 196 (1994)).  Defendants fail to come up with a single case that supports such \n10  an audacious position.  Cf. Scribner, 249 F.3d at 905 (“[L]anguage is not infinitely elastic.”); \n11  Brown, 513 U.S. at 118 (a given term “mean[s] the same thing throughout a statute”); Gustafson, \n12  513 U.S. at 575 (a party may not “ascrib[e] to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent \n13  with its accompanying words, thus giving ‘unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress’”).4  \n14  Defendants’ claim that “regulate” means to tariff or tax when paired with “importation”—and \n15  only “importation”—flies in the face of the fundamental precepts of statutory construction. \n16  Defendants analogize their construction of § 1702(a)(1)(B) to section 232 of the Trade \n17  Expansion Act of 1962 (codified at 19 U.S.C. § 1862), but this argument falls flat.  Contra \n18  Transfer Reply 8-9.  The Trade Expansion Act is an entirely different statute that does not bear on \n19  the proper construction of IEEPA.  First and foremost amongst its differences is that the Trade \n20  Expansion Act expressly provides for tariffs and duties, whereas IEEPA contains no reference to \n21  tariffs or duties at all.  See Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-794, 576 Stat. 877 \n22  (1962).  Defendants focus on one snippet of section 232 that provides that if the Treasury \n23  Secretary finds that “an article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under \n24  such circumstances as to threaten to impair the national security,” the President is authorized  \n25  (subject to various statutory prerequisites) to take action to “adjust the imports of the article and  \n \n26  4 Defendants argue that “regulate” is a transitive verb that requires an object, Transfer Reply 12, \nbut that is entirely irrelevant—that a verb is transitive and requires an object does not mean it can \n27  change its meaning depending on what that object is.  Cf., e.g., Astrue v. Ratliff, 560 U.S. 586, \n592-93 (2010) (noting how the word “award” as used in statute was a “transitive verb” but \n28  nonetheless holding that it had a “settled meaning”) \n \n  11   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

Energy Admin. v. Algonquin SNG, \n5  Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 562 (1976)), and claim that this must mean that IEEPA’s reference to \n6  “regulate . . . importation” necessarily authorizes the President to impose tariffs as well.  \n7  Ironically, Defendants thus simultaneously try to argue that (1) the single word “regulate” within \n8  a single statute (IEEPA) means different things, Transfer Reply 12, while claiming that (2) the \n9  different words “regulate” versus “adjust” across two wholly different statutes (IEEPA versus the \n10  Trade Expansion Act) mean the same thing, id. at 8.  But accepting that the phrase “adjust . . . \n11  imports” might provide for imposing tariffs when used in a statute that devotes dozens of sections \n12  to discussing tariffs, does not establish that the entirely different phrase “regulate . . . importation” \n13  provides for imposing tariffs when used in a wholly different statute (IEEPA) that contains no \n14  mention of tariffs whatsoever.  See, e.g., United States v.

Additionally, the sentence of the Trade Expansion Act that Defendants cite \n18  contains only one verb, “adjust,” and only one object for that verb, “imports.”  The sentence of \n19  IEEPA that Defendants cite, by contrast, contains eight powers paired with twelve activities, and \n20  the meanings of those various powers and activities must be consistent across that sentence.  As \n21  discussed, there is no internally consistent way to construe the word “regulate” or “regulate . . . \n22  importation” in the context in § 1702(a)(1)(B) and within IEEPA’s statutory scheme, to hold that \n23  “regulate” authorizes tariffs or taxes on imports (or, at the very least, without holding that it also \n24  authorizes tariffs and taxes on acquisitions, holdings, use, exportations, etc., as well). \n25  In a last-ditch effort to claim that “regulate” as used in § 1702(a)(1)(B) authorizes tariffs or \n26   \n5 The statutory prerequisites include that the Commerce Secretary must conduct an investigation, \n27  hold public hearings, allow interested parties an opportunity to be heard, and publish a report on \nhis findings in the Federal Register.  19 U.S.C. § 1862(b)-(c).

United States, 289 U.S. 48, \n4  58 (1933)).  But “regulate,” when used in a statute, carries its plain English meaning, not the full \n5  scope of “regulate” as used in the Commerce Clause.  See Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, 596 U.S. at 697 \n6  (construing “regulate” in the context of a statute by reference to dictionaries, not the Commerce \n7  Clause).  If “regulate” as used in § 1702(a)(1)(B) really were equivalent to “regulate” as used in \n8  the Commerce Clause, it would render the listing of all of the other powers in § 1702(a)(1)(B) \n9  (“block,” “prevent,” “prohibit,” etc.) wholly superfluous, because the power to “regulate” under \n10  the Commerce Clause already encompasses those powers.  Cf. Fischer v. United States, 603 U.S. \n11  480, 490 (2024) (rejecting construing one item in statutory list so broadly that it would cover all \n12  other items in list as well).  More fundamentally, Defendants’ attempt to equate “regulate” as \n13  used in § 1702(a)(1)(B) with “regulate” as used in the Commerce Clause ignores the fundamental \n14  difference between the two provisions and, indeed, between the different branches of government.  \n15  The Commerce Clause power to “regulate” is the power to write laws to regulate, i.e., the power \n16  to legislate.  By contrast, the President and the Executive Branch are not lawmakers.  Youngstown \n17  Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952).  And “Congress may not constitutionally \n18  delegate its legislative power to another branch of Government,” Touby v. United States, 500 U.S. \n19  160, 165 (1991), and much less may the Executive Branch seize such power from Congress.6  \n20  That Defendants must resort to claiming that their power to “regulate” as set forth in \n21  § 1702(a)(1)(B) is equivalent to Congress’s power to “regulate” as set forth in the Commerce \n22  Clause, does not establish that § 1702(a)(1)(B) provides for tariffs—to the contrary, it only \n23  highlights how Defendants’ position violates the constitutional separation of powers. \n24  B.

Nothing in the legislative history of IEEPA or its predecessor, the \n2  Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA), supports that either Act authorized the imposition of \n3  tariffs.  Defendants’ reference to the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 provides for a stark \n4  comparison.  The Supreme Court held that Trade Expansion Act’s reference to “adjust . . . \n5  imports” authorized tariffs only after reviewing the legislative history of that Act and seeing how \n6  that history was rife with express discussions of tariffs and evinced a congressional intent to have \n7  the “adjust . . . imports” phrase in that Act include the power to impose tariffs.  Algonquin, 426 \n8  U.S. at 562-67.  There is nothing comparable in the legislative history of IEEPA or the TWEA. \n9  C.  The Major-Questions Doctrine and the Doctrine of Constitutional Avoidance \nConfirm IEEPA Does Not Authorize Tariffs \n10 \nBecause the plain statutory language of IEEPA and its legislative history confirm that \n11 \nIEEPA does not authorize tariffs, the Court need not even reach the major-questions doctrine or \n12 \nthe doctrine of constitutional avoidance.  But were the Court to do so, these doctrines also \n13 \nconfirm that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  See Transfer Opp’n 14-15, 18-19. \n14 \nFirst, the major-questions doctrine provides that where (1) Executive Branch action is \n15 \n“unheralded” and represents a “transformative expansion” in the Executive’s authority in the \n16 \nvague language of a long-extant, but rarely used, statute, and (2) the Executive’s action is of “vast \n17 \neconomic and political significance” and “extraordinary” enough to trigger the doctrine, courts \n18 \nshould greet the Executive’s assertion of authority with “skepticism” and require the Executive to \n19 \nidentify “clear congressional authorization” for its action.  Nebraska v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 14 (9th \n20 \nCir. 2024).  That standard is satisfied here.  President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders are \n21 \nunheralded—no President in history has ever issued an order invoking IEEPA or its predecessor \n22 \n(the TWEA) to impose tariffs.  Transfer Opp’n 5-6 & n.1.  The Orders are a transformative \n23 \nexpansion in Executive authority based on a long-extant statute that has never before been used \n24 \nthis way.  Id.  And the Orders have vast economic and political significance with extraordinary \n25 \neffects.  See, e.g., Clausing ¶¶ 10, 21-48; York ¶¶ 51-65.  And there is no clear congressional \n26 \nauthorization for such action, as IEEPA does not breathe a word about tariffs.

It is hard to \n4  imagine a more unclear authorization than one that hinges on a word (“regulate”) that does not \n5  keep a consistent meaning even within its own sentence.  Cf. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 732 \n6  (rejecting government’s attempt to pluck single word out of statute and define it so broadly that it \n7  could mean “almost anything,” “shorn of all context,” leaving the word “an empty vessel”); Ala. \n8  Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764-75 (generally same).7 \n9  Defendants try to argue that the major-questions doctrine does not apply to actions by the \n10  President, as opposed to other Executive Branch officials.  Transfer Reply 11.  But the Supreme \n11  Court has never held this, and every Court of Appeals that has confronted the issue has applied \n12  the major-questions doctrine equally to actions by the President as any other Executive Branch \n13  official or agency.  See Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th 1017, 1031 n.40 (5th Cir. 2022); Kentucky v. \n14  Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 606-08 (6th Cir. 2022); Georgia v.

Spawr Optical Rsch., \n22  Inc., 685 F.2d 1076, 1081 n.10 (9th Cir. 1982)).  But in actuality, Spawr never once mentions \ntariffs and had nothing to do with tariffs at all.  It instead dealt with a prohibition on the export of \n23  laser mirrors to the Soviet Union without a license, where the Ninth Circuit held that the powers \nlisted in the TWEA to “regulate,” “prevent,” and “prohibit” exportation authorized this \n24  restriction.  Spawr, 685 F.2d at 1078-81 & n.10.  Whether the statutory language to “regulate,” \n“prevent,” and “prohibit” exportation is sufficiently clear so to authorize the restriction there does \n25  not establish that the word “regulate” (alone) is sufficiently clear so as to authorize the wholly \ndifferent Executive action of imposing tariffs or taxes, much less tariffs or taxes as unheralded, \n26  transformative, and vast and significant as President Trump’s IEEPA Tariff Orders here. \n27  8 The only Court of Appeals decision to hold to the contrary, Mayes v.

But this is a non sequitur, as all cases involving the major-\n8  questions doctrine are about prerogatives of Congress and the President or Executive Branch, by \n9  definition: the doctrine concerns how those prerogatives are delegated and divided between those \n10  branches of government, which Defendants’ inapposite case cites do not address.9 \n11  Nor does Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649 (1892), support Defendants—if \n12  anything, it undermines their position.  The Supreme Court reaffirmed there that “Congress \n13  cannot delegate legislative power to the President,” including its legislative tariff power.  Id. at \n14  692.  In that case, Congress enacted a law providing that certain U.S. free-trade rules would be \n15  suspended if other countries imposed duties on U.S. goods.  Id.  “Congress itself prescribed, in \n16  advance, the duties to be levied, collected, and paid, on sugar, molasses, coffee, tea or hides . . . \n17  while the suspension lasted.  Nothing involving the expediency or the just operation of such \n18  legislation was left to the determination of the President.”  Id. at 692-93.  The President’s only \n19  role was to determine when other countries imposed tariffs on U.S. goods—after that, he had no \n20  discretion as to what tariffs to impose (or raise or suspend), as all of those decisions were \n21  properly the purview of Congress, not the President.  Id. at 693 (“Legislative power was exercised \n22  when Congress declared that the suspension should take effect upon a named contingency.

Marshall Field in no way supports the \n2  premise that IEEPA delegated to the President the power to legislate what tariffs to impose, or \n3  when, much less that it could do so through so unclear a provision as “regulate . . . importation.”10 \n4  Second, were there any ambiguity in whether IEEPA authorizes tariffs or not, the doctrine \n5  of constitutional avoidance requires the Court to interpret IEEPA such that it does not authorize \n6  tariffs, to avoid the significant constitutional questions that would arise if it did. \n7  If, as Defendants posit, § 1702(a)(1)(B)’s reference to “regulate . . . importation” authorizes \n8  tariffs on imports, “regulate . . . exportation” must authorize tariffs on exports too.  Contrary to \n9  Defendants’ position, they cannot be simply separated, with “regulate” meaning something \n10  different when applied to one versus the other.  See West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 721; Gustafson, \n11  513 U.S. at 574-75; Brown, 513 U.S. at 118; Maner, 9 F.4th at 1123; contra Transfer Reply 12.  \n12  And it is indisputable that the Constitution prohibits tariffs on exports.  U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, \n13  cl. 5; United States v. U.S. Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360, 363 (1998).  Thus, if IEEPA authorizes \n14  tariffs on imports, it also necessarily authorizes tariffs on exports—and thus is unconstitutional.11  \n15  Defendants’ claim that the Export Clause does not bar “user fees,” Transfer Reply 13 (citing U.S. \n16  Shoe, 523 U.S. at 363), does not help them.  To constitute a permissible “user fee” as opposed to \n17  an impermissible tariff, the fee must be to compensate the government for services that it \n18  rendered and must bear relation to the value of those services.  U.S. Shoe, 523 U.S. at 369-70 \n19  (holding that an ad valorem charge was an unconstitutional tariff and not a permissible user fee).  \n20  If § 1702(a)(1)(B)’s reference to “regulate” authorizes tariffs or taxes beyond these limited user \n21  fees, IEEPA is unconstitutional.  Conversely, if “regulate” is limited to user fees, President \n22   \n10 Florsheim Shoe Co. v. United States, 744 F.2d 787 (Fed. Cir. 1984) (cited by Transfer Reply \n23  11), similarly has no bearing here, as it involved a statute that expressly authorized the President \nto “withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of [] duty-free treatment” based on various factors, \n24  including whether other countries “are extending generalized preferential tariff treatment to such \ncountry.”  Id. at 792 & n.8.  Whether a statute that expressly says it authorizes the President to \n25  suspend duty-free treatment and thereby impose tariffs is clear enough to authorize the President \nto impose tariffs, does not establish that IEEPA—which, by contrast, never once mentions \n26  tariffs—is a clear enough congressional authorization for the President to do so. \n27  11 This is true even before examining whether a construction of “regulate” that authorizes tariffs \nand taxes, when applied to the other activities in § 1702(a)(1)(B)—e.g., acquisition, holding, \n28  withholding, use, transfer, etc.—would also be unconstitutional. \n \n  17   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

Defendants offer \n2  no coherent response on this point, other than to try to handwave the issue away by claiming that \n3  exportation is not squarely presented by this case.  Transfer Reply 13.  But Defendants cannot \n4  artificially cabin this case and claim it involves only the phrase “regulate . . . importation” \n5  (Defendants’ ellipsis inserted), to the exclusion of everything else.  This case squarely presents \n6  the question, what does “regulate” mean?  The question of whether construing “regulate” as \n7  authorizing tariffs violates the Constitution, whether the Export Clause or any other clause, is \n8  squarely presented here.  And because Defendants’ construction would violate the Export Clause, \n9  the doctrine of constitutional avoidance weighs against it, in lieu of a construction that does not \n10  implicate similar constitutional concerns—namely, that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. \n11  D.  The Yoshida Case Does Not Establish That IEEPA Authorizes Tariffs \n12  IEEPA’s plain language, its statutory history, and the major-questions doctrine and the \n13  doctrine of constitutional avoidance all confirm that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  Because \n14  all of these factors weigh against them, Defendants rely heavily on the non-binding decision in \n15  Yoshida, 526 F.2d 560.  But Yoshida is inapplicable here for numerous reasons and does not \n16  establish that IEEPA authorizes tariffs.  See Transfer Opp’n 19-22 & n.8, \n17  Significantly, the tariffs at issue in Yoshida—which President Nixon imposed not under \n18  IEEPA (which did not exist at that point) or its predecessor, the TWEA, but instead imposed only \n19  under the Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, see Proclamation No. 4074, \n20  36 Fed. Reg. 15,724 (Aug. 17, 1971)—did not apply to all imports across the board.  Yoshida, \n21  526 F.2d at 577.  Instead, the limited issue there was the reductions or removals of certain tariff \n22  concessions, which could bring tariffs back up to the levels that had been authorized by Congress, \n23  but which expressly were not permitted to exceed the levels that Congress had authorized.  Id. at \n24  577-78.  Yoshida thus does not establish that the TWEA (much less IEEPA) authorizes a \n25  President any freestanding power to impose tariffs or taxes beyond those that Congress has \n26  expressly approved.  Cf. id. at 578 (discussing how the “limited surcharge” imposed by \n27  Proclamation 4074 that was the subject of the Yoshida decision was “quite different from \n28 \n \n  18   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

In 1974, while Yoshida was still being litigated and the CCPA \n5  had yet to issue its decision, Congress enacted a new statute—the Trade Act of 1974—that \n6  contained a section (section 122) that specifically provided express statutory authorization for \n7  tariffs of the type that were at issue in Yoshida.13  Compare 36 Fed. Reg. 15,724 (tariffs were for \n8  balance-of-payment purposes) with Trade Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-617, § 122, 88 Stat. 1978 \n9  (1975) (providing express statutory authorization for tariffs to address balance-of-payment \n10  deficits).  Yoshida itself noted as much, holding that any future tariffs of this type would have to \n11  comply with the requirements of this new law.  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 582 n.33.  The fact that \n12  Congress enacted a new statutory provision expressly authorizing the type of tariffs at issue in \n13  Yoshida confirms that the preexisting TWEA did not authorize such tariffs—if it had, the new \n14  provision would have been superfluous.  See, e.g., Su, 121 F.4th at 13 (rejecting government’s \n15  claim that statute that provides President with authority to implement policies he “considers \n16  necessary” allows President to impose minimum wage for federal contractors in light of fact that \n17  Congress enacted more specific statutes that authorize express minimum-wage mandates).  And \n18  when IEEPA adopted the TWEA’s language, it did not adopt any power to impose tariffs, \n19  because Congress never agreed that such power existed in the TWEA to begin with.14  Since the \n20   \n12 And even if Yoshida were not so limited, it would be unpersuasive.  Like Defendants, Yoshida \n21  focused only on “regulate . . . importation,” 526 F.2d at 573, and did not follow the Supreme \nCourt maxims that control now that require courts to examine those words in their full context.  \n22  See, e.g., West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 721; Gustafson, 513 U.S. at 574.  Yoshida also does not \naddress the major-questions doctrine (which had not been articulated at the time), nor does it \n23  sufficiently grapple with the doctrine of constitutional avoidance.  See Transfer Opp’n 22-23. \n24  13 By the time of the Yoshida litigation, the actual tariffs had been rescinded.  Proclamation No. \n4098, 36 Fed. Reg. 24,201 (Dec. 22, 1971).  Congress nonetheless included in the Trade Act of \n25  1974 a section providing express statutory authorization for that type of tariff going forward. \n26  14 While the House Committee writing the bill that would become IEEPA was aware that Yoshida \nhad reversed a lower court decision holding that the TWEA did not authorize tariffs, H.R. Rep. \n27  No. 95-459, at 5 (1977), it expressly did not “either endors[e] or disclaim[]” prior uses of the \nTWEA, see id. at 10, and instead characterized the powers that were being transferred from the \n28  TWEA to IEEPA as being the powers regulate financial transactions and to freeze foreign \n  \n  19   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

California is thus confronted with the impossible choice of accepting significant price \n16  increases in order to retain access to these essential goods or to try to re-procure on a vast scale, \n17  and then facing the real possibility of being unable to source alternative goods.  See Shell ¶¶ 9-13, \n18  15-16; see Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017) (placing \n19  funds in reserve and making cuts to services are irreparable harms).   \n20  Unlike a business, the State does not have the option to simply pass the price of the tariffs \n21  to customers in an effort to mitigate its losses.  Instead, the State must absorb those losses and \n22  face the budgetary consequences.  Shell ¶ 15; see id. ¶¶ 9, 11 (vendors have already notified State \n23  of increased prices), id. ¶¶ 10, 12 (tariffs expected to pose financial harm and increase cost of  \n24  procurement and renegotiating contracts will most likely result in higher prices for goods). \n \n25  property transactions—with no mention of the power to impose tariffs, id. at 14-15; accord S. \nRep.

See BP P.L.C. v. Mayor of Balt., 141 S.

Background III; see also Shell ¶ 9 (State has \n4  “expended considerable effort and numerous work hours in the past months” in anticipation of \n5  tariff-related shortages).  For example, California ports account for 17% of overall U.S. imports, \n6  and imports from China account for a quarter of all imports into California.  York ¶ 57.  Already, \n7  the Port of Los Angeles lost a third of its import volume in the first week of May because of the \n8  tariffs.  Clausing ¶ 34; Background III.  It is not just consumers who will feel the pain from empty \n9  shelves: the State stands to lose its supply of necessary goods as well, goods that allow it to \n10  provide essential services to the people of California such as products to assist public school \n11  student with disabilities, Bradley ¶ 6, vital hospital supplies, Bignami ¶ 6, raw materials for \n12  roadway projects, office furniture, or even fuel, Shell ¶ 7.  California is already seeing vendors \n13  seeking to increase contract prices, even when already-agreed-upon contracts are in place, and \n14  anticipates many more, and has no way to avoid those increases.  Id. ¶¶ 9, 11-13; Background III.  \n15  And when State departments have mandatory contracts for certain goods, they cannot procure \n16  them on the open market, leaving the departments no other option but to pay any tariff-related \n17  price increase for goods in those contracts.  Shell ¶¶ 3, 10.  \n18  B.  Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Injury From Lost Revenue \n19  California also stands to lose tax revenue that will damage its economy and have a \n20  profound impact not remediable by monetary damages.  California will lose significant personal \n21  income tax and corporate revenue as a result of the tariffs’ impact on California taxpayers and \n22  revenue from corporate profits.  York ¶ 16.  The Department of Finance forecast a loss of $1.6 \n23  billion in tax revenue from the projected negative impact of the tariffs on the growth rate of \n24  economic wages and proprietor income.  White ¶ 6.  Capital-gains revenue—a significant portion \n25  of California’s personal income-tax revenue—is projected to fall by $4.5 billion because of \n26  volatility and decline in the S&P 500 due to these tariffs.  Id. ¶ 7.  Corporate tax revenue is \n27  forecast to fall $1.7 billion as a result in the tariffs, due to downgrades in projected corporate \n28  profit growth.  Id. ¶ 5.  These decreases alone come to a staggering $7.8 billion loss to the State’s \n \n  21   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim. Inj.

Steak N Shake Enters., Inc., \n2  695 F.3d 676, 680 (7th Cir. 2012) (irreparable harm where evidence presented that challenged \n3  policy would “negatively affect [plaintiff’s] revenue, possibly even to a considerable extent”). \n4  The loss in revenue from personal income tax comes from two sources: reduced wages and \n5  increased unemployment.  Workforce loss means less taxable wages available for State revenue \n6  because unemployed workers do not have personal income for the State to tax.  The challenged \n7  tariffs inflict a real threat of workforce reductions at California’s ports.  As the country’s largest \n8  importer and second largest exporter, California’s ports account for much of the country’s import \n9  needs, and many people and businesses rely on international trade for their livelihoods.  Clausing \n10  ¶ 38.  California also imports more from China than any other country, so it will be “particularly \n11  harmed” by the China tariffs.  Id.  Even a 1% decline in cargo volume—a conservative \n12  estimate—at the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach—two of California’s twelve \n13  ports—would result in the loss of more than 2,700 jobs.  York ¶ 57; see also Clausing ¶ 34 (Port \n14  of Los Angeles has already seen a one-third decline in import volume in the first week of May).  \n15  In addition to the price increases for products purchased by California in its ordinary course \n16  of business, this loss of tax revenue forces Plaintiffs to reallocate resources from their policy \n17  priorities and use available revenue to pay for price increases and fulfill its budgetary obligations. \n18  Injuries where “sovereign interests and public policies [are] at stake” are irreparable.  Kansas v. \n19  United States, 249 F.3d 1213, 1227 (10th Cir. 2001).  But the injury to public policy does not stop \n20  there.  The Governor’s policy priorities include, for example, building more housing, making \n21  healthcare more affordable, and bettering equal access to the economy.15  The tariffs and their on-\n22  again-off-again implementation threaten the Governor and California’s reputation as a reliable \n23  trade partner and stymie the Governor’s ability to enact and effectuate the Legislature’s \n24  prerogatives.  See Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 20 (1st Cir. 1996) \n25  (“By its very nature injury to goodwill and reputation is not easily measured or fully compensable \n26  in damages[,]” and “is often held to be irreparable.”). \n27   \n15 Priorities and Progress: Priorities, Governor Gavin Newsom, https://www.gov.ca.gov/\n28  priorities-and-progress/priorities/ (last visited May 11, 2025). \n \n  22   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

Plaintiffs Face Irreparable Injury From the Unpredictable, Ever-Changing \nTariff Landscape \n2 \nThe extraordinary loss of essential revenue is exacerbated by the unpredictable and ever-\n3 \nchanging status of the tariffs, which has made it extremely difficult for California to budget and \n4 \nplan.  See, e.g., Shell ¶¶ 21-22 (State budget, “a critical and time-intensive process” to create, \n5 \n“will no longer be a reliable financial and internal control tool” and ever-changing tariffs “makes \n6 \nit impossible for State agencies to abide by their legislatively approved budgets”).  The harm \n7 \nfrom the uncertainty of the IEEPA tariffs is only highlighted by the President’s May 12 \n8 \nannouncement that tariffs on China will be lowered from 145% to 30% for 90 days.  While the \n9 \npause offers some temporary reprieve, Plaintiffs do not know how long the pause will last—\n10 \ntariffs on Mexico and Canada were paused, but then were reinstated.  York ¶¶ 30, 32; Clausing ¶ \n11 \n40 n.40.  Under the President’s claimed authority under IEEPA, there is nothing to stop him from \n12 \nreinstating the 145% tariffs tomorrow.  In the face of these tariffs, California’s choices are “to pay \n13 \nhigher costs than what is stated in the contract, amend thousands of contracts to allow for higher \n14 \ncosts solely due to tariffs, or cancel all contracts and begin re-procuring for every contract hit by \n15 \ntariffs even though that means agencies will be left without access to critically needed supplies \n16 \nand still not be able to procure goods at a price on par with the previous contracted price.”  Shell \n17 \n¶ 23.  It is exactly these irreparable harms—which Plaintiffs are currently suffering—that \n18 \nPlaintiffs seek to address with a preliminary injunction.   \n19 \n The “schizophrenic approach to” imposing tariffs that are not approved by Congress or \n20 \nauthorized by law has made it extremely difficult for the California and its agencies to effectively \n21 \n“budget, plan for the future, and properly serve their residents,” which constitutes irreparable \n22 \nharm.  Santa Clara, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 537, 526 (loss of federal grants has a “real and concrete \n23 \nimpact[] on the Counties’ ability to budget and plan for the future.”).  California must “make \n24 \ncontingency plans” to deal with the ever-changing landscape, including deciding whether to \n25 \n“plac[e] funds in a budget reserve in lieu of spending that money on needed programs,” raising \n26 \nconcerns about its “obligation to mitigate potential harm to [its] residents” and to avoid making \n27 \n“drastic cuts to services.”  Id.; see Bignami ¶ 7 (discussing delays in purchase, receipt, or \n28 \n \n  23   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

Such a “diversion of \n7  resources” is an irreparable harm when those resources cannot be recovered.  Louisiana, 55 F.4th \n8  at 1033.  This is true here as the State cannot recover the “staff time and organizational resources” \n9  expended by having “to divert resources away from its core programs to address the new [tariff] \n10  policy” and the imminent loss of financial resources as a result of the tariffs.  E. Bay Sanctuary \n11  Covenant v. Biden, 993 F.3d 640, 678 (9th Cir. 2021); see City & Cnty. of S.F. v. USCIS, 981 \n12  F.3d 742, 762 (9th Cir. 2020) (irreparable harm where plaintiffs “likely are bearing and will \n13  continue to bear heavy financial costs” because of federal policy change and “because of the \n14  unavailability of monetary damages”).  These “consequence[s] of having to divert resources and \n15  personnel to accommodate the shifting [tariff] landscape” have cascading effects on the State’s \n16  ability to effectively and efficiently implement its many public programs.  Maryland v. U.S. Dep’t \n17  of Agric., __ F. Supp. 3d __, No. JKB-25-0748, 2025 WL 973159, at *31 (D. Md. Apr. 1, 2025), \n18  appeal docketed, No. 25-1338 (4th Cir. Apr. 3, 2025).  California has already diverted significant \n19  resources to assess, react, and respond to tariff issues with vendors and find alternative goods.  \n20  Shell ¶ 19; see also id. ¶ 12 (significant resources spent on conducting market analyses), ¶ 15 \n21  (burden of re-soliciting contracts terminated because of tariffs); Background III. \n22  D.  Plaintiffs’ Harms Cannot Be Redressed By Order for Damages \n23  Economic harm is considered irreparable when “the state[] will not be able to recover \n24  monetary damages connected to” the challenged action—here, the tariffs.  Azar, 911 at 581. \n25  It is administratively infeasible to collect damages to recoup the monetary harm California \n26  is experiencing from the challenged tariffs.  Recovery of any tariffs would likely mean litigating \n27  individual claims for recovery, or at least would require the State to negotiate and manage each of \n28  those claims, where the surcharges are paid across many state agencies and departments.

Typically, California’s subcontractors, vendors, and \n2  suppliers are the importers of record (not California itself) meaning that they would receive any \n3  tariff reimbursement from CBP, and there is no effective mechanism for California to be made \n4  aware of the vendors’ challenges to paying the tariffs, much less any recovery.  Shell ¶¶ 14, 16.  \n5  Further, the impact on the State’s ability to provide resources to its citizens, and the diversion of \n6  resources to identifying tariff surcharge payments, will cause damage that will persist regardless \n7  of any subsequent monetary recovery.  Santa Clara, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 537. \n8  IV.  The Balance of Equities and the Public Interest Weigh in Favor of an Injunction \n9  The federal government cannot suffer harm and the public interest benefits from “an \n10  injunction that merely ends an unlawful practice or reads a statute as required to avoid \n11  constitutional concerns.”  Rodriguez v. Robbins, 715 F.3d 1127, 1145 (9th Cir. 2013).  Where, as \n12  here, Defendants are acting unlawfully, in excess of statutory authority, and in violation of the \n13  constitutional separation of powers, the public interest and balance of equities necessarily favor a \n14  preliminary injunction.  See id.  Furthermore, the requested relief would serve the “basic function \n15  of a preliminary injunction” which is “to preserve the status quo ante litem pending a \n16  determination of the action on the merits.”  L.A. Mem’l Coliseum Comm’n v. NFL, 634 F.2d 1197, \n17  1200 (9th Cir. 1980); see FCA, 82 F.4th at 684-85 (status quo is status prior to government’s \n18  change in policy).  Both Plaintiffs and the public have a profound interest in maintaining the \n19  status quo where, as here, the President’s unprecedented tariffs have caused cataclysmic impacts \n20  on the entire global economy, and have an “outsized” impact on California.  York Decl. ¶ 60; see \n21  also Clausing Decl. ¶ 10 (“If continued, the tariffs would generate enormous economic damage to \n22  both the U.S. economy and the California economy”); see, e.g., League of Wilderness Defs./Blue \n23  Mountains Biodiversity Project v. Connaughton, 752 F.3d 755, 766 (9th Cir. 2014) (the public \n24  interest inquiry addresses the impact on non-parties).  In light of the staggering effects of the \n25  President’s unlawful IEEPA tariffs, the public interest and balance of equities tip sharply in favor \n26  of preserving the status quo through a preliminary injunction. \n27  CONCLUSION \n28  The Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction. \n \n  25   \n \nPls.’ Mot. for Prelim.

The President, acting under IEEPA, has regulated imports by imposing tariffs on goods \n15  from most countries through a series of Executive Orders, to deal with unusual and extraordinary threats \n16  to the United States’s national security, foreign policy, and economy.   \n17  Plaintiffs challenge the President’s authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA, on both \n18  constitutional and statutory grounds.  But all of plaintiffs’ arguments concern the imposition of tariffs—\n19  over which the Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) .  Section \n20  1631 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code requires transfer when there is “a want of jurisdiction” in the original \n21  court and where the action could have been brought in another court.  Because the Court of International \n22  Trade has exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter in plaintiffs’ complaint, the case should be \n23  transferred to that court for any further proceedings, including any threshold challenges.  The Ninth \n24  Circuit has held cases involving tariffs under IEEPA’s materially identical predecessor statute cannot be \n25  litigated in federal district courts.  In addition, exercising jurisdiction over this case would place this \n26  Court at odds with the Court of International Trade, which is presently exercising jurisdiction over two \n27  cases challenging President Trump’s tariffs issued under IEEPA. \n28   \n  DEFS.’ MOT. TO TRANSFER TO CT. INT’L TRADE \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  1 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 9     Filed 04/17/25     Page 9 of 20\n \n1  BACKGROUND \n2  I.  Legal Background \n3  A.  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n4  In 1977, Congress enacted IEEPA.  See S. Rep. No. 95-466, at 1–2 (1977), reprinted in 1977 \n5  U.S.C.C.A.N. 4540, 4541.  When adopting IEEPA, Congress modified the existing Trading with the \n6  Enemy Act (TWEA) so that it applied only in periods of war, but also extended the President’s authority \n7  to periods of declared national emergencies.  See Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 227–28 (1984).  \n8  Although the broad powers granted to the President under IEEPA are “essentially the same as” those \n9  under its predecessor TWEA, id.; see Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 U.S. 654, 671–72 (1981) (IEEPA \n10  was “directly drawn” from the language of TWEA), IEEPA provides authority to exercise those powers \n11  during peacetime, “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or \n12  substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the \n13  United States,” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).  Once the President declares a national emergency relating to such \n14  a threat, IEEPA empowers the President to “regulate . . . importation . . . with respect to any property, \n15  subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.”  Id. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  In full, the relevant subsection \n16  authorizes the President to: \n17  [R]egulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any \nacquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, \n18  transportation, importation or exportation  of, or dealing in, or exercising \nany right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving, \n19  any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any \ninterest . . . with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the \n20  United States[.] \n \n21  Id.  IEEPA also contains narrowly focused exceptions to this broad grant of authority, which, among \n22  other things, state that the President may not regulate or prohibit “the importation from any country . . . \n23  of any information or informational materials . . ..”  Id. §1702(b)(1)–(4).  But none of the exceptions \n24  involves the President’s authority to impose tariffs to deal with a declared national emergency. \n25  B.  The National Emergencies Act \n26  The National Emergencies Act, Pub. L. No. 94-412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976) (codified as amended \n27  at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–51), was an effort by Congress to “establish procedural guidelines for the handling \n28  of future emergencies with provision for regular Congressional review.”  S. Rep. No. 94-922, at 1 \n  DEFS.’ MOT. TO TRANSFER TO CT. INT’L TRADE \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  2 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 9     Filed 04/17/25     Page 10 of 20\n \n1  (1976). The statute includes directives for Presidential declarations of national emergencies with respect \n2  to statutes “authorizing the exercise, during the period of a national emergency, of any special or \n3  extraordinary power.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  Congress did not place any conditions on the President’s \n4  ability to declare a national emergency.  Instead, Congress committed this determination to the President \n5  as “it would be wrong to try to circumscribe with words what conditions a President might be \n6  confronted.”  Nat’l Emergencies Act: Hr’gs Before the Subcomm. on Admin. Law and Governmental \n7  Relations, 94th Cong. 27 (Mar. 6, 1975) (statement of Sen. Mathias); see also id. at 31 (“[W]e didn’t \n8  attempt to define it specifically because we were afraid we would circumscribe the President’s \n9  constitutional powers.”); id. at 27 (statement of Sen. Church) (similar). \n10  Recognizing that a declaration of an emergency was essentially a political question to be \n11  resolved by the political branches, Congress gave itself the exclusive oversight authority over a \n12  President’s national emergency declaration.  For instance, Congress directs that a declaration of a \n13  national emergency be “immediately . . . transmitted to the Congress and published in the Federal \n14  Register.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  Congress also directs the President to comply with congressional \n15  reporting requirements pertaining to that declaration.  Id. § 1641(a)–(c).  Congress may terminate a \n16  national emergency through a joint resolution that is subject to fast-track procedures, and Congress is \n17  directed to meet “[n]ot later than six months after a national emergency is declared, and [every six \n18  months thereafter],” to consider whether the emergency shall be terminated.  Id. § 1622(a)–(c).  A \n19  declaration of a national emergency also “terminate[s] on the anniversary of the declaration” unless the \n20  President provides notice to Congress that the emergency “continue[s].”  Id. § 1662(d). \n21  II.  Executive Orders Under IEEPA \n22  At issue in this case are four declared national emergencies and the President’s actions to deal \n23  with these emergencies. \n24  A.  Mexico and Canada Executive Orders \n25  In January 2025, the President declared the flow of contraband drugs like fentanyl to the United \n26  States through illicit distribution networks, and the resulting public-health crisis, to be a national \n27  emergency.  Proclamation 10886 of January 20, 2025, Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern \n28  Border of the United States, 90 Fed. Reg. 8,327 (Jan. 29, 2025).

Executive Order 14193 of February 1, 2025, § 1, Imposing Duties to Address \n4  the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,113, 9,114 (Feb. 7, 2025).  Also \n5  on February 1, 2025, the President found that Mexico had “fail[ed] to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise \n6  intercept [drug-trafficking organizations], other drug and human traffickers, criminals at large, and illicit \n7  drugs.”  Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025, § 1, Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at \n8  Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117, 9,118 (Feb. 7, 2025). \n9  Using his broad powers under IEEPA, the President took action to deal with the unusual and \n10  extraordinary threat to the United States’s national security, foreign policy, and economy, ordering that \n11  most Canadian and Mexican imports be assessed a 25% duty (except for energy and energy resources \n12  from Canada, which were assessed a 10% duty).  Id.; Executive Order 14194 of February 1, 2025, \n13  Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117 (Feb. 7, 2025). \n14  Two days later, on February 3, 2025, the President issued two Executive Orders, recognizing that \n15  Canada and Mexico had taken immediate steps to alleviate the flow of illicit drugs and illegal aliens into \n16  the United States, but finding that additional time was needed to assess those steps’ sufficiency.  \n17  Executive Order 14197 of February 3, 2025, Progress on the Situation at Our Northern Border, 90 Fed. \n18  Reg. 9,183 (Feb. 10, 2025); Executive Order 14198 of February 3, 2025, Progress on the Situation at \n19  Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,185 (Feb. 10, 2025).  Accordingly, the President paused most of \n20  the tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods until March 4, 2025.  Id.   \n21  Shortly after that pause lapsed, the President issued two Executive Orders exempting all \n22  Canadian and Mexican goods that qualify for duty-free entry under the United States-Mexico-Canada \n23  Agreement (USMCA).  Executive Order 14231 of March 6, 2025, Amendment to Duties to Address the \n24  Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 11,785 (Mar. 11, 2025); Executive \n25  Order 14232 of March 6, 2025, Amendment to Duties To Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across Our \n26  Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 11,787 (Mar. 11, 2025).  As a result, only goods imported from Canada \n27  that are not USMCA-qualifying—generally, goods that do not originate from North America—are \n28  subject to the tariffs imposed by Executive Orders 14193 and 14194.

Reg. 11,746 \n13  (Mar. 11, 2025). \n14  B.  China Executive Orders \n15  On February 1, 2025, the President took additional action under IEEPA to specifically address \n16  the unusual and extraordinary threat from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including the PRC’s \n17  failures to stem the flow of contraband drugs to the United States.  Executive Order 14195 of February \n18  1, 2025, Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of \n19  China,  90 Fed. Reg. 9,121 (Feb. 7, 2025).  The President found that the PRC had failed “to arrest, seize, \n20  detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other [Transnational \n21  Criminal Organizations], criminals at large, and drugs.”  Id. at 9,122.  To address the national \n22  emergency, the President took “decisive and immediate action” under IEEPA and “decided to impose, \n23  consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles that are products of the PRC as set forth in this order.”  \n24  Id.   \n25  The President then imposed a 10% ad valorem duty rate on most goods imported from the PRC \n26  and authorized DHS to take any necessary actions to implement the order.  Id. at 9,122–23. DHS, \n27  through CBP, did so shortly thereafter.

Reg. 11,426 (Mar. 6, 2025) (implementing the 20% duty through amendments to the \n10  HTSUS set out in an Annex to the Federal Register notice). \n11  C.  Reciprocal Tariff Executive Orders \n12  On April 2, 2025, the President declared a separate national emergency, finding “that underlying \n13  conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and \n14  non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and \n15  consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual \n16  and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”  Executive Order \n17  14257 of April 2, 2025, Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That \n18  Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 \n19  (Apr. 7, 2025).   That threat, the President found, “has its source in whole or substantial part outside the \n20  United States in the domestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the \n21  global trading system.”  Id. \n22  In particular, these “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits” have “atrophied” our \n23  nation’s “domestic production capacity” to the point where, now, the United States’ “military readiness” \n24  and “national security posture” are “comprise[d]”—an “especially acute” emergency given “the recent \n25  rise in armed conflicts abroad.”  Id. at 15,044–55.  The Executive Order explains, for instance, that \n26  “because the United States has supplied so much military equipment to other countries, U.S. stockpiles \n27  of military goods are too low to be compatible with U.S. national defense interests.”  Id. at 15,043.  \n28  Additionally, “[i]ncreased reliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised U.S. economic \n  DEFS.’ MOT.

Id. at 15,045.  These duties took effect \n10  on April 5, 2025, with select countries having additional duties imposed on April 9.  Id.  Since the initial \n11  declaration, the President has twice taken additional actions that he deemed necessary and appropriate to \n12  address this national emergency, including raising the duty rate for Chinese products. Executive Order \n13  14266 of April 9, 2025, Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and \n14  Alignment, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,625 (Apr. 15, 2025); Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025, Amendment to \n15  Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People’s Republic of \n16  China, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,509 (Apr. 14, 2025). \n17  The 10% duty on most imported goods imposed on April 5, and the additional country-specific \n18  duties starting on April 9, do not currently apply to Canadian or Mexican goods.  Executive Order 14257 \n19  of April 2, 2025, Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That \n20  Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 \n21  (Apr. 7, 2025). \n22  III.  Plaintiffs’ Suit \n23  On April 16, 2025, plaintiffs, the State of California and Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, \n24  filed a complaint in this Court.  ECF No. 1.  The State of California, through its Attorney General, \n25  alleges it is harmed by the tariffs because they “put at risk [California’s] position as the fifth largest \n26  economy in the world . . . .”  Compl. ¶ 133.  Governor Newsom alleges he is harmed because the tariffs’ \n27  alleged effects on the State “directly impact [his] ability to deliver on his policy goals for all \n28  Californians.”  Id.   \n  DEFS.’ MOT.

As a remedy, plaintiffs ask the Court to:  (1) “[d]eclare” the challenged Executive Orders \n4  “unlawful and void, because they were issued ultra vires in excess of statutory authority and/or because \n5  they are unconstitutional and violate separation of powers . . . .,” id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ 1, and \n6  (2) “[e]njoin” the agency defendants from “taking any action to implement or enforce” the Orders, id. at \n7  Prayer for Relief ¶ 2.  Plaintiffs also seek fees and costs under the Equal Access to Justice Act.  Id. at \n8  Prayer for Relief ¶ 3. \n9  STANDARD OF REVIEW \n10  Federal courts have an obligation to ensure in each case that their actions are “limited to those \n11  subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of jurisdiction.” Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \n12  Compagnie Des Bauxites, 456 U.S. 694, 701 (1982).  A plaintiff bears the burden to establish the subject \n13  matter jurisdiction of the district court. Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994); \n14  FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).   \n15  Ninth Circuit “precedent requires courts faced with conflicts between the broad grants of \n16  jurisdiction to the district courts and the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International \n17  Trade to resolve those conflicts by upholding the exclusivity of the Court of International Trade’s \n18  jurisdiction.”  United States v. Universal Fruits & Vegetables Corp., 370 F.3d 829, 836 (9th Cir. 2004) \n19  (cleaned up).  Accordingly, when the Court of International Trade appears to have subject-matter \n20  jurisdiction over an action filed in district court, “the prudent thing to do is to . . . transfer the case to the \n21  [Court of International Trade,] so that [it] can determine the question of its own jurisdiction.”  Pentax \n22  Corp. v. Myhra, 72 F.3d 708, 711 (9th Cir. 1995).  Such transfer is accomplished through 28 U.S.C. \n23  § 1631, which provides that whenever a civil action is filed and a court finds “there is a want of \n24  jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action  . . . to any other such \n25  court . . . in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed . . . .”    \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  DEFS.’ MOT.

Transfer is Required Because the Court of International Trade Has Exclusive Subject-\nMatter Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Complaint \n3   \n4  This Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case and should promptly transfer it to the Court of \n5  International Trade. \n6  The Court of International Trade possesses “exclusive jurisdiction” over “any civil action \n7  commenced against” federal agencies or officers that “arises out of any law of the United States \n8  providing for . . . tariffs, duties, fees or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other \n9  than the raising of revenue” or under any law providing for “revenue from imports.”  28 U.S.C. § \n10  1581(i)(1)(A), (B).  The Court of International Trade also has exclusive jurisdiction over any civil action \n11  arising out of any law “providing for . . . administration and enforcement with respect to the matters \n12  referred to in” any preceding provision of § 1581(i)(1).  Id. § 1581(i)(1)(D).  To emphasize that the \n13  district courts lack concurrent jurisdiction over these specialized subject matters, Congress separately \n14  provided that “[t]he district courts shall not have jurisdiction under this section of any matter within the \n15  exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade . . . .”  Id. § 1337(c). \n16  The Supreme Court has confirmed that these statutes mean exactly what they say.  When one of \n17  the “grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade” applies, all other district courts \n18  are “divested of jurisdiction” over the action.  K-Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U.S. 176, 182–83 \n19  (1988).  Other courts (including the Ninth Circuit) similarly agree that “section 1581(i) removes \n20  specific actions from the general federal-question jurisdiction of the district courts (under 28 U.S.C. § \n21  1331) and places them in the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade.”  Orleans Int’l, Inc. v. \n22  United States, 334 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Conoco, Inc. v. U.S. Foreign-Trade Zones \n23  Bd., 18 F.3d 1581, 1586 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Pentax Corp., 72 F.3d at 711.  Thus, where Congress has \n24  provided that the Court of International Trade is the exclusive forum for challenges to tariffs imposed on \n25  imported merchandise, the district courts have no power to act.   \n26  The Court of International Trade’s exclusive jurisdiction over tariff cases serves an important \n27  function:  it consolidates this area of law “in one place . . . with an already developed expertise in \n28  international trade and tariff matters,” thus ensuring a “degree of uniformity and consistency.”  Conoco, \n  DEFS.’ MOT. TO TRANSFER TO CT. INT’L TRADE \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  9 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 9     Filed 04/17/25     Page 17 of 20\n \n1  18 F.3d at 1586.  Consolidating tariff matters in a single jurisdiction protects the constitutional \n2  requirement that “[a]ll Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States.”  \n3  U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1.  If tariff challenges like those raised by plaintiffs could be brought in any \n4  (or every) district court, there would be a risk of inconsistent results and different tariffs imposed in \n5  different regions of the country, in direct conflict with Congress’ statutory design.  Indeed, Congress has \n6  consistently placed judicial review of tariff matters in a single forum, beginning with the Board of \n7  Appraisers in 1890, see Customs Administration Act of 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131; then the Customs \n8  Court in 1926, see Act of May 28, 1926, ch. 411, 44 Stat. 669; and finally today’s Court of International \n9  Trade. \n10  Reflecting the exclusive jurisdiction statutes and their underlying purposes of ensuring \n11  uniformity, the Court of International Trade’s exclusive jurisdiction is broad, encompassing \n12  constitutional challenges to tariffs, duties, exactions, and embargoes.  See, e.g., U.S. Shoe Corp. v. \n13  United States, 523 U.S. 360 (1998) (constitutional challenge to Harbor Maintenance Fee); Totes-\n14  Isotoner Corp. v. United States, 594 F.3d 1346, 1350–51 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (constitutional challenge to \n15  Tariff Schedules of the United States); cf. Arjay Associates, Inc. v. Bush, 891 F.2d 894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) \n16  (constitutional challenge to embargo on imports from certain Japanese companies); see also \n17  Commodities Export Co. v. U.S. Customs Serv., 957 F.2d 223, 229–30 (6th Cir. 1992).  \n18  Its exclusive jurisdiction also includes challenges to Presidential proclamations imposing duties \n19  and tariffs.  See, e.g., Transpacific Steel LLC v. United States, 4 F.4th 1306 (Fed. Cir. 2021) \n20  (Presidential proclamation imposing tariffs on steel under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of \n21  1962); Solar Energy Indus. Assn. v. United States, 111 F.4th 1349, 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2024) (Presidential \n22  proclamation imposing tariffs on solar panels pursuant to Section 201 of Trade Act of 1974); Simon \n23  Design Inc. v. United States, 609 F.3d 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (Presidential proclamation modifying tariff \n24  schedules); Motion Systems Corp. v. Bush, 437 F.3d 1356 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en banc) (Presidential \n25  proclamation declining to impose China-specific safeguard tariff); Corus Group PLC v. Int’l Trade \n26  Comm’n, 352 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003) (Presidential proclamation imposing duties on certain steel \n27  products, based on Section 201); Maple Leaf Fish Co. v. United States, 762 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985) \n28  (Presidential proclamation imposing duties on mushrooms based on Section 201); See N. Am. Foreign \n  DEFS.’ MOT. TO TRANSFER TO CT.

Int’l Trade 1984) (upholding validity of \n2  Executive Order causing plaintiff’s goods to be classified under provision of the Tariff Schedules of the \n3  United States).  \n4  Here, plaintiffs challenge the President’s authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.  This question, \n5  including all threshold questions, falls squarely within the exclusive subject matter jurisdiction of the \n6  Court of International Trade because they arise out of laws providing for tariffs or the administration or \n7  enforcement of those laws.  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B), (D).  This Court thus lacks jurisdiction over the \n8  case and should transfer it to the Court of International Trade. \n9  This is precisely how similar cases have been treated in this Circuit.  Under TWEA (IEEPA’s \n10  predecessor statute), the Ninth Circuit held that a claim about the imposition of a 10% duty on imports \n11  belonged in the Customs Court—the predecessor to the Court of International Trade.  See Cornet \n12  Stores v. Morton, 632 F.2d 96, 99–100 (9th Cir. 1980) (affirming district court’s decision that claim \n13  seeking recovery of duties paid pursuant to order authorized under TWEA fell within exclusive \n14  jurisdiction of the Customs Court); accord Earth Island Institute v. Christopher, 6 F.3d 648, 651 (9th \n15  Cir. 1990) (holding that challenge to embargo provision fell exclusively within Court of International \n16  Trade’s jurisdiction under § 1581(i)).  Along the same lines, the Court of Customs and Patent \n17  Appeals—the Federal Circuit’s predecessor that heard appeals from the Customs Court—also \n18  adjudicated another TWEA matter brought in the right forum.  See, e.g., United States v. Yoshida Int’l, \n19  526 F.2d 560 (C.C.P.A. 1975); accord Alcan Sales, Div. of Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. United States, \n20  693 F.2d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1982). \n21  In fact, the Court of International Trade is currently considering two similar challenges to the \n22  President’s authority under IEEPA.  Barnes v. United States, No. 25-0043, ECF No. 3 (Compl.); V.O.S. \n23  Selections Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-00066, ECF No. 2 (Compl.).  In both cases, plaintiffs, like the State and \n24  the Governor here, claim that the President was not authorized to impose tariffs under IEEPA.  In \n25  V.O.S., the Court of International Trade has just assigned a three-judge panel to hear the case, under the \n26  statute directing the Chief Judge to \n27  designate any three judges of the court to hear and determine any civil \naction which the chief judge finds: (1) raises an issue of the \n28  constitutionality of an Act of Congress, a proclamation of the President or \nan Executive order; or (2) has broad or significant implications in the \n  DEFS.’ MOT. TO TRANSFER TO CT. INT’L TRADE \nNo. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC  11 \n \n\nCase 3:25-cv-03372-JSC     Document 9     Filed 04/17/25     Page 19 of 20\n \n1  administration or interpretation of the customs laws.   \n \n2  28 U.S.C. § 255 (emphasis added).  And while the United States has asked the court to dismiss the \n3  complaint in Barnes for lack of standing because Mr. Barnes has not established harm, for the reasons \n4  stated above, the consideration of whether to dismiss belongs exclusively to the Court of International \n5  Trade.  See Barnes, ECF No. 9.  Because the Court of International Trade’s jurisdiction over tariff cases \n6  is exclusive, this Court’s retention of this case would require the conclusion that the Court of \n7  International Trade has erred in exercising jurisdiction over both cases.  It would likewise conflict with \n8  the Ninth Circuit’s Cornet Stores transfer of a TWEA-based tariff case because the substantive language \n9  in TWEA and IEEPA is the same.  Both statutes empower the President to “regulate . . . importation.”  \n10  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B); see Cornet Stores, 632 F.2d at 97 & n.1. \n11  Moreover, over the last several years, the Court of International Trade has entertained thousands \n12  of challenges to various Presidential actions imposing tariffs.  See, e.g. HMTX Indus. v. United States, \n13  No. 20-00177 (Ct. Int’l Trade); appeal filed, No. 23-1891, ECF No. 5 (Fed. Cir. May 25, 2023) \n14  (identifying the 4,100 similar cases stayed pending resolution of the appeal).  Likewise, the Court of \n15  International Trade routinely exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i) to review agency \n16  determinations under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See, e.g., Sea Shepherd New Zealand v. United \n17  States, No. 20-00112 (Ct. Int’l Trade); Maui and Hector’s Dolphin Defenders NZ Inc. v. Nat’l Marine \n18  Fisheries Svc., No. 24-00218 (Ct. Int’l Trade).  This complaint should be treated no differently.   \n19  Because only the Court of International Trade has jurisdiction to hear this dispute regarding the \n20  imposition of tariffs, this Court lacks jurisdiction, so it is in the interests of justice to promptly transfer \n21  this action to the Court of International Trade.  28 U.S.C. § 1631. \n22     \n23 \n24 \n25 \n26 \n27 \n28 \n  DEFS.’ MOT.
