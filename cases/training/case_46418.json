    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration's Department of Energy (DOE) \"policy flash\" on April 11, 2025, which set a universal cap on indirect funding costs for institutions of higher education. Previously, the DOE dispersed funds based on both direct and indirect expenses already incurred by the institutions in the research process. Direct costs are those readily traceable to a specific project, while indirect costs are those that support multiple research projects. These indirect costs include facility and administration costs and are generally known as \"F&amp;A costs.\"&nbsp; Before the policy flash, research institutions had varying amounts of indirect cost reimbursement rates (expressed as a rate that is multiplied by the direct costs of a project) that could range as high as 60 percent for facility-intensive types of research. In the policy flash, the DOE set a 15 percent indirect cost rate for all grant awards to institutions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 14, 2025, the plaintiffs--multiple organizations and several public and private universities--filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Represented by private counsel, including former (Bush Administration) Solicitor General Paul Clement, the plaintiffs sued the DOE and its Secretary in his official capacity. The plaintiffs alleged that the DOE violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) by failing to act under 2 C.F.R. &sect; 200.414(c)(1), which states negotiated indirect cost rates \"must be accepted by all Federal Agencies.\" The complaint also alleged that the action violated the APA by unlawfully terminating existing grants and by illegally departing from cost recovery regulations. Finally, the plaintiffs alleged that the action was arbitrary and capricious, violated the DOE's authorizing statutes, and was in excess of DOE's statutory authority since it would operate retroactively.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs asked the court to vacate the policy, issue a declaratory judgment finding the policy invalid, issue a preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from enforcing the policy, award the plaintiffs attorneys' fees, and award any other equitable relief deemed proper by the court. On the same day as they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs also sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO).</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Allison D. Burroughs, who on April 16, 2025, granted a TRO that was to remain in effect until April 30. Judge Burroughs found that without the TRO, the plaintiffs would sustain immediate and irreparable injury before the court could hear from all the parties in the case. 2025 WL 1119791.</p>\r\n<p>On April 29, one day before the TRO was set to expire, Judge Burroughs extended the TRO to remain in effect until the court resolved the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. On May 15, the judge granted the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. The court found that it had jurisdiction since the plaintiffs' complaint primarily sounded in federal statutes rather than in contract. The court also found that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claims that the policy was arbitrary and capricious, conflicted with existing regulations, and was impermissibly retroactive. Given these findings, the court issued a universal preliminary injunction preventing the defendants from taking any further steps to implement the policy with regard to any grant recipients until the court issued a further order. 2025 WL 1414135.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 27, the defendants filed an unopposed motion to convert the preliminary injunction into a final judgment. The defendants submitted that there were no other facts or legal arguments for the court to review. While they disagreed with the court's decision, the defendants said that entering a final judgment would facilitate prompt and efficient review by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on their appeal. The court entered final judgment on June 30.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, the defendants filed a Notice of Appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.</p>\r\n<p>As of October 15, 2025, the appeal is ongoing, and the parties are currently briefing.&nbsp;</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about a new Department of Energy (DOE) rule made by the Trump Administration on April 11, 2025. The DOE created a policy called a \"policy flash\" that set a flat 15% limit on how much money colleges and universities could get back for indirect research costs. Indirect costs, also known as F&A (facilities and administration) costs, are expenses that help many research projects, like building upkeep and administration. Before this rule, schools could have much higher rates, depending on their type of research.\r\n\r\nOn April 14, 2025, several organizations and public and private universities sued the DOE in federal court in Massachusetts. They argued that the DOE rule broke government rules (called the Administrative Procedure Act) because it ignored already-negotiated rates and made cuts without proper legal steps. They said it was unfair, illegal, and would hurt ongoing research by cutting funding without warning.\r\n\r\nThe schools asked the court to stop the rule right away, and Judge Allison D. Burroughs agreed to place a temporary restraining order on the DOE policy until April 30, 2025, and later extended it. On May 15, the judge gave a preliminary order blocking DOE from enforcing the 15% cap until a final decision was made because the rule likely broke the law.\r\n\r\nDOE later asked for a final judgment so they could appeal. On June 30, 2025, the judge issued the final judgment. DOE appealed to a higher court, and, as of October 15, 2025, the case is still being argued on appeal.",

This suit challenges a flagrantly unlawful action by the Department of Energy \n(“DOE”)—slashing “indirect cost rates” for government-funded research—that is a virtual carbon \ncopy of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) policy that a district court has permanently \nenjoined, after  previously granting  a  prompt temporary restraining  order and  preliminary \ninjunction.  Massachusetts v. Nat’l Institutes of Health (“NIH”), No. 25-CV-10338, 2025 WL \n702163, at *1 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), judgment entered (D. Mass. Apr. 4, 2025), appeal filed (D. \nMass. Apr. 8, 2025).  DOE’s action is unlawful for most of the same reasons and, indeed, it is \nespecially egregious because DOE has not even attempted to address many of the flaws the district \ncourt found with NIH’s unlawful policy.  Here, as there, if DOE’s policy is allowed to stand, it \nwill devastate scientific research at America’s universities and badly undermine our Nation’s \nenviable status as a global leader in scientific research and innovation.   \n2.  For decades, universities have built their research institutions on the government’s \ncommitment to fund the costs of the research it supports.  Some of those costs are “direct;” that is, \nthey are readily attributable to specific projects.  Others are “indirect;” that is, they are necessary \nfor the research to occur but harder to attribute to individual projects.  Specialized nuclear-rated \nfacilities; computer systems to analyze enormous volumes of data; information-technology and \nutility systems providing the backbone for those efforts; and researchers and administrative staff \nwho keep the systems running—all are critical to cutting-edge research, but their costs typically \ncannot be allocated to any single project.  Because of caps on administrative costs, moreover, \nuniversities contribute a significant amount of their own funds to cover such costs, thereby \nsubsidizing the work funded by grants.  \n3.  Congress understood that agencies would “provide for payment of reimbursable \nindirect costs on the basis of predetermined fixed-percentage rates”  via a bespoke process \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 3 of 41\n \naccounting for each institution’s unique cost structures and grants.  41 U.S.C. § 4708.  That is why \nCongress gave the Executive Branch the quintessentially administrative task of identifying \ninstitution-specific metrics and did not itself set across-the-board metrics.  Hence, the Office of \nManagement and Budget (“OMB”) exercised its authority to promulgate regulations requiring \nagencies to negotiate indirect cost rates with individual financial assistance recipients through a \ncarefully regulated process, based on each institution’s unique needs and cost structure.  See 31 \nU.S.C.  §  503(a),  (b)(2)(C)  (empowering  OMB  to  “establish  governmentwide  financial \nmanagement policies for executive agencies,” including as to “grant[s]”).  For universities, the \nindirect cost rates are typically negotiated by either “the Department of Health and Human Services \n(HHS) or the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on \nwhich of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provide[d] more funds directly to the [relevant] \neducational institution for the most recent three years.” 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. III(C)(11)(a)(1).  By \nregulation, this negotiation yields a rate that is intended to reflect the actual, verified indirect costs \nincurred by the institution.  Then, “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal \nagencies,” unless one of the narrow exceptions applies.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).   \n4.  The purpose of this process is to ensure that the negotiated rate correctly captures \nthe actual indirect costs incurred in the conduct of research.  Differences in indirect cost rates do \nnot reflect undeserved government subsidies; rather, institutions have different indirect cost rates \nbecause they engage in different types of research and have unique mixes of fixed and variable \ninstitutional costs that are appropriately allocated across multiple research projects or other cost \nobjectives.  Government funding agencies may deviate from the negotiated rates only in limited \ncircumstances, and only via procedures that provide ample notice and protections to ensure that \nthe basic terms of engagement are not changed precipitously.  The regulatory framework thus \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 4 of 41\n \nrecognizes that there is no one-size-fits-all approach and that participating institutions have \nprofound reliance interests in the negotiated rates—rates that are tailored to their circumstances \nand that facilitate the work that makes the United States a world leader in cutting-edge research.  \n5.  This is not the first time an administration has considered limiting indirect cost rates \nand superimposing a one-size-fits-all regime on what has long been a tailored, negotiated process.  \nIn 2017, the Administration proposed slashing the indirect cost rate to 10% for all NIH grants.  The \nreaction  in  Congress  was  swift  and  bipartisan.    Congress  identified  serious  problems \nimmediately—observing that the proposal would “radically change the nature of the Federal \nGovernment’s relationship with the research community” by altering a methodology for indirect \nrates that “has been in place since 1965,” emphasizing that Congress had “not seen any details of \nthe proposal that might explain how it could be accomplished without throwing research programs \nacross the country into disarray,” S. Rep. No. 115-150, at 109 (2017), and concluding that this \nproposal was “misguided and would have a devastating impact on biomedical research across the \ncountry,” H.R. Rep. No. 115-244, at 50 (2017).   \n6.  In February 2025, the Administration nonetheless tried the same maneuver again, \nand NIH issued a notice stating that it was “imposing a standard indirect cost rate on all grants of \n15%.”  NIH, Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost \nRates, NOT-OD-25-068 (Feb. 7, 2025), https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-OD-\n25-068.html.  A federal district court quickly enjoined that policy, finding that the Administration \nhad not only flouted an appropriations rider that Congress had enacted in the wake of the 2017 \nNIH episode, but also had violated the government-wide regulations governing indirect cost rates \nand the reasoned decisionmaking requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  \nNIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *1. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 5 of 41\n \n7.  Now the Administration has brought a similar policy to DOE, issuing late on April \n11, 2025 a new policy stating that “hereinafter, the Department will no longer use the negotiated \nindirect cost rate” for universities; “setting a standardized 15 percent indirect cost rate for all grant \nawards to” universities; and announcing that DOE “is undertaking action to terminate all grant \nawards to [universities] that do not conform with this updated policy.”  DOE, Policy Flash: \nAdjusting Department of Energy Grant Policy for Institutions of Higher Education (IHE) (Apr. \n11, 2025) (attached as Ex. A) (“Rate Cap Policy”).  The announcement acknowledges that “many \ngrant recipients use indirect cost payments to effectuate research funded by the Department’s grant \nawards,” but then states without explanation that a categorical limit on indirect cost rates of 15% \nis necessary to ensure DOE “is putting [funds] to appropriate use” and to “improve efficiency and \ncurtail costs where appropriate.”  The Rate Cap Policy applies this supposedly necessary limit on \nindirect cost rates “only with respect to” universities, not to other recipients of DOE grants. \n8.  As with the NIH’s similar maneuver, DOE’s Rate Cap Policy is unlawful, and \nobviously so.  It violates the indirect-cost regulations that OMB promulgated precisely to provide \nneeded stability, protect reliance interests, and ensure that recipients can cover the actual costs of \nconducting the research that the government has selected them to undertake.  Those regulations \nprovide, in no uncertain terms, that the “[n]egotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all \nFederal agencies.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).  DOE’s reading of the narrow exceptions from that \nmandate would render that command meaningless and effectively replace the word “must” with \n“may,” allowing any agency to toss those negotiated rates simply by announcing a different across-\nthe-board policy.  Nothing in the regulations’ text remotely supports that bizarre reading.  Indeed, \nthe Rate Cap Policy separately violates the regulations’ requirement that any departure from the \nnegotiated rate appear upfront in the notice of funding opportunity—a requirement that DOE \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 6 of 41\n \ncannot evade by purporting to cancel the grants of recipients that decline to agree to its unlawful \n15% rates.  \n9.  The Rate Cap Policy also defies the APA’s reasoned-decisionmaking requirements.  \nAlthough the Rate Cap Policy strings together a few sentences describing its change, absent is any \ngenuine attempt at an explanation—one that would “examine[] ‘the relevant data’ and articulate[] \n‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [the] decision, ‘including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made.’”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 773 (2019) (quoting \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. \n29, 43 (1983)).  The Rate Cap Policy ignores that indirect costs are necessary for critical research \nto proceed and are distinguished from direct costs only in that they are not attributable to just one \ngrant.  The Policy ignores the devastating consequences of jettisoning an approach dating back to \n1965—consequences that Congress itself emphasized the only other time something like this was \nproposed.  It ignores how its across-the-board policy thwarts the very goal that DOE purports to \npursue: “continuing to expand American innovation and scientific research.”  It ignores, as well, \nthe reliance interests of the universities receiving federal funding—reliance interests that DOE \ncasually destroys.  Cf. FCC v. Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (if a “new policy \nrests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay its prior policy; or when its prior \npolicy has engendered serious reliance interests” an agency’s failure to consider such factors \n“would be arbitrary or capricious”).  The Policy likewise ignores the guidance this Court provided \nin striking down the NIH’s virtually identical effort.  Finally, the Rate Change Policy inexplicably \nimposes its new requirement only on universities, not other DOE grant recipients.  If this approach \nwere a sound policy necessary to protect the public fisc (it is not), DOE would have applied it more \nbroadly—or at least explained why it targeted only universities.  The contours of DOE’s decision \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 7 of 41\n \nthus “cannot be adequately explained in terms of’ the explanation it provided.”   Dep’t of \nCommerce, 588 U.S. at 784.   \n10.  The effects, moreover, will be immediate and devastating.  The Rate Cap Policy \nstates unequivocally that “the Department is undertaking action to terminate all grant awards to \nIHEs that do not conform with this updated policy” (emphasis added).  That is, DOE is poised to \nput recipients to a choice: Either accept reductions in indirect cost rates, or face terminations.  \nAnd as soon as recipients face that choice, the harm will be immediate and irreparable.  Because \nuniversities cannot sustain DOE-funded programs at the 15% indirect cost rate that DOE will \nnow inflict, myriad critical projects—often the product of years or decades of effort—are in \njeopardy of being stopped in their tracks.  These include the development of advanced nuclear \nand cybersecurity technologies, arms control verification mechanisms designed to reduce the risk \nof nuclear war, novel radioactive drugs to diagnose and treat cancer, and upgrades for the \nelectrical grids that keep the lights on in rural communities, among many others.  Meanwhile, the \nhuman cost will be immense, as universities will have to immediately reduce staff and training \nprograms—irreversibly damaging their academic communities, the careers of these young \nresearchers, and the national interest in training the next generation of scientists.  Nor can the \nconsequences of grinding vital scientific work to a halt, and stifling training, be unwound.  The \npace of scientific discoveries in the national interest will be slowed.  Progress on a safe and \neffective nuclear deterrent, novel energy sources, and cures for debilitating and life-threatening \nillness will be obstructed.  America’s rivals will celebrate, even as science and industry in the \nUnited States suffer.  \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 8 of 41\n \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n11.  This action arises under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701-706, and regulations governing federal grants.  This Court has subject matter jurisdiction \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA.  \n12.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), because Defendants \nare agencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting in their official capacity, \nand a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District, \nand a Plaintiff resides in this district.   \nPARTIES \n13.  Plaintiff  Association of  American  Universities  (“AAU”)  is  an  association \ncomposed of 71 leading research universities with the goal of transforming lives through \neducation, research, and innovation.   AAU’s member organizations are public and private \nresearch universities that are world-renowned centers of scientific and technological research and \ninnovation.  Much of their scientific work is supported by DOE grants.   \n14.  Plaintiff Association of Public  and Land-Grant Universities (“APLU”)  is  a \nmembership organization that fosters a community of university leaders collectively working to \nadvance the mission of public research universities.  A core mission of the APLU is fostering \nresearch and innovation, specifically by “promoting pathbreaking scientific research.”1 The \nassociation’s membership consists of over 200 research universities, land-grant institutions, and \naffiliated organizations across the United States.  Much of their scientific work is supported by \nDOE grants.   \n \n1 Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities, About Us, https://www.aplu.org/about-us/.  \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 9 of 41\n \n15.  Plaintiff American Council on Education (“ACE”) is a nonprofit association \ncomposed of more than 1,600 colleges, universities, and higher education-related associations, \norganizations, and corporations with the goal of enabling higher education institutions to flourish.  \nACE’s member organizations are accredited, degree-granting colleges and universities, as well \nas related associations, organizations, and corporations that also serve as world-renowned centers \nof scientific technological research and innovation.  Much of their scientific work is supported \nby DOE grants.   \n16.  Plaintiff  Brown  University  (“Brown”)  is  a  private  university  located  in \nProvidence, Rhode Island.  Brown conducts fundamental and applied research directed at the \nforefront of DOE priorities, including research critical to the nation’s current and future energy \nneeds and security.  DOE’s planned cap of 15% for indirect cost expenditures would result in an \nover two-million-dollar loss annually to Brown’s planned research budget.  \n17.  Plaintiff California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”) is a private university \nlocated in Pasadena, California.  Caltech is a world-class science and engineering institute that \nhas long been at the vanguard of technological innovation.  Caltech receives substantial annual \nfunding from DOE and currently has 83 active DOE awards and subawards.  In fiscal year 2024, \nCaltech expended more than $25 million in conducting research supported by DOE, with almost \n$8 million expended as indirect costs.  If the indirect cost rate is reduced to 15% of modified total \ndirect costs, that would reduce the Caltech’s annual indirect cost recovery by nearly $6 million.  \n18.  Plaintiff Cornell University (“Cornell”) is a private university located in Ithaca, \nNew York.  Cornell is a leading research institution that has been selected by the federal \ngovernment to conduct a wide variety of vital forms of research on behalf of United States \ncitizens, funded in part by agency awards, cooperative agreements, and contracts from across the \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 10 of 41\n \nfederal government, including DOE.  In fiscal year 2024, Cornell expended approximately $30 \nmillion on more than 110 awards from DOE.  Cornell’s indirect cost rate, as negotiated with the \nfederal government, allowed Cornell to recover approximately $8.5 million in reimbursement for \nthose costs from DOE.  Cornell’s ability to conduct DOE-sponsored research during fiscal year \n2025 would be significantly impaired by the reduction in the indirect cost reimbursement, \nestimated as a shortfall of roughly $8 million in a typical fiscal year.  \n19.  Plaintiff Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois (“Illinois”) is a public \nuniversity with its flagship campus in Urbana-Champaign, Illinois.  Illinois is a leading land-\ngrant research university and one of the largest recipients of DOE funding, having received over \n$122 million in fiscal year 2024.  Since Illinois’s negotiated indirect cost rate is 58.6%, Illinois \nwould lose substantial dollars if its predetermined indirect cost rate were reduced to 15%.    \n20.  Plaintiff Massachusetts Institute of Technology (“MIT”) is a private university \nlocated in Cambridge, Massachusetts.  Founded to accelerate the nation’s industrial revolution, \nMIT faculty, researchers, and graduates have invented fundamental technologies, launched new \nindustries, and advanced human understanding of science, technology, and other areas of \nscholarship.  MIT received $93 million from the DOE in MIT’s fiscal year 2024 for performing \nsponsored research.  MIT conducts research under 286 direct and indirect funding awards from \nDOE that are currently active for its fiscal year 2025.  If DOE reduces the indirect costs rate to \n15%, then MIT forecasts it will lose approximately $15 million to $16 million in reimbursement \nfor costs that support DOE research over the next 12 months alone.  \n21.  Plaintiff Regents of the University of Michigan (“Michigan”) is a public university \nlocated in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  It receives substantial annual funding from DOE, which \nsupports critical and cutting-edge research, including Michigan’s nuclear research program, \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 11 of 41\n \nadvanced battery technologies, and next-generation engine and fuel technologies.  Of the $81.8 \nmillion in DOE funding that the University received in fiscal year 2024, approximately $56.1 \nmillion was allocated for direct costs and $25.7 million for indirect costs.  Similarly, in fiscal year \n2025, the University expects to receive $61.8 million in DOE funding for direct costs, while $28.3 \nmillion is allocated for indirect costs.  And over the next five years, the University anticipates \nreceiving an average of $75.8 million from the DOE for annual direct costs.  Based on the \npredetermined indirect cost rate of 56%, which was agreed upon by the federal government as of \nJuly 1, 2024, the University thus expects to receive approximately $42.4 million in indirect cost \nrecovery on an annual basis.  If—contrary to what the University of Michigan has negotiated with \nthe federal government—the indirect cost rate is  reduced to  15%, that would reduce the \nUniversity’s anticipated annual indirect cost recovery by $31.1 million, to $11.4 million.   \n22.  Plaintiff Board of Trustees of Michigan State University (“MSU”) is a public \nuniversity located in East Lansing, Michigan.  MSU was the first land-grant university established \nunder the Morrill Act and today is a leading global public research university.  Of the $161 million \nin DOE funding that MSU received for fiscal year 2024, approximately $116 million was for \ndirect costs and about $45 million was for indirect costs reimbursements.   Based on the \npredetermined indirect cost rate of 57%, which was agreed upon by the federal government, MSU \nexpects to receive approximately $45 million in indirect cost recovery on an annual basis from \nDOE.  If the indirect cost rate is reduced to 15%, that would reduce MSU’s anticipated annual \nindirect cost recovery by approximately $32 million.   \n23.  Plaintiff Trustees of Princeton University (“Princeton”) is a private university \nlocated in Princeton, New Jersey.  Princeton is a world-class research institution that aims to unite \npeople, resources, and opportunities for the creation, preservation, and transmission of knowledge \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 12 of 41\n \nfor the benefit of the nation and humanity.  Princeton has 112 DOE awards and subawards and \nintends to apply for additional research funding this year.  In fiscal year 2024, Princeton expended \napproximately $32.6 million in conducting such research supported by DOE.  Of this total, \napproximately $10 million were expended as indirect costs to support needs such as the \ninfrastructure, research administration, compliance, and security expenses required to conduct \nthe funded research.  Princeton’s negotiated on-campus indirect cost rate for fiscal year 2024 is \n62%.  Princeton would therefore lose substantial dollars if Princeton’s predetermined indirect \ncost rate were reduced to 15%. \n24.  Plaintiff University of Rochester (“Rochester”) is a private university located in \nRochester, New York. Rochester conducts groundbreaking research in a wide variety of fields, \nincluding fusion energy, quantum computer, and theoretical and experimental elementary particle \nphysics.  The University’s Laboratory for Laser Energetics (“LLE”) is the nation’s leading \nuniversity-based research center in fusion, laser science and technology, and high-energy-density \nscience research, and operates two of the largest and most-capable government-owned lasers at \nany academic institution in the world.  Rochester’s negotiated indirect cost rate through fiscal \nyear 2026-2027 is 51%.  DOE’s planned cap of 15% for indirect cost expenditures would result \nin an indirect cost recovery loss to Rochester of greater than $25 million.   \n25.  Defendant Department of Energy (“DOE”) is an executive department of the \nfederal government that is responsible for coordinating national energy policy and supporting \nenergy research and development to advance American energy, economic, and national security. \n26.  Defendant Chris Wright is Secretary of DOE.  He is sued in his official capacity. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 13 of 41\n \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA. Indirect Cost System Structure \n27.  For decades, DOE-funded research at universities has made the United States a \nworld leader in  science.   The federal government awards billions of dollars to  research \nuniversities that can most effectively further DOE’s goals.  In fiscal year 2023, DOE awarded \nmore than $2.6 billion to nearly 400 different universities.   \n28.  DOE grants have funded scientific research that has led to innumerable scientific \nbreakthroughs, including the discovery of the Higgs  particle.   Dozens of DOE-supported \nscientists have earned Nobel Prizes for their groundbreaking scientific work.2 \n29.  Most DOE-funded research occurs at outside institutions, including universities.  \nThis approach allows DOE to fund a wide array of institutions, promote competition for research \ngrants, and facilitate the training of the next generation of researchers. \n30.  DOE pursues its research goals by funding the critical scientific research of the \norganizational Plaintiffs’ member universities and the university Plaintiffs.  At any given time, \nindividual research universities often depend on myriad of DOE grants that support independent \nresearch projects across multiple university departments and centers.  \n31.  These DOE grants  are issued pursuant to  a well-established legislative and \nregulatory framework.  Congress has authorized DOE to provide for grants under various statutes, \nand it has directed agencies to use indirect cost rates.  See 41 U.S.C. § 4708.  Congress also \ninstructed OMB to issue general guidance on fiscal administration issues.  See 31 U.S.C. § 503(a), \n(b)(2)(C) (empowering OMB to “establish governmentwide financial management policies for \nexecutive agencies,” including as to “grant[s]”).  In turn, OMB has established uniform guidance \n \n2 DOE, DOE Nobel Laureates, https://science.osti.gov/About/Honors-and-Awards/DOE-Nobel-Laureates (last \nvisited Apr. 14, 2025). \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 14 of 41\n \nfor agencies to administer grants under the agencies’ purview.  See 2 C.F.R. pt. 200 (setting forth \n“Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal \nAwards”).  DOE has expressly adopted OMB’s guidance into its own regulations.  See 2 C.F.R. \n§ 910.120 (adopting OMB guidance in 2 C.F.R. pt. 200). \n32.  As provided by regulation, DOE’s competitive grantmaking process begins with \na notice of funding opportunities for a specific topic followed by new application submissions.  \nSee 2 C.F.R. § 200.204. \n33.  After a formal review process that includes peer review, the DOE issues a legally \nbinding Notice of Award (“NOA”) to selected grant recipients stating that funds may be requested \n(i.e., drawn down) from the agency.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(b)(7) (establishing that the award \nmust include the “[a]mount of [f]ederal [f]unds [o]bligated by this action”).  An NOA is issued \nfor the initial budget period and each subsequent budget period, and it reflects any future-year \nunderstandings about the continuation of the funded project.  See 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(c)(1)(iv). \n34.  Federal grant recipients generally do not receive lump-sum grants.  Instead, they \nuse cost-based accounting systems under which they first incur expenses and then recover their \nactual, documented costs for conducting research. \n35.  The costs of conducting DOE-funded research come in two types.  The first is \n“direct costs”—costs that can be attributed to a specific research project.  For example, the salary \nof a graduate student assigned to a particular research project, or the cost of a specialized piece \nof equipment purchased for a research project is a direct cost. \n36.  The second is “indirect costs”—costs that are necessary for research but that \nsupport multiple research projects.  These costs have long been reimbursed as part of federal \ngrant funding: in 1962, Congress authorized the use of “predetermined fixed-percentage rates” \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 15 of 41\n \nfor “payment of reimbursable indirect costs” attributable to research agreements with educational \ninstitutions.  Act of Sept. 5, 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-638, 76 Stat. 437, codified at 41 U.S.C. § 4708. \n37.  “[I]ndirect costs” are comprised of “[f]acilities” and “[a]dministration” costs.  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414(a).   The “[f]acilities” category is “defined as depreciation on buildings, \nequipment and  capital  improvements, interest  on  debt  associated with  certain  buildings, \nequipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses.”  Id. This \ncategory includes the costs of the physical infrastructure necessary for carrying out research, such \nas construction and maintenance of buildings, including specialized facilities and laboratories.  \nThose costs are indirect because a single building, such as a state-of-the-art nuclear facility, might \nhouse numerous research groups engaged in multiple distinct projects.   \n38.  The “[a]dministration” category is defined as “general administration and general \nexpenses such as the director’s office, accounting, personnel, and all other types of expenditures \nnot listed specifically under one of the subcategories of ‘Facilities.”’  Id.  This category includes \ncosts related to the administrative and compliance activities required to conduct federally \nsponsored research, such as information technology professionals, experts on safety and security, \ntechnical staff, and many others.  These are indirect costs because a single employee or group of \nemployees will handle these necessary administrative activities across multiple DOE grants.  \nBecause of caps on administrative costs, moreover, universities contribute a significant amount \nof their own funds to cover such costs, thereby subsidizing the work funded by grants.  \n39.  Federal regulations require research institutions to express their indirect costs as a \nrate that is multiplied by the overhead-bearing direct costs of each individual research grant \nassociated with those costs.  See Appendix III to Part 200—Indirect (F & A) Costs Identification \nand Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs).  This \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 16 of 41\n \nmethodology ensures that indirect costs are allocated fairly across supported projects, with the \nmore expensive and resource-intensive research projects being allocated a larger share of indirect \ncosts.  As a simplified example, suppose a single laboratory houses two research projects—one \nwith $75,000 of annual overhead-bearing direct costs and one with $25,000 of annual overhead-\nbearing direct costs.  Suppose, too, that the laboratory’s sole indirect cost is the cost of electricity, \nwhich costs $10,000 per year.  Because the cost of electricity ($10,000) is 10% of the overhead-\nbearing direct costs ($100,000), the indirect cost rate would be 10%.  Thus, $7,500 of electricity \ncosts would be allocated to the first project, and $2,500 of electricity costs would be allocated to \nthe second project.   \n40.  Federal regulations prescribe a detailed methodology for negotiating indirect cost \nrates.  See Appendix III to Part 200.  Typically, a single agency negotiates an indirect cost rate \nwith an institution.  For universities, rates are generally negotiated by either “the Department of \nHealth and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense’s Office of Naval Research \n(DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies (HHS or DOD) provide[d] more funds \nto the [relevant] educational institution for the most recent three years.” 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. \nIII(C)(11)(a)(1). \n41.  That indirect cost rate then applies to all of that institution’s grants across the entire \nfederal government.  Federal regulations require institutions to conduct and submit to their federal \nagency comprehensive cost analyses that follow detailed federal cost accounting guidelines \ngoverning reasonable and allowable indirect costs.  For example, if an institution seeks to recover \nthe  cost of building  maintenance, it  must  document those costs  and then allocate those \nmaintenance costs across research and non-research programs. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 17 of 41\n \n42.  The federal agency then reviews and verifies these proposals and determines the \ninstitution’s indirect cost rate.  Again, this rate reflects actual, verified costs incurred by the \ninstitution.   \n43.  Once the federal agency agrees to an indirect cost rate, it binds the entire federal \ngovernment during the period that the negotiated rate is in effect.  Typically, the negotiated rates \nremain in effect for one year, although in some cases they remain in effect for up to four years.  \n44.  After the costs are incurred, federal agencies conduct audits to ensure that the \nnegotiated indirect cost rate conforms to the actual indirect costs that were incurred.  The indirect \ncost rate can be adjusted if the audit establishes that the institution has recovered excess costs. \n45.  DOE is required to use that negotiated indirect cost rate unless a deviation \ntherefrom “for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award” is “required by Federal \nstatute or regulation” or is “approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with [2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3)].”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1). \n46.  The cross-referenced provision, 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3), in turn makes clear that \nthe negotiated rates remain the baseline and that it authorizes only specific “deviations” for \nindividual awards or classes of awards when specified criteria are met.  In particular, that \nprovision specifies that “[t]he Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the \npolicies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek \nand justify deviations from negotiated rates.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3). \n47.  The  policies,  procedures,  and  general  decision-making  criteria  justifying \ndeviations apply prospectively.  Pursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(4), “[t]he Federal agency must \ninclude, in  the  notice  of funding opportunity, the  policies relating  to  indirect  cost  rate \nreimbursement or cost share as approved.”  Moreover, “the Federal agency should incorporate \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 18 of 41\n \ndiscussion of these policies into its outreach activities with applicants before posting a notice of \nfunding opportunity.”  Id. \n48.  Negotiated rates vary significantly from institution to institution.  The primary \nreason for this variation is that different institutions conduct different types of research.  Scientific \nlaboratories tend to be far more expensive to build and maintain than generic office buildings.  \nAs such, an institution engaging in cutting-edge nuclear will likely have a higher indirect cost \nrate than an institution primarily engaged in social science research.  Even in the context of \nscientific research, some types of research are more expensive than others.  If a particular \ninstitution invests in an expensive piece of advanced lab equipment that supports multiple lines \nof research, that institution will have higher indirect cost rates than a different institution that \ndoes not use expensive lab equipment or uses such equipment for only one research project.   \n49.  Institutions with higher-than-average negotiated indirect cost rates are typically \nthose that support facility-intensive types of research.  State of the art nuclear and energy \nresearch, for example, often requires higher indirect cost rates. \n50.  Past studies show that indirect cost rates for university research are slightly less \nthan those for other research performers, i.e., that universities had the lowest percentage of total \nresearch costs classified as indirect costs as compared to federal laboratories and industrial \nlaboratories.3  \n \n3 Association of American Universities, Frequently Asked Questions About Facilities And Administrative (F&A) \nCosts of Federally Sponsored University Research (Feb. 10, 2025), https://www.aau.edu/key-issues/frequently-\nasked-questions-about-facilities-and-administrative-costs.  \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 19 of 41\n \nB.  Prior Attempts to Limit Indirect Cost Rates. \n51.  In 2017, the Administration released a budget proposal that would have slashed \nthe indirect cost rate for NIH grants to 10%.  See Office of Management & Budget, Major Savings \nand Reforms: Budget of the U.S. Government Fiscal Year 2018, at 43 (2017). \n52.  The proposal spurred widespread criticism and alarm.  The House Subcommittee \non Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on Appropriations held \na two-hour long hearing discussing concerns, on a bipartisan basis, relating to the proposed cap \non indirect costs.  Hearing on the Role of Facilities and Administrative Costs in Supporting NIH-\nFunded Research Before the Subcomm. on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and \nRelated Agencies of the  H.  Comm. On  Appropriations, 115th Con. (2017), available at: \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3Eb7CjsjRE. \n53.  Congress then enacted, on a bipartisan basis, an appropriations rider providing \nthat regulatory “provisions relating to indirect costs . . . including with respect to the approval of \ndeviations from negotiated rates, shall continue to apply to the National Institutes of Health to \nthe same extent and in the same manner as such provisions were applied in the third quarter of \nfiscal year 2017.”  Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, § 226, 132 Stat. \n348, 740.  The appropriations rider also prohibits spending appropriated funds “to develop or \nimplement a modified approach to” the reimbursement of “indirect costs” and “deviations from \nnegotiated rates,” or to “intentionally or substantially expand the fiscal effect of the approval of \nsuch deviations from negotiated rates beyond the proportional effect of such approvals in such \nquarter.”  Id. \n54.  Both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees specifically addressed the \nneed for the rider in direct response to the Administration’s proposal in their respective reports.  \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 20 of 41\n \nThe House Report noted that, “[w]hile the Committee appreciates the Secretary’s efforts to find \nefficiencies in NIH research spending, the Administration’s proposal to dramatically reduce and \ncap reimbursement of facilities and administrative (F&A)  costs to research institutions is \nmisguided and would have a devastating impact on biomedical research across the country.”  H.R. \nRep. No. 115-244, at 50 (2017).  The Senate Report noted, “[t]he methodology for negotiating \nindirect costs has been in place since 1965, and rates have remained largely stable across NIH \ngrantees for decades.  The Administration’s proposal would radically change the nature of the \nFederal Government’s relationship with the research community, abandoning the Government’s \nlong-established responsibility for underwriting much of the Nation’s research infrastructure, and \njeopardizing biomedical research nationwide.  The Committee has not seen any details of the \nproposal that might explain how it could be accomplished without throwing research programs \nacross the country into disarray.”  S. Rep. No. 115-150, at 109 (2017). \n55.  Congress not only adopted the rider in 2017; it has repeatedly reenacted the rider \never since.  See Department of Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, 2019, Pub. L. \nNo. 115-245, § 224, 132 Stat. 2981, 3094; Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, Pub. \nL. No. 116-94, § 224, 133 Stat. 2534, 2582; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, Pub. L. No. \n116-260, § 224, 134 Stat. 1182, 1594; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022, Pub. L. No. 117-\n103, § 224, 136 Stat. 49, 470-71; Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, Pub. L. No. 117-328, \n§ 224, 136 Stat. 4459, 4883-84.  And this rider remains in effect to this day, in the now-operative \nstatute.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. L. No. 118-47, div. D, tit. II, \n§ 224, 138 Stat. 460, 677. \n56.  The appropriations riders were co-extensive with the proposed rate cap.   To \nPlaintiffs’ knowledge, no Administration has proposed a budget that would cap the indirect cost \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 21 of 41\n \nrate for DOE grants at a fixed percentage, like 10 or 15%.  Congress therefore has yet to adopt \nan analogous appropriations rider for DOE grants. \n57.  In light  of both the applicable regulations and the rider, the negotiated NIH \nindirect cost rates remained undisturbed until late on Friday, February 7, 2025, when NIH issued \na Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates (“NIH \nRate Change Notice”).  NIH purported to slash and cap previously negotiated indirect cost rates \non all existing and future grant awards for biomedical research, with an effective date of February \n10, 2025.   \n58.  Given the dire consequences of the NIH Rate Change Notice, which would have \ndramatically disrupted the development of innovative medical research and treatment, three sets \nof plaintiffs—a group of 22 states, a group of five medical associations, and a group of 17 \nassociations and universities, including many of the plaintiffs in this case—filed complaints and \nmotions for temporary restraining orders.  All three plaintiff groups argued that the NIH Rate \nChange Notice was unlawful under the APA. \n59.  The Court found that the serious consequences of the NIH Rate Change Notice \nwarranted issuance of a nationwide temporary restraining order to maintain the status quo until \nthe matter could be fully addressed by the Court.  Following briefing, on March 5, 2025, the \nCourt issued a nationwide preliminary injunction.  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *1.  After finding \njurisdiction appropriate because the parties sought to vindicate rights rooted in federal statutes \nand regulations and sought relief that was injunctive in nature, the Court found the plaintiffs likely \nto succeed on the merits.  See id. at *4–8.  First, the Court found that the NIH Rate Change Notice \nviolated  applicable regulations,  which  barred deviation  from negotiated  rates  without  a \ndocumented justification, and more generally barred wholesale deviation from negotiated rates \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 22 of 41\n \nin the fashion attempted by NIH.  See id. at *10–11.  The Court also found that plaintiffs were \nlikely to succeed on their statutory claims that the NIH Rate Change Notice violated the \nappropriations rider and the APA.  See id. at *11–16.  In particular, the Court found that the NIH \nRate Change Notice was arbitrary and capricious because the explanations provided for the rate \nchange were “conclusory” and its “proffered ‘reasons’ fail[ed] to grapple with the relevant factors \nor pertinent aspects of the problem.” Id. at *17–18.  Furthermore, it found that the NIH Rate \nChange Notice failed to “recognize or consider the substantial reliance interests at issue.” Id. at \n*19; see id. at *20 (“The Notice fails to contemplate the budgets of these institutions, formulated \nmonths and years before this Notice’s sudden implementation. It fails to contemplate the risk to \nhuman life as research and clinical trials are suspended in response to the shortfall.  It fails to \ncontemplate the  life,  careers,  and  advancement that  will  be  lost  as  these  budgets  are \nindiscriminately slashed.”).  The Court also found the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their \nclaims that NIH failed to follow notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures and enacted a policy \nthat was impermissibly retroactive as to existing grants.  See id. at *22–27.  The Court then found \nthat that the plaintiffs demonstrated irreparable harm and that the balance of the equities and \npublic interest favored an injunction.  See id. at *27–32.  The Court enjoined the NIH Rate Change \nNotice on a nationwide basis.  See id. at *35.  The parties then jointly moved to convert the \npreliminary injunction to a permanent injunction.  See NIH, No. 25-CV-10338 (D. Mass. Apr. 4, \n2025), ECF No. 96.  The government has not filed a motion to stay the injunction pending an \nappeal. \nC. DOE’s Rate Cap Policy \n60.  On Friday, April 11, 2025, the DOE issued the Rate Cap Policy, titled “Adjusting \nDepartment of Energy Grant Policy for Institutions of Higher Education (IHE).”  The Rate Cap \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 23 of 41\n \nPolicy announces that the “hereinafter, the Department will no longer use the negotiated indirect \ncost rate for grants awarded to IHEs. Instead, it is setting a standardized 15 percent indirect cost \nrate for all grant awards to IHEs.” The Rate Cap Policy provides that “[a]ll future Department \ngrant awards to IHEs will default to this 15 percent indirect cost rate.” The Rate Cap Policy \nfurther announces that, “[c]onsistent with [the Rate Cap Policy], the Department is undertaking \naction to terminate all grant awards to IHEs that do not conform with this updated policy” (citing \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a), (b)).  \n61.  The Rate Cap Policy justifies this sweeping change by stating that “[t]his system \nwill better balance the Department’s twin aims of funding meaningful research and upholding its \nfiduciary duties to the American people.”  It also states the following as putative justification: \n“To improve efficiency and curtail costs where appropriate, the Department seeks to better \nbalance the financial needs of grant recipients with the Department’s obligation to responsibly \nmanage federal funds.”  It further states that indirect costs payments are “not for the Department’s \ndirect research funding” (citing 89 Fed. Reg. 30046-30093), while acknowledging that “many \ngrant recipients use indirect cost payments to effectuate research funded by the Department’s \ngrant awards.” \n62.   The Rate Cap Policy purports to rely on the authority of 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) \nfor its setting of a single, uniform indirect cost rate of 15 percent for all institutions of higher \neducation.  But that provision authorizes deviations from the negotiated indirect cost rates only \nfor “either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award” and “only when required by \nFederal statute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance \nwith [2 C.F.R. § 414(c)(3)].”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) (emphasis added).  It does not authorize \nDOE to entirely eliminate the negotiated rate for all federal awards for institutions of higher \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 24 of 41\n \neducation.   Moreover, to deviate from a negotiated rate—absent a statutory or regulatory \nrequirement to do so—DOE must comply with the requirement that the agency “implement, and \nmake publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their \nprograms  will  follow  to  seek  and  justify  deviations  from  negotiated  rates.”  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.414(c)(3).  In addition, pursuant to the regulatory provision that immediately follows, DOE \n“must include” such “policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement” “in the notice of \nfunding opportunity.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(4).  \n63.  The Rate Cap Policy is final agency action under the APA.  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  \nThe Rate Cap Policy (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” \nand (2) is action “by which rights or obligations have been determined, or from which legal \nconsequences will flow.”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 (1997) (internal quotation marks \nomitted).  In particular, the Rate Cap Policy marks the consummation of DOE’s decision-making \nprocess because it announces DOE’s decision to immediately impose a 15% across-the-board \nindirect cost rate to institutions of higher education and to terminate grants that use a different \nrate.  And the Rate Cap Policy is an action by which rights or obligations have been determined \nor from which legal consequences will flow because it purports to limit the percent of indirect \ncosts for which a grant recipient can be reimbursed under the grant. \nD. Plaintiffs’ Prior Indirect Cost Funding and Plaintiffs’ Injuries \n64.  Plaintiffs are attaching as exhibits to this Complaint declarations describing \nuniversities’ DOE grants and the harms they face, which Plaintiffs incorporate here by reference. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 25 of 41\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Illegal Departure from Negotiated Cost Rates in Violation of 2 C.F.R. 200.414) \n \n65.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n66.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n67.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) states that negotiated indirect cost rates “must be \naccepted by all Federal agencies.  A Federal agency may use a rate different from the negotiated \nrate for either a class of Federal awards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal \nstatute or regulation, or when approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with \nparagraph (c)(3) of this section.”   \n68.  In turn, 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3) states: “The Federal agency must implement, and \nmake publicly available, the policies, procedures and general decision-making criteria that their \nprograms will follow to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.”   \n69.  By  pronouncing a  single,  uniform “policy”  setting  indirect  cost  rates  for \nuniversities at 15% regardless of the otherwise applicable negotiated rate, DOE violated 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.414(c)(1) and (c)(3).     \n70.  These  provisions  authorize  agencies  to  announce  procedures  governing \nsubsequent decisions to make individualized deviations from the baseline negotiated rate.  They \ndo not authorize DOE to make a unilateral decision to wipe out all negotiated rates for all \nuniversities.  The plain text of 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3) requires agencies to enact three different \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 26 of 41\n \nthings—“policies, procedures, and general decision-making criteria,” and then requires  agencies \nto “follow” these tripartite requirements “to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rights.”   \n71.  Here, while the Rate Cap Policy states that it  “sets forth [DOE’s] policies, \nprocedures, and  general  decision-making  criteria,”  the  Rate  Cap  Policy  establishes  no \n“procedures.”   A “procedure” is  a “series of steps followed in a  regular definite order.”  \nProcedure, M-W.com,  https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/procedure (last  visited \nApr. 14, 2025).  A categorical 15% dictate is not a procedure.  Nor does the Rate Cap Policy \nestablish “general decision-making criteria.”  Criteria are “standard[s] on which a judgment or \ndecision  may  be  based.”    Criterion,  M-W.com,  https://www.merriam-\nwebster.com/dictionary/criterion (last visited Apr. 14, 2025).  Again, a categorical 15% dictate is \nnot “general . . . criteria.”   \n72.  Moreover, the plain text of this provision states that DOE will  follow those \npolicies, procedures, and criteria to seek and justify deviations.  In other words: first the policies, \nprocedures, and criteria will be enacted, and then DOE will use them to seek and justify deviations \nfrom the negotiated baseline.   DOE  skipped the first step: it  never enacted any policies, \nprocedures, or criteria that it would subsequently rely upon to “seek” or “justify” changes to the \nbaseline.  It just set rates at 15% for all universities. \n73.  Reinforcing  the  point, Section  200.414(c)(3)  authorizes  “deviations” from \nnegotiated rates.    A “deviation” is  a  “departure from a  standard or  norm.”   Deviation, \nDictionary.com, https://www.dictionary.com/browse/deviation (last visited Apr. 14, 2025).  And \nauthority to provide for “deviations” does not empower DOE to eliminate the standard use of \nnegotiated rates across broad swathes of institutions; rather, negotiated rates must remain the \nnorm, with deviations just narrow exceptions.  Cf. MCI Telecomms. Corp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 27 of 41\n \n512 U.S. 218, 228–29 (1994) (holding that statutory authority to “modify” a requirement “does \nnot contemplate fundamental changes”); Biden v. Nebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2368 (2023) \n(similar).    \n74.  The Rate Cap Policy also violates Section 200.414(f).  That provision states that \nrecipients that do not have a negotiated indirect cost rate “may elect to charge a de minimis rate \nof up to 15 percent.”  The provision then states that “[r]ecipients and subrecipients are not \nrequired to use the de minimis rate.”  The Rate Cap Policy violates this provision by “setting a \nstandardized 15 percent indirect cost rate for all grant awards to IHEs.”  Accord 89 Fed. Reg. \n30,046 (April 22, 2024) (“Other sections of the guidance adequately explain that recipients and \nsubrecipients have a right to negotiate a rate, rather than using the de minimis rate.”).   \nCount II \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Unlawful Termination of Existing Grants in Violation of 2 C.F.R. 200.340, 200.414(c), and \nAppendix III) \n \n75.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.  \n76.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n77.  Under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a), agencies may terminate grants on enumerated \ngrounds: “if the recipient or subrecipient fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award,” id. § 200.340(a)(1); “with the consent of the recipient,” id. § 200.340(a)(2); or \n“pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award, including, to the extent authorized by \nlaw, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities,” id. § 200.340(a)(4). \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 28 of 41\n \n78.  Citing this regulation, the Rate Cap Policy states that DOE will “terminate all \ngrant awards to IHEs that do not conform with” its 15% cap.   \n79.  None of the enumerated grounds, however, permit agencies to terminate grants on \nthe ground that the agencies would prefer to use a different indirect cost rates.  In particular, while \nthe regulation in some circumstances permits terminations “if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities,” the Rate Cap Policy does not conclude that any “award[s]” \nno longer effectuate DOE’s priorities.  A desire to use a different indirect cost rate does not mean \nthat the “award” no longer effectuates DOE priorities. \n80.  Terminating existing grants based on the Rate Cap Policy would also violate 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414(c)(4), which states: “The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding \nopportunity, the policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved \nunder paragraph (e).”  The Federal Register notice promulgating this provision makes clear that \nany attempt to depart from negotiated rates must first be “established” and then “inclu[ded] . . . \nin the announcement of funding opportunity.”  78 Fed. Reg. 78,590, 78,600 (Dec. 26, 2013).  \nMoreover, this provision underscores why Section 200.340(a) cannot provide the authority that \nthe Rate Cap Policy claims: On the Rate Cap Policy’s reading, this provision’s limits would be \nmeaningless.    Agencies  could  simply  terminate  existing  grants  and  thereby evade  the \nrequirements of Section 200.414(c)(4).    \n81.    Section C.7.a of Appendix III to Part 200, which provides rules for calculating \nindirect cost rates, confirms the unlawfulness of the Rate Cap Policy’s termination directive.  That \nprovision states in relevant part: “Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of § 200.414, Federal \nagencies must use the negotiated rates in effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life \nof the Federal award.   Award levels for Federal awards may not be adjusted in future years as a \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 29 of 41\n \nresult of changes in negotiated rates.”  As this language reflects, the general rule is that the \ngovernment-wide negotiated rate for a particular grantee that is in effect at the beginning of an \naward applies throughout the life of the award, even if that government-wide negotiated rate is \nrenegotiated by a cognizant agency during the life of the award.  The “except[ion]” is when a \ndifferent  rate  from  the  government-wide negotiated  rate  is  set  via  the  procedures in \n§ 200.414(c)(1).  Moreover, under Section 200.414(c), a change to the policies, procedures, and \ncriteria governing the justification for deviations—which is what the Rate Cap Policy purports to \ndo—must occur when the grant is being negotiated, not in the middle of an existing grant.  Section \nC.7.a does not authorize a change for awards that DOE has already approved and upon which a \ngrantee has already relied.  And Section 200.340(a)’s termination authority cannot be read to \nrender a nullity the protections of Section C.7.a of Appendix III to Part 200.  \nCount III \n \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Illegal Departure from Cost Recovery Regulations) \n82.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n83.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n84.  Federal  regulations  and  decades  of  Executive  Branch  practice  establish \nsubstantive and procedural guidelines governing the recovery of indirect costs, which DOE’s \nRate Cap Policy blatantly violates. \n85.  Substantively, the governing regulations dictate that grantees will recover the \nactual indirect costs that are reasonable and allocable to federal projects. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 30 of 41\n \na.  The bedrock principle is: “The total cost of a Federal award is the sum of the \nallowable direct and allocable indirect costs minus any applicable credits.”  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.402.  \nb.  The regulations establish detailed guidelines designed to ensure that grantees \nrecover their actual allocable indirect costs.  See generally 2 C.F.R. § 200.414; \naccord Appendix III.A (“Indirect (F&A) costs are those that are incurred for \ncommon or  joint  objectives and therefore cannot be identified readily and \nspecifically with a particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any \nother institutional activity”); id. Appendix III.A.2.e.1 (“Indirect (F&A) costs are \nthe broad categories of costs discussed in Section B.1.”). \n86.  By slashing indirect cost rates to 15%, DOE will prevent grantees from recovering \ntheir indirect costs.   \n87.  DOE’s Rate Cap Policy does not even purport to adhere to the principle that \ngrantees should recover their indirect costs.  Instead, it assigns an arbitrary 15% indirect cost \nrecovery rate across all universities simply because DOE has unilaterally decided that universities \nshould be getting less money. \n88.  Procedurally, federal regulations prescribe a complex process for negotiating an \nindirect cost recovery rate. \na.  Institutions must document and submit costs in painstaking detail to support that \nprocess.  Subpart E of part 200 of Title 2 “establishes principles for determining \nallowable costs incurred by recipients and subrecipients under Federal awards.”  2 \nC.F.R. § 200.100(c).  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(e) stipulates that a set of appendices will \nset forth in detail “[r]equirements for development and submission of indirect cost \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 31 of 41\n \nrate  proposals and cost  allocation plans.”   Those appendices contain “the \ndocumentation prepared by a recipient to substantiate its request to establish an \nindirect cost rate.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (definition of “Indirect cost rate proposal”).  \nFor universities, Appendix III to Part 200 establishes the criteria for identifying \nand computing indirect facilities and administration costs for Institutions of \nHigher  Education (IHEs).    Id. §  200.414(e)(1).   The  Appendix details the \nprocesses for a grant recipient to document a significant range of costs and how \nthose costs should be allocated among multiple government projects.  \nb.  Audits are the mechanism then used to determine what is charged to a federal \naward.  2 C.F.R. § 200.501(b) requires that a “non-Federal entity that expends \n$1,000,000 or more in Federal awards during the non-Federal entity’s fiscal year \nmust have a single audit conducted in accordance with § 200.514,” except if it \nelects to have a program-specific audit.  This audit is performed annually, and it \nmust be conducted in accordance with articulated standards.   See 2 C.F.R. \n§§ 200.504, 200.514.  An auditor may identify any “questioned cost,” which is \ndefined as “an amount, expended or received from a Federal award, that in the \nauditor’s judgment:” (1) “[i]s noncompliant or suspected noncompliant with \nFederal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award;” \n(2)  “[a]t  the  time  of the  audit, lacked adequate documentation to  support \ncompliance;” or (3) “[a]ppeared unreasonable and did not reflect the actions a \nprudent person would take in the circumstances.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1 (definition of \n“Questioned cost”).  The results of the audit and any questioned costs are factored \ninto negotiation of indirect cost rates.  See Appendix III to Part 200. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 32 of 41\n \n89.  DOE ignored that detailed process.  Instead, it arbitrarily determined that all \nuniversities would recover at a 15% rate, violating the regulations’ substantive commands and \nrendering that entire regulatory process meaningless. \nCount IV \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act – Arbitrary and Capricious \n90.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n91.  The APA provides that courts “shall . . . hold unlawful and set aside agency action” \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n92.  The Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious for many reasons. \n93.  DOE’s justification consists of the following: “While the Department is cognizant \nthat many grant recipients use indirect cost payments to effectuate research funded by the \nDepartment’s grant awards, these payments are not for the Department’s direct research funding. \nSee 89 Fed. Reg. 30046-30093. As these funds are entrusted to the Department by the American \npeople, the Department must ensure it is putting them to appropriate use on grant programs. To \nimprove efficiency and curtail costs where appropriate, the Department seeks to better balance \nthe financial needs of grant recipients with the Department’s obligation to responsibly manage \nfederal funds.”   \n94.  First, this justification is entirely conclusory and violates DOE’s obligation “to \nexamine[] ‘the relevant data’ and articulate[] ‘a satisfactory explanation’ for [the] decision, \n‘including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Dep’t of \nCommerce, 588 U.S. at 773 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  DOE denigrates “indirect cost \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 33 of 41\n \npayments” as “not for the Department’s direct research funding.”  But DOE ignores that indirect \ncosts are often necessary for DOE’s own research to continue: Cutting-edge research, for \nexample, requires physical infrastructure and equipment, ethics review boards, and many other \ncosts that are not traceable to specific grants but are nonetheless essential for the work.  DOE also \nignores that indirect costs often differ from direct costs only in that they fund multiple research \nprojects: For example, if an administrative employee supports three DOE grants, one NIH grant, \nand one private grant, their salary might be an indirect cost—but it would be essential for the \nwork on DOE’s grant, underscoring the irrationality of DOE’s suggestion that indirect cost \npayments are less valuable than direct research funding.  Then, DOE avers that it “must ensure it \nis  putting [the  American people’s funds] to appropriate use on grant  programs,” without \nexplaining why indirect costs are not an appropriate use.  Next, DOE states that the Rate Cap \nPolicy will “improve efficiency and curtail costs where appropriate,” without explaining how \nslashing indirect funding will improve efficiency and ignoring that the Rate Cap Policy will cut \nfunding across the board, not just “curtail[ing] costs where appropriate.”  Finally, DOE says that \nthe Rate Cap Policy “seeks to better balance the financial needs of grant recipients with the \nDepartment’s obligation  to  responsibly manage  federal  funds,” without  explaining  why \nmaintaining its decades-long approach to indirect costs is inconsistent with its obligation to \nresponsibly manage federal funds. \n95.  Second, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it reflects a new \npolicy resting upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay the prior policy of OMB \nand DOE and that are also wrong.  The prior policy rested on the view that a uniform indirect \ncost rate was not appropriate, and that negotiated rates should be both institution-specific and—\n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 34 of 41\n \nin most cases—substantially higher.  The Rate Cap Policy provides no explanation for this \nreversal in course. \n96.  Moreover, DOE  ignores what  Congress itself said about a nearly identical \nproposal to cap NIH indirect cost rates.  According to the House of Representatives, “[t]he \nAdministration’s proposal to  drastically reduce and  cap  reimbursement of  facilities  and \nadministrative (F&A) costs to research institutions is misguided and would have a devastating \nimpact on biomedical research across the country.”  H.R. Rep. No. 115-244, at 50 (2017).  And \naccording to the Senate, “[t]he methodology for negotiating indirect costs has been in place since \n1965, and rates have remained largely stable . . . for decades. The Administration’s proposal \nwould radically change the nature of the Federal Government’s relationship with the research \ncommunity, abandoning the Government’s long-established responsibility for underwriting much \nof the Nation’s research infrastructure, and jeopardizing biomedical research nationwide.  The \nCommittee has not  seen any details of the proposal that might  explain how it  could be \naccomplished without throwing research programs across the country into disarray.”  S. Rep. No. \n115-150, at 109 (2017).  What was true of biomedical research is just as true of the research \nfunded by DOE.  And while the appropriations rider was co-extensive with the specific proposal \nbefore it (cutting indirect cost rates for NIH grantees), DOE did not so much as consider the \nreasons why Congress concluded that a virtually identical proposed categorical cap would be \ndevasting to research.  Nor did those concerns merely lurk in the Congressional Record: Just a \nmonth before the Rate Cap Policy issued, the NIH court had described those concerns at length.   \n97.  Third, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it ignores obvious \nproblems with its categorical 15% cap, including how that cap will thwart DOE’s stated goals.  \nThe press release accompanying Rate Cap Policy says that it “aim[s] at . . . continuing to expand \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 35 of 41\n \nAmerican innovation and scientific research.”  But DOE ignores, again, that indirect costs are \ncritical to supporting and maintaining world-class research.  Nor does it consider that the across-\nthe-board 15% rate amounts to a decision to fund only part of the costs of research DOE supports, \nand ultimately amounts simply to a decision to fund less research of particular types—including \nresearch that relies heavily on expensive overhead, as cutting-edge research often does.  DOE \ndoes not explain how the Rate Cap Policy is consistent with its own stated goal of continuing to \npromote American innovation and cutting edge research. \n98.  Fourth, Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because DOE fails to explain \nwhy its own audits of indirect costs would not accomplish the task of “improv[ing] efficiency \nand curtail[ing] costs where appropriate.”  To the contrary, because audits look at specific costs, \nthey can accomplish what DOE’s blunderbuss policy cannot—identifying specific costs that can \nbe appropriately curtailed.   \n99.  Fifth, the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious because it ignores the \nreliance interests of the research institutions receiving federal funding and does not provide an \nexplanation that accounts for those reliance interests.  As the press release accompanying the Rate \nCap Policy says, “the average rate of indirect costs incurred by grant recipients at colleges and \nuniversities is more than 30%.”  The Rate Cap Policy thus purports to slash indirect cost recovery \nby at least half—and often much more.  With regard to existing grants, the reliance interests are \nobvious: budgets have already been determined and research benefitting from the funding has \nalready started.  But even with respect to new grants, universities have structured their budgetary \naffairs on the understanding that federal agencies will follow through by paying their legally \nrequired cost reimbursement using the longstanding practice of using negotiated indirect costs \nand rates.  Universities have accordingly made costly decisions about long-term investments, \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 36 of 41\n \nsuch as what physical infrastructure should be built, in reliance on negotiated rates with federal \nagencies allowing for the recovery of some such costs via depreciation, as well as the OMB \nregulations generally requiring agencies to use a negotiated indirect cost rate and permitting \ndeviations from that rate only in narrowly limited circumstances.   \n100.  Sixth,  the  Rate  Cap  Policy  is  arbitrary  and  capricious because,  without \nexplanation, it imposes its new categorical 15% cap only on universities, and not other DOE grant \nrecipients.  If (counterfactually) this categorical cap improved efficiency or reflected responsible \nstewardship of federal funds, DOE does not explain why it  imposed that policy on only \nuniversities.  The press release accompanying the policy states that the average indirect cost rate \nfor universities is “a significantly higher rate than other for profit, non-profit and state and local \ngovernment grant awardees.”  But DOE does not account for the possibility that universities’ \nrates are higher because they engage in a larger proportion of cutting-edge research, which \ntypically has higher indirect costs.  Nor does DOE say what average indirect cost rates are for \n“for profit, non-profit and state and local government grant awardees” or explain why, whatever \nthose percentages are, those institutions should not be subject to the same 15% cap. \n101.  Seventh, the Rate Cap Policy does not explain why the appropriate rate for all \nuniversity recipients is 15%.  The governing regulations identify this amount as the “de minimis \nrate.”  2 C.F.R. 200.414(f).  A “de minimis rate” does not fit every university recipient. \nCount V \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \n(Violation of Authorizing Statutes) \n1.  All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth \nherein.   \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 37 of 41\n \n2.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are not \nin accordance with law.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n3.  DOE awards research grants  pursuant to various statutes, and Congress has \nauthorized the use of “predetermined fixed-percentage rates” for “payment of reimbursable \nindirect costs” attributable to research agreements with educational institutions.  Act of Sept. 5, \n1962, Pub. L. No. 87-638, 76 Stat. 437, codified at 41 U.S.C. § 4708. \n4.  The Rate Cap Policy violates these statutes because it does not set a rate for \n“payment of reimbursable indirect costs” within the meaning of the statute.  It simply adopts an \narbitrary 15% figure. \n5.  As alleged above, moreover, the Rate Cap Policy is likely to have devastating \neffects across the country, not only on the research institutions themselves but also the many \npeople who depend on the research that will be crippled by the Rate Cap Policy.  The Supreme \nCourt has underscored that agencies may not enact sweeping rules of this sort without express \ncongressional authorization.  In considering whether agency action is authorized by statute, courts \nconsider whether the “history and breadth of the authority that [the agency] has asserted” and the \n“economic and political significance of that assertion” counsel in favor of “hesitat[ing] before \nconcluding that Congress meant to confer such authority.”  West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, \n721 (2022) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco \nCorp., 529 U.S. 120, 159–60 (2000)).  Here, no Act of Congress expressly authorizes DOE to \ndevastate research by enacting a radical change from institution-specific negotiated rates to a \nsingle across-the-board rate for all universities.  Thus, under the major questions doctrine, DOE \ncannot impose such a change unilaterally.  \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 38 of 41\n \n6.  Because Congress did not expressly authorize DOE to obliterate the cutting-edge \nresearch it has long funded, the Rate Cap Policy is invalid.  \nCount VI \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—In Excess of Statutory Authority \n(Retroactivity) \n102.  Plaintiffs restate and reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein.   \n103.  The APA directs courts to hold unlawful and set aside agency actions that are in \nexcess of statutory authority.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C).   \n104.  “[A] statutory grant of legislative rulemaking authority will not, as a general \nmatter, be understood to encompass the power to promulgate retroactive rules unless that power \nis conveyed by Congress in express terms.”  Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. 204, \n208 (1988). \n105.  The Rate Cap Policy is a retroactive action because it “impair[s] rights a party \npossessed when [it] acted, increase[s] a party’s liability for past conduct, [and] impose[s] new \nduties with respect to transactions already completed.”  Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. \n244, 280 (1994).   \n106.  Congress did not authorize DOE to retroactively modify indirect cost rates when \nit enacted DOE’s grantmaking authority, or in any other statute.  Nor can DOE evade this problem \nby purporting to apply the 15% cap only to new grants while terminating all existing grants with \nhigher caps.  The reduced rate necessarily undermines project budgets that were previously \napproved and upsets institutions’ commitments made in reliance upon those budgets.   \n107.  Because DOE’s retroactive action is in excess of its statutory authority, the Rate \nCap Notice is invalid.  \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912     Document 1     Filed 04/14/25     Page 39 of 41\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully pray for the following relief:  \na.  Vacatur of the Rate Cap Policy; \nb.  Declaratory judgment finding the Rate Cap Policy invalid, arbitrary and capricious, \nand contrary to law;  \nc.  An injunction preliminarily and permanently prohibiting Defendants, their agents, \nand anyone acting in concert or participation with Defendants from implementing, \ninstituting, maintaining, or giving effect to the Rate Cap Policy in any form; from \notherwise modifying negotiated indirect cost rates except as permitted by statute and \nby the regulations of OMB; and from terminating any grants pursuant to the Rate Cap \nPolicy or based on a grantee’s refusal to accept a indirect cost rate less than their \nnegotiated rate; \nd.

If not enjoined, the Rate Cap Policy will result in immediate and \nirreversible harm, starting as soon as today, to the Plaintiffs here: the Association of American \nUniversities (“AAU”), the American Council on Education (“ACE”), the Association of Public \n1 See Policy Flash, Adjusting Department of Energy Grant Policy for Institutions of Higher \nEducation (IHE)  (April  11, 2025), available at  https://www.energy.gov/articles/department-\nenergy-overhauls-policy-college-and-university-research-saving-405-million. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 3     Filed 04/14/25     Page 2 of 5\n \nand Land-Grant Universities (“APLU”), and several individual universities.   \nPlaintiffs respectfully move the Court, pursuant to Fed.

For the foregoing \nreasons, the Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED.      \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 2 of 49\nI.  BACKGROUND  \nA.  Factual Background  \n1.  DOE Funding for Indirect Costs \nThe federal government awards billions of dollars each year to universities to support \nresearch that can effectively further the DOE’s goals.  [Compl. ¶ 27].  In fact, the majority of \nDOE-funded research occurs at outside institutions—and, as relevant here, IHEs—which allows \nthe DOE to fund a wide array of institutions, promote competition for research grants, and \nfacilitate the training of the next generation of researchers.  [Id. ¶ 29].  During fiscal year 2023, \nthe DOE awarded more than $2.6 billion to nearly 400 different universities.  [Id.].  As such, at \nany given time, many individual research universities are likely depending on DOE grants to \nsupport independent research projects across multiple departments and research centers.  [Id. \n¶ 30].  This DOE-funded research at universities has made the United States a world leader in \nscience, resulting in innumerable scientific breakthroughs, all to the benefit of the United States \nand the rest of the world, as evidenced by the fact that dozens of DOE-supported scientists have \nearned Nobel Prizes for their groundbreaking work.  [Id. ¶¶ 27, 28].   \nUniversities and other grant recipients generally do not receive lump-sum grants from the \nDOE.  [Compl. ¶ 34].  Rather, they use cost-based accounting systems whereby the universities \nfirst incur expenses and then recover their actual, documented direct and indirect costs for \nconducting their research.  [Id. ¶¶ 34, 35].  “Direct costs” are those costs which can be readily \nattributed to a specific research project; for example, the salary of a graduate student assigned to \na particular research project or the cost of a specialized piece of equipment purchased for a \nparticular research project.   [Id.].  “Indirect costs,” on the other hand, are costs that are necessary \n2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 3 of 49\nfor research but support multiple research projects, making them more difficult to trace back to a \nspecific project.  [Id. ¶ 36].   \nIndirect costs are comprised of “facilities” and “administration” costs (and are often \nreferred to as “F&A costs”).  [Compl. ¶ 37 (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(a))]; see also 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.1 (noting that, for IHEs, the term “facilities and administrative (F&A) cost is often used to \nrefer to indirect costs”).  The “facilities” costs are “defined as depreciation on buildings, \nequipment, and capital improvements, interest on debt associated with certain buildings, \nequipment and capital improvements, and operations and maintenance expenses.”  [Compl. ¶ 37 \n(quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(a))].  This category includes the costs of the physical infrastructure \nnecessary for carrying out research, such as the construction and maintenance of buildings, \nincluding specialized facilities and laboratories.  [Id.].  These costs are indirect because a single \nbuilding, such as a state-of-the-art nuclear facility, might house numerous research groups \nengaged in multiple distinct projects.  [Id.].  The “administration” costs are defined as “general \nadministration and general expenses such as the director’s office, accounting, personnel, and all \nother types of expenditures not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of ‘Facilities.’”  \n[Id. ¶ 38 (quoting 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(a))].  This category includes costs related to the \nadministrative and compliance activities required to conduct federally sponsored research, such \nas information technology professionals, experts on safety and security, technical staff, and many \nothers.  [Id.].  These are indirect costs because a single employee or group of employees will \ntypically handle these necessary administrative activities across multiple DOE grants.  [Id.].  \nBecause of caps on administrative costs, universities often contribute a significant amount of \ntheir own funds to cover such costs, thereby subsidizing the work funded by grants in what can \nbe characterized as a mutually beneficial partnership.  [Id.].    \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 4 of 49\nThe computation and determination of indirect costs are subject to extensive regulation, \ndiscussed further infra, and then fixed for a specific period of time in recognition of the \ninstitutions’ needs for predictability and to allow proper planning.  [Compl. ¶¶ 39–50].  The \nregulations require research institutions to express their indirect costs as a rate that is multiplied \nby the overhead-bearing direct costs of each individual research grant associated with those \ncosts, with the purpose of ensuring that indirect costs are allocated fairly across supported \nprojects.  [Id. ¶ 39].  Resource-intensive research projects are typically the most expensive and \nare allocated a larger share of indirect costs.  [Id.].  Plaintiffs provide a simplified example:  \nSuppose a single laboratory houses two research projects—one with $75,000 of annual \noverhead-bearing costs and the other with $25,000—and that the laboratory’s sole indirect cost is \nelectricity, which costs $10,000 per year.  [Id.].  Because the cost of electricity is 10 percent of \nthe overhead-bearing direct costs (or, $100,000), the indirect cost rate would be 10 percent.  \n[Id.].  Thus, $7,500 of electricity costs would be allocated to the first project, and $2,500 would \nbe allocated to the second project.  [Id.]. \nBecause different institutions conduct different types of research, negotiated rates vary \nsignificantly from institution to institution.  [Compl. ¶ 48].  Certain facilities, like specialized \nlaboratories, and certain types of research are more expensive than others.  [Id.].  As such, \ninstitutions with higher-than-average negotiated indirect cost rates are typically those that \nsupport facility-intensive types of research, such as state of the art nuclear and energy research.  \n[Id. ¶ 49].  Many Plaintiffs in this action have indirect cost rates exceeding 50 or 60 percent.  \nSee, e.g., [ECF No. 2-1 at ¶ 11 (“Many of the AAU’s member universities have negotiated an \nindirect cost rate that is significantly higher than 15 percent, often in the 50-to-60-percent \nrange.”)]; [ECF No. 2-4 ¶ 13 (Cornell University has a negotiated indirect cost rate of 64 \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 5 of 49\npercent)]; [ECF No. 2-5 ¶ 12 (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign has a negotiated indirect \ncost rate of 58.6 percent)]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶ 10 (MIT has a negotiated indirect cost rate of 59 \npercent)]; [ECF No. 2-7 ¶ 11 (University of Michigan has a negotiated indirect cost rate of 56 \npercent)]. \n2.  Regulatory Framework  \nDOE grants to IHEs are, and have long been, issued pursuant to an elaborate, well-\nestablished legislative and regulatory framework that facilitates long range planning by \nmaintaining predictability in funding levels.  [Compl. ¶¶ 3–4, 8, 31].  Congress has authorized \nthe DOE to provide grants under various statutes, and it has further permitted agencies to set \nindirect cost rates in connection with such grants.  [Id. ¶ 31(citing 41 U.S.C. § 4708)]; see also \n[id. ¶ 36 (explaining that, in 1962, Congress authorized the use of “predetermined fixed-\npercentage rates” for “payment of reimbursable indirect costs” attributable to research \nagreements with educational institutions)].  Congress also instructed the Office of Management \nand Budget (“OMB”) to issue general guidance on fiscal administration issues.  [Compl. ¶ 31 \n(citing 31 U.S.C. § 503(a), (b)(2)(C))].  Pursuant to statutory authority, OMB has in turn \nestablished uniform guidance for agencies to administer grants under the agencies’ purview, [id. \n(citing 2 C.F.R. pt. 200)], which the DOE has adopted into its own regulations, [id. (citing 2 \nC.F.R. § 910.120)].  \nThese regulations prescribe a detailed and well-settled methodology for negotiating \nindirect cost rates with IHEs, [Compl. ¶ 40], and establish that “negotiation of predetermined \nrates for indirect (F&A) costs for a period of two to four years should be the norm,”  2 C.F.R. pt. \n200, app. III(C)(4).  The process begins when a single agency (the “cognizant agency”) \nnegotiates an indirect cost rate with an institution.  Id. at app. III(C)(11).  For IHEs, rates are \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 6 of 49\ngenerally negotiated by either the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) or the \nDepartment of Defense’s Office of Naval Research (“DOD”).  [Compl. ¶ 3 (citing 2 C.F.R. pt. \n200, app. III(C)(11)(a)(1))].  To facilitate these negotiations, the institutions are required to \nconduct and then submit to their federal agency comprehensive cost analyses that follow detailed \nfederal cost accounting guidelines governing reasonable and allowable indirect costs.  [Id. ¶ 41].  \nFor example, an institution which seeks to recover the cost of building maintenance must \ndocument and allocate the maintenance costs across research and non-research programs.  [Id.].  \nThe federal agency then reviews and verifies these proposals and determines the institution’s \nindirect cost rate, which reflects actual, verified costs incurred by the institution.  [Id. ¶ 42].  \nAfter costs are incurred, federal agencies audit institutions to ensure that the negotiated indirect \ncost rate approximates to the actual indirect costs that were incurred, with the understanding that \nthe rate can be adjusted if the audit establishes that it does not.  [Id. ¶ 44].  \nOnce negotiated with the cognizant agency, the final negotiated indirect cost rate is \nmemorialized in writing, in a document commonly referred to as a “Negotiated Indirect Cost \nRate Agreement,” or “NICRA.”  [ECF No. 60 ¶ 4]; see also [ECF No. 2-16 ¶ 11 (explaining \nUniversity of Wisconsin-Madison “has a Negotiated Indirect Cost Rate Agreement (‘NICRA’) \nwith DHHS, covering all federal agencies”); [ECF No. 2-8 ¶ 10 (same regarding Michigan State \nUniversity)].  An authorized representative for both the cognizant agency and the individual IHE \nsigns the NICRA.  [ECF No. 60 ¶ 4].  The NICRA is then used for all of an IHE’s grants across \nthe entire federal government during the period that the negotiated rate is in effect, which is \ntypically at least one year, although in some cases that rate can remain in effect for up to four \nyears.  [Compl. ¶¶ 41, 43].   \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 7 of 49\nAs such, when the DOE issues a Notice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”), which is \nwhat begins the DOE’s competitive grantmaking process, an IHE applying for that funding will \nsubmit its NICRA as part of the application process.  [ECF No. 60 ¶ 5]; see also [Compl. ¶ 32 \n(citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.204)].  After a formal review process that includes peer review, the DOE \nissues a legally binding Notice of Award (“NOA”) to selected grant recipients stating that funds \nmay be requested from the agency.  [Compl. ¶ 33 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(b)(7))]; [ECF No. \n60 ¶¶ 5–6].  A NOA is issued for the initial budget period and then each subsequent budget \nperiod, and it reflects any future-year understandings about the continuation of the funded \nproject.  [Compl. ¶ 33 (citing 2 C.F.R. § 200.211(c)(1)(iv))].   \nThe negotiated indirect cost rate, memorialized in the NICRA, “must be accepted by all \nfederal agencies” granting awards unless certain exceptions apply.  As relevant here, Section \n(c)(1) establishes the conditions under which the awarding agency is permitted use a different \nrate.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1) (“Section (c)”); see also [Compl. ¶¶ 3, 8].  Specifically, Section \n(c)(1) provides that the awarding agency “may use a different rate” from the NICRA “for either a \nclass of Federal awards or a single Federal award” when “approved by the awarding Federal \nagency in accordance with [2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3)].”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).  A “class of \nFederal awards” is defined as “a group of Federal awards either awarded under a specific \nprogram or group of programs or to a specific type of recipient or group of recipients to which \nspecific provisions or exceptions may apply.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  Section (c)(3), in turn, requires \nthat “[t]he Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, procedures \nand general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek and justify \ndeviations from negotiated rates.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(3).  Section (c)(2) requires the agency \nto notify OMB of any approved deviations, and Section (c)(4) requires the agency to include the \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 8 of 49\npolicies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement in the notice of funding opportunity.  2 \nC.F.R. §§ 200.414(c)(2), (4).  \n3.  Rate Cap Policy \nOn Friday, April 11, 2025, the DOE issued the Rate Cap Policy, titled “Adjusting \nDepartment of Energy Grant Policy for Institutes of Higher Education (IHE).”  [Compl. ¶ 60]; \nsee also [ECF No. 2 at 2–3].  The Rate Cap Policy announced that “hereinafter, the Department \nwill no longer use the negotiated indirect cost rate for grants awarded to IHEs.  Instead, it is \nsetting a standardized 15 percent indirect cost rate for all grant awards to IHEs.”  [ECF No. 2 at \n3].  The Rate Cap Policy further provides that “[a]ll future Department grant awards to IHEs will \ndefault to this 15 percent indirect cost rate” and that “the Department is undertaking action to \nterminate all grant awards to IHEs that do not conform with this updated policy.”  [Id.]. \nThe Rate Cap Policy purports to justify this sweeping change by stating 1) “[t]his system \nwill better balance the Department’s twin aims of funding meaningful research and upholding its \nfiduciary duties to the American people,” and 2) “[t]o improve efficiency and curtail costs where \nappropriate, the Department seeks to better balance the financial needs of grant recipients with \nthe Department’s obligation to responsibly manage federal funds.”  [ECF No. 2 at 3].  By its \nterms, the Rate Cap Policy applies this supposedly necessary limit on indirect cost rates “only \nwith respect to” IHEs, and not to other recipients of DOE grants.  [Id. at 2].  \nSince the Rate Cap Policy was issued, at least one IHE, Cornell, has received a letter \nconditionally terminating its awards “in accordance with” the new policy.  [ECF No. 33-1].  \nSpecifically, the letter stated that “[p]ursuant to the Department’s policy memorandum dated \nApril 11, 2025 . . . the Department has undertaken a review of all Department grant awards to \nensure that the awards comply with this updated Department policy,” and that “[d]uring this \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 9 of 49\nreview, the Department determined that [certain Cornell] grants . . . are not currently in \ncompliance with the policy memorandum.”  [Id. at 8].  The letter further advised that Cornell \ncould “avoid termination of these awards” by agreeing to “an updated indirect cost rate of 15 \npercent.”  [Id.].  Another IHE, Arizona State University, received an email regarding an invoice \npreviously submitted for a DOE funded project, which stated that “[d]ue to the Policy Flash from \nDOE, and the pending process changes, currently invoices from IHEs are not being \nprocessed . . . The option we have at this time is for the invoice to be submitted without any \nindirect charges and we can pay the direct costs.”  [ECF No. 53-1 at 7].   \n4.  Prior Attempts to Limit Indirect Cost Funding \n  This is not the government’s—or even this administration’s—first attempt to limit \nindirect funding costs.  [Compl. ¶¶ 5, 6].  In 2017, the then-administration released a budget \nproposal that would have slashed indirect cost rates for the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) \nto 10 percent.  [Id. ¶ 51].  The proposal was met with “widespread criticism and alarm,” \nparticularly in Congress, which enacted a bipartisan appropriations rider that provided that \nregulator “provisions relating to indirect costs . . . including with respect to the approval of \ndeviations from negotiated rates[] shall continue to apply to [NIH] to the same extent and in the \nsame manner.”  [Id. ¶¶ 52–53].  Both the House and Senate Report on the rider identified serious \nproblems with the proposal, observing that it would “radically change the nature of the Federal \nGovernment’s relationship with the research community” by altering a methodology for indirect \nrates that “has been in place since 1965,” and concluded that the proposal was “misguided and \nwould have a devastating impact on biomedical research across the country.”  [Id. ¶ 5 (first citing \nS. Rep. No. 115-150, at 109 (2017); and then citing H.R. Rep. No. 115-244, at 50 (2017))].  The \nrider that was subsequently enacted has been repeatedly reenacted ever since.  [Id. ¶ 55].   \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 10 of 49\n  Despite Congress’ evidenced commitment to the grant funding regime, in February 2025, \nthe current administration tried again, with NIH issuing a notice that stated that it was “imposing \na standard indirect cost rate on all grants of 15%” for all existing and future grant awards for \nbiomedical research, with an effective date of February 10, 2025.  [Compl. ¶¶ 6, 57 (quoting \nNIH, Supplemental Guidance to the 2024 NIH Grants Policy Statement: Indirect Cost Rates (or, \nthe “NIH Rate Change Notice”), NOT-OD-25-068 (Feb. 7, 2025))].  Shortly thereafter, three sets \nof plaintiffs—a group of 22 states, a group of five medical associations, and a group of 17 \nassociations and universities, including many of the plaintiffs in the present action—filed \ncomplaints and motions for temporary restraining orders, arguing that the NIH Rate Change \nNotice was unlawful under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  [Id. ¶ 58].   \n  Another session of this Court found that the serious consequences of the NIH Rate \nChange Notice warranted issuance of a nationwide temporary restraining order to maintain the \nstatus quo until the matter could be fully addressed, following which the Court also issued a \nnationwide preliminary injunction.  [Compl. ¶ 59]; see also Massachusetts v. Nat’l Instits. of \nHealth, No. 25-cv-10338, 2025 WL 702163, at *1 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025), judgment entered, \nNo. 25-cv-10338, 2025 WL 1063760 (D. Mass. Apr. 4, 2025) (“NIH”).  The Court found that the \nadministration had not only flouted the appropriations rider that Congress had enacted in the \nwake of the 2017 NIH episode but also that it had violated the government-wide regulations \ngoverning indirect cost rates and the reasoned decision-making requirements of the APA.  \n[Compl ¶ 6].  \nB.  Procedural History  \nOn April 14, 2025, Plaintiffs filed their Complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief.  See [Compl.].  They also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (“TRO”), [ECF \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 11 of 49\nNo. 3], which the Court granted on April 16, 2025, [ECF No. 34].  Defendants submitted an \nopposition on April 22, 2025, [ECF No. 47], and Plaintiffs filed a further reply in support of their \nmotion on April 25, 2025, [ECF No. 53].  \nThe Court held a hearing on the motion for injunctive relief on April 28, 2025, at which \ntime it took the motion for injunctive relief under advisement.  [ECF No. 54].  \nII.  DISTRICT COURT JURISDICTION  \nAs a threshold matter, Defendants assert that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover Plaintiffs’ claims because the waiver of sovereign immunity in the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702, \ndoes not extend to actions of contract, which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of \nFederal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491.  [ECF No. 47 at 6–8].  Plaintiffs, who \ncontend they have brought a proper challenge under the APA, disagree that the Tucker Act \ndivests this Court of jurisdiction.  [ECF No. 19 at 24–29]; [ECF No. 53 at 7–10].  \nThe APA “confers a general cause of action upon persons ‘adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.’”  Block v. Cmty. Nutrition \nInst., 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  The APA’s waiver of sovereign \nimmunity, however, “does not apply ‘if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or \nimpliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’”  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 \n(2025) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  One such statute, the Tucker Act, vests jurisdiction in the \nUnited States Court of Federal Claims with respect to “any claim against the United States \nfounded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive \ndepartment, or upon any express or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or \nunliquidated damages in cases not sounding in tort.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  Although “[t]he \n‘jurisdictional boundary’ between the Tucker Act and [APA] is well-traversed by litigants \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 12 of 49\nseeking relief against the federal government,. . . the boundary’s precise contours remain \nelusive.”  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *5 (quoting Suburban Mortg. Assocs., Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHous. & Urb. Dev., 480 F.3d 1116, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2007)).   \nBoth parties focus their dispute on a recent per curium decision from the United States \nSupreme Court, Department of Education v. California (“California”), which granted a stay of a \ntemporary restraining order issued by another session of this Court pending appeal of that order.  \nThat suit arose after the Department of Education sent termination letters to almost all awardees \nof Teacher Quality Partnership (TQP) and Supporting Effective Educator Development (SEED) \ngrants on the grounds that “[t]he grant[s were] . . . inconsistent with, and no longer effectuate[d], \nDepartment priorities.”  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-10548, 2025 WL 760825, \nat *3 (D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  Plaintiffs sought an injunction preventing the Department of \nEducation from implementing the grant terminations, asserting that the terminations were \narbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with governing law proscribing methods by which \nagencies can terminate grants.  Id. at *2.  \nThe district court granted the application for a temporary restraining order, finding that \nthe terminations were arbitrary and capricious under the APA.  California v. U.S. Dep’t of Educ.,  \n2025 WL 760825, at *3.  In so doing, the district court, accepting NIH’s position, held that the \naction did not fall within the Court of Federal Claims’ jurisdiction under the Tucker Act because \n“the ‘essence’ of the action was not contractual in nature since the source of the plaintiffs’ rights \nwas in federal statute and regulations and because the relief was injunctive in nature.”  Id. at *1 \n(quoting NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *8).  Defendants moved for a stay pending appeal, and the \nFirst Circuit denied the stay and affirmed the district court on the jurisdictional issue, reasoning \nthat “if the Department breached any contract, it did so by violating the APA.  And if the \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 13 of 49\nDepartment did not violate the APA, then it breached no contract.”  California v. U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc., 132 F.4th 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2025).   \nDefendants in California then petitioned the Supreme Court for emergency relief.  A per \ncurium panel of the court granted the stay, finding that “the District Court’s ‘basis for issuing the \norder [is] strongly challenged,’ as the Government is likely to succeed in showing the District \nCourt lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA.”  California, 145 S. Ct. \nat 968 (alteration in original) (quoting Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87 (1974)).  The \nanalysis that followed was brief, providing in full: \nThe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply “if any other statute that \ngrants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 702. Nor does the waiver apply to claims seeking “money damages.”  Ibid.  \nTrue, a district court’s jurisdiction “is not barred by the possibility” that an order \nsetting aside an agency's action may result in the disbursement of funds.  Bowen v. \nMassachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988).  But, \nas we have recognized, the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to \norders “to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money” along the lines of what \nthe District Court ordered here.  Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, \n534 U.S. 204, 212, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002).  Instead, the Tucker Act \ngrants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on “any express or \nimplied contract with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). \n \nId.  Defendants in this action contend that this language from California is dispositive as to this \nCourt’s jurisdiction, contending it “addressed [the jurisdictional] issue in the same context in \nwhich Plaintiffs’ claims arise, i.e., grant awards” and thus forecloses “Plaintiffs[’] attempt to \nshoehorn their claims into the APA by styling their complaint as one for injunctive relief .”  \n[ECF No. 47 at 7–8].   \nAlthough mindful of the fact that “courts are bound by the Supreme Court’s considered \ndicta almost as firmly as by the Court’s outright holdings,” McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 \nF.2d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 1991), this Court is hesitant to conclude that California requires it to cede \njurisdiction to the Federal Court of Claims simply because both cases involve federal grant \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 14 of 49\nfunding and bear a superficial resemblance to one another.  It is true that an injunction in each \naction would have the effect of requiring the government to continue to pay money pursuant to \ncertain grant agreements.  That said, on a closer look, the two actions are far from identical \ntwins.  For example, contrary to the facts here, the California plaintiffs asserted violations of \ngoverning law rooted in regulations about terminating rather than awarding grants.  Thus, the \n“source of the right[]” to the grant was, in California, arguably, the grant agreements, and the \nrelief contemplated was the money owed under those grants, making the case more akin to a \ncontract action.  Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-cv-1015, 2025 WL 1166400, at *9 (D.D.C. Apr. \n22, 2025) (quoting Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. \nCir. 2022).  Additionally, the plaintiffs in California sued to enjoin terminations on already \nawarded grants; they did not sue to enjoin any action as to future, unawarded grants.   \nBy contrast to the paucity of relevant regulations in California, as discussed supra, a vast \nregulatory structure protects Plaintiffs’ right to rely on negotiated indirect cost rates with regards \nto current and future grants.  Although the negotiated rates are ultimately incorporated into \nwritten agreements and awards, and an injunction here may impact payments on current and \nfuture grants, Plaintiffs are not suing to enforce those rates or to collect those costs.  Rather, \nPlaintiffs are seeking to protect their right to maintain the memorialized rates absent the DOE \nmeeting the regulatory requirement for a deviation (as to current awards) and to be able to \nnegotiate those rates, institution by institution, based on reimbursable costs and subsequent \naudits (as to future awards), both of which are rights provided by the regulations, not the \nNICRAs themselves, and that are alleged to have been usurped by the Rate Cap Policy.  The \nterms and conditions of each individual NICRA (or the terms of any existing grants) are not at \nissue, as the DOE’s Rate Cap Policy “was not based on individualized assessments of any \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 15 of 49\nparticular grant terms or conditions or agreements.”  New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-00039, \n2025 WL 1098966, at *2 (D.R.I. Apr. 14, 2025).  Rather, the issue is whether the “broad, \ncategorical” policy itself runs afoul of the APA, warranting forward-looking injunctive relief.  Id.  \nIt may well be that these distinctions would not differentiate this case from California in \nthe eyes of the Supreme Court, but this Court cannot read those tea leaves.  The brief analysis \nwithin the California stay order lacks guideposts as to which facts the Supreme Court viewed as \ndistinguishing that case from the longstanding precedent it cited for the proposition that “a \ndistrict court’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an \nagency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds.”  California, 145 S. Ct. at 968 (citing \nBowen, 487 U.S. at 910); see also Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. U.S. Dep’t of \nAgric., No. 25-cv-00097, 2025 WL 1116157, at *14 (D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (“The Supreme \nCourt’s brief treatment of Bowen and Great-West Life in California and the cursory mention of \npotential jurisdictional issues do not appear to settle all jurisdictional issues here, despite the \nGovernment’s arguments to the contrary.”).  In light of well-settled precedent and practice, as \nwell as the many facts that distinguish this case from California, the Court declines, on this \nrecord, to adopt a categorical rule that would see all federal grant funding disputes go to the \nCourt of Claims.  Rather, this Court returns to first principles and asks “[w]hether [the \nPlaintiffs’] claim is ‘at its essence’ contractual,” which “‘depends both on the source of the rights \nupon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought (or appropriate),’” \nand determines that it is not.  Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106 (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 \nF.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).   \nThe Court agrees with the well-reasoned opinion of a sister session of this court in NIH \nand, for the reasons articulated supra, finds that “the gravamen of Plaintiffs’ Complaint[] does \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 16 of 49\nnot turn on terms of a contract between the parties[, but rather] on federal statute and regulations \nput in place by Congress and [DOE].”  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *6.  “While it is true that the \nNotice of Award operates as a contract, the claims in this case turn on how the regulations \ngovern the provision of these awards”—a fact which “is further underscored by the [Rate Cap \nPolicy’s] impact not just on current grants, but future ones as well.”  Id.  Moreover “Plaintiffs do \nnot bring claims for past pecuniary harms.  Rather, like the petitioners in Bowen, their claims are \nto preserve their ongoing and prospective agreements with” the DOE and, as discussed further \ninfra, to avoid various irreparable harms unrelated to any monetary relief.  Id. at *7.  \nFor the forgoing reasons, the Court finds it has jurisdiction pursuant to the APA.1  \nIII.  STANDING \nThe Constitution gives the judiciary power to hear only “Cases” and “Controversies.” \nU.S. Const. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  The Supreme Court has interpreted this requirement to mean that \ncourts may decide only “cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and \nresolved by, the judicial process.”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 \n(1998).  A plaintiff’s standing to sue is “part of the common understanding of what it takes to \nmake a justiciable case.”  Id.  Therefore, “the absence of standing sounds the death knell for a \ncase.”  Microsystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, 226 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2000). \nThe standing determination is “claim-specific,” meaning that an individual plaintiff “must have \nstanding to bring each and every claim that [he or] she asserts.”  Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d \n64, 71 (1st Cir. 2012). \n \n \n1 For the reasons the Court determines this is not an action where jurisdiction lies with the \nFederal Court of Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act, the Court also disagrees with Defendants’ \ncontention that this is an action seeking to compel the government to specifically perform a \ncontract.  [ECF No. 47 at 10–11].   \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 17 of 49\nArticle III standing requires that three conditions be satisfied.  “First and foremost, there \nmust be alleged (and ultimately proved) an ‘injury in fact.’”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103 (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)).  This injury “must be concrete in both a \nqualitative and temporal sense,” “distinct and palpable” as opposed to “abstract,” and “actual or \nimminent” as opposed to “conjectural or hypothetical.”  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155 (internal \nquotations and citations omitted).  Second, standing requires causation, defined as a “fairly \ntraceable connection between the plaintiff's injury and the complained-of conduct of the \ndefendant.”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103.  Finally, standing requires “redressability—a likelihood \nthat the requested relief will redress the alleged injury.”  Id. \n“[A]n association may have standing solely as the representative of its members even in \nthe absence of injury to itself, in certain circumstances.”  Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., \nInc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 799 F.2d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 \nU.S. 490, 511 (1975)).  Specifically, “an association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its \nmembers when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the \ninterests it seeks to protect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”   \nHunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  The first two Hunt \nprongs are constitutional, and the third is prudential.  United Food and Commercial Workers \nUnion Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555–57 (1996).  Only one member of an \norganization need have individual standing in order for that organization to satisfy the first Hunt \nfactor.  See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n of P.R., 906 F.2d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 1990) \n(“[T]he Supreme Court has never required that every member of an association have standing \nbefore it can sue on behalf of its members. ‘The association must allege that its members, or any \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 18 of 49\none of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of \nthe sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.’” \n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at 511)). \nDefendants contest only the third Hunt prong.  Specifically, they contend that, “[a]s \nshown by the sheer number of declarations submitted by the Organizational Plaintiffs’ member \ninstitutions in an attempt to show irreparable harm, Plaintiffs fail the third requirement:  \nIndividual members must participate to show entitlement to injunctive relief—particularly if this \nCourt follows the proper practice of limiting any injunction to those institutions that have shown \nthat the Policy Flash will cause them irreparable harm.”  [ECF No. 47 at 17].  Plaintiffs respond \nthat “if that were the law, no associational plaintiff would ever have standing.  In fact, injunctive \nsuits like this one are bread-and-butter association standing cases.”  [ECF No. 53 at 13].  \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs’ argument is ultimately more availing.  The injunctive and \ndeclaratory relief Plaintiffs request need not be tailored to or require any individualized proof \nfrom any particular member.  See Camel Hair, 799 F.2d at 12 (“Actions for declaratory, \ninjunctive and other forms of prospective relief have generally been held particularly suited to \ngroup representation.”); see also Playboy Enters., 906 F.2d at 35 (“[J]ust because a claim may \nrequire proof specific to individual members of an association does not mean the members are \nrequired to participate as parties in the lawsuit.” (emphasis omitted)).  “The nub of the \n[P]laintiff[s’] claim,” that the Rate Cap Policy violates the APA, depends on the text of that \npolicy and the underlying regulatory structure, “not on evidence that differs from member to \nmember.”  Camel Hair, 799 F.2d at 12.  “In addition, the relief sought, that the [Rate Cap Policy] \nbe enjoined, will affect all members in the same way . . . [a]nd [D]efendants have adduced no \nreason to suggest that the [Organizational Plaintiffs] cannot adequately represent [their] \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 19 of 49\nmembers’ interests.”  Id.  As Defendants do not challenge the other Hunt factors, and because the \nCourt finds that, in any event, they are satisfied, the Organizational Plaintiffs have standing. \nIV.  PRELIMINARY INJUCTION LEGAL STANDARD \nWhen deciding whether to grant a motion for preliminary injunction, courts must \nconsider four factors: “(i) the movant’s likelihood of success on the merits of its claims; (ii) \nwhether and to what extent the movant will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is withheld; \n(iii) the balance of hardships as between the parties; and (iv) the effect, if any, that an injunction \n(or the withholding of one) may have on the public interest.”  Corp. Techs., Inc. v. Harnett, 731 \nF.3d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 2013).  The First Circuit has held that these four factors “are not entitled to \nequal weight in the decisional calculus.”  Id.  Rather, the movant’s likelihood of success on the \nmerits “is the main bearing wall of the four-factor framework.”  Id. at 10 (citation omitted).  \n“[P]roving likelihood of success on the merits is the ‘sine qua non’ of a preliminary injunction.”  \nArborjet, Inc. v. Rainbow Treecare Sci. Advancements, Inc., 794 F.3d 168, 173 (1st Cir. 2015) \n(quoting New Comm Wireless Servs., Inc. v. SprintCom, Inc., 287 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002)). \nTherefore, “[i]f the moving party cannot demonstrate that [they are] likely to succeed in [their] \nquest, the remaining factors become matters of idle curiosity.”  Id. (quoting New Comm \nWireless Servs., 287 F.3d at 9).  Likewise, the balance of hardships and public interest factors \n“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009).  As the moving party, Plaintiffs bear the burden of satisfying each of these four elements.  \nSee Nieves-Marquez v. Puerto Rico, 353 F.3d 108, 120 (1st Cir. 2003). \nPreliminary injunctions function to “preserve the relative positions of the parties until a \ntrial on the merits can be held.”  Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981).  As a \nresult, “findings of fact and conclusions of law made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 20 of 49\nare not binding at trial on the merits.”  Id. (citing Indus. Bank of Wash. v. Tobriner, 405 F.2d \n1321, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1968)).  The granting of a preliminary injunction is “an ‘extraordinary and \ndrastic remedy’ that ‘is never awarded as of right.’”  Voice of the Arab World, Inc. v. MDTV \nMed. News Now, Inc., 645 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2011) (quoting Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, \n689–90 (2008)). \nV.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits  \n  Plaintiffs contend that Defendants committed substantive violations of the APA by taking \nagency action that is (1) not in accordance with the governing law, (2) arbitrary and capricious, \nand (3) impermissibly retroactive.  \n  Under the APA, a reviewing court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action, \nfindings, and conclusions found to be . . . arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”  5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  As a general matter, judicial \nreview of an APA claim is “narrow” as the “APA standard affords great deference to \nagency decisionmaking . . . because the [agency’s] action is presumed valid.”  Associated \nFisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997). \n1.  Final Agency Action \nAs discussed infra, the APA entitles any person “suffering legal wrong because of agency \naction, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action” to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 702. \nSuch review, however, is limited to final agency actions unless otherwise specified by statute.  \nSee id. § 704.  \nAn agency action is final if two conditions are met: first, the action must “mark the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and not be “of a merely tentative or \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 21 of 49\ninterlocutory nature,” and, second, it must be “one by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Harper v. Werfel, 118 F.4th 100, 117 \n(1st Cir. 2024) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 \n(1997)).  “The core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process, \nand whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.”  Brnovich v. \nBiden, 630 F. Supp. 3d 1157, 1171 (D. Ariz. 2022) (quoting Or. Nat. Desert Ass’n v. U.S. Forest \nServ., 465 F.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006)). \nDefendants contend that the Rate Cap Policy “is not a final agency action subject to \njudicial review under the APA because it does not have a legal effect or consequence.”  [ECF \nNo. 47 at 12].  Rather, they contend that “[i]t is a mechanism for communicating financial \nassistance-related information [which] does not itself have the force or effect of law or direct any \nimpact on any existing grant award.”  [Id.].  They further assert that the Rate Cap Policy itself \n“removes any doubt on this score:  It closes by promising that ‘[a]dditional information is \nforthcoming’—making clear that the formal policy marking the end of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process and carrying concrete consequences has not yet arrived.”  [Id. (alteration \nin original) (quoting Rate Cap Policy)].  \nPlaintiffs counter that, as to the first Bennett factor, the text of the Rate Cap Policy “could \nnot be clearer:  It says ‘[f]or the reasons set forth [here], hereinafter, [DOE] will no longer use \nthe negotiated indirect cost rate,’” then establishes a standardized 15 percent rate, and says that \nthe accompanying memorandum “sets forth the Department’s policies, procedures, and general \ndecision-making criteria” regarding the change.  [ECF No. 53 at 10].  To the extent it promises \nthat “additional information is forthcoming,” Plaintiffs contend that this simply “promises more \ninformation about a decision already made.”  [Id. at 10].   \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 22 of 49\nAs to the second prong, Plaintiffs assert that “the Policy’s consequences are, in fact, quite \nclear,” as evidenced by “the conditional termination letters DOE rushed out ahead of this Court’s \nTRO ruling” that state that “they were issued ‘pursuant to the [Rate Cap] Policy,’” [id. at 11 \n(quoting ECF No. 33-1 at 8, 10)], as well as the DOE email to Arizona State University \ncommunicating that “[d]ue to the Policy Flash from DOE, . . . currently invoices from IHEs are \nnot being processed,”  [id. (emphasis omitted) (quoting ECF No. 53-1)].   \nFor the purposes of a preliminary injunction, the Court is satisfied that the Rate Cap \nPolicy constitutes final agency action.  On the first Bennet prong, the Rate Cap Policy \nunambiguously states that, for the reasons set forth therein, the DOE “will no longer use the \nnegotiated indirect cost rate for grants awarded to IHEs” and will instead use “a standardized 15 \npercent indirect cost rate for all grant awards to IHEs.”  [ECF No. 2 at 3].  This language is not \n“merely tentative or interlocutory” in nature,  Harper, 118 F.4th at 116; rather, it is “mandatory,” \nUnion of Concerned Scientists v. Wheeler, 377 F. Supp. 3d 34, 42 (D. Mass. 2019), aff’d in part, \nrev’d in part and remanded, 954 F.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2020), in that it unequivocally states that the \nDOE has made a decision and is moving forward with it.  Even accepting that IHEs will “receive \nseparate notice and guidance,” [ECF No. 2 at 3], there is no suggestion in the text that any such \nsubsequent notice would backtrack on, rather than simply clarify or provide further instructions \nregarding, the Rate Cap Policy.   \nWith regard to the legal effect, again, the plain text of the Rate Cap Policy communicates \nthat consequences are forthcoming in short order.  Specifically, as to current awards, the Rate \nCap Policy establishes that the DOE is “undertaking action to terminate all grant awards to IHEs \nthat do not conform with [the update],” [ECF No. 2 at 3], and, as to future awards, it similarly \ndictates that “[a]ll future [DOE] grant awards to IHEs will default to this 15 percent indirect cost \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 23 of 49\nrate,” [id.].  Moreover, if this announcement left any room for doubt as to whether Plaintiffs \nwould experience any legal effect, the DOE’s conduct has removed any such doubt, as it has \nbegun to send conditional termination letters to IHEs, [ECF No. 33-1], as well as (mistakenly, \ngiven the existence of the TRO at the time of the email) deny invoices based on that Rate Cap \nPolicy, [ECF No. 53-1].  As such, this Court is satisfied that the decision-making process is \ncomplete, the policy is set, and the result of that process has already or will soon directly affect \nthe parties.  Brnovich, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 1171.2  \n2.  Arbitrary and Capricious  \n“The task of a court reviewing agency action under the APA’s ‘arbitrary and capricious’ \nstandard is to determine whether the agency has examined the pertinent evidence, considered the \nrelevant factors, and ‘articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.’”  Penobscot Air Servs., Ltd. v. FAA, \n164 F.3d 713, 719 (1st Cir. 1999) (second-level internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983)).  “While \n \n \n2 Defendants raise a separate challenge regarding the Rate Cap Policy’s reviewability under the \nAPA, contending that the “APA precludes judicial review because the DOE’s grant funding \ndecisions are ‘committed to agency discretion by law.’”  [ECF No. 47 at 14–16 (quoting 5 \nU.S.C. § 701(a)(2))].  The Court disagrees.  Even assuming that this type of grant funding would \nbe considered an “administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency \ndiscretion,” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993), and the Court is not convinced that it is, \nthe exception is typically limited to those “rare circumstances” where “no meaningful standard” \nexists by which a reviewing judge could cabin that agency discretion, Dep’t of Com. v. New \nYork, 588 U.S. 752, 772 (2019).  Here, “applicable regulations cabin the Department’s discretion \nas to when it can” deviate from negotiated indirect costs, which “create meaningful standards by \nwhich to judge the agency’s action.”  California, 132 F.4th at 97 (cleaned up); see Pol’y & Rsch., \nLLC v. HHS, 313 F. Supp. 3d 62, 75–78 (D.D.C. 2018) (K.B. Jackson, J.) (holding that agency’s \notherwise-presumptively unreviewable decision to halt funding to an agency program was \nreviewable under the APA because applicable regulations cabined its termination authority).  \n \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 24 of 49\nthis is a highly deferential standard of review, it is not a rubber stamp.”  Id. at 720 (quoting \nDubois v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1285 (1st Cir. 1996)).  The Court “may not \nsupply a reasoned basis for the agency’s action that the agency itself has not given.”  Id. (quoting \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43). \nIn the context of a policy change, “the requirement that an agency provide a reasoned \nexplanation for its action would ordinarily demand that it display awareness that it is changing \nposition.”  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (emphasis omitted).   \n“An agency may not, for example, depart from a prior policy sub silentio or simply disregard \nrules that are still on the books.”  Id. (citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 696 (1974)).  \nThat said, agencies are “free to change their existing policies as long as they provide a reasoned \nexplanation for the change.”  Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016) \n(citations omitted).  The agency must further “show that there are good reasons for the new \npolicy,” although it need not demonstrate that “the reasons for the new policy are better than the \nreasons for the old one.”  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515 (emphasis omitted).  “[I]t \nsuffices that the new policy is permissible under the statute, that there are good reasons for it, \nand that the agency believes it to be better, which the conscious change of course adequately \nindicates.”  Id. (emphasis omitted).  \nThat said, a “more detailed justification” may be required when 1) the agency’s new \nposition “rests upon factual findings that contradict those which underlay [the] prior” position or \n2) when the agency’s prior position “has engendered serious reliance interests.”  Fox Television \nStations, 556 U.S. at 515; see NLRB v. Lily Transp. Corp., 853 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2017) \n(Souter, J.) (“[A]n about-face . . . owing to facts changed from those underlying the prior view \nrequires that the new facts be addressed explicitly by reasoned explanation for the change of \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 25 of 49\ndirection.”).  Further, “when an agency rescinds a prior [position,] its reasoned analysis must \nconsider the ‘alternative[s]’ that are ‘within the ambit of the existing [position].’”  DHS v. \nRegents of the Univ. of Cal.,140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913 (2020) (second alteration in original) (quoting \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 51). \nRegardless of whether the DOE was required to put forth a “more detailed justification” \nfor the Rate Cap Policy, the Court cannot discern any “reasoned explanation” for the change.  \nThe whole of the purported explanation seems to be:  \nWhile the Department is cognizant that many grant recipients use indirect cost \npayments to effectuate research funded by the Department’s grant awards, these \npayments are not for the Department’s direct research funding. See 89 Fed. Reg. \n30046–30093. As these funds are entrusted to the Department by the American \npeople, the Department must ensure it is putting them to appropriate use on grant \nprograms.  To  improve  efficiency  and  curtail  costs  where  appropriate,  the \nDepartment seeks to better balance the financial needs of grant recipients with the \nDepartment’s obligation to responsibly manage federal funds. \n \n[ECF No. 2 at 2]; see also [ECF No. 47 at 25–26 (discussing justifications within the Rate Cap \nPolicy)].  To be sure, this excerpt articulates very reasonable agency goals, namely, to allocate \n“funds . . . entrusted to [DOE] by the American people . . . to appropriate use on grant programs” \nand [t]o “improve efficiency and curtail costs where appropriate.”  [ECF No. 2 at 2].  Statements \nof aspirational goals, however, are not the same as reasoned explanations for why an action is \nchosen or how the chosen action will effectuate the stated goals.  \nHere, the Rate Cap Policy falls short.  It provides no reasoned explanation for how or \nwhy the DOE concluded that indirect cost rates exceeding 15 percent do not constitute an \nappropriate or efficient use of DOE funds, nor does it explain how limiting funding for indirect \ncosts would lead to that money being put to more appropriate and efficient uses.  For instance, \nthe Rate Cap Policy does not, as Defendants contend, explain that the money spent on indirect \ncosts will be redirected to direct costs; it simply says that indirect costs are not direct.  [ECF No. \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 26 of 49\n2 at 2].  That said, even if the DOE had stated an intent to reinvest indirect costs in direct \nresearch funding, that explanation would not be particularly well-reasoned, given the amount of \nsupport in the record for the notion that Plaintiffs would not be able to accept further direct \nresearch funding (or, indeed, even utilize their current direct research funding) absent an indirect \ncost rate that continues to approximate actual expenditures.  See, e.g., [ECF No. 2-4 at ¶ 18 \n(“[W]ithout continuing indirect cost reimbursement at Cornell’s negotiated rates, Cornell would \nno longer be able to carry out all of the sponsored activities and properly maintain the facilities \nand equipment currently in use, jeopardizing the current and future conduct of the DOE-\nsupported projects.”)].  Nor does the Rate Cap Policy provide any rationale for concluding that \nsubjecting all IHEs to the 15 percent de minimis rate, typically reserved for IHEs without \nnegotiated rates, is more efficient or appropriate than the current negotiation and audit system.  \nUniformity is not necessarily efficient or appropriate, particularly when the record is clear that \nIHEs constitute a sizeable portion of the DOE’s budget across distinct institutions, each with \nunique awards governed by individualized indirect cost rates.  See, e.g., [ECF No. 2-1 ¶ 4 \n(“Together, [AAU member universities] receive a total of roughly $1.8 billion in DOE research \nand development expenditures . . . To give a sense of scale: DOE’s research and development \n(‘R&D’) expenditures nationwide total approximately $2.7 billion, meaning that funding to \nAAU’s members makes up about two-thirds of all such expenditures.”)]; [ECF No. 2-5 ¶¶ 4, 12 \n(University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s DOE portfolio includes 123 active awards at a \n58.6% indirect cost rate)]; [ECF No. [ECF No. 2-18 ¶¶ 3, 11 (University of Nevada, Reno’s \nDOE portfolio includes 48 active awards at a 47% indirect cost rate); [ECF No. 2-19 ¶ 4 (Tufts \nDOE portfolio has 29 active awards at a 58% indirect cost rate)].   \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 27 of 49\n These examples, and there are others, illustrate the overarching problem:  Although the \nDOE need not demonstrate that “the reasons for the new policy are better than the reasons for the \nold one,”  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515 (emphasis omitted), it must, at base, offer \n“good reasons for the new policy,”  Encino, 579 U.S. at 223 (quoting Fox Television Stations, \n556 U.S. at 515), not the mere conclusion that the Rate Cap Policy is more efficient or \nappropriate, Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1350 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“At bottom, an \nagency must explain ‘why it chose to do what it did.’” (quoting Tourus Records, Inc. v. DEA, \n259 F.3d 731, 737 (D.C. Cir. 2001)).  Because the Rate Cap Policy does not offer more than \nconclusory policy goals, the Court need go no further:  Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood \nof success in demonstrating that the Rate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious and therefore \nruns afoul of the APA.  See Encino, 579 U.S. at 224 (“Whatever potential reasons the \nDepartment might have given, the agency in fact gave almost no reasons at all.”).  \n  That said, the Court would be remiss if it did not note that the Rate Cap Policy’s lack of \nreasoned explanation is particularly troubling in light “of decades of industry reliance on \n[DOE’s] prior policy” of accepting individually negotiated indirect cost rates for IHEs.  Encino, \n579 U.S. at 222 (noting that “[a] summary discussion may suffice in other circumstances, but \nhere—in particular because of decades of industry reliance on the Department’s prior policy—\nthe explanation fell short of the agency’s duty to explain why it deemed it necessary to overrule \nits previous position”).  The well-established, decades-long relationship between IHEs and the \nDOE prior to the Rate Cap Policy afforded Plaintiffs several reasonable assumptions about the \nDOE’s position on indirect costs, all of which were consistent with DOE goals of advancing \nscience through cutting edge research in partnership with America’s foremost research \ninstitutions, including that: 1) “negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect (F&A) costs for a \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 28 of 49\nperiod of two to four years should be the norm,” 2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. III(C)(4); 2) the \nnegotiated indirect cost rate, when finalized with Plaintiffs’ cognizant agency, would be based on \n“an informed judgment as to the probable level of indirect (F&A) costs during the ensuing \naccounting periods,” id.; 3) that rate would then, as it “must[,] be accepted by all Federal \nagencies,” 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1); and, 4) the agreed-upon rate could only be changed after the \nDOE met certain regulatory requirements, id. § 200.414(c)(1)–(4).  Pursuant to these reasonable \nexpectations, Plaintiffs have, among other things, formulated their overall operating budgets; \nstaffed departments; accepted undergraduate students, graduate, and post-doctoral candidates; \nand built and improved infrastructure to support both current and future research.  See, e.g., \n[ECF No. 2-7 ¶ 14 (“The University of Michigan has for decades relied on the payment of \nindirect costs.  And until now, we have been able to rely on the well-established process for \nnegotiating indirect cost rates with the government to inform our budgeting and planning.  \nOperating budgets rely on an estimate of both direct and indirect sponsored funding to plan for \nannual staffing needs (e.g., post-docs, PhD students, and other research staff), infrastructure \nsupport (e.g., IT networks, regulatory compliance, and grant management support), and facility \nand equipment purchases.  And in some cases, the University of Michigan has long-term \nobligations—for example, long-term equipment maintenance contracts and service agreements, \nspecialized technical staff positions in facilities supporting DOE research, debt service on \nresearch infrastructure investments and laboratory renovations; and it relies on budgeted grant \nfunding, including associated indirect cost recovery, to fulfill these commitments.”)]; see also \n[ECF Nos. 2-5 ¶ 15; 2-8 ¶ 15; 2-9 ¶ 28; 2-10 ¶ 14; 2-11 ¶ 15; 2-12 ¶ 16; 2-13 ¶ 13; 2-16 ¶ 14; 2-\n18 ¶ 15]. \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 29 of 49\nIn the face of this longstanding course of conduct and the reliance it has engendered, the \nRate Policy Flash offers only that “the Department is cognizant that many grant recipients use \nindirect cost payments to effectuate research funded by the Department’s grant awards.”  [ECF \nNo. 2 at 2].  It then notes that, despite this fact, “these payments are not for the Department’s \ndirect research funding.”  [Id.]  This is both obvious and ultimately unhelpful.  The distinction \nbetween direct and indirect costs has been recognized and embedded in the regulatory structure \nsince OMB undertook to fund research at IHEs.  The Rate Cap Policy wholly disregards the prior \nmutually understood reality that these indirect cost payments, while perhaps not sufficient for \ndirect research to occur, are necessary to that research.  They are, in fact, a crucial part of the \nfunding structure which must be managed and protected to ensure our nation’s ability to advance \nscientific innovation to meet very real energy, environmental, and nuclear challenges.  Missing \nfrom the Rate Cap Policy’s purported recognition of the indisputable reliance interest is a \n“reasoned explanation . . . for disregarding [that understanding, which was] engendered by the \nprior policy,” and, notably, any acknowledgement of the potential consequences of the policy \nchange.   Encino, 579 U.S. at 222 (quoting Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 515).  As such, \nthe Rate Cap Policy “f[alls] short of [DOE’s] duty to explain why it deemed it necessary to \noverrule its previous position,” id., and Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in establishing that the \nRate Cap Policy is arbitrary and capricious for this reason as well. \n3.  2 C.F.R. § 200.414  \nAs discussed supra, one of the key regulatory provisions governing indirect cost rates is 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.414.  In particular, Section (c), entitled “Federal Agency Acceptance of Negotiated \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 30 of 49\nIndirect Cost Rates,” proscribes the process by which OMB, and by extension DOE, can \n“deviate” from previously negotiated indirect cost funding rates.3  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c).  \nPlaintiffs contend that the Rate Cap Policy violates the requirements for utilizing an \nindirect cost rate different from the rate memorialized in the NICRA.  [ECF No. 19 at 31–34].  In \nparticular, they contend that the requirements of Section (c), taken together, “at most authorize \nthe agencies to announce policies and procedure governing subsequent decisions to make \nindividualized deviations from the baseline negotiated rate.  They do not license agencies to, by \nfiat, wipe out all negotiated rates for institutions of higher education.”  [Id. at 32].  They urge the \nCourt to read Section (c) as mandating a sequential process by which “agencies ‘must’ accept[] \nnegotiated rates unless [the] agency publicizes ‘policies, procedures and general decision-making \ncriteria’ and then ‘follow[s]’ them “to seek and justify deviations from negotiated rates.”  [ECF \nNo. 53 at 16 (emphasis added)].  They contend that, pursuant to this sequencing, the Rate Cap \nPolicy fails because “[w]hile the Rate Cap Policy insists that it ‘sets forth [DOE’s] policies, \n \n \n3 For ease of reference, Section (c) provides:  \n(1) Negotiated indirect cost rates must be accepted by all Federal agencies.  A Federal \nagency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for either a class of Federal \nawards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or \nwhen approved by the awarding Federal agency in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of \nthis section. \n(2) The Federal agency must notify OMB of any approved deviations.  The recipient or \nsubrecipient may notify OMB of any disputes with Federal agencies regarding the \napplication of a federally negotiated indirect cost rate. \n(3) The Federal agency must implement, and make publicly available, the policies, \nprocedures and general decision-making criteria that their programs will follow to seek \nand justify deviations from negotiated rates. \n(4) The Federal agency must include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies \nrelating to indirect cost rate reimbursement or cost share as approved under paragraph (e).  \nAs appropriate, the Federal agency should incorporate discussion of these policies into its \noutreach activities with applicants before posting a notice of funding opportunity.  See § \n200.204. \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 31 of 49\nprocedures, and general-decision making criteria,’ it does no such thing [because] a categorical \ndictate of a 15% rate is not a ‘procedure’ and does not set forth ‘general decision-making \ncriteria’ under the plain meaning of those terms.”  [ECF No. 19 at 32].   \nDefendants counter that “Plaintiffs improperly seek to read into Subsection (c)(3) a \nrequirement that any ‘deviation’ from negotiated indirect cost rates occur on a case-by-case \nbasis,” which is not supported by Subsection (c)(1) as it “specifically authorizes the use of [a] \nnon-negotiated rate for a ‘class of Federal awards,’ without limiting the size of that class.”  [ECF \nNo. 47 at 19].  They further assert that to the extent Plaintiffs suggest that Subsection (c)(3) \nrequires “some temporal distance between announcement of new ‘policies, procedures, and \ngeneral decision making criteria’ and actual determination of a non-negotiated rate,” that will \noccur here through “[a]pplication of the non-negotiated rates to new grant awards, and (in this \ncase) future action to terminate existing grant awards.”  [Id. at 20–21].  Defendants’ position is \nthat, in issuing the Rate Cap Policy, “DOE publicized the policy and decision-making criteria \nthat it may later use in seeking and justifying deviations from negotiated rates” and “announced \nthe procedure it would use for applying the new policy—application of a 15% rate for the IHEs.”  \n[Id. at 18–19].  As such, Defendants contend that the Rate Cap Policy “rests on a straightforward \napplication of Section 200.414(c)(3), and therefore satisfies Section 200.414(c)(1).”  [Id. at 19]. \n  Even assuming that all awards to all IHE’s can properly be construed as a “class of \nFederal awards” under Section (c)(1) such that a rate change is permissible, 4 the Court disagrees \n \n \n4 Given the purported size of this “class,” this is far from clear to the Court.  As noted elsewhere, \na “class of federal awards” is defined as “a group of Federal awards either awarded under a \nspecific program or group of programs or to a specific type of recipient or group of recipients to \nwhich specific provisions or exceptions may apply.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.1.  Although Defendants’ \nreading of that definition as permitting the DOE to classify all IHEs as a “type of recipient” is \n \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 32 of 49\nwith Defendants’ contention that the Rate Cap Policy clears Section (c)(1) by virtue of its \n(purported) compliance with Section (c)(3).  By its plain terms, Section (c)(1) requires more than \njust compliance with Section (c)(3):  It requires the awarding agency to “approve[]” the change.  \n2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(1).  The Federal Register notice discussing 2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c) is \ninstructive as to what this approval requires, explaining that the text of Section (c) contemplates \n“approval of the Federal awarding agency head . . . based on documented justification.”  \nUniform Administrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal \nAwards, 78 Fed. Reg. 78,590, 78,600 (Dec. 26, 2013).  It continues on to discuss that it was \nimportant to the provision’s drafters that a well-reasoned approval underlie Section (c)(1), \nexplaining that “[s]ome commenters recommended that for even greater consistency decisions \nabout the use of rates be subject to OMB approval rather than Federal agency approval,” but this \nproposal was ultimately rejected on the basis “that the conditions set by OMB for these \ndeterminations are stringent enough to ensure that they do not occur without strong justification.”  \nId. (emphasis added).  Thus, although the term “documented justification” does not appear in \nSection (c)(1),5 the provision clearly contemplates that agency approval of a departure from a \n \n \nnot inherently antithetical to the English language, the Court is skeptical that such a broad-based \nclassification is what the regulations intended.  IHEs, as discussed elsewhere in this order, \naccount for a substantial percentage of the DOE’s research and development budget, and they are \nawarded hundreds (if not thousands) of individualized grants to further distinct research goals.  \nTo permit an exception to the negotiated indirect cost rates for all these institutions and all their \ngrant awards in the same missive strikes this Court as lacking the specificity that the definition \ncontemplates.   \n5 The term “documented justification” does appear in the substantially similar regulations \ngoverning permissible exceptions to NIH indirect cost rates.  See 45 C.F.R. § 75.414(c)(1) (“An \nHHS awarding agency may use a rate different from the negotiated rate for a class of Federal \nawards or a single Federal award only when required by Federal statute or regulation, or when \napproved by a Federal awarding agency head or delegate based on documented justification as \ndescribed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section.”) (emphasis added).  \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 33 of 49\nnegotiated rate must be based on the careful consideration of a strong underlying rationale that \nwarrants the change.  \n  On the present record, there is nothing to indicate that the DOE approved the change to \nIHE indirect cost rates based on a “strong” or “documented” justification.  As discussed supra, \nthe Rate Cap Policy, even read generously, offers very little by way of explanation or \njustification for the decision to so suddenly and drastically limit reimbursement for indirect costs.  \nThe Court is mindful that the DOE is privy to information that could, in theory, have supported \nthe policy change.  If such data exists, however, it was not made public or otherwise articulated, \nand Plaintiffs are, at this stage, more likely than not to prevail on their argument that the Rate \nCap Policy did not receive the “approv[al]” contemplated by Section (c)(1).  Moreover, Plaintiffs \nare more likely than not to prevail on their argument that the Rate Cap Policy violates Section \n(c)(3) to the extent that the cross-reference to that provision within Section (c)(1) requires the \ndocumented justification underlying agency approval to be made publicly available, which did \nnot happen here.  \n  Additionally, the Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the Rate Cap Policy more likely than \nnot violates Section (c) because the regulation contemplates a step-by-step process for a change \nto a negotiated indirect cost rate, rather than a one fell swoop approach invalidating all pre-\nexisting NICRAs and changing the well-established procedure for all future grants.  The plain \nterms of Section (c)(3), which outline the requirements for deviating from the negotiated indirect \ncost rate pursuant to Section (c)(1), appear to require sequencing.  The provision states that the \nawarding agency seeking a deviation “‘must’—present tense—make available the policies, \nprocedures, and decision-making criteria that [it] ‘will follow’—future tense—to seek and justify \nthe deviation.”  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *10.  To read the provision to permit the DOE to \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 34 of 49\nmake the 15 percent rate cap policy public at the same time as it seeks to enforce it would read \nthese verb tenses, as well as the requirement that the DOE “justify” the deviation, out of the \nprovision.  On this, the Federal Register is again instructive, as it describes Section (c) as \nfunctioning through a sequential process, stating:  \nLanguage in paragraph (c) provides for the consistent application of negotiated \nindirect cost rates, and articulates the conditions under which a Federal awarding \nagency may use a different rate.  These conditions include approval of the Federal \nawarding agency head (as delegated per standard delegations of authority) based \non documented justification, the public availability of established policies for \ndeterminations to use other than negotiated rates, the inclusion of notice of such a \ndecision in the announcement of funding opportunity, as well as in any pre-\nannouncement outreach, and notification to OMB of the decision. \n \n78 Fed. Reg. at 78,600.   \nAdditionally, reading Section (c)(3) to require a sequence of events has the benefit of \naffording meaning to Section (c)(4), which otherwise would seem to have little relevance as it, \nagain on its plain terms, is aimed at providing notice to IHEs of the DOE’s indirect cost \nreimbursement policies before the IHEs even decide to bid on the grant opportunity.  Section \n(c)(4) requires the awarding agency to “include, in the notice of funding opportunity, the policies \nrelating to indirect cost rate reimbursement.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(4).  As discussed supra, \nNOFOs are the precursors to federal awards, which are followed by IHE applications for the \nfunding which must include the IHE’s current NICRA.  The awards, once granted, are required \nby Appendix III to use the NICRAs in effect at the time of the award, unless that award is \nexempt under Section (c)(1).  2 C.F.R. pt. 200, app. III(C)(7) (“Except as provided in paragraph \n(c)(1) of § 200.414, Federal agencies must use the negotiated rates in effect at the time of the \ninitial award throughout the life of the Federal award.” ).  In other words, in the normal course, \nall agencies are subject to the same consistent policy, publicly mandated by Appendix III, which \nrequires that the NOA use the current NICRA, and all IHEs responding to that NOFO would be \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 35 of 49\naware of that policy.  Thus, unless the policies underlying an exception were expected to precede \na deviation to the NICRA, it is difficult to imagine why the drafters of Section (c)(4) would have \nthought it necessary to provide a specific safeguard requiring the awarding agency to include \n“policies relating to indirect cost rate reimbursement” in a NOFO.   \nA concrete hypothetical is instructive.  MIT negotiates its indirect cost rate with DOD, \nspecifically the Office of Naval Research (“ONR”), its cognizant agency.  [ECF No. 2-6 ¶ 10].  \nFor fiscal year 2025, that rate is 59 percent, which would have been memorialized in a NICRA.  \n[Id.]; [ECF No. 60 ¶ 4].  MIT conducts research under 286 direct and indirect funding awards \nfrom the DOE that are currently active for Fiscal Year 2025.  [ECF No. 2-6 ¶ 9].  It would have \nreceived those grants by responding to DOE NOFOs, and each application would have included \nits NICRA.  At the time those NOFOs were posted, the Rate Cap Policy was not in effect and the \nDOE grant award would have provided for a 59 percent indirect cost reimbursement rate to MIT \npursuant to its NICRA with ONR.  On this basis, MIT was granted and accepted awards.  Enter \nthe Rate Cap Policy.  As to the awards that existed at its inception, there was no opportunity for \nthe DOE to include that policy in the NOFO, as that part of the process is already done, and \nSection (c)(4) would be rendered irrelevant.  For future awards, that is awards granted after the \nRate Cap policy became effective, the DOE can include the 15 percent rate cap in the NOFO \nwhen it solicits an application from MIT, but the policy will have preceded the opportunity—\nsupporting Plaintiffs’ contention that Section (c) contemplates a sequence.  \nFurther, a sequenced reading of Section (c) is also consistent with the spirit of Section \n(c)(2), which also appears aimed at building procedural safeguards around indirect cost rate \nchanges.  Specifically, it requires that, following approval of a deviation pursuant to Section \n(c)(1), the awarding agency “must notify OMB” of such deviations such that the “recipient or \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 36 of 49\nsubrecipient may notify OMB of any disputes.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.414(c)(2).  The ability to dispute \nthe approval with OMB would ring hollow were the deviation permitted to take effect \nimmediately.   \nIn sum, the Court is inclined to agree with Plaintiffs’ reading of the regulation as \nmandating a proscribed process for changing procedures about indirect cost reimbursement.  \nDefendants’ reading of the regulations to permit a blanket approach to negotiated indirect cost \nrate deviations would read disorder, rather than order, into this structure by conflating or \notherwise reading out numerous procedural safeguards contemplated by the regulations’ plain \ntext.  McCuin v. Sec’y of Health & Hum. Servs., 817 F.2d 161, 168 (1st Cir. 1987) (“In \ninterpreting statutes and regulations, courts must try to give them a harmonious, comprehensive \nmeaning, giving effect, when possible, to all provisions.”).  In light of the above, the Rate Cap \nPolicy directly conflicts with the plain language of 2 C.F.R. § 200.414, by wholly disregarding \nexisting regulations and the attendant regulatory structure.  Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at \n515 (“An agency may not . . . simply disregard rules that are still on the books.”).  As a result, \nthe Plaintiffs are likely to succeed in claiming that the Rate Cap Policy conflicts with existing \nregulation. \n4.  Impermissible Retroactivity \nPlaintiffs contend that the Rate Cap Policy exceeds the DOE’s statutory authority because \nit is impermissibly retroactive.  [ECF No. 19 at 45–46].  Specifically, they contend that “there is \nno indication whatsoever that DOE has the authority to make the Rate Cap Policy retroactive” \nand that, as to existing grants, “the reduced rate necessarily undermines project budgets that were \npreviously approved and upsets the institutions’ commitments made in reliance upon those \nbudgets.”  [Id. at 46].  Defendants do not argue that the enabling statute authorizes the DOE to \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 37 of 49\nretroactively modify indirect cost rates; rather, they counter that this case “is unlike the cases \ncited by Plaintiffs, in which an agency attempted to claw back money that had already been paid \nout” because the Rate Cap Policy “proposes no such thing; it simply announces an intent to take \nsubsequent actions that will terminate certain grants moving forward.  That is a prospective \naction.”  [ECF No. 47 at 33].  \nDefendants’ argument is unavailing.  While the DOE might not be attempting to claw \nback money, this is not necessary to bring the Rate Cap Policy within “the ban on retrospective \nlegislation[, which] embrace[s] all statutes [that] though operating only from their passage, affect \nvested rights and past transactions.”  Landgraf v. USI Film Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 268–69 (1994) \n(quotation omitted).  The relevant inquiry is “whether the new provision attaches new legal \nconsequences to events completed before its enactment,” and courts regularly “appl[y] the \npresumption against statutory retroactivity [in cases] involv[ing] new provisions affecting \ncontractual and property rights.”  Id. at 271; see also id. at 269 (noting “every statute, which \ntakes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws, or creates a new obligation, \nimposes a new duty, or attaches a new disability, in respect to transactions or considerations \nalready past, must be deemed retrospective” (quoting Society for Propagation of the Gospel v. \nWheeler, 22 F.Cas. 756 (No. 13,156) (CCNH 1814) (Story, J.))).   \nPlaintiffs are recipients of grant awards which “are both legally binding and have many \nof the key hallmarks of a contract,” including a negotiated indirect cost rate.  2 C.F.R. § 200.1 \n(defining “federal award” as “[t]he instrument setting forth the terms and conditions”).  For \nmany Plaintiffs, this indirect cost rate far exceeds the proposed 15 percent cap.  See, e.g., [ECF \nNo. 2-7 ¶ 12 (University of Michigan has an indirect cost rate of 56 percent)]; [ECF No. 2-18 \n¶ 12 (University of Nevada, Reno has an indirect cost rate of 47 percent)]; [ECF No. 2-19 ¶ 4 \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 38 of 49\n(Tufts University has an indirect cost rate of 58 percent)].  Thus, if the Rate Cap Policy were to \ntake effect, it “would impair the rights that the institution possessed when accepting the Notice of \nAward” by “impos[ing] a new, lower rate, [and] displacing the institutions’ right to the \npreviously negotiated—and legally binding—” indirect cost rate upon which they have operated \nand relied since accepting the award.  NIH, 2025 WL 702163, at *27; see also Landgraf, 511 \nU.S. at 270 (in assessing retroactivity, “familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, \nand settled expectations offer sound guidance”).  \nThus, at least as to current grants, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their \nclaim that the Rate Cap Policy is impermissibly retroactive.  \n5.  Other Claims \nPlaintiffs make a series of additional statutory and regulatory claims, including that the \nRate Cap Policy violates the authorizing statute (42 U.S.C. § 4708) and runs afoul of regulations \ngoverning termination of existing grants and cost recovery.  [Compl. ¶¶ 75–81 (alleging \nviolations of regulations governing grant termination); ¶¶ 82–89 (alleging violation of \nregulations governing cost recovery); ¶¶ 1–66 (alleging violation of authorizing statute)].  \nWithout commenting on the substance, the Court finds its unnecessary to address those claims at \nthis stage of the litigation, as the likelihood of success on the merits on each claim addressed \nabove is independently sufficient to support the issuance of a preliminary injunction.  The parties \nare free to re-raise these claims and any opposition thereto at a later stage.  \n \n \n6 These allegations are misnumbered.  The Court is referencing the factual allegations which \nappear in “Count V.”  \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 39 of 49\nB.  Irreparable Harm \n“Plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief must make a ‘clear showing’ that substantial and \nimmediate irreparable harm is ‘likely’ in the absence of an injunction.”  Oxford Immunotec Ltd. \nv. Qiagen, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 3d 358, 367 (D. Mass. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “To establish irreparable harm there must be an actual, \nviable, presently existing threat of serious harm,” Sierra Club v. Larson, 769 F. Supp. 420, 422 \n(D. Mass. 1991), rather than mere “conjecture, surmise, or a party’s unsubstantiated fears of \nwhat the future may have in store,” Charlesbank Equity Fund II v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d \n151, 162 (1st Cir. 2004).  That said, a movant “need not demonstrate that the denial of injunctive \nrelief will be fatal to its business,” as long as it can demonstrate a “substantial injury that is not \naccurately measurable or adequately compensable by money damages.”  Ross-Simons of \nWarwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 18–19 (1st Cir. 1996); see also P.R. Hosp. Supply, \nInc. v. Bos. Sci. Corp., 426 F.3d 503, 507 (1st Cir. 2005) (“These injuries are not irreparable \nbecause later-issued damages can properly compensate any wrong committed.”).  The alleged \nharm must be “to the movant[,] rather than to one or more third parties.”  CMM Cable Rep., Inc. \nv. Ocean Coast Props., Inc., 48 F.3d 618, 622 (1st Cir. 1995) (emphasis omitted).   \nAdditionally, courts in the First Circuit “measure irreparable harm on a sliding scale, \nworking in conjunction with a moving party’s likelihood of success on the merits such that the \nstrength of the showing necessary on irreparable harm depends in part on the degree of \nlikelihood of success shown.’”  Braintree Labs., Inc. v. Citigroup Glob. Mkts. Inc., 622 F.3d 36, \n42–43 (1st Cir. 2010) (cleaned up). \nDefendants make three main arguments regarding indirect harm.  First, they contend that \nPlaintiffs’ “primary claimed injury . . . is that they will not receive the full amount of money to \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 40 of 49\nwhich they claim to be entitled under negotiated indirect cost rates,” which “can easily be \nredressed if Plaintiffs succeed in this litigation.”  [ECF No. 47 at 35].  Second, Defendants assert \nthat “many of Plaintiffs’ claimed harms categorically do not qualify as irreparable harm” because \nthey are not harms to Plaintiff; rather, they are generalized concerns, such as “that a reduction in \nindirect cost rates will harm the economy and the United States’ competitiveness on a global \nscale,” which “properly belong to the democratically elected President and his Administration.”  \n[Id. at 36].  Third, they contend that Plaintiffs’ allegations of irreparable harm are speculative \nand remote.  [Id. at 36–37].   \nThe Court agrees with Defendants that if this case concerned only indirect cost \nreimbursements, Plaintiffs would be unable to show irreparable harm given that the lost \nreimbursement could be made up.  But a temporary loss of funding is not the only harm Plaintiffs \nhave alleged and might in fact be the least of it.  Rather, Plaintiffs have alleged that, without the \npredetermined indirect cost reimbursements to support their DOE direct grants, the research they \nare conducting pursuant to those grants will be inordinately delayed in some instances and \nentirely abandoned in others.

Without those studies, and in absence of other funding to support staff, the universities \nrun a likely and imminent risk that they will, at best, struggle to reallocate and train the next \ngeneration of scientists in their programs and, at worst, need to lay off or otherwise be unable to \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 41 of 49\nhire the brilliant minds that make up their world-renowned programs, including the \nundergraduate, doctoral, and post-graduate researchers, administrative professionals, and faculty \nmembers.  [ECF No. 2-1 ¶¶ 10, 13]; [ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 10]; [ECF No. 2-3 ¶ 15]; [ECF No. 2-4 \n¶¶ 18–19]; [ECF No. 2-5 ¶¶ 8, 14]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶¶ 16, 20]; [ECF No. 2-8 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-9 \n¶¶ 21, 26]; [ECF No. 2-10 ¶ 13]; [ECF No. 2-12 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-14 ¶¶ 11, 17]; [ECF No. 2-15 \n¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-16 ¶ 13]; [ECF No.2-17 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-18 ¶14].  As the people go, so do \nthe Nobel Prizes, the universities’ acclaim, their pipelines to students and postdoctoral \nresearchers, and their ability to build and maintain unique facilities that, in some instances, exist \nnowhere else in the world.  [ECF No. 2-1 ¶ 13]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶¶ 17, 22]; [ECF No. 2-7 ¶ 15]; \n[ECF No. 2-9 ¶ 27]; [ECF No. 2-12 ¶¶ 14, 17]; [ECF No. 2-13 ¶11]; [ECF No. 2-14 ¶ 21]; [ECF \nNo. 2-15 ¶¶ 8, 16]; [ECF No. 2-16 ¶ 8]; [ECF No. 2-17 ¶¶ 8, 14]; [ECF No. 2-18 ¶ 16]; [ECF \nNo. 25 ¶ 12].  In other words, the harm is the massive disruption and its collateral effects, rather \nthan issues around reimbursement.  While Plaintiffs may someday be able to obtain \nreimbursement for those indirect costs, the harm will have been long done, as the \nreimbursements would be earmarked for studies and programs already irreparably compromised \nand that perhaps no longer exist or involve researchers and research no longer based in the \nUnited States.     \nThe Court also disagrees that these harms are downstream or speculative.  Absent the \ninjunction, the Rate Cap Policy would have gone into effect, as evidenced by both the \nconditional termination letter in the record and the text of the Rate Cap Policy, which clearly \nstates that “the Department is undertaking action to terminate all grant awards to IHEs that do \nnot conform with this updated policy.”  [ECF No. 2 at 3].  Faced with the 15 percent rate cap, \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 42 of 49\nPlaintiffs will immediately have to make the difficult choices, described in their affidavits, \nincluding whether and how to curtail research, freeze hiring, and lay off staff.    \nDefendants further contend that the harms identified exist only as to current grants, rather \nthan future grants, and thus any injunction should be appropriately limited to current grants.  \n[ECF No. 47 at 38].  Specifically, Defendants assert that that to hold otherwise would lead to a \nslippery slope as “there is no stopping point to this argument: If a plaintiff’s desire for a future \ngovernment grant or contract, or a future government grant or contract with more advantageous \nterms, qualifies as irreparable harm, the irreparable harm element would be automatically met in \nevery case involving a potential future government grant or contract.”  [Id.]  In essence, they \ncontend that Plaintiffs cannot establish irreparable harm in speculative future grants.    \nThis argument has some initial intuitive appeal.  If future grants are speculative, so too \nmust be the harm that could befall Plaintiffs if those grants include a 15 percent indirect cost rate \ncap.  On further examination, however, the underlying premise that IHEs have nothing but a \nspeculative interest in future DOE grants that would incorporate indirect costs is divorced from \nreality.  The DOE and IHEs co-exist in a symbiotic, mutually beneficial relationship, fostered \nover decades, which is built on the DOE’s need for cutting edge research and the IHEs’ ability to \nprovide it.  As a result of this relationship, each IHE has a reasonable, non-speculative \nassumption that it will obtain future grants because, through the past grants and its own \ninvestment, it has built the highly technical, often one-of-a-kind infrastructure needed to conduct \nthe research with the assistance of those future grants, as well as assembled a team of specially \ntrained, uniquely qualified researchers and support staff needed to operate and maintain that \nequipment.  These grants are forthcoming to IHEs because, unless the DOE intends to stop \nfunding this type of research, they must be.  The Rate Cap Policy itself manifests an intent on the \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 43 of 49\nDOE’s part to continue funding IHEs; all that has changed is that the DOE now wants IHEs to \nfoot more of the bill, without regard to the individual circumstances and overhead costs of each \nIHE, which Plaintiffs have adequately established they cannot do.  [ECF No. 2-1 ¶¶ 19–21]; \n[ECF No. 2-2 ¶¶ 15–17]; [ECF No. 2-3 ¶¶ 20–23]; [ECF No. 2-4 ¶¶ 22–24]; [ECF No. 2-5 \n¶¶ 18–19]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶¶ 29–31]; [ECF No. 2-8 ¶¶ 19–207]; [ECF No. 2-9 ¶¶ 32–33]; [ECF \nNo. 2-10 ¶ 18]; [ECF No. 2-11 ¶ 16]; [ECF No. 2-12 ¶ 20]; [ECF No. 2-13 ¶¶ 17–18]; [ECF No. \n2-14 ¶¶ 12–16]; [ECF No. 2-15 ¶¶ 19–20].  \nFurther, Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged not only that the Rate Cap Policy will result \nin immediate harms but also that its “long-term impacts . . . are both cumulative and cascading.”  \n[ECF No. 2-7 ¶ 15]; [ECF No. 2-8 ¶ 16]; [ECF No. 2-9 ¶ 29]; [ECF No. 2-12 ¶ 17]; [ECF No. 2-\n13 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-15 ¶ 16]; [ECF No. 2-17 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-18 ¶ 16]; [ECF No. 2-19 ¶ 14]; \nsee also [ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 9].  These projects, once stopped, cannot simply be restarted later:  The \nloss of human capital, cumulative knowledge and sometimes the degradation of physical \ninfrastructure, is simply too great.  [ECF No. 2-1 ¶ 10]; [ECF No. 2-2 ¶ 10]; [ECF No. 2-3 ¶ 12]; \n[ECF No. 2-4 ¶ 18]; [ECF No. 2-5 ¶¶ 8, 9]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶¶ 17, 21]; [ECF No. 2-7 ¶¶ 8, 15]; \n[ECF No. 2-8 ¶¶ 6, 16]; [ECF No. 2-9 ¶¶ 19, 21, 27]; [ECF No. 2-10 ¶¶ 6–7]; [ECF No. 2-12 \n¶¶ 6, 8, 14]; [ECF No. 2-13 ¶¶ 7, 11]; [ECF No. 2-15 ¶ 16]; [ECF No. 2-17 ¶ 14]; [ECF No. 2-18 \n¶¶ 8, 14, 16].   \nPlaintiffs have demonstrated that because their collective harm “is not accurately \nmeasurable or adequately compensable by money damages, irreparable harm is a natural sequel.”  \nRoss-Simons, 102 F.3d at 19.  “Even though, as established above, the likelihood of success on \n \n \n7 The final two paragraphs of Exhibit 2-8 are both enumerated as paragraph 19.  The Court \nassumes the second paragraph 19 was inadvertent and refers to it as paragraph 20.   \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 44 of 49\nthe merits is great, which would allow a movant to show somewhat less in the way of irreparable \nharm and still garner preliminary injunctive relief, the allowance is unnecessary.”  NIH, 2025 \nWL 702163, at *31 (cleaned up).  The Court is more than convinced that the harms to Plaintiffs’ \nprograms cannot be remedied by a later monetary award and may well be irreparable in the truest \nsense of the word.   \nC.  Balance of Equities and Public Interest  \nThe Court also finds that the balance of the equities and the public interest favor granting \nPlaintiffs their requested relief.  Plaintiffs have sufficiently established that the Rate Cap Policy’s \nimpact on their programs will have a swift and deleterious effect on the public interest.  Perhaps \nmost concerning, several Plaintiffs have noted that “[f]unding disruptions would compromise \ncrucial safety protocols for handling hazardous materials, high-voltage equipment, and radiation \nsources, potentially leading to accidents.”  [ECF No. 2-7 ¶ 15]; see also [ECF No. 2-8 ¶ 13 \n(“This reduction will have deeply damaging effects on MSU’s ability to conduct DOE-funded \nresearch from day one, leaving unfunded . . . [l]ow-level radioactive waste removal[ and] \n[c]ritical environmental health and safety oversight.”); [ECF No. 2-19 ¶ 14 (“These cuts not only \nendanger the health and well-being of researchers, staff, and students, but also increase the risk \nof regulatory noncompliance, accidents, and hazardous material exposure—threatening both the \ncontinuity and credibility of the institution’s research enterprise.”)].  Beyond the obvious danger \nof unattended radioactive materials and other byproducts of nuclear research, Plaintiffs’ \nprograms also have a profound impact on their local economies, both by employing the local \ncommunity and through the power of innovation that sparks further development and spending, \nwhich would be impacted by interruption to those programs.  See, e.g., [ECF No. 2-5 ¶ 16 (“The \nUniversity [of Illinois Urbana-Champaign] employs thousands of Illinois residents and \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 45 of 49\ncollaborates with state and local partners to help solve regional challenges through joint research \nand innovation.  The University’s research also fuels spending in the regional economy, \nincluding by driving discoveries that launch new ventures, attract private investment, and make a \npositive social impact.”)]; [ECF No. 2-6 ¶ 6 (“MIT’s research also translates into innovation that \nhelps drive the U.S. economy.”); id. ¶ 24 (“MIT employs nearly 14,000 Massachusetts residents, \nincluding more than 2,300 Cambridge residents.  Spending from students, staff, and faculty \nsupport the local economy.”)]; [ECF No. 2-16 ¶ 15 (“For example, as recently reported by \nNorthstar Analytics, LLC, UW-Madison affiliated organizations and startups collectively \ncontribute $30.8B per year to the Wisconsin economy, this economic activity supports more than \n232,000 jobs and generates $1 billion in state and local taxes.”)].  \nFundamentally, the Rate Cap Policy will harm the public interest by significantly \ncompromising the ability of the DOE and IHEs to continue their federal research partnerships, \nwhich, by their nature, seek to advance the country’s energy, economic, and national security \ninterests, as well as impacting basic quality of life considerations, as the affidavits in this case \namply reflect.  Cornell alone, in partnership with the DOE, performs work “on: plasma physics \nresearch to control fusion and maintain safety and security of nuclear weapons; conversion of \ncheap carbon dioxide or methane to produce chemical fuels for economic competitiveness in the \nUnited States chemical industry; circuit design for artificial intelligence, high performance \ncomputing, and quantum technology; better materials for stealth and camouflage technologies; \nrecovery/extraction of rare earth minerals; development of biodegradable plastics that disappear \nfrom the environment; simulation tools to make fusion energy a practical reality; clarifying \ndrought risks impacting agriculture in the Western United States; and the contribution of urban \nland-use development and changes to flood risks in Philadelphia, and the extent to which zoning \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 46 of 49\nor other urban development policies can exacerbate or ameliorate these risks.”  [ECF No. 2-4 \n¶  10].  And Cornell is just one of nine Plaintiffs in this action and one of the many IHEs that \npartner with the DOE, all of whom perform vital research in similarly cutting-edge arenas.  It is \nbeyond dispute that the advancements these universities make can and often do benefit the public \nin critically important ways, and any setback to that progress is to the detriment of the country as \na whole.  \nD.  Scope of the Injunction \nHaving concluded that Plaintiffs have met their burden under the preliminary injunction \nstandard, the Court must determine the scope of that injunction.  Plaintiffs urge the Court to \npreliminarily enjoin Defendants from taking any further steps to implement the Rate Cap Policy \nin its entirety as to all grant recipients.  [ECF No. 53 at 25].  Defendants urge that the Court \ninstead “limit any remedy to those plaintiff institutions, or institutions represented by plaintiff \nassociations, that the Court concludes have shown irreparable harm warranting injunctive relief.”  \n[ECF No. 47 at 40].  They contend that “universal injunctive relief is an improper exercise of \njudicial authority.”  [ECF No. 47 at 39].  \nOn this front and under the facts of this case, the Court agrees with its sister session in \nNIH that, despite awareness that some members of the Supreme Court have expressed concerns \nabout the use of nationwide or “universal” injunctions, as the law currently stands, a nationwide \ninjunction is a reasonable and appropriate remedy in this action.  Such an injunction is necessary \n“to protect similarly situated nonparties, [and] to avoid the ‘chaos and confusion’ of a patchwork \nof injunctions . . . where the plaintiffs are dispersed throughout the United States.”  NIH, 2025 \nWL 702163, at *33 (quoting Florida v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 19 F.4th 1271, 1281–82 \n(11th Cir. 2021)).  This is further supported by the nature of the action, given that “[t]he normal \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 47 of 49\nremedy for a successful APA challenge is vacatur of the rule and its applicability to all who \nwould have been subject to it.”  Id. at *34.  “It would be anathema to reasonable jurisprudence \nthat only the named Plaintiffs should be protected from the irreparable harms of an unlawful \nregulation.”  Id.   \nE.  Stay Pending Appeal/Bond \nDefendants additionally request a stay pending appeal and ask that this Court order \nPlaintiffs to post bond.   \nRegarding the stay, “[t]he party requesting a stay bears the burden of showing that the \ncircumstances justify an exercise of that discretion.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 433–34 \n(2009).  The decision is “an exercise of judicial discretion,” which involves “consideration of \nfour factors: ‘(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) \nwhether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the \nproceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.’”  Id. (first quoting Virginian Ry. Co. v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 658, 672, (1926); and then quoting Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987)).  Defendants offer no argument as to their basis for the stay, nor do they articulate \nwhat irreparable harm will result from this Court’s refusal to grant one.  Per the analysis supra, \nthe Court finds it unlikely that Defendants will succeed on the merits of their appeal, and the \nsubstantial public interests involved warrant maintaining the status quo.  As such, Defendants’ \nrequest for a stay pending appeal is DENIED.  \nAs to bond, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c), the Court may issue a \nTRO or preliminary injunction “only if the movant gives security in an amount that the court \nconsiders proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 48 of 49\nwrongfully enjoined or restrained.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  That said, Rule 65(c) “has been read \nto vest broad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate amount of an injunction \nbond,” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999), “including the discretion to \nrequire no bond at all,” P.J.E.S. ex rel. Escobar Francisco v. Wolf, 502 F. Supp. 3d 492, 520 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (quoting Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, 107 (D.D.C. 2012)).  \nFurther, a number of cases have found that a bond is “is not necessary where requiring [one] \nwould have the effect of denying the plaintiffs their right to judicial review of administrative \naction.”  Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 F. Supp. 167, 168 (D.D.C. 1971) (collecting \ncases).  Plaintiffs here are seeking an injunction against the Rate Cap Policy because of the \nirreparable harm that would result if they cannot access or use funds beyond the 15 percent cap \nto support ongoing and future research.  Requiring them to post that difference as bond would \nnecessarily have the same financial effect and thus lead to the same harms.  As such, the Court \ndeclines to require bond.  Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. 25-cv-\n00239, 2025 WL 597959, at *19 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025) (“In a case where the government is \nalleged to have unlawfully withheld trillions of dollars of previously committed funds to \ncountless recipients, it would defy logic—and contravene the very basis of this opinion—to hold \nPlaintiffs hostage for the resulting harm.  That is especially so when Defendants—OMB and its \ndirector—will personally face no monetary injury from the injunction.”). \nVI.  CONCLUSION  \nAccordingly, for the reasons sets forth above, Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction is GRANTED.  Defendants and their officers, employees, servants, agents, \nappointees, and successors are hereby enjoined from implementing, instituting, maintaining, or \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10912-ADB     Document 62     Filed 05/15/25     Page 49 of 49\ngiving effect to the Rate Cap Policy in any form with respect to IHEs nationwide until a further \norder is issued by this Court.  \nSO ORDERED.               \n                         \nMay 15, 2025  /s/ Allison D.
