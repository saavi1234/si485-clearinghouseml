    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump administration&rsquo;s 2025 suspension and termination of federal funding to Harvard University in response to alleged antisemitism on campus</p>\r\n<p>Harvard filed this lawsuit on April 21, 2025 in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The University was represented by private counsel. The University named the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Justice, the Department of Education, the General Services Administration, the Department of Energy, the National Sciences Foundation, the Department of Defense, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and their acting agency heads as defendants.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Upon Harvard&rsquo;s request, the case was assigned to Judge Allison D. Burroughs and certified related to <a href=\"../../../../case/46388/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Association of University Professors - Harvard Faculty Chapter v. U.S. Department Of Justice</a>. &nbsp;This case is one of a series of cases brought by Harvard challenging President Trump&rsquo;s conditioning of federal funds on the University&rsquo;s adoption of programmatic and structural changes based on alleged failures to address antisemitism. (To see the Clearinghouse's collection of legal challenges to actions by the second Trump Administration, click <a href=\"../../../../collections/38759\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.)&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Harvard brought claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), alleging that the termination of funding violated the First Amendment, that the termination exceed the statutory authority of the federal government under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, and that in terminating the funds the Defendants failed to follow the proper regulatory procedures, as well as two ultra vires (action taken beyond legal authority) claims.</p>\r\n<p>On May 13, 2025, Harvard filed an amended complaint adding two new defendants: the United States Department of Agriculture, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and their respective secretaries in their official capacities. The amended complaint provided factual updates including the subsequent termination of awards and federal grants from numerous federal agencies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Harvard declined to file for preliminary relief. After a status conference on April 28, 2025, both parties agreed to go straight to summary judgment on an expedited briefing schedule. Harvard moved for summary judgement on June 2, 2025. The government moved for cross- summary judgement on June 16, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 23, 2025, the States of Iowa, Alaska &nbsp;Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, and Texas submitted an amicus curiae brief in support of the government. In the brief, the States wrote that:&nbsp;</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&nbsp;There are apparently three constant truths in American life: death, taxes, and Harvard University&rsquo;s discrimination against Jews.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>On September 3, 2025, Judge Burroughs granted Harvard's motion for summary judgement as to the following counts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The government's termination of federal funding and threats of future termination was unlawful under the APA because the terminations violate the First Amendment by retaliating against Harvard for unfavored speech and by burdening Harvard&rsquo;s First Amendment rights through constitutionally impermissible funding conditions. (Count 1)</li>\r\n<li>The freeze and termination of federal financial assistance due to allegations of antisemitism were in excess of the government's statutory authority under Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act. (Count 3)</li>\r\n<li>The government failed to follow regulatory procedures under Title VI (notice of noncompliance and opportunity for a hearing) when terminating the federal funds in violation of the APA. (Count 4)</li>\r\n<li>The Freeze Orders were arbitrary and capricious under the APA because the evidence provided by defendants showed there was little investigation done into antisemitism at Harvard and thus there was little rational connection between the Freeze Orders and the explanation provided by the agency. (Count 5, in part)&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Judge Burroughs granted the government's motion for summary judgement in regards to the following counts:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The government's actions in imposing viewpoint-based conditions on Harvard's funding and terminating funding agreements violate the First Amendment and lack lawful authority. (Count 2)</li>\r\n<li>The Termination Letters were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. The court granted summary judgement on the Termination Letters because these claims fall under the jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims. (Count 5, in part)</li>\r\n<li>The government's actions contravened Harvard's right to due process and lacked a lawful authority. (Count 6)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The judge granted summary judgment on Counts 2 and 6 because these ultra vires claims were adequately covered by the APA remedies granted. Both motions were otherwise denied.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The court ordered the following:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The Freeze Orders were vacated and set aside as arbitrary and capricious.</li>\r\n<li>The Freeze Orders and Termination Letters were found to be violative of the First Amendment.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp;The Court vacated and set aside the Termination Letters as violative of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</li>\r\n<li>The government was enjoined from giving force to the Freeze Orders or Termination Letters. They were enjoined from refusing to grant federal funding pursuant to that order as well. The government was further enjoined from withholding funding from Harvard on purported grounds of discrimination without compliance with the terms of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>2025 WL 2528380.</p>\r\n<p>On September 10, 2025, Harvard voluntarily dismissed their last two claims under the APA regarding the Spending Clause and 5th Amendment Due Process, effectively resolving all the claims in the lawsuit. The parties filed a status update on September 19, 2025 indicating the parties are working to implement Judge Burroughs&rsquo; order, with the next status report due on October 3, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>This case is currently ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "In 2025, the Trump administration stopped and took away federal funding from Harvard University because of claims that the school did not do enough to fight antisemitism on campus. Harvard did not agree with this decision, so the university sued the federal government in court.\r\nHarvard argued that the government broke the law by taking away the funding. They said the government was punishing them for their free speech and not following the proper legal steps. Many different government agencies were named in Harvard’s lawsuit.\r\nJudge Allison D. Burroughs handled the case. Instead of a long trial, both sides agreed to have the judge decide based on written arguments. Some states also joined in to support the government.\r\nOn September 3, 2025, the judge decided that the government was wrong to stop Harvard’s funding. The judge said the government didn’t follow the rules and violated Harvard’s rights to free speech. Because of this, Harvard’s funding had to be restored, and the government was told not to take it away again without following the law.\r\nSome of Harvard’s other claims were not decided in their favor because the court said other legal rules applied. After this decision, Harvard dropped its last two claims, and both sides started working on carrying out the judge’s order.\r\nThe case is not completely finished, but for now, Harvard is getting its federal funding back and both sides are trying to follow the court’s decision.",

Pursuant to Local Rule 40.1(g)(5)(B), Plaintiff President and Fellows of Harvard \nCollege hereby certifies that this case is related to a previously filed case, American Association \nof University Professors—Harvard Faculty Chapter v. United States Department of Justice¸ No. \n1:25-cv-10910-ADB (D. Mass. Apr. 11, 2025) (the “AAUP case”), currently pending before the \nHonorable Allison D. Burroughs. \n2.  Under Local Rule 40.1(g)(1), “a civil case shall be deemed related to another civil \ncase” if (A) “some or all of the parties are the same,” and (B) “the cases involve the same or \nsubstantially similar issues of fact” or “arise out of the same occurrence, transaction or property.” \nL.R. 40.1(g)(1)(A), (B)(i)-(ii). Both criteria are satisfied here. \n3.  The first criterion is satisfied because some of the defendants in each case are the \nsame. \n4.  The second criterion is satisfied because the cases do not just involve “common \nquestion[s] of law” or the “same or substantially similar challenges to a law, regulation, or \ngovernment policy or practice,” L.R. 40.1(g)(3), but also involve “substantially similar issues of \nfact,” L.R. 40.1(g)(1)(B)(i), creating the risk of inconsistent factual determinations and judgments \nshould the cases not be deemed related. \n5.  Plaintiffs in both actions challenge the unlawful actions related to federal funding \nfor Harvard University. Both the plaintiffs in the AAUP case (members of Harvard’s faculty) and \nPlaintiff here (Harvard University itself) allege that they will be harmed in a substantially similar \nmanner. Cf. Conservation Law Found., Inc. v. Mass. Water Res. Auth., No. 1:22-cv-10626-AK, \n2023 WL 1111135, at *2 (D. Mass. Jan. 30, 2023) (Kelley, J.) (deeming related two cases \nconcerning “the same authority[’s]” regulatory “compliance” at the “same treatment plant”). \n6.  Moreover, failing to deem these cases related would subject both defendants and \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-12     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 4\n \nplaintiffs  to  the  risk  of  inconsistent  factual  determinations.  Those  inconsistent  factual \ndeterminations could, in turn, subject the parties to conflicting court orders, further demonstrating \nthat the two cases “involve the same or substantially similar issues of fact.” L.R. 40.1(g)(1)(B)(i); \nsee Order, New Jersey v. Trump, No. 25-cv-10139-LTS (D. Mass Jan. 24, 2025) (ECF No. 71) \n(determining cases related under L.R. 40.1(g)(1) where “random reassignment of th[e] case poses \na risk of different determinations as to the same factual issues, as well as a possible risk that \nDefendants might become subject to conflicting court orders regarding their treatment of Ms. Doe \nand members of the organizations that are also plaintiffs in the Doe case”).  \n7.  Furthermore, because both the plaintiffs in the AAUP case and Plaintiff here face \nsubstantially similar irreparable harms from actions related to federal funding at Harvard, both sets \nof plaintiffs seek equitable relief barring defendants from implementing their actions. There is thus \nfurther overlap in the factual determinations that the Court will need to make in both cases. \n8.  Accordingly, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this case be deemed related to the \nprior pending AAUP case and assigned to Judge Burroughs. \n   \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-12     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 4\n \n   \nDated: April 21, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n  /s/ Steven P.

Scientific advancement and the pursuit of knowledge fuel America’s innovation, \neconomic success, and global leadership. The commitment to expanding human understanding is \nfoundational at American universities, including Harvard, the Nation’s oldest institution of higher \nlearning. Since its founding nearly four centuries ago, Harvard’s students, faculty, and researchers \nhave helped identify and solve some of society’s most pressing problems. Those pathbreaking and \nlife-saving advancements are due in part to the longstanding collaboration between universities \nsuch as Harvard and the federal Government dating back to the Second World War. Millions of \nAmericans are healthier and safer as a result. Federal funding has enabled researchers at Harvard \nto develop novel drugs to fight Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, engineer nanofibers to \nprotect servicemembers and first responders, support American astronauts in space, and design an \nartificial intelligence system that can be used to diagnose and treat cancer. \n2.  In recent weeks, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical \nfunding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible. To date, the Government has—\nwith little warning and even less explanation—slashed billions of dollars in federal funding to \nuniversities across America, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, the University of \nPennsylvania,  and  Northwestern.  This  case  involves  the  Government’s  efforts  to  use  the \nwithholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard. \n3.  On April 11, 2025, citing concerns of antisemitism and ideological capture, the \nGovernment identified ten conditions Harvard must satisfy to receive federal research funding \nalready committed to by the Government and relied on by Harvard, its researchers, and its affiliates \n(the “April 11 Letter,” attached as Exhibit A). Ex. A at 2, 4. The Government dictated that Harvard \n“reform and restructur[e]” its governance to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and \nadministrators. Id. at 2. It required that Harvard hire a third-party to conduct an “audit” of the \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 51\n \nviewpoints of Harvard’s student body, faculty, and staff. Id. at 3-4. Then, based on the results of \nthis university-wide viewpoint audit, Harvard must “hir[e] a critical mass of new faculty” and \n“admit[] a critical mass of students” to achieve “viewpoint diversity” in “each department, field, \nor teaching unit”—to the Government’s satisfaction as determined in the Government’s sole \ndiscretion. Id. And the Government has demanded that Harvard terminate or reform its academic \n“programs” to the Government’s liking. Id. at 4. All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other \nuniversities  is  clear:  Allow  the  Government  to  micromanage  your  academic  institution  or \njeopardize the institution’s ability to pursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and \ninnovative solutions. \n4.  Harvard is committed to “combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms \nof bigotry”1 and to “broaden[ing] the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within [its] community.”2 \nHarvard is actively undertaking structural reforms to do both. And while important steps have been \ntaken, Harvard acknowledges that there is still “much work to do.”3 Harvard also fully recognizes \nthe requirement that it comply with all federal laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964. \n5.  But, as Harvard made clear last week in a letter to the Government (attached as \nExhibit B), “[n]either Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by \nthe federal government.” Ex. B at 2. In the words of Harvard’s President, Alan M. Garber, “[t]he \n \n1   Alan  M.  Garber,  Our  Resolve,  Harvard  Univ.:  Off.  of  the  President  (Mar.  31,  2025), \nhttps://perma.cc/4UC7-E65V. \n2   Alan M. Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, Harvard Univ.: Off. of the \nPresident (Apr. 14, 2025), https://perma.cc/L4G7-J8UB. \n3   Garber, Our Resolve, supra n.1. \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 51\n \nUniversity  will  not  surrender  its  independence  or  relinquish  its  constitutional  rights.”4  “No \ngovernment—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can \nteach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”5 \n6.  In response to Harvard’s defense of its own constitutional freedoms, the federal \nGovernment announced that it was freezing “$2.2 billion in multiyear grants and $60M in \nmultiyear contract value to Harvard University” (the “Freeze Order,” attached as Exhibit C). Ex. \nC at 2. Within hours of the Freeze Order, Harvard began receiving stop work orders. The freezing \nof federal funds amounts to final agency action and has put vital medical, scientific, technological, \nand other research at risk. And that risk is growing. Just yesterday, it was reported that the \nGovernment is “planning to pull an additional $1 billion of [Harvard]’s funding for health \nresearch.”6 \n7.  Defendants’ actions are unlawful. The First Amendment does not permit the \nGovernment to “interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological \nbalance,” Moody v. NetChoice, 603 U.S. 707, 741 (2024), nor may the Government “rely[] on the \n‘threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression’ of \ndisfavored speech,” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 189 (2024) (citation omitted). The \nGovernment’s  attempt  to  coerce  and  control  Harvard  disregards  these  fundamental  First \nAmendment  principles,  which  safeguard  Harvard’s  “academic  freedom.”  Asociacion  de \nEducacion Privada de P.R., Inc. v. Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007). A threat such as \n \n4   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2; see also Research Funding, \nHarvard Univ., https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding. \n5   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2. \n6   Douglas Belkin & Liz Essley Whyte, Trump Administration Irate at Harvard, Plans to Pull \nAdditional $1 Billion in Funding, Wall St. J. (Apr. 20, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/5e7r7abm. \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 5 of 51\n \nthis to a university’s academic freedom strikes an equal blow to the research conducted and \nresulting advancements made on its campus. \n8.  The Government’s actions flout not just the First Amendment, but also federal laws \nand regulations. The Government has expressly invoked the protections against discrimination \ncontained in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as a basis for its actions. Make no mistake: \nHarvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural \nreforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus. But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those \nongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of funding for medical, scientific, \ntechnological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism and Title VI \ncompliance. Moreover, Congress in Title VI set forth detailed procedures that the Government \n“shall” satisfy before revoking federal funding based on discrimination concerns. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1. Those procedures effectuate Congress’s desire that “termination of or refusal to grant \nor to continue” federal financial assistance be a remedy of last resort. Id. The Government made \nno effort to follow those procedures—nor the procedures provided for in Defendants’ own agency \nregulations—before freezing Harvard’s federal funding. \n9.  These  fatal  procedural  shortcomings  are  compounded  by  the  arbitrary  and \ncapricious nature of Defendants’ abrupt and indiscriminate decision. Even before the freeze, the \nGovernment had threatened to terminate up to $8.7 billion in federal funding not just to Harvard, \nbut also to preeminent Boston hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel \nDeaconess Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Children’s Hospital, and the \nDana-Farber Cancer Institute. These hospitals are independent corporate entities with their own \nboards of directors or trustees and their own separate officers, leadership, and management. They \nare not under Harvard’s control. The hospitals have no control over Harvard’s enforcement of Title \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 6 of 51\n \nVI requirements, and vice versa. These hospitals have their own tax identification numbers, \nendowments, and accounts. And they seek and receive federal financial assistance directly from \nfederal agencies, not through Harvard.  \n10.  The Government has not—and cannot—identify any rational connection between \nantisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has frozen \nthat aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American security, and \nmaintain  America’s  position  as  a  global  leader  in  innovation.  Nor  has  the  Government \nacknowledged the significant consequences that the indefinite freeze of billions of dollars in \nfederal research funding will have on Harvard’s research programs, the beneficiaries of that \nresearch, and the national interest in furthering American innovation and progress.  \n11.  The Government characterized its action to cut off $2.2 billion in multi-year grants \nas a “freeze” rather than as “the termination of or refusal to grant or to continue assistance” under \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. But the effect is the same. Under whatever name, the Government has ceased \nthe flow of funds to Harvard as part of its pressure campaign to force Harvard to submit to the \nGovernment’s control over its academic programs. That, in itself, violates Harvard’s constitutional \nrights. But the Government has also failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress \nrequired under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring \nthe freeze unlawful. By accepting federal funds, Harvard agreed to abide by the provisions in Title \nVI and the relevant agencies’ corresponding regulations. But Harvard’s agreement is not a blank \ncheck for agencies to impose the Government’s recent, unrelated demands as a condition of \ncontinued funding. See Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) \n(“[T]he legitimacy of Congress’ power to enact Spending Clause legislation rests . . . on whether \nthe recipient [of federal funds] voluntarily and knowingly accepts the terms of that contract,” and \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 7 of 51\n \n“[r]ecipients cannot knowingly accept the deal with the Federal Government unless they would \nclearly understand the obligations that would come along with doing so.” (cleaned up)). \n12.  Defendants’ actions threaten Harvard’s academic independence and place at risk \ncritical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a \nbroader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights. In the \ndays since Harvard rejected the Government’s unconstitutional demands, the Government has \nlaunched multiple investigations and other actions against Harvard. Although the Government has \nindicated that it has made several attempts to contact the University, at no time has it rescinded the \ndraconian demands laid out in the April 11 Letter. Indeed, the Government has only ratcheted up \ncuts to funding, investigations, and threats that will hurt students from every state in the country \nand around the world, as well as research that improves the lives of millions of Americans. \n13.

Harvard University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States, \nand one of the world’s leading research universities. For decades, universities like Harvard have \nconducted research identified by the federal Government as essential to advancing the boundaries \nof human knowledge and improving the lives of Americans. While this partnership traces back to \nour country’s founding, the partnership between the Government and universities grew stronger \nduring  and  after  the  Second  World  War,  as  the  Government  increasingly  recognized  that \nuniversities can help achieve scientific and technological advances that benefit the public.7 \n35.  Federal funding for university research serves as a cornerstone of the American \nresearch system. It is an essential resource for the groundbreaking discoveries made today by \nHarvard’s faculty and staff, leading not only to scientific advancement and innovation, but also to \nthe country’s economic growth. Today, Harvard’s federally funded research includes particular \nstrengths in oncology, immunology, neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics, quantum science, \nand other areas of technology that support our national economy and defense. \n36.  Harvard’s  researchers,  in  collaboration  with  the  federal  Government,  have \npioneered groundbreaking innovations that make millions of people in our country healthier and \n \n7   Ronald Brownstein, Trump’s Drive Against Top Universities Could Carry a Big Economic \nCost, CNN (Apr. 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/HR4S-5MC2. \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 11 of 51\n \nsafer across a wide range of medical, engineering, scientific, and other fields. Their research \nincludes, for example: \n•  Cancer Research: Harvard’s cancer research includes identifying mechanisms that drive \ndisease development at all stages including tumor metastasis; developing new therapeutic \napproaches with the goal of preventing, targeting and suppressing cancer at every stage; \nmapping the metabolic signaling pathways that drive the association of cancer with other \ndiseases, to restore proper cellular function and enhance prevention; and developing a new \nmachine learning method to model the behavior of all 25,000 human genes as they respond \nto high-intensity treatments like chemotherapy, which the National Cancer Institute cited \nas an advancement in basic cancer research that will lay the groundwork for future clinical \nbreakthroughs. \n•  Infectious Diseases Research: Harvard researchers study infectious diseases  to better \nunderstand and address the global threat of multidrug-resistant infections; develop new \ntools for global pandemic prevention; discover new therapeutic antibodies and small \nmolecules to treat or cure viral diseases; and develop enhanced approaches to monitor \ndisease outbreaks and to predict patterns of spread. \n•  Microbiome Research: Harvard’s microbiome research includes developing new frontiers \nin precision medicine that can help individuals reduce their risk of cancer and other \ndiseases by better understanding and leveraging our bodies’ relationship with the multitude \nof bacteria and other microorganisms that contribute to human health and disease. \n•  Toxin Reduction Research: Harvard’s toxin reduction research includes studying the harm \nfrom microplastics on sperm counts and fertility, and developing life-saving guidance for \nthose exposed to high levels of toxins, including firefighters, individuals working in \nenvironments with high exposure potentials (e.g., members of the military, miners, and \nchemical factory workers), and children in rural communities. \n•  Neurological Research: Harvard’s neurological research includes identifying numerous \nmodifiable risk factors for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological \ndiseases including conditions that are generally age-related, such as Alzheimer’s (and \nother forms of dementia) and stroke, which creates the potential to significantly cut disease \nincidence and reduce healthcare costs. Other research involves efforts to better understand \nthe role of infections in seeding neurodegenerative disorders, with important implications \nfor prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. And other research involves studying the long-\nterm neurologic effects of radiation and chemotherapy-based treatment on young children \nwho survived cancer and identifying treatments to improve outcomes that also reduce the \nimpact  of  therapy-related  collateral  damage,  which  is  also  relevant  to  adult  cancer \nsurvivors. \n•  Biotechnology:  Harvard’s  biotechnology  research  includes  studying  how  spaceflight, \nincluding  space-related  radiation,  affects  blood  cell  formation  in  astronauts  on  the \nupcoming Space Station and ARTEMIS missions. That research is also developing a new \nclass  of  anesthetics  that  could  lead  to  breakthroughs  in  the  care  of  wounded \nservicemembers in the field that would obviate the need for trained anesthesiologists or \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 12 of 51\n \nhospitalization. And it is advancing organ chip technology to further understanding of, \namong other things, illnesses and injuries that result from high doses of radiation. \n•  Technological  Innovation:  Additional  research  at  Harvard  supports  innovations  in \nquantum computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, nanomaterials, microchip \ndesign, biomechanics, chemical engineering, next-generation batteries, computer science, \n“smart” living environments for the elderly, and more.  \n•  Other Military Advancements and National Security: Harvard also dedicates research to \nreducing the short- and long-term consequences of traumatic battlefield related injuries; \ndeveloping soft robotics for enhancing battlefield performance; creating compact and \nrapidly deployable (foldable) bridges and other structures for military use; developing \nradiation countermeasures and limb regeneration; and developing hack-resistant computer \nnetworks, rapid infectious agent diagnostics, and ways to combat antibiotic resistance.  \n37.  Federal funding for university research typically flows through a grant process \nadministered by federal agencies. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 241(a)(3) (authorizing NIH to “make \ngrants-in-aid to universities” for research support). As NIH explains, it is “the largest public funder \nof biomedical research in the world,” investing “most of its nearly $48 billion budget in medical \nresearch seeking to enhance life and to reduce illness and disability.”8 Through the appropriations \nprocess, Congress establishes the annual budgets for research-focused federal agencies like NIH, \nNSF,  NASA,  and  others  that  fund  university  research.  See,  e.g.,  Further  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 656-60 (2024) (appropriating funds for \nNIH research); Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 157-63 (2024) \n(appropriating funds for NSF and NASA research). These appropriations directly determine how \nmuch money is available to universities and other research institutions for research grants that are \nmost often awarded on a competitive basis. \n38.  Pursuant to Congress’s directives, the federal Government fuels critical research at \nHarvard, which is one of the nation’s leading recipients of NIH grants. Along with investments by \nthe universities themselves, these grants secure the funding necessary to pursue biomedical \n \n8   Grants & Funding, Nat’l Insts. of Health, https://perma.cc/B6CV-TKP7. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 13 of 51\n \nresearch and other research endeavors across the University. Numerous Harvard professors, \nincluding Nobel laureates, rely on NIH and other federal funding for their work.9 Federally funded \nresearch at Harvard has led to life-altering advancements in improving cancer diagnoses.10 It \nsupports brain health and trauma research for veterans.11 And federal funding has supported \nprojects  focused  on  understanding  neurodegenerative  disease  and  creating  a  new  class  of \nantibiotics to treat infections.12 It has also enabled Harvard researchers to study how spaceflight \naffects blood cell formation in astronauts on upcoming missions.13 \n39.  Harvard’s research programs—funded in part by Defendants—serve as training \ngrounds for the next generation of scientific, technological, medical, and public health leaders, \nwith grants supporting the work of thousands of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. \nTitle VI and Federal Financial Assistance \n40.  Title VI provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, \ncolor, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” \n \n9   8 Harvard Medical School Researchers Receive NIH Awards, Harvard Med.

Title  VI  permits  an  agency,  under  detailed  conditions,  to  enforce  this \nsubstantive provision by terminating or suspending federal financial assistance. \n41.  If an agency wants to freeze federal financial assistance to universities based on \nalleged civil rights violations under Title VI, then it must follow a detailed and mandatory statutory \nframework. The Supreme Court has referred to these procedural limits as “elaborate restrictions \non agency enforcement.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290 (2001).  \n42.  No action to terminate or refuse to grant or continue federal financial assistance \nmay be taken “until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or \npersons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot \nbe secured by voluntary means.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; see Adams v. Richardson, 351 F. Supp. \n636,  641  (D.D.C.  1972)  (“The  underlying  thrust  of  the  statute  requires  that  the  agency \ninvolved . . . attempt at the outset to secure compliance by voluntary means, if such method is \nreasonably possible. This course involves negotiation, and negotiation takes time.”); cf. Mach \nMining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. 480, 486-89 (2015) (discussing similar procedural requirement \nin Title VII context). \n43.  If the agency determines that voluntary compliance is not possible, then it must \ninitiate formal proceedings, specifically a hearing, and must make express findings on the record \nbefore terminating or refusing to grant or to continue federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1; see Washington Legal Found. v. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The \nagency head must file “a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action” \nwith the relevant committees in the House and Senate. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. Further, the action \ndoes not “become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.” Id. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 15 of 51\n \n44.  The agency Defendants’ regulations layer on top of the statutory text of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1 and provide additional details on procedural requirements for any termination or refusal \nto grant or to continue federal financial assistance based on Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8-.10 \n(HHS); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8 (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-1 to -4 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108 \n(DOJ). These regulations are binding on the agencies that issued them. \n45.  Defendants know and are capable of following these mandatory procedural steps. \nOn the very same day as the April 11 Letter, DOJ’s Civil Rights Division sent Harvard a letter \nannouncing that it was “commencing a compliance review investigation of Harvard University \n[specifically Harvard Medical School] pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d et seq.,” and noting that “[i]f we conclude that Harvard University is violating \nTitle VI, we will inform you and work with you to secure compliance by informal voluntary means. \n28 C.F.R. §§ 42.107 & 42.108.”14 \nThe University’s Response to Antisemitism on Harvard’s Campus \n46.  On October 7, 2023, the terrorist organization Hamas conducted a surprise attack \non Israeli citizens, killing and brutalizing thousands of Israelis and Americans and taking more \nthan 240 people hostage.15 This began an ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.16 \n47.  The escalating conflict in the Middle East dominated headlines around the globe. \nIn the United States, protests erupted on university campuses across the country. Like other \nschools, Harvard experienced increased tensions among members of its campus community, \n \n14   Letter from Harmeet K. Dhillon, Assistant Att’y Gen., Civ.

Harvard has made policy and other changes over the last year aimed at ensuring its \ncampus is safe, fair, and welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students. Harvard has adopted new \naccountability procedures and clarified policies; imposed meaningful discipline for those who \nviolate applicable policies; enhanced programs designed to address bias and promote ideological \ndiversity and civil discourse; hired staff to support these programs and support students; and \nenhanced safety and security measures.  \n49.  In January 2024, then-interim President Garber and the Deans of Harvard’s schools \nissued Guidance on Protest and Dissent under the University-wide Statement on Rights and \nResponsibilities.18  This  Guidance  made  clear  that  protests  are  not  permitted  in  classrooms, \nlibraries, dormitories, dining halls, Harvard offices, or other places where they “would interfere \nwith the normal activities of the University.”19 It also reiterated that protests may not interfere \n“with the free flow of vehicular, bicycle, or pedestrian traffic” on campus.20  \n \n17   J.

In August 2024, Harvard issued updated information on Rules for Use of Campus \nSpaces,21 which expressly prohibit, among other things, structures such as tents, unauthorized \nexhibits and displays, and excessive noise.22 \n51.  In September 2024, Harvard released Guidance explaining that online “doxing” \nviolates the University’s prohibitions on “intense personal harassment” and constitutes bullying \nunder its Non-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying Policies.23  \n52.  In November 2024, Harvard issued a “Frequently Asked Questions” statement \n(“FAQs”) on “Protests in Libraries” explaining how its Protest and Dissent Guidelines found in \nthe University-wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities apply to protests in Harvard’s \nlibraries. The FAQs underscore that when a library space is used to “express a shared message,” \neven if the participants are silent, the demonstration “interfere[s] with the room’s purpose as a \nplace of study and research” and violates University policies.24  \n53.  Harvard has also made changes to clarify the scope of prohibited conduct aimed at \nJewish  and  Israeli  students.  In  January  2025,  Harvard  committed  to  take  account  of  the \nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (“IHRA”) definition of antisemitism in its anti-\nharassment policies and disciplinary proceedings.25 The United States, as a member of IHRA, uses \n \n21   Rules for Use of Campus Spaces, Harvard Univ.: Off. of the Exec.

In March 2025, Harvard released updated “Frequently Asked Questions” clarifying \nthat both Jewish and Israeli identities are covered by the University’s Non-Discrimination and \nAnti-Bullying Policies, that the IHRA definition of antisemitism will be used, and that IHRA \nexamples will be considered in assessing incidents.26 The guidance also made clear that the Non-\nDiscrimination policy applies to conduct targeting Zionists.27 \n55.  Harvard has taken action to enforce these policies in response to campus incidents \nin the current academic year. During the fall 2024 semester, Harvard suspended library access for \ndozens of students and faculty members who violated University policies in connection with \nprotests in Harvard’s college, law school, and divinity school libraries.28 In March 2025, Harvard \nterminated a University employee who tore down Chabad posters (which showed images of Israeli \nhostages) in violation of Harvard’s policy against “‘tampering with or removing’ approved \ndisplays.”29  And  in  April  2025,  Harvard  suspended  the  undergraduate  Palestine  Solidarity \n \n26   Frequently Asked Questions, Harvard Univ.: Off. for Cmty.

Well before the Government’s engagement, Harvard had initiated steps to address \nantisemitism on campus. Recognizing the seriousness of this issue, Harvard has taken and will \ncontinue to take steps to do so in the future. \n57.  Concurrently  with  these  changes,  a  Presidential  Task  Force  on  Combating \nAntisemitism (“Harvard Task Force”) was formed on January 19, 2024, by President Garber and \nwas charged with “identifying the root causes of and contributing factors to bias-based behaviors \non campus,” “evaluating evidence regarding the characteristics and frequency of these behaviors,” \nand “recommending approaches to combat bias and to mitigate its impact on campus.”31  \n58.  The Harvard Task Force released its preliminary recommendations on June 6, \n2024.32 The Harvard Task Force observed that, since October 2023, Jewish and Israeli students \nhad been subject to incidents of “shunning, harassment, and intimidation” on campus.33 In \nresponse, the Harvard Task Force proposed “short-term actionable items” including releasing a \nstatement  clarifying  Harvard’s  values,  strengthening  anti-bullying  policies,  and  fostering \nconstructive dialogue on campus.34 Harvard has already acted on these recommendations. \n \n30   Samuel A.

On February 3, 2025, DOJ announced the formation of a multi-agency Task Force \nto Combat Antisemitism (“Federal Task Force”) including representatives from the Department of \nEducation, HHS, and other agencies, led by Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, Leo Terrell.35 \n61.  On February 26, 2025, a news article reported Terrell as saying, “When you see \nuniversities start losing millions of dollars in federal funding, you’re going to see a change in their \nbehavior.”36 A few days later, Terrell stated in a Fox Business clip he later shared on X, “I’ve \ntargeted ten schools. Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC. Let me tell you what we’re \ngoing to do. We’re going to take away your funding.”37 These statements echo earlier comments \nmade by Terrell and President Donald J. Trump. President Trump’s campaign website touted his \nplan  “to  reclaim  our  once  great  educational  institutions  from  the  radical  Left  and  Marxist \nmaniacs,”38 including by threatening to “take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect \n \n35   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Justice Department Announces Formation of Task Force \nto Combat Anti-Semitism (Feb. 3, 2025), https://perma.cc/Z4UV-HB2Y. \n36   Akiva Van Koningsveld, Head of DOJ Antisemitism Task Force: We’ll Put Hamas Supporters \nin Jail ‘for Years,’ Jewish News Syndicate (Feb. 26, 2025), https://perma.cc/5327-BU4R. \n37   @TheLeoTerrell, X.com (Feb. 28, 2025, 11:48 AM ET), https://perma.cc/5NBW-B6P5.  \n38   Agenda47:  Protecting  Students  from  the  Radical  Left  and  Marxist  Maniacs  Infecting \nEducational Institutions, DonaldJTrump.com (July 17, 2023), https://perma.cc/7VKE-VN89.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 21 of 51\n \nby taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments” from “Harvard and \nother once-respected universities.”39 And prior to Terrell’s appointment as Senior Counsel to the \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and head of the Federal Task Force, he promised that \n“Harvard will lose much more [funding] effective January 2025” because “America will no longer \nfund Jew Hating Schools!”40 \n62.  On February 27, 2025, Harvard received a letter (attached as Exhibit D) from the \nFederal Task Force. That letter requested a meeting “within 30 days with relevant administrators, \nfaculty, staff members, and any on-campus Jewish stakeholder groups” to help the Federal Task \nForce “fully and objectively evaluate the allegations and determine what further action, if any, \nmay be warranted.” Ex. D at 3. \n63.  On February 28, 2025, the Federal Task Force issued a press release (attached as \nExhibit E) announcing its plans to visit ten university campuses, including Harvard, to gather \ninformation about allegations of antisemitic incidents as it considers whether remedial action is \nwarranted. \n64.  In the weeks following DOJ’s letter to Harvard requesting a meeting and the \nFederal Task Force’s press release announcing campus visits, Harvard worked with Government \nofficials to schedule an on-campus meeting. A campus visit was scheduled for late April 2025.  \n65.  On March 31, 2025, Harvard received a letter from GSA (the “March 31 Letter,” \nattached as Exhibit F).

The cover e-mail (attached as \nExhibit G) transmitting the letter to President Garber further confirmed: “This review is being \nconducted in support of President Trump’s Executive Order, ‘Additional Measures to Combat \nAnti-Semitism.’” Ex. G at 2. And Defendants’ press release announcing the review offered even \nfurther confirmation: the review of funding is “part of an investigation aimed at eliminating anti-\nSemitic harassment on college campuses.”41 The press release referred to a “similar ongoing \nreview of Columbia University,”42 and linked to another press release concerning “ongoing \ninvestigations for potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act” at Columbia.43 \n67.  On April 1, 2025, at a private lunch, President Trump proposed canceling all federal \nfunds promised to Harvard. According to an anonymous source, President Trump asked, “What if \nwe never pay them? . . . Wouldn’t that be cool?”44 \n68.

Id. at 2-3. \nThe April 3 Letter further stated that Harvard had “failed to protect American students and faculty \nfrom antisemitic violence and harassment in addition to other alleged violations of Title VI and \nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964” and closed by calling for “immediate cooperation in \nimplementing these critical reforms” as a prerequisite for continued federal funding. Id.   \n70.  On April 11, 2025, HHS, GSA, and the Department of Education sent another letter \nto President Garber. Ex. A. The April 11 Letter, which “incorporates and supersedes” the April 3 \nLetter, similarly laid out a list of conditions to “maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the \nfederal government,” including the following:  \n•  “Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring. . . .

The University must . . . , to the satisfaction of the \nfederal government, disclose the source and purpose of all foreign funds; cooperate with \nthe federal government in a forensic audit of foreign funding sources and uses, including \nhow that money was used by Harvard, its agents, and . . . third parties acting on Harvard’s \ncampus.” On a quarterly basis through the end of 2028, “the University shall submit to the \nfederal government a report—certified for accuracy—that documents its progress on the \nimplementation of the[se] reforms.” \n \nEx. A at 2-6 (emphases added). \n71.  The  April  11  Letter  stated  the  Government’s  expectation  of  “immediate \ncooperation  in  implementing  these  critical  reforms”  if  the  University  wanted  to  “maintain \nHarvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.” Id. at 2, 6. \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 25 of 51\n \n72.  On April 14, 2025, Harvard declined to accede to the Government’s demands. In a \nletter  to  the  Government,  Harvard’s  lawyers  said,  “Neither  Harvard  nor  any  other  private \nuniversity can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.” Ex. B at 3. Because the \nApril 11 Letter “presents demands that, in contravention of the First Amendment, invade university \nfreedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court,” the response said, “Harvard is not prepared to \nagree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration” and “will not \naccept the government’s terms.” Id. at 2-3. \n73.  President Garber, in a statement to the Harvard community, wrote, “Although some \nof the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority \nrepresent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.”45 He also \nexplained, “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private \nuniversities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they \ncan pursue.”46  \nDefendants’ Unlawful “Freeze” of Harvard’s Research Funding \n74.  Just hours after Harvard rejected the Government’s demands for control over its \nacademic enterprise, the Federal Task Force “announc[ed] a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year \ngrants and $60M in multi-year contract value to Harvard University.” Ex. C at 2. The Freeze Order \ncited “[t]he harassment of Jewish students” and “the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic \nin our nation’s most prestigious universities and colleges.” Id.  \n75.  The Government immediately began implementing the Freeze Order. Within hours \nof the Freeze Order, Harvard began receiving stop work orders. \n \n45   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2. \n46   Id. \n  24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 26 of 51\n \n76.  A few days later, reports surfaced that the Director of NIH’s Office of Policy for \nExtramural Research Administration had informed other officials at NIH that the agency had \n“received confirmation from HHS/IOS to hold off on making awards to schools where the funds \nhave been frozen, i.e., Columbia, Brown, Northwestern, Cornell, Weill-Cornell, Harvard.”47 The \nDirector also noted that “HHS/IOS has stated that we should not provide any communications to \nthese schools about whether or why the funds are frozen.”48 \n77.  On April 20, 2025, it was reported that the “Trump administration has grown so \nfurious with Harvard University” that “it is planning to pull an additional $1 billion of the school’s \nfunding for health research.”49 \n78.  Harvard anticipates further freezes, payment delays, and possibly even terminations \nas a result of the Freeze Order. \n79.  The Office of Management and Budget’s (“OMB”) Uniform Guidance (which \napplies  to  all  federal  Government  agencies  that  award  research  grants)  and  specific  HHS \nregulations (which apply directly to NIH, among other HHS subagencies) require the awarding \nagency to reimburse award recipients within 30 calendar days of a request for reimbursement, \nunless  the  awarding  agency  “reasonably  believes  the  request  to  be  improper.”  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3);  45  C.F.R.  § 75.305(b)(3).  Allowable  payments  may  be  delayed  under  the \nUniform Guidance only where the recipient (i) “has failed to comply with the terms and conditions \nof  the  Federal  award,”  or  (ii) “is  delinquent  in  a  debt  to  the  United  States.”  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(6). Similarly, under HHS regulations, the withholding of allowable payments is \n \n47   @maxdkozlov, X.com (Apr. 18, 2025, 4:24 PM ET), https://perma.cc/A6L3-M43C. \n48   Id. \n49   Belkin & Whyte, Trump Administration Irate at Harvard, supra n.6. \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 27 of 51\n \npermitted only under specific circumstances, including where the recipient “has failed to comply \nwith the project objectives, Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward”; the recipient “is delinquent in a debt to the United States”; or under other specified \ncircumstances. 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(6). If a recipient fails to comply with federal statutes, \nregulations, or the terms and conditions of a federal award, HHS may impose additional conditions \non the funding, which (i) must be imposed with respect to a “specific award,” (ii) do not include \nthe delay of reimbursement, and (iii) may be imposed only with notice to the recipient, justification \nfor the additional conditions, and an explanation of the “nature of the action needed to remove” \nthem. 45 C.F.R. § 75.207 (emphases added); see also 45 C.F.R. § 75.371. Only if and when the \nHHS  entity  “determines  that  noncompliance  cannot  be  remedied  by  imposing  additional \nconditions”  may  HHS  withhold  payments.  45  C.F.R.  § 75.371.  Importantly,  any  “payment \nwithheld for failure to comply with Federal award conditions, but without suspension of the \nFederal award, must be released to the [recipient] upon subsequent compliance.” 45 C.F.R. \n§ 75.305(b)(6)(iii). \n80.  HHS has not notified Harvard of, or provided any justification for, the imposition \nof any additional conditions on any specific grants. HHS has not made any specific determinations \nthat  any  alleged  noncompliance  cannot  be  remedied,  and  HHS  has  not  given  Harvard  the \nopportunity to remedy any supposed noncompliance. Nothing in the Uniform Guidance, HHS \nregulations, or NIH Grants Policy Statement contemplates such a sweeping, unilateral, unjustified \nadverse action. \n81.  Unless and until the Freeze Order is dissolved, Harvard will suffer widespread \ndisruption of its research operations, with Harvard—and those faculty, staff, and students whose \nsalaries are supported by the frozen funding—not knowing when, or if, funding will resume. This \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 28 of 51\n \ndisruption threatens the integrity and continuity of ongoing research studies supported by the \nfrozen funding, as well as their future viability. At this point, for example, Harvard does not know \nwhether to end employment of anyone whose salary was supported by the frozen funding. Nor \ndoes it know whether to expend funds to continue to retain such items as cell cultures and other \nliving and perishable materials used in research or to continue maintenance of research supplies \nand equipment tied to the frozen funding. \nConsequences of the Freeze Order \n82.  The effect of Defendants’ Freeze Order is to eliminate billions of dollars for \nHarvard’s federally funded research. Over time, the school will be forced to either reduce or halt \nongoing research projects mid-stream and terminate employment contracts with researchers, staff, \nand administrators, or to make other cuts to departments or programs.  \n83.  If Harvard continues to replace the frozen funding from its own resources, it will \nbe forced to reduce the number of graduate students it admits and the number of faculty and \nresearch staff it pays to conduct research. It will be unable to continue procuring and maintaining \ncutting-edge supplies, equipment, and facilities for research. Without the federal funding at issue, \nHarvard would need to operate at a significantly reduced level. And Harvard’s overall reputation \nas a premier research institution will suffer, compromising its ability to recruit and retain talent, \nsecure future funding, and maintain its relationships with other institutions. \n84.  Harvard is one of Massachusetts’ largest employers. Consequently, the Freeze \nOrder will also cause economic harm to the Boston area and the Commonwealth. And the impact \nwill be felt in other states as well. As a recipient of federal research funding, Harvard issues \nsubawards to institutions across America, including St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, the \nUniversity of Alabama, and Baylor College of Medicine.  \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 29 of 51\n \n85.  Harvard frequently collaborates with state and local partners on regional initiatives \nto fuel spending in the local economy. The freeze will reduce, delay, or eliminate much of this \nactivity.  \n86.  The freeze and the looming threat of additional funding cuts will chill Harvard’s \nexercise of its First Amendment rights. Harvard will be unable to make decisions regarding its \nfaculty hiring, academic programs, student admissions, and other core academic matters without \nfear that those decisions will run afoul of government censors’ views on acceptable levels of \nideological or viewpoint diversity on campus. \n87.  Notably, the Freeze Order is part of a broader effort by the Government to punish \nHarvard for protecting its constitutional rights. In the days since Harvard’s April 14 letter and \nstatement, the Government has launched multiple investigations and other actions against Harvard. \nOn April 16, 2025, for example, DHS threatened Harvard’s eligibility to enroll international \nstudents.50 On April 17, 2025, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform \nannounced an investigation into Harvard.51 Also on April 17, 2025, the Department of Education \nsent a records request to Harvard.52 And multiple news outlets have reported that the Internal \n \n50   Samuel A.

The freeze also will adversely affect the broader landscape of American scientific \nand medical research and economic innovation by undermining critical research initiatives and \ninterrupting ongoing scientific and other research. By halting the flow of federal funding, the freeze \ncreates a ripple effect extending beyond Harvard’s campus by stifling job creation in the research \nsector across the nation, reducing intellectual property development, and delaying scientific and \nmedical advances that boost the national economy and improve patient care. The economic \nimplications are substantial, as each suspended research project hinders the cultivation of the \nscientific talent that drives the United States’ global competitiveness in research and development. \nAs President Garber put it, “[f]or the government to retreat from these partnerships now risks not \nonly the health and well-being of millions of individuals, but also the economic security and \nvitality of our nation.”54 These harms are irreparable absent judicial intervention. \nCLAIMS \nCOUNT 1 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n89.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n90.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), a court shall “hold unlawful and \nset aside agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n \n53   Dhruv T.

The Government threatened Harvard’s federal funding unless Harvard restructured \nits internal governance, changed its hiring and admissions practices to strike Defendants’ preferred \nbalance of viewpoints, and modified what it teaches its students to align with Defendants’ views. \nFor example, the demands required Harvard to modify its hiring and admissions practices to \nachieve a particular balance of viewpoints in every “department,” “field,” and “teaching unit.” Ex. \nA at 3. In other words, the Government wielded the threat of withholding federal funds in an \nattempt to coerce Harvard to conform with the Government’s preferred mix of viewpoints and \nideologies. Defendants sent Harvard the April 11 Letter and, when Harvard refused the demands, \nordered the freeze of billions of dollars in federal funding.  \n92.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes final agency action because it “mark[s] the \n‘consummation’  of  the . . . decisionmaking  process”  and  it  “determine[s]”  the  “rights  [and] \nobligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177-78 (1997) (citations omitted). \n93.  The  First  Amendment  provides  that  the  federal  Government  “shall  make  no \nlaw . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n94.  “[A]cademic freedom” is “a special concern of the First Amendment” and receives \nheightened protection. Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967). \n95.  This freedom protects “not only students and teachers, but their host institutions as \nwell.” Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d at 8 (citation omitted). As the Supreme Court has recognized, \n“[a]cademic freedom thrives not only on the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among \nteachers and students, but also . . . on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself.” Regents \nof Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226 n.12 (1985) (citations omitted). Colleges and \nuniversities have a constitutionally protected right to “manage an academic community and \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 32 of 51\n \nevaluate teaching and scholarship free from [governmental] interference.” Blasdel v. Nw. Univ., \n687 F.3d 813, 816 (7th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). After all, “[i]f there is any fixed star in our \nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox \nin politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word \nor act their faith therein.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). \n96.  A “funding condition” that seeks to curtail academic freedom can therefore “result \nin an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open \nSoc’y Int’l, Inc. (“AID”), 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013). The Government “may not deny a benefit to \na person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests.” Perry v. Sindermann, \n408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). Nor may the Government threaten “a third party ‘to achieve the \nsuppression’ of disfavored speech.” Vullo, 602 U.S. at 180-81, 188-91. The Government also \ncannot mandate its own preferred balance of viewpoints. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo, 418 \nU.S. 241, 256-58 (1974). “On the spectrum of dangers to free expression, there are few greater \nthan allowing the government to change the speech of private actors in order to achieve its own \nconception of speech nirvana.” Moody, 603 U.S. at 741-42. \n97.  The  Government’s  demands  on  Harvard  cut  at  the  core  of  Harvard’s \nconstitutionally protected academic freedom because they seek to assert governmental control over \nHarvard’s research, academic programs, community, and governance.55 And they bear no relation \nto Harvard’s federal funding. See AID, 570 U.S. at 214-15 (Government may not “leverage funding \nto regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself”). The Government’s demands seek \nto overhaul Harvard’s governance, control Harvard’s faculty hiring, and dictate what faculty may \n \n55   See,  e.g.,  Eugene  Volokh,  “The  Trump  Administration’s  Unconstitutional  Hate  Mail  to \nHarvard,” by Prof. Genevieve Lakier (Chicago), Reason (Apr. 6, 2025), https://perma.cc/K3W6-\nLB94. \n  31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 33 of 51\n \nteach Harvard students. Put simply, the conditions seek to supplant Harvard’s “autonomous \ndecisionmaking.” Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226 n.12. \n98.  Restrictions on Harvard’s programs violate the First Amendment by seeking to \nrestrict what Harvard’s faculty may teach students. See Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d at 8 (recognizing \na “zone of First Amendment protection for the educational process itself” (citation omitted)). The \n“classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas’” that the First \nAmendment is designed to safeguard. Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81 (1972). \n99.  Restrictions on whom Harvard may hire also violate the First Amendment. It is \nHarvard’s—not the Government’s—“prerogative ‘to determine for itself on academic grounds \nwho may teach,’” and this discretion “is an important part of our long tradition of academic \nfreedom.” Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 47 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  \n100.  Further,  the  Government’s  requirement  that  Harvard  modify  its  hiring  and \nadmissions practices to achieve the Government’s preferred balance of viewpoints in every \n“department,” “field,” and “teaching unit,” Ex. A at 3-4,56 regulates the “recipient” and is far \n“‘outside the scope of the federally funded program[s]’” for medical, scientific, and other research, \nAID, 570 U.S. at 218 (citation omitted). Although Harvard recognizes the importance of viewpoint \ndiversity and the need to promote it,57 the First Amendment makes clear that the authority to \nachieve that objective rests with the University rather than the Government. \n \n56   See  @realDonaldTrump,  Truth  Social  (Apr.  16,  2025,  6:05  AM), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yww6nfw7 (“Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and \n‘birdbrains’  who  are  only  capable  of  teaching  FAILURE  to  students  and  so-called  ‘future \nleaders.’”) \n57   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2 (“As we defend Harvard, we \nwill continue to . . . broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community.”). \n  32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 34 of 51\n \n101.  Likewise, the Government lacks authority to dictate which student groups Harvard \nmay recognize and fund. The Government “may not interfere with private actors’ speech to \nadvance its own vision of ideological balance.” Moody, 603 U.S. at 741. \n102.  Restrictions on Harvard’s ability to manage its own internal leadership likewise \nviolate the First Amendment because leadership decisions shape how the University speaks and \nacts. Those decisions are at the core of the “autonomous decisionmaking” and independent \nmanagement needed to maintain “[a]cademic freedom.” Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226 n.12; see Blasdel, \n687 F.3d at 816 (universities have First Amendment right to “manage an academic community” \n(citation omitted)).  \n103.  Defendants’ April 3 and April 11 Letters target academic content that Harvard \nprofessors “teach students.” Ex. I at 3; see Ex. A at 3-5. That too is unlawful. E.g., Santa Cruz \nLesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. 3d 521, 542-43 (N.D. Cal. 2020) (preliminarily \nenjoining executive order that “appear[ed] to require universities that accept federal grants to \ncurtail promotion of [certain] concepts through teaching”). \n104.  Defendants’ Freeze Order also violates the First Amendment because it is direct \nretaliation for Harvard’s April 14 letter and statement refusing to comply with the Government’s \ndemands. The First Amendment “prohibits government officials from subjecting an [entity] to \nretaliatory actions for engaging in protected speech.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 398 (2019) \n(cleaned up). To succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must “prove that \n(1) [it] engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, (2) [it] was subjected to an adverse action \nby the defendant, and (3) the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the \nadverse action.” D.B. ex rel. Elizabeth B. v. Esposito, 675 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 2012); see Hartman \nv. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 260-61 (2006) (similar). \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 35 of 51\n \n105.  Harvard engaged in constitutionally protected conduct when it refused to comply \nwith the Government’s demands and announced that decision in its April 14 letter and statement. \nJust hours later, Defendants subjected Harvard to adverse action by freezing $2.2 billion in multi-\nyear grants and $60 million in multi-year contracts previously awarded to Harvard. Harvard’s \nprotected conduct was a substantial and motivating factor for the freeze. In particular, Defendants \nannounced the freeze because Harvard refused to comply with the demands and because Harvard \nissued the April 14 letter and statement. The causal link between Defendants’ retaliatory motive \nand Defendants’ adverse action is evident from, among other things: the minuscule amount of time \nthat elapsed between Harvard’s April 11 letter and statement and the freeze (only a few hours); \nDefendants’ striking deviation from the procedures that govern funding suspensions under Title \nVI (see infra Count 3); and Defendants’ previous threats to pull funding if Harvard refused to \ncomply with the demands (including on March 31, April 3, and April 11).  \n106.  Defendants’ Freeze Order and attendant conditions on Harvard’s federal funding \ntrigger strict scrutiny because they seek to leverage Harvard’s federal funding to indirectly infringe \nHarvard’s constitutionally protected academic freedom.  \n107.  Defendants’ Freeze Order and attendant conditions also trigger strict scrutiny \nbecause they are speaker-, content-, and viewpoint-based. The conditions expressly apply to \nHarvard only; they apply because of the “ideological” conditions at Harvard, Ex. A at 2; and they \nspecify  exactly  how  Harvard  should  exercise  its  constitutionally  protected  autonomous \ndecisionmaking.  Unless  Harvard  does  exactly  what  the  Government  wants  in  the  way  the \nGovernment wants and achieves the precise balance of viewpoints the Government wants, Harvard \nstands to lose billions of dollars in federal funding. \n  34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 36 of 51\n \n108.  Where, as here, “the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden \nof proving the constitutionality of its actions.” FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 305 (2022) (citation \nomitted).  \n109.  Defendants cannot reasonably argue that the conditions they seek to impose on \nHarvard are “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling [governmental] interest.” Ams. \nfor Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 607 (2021) (citation omitted). \n110.  The conditions are overbroad because they seek to impose a massive consequence \nunless an enormous amount of constitutionally protected academic freedom is curtailed. And that \ncurtailment is not sufficiently related to the Government’s previously-identified concerns about \nantisemitism. \n111.  The conditions are also overbroad because Defendants have ignored less restrictive \nalternatives. For example, the Government has not explained why it could not have worked with \nHarvard in a voluntary manner, as Title VI and regulations require, prior to freezing funding \nentirely. And even if a freeze were warranted, which it is not, the Government has not explained \nwhy a more targeted reduction, tailored to the programs and purported discrimination at issue, \nwould have been insufficient to achieve its objectives. \n112.  The conditions are further overbroad because they will chill a wide swath of \nprotected speech. The “government [cannot] proscribe unprotected [speech] through a regulation \nthat simultaneously encompasses a substantial amount of protected [speech].” Seals v. McBee, 898 \nF.3d 587, 596 (5th Cir. 2018). \n113.  Harvard  also  has  a  reasonable  fear  that  Defendants  will  terminate  or  freeze \nadditional federal funding, as they have threatened to do. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, \n573 U.S. 149, 165-66 (2014).  \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 37 of 51\n \n114.  For these reasons, this Court should declare Defendants’ actions unlawful and \nenjoin Defendants from engaging in future terminations, suspensions, or refusals to grant or to \ncontinue funding or work pursuant to the Freeze Order. \n115.  Defendants’ actions must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n116.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \nCOUNT 2 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(EQUITABLE CAUSE OF ACTION — ULTRA VIRES) \n117.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n118.  Even if the prerequisites of review under the Administrative Procedure Act were \nnot satisfied, federal courts have the “equitable power[]” to “enjoin unconstitutional actions by \nstate and federal officers.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327-28 (2015); \nsee also R.I. Dep’t of Env’t. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2002) (“district \ncourt[s]” retain the “nonstatutory” power “to review agency action that is ultra vires” and provide \nequitable relief unless Congress precludes that review). \n119.  As alleged in Count 1, Defendants’ demands that Harvard restructure its internal \ngovernance, change its hiring and admissions practices, and modify what it teaches its students to \nalign with Defendants’ views, or else lose federal funding, violate the First Amendment. The \nConstitution forecloses any lawful authority for Defendants’ actions.  \n120.  Because Defendants’ actions in imposing viewpoint-based conditions on Harvard’s \nfunding and terminating funding agreements violate the First Amendment, those actions lack \nlawful authority. This Court should declare them unconstitutional and ultra vires.  \n121.  Because Defendants’ actions are unconstitutional and ultra vires, this Court should \n  36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 38 of 51\n \nenjoin Defendants in their official capacities from imposing the freeze.  \n122.  If  Defendants’  actions  are  not  declared  unlawful,  set  aside,  and  enjoined  as \nunconstitutional and ultra vires, Harvard will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT 3 \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY (VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1) \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n123.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n124.  The APA provides that a court must “hold unlawful and set aside” final agency \naction that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n125.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n126.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes final agency action because it “mark[s] the \n‘consummation’  of  the . . . decisionmaking  process”  and  it  “determine[s]”  the  “rights  [and] \nobligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 \n(citations omitted).  \n127.  Defendants imposed the freeze because of alleged antisemitism on Harvard’s \ncampus. Antisemitism at Harvard was the reason given by the federal Government for threatening \nfederal funding in the March 31, April 3, and April 11 Letters, and in the Freeze Order itself. \n128.  This basis for freezing federal financial assistance falls within Title VI. Title VI \nprohibits discrimination on the basis of “race, color, or national origin” in programs and activities \nreceiving federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Both the judicial and executive branches \nhave interpreted discrimination against Jews as discrimination based on race or shared ancestry \ncovered under Title VI. See, e.g., Bachman v. St. Monica’s Congregation, 902 F.2d 1259, 1261 \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 39 of 51\n \n(7th Cir. 1990); Exec. Order No. 13,899, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,779 (Dec. 11, 2019) (“It shall be the \npolicy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of discrimination rooted \nin anti-Semitism.”).  \n129.  Title  VI  delineates  specific  procedures  that  an  agency  must  follow  to \n“terminat[e] . . . or refus[e] to grant or to continue assistance” based upon alleged violations of \nTitle VI. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. Defendants have ordered the freeze of Harvard’s federal financial \nassistance without following these mandatory procedures.  \n130.  Defendants did not advise Harvard of any failure to comply with a requirement \nimposed by Section 2000d-1. \n131.  Defendants did not provide Harvard with any opportunity to comply by voluntary \nmeans before freezing federal financial assistance.  \n132.  Defendants did not afford Harvard an opportunity for a hearing before freezing \nfederal financial assistance. \n133.  Defendants did not make an express finding on the record after any such hearing \nbefore freezing federal financial assistance. \n134.  Defendants did not submit a written report to the appropriate House and Senate \ncommittees thirty days before freezing federal financial assistance.  \n135.  Rather, Defendants are purporting to immediately freeze funds. That is, whereas \nCongress specified that Defendants must follow the delineated statutory procedures first and freeze \nresearch funding after (and then only as a last resort), here Defendants have done the precise \nopposite: they issued a Freeze Order on research funding first (with no process or opportunity for \nvoluntary compliance) and used that freeze as leverage to negotiate. Such action is flatly unlawful \nand contrary to statutory authority.  \n  38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 40 of 51\n \n136.  What is more, Title VI does not permit wholesale freezing of a recipient’s federal \nfinancial assistance. Instead, it requires that a “refusal to grant or to continue assistance” be \n“limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which . . . noncompliance has \nbeen so found.” Id. (emphasis added). Defendants have made no finding of noncompliance within \nthe various research programs that are subject to the Freeze Order. \n137.  Further, Defendants’ actions offer no explanation of how any alleged violation is \nconnected to the freeze. That explanation is necessary to determine whether the freeze affected \nonly particular programs or parts of programs where alleged violations purportedly exist.  \n138.  Defendants’  April  3  Letter  also  mentioned  unspecified  “alleged  violations \nof . . . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” But Title VII does not authorize administrative \nenforcement through a funding freeze. And Defendants do not have the requisite authority to \nenforce Title VII here. Instead, Title VII establishes a judicial enforcement scheme centered on \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the courts. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)-(g). \n139.  For these reasons, this Court should declare that Defendants’ actions are “in excess \nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); set those actions aside; \nand enjoin Defendants and their agents, employees, and all persons acting under their direction or \ncontrol from taking any action as to Harvard, including by terminating, freezing, or refusing to \ngrant or to continue Harvard’s federal funding. \n140.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective date of the freeze. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 705. \n141.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial irreparable injury.  \n  39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 41 of 51\n \nCOUNT 4 \nFAILURE TO FOLLOW DEFENDANTS’ OWN REGULATORY PROCEDURES \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n \n142.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs.  \n143.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action that \nis “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or that is “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law,” id. § 706(2)(D). \n144.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n145.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes final agency action because it “mark[s] the \n‘consummation’  of  the . . . decisionmaking  process”  and  it  “determine[s]”  the  “rights  [and] \nobligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 \n(citations omitted).  \n146.

Defendants’ regulations require them to follow specific procedures for freezing \nfederal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.2 (HHS \nand NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.1 (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.1 (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.1 (Energy); 34 \nC.F.R. § 100.2 (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.203 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.103 (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. \n§ 1250.101 (NASA). \n148.  Defendants failed to comply with their own regulations before freezing Harvard’s \nfederal financial assistance. \n149.  Defendants’ regulations require them to provide notice before freezing federal \nfinancial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and \n  40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 42 of 51\n \nNIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(1) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.89-9(c)(1) \n(Energy);  34  C.F.R.  § 100.8(c)  (Education);  41  C.F.R.  § 101-6.211-3  (GSA);  28  C.F.R. \n§ 42.108(c)(1) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA). \n150.  Defendants  did  not  provide  the  required  notice  to  Harvard  before  freezing \nHarvard’s federal financial assistance. \n151.  Defendants’  regulations  require  them  to  attempt  to  secure  compliance  “by \nvoluntary means” before freezing federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title \nVI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(1) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) \n(DoD);  34  C.F.R.  § 100.8(c)  (Education);  41  C.F.R.  § 101-6.211-3  (GSA);  28  C.F.R. \n§ 42.108(c)(1) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); see 10 C.F.R. § 1040.89-9(c)(1) (Energy) \n(similar). \n152.  Defendants did not lawfully attempt to secure compliance by voluntary means \nbefore freezing Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n153.  Defendants’ regulations require them to provide an “opportunity for hearing” \nbefore freezing federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. \n§ 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(2) (NSF); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 \nC.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c)(2) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); \nsee  32  C.F.R.  § 195.9(c)  (DoD)  (“opportunity  for  a  hearing”);  10  C.F.R.  § 1040.89-9(a)(1) \n(Energy) (same). Defendants’ regulations require them to hold hearings before a specific agency \nofficial or a “hearing examiner” in accordance with specific, formal procedures that Defendants \nhave promulgated. 45 C.F.R. § 80.9(b) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.9(b) (NSF); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 100.9(b) (Education); 32 C.F.R. § 195.10(b) (DoD); 28 C.F.R. § 42.109(b) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 43 of 51\n \n§ 1250.108(b) (NASA); see 10 C.F.R. §§ 1040.121 to 1040.124 (listing Energy’s procedures); 41 \nC.F.R. §§ 101-6.212-1 to 101-6.212-5 (listing GSA’s procedures).  \n154.  Defendants did not provide Harvard an opportunity for a hearing before freezing \nHarvard’s federal financial assistance, nor did they comply with any of the formal procedural \nrequirements for such a hearing set out in their regulations. \n155.  Defendants’ regulations require them to make “an express finding on the record” \nbefore freezing Harvard’s federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., \n45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(2) (NSF); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.114(c) \n(Energy);  34  C.F.R.  § 100.8(c)  (Education);  41  C.F.R.  § 101-6.211-3  (GSA);  28  C.F.R. \n§ 42.108(c)(2) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); see 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD) (similar). \n156.  Defendants did not make express findings on the record before freezing Harvard’s \nfederal financial assistance. \n157.  Defendants’ regulations require them to “file[] with the committee of the House \nand the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full \nwritten report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action” before freezing Harvard’s \nfederal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS \nand NIH); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) \n(DoD);  28  C.F.R.  § 42.108(c)(4)  (DOJ);  14  C.F.R.  § 1250.107(c)  (NASA);  see  45  C.F.R. \n§ 611.8(c)(4) (NSF) (similar); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.114(e) (Energy) (similar). \n158.  Defendants did not file full written reports in the House and Senate before freezing \nHarvard’s federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. \n159.  Defendants’ regulations prohibit them from freezing federal financial assistance \nbased on alleged violations of Title VI at any time before “the expiration of 30 days after” filing \n  42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 44 of 51\n \nreports in the House and Senate.

Defendants froze Harvard’s federal financial assistance before the expiration of 30 \ndays after filing reports in the House and Senate.  \n161.  Defendants’ regulations require that any freeze of federal financial assistance based \non alleged violations of Title VI “shall be limited in its effect to the particular program, or part \nthereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and \nNIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); \n41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); \nsee 10 C.F.R. § 1040.114(e) (Energy) (similar). \n162.  Defendants froze Harvard’s federal financial assistance without limiting the effect \nof this action to any particular program or part thereof. \n163.  Defendants’ regulations require them to follow specific procedures if they seek to \n“effect compliance” with Title VI using “any other means authorized by law.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) \n(HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(d) (NSF); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(d) \n(Education); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA); see 32 C.F.R. \n§ 195.9(d) (DoD) (similar); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-4 (GSA) (similar). \n164.  Defendants did not attempt to effect compliance with Title VI using any means \nother than immediately freezing Harvard’s federal financial assistance.  \n165.  Instead, Defendants sought to “effect compliance” with Title VI only by “means” \nof a freeze. Because they did so, their own regulations require them to follow all of the procedures \n  43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 45 of 51\n \njust discussed—including voluntary compliance, notice, hearing, findings on the record, and a \nreport to Congress. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8 (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8 (NSF); 32 C.F.R. \n§ 195.9 (DoD); 10 C.F.R. §§ 1040.89-9, 1040.114-.115 (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8 (Education); \n41 C.F.R. §§ 101-6.211-3 to -4 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108 (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107 (NASA). \n166.  Even if Defendants had attempted to “effect compliance” with Title VI using “other \nmeans authorized by law,” Defendants failed to comply with the specific procedures that their own \nregulations require in connection with those “other means.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) (HHS and NIH); \n45 C.F.R. § 611.8(d) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(d) (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy); 34 \nC.F.R. § 100.8(d) (Education); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA); \nsee 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-4 (GSA) (similar). \n167.  Specifically, Defendants failed to attempt to secure compliance by “voluntary \nmeans,” failed to notify Harvard “of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken,” took action \nbefore “the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice,” and failed to make \n“additional efforts . . . to persuade [Harvard] to comply with the regulation and to take such \ncorrective action as may be appropriate.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) (HHS and NIH); see 45 C.F.R. \n§ 611.8(d) (NSF) (similar); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(d) (DoD) (similar); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy) \n(similar); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(d) (Education) (similar); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-4 (GSA) (similar); 28 \nC.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ) (similar); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA) (similar).  \n168.  The March 31, April 3, and April 11 Letters do not constitute efforts at voluntary \ncompliance. Not one of the letters identified a Title VI violation or a specific measure Harvard \ncould take to rectify the alleged violation. Instead, the letters varied significantly from one another \nin their threats and identified areas for reform.  \n  44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 46 of 51\n \n169.  Defendants’  actions  also  further  violate  the  Uniform  Guidance,  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3), (6), as implemented by the relevant agencies. For example, HHS regulations \nimplementing the Uniform Guidance require payment under active grants within 30 days. 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(3). Delay is permissible only under certain circumstances \ndelineated in the applicable regulations and only after notice and an opportunity to cure. 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(6); 45 C.F.R. § 75.207; 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(6). Defendants have provided no \nnotice and no opportunity to cure.  \n170.  Defendants’ actions must be declared unlawful, vacated and “set aside” under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D), and enjoined. \n171.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective date of the freeze. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 705. \n172.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \nCOUNT 5 \nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AGENCY ACTION \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n173.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n174.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n175.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes “[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” \nunder 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n176.  Defendants’ Freeze Order constitutes final agency action because it “mark[s] the \n‘consummation’  of  the . . . decisionmaking  process”  and  it  “determine[s]”  the  “rights  [and] \n  45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 47 of 51\n \nobligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” Bennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 \n(citations omitted).  \n177.  Defendants’  actions  are  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  they  are  neither \n“reasonable  [nor]  reasonably  explained.”  Ohio  v.  EPA,  603  U.S.  279,  292  (2024)  (citation \nomitted). They are not the product of “reasoned decisionmaking.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 52 (1983).  \n178.  Defendants’  actions  “entirely  fail[]  to  consider . . . important  aspect[s]  of  the \nproblem.” Id. at 43; see also DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020). They \nignore the significant consequences the freeze will have on researchers, the University, and the \npublic.  \n179.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious because Defendants failed to \n“articulate  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  [their]  action[s]”  and  demonstrated  no  “rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citation \nomitted). Defendants have articulated no rational nexus between combatting antisemitism and the \nmedical, scientific, and other research funding at hand. Defendants’ actions are unreasoned and \nunexplained. \n180.  Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because they neglected to \n“take[] into account” the “serious reliance interests” that the awards of funding “engendered.” \nRegents of the Univ. of Calif., 591 U.S. at 30 (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \nU.S. 211, 222 (2016)).  For decades, Harvard has relied on the well-established process for federal \nfinancial assistance in its budgeting and financial planning, including with respect to staffing, \ninfrastructure, facility and equipment purchases, and long-term investment decisions. \n  46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 48 of 51\n \n181.  Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because they failed to consider \nreasonable, obvious alternatives to an en masse freeze of Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \nSee Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. v. FCC, 794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  \n182.  For these reasons and others, Defendants’ actions should be declared unlawful; \nvacated and “set aside” as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); and enjoined. \n183.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective date of the freeze. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 705. \n184.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT 6 \nVIOLATION OF STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY \n(EQUITABLE CAUSE OF ACTION — ULTRA VIRES) \n185.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n186.  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is \nthe creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive \naction,  tracing  back  to  England.”  Armstrong,  575  U.S.  at  327.  Accordingly,  even  if  the \nprerequisites of review under the APA were not satisfied, federal “district court[s]” retain the \n“nonstatutory” power “to review agency action that is ultra vires” and provide equitable relief \nunless Congress precludes that review. R.I. Dep’t of Env’t Mgmt., 304 F.3d at 42-43. Congress has \nnot precluded non-statutory judicial review of this agency action. \n187.  As alleged in Count 3, Defendants have no statutory authority to make an end run \naround the procedures mandated by Congress in Title VI. \n  47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 49 of 51\n \n188.  Defendants also cannot rely on any inherent constitutional authority under Article \nII of the Constitution to terminate or freeze Harvard’s research funding.  \n189.  Congress  has  appropriated  funds  to  support  research  through  federal  funding \nadministered  by  NIH,  NSF,  NASA,  and  other  agencies.  See,  e.g.,  Further  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 656-60 (2024) (appropriating funds for \nNIH research); Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 157-63 (2024) \n(appropriating funds for NSF and NASA research). Because Defendants do not have any inherent \nauthority to terminate or freeze appropriated federal funding to Harvard other than through \nspecified procedures, this Court should declare that their actions are ultra vires. \n190.  Because Defendants’ actions are ultra vires, this Court should enjoin Defendants \nin their official capacities as federal officers from enforcing the freeze.  \n191.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined as ultra \nvires, Harvard will suffer substantial, irreparable injury.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests an order: \na.  expediting the resolution of this action to prevent further harm to Plaintiff; \nb.  declaring  unlawful  Defendants’  Freeze  Order  and  attendant  unconstitutional \nconditions in the April 3 and April 11 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes \nof, or refusals to grant or to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those \nagency actions; \nc.  vacating and setting aside Defendants’ Freeze Order and attendant unconstitutional \nconditions in the April 3 and April 11 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes \nof, or refusals to grant or to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those \nagency actions;  \n  48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 50 of 51\n \nd.  postponing the effectiveness of the Freeze Order and attendant unconstitutional \nconditions in the April 3 and April 11 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes \nof, or refusals to grant or to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those \nagency actions;  \ne.  permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in concert \nor participation with Defendants from implementing, maintaining, or in any way \ngiving effect to the Freeze Order and attendant unconstitutional conditions in the \nApril 3 and April 11 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes of, or refusals \nto grant or to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those agency actions; \nf.  permanently enjoining Defendants from violating Plaintiff’s First Amendment \nrights; \ng.  permanently enjoining Defendants from terminating, freezing, or refusing to grant \nor to continue any federal funding at issue in this case without complying with \nfederal law, including the requirements of Title VI and agency regulations; \nh.  entering judgment in favor of Plaintiff;  \ni.  awarding Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees in accordance with law, \nincluding but not limited to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \nj.  issuing any and all other such relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n   \n  49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 51 of 51\n \n   \nDated: April 21, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n  /s/ Steven P.

Garber \nPresident \nHarvard University \nOffice of the President \nMassachusetts Hall \nCambridge, MA 02138 \n \nPenny Pritzker \nLead Member, Harvard Corporation \nHarvard Corporation \nMassachusetts Hall \nCambridge, MA 02138 \n \nDear Dr. Garber:  \nThe United States has invested in Harvard University’s operations because of the value to the \ncountry of scholarly discovery and academic excellence. But an investment is not an entitlement. It \ndepends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights laws, and it only makes sense if Harvard fosters \nthe kind of environment that produces intellectual creativity and scholarly rigor, both of which are \nantithetical to ideological capture.  \nHarvard has in recent years failed to live up to both the intellectual and civil rights conditions that \njustify federal investment. But we appreciate your expression of commitment to repairing those \nfailures and welcome your collaboration in restoring the University to its promise. We therefore \npresent the below provisions as the basis for an agreement in principle that will maintain Harvard’s \nfinancial relationship with the federal government.  \nIf acceptable to Harvard, this document will constitute an agreement in principle, which the parties \nwill work in good faith to translate into a more thorough, binding settlement agreement. As you will \nsee, this letter incorporates and supersedes the terms of the federal government’s prior letter of April \n3, 2025.  \n●  Governance and leadership reforms. By August 2025, Harvard must make meaningful \ngovernance reform and restructuring to make possible major change consistent with this \nletter, including: fostering clear lines of authority and accountability; empowering tenured \nprofessors and senior leadership, and, from among the tenured professoriate and senior \nleadership, exclusively those most devoted to the scholarly mission of the University and \ncommitted to the changes indicated in this letter; reducing the power held by students and \nuntenured faculty; reducing the power held by faculty (whether tenured or untenured) and \nadministrators more committed to activism than scholarship; and reducing forms of \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 6\ngovernance bloat, duplication, or decentralization that interfere with the possibility of the \nreforms indicated in this letter. \n●  Merit-Based Hiring Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and implement \nmerit-based hiring policies, and cease all preferences based on race, color, religion, sex, or \nnational origin throughout its hiring, promotion, compensation, and related practices among \nfaculty, staff, and leadership. Such adoption and implementation must be durable and \ndemonstrated through structural and personnel changes. All existing and prospective faculty \nshall be reviewed for plagiarism and Harvard’s plagiarism policy consistently enforced. All \nhiring and related data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a \ncomprehensive audit by the federal government during the period in which reforms are \nbeing implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028. \n●  Merit-Based Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must adopt and \nimplement merit-based admissions policies and cease all preferences based on race, color, \nnational origin, or proxies thereof, throughout its undergraduate program, each graduate \nprogram individually, each of its professional schools, and other programs. Such adoption \nand implementation must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel \nchanges. All admissions data shall be shared with the federal government and subjected to a \ncomprehensive audit by the federal government—and non-individualized, statistical \ninformation regarding admissions shall be made available to the public, including \ninformation about rejected and admitted students broken down by race, color, national \norigin, grade point average, and performance on standardized tests—during the period in \nwhich reforms are being implemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028. During \nthis same period, the dean of admissions for each program or school must sign a public \nstatement after each admissions cycle certifying that these rules have been upheld. \n●  International Admissions Reform. By August 2025, the University must reform its \nrecruitment, screening, and admissions of international students to prevent admitting \nstudents hostile to the American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution \nand Declaration of Independence, including students supportive of terrorism or \nanti-Semitism. Harvard will immediately report to federal authorities, including the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and State Department, any foreign student, including \nthose on visas and with green cards, who commits a conduct violation. As above, these \nreforms must be durable and demonstrated through structural and personnel changes; \ncomprehensive throughout all of Harvard’s programs; and, during the reform period, shared \nwith the federal government for audit, shared on a non-individualized basis with the public, \nand certified by deans of admissions. \n●  Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring. By August 2025, the University shall \ncommission an external party, which shall satisfy the federal government as to its \ncompetence and good faith, to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for \nviewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually \nviewpoint diverse. This audit shall begin no later than the summer of 2025 and shall proceed \non a department-by-department, field-by-field, or teaching-unit-by-teaching-unit basis as \nappropriate. The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 6\nthe federal government no later than the end of 2025. Harvard must abolish all criteria, \npreferences, and practices, whether mandatory or optional, throughout its admissions and \nhiring practices, that function as ideological litmus tests. Every department or field found to \nlack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by hiring a critical mass of new faculty within \nthat department or field who will provide viewpoint diversity; every teaching unit found to \nlack viewpoint diversity must be reformed by admitting a critical mass of students who will \nprovide viewpoint diversity. If the review finds that the existing faculty in the relevant \ndepartment or field are not capable of hiring for viewpoint diversity, or that the relevant \nteaching unit is not capable of admitting a critical mass of students with diverse viewpoints, \nhiring or admissions within that department, field, or teaching unit shall be transferred to the \nclosest cognate department, field, or teaching unit that is capable of achieving viewpoint \ndiversity. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to establish viewpoint \ndiversity every year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall \nbe at least until the end of 2028. \n●  Reforming Programs with Egregious Records of Antisemitism or Other Bias. By \nAugust 2025, the University shall commission an external party, which shall satisfy the \nfederal government as to its competence and good faith, to audit those programs and \ndepartments that most fuel antisemitic harassment or reflect ideological capture.  \no  The programs, schools, and centers of concern include but are not limited to the \nDivinity School, Graduate School of Education, School of Public Health, Medical \nSchool, Religion and Public Life Program, FXB Center for Health & Human Rights, \nCenter for Middle Eastern Studies, Carr Center for Human Rights at the Harvard \nKennedy School, Department of Near Eastern Languages and Cultures, and the \nHarvard Law School International Human Rights Clinic.  \no  The report of the external party shall include information as to individual faculty \nmembers who discriminated against Jewish or Israeli students or incited students to \nviolate Harvard’s rules following October 7, and the University and federal \ngovernment will cooperate to determine appropriate sanctions for those faculty \nmembers within the bounds of academic freedom and the First Amendment. \no  The report of the external party shall be submitted to University leadership and the \nfederal government no later than the end of 2025 and reforms undertaken to repair \nthe problems. This audit shall be performed and the same steps taken to make repairs \nevery year during the period in which reforms are being implemented, which shall be \nat least until the end of 2028.  \n●  Discontinuation of DEI. The University must immediately shutter all diversity, equity, and \ninclusion (DEI) programs, offices, committees, positions, and initiatives, under whatever \nname, and stop all DEI-based policies, including DEI-based disciplinary or speech control \npolicies, under whatever name; demonstrate that it has done so to the satisfaction of the \nfederal government; and demonstrate to the satisfaction of the federal government that these \nreforms are durable and effective through structural and personnel changes. By August \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 5 of 6\n2025, the University must submit to the government a report—certified for accuracy—that \nconfirms these reforms.  \n●  Student Discipline Reform and Accountability. Harvard must immediately reform its \nstudent discipline policies and procedures so as to swiftly and transparently enforce its \nexisting disciplinary policies with consistency and impartiality, and without double \nstandards based on identity or ideology. Where those policies are insufficient to prevent the \ndisruption of scholarship, classroom learning and teaching, or other aspects of normal \ncampus life, Harvard must develop and implement disciplinary policies sufficient to prevent \nthose disruptions. This includes but is not limited to the following: \no  Discipline at Harvard must include immediate intervention and stoppage of \ndisruptions or deplatforming, including by the Harvard police when necessary to stop \na disruption or deplatforming; robust enforcement and reinstatement of existing time, \nplace, and manner rules on campus, including ordering the Harvard police to stop \nincidents that violate time, place, and manner rules when necessary; a disciplinary \nprocess housed in one body that is accountable to Harvard’s president or other \ncapstone official; and removing or reforming institutional bodies and practices that \ndelay and obstruct enforcement, including the relevant Administrative Boards and \nFAS Faculty Council. \no  Harvard must adopt a new policy on student groups or clubs that forbids the \nrecognition and funding of, or provision of accommodations to, any student group or \nclub that endorses or promotes criminal activity, illegal violence, or illegal \nharassment; invites non-students onto campus who regularly violate campus rules; or \nacts as a front for a student club that has been banned from campus. The leaders or \norganizers of recognized and unrecognized student groups that violate these policies \nmust be held accountable as a matter of student discipline and made ineligible to \nserve as officers in other recognized student organizations. In the future, funding \ndecisions for student groups or clubs must be made exclusively by a body of \nUniversity faculty accountable to senior University leadership. In particular, Harvard \nmust end support and recognition of those student groups or clubs that engaged in \nanti-Semitic activity since October 7th, 2023, including the Harvard Palestine \nSolidarity Committee, Harvard Graduates Students 4 Palestine, Law Students 4 \nPalestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, and the National Lawyers Guild, and \ndiscipline and render ineligible the officers and active members of those student \norganizations. \no  Harvard must implement a comprehensive mask ban with serious and immediate \npenalties for violation, not less than suspension. \no  Harvard must investigate and carry out meaningful discipline for all violations that \noccurred during the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, including the \nHarvard Business School protest of October 2023, the University Hall sit-in of \nNovember 2023, and the spring encampment of 2024. This must include \npermanently expelling the students involved in the October 18 assault of an Israeli \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048     Document 1-1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 6 of 6\nHarvard Business School student, and suspending students involved in occupying \nuniversity buildings, as warranted by the facts of individual cases. \no  The Harvard president and police chief must publicly clarify that the Harvard \nUniversity Police Department will enforce University rules and the law. Harvard \nmust also commit to cooperating in good faith with law enforcement.  \n●  Whistleblower Reporting and Protections.  The University must immediately establish \nprocedures by which any Harvard affiliate can report noncompliance with the reforms \ndetailed in this letter to both university leadership and the federal government. Any such \nreporter shall be fully protected from any adverse actions for so reporting. \n●  Transparency and Monitoring. The University shall make organizational changes to \nensure full transparency and cooperation with all federal regulators. No later than June 30, \n2025, and every quarter thereafter during the period in which reforms are being \nimplemented, which shall be at least until the end of 2028, the University shall submit to the \nfederal government a report—certified for accuracy—that documents its progress on the \nimplementation of the reforms detailed in this letter. The University must also, to the \nsatisfaction of the federal government, disclose the source and purpose of all foreign funds; \ncooperate with the federal government in a forensic audit of foreign funding sources and \nuses, including how that money was used by Harvard, its agents, and, to the extent available, \nthird parties acting on Harvard’s campus; report all requested immigration and related \ninformation to the United States Department of Homeland Security; and comply with all \nrequirements relating to the SEVIS system. \nWe expect your immediate cooperation in implementing these critical reforms that will enable \nHarvard to return to its original mission of innovative research and academic excellence. \n \n ",

Scientific advancement and the pursuit of knowledge fuel America’s innovation, \neconomic success, and global leadership. The commitment to expanding human understanding is \nfoundational at American universities, including Harvard, the Nation’s oldest institution of higher \nlearning. Since its founding nearly four centuries ago, Harvard’s students, faculty, and researchers \nhave helped identify and solve some of society’s most pressing problems. Those pathbreaking and \nlife-saving advancements are due in part to the longstanding collaboration between universities \nsuch as Harvard and the federal Government dating back to the Second World War. Millions of \nAmericans are healthier and safer as a result. Federal funding has enabled researchers at Harvard \nto develop novel drugs to fight Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, engineer nanofibers to \nprotect servicemembers and first responders, support American astronauts in space, and design an \nartificial intelligence system that can be used to diagnose and treat cancer. \n2.  In recent months, the federal Government has launched a broad attack on the critical \nfunding partnerships that make this invaluable research possible. To date, the Government has—\nwith little warning and even less explanation—slashed billions of dollars in federal funding to \nuniversities across America, including Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Princeton, the University of \nPennsylvania,  and  Northwestern.  This  case  involves  the  Government’s  efforts  to  use  the \nwithholding of federal funding as leverage to gain control of academic decisionmaking at Harvard. \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 3 of 60\n3.  On April 11, 2025, citing concerns of antisemitism and ideological capture, the \nGovernment identified ten conditions Harvard must satisfy to receive federal research funding \nalready committed to by the Government and relied on by Harvard, its researchers, and its affiliates \n(the “April 11 Letter,” attached as Exhibit A). Ex. A at 2, 4. The Government dictated that Harvard \n“reform and restructur[e]” its governance to “reduc[e] the power” of certain students, faculty, and \nadministrators. Id. at 2. It required that Harvard hire a third-party to conduct an “audit” of the \nviewpoints of Harvard’s student body, faculty, and staff. Id. at 3-4. Then, based on the results of \nthis university-wide viewpoint audit, Harvard must “hir[e] a critical mass of new faculty” and \n“admit[] a critical mass of students” to achieve “viewpoint diversity” in “each department, field, \nor teaching unit”—to the Government’s satisfaction as determined in the Government’s sole \ndiscretion. Id. And the Government has demanded that Harvard terminate or reform its academic \n“programs” to the Government’s liking. Id. at 4.  \n4.  All told, the tradeoff put to Harvard and other universities is clear: Allow the \nGovernment to micromanage your academic institution or jeopardize the institution’s ability to \npursue medical breakthroughs, scientific discoveries, and innovative solutions. \n5.  Harvard is committed to “combatting antisemitism, one of the most insidious forms \nof bigotry”1 and to “broaden[ing] the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within [its] community.”2 \nHarvard is actively undertaking structural reforms to do both. And while important steps have been \ntaken, Harvard acknowledges that there is still “much work to do.”3 Harvard also fully recognizes \n \n1   Alan  M.

But, as Harvard made clear in a letter to the Government (attached as Exhibit B), \n“[n]either Harvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal \ngovernment.” Ex. B at 3. In the words of Harvard’s President, Alan M. Garber, “[t]he University \nwill not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights.”4 “No government—\nregardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can teach, whom \nthey can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”5 \n7.  In response to Harvard’s defense of its own constitutional freedoms, the federal \nGovernment announced that it was freezing “$2.2 billion in multiyear grants and $60M in \nmultiyear contract value to Harvard University” (the “April 14 Freeze Order,” attached as Exhibit \nC). Ex. C at 2. Within hours of the April 14 Freeze Order, Harvard began receiving stop work \norders. And the situation is getting worse. On April 20, it was reported that the Government is \n“planning to pull an additional $1 billion of [Harvard]’s funding for health research.”6 On May 5, \nthe Secretary of Education, purporting to speak on behalf of every agency and department, \nannounced an “end of new grants for the University,” and directed that “Harvard should no longer \nseek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will be provided,” and “Harvard will \ncease to be a publicly funded institution” (the “May 5 Letter” or “May 5 Freeze Order,” attached \nas Exhibit D). Ex. D at 3-4. That announcement reiterated the Government’s earlier demands and \n \n4   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2; see also Research Funding, \nHarvard Univ., https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding. \n5   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2. \n6   Douglas Belkin & Liz Essley Whyte, Trump Administration Irate at Harvard, Plans to Pull \nAdditional $1 Billion in Funding, Wall St. J.

Id. at 2. The April 14 Freeze Order and May 5 Freeze Order are collectively \nreferred to herein as the “Freeze Orders.” \n8.  Following in the footsteps of the April 14 and May 5 Freeze Orders, Harvard began, \nstarting on May 6, to receive institution-wide termination notices for various agencies, invoking \nthe earlier April 11 and 14 communications. On May 6, for example, the National Institutes of \nHealth sent Harvard a letter stating that it was terminating all of Harvard’s grant funding from that \nagency based on “the University’s unwillingness to take corrective action or implement necessary \nreforms” and that Harvard’s grant “awards no longer effectuate agency priorities” because of \n“recent  events  at  Harvard  University  involving  antisemitic  action”  and  “Harvard’s  ongoing \ninaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students” (the “May \n6 Letter” or “May 6 NIH Termination Letter,” attached as Exhibit E). Ex. E at 2-3. The letter states \nthat “NIH generally will suspend (rather than immediately terminate) a grant and allow the \nrecipient an opportunity to take appropriate corrective action,” but “no corrective action is possible \nhere.” Id. at 3. \n9.  Similarly, on May 9, the United States Department of Agriculture sent Harvard a \nletter announcing the termination of awards (the “May 9 letter” or “May 9 USDA Termination \nLetter,” attached as Exhibit F).  \n10.  On May 12, other agencies followed suit. Harvard received analogous letters from \nthe United States Department of Energy (the “May 12 Energy Termination Letter,” attached as \nExhibit G), United States Department of Defense (the “May 12 DoD Termination Letter,” attached \nas Exhibit H), the National Science Foundation (the “May 12 NSF Termination Letter,” attached \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 6 of 60\nas Exhibit I), and the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (the “May 12 \nHUD Termination Letter,” attached as Exhibit J)  (collectively, the “May 12 Letters” or “May 12 \nTermination Letters”). And the Department of Education has sent individual grant termination \nnotices.    \n11.  Defendants’ actions are unlawful.  The First  Amendment  does not  permit  the \nGovernment to “interfere with private actors’ speech to advance its own vision of ideological \nbalance,” Moody v. NetChoice, 603 U.S. 707, 741 (2024), nor may the Government “rely[] on the \n‘threat of invoking legal sanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression’ of \ndisfavored speech,” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 189 (2024) (citation omitted). The \nGovernment’s  attempt  to  coerce  and  control  Harvard  disregards  these  fundamental  First \nAmendment  principles,  which  safeguard  Harvard’s  “academic  freedom.”  Asociacion  de \nEducacion Privada de P.R., Inc. v. Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007). A threat such as \nthis to a university’s academic freedom strikes an equal blow to the research conducted and \nresulting advancements made on its campus. \n12.  The Government’s actions flout not just the First Amendment, but also federal laws \nand regulations. The Government has expressly invoked the protections against discrimination \ncontained in Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as a basis for its actions. Make no mistake: \nHarvard rejects antisemitism and discrimination in all of its forms and is actively making structural \nreforms to eradicate antisemitism on campus. But rather than engage with Harvard regarding those \nongoing efforts, the Government announced a sweeping freeze of current and future funding for \nmedical, scientific, technological, and other research that has nothing at all to do with antisemitism \nand Title VI compliance. Moreover, Congress in Title VI set forth detailed procedures that the \nGovernment “shall” satisfy before revoking or refusing to grant or continue federal funding based \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 7 of 60\non discrimination concerns. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. Those procedures effectuate Congress’s desire \nthat “termination of or refusal to grant or to continue” federal financial assistance be a remedy of \nlast resort. Id. The Government made no effort to follow those procedures—nor the procedures \nprovided for in Defendants’ own agency regulations—before freezing Harvard’s federal financial \nassistance. \n13.  These  fatal  procedural  shortcomings  are  compounded  by  the  arbitrary  and \ncapricious nature of Defendants’ abrupt and indiscriminate decision. Even before the freezes and \nterminations, the Government had threatened to terminate up to $8.7 billion in federal funding not \njust to Harvard, but also to preeminent Boston hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, \nBeth Israel Deaconess  Medical Center, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, Boston Children’s \nHospital, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. These hospitals are independent corporate entities \nwith their own boards of directors or trustees and their own separate officers, leadership, and \nmanagement. They are not under Harvard’s control. The hospitals have no control over Harvard’s \nenforcement  of  Title  VI  requirements,  and  vice  versa.  These  hospitals  have  their  own  tax \nidentification numbers, endowments, and accounts. And they seek and receive federal financial \nassistance directly from federal agencies, not through Harvard.  \n14.  The Government has not identified—and cannot identify—any rational connection \nbetween antisemitism concerns and the medical, scientific, technological, and other research it has \nfrozen or terminated that aims to save American lives, foster American success, preserve American \nsecurity,  and  maintain  America’s  position  as  a  global  leader  in  innovation.  Nor  has  the \nGovernment acknowledged the significant consequences that the indefinite freeze and termination \nof billions of dollars in federal research funding will have on Harvard’s research programs, the \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 8 of 60\nbeneficiaries of that research, and the national interest in furthering American innovation and \nprogress.  \n15.  The Government has not characterized any of its actions as a “termination of or \nrefusal to grant or to continue assistance” under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. But the effect of the \nGovernment’s decisions is the same. Under whatever name, the Government has ceased the flow \nof  funds  to  Harvard  as  part  of  its  pressure  campaign  to  force  Harvard  to  submit  to  the \nGovernment’s control over its academic programs. That, in itself, violates Harvard’s constitutional \nrights. But the Government has also failed to engage in the statutorily mandated process Congress \nrequired under Title VI before funds are cut off, which provides independent grounds for declaring \nthe freeze and subsequent termination unlawful. By accepting federal funds, Harvard agreed to \nabide by the provisions in Title VI and the relevant agencies’ corresponding regulations. But \nHarvard’s agreement is not a blank check for agencies to impose the Government’s recent, \nunrelated demands as a condition of continued funding. See Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, \nP.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 219 (2022) (“[T]he legitimacy of Congress’ power to enact Spending \nClause legislation rests . . . on whether the recipient [of federal funds] voluntarily and knowingly \naccepts the terms of that contract,” and “[r]ecipients cannot knowingly accept the deal with the \nFederal Government unless they would clearly understand the obligations that would come along \nwith doing so.” (cleaned up)). \n16.  Defendants’ actions threaten Harvard’s academic independence and place at risk \ncritical lifesaving and pathbreaking research that occurs on its campus. And they are part of a \nbroader effort by the Government to punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights. In the \nmonth since Harvard rejected the Government’s initial demands, the Government has launched \nmultiple investigations and other actions against Harvard. Although the Government has indicated \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 9 of 60\nthat it has made several attempts to contact the University, at no time has it rescinded the draconian \ndemands laid out in the April 11 Letter. Indeed, the Government has only doubled down, reupping \nthe same demands in the May 5 Letter while noting that the “Administration’s priorities have not \nchanged.” Ex. D at 4. Meanwhile, it has only ratcheted up funding cuts, investigations, and threats \nthat will hurt students from every state in the country and around the world, as well as research \nthat improves the lives of millions of Americans. \n17.

Harvard University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States \nand one of the world’s leading research universities. For decades, universities like Harvard have \nconducted research identified by the federal Government as essential to advancing the boundaries \nof human knowledge and improving the lives of Americans. While this partnership traces back to \nour country’s founding, the partnership between the Government and universities grew stronger \nduring  and  after  the  Second  World  War,  as  the  Government  increasingly  recognized  that \nuniversities can help achieve scientific and technological advances that benefit the public.7 \n \n7   Ronald Brownstein, Trump’s Drive Against Top Universities Could Carry a Big Economic \nCost, CNN (Apr. 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/HR4S-5MC2. \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 13 of 60\n43.  Federal funding for university research serves as a cornerstone of the American \nresearch system. It is an essential resource for the groundbreaking discoveries made today by \nHarvard’s faculty and staff, leading not only to scientific advancement and innovation, but also to \nthe country’s economic growth. Today, Harvard’s federally funded research includes particular \nstrengths in oncology, immunology, neuroscience, molecular biology, genomics, quantum science, \nand other areas of technology that support our national economy and defense. \n44.  Harvard’s  researchers,  in  collaboration  with  the  federal  Government,  have \npioneered groundbreaking innovations that make millions of people in our country healthier and \nsafer across a wide range of medical, engineering, scientific, and other fields. Their research \nincludes, for example: \n•  Cancer Research: Harvard’s cancer research includes identifying mechanisms that drive \ndisease development at all stages including tumor metastasis; developing new therapeutic \napproaches with the goal of preventing, targeting and suppressing cancer at every stage; \nmapping the metabolic signaling pathways that drive the association of cancer with other \ndiseases to restore proper cellular function and enhance prevention; and developing a new \nmachine learning method to model the behavior of all 25,000 human genes as they respond \nto high-intensity treatments like chemotherapy, which the National Cancer Institute cited \nas an advancement in basic cancer research that will lay the groundwork for future clinical \nbreakthroughs. \n•  Infectious Diseases Research: Harvard researchers study infectious diseases  to better \nunderstand and address the global threat of multidrug-resistant infections; develop new \ntools for global pandemic prevention; discover new therapeutic antibodies and small \nmolecules to treat or cure viral diseases; and develop enhanced approaches to monitor \ndisease outbreaks and to predict patterns of spread. \n•  Microbiome Research: Harvard’s microbiome research includes developing new frontiers \nin precision medicine that can help individuals reduce their risk of cancer and other \ndiseases by better understanding and leveraging our bodies’ relationship with the multitude \nof bacteria and other microorganisms that contribute to human health and disease. \n•  Toxin Reduction Research: Harvard’s toxin reduction research includes studying the harm \nfrom microplastics on sperm counts and fertility, and developing life-saving guidance for \nthose exposed to high levels of toxins, including firefighters, individuals working in \nenvironments with high exposure potentials (e.g., members of the military, miners, and \nchemical factory workers), and children in rural communities. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 14 of 60\n•  Neurological Research: Harvard’s neurological research includes identifying numerous \nmodifiable risk factors for Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and other neurological \ndiseases including conditions that are generally age-related, such as Alzheimer’s (and \nother forms of dementia) and stroke, which creates the potential to significantly cut disease \nincidence and reduce healthcare costs. Other research involves efforts to better understand \nthe role of infections in seeding neurodegenerative disorders, with important implications \nfor prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. And other research involves studying the long-\nterm neurologic effects of radiation and chemotherapy-based treatment on young children \nwho survived cancer and identifying treatments to improve outcomes that also reduce the \nimpact  of  therapy-related  collateral  damage,  which  is  also  relevant  to  adult  cancer \nsurvivors. \n•  Biotechnology:  Harvard’s  biotechnology  research  includes  studying  how  spaceflight, \nincluding  space-related  radiation,  affects  blood  cell  formation  in  astronauts  on  the \nupcoming Space Station and ARTEMIS missions. That research is also developing a new \nclass  of  anesthetics  that  could  lead  to  breakthroughs  in  the  care  of  wounded \nservicemembers in the field that would obviate the need for trained anesthesiologists or \nhospitalization. And it is advancing organ chip technology to further understanding of, \namong other things, illnesses and injuries that result from high doses of radiation. \n•  Technological  Innovation:  Additional  research  at  Harvard  supports  innovations  in \nquantum computing, artificial intelligence and machine learning, nanomaterials, microchip \ndesign, biomechanics, chemical engineering, next-generation batteries, computer science, \n“smart” living environments for the elderly, and more.  \n•  Other Military Advancements and National Security: Harvard also dedicates research to \nreducing the short- and long-term consequences of traumatic battlefield related injuries; \ndeveloping soft robotics for enhancing battlefield performance; creating compact and \nrapidly deployable (foldable) bridges and other structures for military use; developing \nradiation countermeasures and limb regeneration; and developing hack-resistant computer \nnetworks, rapid infectious agent diagnostics, and ways to combat antibiotic resistance.  \n45.  Federal funding for university research typically flows through a grant process \nadministered by federal agencies. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 241(a)(3) (authorizing NIH to “make \ngrants-in-aid to universities” for research support). As NIH explains, it is “the largest public funder \nof biomedical research in the world,” investing “most of its nearly $48 billion budget in medical \nresearch seeking to enhance life and to reduce illness and disability.”8 Through the appropriations \nprocess, Congress establishes the annual budgets for research-focused federal agencies like NIH, \nNSF,  NASA,  and  others  that  fund  university  research.  See,  e.g.,  Further  Consolidated \n \n8   Grants & Funding, Nat’l Insts. of Health, https://perma.cc/B6CV-TKP7. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 15 of 60\nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 656-60 (2024) (appropriating funds for \nNIH research); Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 157-63 (2024) \n(appropriating funds for NSF and NASA research). These appropriations directly determine how \nmuch money is available to universities and other research institutions for research grants that are \nmost often awarded on a competitive basis. \n46.  Pursuant to Congress’s directives, the federal Government fuels critical research at \nHarvard, which is one of the nation’s leading recipients of NIH grants. Along with investments by \nthe universities themselves, these grants secure the funding necessary to pursue biomedical \nresearch and other research endeavors across the University. Numerous Harvard professors, \nincluding Nobel laureates, rely on NIH and other federal funding for their work.9 Federally funded \nresearch at Harvard has led to life-altering advancements in improving cancer diagnoses.10 It \nsupports brain health and trauma research for veterans.11 And federal funding has supported \nprojects  focused  on  understanding  neurodegenerative  disease  and  creating  a  new  class  of \nantibiotics to treat infections.12 It has also enabled Harvard researchers to study how spaceflight \naffects blood cell formation in astronauts on upcoming missions.13 \n \n9   8 Harvard Medical School Researchers Receive NIH Awards, Harvard Med.

Harvard’s research programs—funded in part by Defendants—serve as training \ngrounds for the next generation of scientific, technological, medical, and public health leaders, \nwith grants supporting the work of thousands of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. \nTitle VI and Federal Financial Assistance \n48.  Title VI provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, \ncolor, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.” \n42  U.S.C.  § 2000d.  Title  VI  permits  an  agency,  under  detailed  conditions,  to  enforce  this \nsubstantive provision by terminating or suspending federal financial assistance. \n49.  If an agency wants to freeze federal financial assistance to universities based on \nalleged civil rights violations under Title VI, then it must follow a detailed and mandatory statutory \nframework. The Supreme Court has referred to these procedural limits as “elaborate restrictions \non agency enforcement.” Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 290 (2001).  \n50.  No action to terminate or refuse to grant or continue federal financial assistance \nmay be taken “until the department or agency concerned has advised the appropriate person or \npersons of the failure to comply with the requirement and has determined that compliance cannot \nbe secured by voluntary means.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1; see Adams v. Richardson, 351 F. Supp. \n636,  641  (D.D.C.  1972)  (“The  underlying  thrust  of  the  statute  requires  that  the  agency \ninvolved . . . attempt at the outset to secure compliance by voluntary means, if such method is \nreasonably possible. This course involves negotiation, and negotiation takes time.”); cf. Mach \nMining, LLC v. EEOC, 575 U.S. 480, 486-89 (2015) (discussing similar procedural requirement \nin Title VII context). \n51.  If the agency determines that voluntary compliance is not possible, then it must \ninitiate formal proceedings, specifically a hearing, and must make express findings on the record \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 17 of 60\nbefore terminating or refusing to grant or to continue federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1; see Washington Legal Found. v. Alexander, 984 F.2d 483, 484 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The \nagency head must file “a full written report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action” \nwith the relevant committees in the House and Senate. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. Further, the action \ndoes not “become effective until thirty days have elapsed after the filing of such report.” Id. \n52.  The agency Defendants’ regulations layer on top of the statutory text of 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000d-1 and provide additional details on procedural requirements for any termination or refusal \nto grant or to continue federal financial assistance based on Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8-.10 \n(HHS); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8 (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-1 to -4 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108 \n(DOJ). These regulations are binding on the agencies that issued them. \n53.  Defendants know and are capable of following these mandatory procedural steps. \nOn the very same day as the April 11 Letter, DOJ’s Civil Rights Division sent Harvard a letter \nannouncing that it was “commencing a compliance review investigation of Harvard University \n[specifically Harvard Medical School] pursuant to Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 \nU.S.C. § 2000d et seq.,” and noting that “[i]f we conclude that Harvard University is violating \nTitle VI, we will inform you and work with you to secure compliance by informal voluntary means. \n28 C.F.R. §§ 42.107 & 42.108.”14 \n \n14   Letter from Harmeet K.

On October 7, 2023, the terrorist organization Hamas conducted a surprise attack \non Israeli citizens, killing and brutalizing thousands of Israelis and Americans and taking more \nthan 240 people hostage.15 This began an ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.16 \n55.  The escalating conflict in the Middle East dominated headlines around the globe. \nIn the United States, protests erupted on university campuses across the country. Like other \nschools, Harvard experienced increased tensions among members of its campus community, \nincluding students.17 Members of the Jewish and Israeli communities at Harvard reported treatment \nthat was vicious and reprehensible.  \n56.  Harvard has made policy and other changes over the last year aimed at ensuring its \ncampus is safe, fair, and welcoming to Jewish and Israeli students. Harvard has adopted new \naccountability procedures and clarified policies; imposed meaningful discipline on those who \nviolate applicable policies; enhanced programs designed to address bias and promote ideological \ndiversity and civil discourse; hired staff to support these programs and support students; and \nenhanced safety and security measures.  \n57.

In August 2024, Harvard issued updated information on Rules for Use of Campus \nSpaces,21 which expressly prohibit, among other things, structures such as tents, unauthorized \nexhibits and displays, and excessive noise.22 \n59.  In September 2024, Harvard released Guidance explaining that online “doxing” \nviolates the University’s prohibition on “intense personal harassment” and constitutes bullying \nunder its Non-Discrimination and Anti-Bullying Policies.23  \n60.  In November 2024, Harvard issued a “Frequently Asked Questions” statement \n(“FAQs”) on “Protests in Libraries” explaining how its Protest and Dissent Guidelines found in \nthe University-wide Statement on Rights and Responsibilities apply to protests in Harvard’s \nlibraries. The FAQs underscore that when a library space is used to “express a shared message,” \n \n18   Statement of Interim President and Deans on University Rights and Responsibilities, Harvard \nUniv.: Off. of the President (Jan. 19, 2024), https://perma.cc/2ND4-HHDV.  \n19   Id.  \n20   Id.  \n21   Rules for Use of Campus Spaces, Harvard Univ.: Off. of the Exec.

Harvard has also made changes to clarify the scope of prohibited conduct aimed at \nJewish  and  Israeli  students.  In  January  2025,  Harvard  committed  to  take  account  of  the \nInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s (“IHRA”) definition of antisemitism in its anti-\nharassment policies and disciplinary proceedings.25 The United States, as a member of IHRA, uses \nthis definition and has encouraged other governmental and international organizations to use it. \nHarvard is one of only a few universities to have adopted the IHRA definition.  \n62.  In March 2025, Harvard released updated “Frequently Asked Questions” clarifying \nthat both Jewish and Israeli identities are covered by the University’s Non-Discrimination and \nAnti-Bullying Policies, that the IHRA definition of antisemitism will be used, and that IHRA \nexamples will be considered in assessing incidents.26 The guidance also made clear that the Non-\nDiscrimination policy applies to conduct targeting Zionists.27 \n63.  Harvard has taken action to enforce these policies in response to campus incidents \nin the current academic year. During the fall 2024 semester, Harvard suspended library access for \ndozens of students and faculty members who violated University policies in connection with \nprotests in Harvard’s college, law school, and divinity school libraries.28 In March 2025, Harvard \n \n24   Frequently  Asked  Questions:  Protests  in  Libraries,  Harvard  Libr.

Well before the Government’s engagement, Harvard had initiated steps to address \nantisemitism on campus. Recognizing the seriousness of this issue, Harvard has taken and will \ncontinue to take steps to do so in the future. \n65.  Concurrently  with  these  changes,  a  Presidential  Task  Force  on  Combating \nAntisemitism (“Harvard Task Force”) was formed on January 19, 2024, by President Garber and \nwas charged with “identifying the root causes of and contributing factors to bias-based behaviors \non campus,” “evaluating evidence regarding the characteristics and frequency of these behaviors,” \nand “recommending approaches to combat bias and to mitigate its impact on campus.”31  \n66.  The Harvard Task Force released its preliminary recommendations on June 6, \n2024.32 The Harvard Task Force observed that, since October 2023, Jewish and Israeli students \n \nSaketh Sundar, HLS Banned 60 Students From Its Library for a ‘Study-In.’ Dozens Just Did It \nAgain, Harvard Crimson (Oct. 25, 2024), https://perma.cc/GH98-8GAJ; Rachael A.

On April 29, 2025, the Harvard Task Force released its full report and detailed \nrecommendations for ongoing reforms to ensure the safety and inclusion of Harvard’s Jewish and \nIsraeli student populations.35 Harvard continues to update and enforce its policies and procedures \nto protect Jewish and Israeli members of the Harvard community while permitting the free and \nopen exchange of ideas.  \nDefendants’ Actions Threatening Harvard’s Federal Research Funding \n68.  On February 3, 2025, DOJ announced the formation of a multi-agency Task Force \nto Combat Antisemitism (“Federal Task Force”) including representatives from the Department of \nEducation, HHS, and other agencies, led by Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for \nCivil Rights, Leo Terrell.36 \n69.  On February 26, 2025, a news article reported Terrell as saying, “When you see \nuniversities start losing millions of dollars in federal funding, you’re going to see a change in their \nbehavior.”37 A few days later, Terrell stated in a Fox Business clip he later shared on X, “I’ve \n \n33   Id. at 1.  \n34   Id. at 1-5.  \n35  Alan M.

Columbia, Harvard, Michigan, UCLA, USC. Let me tell you what we’re \ngoing to do. We’re going to take away your funding.”38 These statements echo earlier comments \nmade by Terrell and President Donald J. Trump. President Trump’s campaign website touted his \nplan  “to  reclaim  our  once  great  educational  institutions  from  the  radical  Left  and  Marxist \nmaniacs,”39 including by threatening to “take the billions and billions of dollars that we will collect \nby taxing, fining, and suing excessively large private university endowments” from “Harvard and \nother once-respected universities.”40 And prior to Terrell’s appointment as Senior Counsel to the \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights and head of the Federal Task Force, he promised that \n“Harvard will lose much more [funding] effective January 2025” because “America will no longer \nfund Jew Hating Schools!”41 \n70.  On February 27, 2025, Harvard received a letter (attached as Exhibit K) from the \nFederal Task Force. That letter requested a meeting “within 30 days with relevant administrators, \nfaculty, staff members, and any on-campus Jewish stakeholder groups” to help the Federal Task \nForce “fully and objectively evaluate the allegations and determine what further action, if any, \nmay be warranted.” Ex. K at 3. \n71.  On February 28, 2025, the Federal Task Force issued a press release (attached as \nExhibit L) announcing its plans to visit ten university campuses, including Harvard, to gather \ninformation about allegations of antisemitic incidents as it considers whether remedial action is \nwarranted. \n \n38   @TheLeoTerrell, X.com (Feb. 28, 2025, 11:48 AM ET), https://perma.cc/5NBW-B6P5.  \n39   Agenda47:  Protecting  Students  from  the  Radical  Left  and  Marxist  Maniacs  Infecting \nEducational Institutions, DonaldJTrump.com (July 17, 2023), https://perma.cc/7VKE-VN89.  \n40   Agenda47:  The  American  Academy,  DonaldJTrump.com  (Nov.  1,  2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/WFL2-Y262.  \n41   @TheLeoTerrell, X.com (Oct. 20, 2024, 3:33 PM ET), https://perma.cc/9WUM-PKHK.  \n  22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 24 of 60\n72.  In the weeks following DOJ’s letter to Harvard requesting a meeting and the \nFederal Task Force’s press release announcing campus visits, Harvard worked with Government \nofficials to schedule an on-campus meeting. A campus visit was scheduled for late April 2025.  \n73.  On March 31, 2025, Harvard received a letter from GSA (the “March 31 Letter,” \nattached as Exhibit M). The March 31 Letter announced a federal review of more than $8.7 billion \nin federal research grants to Harvard and “its affiliates,” Ex. M at 2—an apparent reference to \nBoston-area teaching hospitals and their affiliated professional corporations or group medical \npractices that employ Harvard Medical School faculty, but which are entirely independent entities \nand are not part of Harvard.  \n74.  The March 31 Letter linked the review of funding to Defendants’ allegations about \nantisemitism on Harvard’s campus: Harvard is “being investigated for potential infractions and \ndereliction of duties to curb or combat anti-Semitic harassment.” Id. The cover e-mail (attached as \nExhibit N) transmitting the letter to President Garber further confirmed: “This review is being \nconducted in support of President Trump’s Executive Order, ‘Additional Measures to Combat \nAnti-Semitism.’” Ex. N at 2. And Defendants’ press release announcing the review offered even \nfurther confirmation: the review of funding is “part of an investigation aimed at eliminating anti-\nSemitic harassment on college campuses.”42 The press release referred to a “similar ongoing \n \n42   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Health and Human Servs., HHS, ED, and GSA Initiate Federal \nContract and Grant Review of Harvard University (Mar. 31, 2025), https://tinyurl.com/4nzf3zth \n(cleaned up). \n  23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 25 of 60\nreview of Columbia University,”43 and linked to another press release concerning “ongoing \ninvestigations for potential violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act” at Columbia.44 \n75.  On April 1, 2025, at a private lunch, President Trump proposed canceling all federal \nfunds promised to Harvard. According to an anonymous source, President Trump asked, “What if \nwe never pay them? . . . Wouldn’t that be cool?”45 \n76.  On April 3, 2025, Harvard’s President received another e-mail (attached as Exhibit \nO). The e-mail’s subject line was “Oﬃcial Notice: Task Force to Combat Anti-Semitism Letter of \nDemands to Harvard University.” Ex. O at 2. The e-mail stated: “I am sending you an official \nnotice of pre-conditions your institution must comply with in order to be in good standing and \ncontinue to be the recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.” Id.  \n77.  A letter accompanying the e-mail (the “April 3 Letter,” attached as Exhibit P) \ndescribed “several broad, non-exhaustive areas of reform that the government views as necessary \nfor Harvard to implement to remain a responsible recipient of federal taxpayer dollars.” Ex. P at \n2. The proposed reforms included governance reforms “to foster clear lines of authority”; oversight \nof “biased programs that fuel antisemitism” to “improve viewpoint diversity”; and efforts “to \nshutter” diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) programs that “teach” certain things. Id. at 2-3. \nThe April 3 Letter further stated that Harvard had “failed to protect American students and faculty \nfrom antisemitic violence and harassment in addition to other alleged violations of Title VI and \n \n43   Id. \n44   Press Release, U.S. Gen.

Id. \n78.  On April 11, 2025, HHS, GSA, and the Department of Education sent another letter \nto President Garber. Ex. A. The April 11 Letter, which “incorporates and supersedes” the April 3 \nLetter, similarly laid out a list of conditions to “maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the \nfederal government,” including the following:  \n•  “Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring. . . . [T]he University shall commission \nan external party . . . to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and leadership for viewpoint \ndiversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit must be individually viewpoint \ndiverse. . . . Harvard  must  abolish  all  criteria,  preferences,  and  practices,  whether \nmandatory or optional, throughout its admissions and hiring practices, that function as \nideological litmus tests. Every department or field found to lack viewpoint diversity must \nbe reformed by hiring a critical mass of new faculty within that department or field who \nwill provide viewpoint diversity; every teaching unit found to lack viewpoint diversity must \nbe reformed by admitting a critical mass of students who will provide viewpoint diversity.”  \n \n•  “Governance and leadership reforms. . . . Harvard must make meaningful governance \nreform  and  restructuring  . . .  [including]  empowering  tenured  professors  and  senior \nleadership, and, from among the tenured professoriate and senior leadership, exclusively \nthose most devoted to the scholarly mission of the University and committed to the changes \nindicated in this letter; reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty; [and] \nreducing the power held by faculty (whether tenured or untenured) and administrators \nmore committed to activism than scholarship.” \n \n•  “Discontinuation of DEI. The University must immediately shutter all diversity, equity, \nand  inclusion  (DEI)  programs,  offices,  committees,  positions,  and  initiatives,  under \nwhatever name, and stop all DEI-based policies, including DEI-based disciplinary or \nspeech  control  policies,  under  whatever  name . . . through  structural  and  personnel \nchanges”  and  “demonstrate  that  it  has  done  so  to  the  satisfaction  of  the  federal \ngovernment.” \n \n•  “International Admissions Reform. . . . [T]he University must reform its recruitment, \nscreening, and admissions of international students to prevent admitting students hostile to \nthe American values and institutions inscribed in the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of \nIndependence . . . through structural and personnel changes.” \n \n  25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 27 of 60\n•  “Student Discipline Reform and Accountability. . . . In the future, funding decisions for \nstudent  groups  or  clubs  must  be  made  exclusively  by  a  body  of  University  faculty \naccountable to senior University leadership. In particular, Harvard must end support and \nrecognition of those student groups or clubs that engaged in anti-Semitic activity since \nOctober  7th,  2023,  including  the  Harvard  Palestine  Solidarity  Committee,  Harvard \nGraduates Students 4 Palestine, Law Students 4 Palestine, Students for Justice in Palestine, \nand the National Lawyers Guild, and discipline and render ineligible the officers and active \nmembers of those student organizations.” \n \n•  “Transparency and Monitoring. . . . The University must . . . , to the satisfaction of the \nfederal government, disclose the source and purpose of all foreign funds; cooperate with \nthe federal government in a forensic audit of foreign funding sources and uses, including \nhow that money was used by Harvard, its agents, and . . . third parties acting on Harvard’s \ncampus.” On a quarterly basis through the end of 2028, “the University shall submit to the \nfederal government a report—certified for accuracy—that documents its progress on the \nimplementation of the[se] reforms.” \n \nEx. A at 2-6 (emphases added). \n79.  The  April  11  Letter  stated  the  Government’s  expectation  of  “immediate \ncooperation  in  implementing  these  critical  reforms”  if  the  University  wanted  to  “maintain \nHarvard’s financial relationship with the federal government.” Id. at 2, 6. \n80.  On April 14, 2025, Harvard declined to accede to the Government’s demands. In a \nletter  to  the  Government,  Harvard’s  lawyers  said,  “Neither  Harvard  nor  any  other  private \nuniversity can allow itself to be taken over by the federal government.” Ex. B at 3. Because the \nApril 11 Letter “presents demands that, in contravention of the First Amendment, invade university \nfreedoms long recognized by the Supreme Court,” the response said, “Harvard is not prepared to \nagree to demands that go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration” and “will not \naccept the government’s terms.” Id. at 2-3. \n81.  President  Garber,  in  a  statement  to  the  Harvard  community  that  day,  wrote, \n“Although some of the demands outlined by the government are aimed at combating antisemitism, \n  26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 28 of 60\nthe majority represent direct governmental regulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.”46 \nHe also explained, “No government—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what \nprivate universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry \nthey can pursue.”47  \nDefendants Cut Harvard’s Research Funding \n82.  Just hours after Harvard rejected the Government’s demands for control over its \nacademic enterprise, the Federal Task Force “announc[ed] a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year \ngrants and $60M in multi-year contract value to Harvard University.” Ex. C at 2. The April 14 \nFreeze Order cited “[t]he harassment of Jewish students” and “the troubling entitlement mindset \nthat is endemic in our nation’s most prestigious universities and colleges.” Id.  \n83.  The Government immediately began implementing the April 14 Freeze Order. \nWithin hours, Harvard began receiving stop work orders. \n84.  A few days later, reports surfaced that the Director of NIH’s Office of Policy for \nExtramural Research Administration had informed other officials at NIH that the agency had \n“received confirmation from HHS/IOS to hold off on making awards to schools where the funds \nhave been frozen, i.e., Columbia, Brown, Northwestern, Cornell, Weill-Cornell, Harvard.”48 The \nDirector also noted that “HHS/IOS has stated that we should not provide any communications to \nthese schools about whether or why the funds are frozen.”49 \n \n46   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2. \n47   Id. \n48   @maxdkozlov, X.com (Apr. 18, 2025, 4:24 PM ET), https://perma.cc/A6L3-M43C. \n49   Id. \n  27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 29 of 60\n85.  On April 20, 2025, it was reported that the “Trump administration has grown so \nfurious with Harvard University” that “it is planning to pull an additional $1 billion of the school’s \nfunding for health research.”50 \n86.  On May 2, 2025, President Trump escalated the Government’s demands, posting \non social media: “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they \ndeserve!”51 \n87.  On May 5, 2025, the Secretary of Education sent Harvard another letter, which the \nDepartment of Education publicly released, stating that “Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS \nfrom the federal government, since none will be provided,” that “Harvard will cease to be a \npublicly  funded  institution,”  and  that  “today’s  letter  marks  the  end  of  new  grants  for  the \nUniversity.” Ex. D at 3-4. The May 5 Freeze Order said the action was based, among other things, \non the Government’s assessment of Harvard’s “academic rigor,” admissions requirements and \npractices, grading systems, faculty hiring, and course construction. Id. at 2.52 \n88.  On May 6, 2025, NIH sent Harvard a letter announcing the termination of $2.2 \nbillion53 in awards, invoking 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and stating that Harvard’s grant “awards no \nlonger effectuate agency priorities” because of “recent events at Harvard University involving \nantisemitic action” and “Harvard’s ongoing inaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment \n \n50 Belkin & Whyte, Trump Administration Irate at Harvard, supra n.6. \n51 @realDonaldTrump, Truth Social (May 2, 2025, 7:25 AM), https://tinyurl.com/35wu7kpk. \n52 As of the filing of this Complaint, the Government agreed to also include, in the Administrative \nRecord that will be filed on May 19, 2025, all non-privileged documents directly or indirectly \nconsidered in issuing the May 5 Letter, the May 6 Letter, the May 9 Letter, and the May 12 Letters.  \n53 See Jon Michael Raasch, Trump Escalates War on Harvard by Officially Terminating $2.2B in \nFederal Grants, Daily Mail (May 7, 2025), https://perma.cc/9QKQ-2H5W.  \n \n  28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 30 of 60\nand targeting of Jewish students.” Ex.

NIH claimed \nthat “no modification of the projects could align the projects with agency priorities” because of \n“the University’s unwillingness to take corrective action or implement necessary reforms.” Id. \n89.   On May 9, 2025, USDA sent Harvard a similar letter announcing the termination \nof awards and stating that Harvard’s grant “awards no longer effectuate agency priorities” because \nof “recent events at Harvard University involving antisemitic action” and “Harvard’s ongoing \ninaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students.” Ex. F at \n2. The letter asserted that “no modification of the projects could align the projects with agency \npriorities” because of “the University’s unwillingness to take corrective action or implement \nnecessary reforms.” Id. \n90.  On May 12, 2025, Harvard received letters from the Department of Energy, DoD, \nNSF, and HUD announcing the respective agencies’ terminations of Harvard’s awards. Ex. G; Ex. \nH; Ex. I; Ex. J. \n91.  The May 12 Energy Termination Letter invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and \nstated that Harvard’s grant “awards no longer effectuate[]” agency priorities because of “recent \nevents at Harvard involving antisemitic action” and “Harvard’s ongoing inaction in the face of \nrepeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students.” Ex. G at 2. The letter asserted \nthat “no modification of the Harvard projects could align the projects with agency priorities and \nany  continued  funding  of  the  projects  is  inconsistent  with  [the  Department  of  Energy’s] \nstewardship of American taxpayer funds and would be inconsistent with [the Department of \nEnergy’s] overall mission and goals” because “Harvard has refused to take immediate, definitive, \n  29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 31 of 60\nand appropriate remedial action.” Id. The letter also cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.343 and stated that “costs \nto the recipient or subrecipient resulting from financial obligations incurred by the recipient or \nsubrecipient during the termination of this award are not allowable.” Id. at 3. \n92.  The May 12 DoD Termination Letter invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and stated \nits “awards to Harvard University no longer effectuate agency priorities of the DoD” because of \n“recent  events  at  Harvard  University  involving  antisemitic  action”  and  “Harvard’s  ongoing \ninaction in the face of repeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students.” Ex. H at \n2. That letter also cited 2 C.F.R. § 200.344 and stated that “[c]osts resulting from financial \nobligations incurred after termination are not allowable.” Id.  \n93.  The May 12 NSF Termination Letter stated that “[t]he agency has determined that \nthe termination of certain awards is necessary because they are not in alignment with current NSF \npriorities and/or programmatic goals.” Ex. I at 2. As the basis for its termination, NSF asserted that \n“Harvard continues to engage in race discrimination including in its admissions process, and in \nother areas of student life, as well as failing to promote a research environment free of antisemitism \nand bias.” Id. NSF’s letter states “[t]his is the final agency decision and not subject to appeal.” Id. \n94.  The May 12 HUD Termination Letter invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) and stated \nthat Harvard’s “awards no longer effectuate agency priorities.” Ex. J at 2. The letter contained no \nexplanation as to which agency priorities had changed or why Harvard’s grant awards were no \nlonger in alignment with agency priorities.    \n95.  On May 13, 2025, the Federal Task Force issued a press release claiming “Harvard \nUniversity has repeatedly failed to confront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic \nharassment plaguing its campus,” and stating that “[t]he Task Force fully supports the Trump \n  30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 32 of 60\nAdministration’s  multi-agency  move  to  cut  funding  to  Harvard,  demonstrating  the  entire \nAdministration’s commitment to eradicating discrimination on Harvard’s campus.”54 \n96.  The Government’s repeated assertion that Harvard has refused to take remedial \naction ignores the “meaningful reforms” Harvard is undertaking to “eliminate antisemitism and \nother forms of hate from [its] campus,” which have been detailed publicly.55 \n97.  The Office of Management and Budget’s (“OMB”) Uniform Guidance (which \napplies  to  all  federal  Government  agencies  that  award  research  grants)  and  specific  HHS \nregulations (which apply directly to NIH, among other HHS subagencies) require the awarding \nagency to reimburse award recipients within 30 calendar days of a request for reimbursement, \nunless  the  awarding  agency  “reasonably  believes  the  request  to  be  improper.”  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3);  45  C.F.R.  § 75.305(b)(3).  Allowable  payments  may  be  delayed  under  the \nUniform Guidance only where the recipient (i) “has failed to comply with the terms and conditions \nof  the  Federal  award,”  or  (ii) “is  delinquent  in  a  debt  to  the  United  States.”  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(6). Similarly, under HHS regulations, the withholding of allowable payments is \npermitted only under specific circumstances, including where the recipient “has failed to comply \nwith the project objectives, Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward”; the recipient “is delinquent in a debt to the United States”; or under other specified \ncircumstances. 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(6). If a recipient fails to comply with federal statutes, \nregulations, or the terms and conditions of a federal award, HHS may impose additional conditions, \nwhich (i) must be imposed with respect to a “specific award,” (ii) do not include the delay of \n \n54   Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., Joint Task Force to Combat Anti-\nSemitism Statement on Additional Harvard Actions (May 13, 2025), https://perma.cc/99B4-AG8Z. \n55  Letter from Alan M.

Only if and when the HHS \nentity “determines that noncompliance cannot be remedied by imposing additional conditions” \nmay HHS withhold payments. 45 C.F.R. § 75.371. Importantly, any “payment withheld for failure \nto comply with Federal award conditions, but without suspension of the Federal award, must be \nreleased to the [recipient] upon subsequent compliance.” 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(6)(iii). \n98.  Unless and until the April 14 and May 5 Freeze Orders are dissolved, and the \nGovernment’s subsequent implementation of those Orders in the Termination Letters enjoined or \nvacated, Harvard will suffer widespread disruption of its research operations, with Harvard—and \nthose faculty, staff, and students  whose salaries are supported by the  frozen or terminated \nfunding—not knowing when, or if, existing funding will resume or whether it will be available in \nthe future. This disruption threatens the integrity and continuity of ongoing research studies \nsupported by the frozen or terminated funding, as well as their future viability. At this point, for \nexample, Harvard does not know whether to end employment of anyone whose salary was \nsupported by the frozen or terminated funding or what its future hiring decisions should look like. \nNor does it know whether to expend funds to retain such items as cell cultures and other living and \nperishable  materials  used  in  research  or  to  continue  maintenance  of  research  supplies  and \nequipment tied to the frozen or terminated funding. \nConsequences of the Government’s Actions \n99.  The effect of Defendants’ actions is to eliminate billions of dollars for Harvard’s \nfederally funded research. Over time, the school will be forced to either (i) reduce or halt ongoing \nresearch projects mid-stream and terminate employment contracts with researchers, staff, and \nadministrators, or (ii) to make other cuts to departments or programs.  \n  32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 34 of 60\n100.  If Harvard continues to replace the frozen and terminated funding from its own \nresources, it will be forced to reduce the number of graduate students it admits and the number of \nfaculty and research staff it pays to conduct research. It will be unable to continue procuring and \nmaintaining cutting-edge supplies, equipment, and facilities for research. Without the federal \nfunding at issue, Harvard would need to operate at a significantly reduced level. And Harvard’s \noverall reputation as a premier research institution will suffer, compromising its ability to recruit \nand retain talent, secure future funding, and maintain its relationships with other institutions. \n101.  Harvard  is  one  of  Massachusetts’  largest  employers.  Consequently,  the \nGovernment’s actions will also cause economic harm to the Boston area and the Commonwealth. \nAnd the impact will be felt in other states as well. As a recipient of federal research funding, \nHarvard issues subawards to institutions across America, including St. Jude Children’s Research \nHospital, the University of Alabama, and Baylor College of Medicine.  \n102.  Harvard frequently collaborates with state and local partners on regional initiatives \nto fuel spending in the local economy. The freezes and terminations will reduce, delay, or eliminate \nmuch of this activity.  \n103.  The freezes and terminations will chill Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment \nrights. Harvard will be unable to make decisions regarding its faculty hiring, academic programs, \nstudent admissions, and other core academic matters without fear that those decisions will run \nafoul of government censors’ views on acceptable levels of ideological or viewpoint diversity on \ncampus. \n104.  Notably, the freezes and terminations are part of a broader effort by the Government \nto punish Harvard for protecting its constitutional rights. In the month since Harvard’s April 14 \nletter and statement, the Government has launched multiple investigations and other actions \n  33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 35 of 60\nagainst Harvard. On April 16, 2025, for example, DHS threatened Harvard’s eligibility to enroll \ninternational students.56 On April 17, 2025, the House Committee on Oversight and Government \nReform announced an investigation into Harvard.57 Also on April 17, 2025, the Department of \nEducation sent a records request to Harvard.58 On April 24, 2025, President Trump derided \nHarvard as “an Anti-Semitic, Far Left Institution” and “a threat to  Democracy.”59 And the \nPresident has announced, “We are going to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what \nthey deserve!”60 \n105.  The freezes and terminations also will adversely affect the broader landscape of \nAmerican scientific and medical  research and economic innovation by undermining critical \nresearch initiatives and interrupting ongoing scientific and other research. By halting the flow of \nfederal funding, present and future, the freezes and terminations create a ripple effect extending \nbeyond Harvard’s campus by stifling job creation in the research sector across the nation, reducing \nintellectual property development, and delaying scientific and medical advances that boost the \nnational economy and improve patient care. The economic implications are substantial, as each \nsuspended research project hinders the cultivation of the scientific talent that drives the United \nStates’ global competitiveness in research and development. As President Garber put it, “[f]or the \n \n56   Samuel A. Church & Cam N.

Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n107.  Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), a court shall “hold unlawful and \nset aside agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \nimmunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n108.  The Government threatened to terminate Harvard’s federal funding unless Harvard \nrestructured  its  internal  governance,  changed  its  hiring  and  admissions  practices  to  strike \nDefendants’ preferred balance of viewpoints, and modified what it teaches its students to align \nwith Defendants’ views. For example, the demands required Harvard to modify its hiring and \nadmissions practices to achieve a particular balance of viewpoints in every “department,” “field,” \nand “teaching unit.” Ex. A at 3. In other words, the Government wielded the threat of withholding \nfederal funds in an attempt to coerce Harvard to conform with the Government’s preferred mix of \nviewpoints and ideologies. Defendants sent Harvard the April 11 Letter and, when Harvard refused \nthe demands, ordered the freeze of billions of dollars in current federal funding. After Harvard \nfiled this lawsuit, Defendants announced the end of future federal funding and termination of \nHarvard’s grants.   \n \n61   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2. \n  35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 37 of 60\n109.  Defendants’ freeze and termination of Harvard’s federal funding constitutes final \nagency action because it “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the . . . decisionmaking process” and \n“determines” the “rights [and] obligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177-78 (1997) (citations omitted). \n110.  The  First  Amendment  provides  that  the  federal  Government  “shall  make  no \nlaw . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n111.  “[A]cademic freedom” is “a special concern of the First Amendment” and receives \nheightened protection. Keyishian v. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603 (1967). \n112.  This freedom protects “not only students and teachers, but their host institutions as \nwell.” Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d at 8 (citation omitted). As the Supreme Court has recognized, \n“[a]cademic freedom thrives not only on the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among \nteachers and students, but also . . . on autonomous decisionmaking by the academy itself.” Regents \nof Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 226 n.12 (1985) (citations omitted). Colleges and \nuniversities have a constitutionally protected right to “manage an academic community and \nevaluate teaching and scholarship free from [governmental] interference.” Blasdel v. Nw. Univ., \n687 F.3d 813, 816 (7th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted). After all, “[i]f there is any fixed star in our \nconstitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox \nin politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word \nor act their faith therein.” W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943). \n113.  A “funding condition” that seeks to curtail academic freedom can therefore “result \nin an unconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights.” Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. for Open \nSoc’y Int’l, Inc. (“AID”), 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013). The Government “may not deny a benefit to \na person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests.” Perry v. Sindermann, \n  36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 38 of 60\n408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972). Nor may the Government threaten “a third party ‘to achieve the \nsuppression’ of disfavored speech.” Vullo, 602 U.S. at 180-81, 188-91. The Government also \ncannot mandate its own preferred balance of viewpoints. Miami Herald Pub. Co. v. Tornillo, 418 \nU.S. 241, 256-58 (1974). “On the spectrum of dangers to free expression, there are few greater \nthan allowing the government to change the speech of private actors in order to achieve its own \nconception of speech nirvana.” Moody, 603 U.S. at 741-42. \n114.  The  Government’s  demands  on  Harvard  cut  at  the  core  of  Harvard’s \nconstitutionally protected academic freedom because they seek to assert governmental control over \nHarvard’s research, academic programs, community, and governance.62 And they bear no relation \nto Harvard’s federal funding. See AID, 570 U.S. at 214-15 (Government may not “leverage funding \nto regulate speech outside the contours of the program itself”). The Government’s demands seek \nto overhaul Harvard’s governance, control Harvard’s faculty hiring, and dictate what faculty may \nteach Harvard students. Put simply, the conditions seek to supplant Harvard’s “autonomous \ndecisionmaking.” Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226 n.12. \n115.  Restrictions on Harvard’s programs violate the First Amendment by seeking to \nrestrict what Harvard’s faculty may teach students. See Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d at 8 (recognizing \na “zone of First Amendment protection for the educational process itself” (citation omitted)). The \n“classroom with its surrounding environs is peculiarly the ‘marketplace of ideas’” that the First \nAmendment is designed to safeguard. Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-81 (1972). \n116.  Restrictions on whom Harvard may hire also violate the First Amendment. It is \nHarvard’s—not the Government’s—“prerogative ‘to determine for itself on academic grounds \n \n62   See,  e.g.,  Eugene  Volokh,  “The  Trump  Administration’s  Unconstitutional  Hate  Mail  to \nHarvard,” by Prof. Genevieve Lakier (Chicago), Reason (Apr. 6, 2025), https://perma.cc/K3W6-\nLB94. \n  37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 39 of 60\nwho may teach,’” and this discretion “is an important part of our long tradition of academic \nfreedom.” Weinstock v. Columbia Univ., 224 F.3d 33, 47 (2d Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).  \n117.  Further,  the  Government’s  requirement  that  Harvard  modify  its  hiring  and \nadmissions practices to achieve the Government’s preferred balance of viewpoints in every \n“department,” “field,” and “teaching unit” (Ex. A at 3-4;63 see Ex. D at 2-3) regulates the \n“recipient” and is far “‘outside the scope of the federally funded program[s]’” for medical, \nscientific,  and  other  research,  AID,  570  U.S.  at  218  (citation  omitted).  Although  Harvard \nrecognizes  the  importance  of  viewpoint  diversity  and  the  need  to  promote  it,64  the  First \nAmendment makes clear that the authority to achieve that objective rests with the University rather \nthan the Government. \n118.  Likewise, the Government lacks authority to dictate which student groups Harvard \nmay recognize and fund. The Government “may not interfere with private actors’ speech to \nadvance its own vision of ideological balance.” Moody, 603 U.S. at 741. \n119.  Restrictions on Harvard’s ability to manage its own internal leadership likewise \nviolate the First Amendment because leadership decisions shape how the University speaks and \nacts. Those decisions are at the core of the “autonomous decisionmaking” and independent \nmanagement needed to maintain “[a]cademic freedom.” Ewing, 474 U.S. at 226 n.12; see Blasdel, \n687 F.3d at 816 (universities have First Amendment right to “manage an academic community” \n(citation omitted)).  \n \n63   See  @realDonaldTrump,  Truth  Social  (Apr.  16,  2025,  6:05  AM), \nhttps://tinyurl.com/yww6nfw7 (“Harvard has been hiring almost all woke, Radical Left, idiots and \n‘birdbrains’  who  are  only  capable  of  teaching  FAILURE  to  students  and  so-called  ‘future \nleaders.’”) \n64   Garber, The Promise of American Higher Education, supra n.2 (“As we defend Harvard, we \nwill continue to . . . broaden the intellectual and viewpoint diversity within our community.”). \n  38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 40 of 60\n120.  Defendants’ April 3, April 11, and May 5 Letters target academic content that \nHarvard professors “teach students.” Ex. P at 3; see Ex. A at 3-5; Ex. D at 2-3. That too is unlawful. \nE.g., Santa Cruz Lesbian & Gay Cmty. Ctr. v. Trump, 508 F. Supp. 3d 521, 542-43 (N.D. Cal. \n2020) (preliminarily enjoining executive order that “appear[ed] to require universities that accept \nfederal grants to curtail promotion of [certain] concepts through teaching”). \n121.  Defendants’  freeze  and  termination  of  federal  funding  also  violates  the  First \nAmendment because it is direct retaliation for Harvard’s April 14 letter and statement refusing to \ncomply with the Government’s demands, as well as Harvard’s protected decision to file this \nlawsuit. The First Amendment “prohibits government officials from subjecting an [entity] to \nretaliatory actions for engaging in protected speech.” Nieves v. Bartlett, 587 U.S. 391, 398 (2019) \n(cleaned up). To succeed on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a plaintiff must “prove that \n(1) [it] engaged in constitutionally protected conduct, (2) [it] was subjected to an adverse action \nby the defendant, and (3) the protected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the \nadverse action.” D.B. ex rel. Elizabeth B. v. Esposito, 675 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 2012); see Hartman \nv. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 260-61 (2006) (similar). \n122.  Harvard engaged in constitutionally protected conduct when it refused to comply \nwith the Government’s demands and announced that decision in its April 14 letter and statement. \nJust hours later, Defendants subjected Harvard to adverse action by freezing $2.2 billion in multi-\nyear grants and $60 million in multi-year contracts previously awarded to Harvard. And then the \nGovernment  blacklisted  Harvard  from  future  awards  of  federal  funding  and  subsequently \nterminated existing grants. Harvard’s protected conduct was a substantial and motivating factor \nfor the freeze. In particular, Defendants issued the Freeze Orders because Harvard refused to \ncomply with the demands, because Harvard issued the April 14 letter and statement, and because \n  39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 41 of 60\nHarvard filed this lawsuit. The causal link between Defendants’ retaliatory motive and Defendants’ \nadverse action is evident from, among other things: the minuscule amount of time that elapsed \nbetween Harvard’s April 11 letter and statement and the freeze (only a few hours); Defendants’ \nstriking deviation from the procedures that govern funding suspensions under Title VI (see infra \nCount 3); Defendants’ previous threats to pull funding if Harvard refused to comply with the \ndemands (including on March 31, April 3, and April 11); the decision by the Secretary of Education \nto prohibit Harvard from receiving any future federal grants; and the termination of that funding \nwithout following any of the requisite procedures. \n123.  Defendants’  Freeze  Orders,  Termination  Letters,  and  attendant  conditions  on \nHarvard’s federal funding trigger strict scrutiny because they seek to leverage Harvard’s federal \nfunding to indirectly infringe Harvard’s constitutionally protected academic freedom.  \n124.  Defendants’ Freeze Orders, Termination Letters, and attendant conditions also \ntrigger strict scrutiny because they are speaker-, content-, and viewpoint-based. The conditions \nexpressly apply to Harvard only; they apply because of the “ideological” conditions at Harvard, \nEx. A at 2; Ex. D at 2-3; and they specify exactly how Harvard should exercise its constitutionally \nprotected autonomous decisionmaking. Unless Harvard does exactly what the Government wants \nin the way the Government wants and achieves the precise balance of viewpoints the Government \nwants, Harvard stands to lose billions of dollars in federal funding. \n125.  Where, as here, “the Government restricts speech, the Government bears the burden \nof proving the constitutionality of its actions.” FEC v. Cruz, 596 U.S. 289, 305 (2022) (citation \nomitted).  \n  40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 42 of 60\n126.  Defendants cannot reasonably argue that the conditions they seek to impose on \nHarvard are “the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling [governmental] interest.” Ams. \nfor Prosperity Found. v. Bonta, 594 U.S. 595, 607 (2021) (citation omitted). \n127.  The conditions are overbroad because they seek to impose a massive consequence \nunless an enormous amount of constitutionally protected academic freedom is curtailed. And that \ncurtailment is not sufficiently related to the Government’s previously-identified concerns about \nantisemitism. \n128.  The conditions are also overbroad because Defendants have ignored less restrictive \nalternatives. For example, the Government has not explained why it could not have worked with \nHarvard in a voluntary manner, as Title VI and regulations require, prior to freezing or terminating \nfunding entirely.  And even if a  freeze or termination were warranted, which it is  not, the \nGovernment has not explained why a more targeted reduction, tailored to the programs and \npurported discrimination at issue, would have been insufficient to achieve its objectives. \n129.  The conditions are further overbroad because they will chill a wide swath of \nprotected speech. The “government [cannot] proscribe unprotected [speech] through a regulation \nthat simultaneously encompasses a substantial amount of protected [speech].” Seals v. McBee, 898 \nF.3d 587, 596 (5th Cir. 2018). \n130.  Harvard  also  has  a  reasonable  fear  that  Defendants  will  terminate  or  freeze \nadditional federal funding, as they have threatened to do. See Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, \n573 U.S. 149, 165-66 (2014).  \n131.  For these reasons, this Court should declare Defendants’ actions unlawful and \nenjoin Defendants from engaging in future terminations, suspensions, or refusals to grant or to \ncontinue funding or work pursuant to the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters. \n  41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 43 of 60\n132.  Defendants’ actions must be vacated and “set aside” under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n133.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \nCOUNT 2 \nVIOLATION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT \n(EQUITABLE CAUSE OF ACTION — ULTRA VIRES) \n134.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n135.  Even if the prerequisites of review under the Administrative Procedure Act were \nnot satisfied, federal courts have the “equitable power[]” to “enjoin unconstitutional actions by \nstate and federal officers.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327-28 (2015); \nsee also R.I. Dep’t of Env’t. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d 31, 42-43 (1st Cir. 2002) (“district \ncourt[s]” retain the “nonstatutory” power “to review agency action that is ultra vires” and provide \nequitable relief unless Congress precludes that review). \n136.  As alleged in Count 1, Defendants’ demands that Harvard restructure its internal \ngovernance, change its hiring and admissions practices, and modify what it teaches its students to \nalign with Defendants’ views, or else lose federal funding, violate the First Amendment. The \nConstitution forecloses any lawful authority for Defendants’ actions.  \n137.  Because Defendants’ actions in imposing viewpoint-based conditions on Harvard’s \nfunding and terminating funding agreements violate the First Amendment, those actions lack \nlawful authority. This Court should declare them unconstitutional and ultra vires.  \n138.  Because Defendants’ actions are unconstitutional and ultra vires, this Court should \nenjoin Defendants in their official capacities from imposing the Freeze Orders and Termination \nLetters.  \n139.  If  Defendants’  actions  are  not  declared  unlawful,  set  aside,  and  enjoined  as \n  42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 44 of 60\nunconstitutional and ultra vires, Harvard will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT 3 \nIN EXCESS OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY (VIOLATION OF 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1) \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n140.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n141.  The APA provides that a court must “hold unlawful and set aside” final agency \naction that is “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory \nright.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n142.  Defendants’  freeze  and  termination  of  federal  financial  assistance  constitutes \n“[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n143.  Defendants’ freeze and termination of federal financial assistance constitutes final \nagency action because it “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the . . . decisionmaking process” and \n“determines” the “rights [and] obligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (citations omitted).  \n144.  Defendants imposed the freeze and termination of federal financial assistance \nbecause of alleged antisemitism on Harvard’s campus. Antisemitism at Harvard was the reason \ngiven by the federal Government in the March 31, April 3, and April 11 Letters, and in the April \n14 Freeze Order. See Ex. M at 2, Ex. P at 2, Ex. A at 2, 4. The May 5 Freeze Order and Termination \nLetters echoed these same concerns. See, e.g., Ex. D at 2-3; Ex. E at 2-3; Ex. F at 2; Ex. G at 2; \nEx. H at 2, Ex. I at 2. \n145.  This basis for freezing or terminating federal financial assistance falls within Title \nVI. Title VI prohibits discrimination on the basis of “race, color, or national origin” in programs \nand activities receiving federal financial assistance. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Both the judicial and \nexecutive branches have interpreted discrimination against Jews as discrimination based on race \n  43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 45 of 60\nor shared ancestry covered under Title VI. See, e.g., Bachman v. St. Monica’s Congregation, 902 \nF.2d 1259, 1261 (7th Cir. 1990); Exec. Order No. 13,899, 84 Fed. Reg. 68,779 (Dec. 11, 2019) \n(“It shall be the policy of the executive branch to enforce Title VI against prohibited forms of \ndiscrimination rooted in anti-Semitism.”).  \n146.  Title  VI  delineates  specific  procedures  that  an  agency  must  follow  to \n“terminat[e] . . . or refus[e] to grant or to continue assistance” based upon alleged violations of \nTitle VI. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1. Defendants have ordered the freeze or termination of Harvard’s \nfederal financial assistance without following these mandatory procedures.  \n147.  Defendants did not advise Harvard of any failure to comply with a requirement \nimposed by Section 2000d-1. \n148.  Defendants did not provide Harvard with any opportunity to comply by voluntary \nmeans before freezing and terminating federal financial assistance.  \n149.  Defendants did not afford Harvard an opportunity for a hearing before freezing and \nterminating federal financial assistance. \n150.  Defendants did not make an express finding on the record after any such hearing \nbefore freezing and terminating federal financial assistance. \n151.  Defendants did not submit a written report to the appropriate House and Senate \ncommittees thirty days before freezing and terminating federal financial assistance.  \n152.  Rather, Defendants are purporting to immediately freeze current and future funds. \nThat  is,  whereas  Congress  specified  that  Defendants  must  follow  the  delineated  statutory \nprocedures first and freeze or terminate federal financial assistance after (and then only as a last \nresort), here Defendants have done the precise opposite: they issued the Freeze Orders (with no \nprocess  or  opportunity  for  voluntary  compliance)  and  used  those  freezes  and  subsequent \n  44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 46 of 60\nterminations as leverage to negotiate. Such action is flatly unlawful and contrary to statutory \nauthority.  \n153.  What is more, Title VI does not permit wholesale freezing of a recipient’s federal \nfinancial assistance. Instead, it requires that a “refusal to grant or to continue assistance” be \n“limited in its effect to the particular program, or part thereof, in which . . . noncompliance has \nbeen so found.” Id. (emphasis added). Defendants have made no finding of Title VI noncompliance \nwithin the various research programs that are subject to the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters. \n154.  Further, Defendants’ actions offer no explanation of how any alleged violation is \nconnected to the remedy chosen by the government. That explanation is necessary to determine \nwhether the freezes and terminations affected only particular programs or parts of programs where \nalleged violations purportedly exist.  \n155.  Defendants’  April  3  Letter  also  mentioned  unspecified  “alleged  violations \nof . . . Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.” Ex. P at 2. But Title VII does not authorize \nadministrative enforcement through a funding freeze. And Defendants do not have the requisite \nauthority to enforce Title VII here. Instead, Title VII establishes a judicial enforcement scheme \ncentered on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the courts. See 42 U.S.C. \n§ 2000e-5(f)-(g). \n156.  For these reasons, this Court should declare that Defendants’ actions are “in excess \nof statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C); set those actions aside; \nand enjoin Defendants and their agents, employees, and all persons acting under their direction or \ncontrol from taking any action as to Harvard, including by terminating, freezing, or refusing to \ngrant or to continue Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n  45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 47 of 60\n157.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective date of the freeze. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 705. \n158.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT 4 \nFAILURE TO FOLLOW DEFENDANTS’ OWN REGULATORY PROCEDURES \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n \n159.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs.  \n160.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action that \nis “not in accordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), or that is “without observance of procedure \nrequired by law,” id. § 706(2)(D). \n161.  Defendants’  freeze  and  termination  of  federal  financial  assistance  constitutes \n“[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n162.  Defendants’ freeze and termination of federal financial assistance constitutes final \nagency action because it “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the . . . decisionmaking process” and \n“determines” the “rights [and] obligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (citations omitted).  \n163.  An agency “must abide by its own regulations.” Fort Stewart Schs. v. Fed. Labor \nRels. Auth., 495 U.S. 641, 654 (1990) (citing Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. 535, 547 (1959)). \n164.  Defendants’ regulations require them to follow specific procedures for freezing or \nterminating federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. \n§ 80.2 (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.1 (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.1 (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.1 \n(Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.2 (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.203 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.103 \n(DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.101 (NASA); 24 C.F.R § 1.8 (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8 (USDA). \n  46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 48 of 60\n165.  Defendants  failed  to  comply  with  their  own  regulations  before  freezing  and \nterminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n166.  Defendants’  regulations  require  them  to  provide  notice  before  freezing  or \nterminating federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. \n§ 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(1) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 10 C.F.R. \n§ 1040.89-9(c)(1) (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 \nC.F.R. § 42.108(c)(1) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(1) (HUD); 7 \nC.F.R. § 15.8(c)(1)  (USDA). \n167.  Defendants did not provide the required notice to Harvard before freezing and \nterminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n168.  Defendants’  regulations  require  them  to  attempt  to  secure  compliance  “by \nvoluntary means” before freezing or terminating federal financial assistance based on alleged \nviolations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(1) (NSF); \n32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); \n28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c)(1) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(1) (HUD); \n7 C.F.R. § 15.8(c)(1) (USDA); see 10 C.F.R. § 1040.89-9(c)(1) (Energy) (similar). \n169.  Defendants did not lawfully attempt to secure compliance by voluntary means \nbefore freezing and terminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n170.  Defendants’ regulations require them to provide an “opportunity for hearing” \nbefore freezing or terminating federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. \nE.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(2) (NSF); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) \n(Education);  41  C.F.R.  § 101-6.211-3  (GSA);  28  C.F.R.  § 42.108(c)(2)  (DOJ);  14  C.F.R. \n§ 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(2) (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(c)(2) (USDA); see 32 C.F.R. \n  47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 49 of 60\n§ 195.9(c) (DoD) (“opportunity for a hearing”); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.89-9(a)(1) (Energy) (same). \nDefendants’ regulations require them to hold hearings before a specific agency official or a \n“hearing  examiner”  in  accordance  with  specific,  formal  procedures  that  Defendants  have \npromulgated. 45 C.F.R. § 80.9(b) (HHS  and  NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.9(b)  (NSF); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 100.9(b) (Education); 32 C.F.R. § 195.10(b) (DoD); 28 C.F.R. § 42.109(b) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. \n§ 1250.108(b) (NASA); 7 C.F.R. § 15.9(d) (USDA); see 10 C.F.R. §§ 1040.121 to 1040.124 \n(listing  Energy’s  procedures);  41  C.F.R.  §§ 101-6.212-1  to  101-6.212-5  (listing  GSA’s \nprocedures); 24 C.F.R. § 180.100-805 (listing HUD’s  procedures).   \n171.  Defendants did not provide Harvard an opportunity for a hearing before freezing \nand terminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance, nor did they comply with any of the formal \nprocedural requirements for such a hearing set out in their regulations. \n172.  Defendants’ regulations require them to make “an express finding on the record” \nbefore freezing or terminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance based on alleged violations \nof Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(2) (NSF); 10 C.F.R. \n§ 1040.114(c) (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 \nC.F.R. § 42.108(c)(2) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(2) (HUD); 7 \nC.F.R. § 15.8(c)(2) (USDA); see 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD) (similar). \n173.  Defendants did not make express findings on the record before  freezing and \nterminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance. \n174.  Defendants’ regulations require them to “file[] with the committee of the House \nand the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program involved, a full \nwritten report of the circumstances and the grounds for such action” before freezing or terminating \nHarvard’s federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. E.g., 45 C.F.R. \n  48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 50 of 60\n§ 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 32 \nC.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c)(4) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 \nC.F.R. § 1.8(c)(4) (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(c)(4) (USDA); see 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c)(4) (NSF) \n(similar); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.114(e) (Energy) (similar). \n175.  Defendants did not file full written reports in the House and Senate before freezing \nand terminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI. \n176.  Defendants’  regulations  prohibit  them  from  freezing  or  terminating  federal \nfinancial assistance based on alleged violations of Title VI at any time before “the expiration of 30 \ndays after” filing reports in the House and Senate. E.g., 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 32 \nC.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.114(e) (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(c) (Education); 41 \nC.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c)(4) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(c) (NASA); \n24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(4) (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(c)(4) (USDA); see 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c) (NSF) \n(similar). \n177.  Defendants froze and terminated Harvard’s federal financial assistance before the \nexpiration of 30 days after filing reports in the House and Senate.  \n178.  Defendants’ regulations require that any freeze or termination of federal financial \nassistance based on alleged violations of Title VI “shall be limited in its effect to the particular \nprogram, or part thereof, in which such noncompliance has been so found.” E.g., 45 C.F.R. \n§ 80.8(c) (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(c) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(c) (DoD); 34 C.F.R. \n§ 100.8(c) (Education); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-3 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(c) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. \n§ 1250.107(c) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(c)(4) (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(c)(4) (USDA); see 10 \nC.F.R. § 1040.114(e) (Energy) (similar). \n  49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 51 of 60\n179.  Defendants froze and terminated Harvard’s federal financial assistance without \nlimiting the effect of this action to any particular program or part thereof. \n180.  Defendants’ regulations require them to follow specific procedures if they seek to \n“effect compliance” with Title VI using “any other means authorized by law.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) \n(HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8(d) (NSF); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(d) \n(Education); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(d) \n(HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(d) (USDA); see 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(d) (DoD) (similar); 41 C.F.R. § 101-\n6.211-4 (GSA) (similar). \n181.  Defendants did not attempt to effect compliance with Title VI using any means \nother than immediately freezing and terminating Harvard’s federal financial assistance.  \n182.  Instead, Defendants sought to “effect compliance” with Title VI only by “means” \nof freezes (and corresponding termination of federal financial assistance). Because they did so, \ntheir own regulations require them to follow all of the procedures just discussed—including \nvoluntary compliance, notice, hearing, findings on the record, and a report to Congress. E.g., 45 \nC.F.R. § 80.8 (HHS and NIH); 45 C.F.R. § 611.8 (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9 (DoD); 10 C.F.R. \n§§ 1040.89-9, 1040.114 to.115 (Energy); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8 (Education); 41 C.F.R. §§ 101-6.211-\n3 to -4 (GSA); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108 (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107 (NASA); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8 (HUD); \n7 C.F.R. § 15.8 (USDA). \n183.  Even if Defendants had attempted to “effect compliance” with Title VI using “other \nmeans authorized by law,” Defendants failed to comply with the specific procedures that their own \nregulations require in connection with those “other means.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) (HHS and NIH); \n45 C.F.R. § 611.8(d) (NSF); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(d) (DoD); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy); 34 \nC.F.R. § 100.8(d) (Education); 28 C.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA); \n  50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 52 of 60\n24 C.F.R. § 1.8(d) (HUD); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(d) (USDA); see 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-4 (GSA) \n(similar). \n184.  Specifically, Defendants failed to attempt to secure compliance by “voluntary \nmeans,” failed to notify Harvard “of its failure to comply and of the action to be taken,” took action \nbefore “the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice,” and failed to make \n“additional efforts . . . to persuade [Harvard] to comply with the regulation and to take such \ncorrective action as may be appropriate.” 45 C.F.R. § 80.8(d) (HHS and NIH); see 45 C.F.R. \n§ 611.8(d) (NSF) (similar); 32 C.F.R. § 195.9(d) (DoD) (similar); 10 C.F.R. § 1040.115 (Energy) \n(similar); 34 C.F.R. § 100.8(d) (Education) (similar); 41 C.F.R. § 101-6.211-4 (GSA) (similar); 28 \nC.F.R. § 42.108(d) (DOJ) (similar); 14 C.F.R. § 1250.107(d) (NASA) (similar); 24 C.F.R. § 1.8(d) \n(HUD) (similar); 7 C.F.R. § 15.8(d) (USDA) (similar).  \n185.  The March 31, April 3, April 11, May 5, May 6, May 9, and May 12 Letters do not \nconstitute efforts at voluntary compliance. Not one of the letters identified a Title VI violation or \na specific measure Harvard could take to rectify the alleged violation.  \n186.  Defendants’  actions  also  further  violate  the  Uniform  Guidance,  2  C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3), (6), as implemented by the relevant agencies. For example, HHS regulations \nimplementing the Uniform Guidance require payment under active grants within 30 days. 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(3); 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(3). Delay is permissible only under certain circumstances \ndelineated in the applicable regulations and only after notice and an opportunity to cure. 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.305(b)(6); 45 C.F.R. § 75.207; 45 C.F.R. § 75.305(b)(6). Defendants have provided no \nnotice and no opportunity to cure. \n187.  The May 6 NIH Termination Letter, May 12 Energy Termination Letter, May 12 \nDoD Termination Letter, and May 12 HUD Termination Letter invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) \n  51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 53 of 60\nand stated that Harvard’s “awards no longer effectuate agency priorities.” Ex. E at 2; Ex. G at 2; \nEx. H at 2; Ex. J at 2. The May 9 USDA Letter and May 12 NSF letter similarly purported to \ncancel Harvard’s grant awards because they “no longer effectuate agency priorities,” Ex. F at 2, \nand because “they are not in alignment with current NSF priorities and/or programmatic goals.” \nEx. I at 2. But the letters purported to terminate some grants to which that provision does not apply. \nDefendants have not articulated any change in agency priorities justifying wholesale termination \nof Harvard’s award across every subject matter and area of research.  \n188.  That provision does not authorize an end-run around Title VI, or related regulations \nfor enforcing Title VI’s requirements, which provide a far more specific set of procedures. In their \ntermination  letters,  Defendants  cited  “antisemitic  action”  on  campus  and  “the  University’s \nunwillingness  to  take  corrective  action  or  implement  necessary  reforms”  as  the  basis  for \nterminating federal financial assistance. Ex. E at 3; Ex. F at 2; see Ex. G at 2 (similar); Ex. H at 2 \n(similar); Ex. I at 2 (similar). But Defendants did not identify Title VI violations or follow the \nrelevant statutory and regulatory procedures for Title VI enforcement.  \n189.  Instead,  Defendants’  invocations  of  2  C.F.R.  §  200.340(a)(4)  are  post-hoc \nrationalizations for Defendants’ earlier failure to follow Title VI procedures and regulations before \nfreezing Harvard’s federal financial assistance.    \n190.  Defendants’ actions must be declared unlawful, vacated and “set aside” under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D), and enjoined. \n191.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective date of the freezes and \nterminations. See 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n192.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \n  52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 54 of 60\nCOUNT 5 \nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS AGENCY ACTION \n(ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT CAUSE OF ACTION) \n193.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n194.  The APA requires this Court to hold unlawful and set aside any final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n195.  Defendants’  freeze  and  termination  of  federal  financial  assistance  constitutes \n“[a]gency action made reviewable by statute” under 5 U.S.C. § 704 and 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2. \n196.  Defendants’ freeze and termination of federal financial assistance constitutes final \nagency action because it “mark[s] the ‘consummation’ of the . . . decisionmaking process” and \n“determines” the “rights [and] obligations” of parties and is backed by “legal consequences.” \nBennett, 520 U.S. at 177-78 (citations omitted).  \n197.  Defendants’  actions  are  arbitrary  and  capricious  because  they  are  neither \n“reasonable  [nor]  reasonably  explained.”  Ohio  v.  EPA,  603  U.S.  279,  292  (2024)  (citation \nomitted). They are not the product of “reasoned decisionmaking.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of \nU.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 52 (1983).  \n198.  Defendants’  actions  “entirely  fail[]  to  consider . . . important  aspect[s]  of  the \nproblem.” Id. at 43; see also DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Calif., 591 U.S. 1, 30 (2020). They \nignore the significant consequences the freezes and terminations will have on researchers, the \nUniversity, and the public.  \n199.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious because Defendants failed to \n“articulate  a  satisfactory  explanation  for  [their]  action[s]”  and  demonstrated  no  “rational \nconnection between the facts found and the choice made.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (citation \n  53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 55 of 60\nomitted). Defendants have articulated no rational nexus between combatting antisemitism and the \nmedical, scientific, and other research funding at hand. Defendants’ actions are unreasoned and \nunexplained. \n200.  Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because they neglected to \n“take[] into account” the “serious reliance interests” that the awards of funding “engendered.” \nRegents of the Univ. of Calif., 591 U.S. at 30 (quoting Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 \nU.S. 211, 222 (2016)).  For decades, Harvard has relied on the well-established process for federal \nfinancial assistance in its budgeting and financial planning, including with respect to staffing, \ninfrastructure, facility and equipment purchases, and long-term investment decisions. \n201.  Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because they failed to consider \nreasonable, obvious alternatives to an en masse freezes and terminations of Harvard’s federal \nfinancial assistance. See Yakima Valley Cablevision, Inc. v. FCC, 794 F.2d 737, 746 n.36 (D.C. \nCir. 1986). \n202.  Defendants’ Termination Letters constitute an invalid post hoc rationalization. See \nAm. Textile Mfrs. Inst., Inc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981) (“[T]he post hoc rationalizations \nof the agency or the parties to this litigation cannot serve as a sufficient predicate for agency \naction.”).    \n203.  For these reasons and others, Defendants’ actions must be declared unlawful; \nvacated and “set aside” as “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A); and enjoined. \n204.  In the alternative, the Court should postpone the effective dates of the freezes and \nterminations. See 5 U.S.C. § 705. \n  54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 56 of 60\n205.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, Harvard \nwill suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT 6 \nVIOLATION OF STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL AUTHORITY \n(EQUITABLE CAUSE OF ACTION — ULTRA VIRES) \n206.  Harvard incorporates by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n207.  “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is \nthe creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive \naction,  tracing  back  to  England.”  Armstrong,  575  U.S.  at  327.  Accordingly,  even  if  the \nprerequisites of review under the APA were not satisfied, federal “district court[s]” retain the \n“nonstatutory” power “to review agency action that is ultra vires” and provide equitable relief \nunless Congress precludes that review. R.I. Dep’t of Env’t Mgmt., 304 F.3d at 42-43. Congress has \nnot precluded non-statutory judicial review of this agency action. \n208.  As alleged in Count 3, Defendants have no statutory authority to make an end run \naround the procedures mandated by Congress in Title VI. \n209.  Defendants also cannot rely on any inherent constitutional authority under Article \nII of the Constitution to terminate or freeze Harvard’s research funding.  \n210.  Congress  has  appropriated  funds  to  support  research  through  federal  funding \nadministered  by  NIH,  NSF,  NASA,  and  other  agencies.  See,  e.g.,  Further  Consolidated \nAppropriations Act, Pub. L. No. 118-47, 138 Stat. 460, 656-60 (2024) (appropriating funds for \nNIH research); Consolidated Appropriations Act, Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 157-63 (2024) \n(appropriating funds for NSF and NASA research). Because Defendants do not have any inherent \nauthority to terminate or freeze appropriated federal funding to Harvard other than through \nspecified procedures, this Court should declare that their actions are ultra vires. \n  55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 57 of 60\n211.  Defendants also lack any legal basis to prohibit Harvard from seeking future grant \nfunding. Harvard has a protected liberty interest in its reputation as a responsible grant recipient, \nand  Defendants  cannot  revoke  that  interest  without  affording  Harvard  even  “the  slightest \nopportunity to respond to those charges.” Old Dominion Dairy Prods., Inc. v. Sec’y of Def., 631 \nF.2d 953, 964 (D.C. Cir. 1980). Defendants’ actions are therefore ultra vires in contravention of \nHarvard’s right to due process. \n212.  Because Defendants’ actions are ultra vires, this Court should enjoin Defendants \nin their official capacities as federal officers from enforcing the freezes and terminations.  \n213.  If Defendants’ actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined as ultra \nvires, Harvard will suffer substantial, irreparable injury.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nFor these reasons, Plaintiff respectfully requests an order: \na.  expediting the resolution of this action to prevent further harm to Plaintiff; \nb.  declaring unlawful Defendants’ Freeze Orders, Termination Letters, and attendant \nunconstitutional conditions in the April 3, April 11, May 5, May 6, May 9, and May \n12 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes of, or refusals to grant or to \ncontinue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those agency actions; \nc.  vacating and setting aside Defendants’ Freeze Orders, Termination Letters, and \nattendant unconstitutional conditions in the April 3, April 11, May 5, May 6, May \n9, and May 12 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes of, or refusals to grant \nor to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those agency actions;  \nd.  postponing  the  effectiveness  of  the  Freeze  Orders,  Termination  Letters,  and \nattendant unconstitutional conditions in the April 3, April 11, May 5, May 6, May \n  56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 58 of 60\n9, and May 12 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes of, or refusals to grant \nor to continue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those agency actions;  \ne.  permanently enjoining Defendants, their agents, and all persons acting in concert \nor participation with Defendants from implementing, maintaining, or in any way \ngiving  effect  to  the  Freeze  Orders,  Termination  Letters,  and  attendant \nunconstitutional conditions in the April 3, April 11, May 5, May 6, May 9, and May \n12 Letters, as well as any terminations of, freezes of, or refusals to grant or to \ncontinue federal funding undertaken pursuant to those agency actions; \nf.  permanently enjoining Defendants from violating Plaintiff’s First Amendment \nrights; \ng.  permanently enjoining Defendants from terminating, freezing, or refusing to grant \nor to continue any federal funding at issue in this case without complying with \nfederal law, including the requirements of Title VI and agency regulations; \nh.  entering judgment in favor of Plaintiff;  \ni.  awarding Plaintiff its reasonable costs and attorney’s fees in accordance with law, \nincluding but not limited to 42 U.S.C. § 1988; and \nj.  issuing any and all other such relief as the Court deems just and proper. \n   \n  57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-11048-ADB     Document 59     Filed 05/13/25     Page 59 of 60\n   \nDated: May 13, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n   \n  /s/ Steven P.

Defendants’ initial and \nprimary argument in response is that this Court lacks jurisdiction over these claims, all of which \nbelong in the Federal Court of Claims pursuant to the Tucker Act.    \nCurrently before the Court are the parties’ cross motions for summary judgment.  In \nparticular, Harvard and Defendants both move for summary judgment as to all Harvard’s claims.  \n \n \n1 These two related suits are President & Fellows of Harvard College v. United States \nDepartment of Health & Human Services, et al., 25-cv-11048 (D. Mass. April 21, 2025) and \nAmerican Association of University Professors – Harvard Faculty Chapter et al. v. United States \nDepartment of Justice, et al., 25-cv-10910 (D. Mass. April 11, 2025).

[AAUP, \nECF No. 74; AAUP, ECF No. 103].  For the reasons stated herein, Harvard’s motion for \nsummary judgment, [Harvard, ECF No. 69], is GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART; \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, [AAUP, ECF No. 74], is \nGRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART; and Defendants’ motions for summary \njudgment, [Harvard, ECF No. 185; AAUP, ECF No. 103], are GRANTED IN PART and \nDENIED IN PART.     \n3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 4 of 84\nI.  BACKGROUND \nA.  Material Facts2   \n1.  Harvard and its Task Force on Combatting Antisemitism \nHarvard University is the oldest institution of higher learning in the United States and one \nof the world’s leading research universities.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 1].  As of April 14, 2025, as \nrelevant here, Harvard was a recipient of active grants from the following federal agencies: the \nNational Endowment of the Arts (“NEA”); the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”); other \nsubagencies of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”); the National Science \nFoundation (“NSF”); the Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”); the Department of Justice \n(“DOJ”); the Department of Agriculture (“USDA”); the Department of Education (“Department \nof Education”); the Department of Energy (“Energy”); the Department of Defense (“DoD”); the \nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (“NASA”); and the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (“HUD”).  [Id. ¶ 4].3  Harvard’s research programs—funded in part by these \ngovernment grants—serve as training grounds for the next generation of scientific, technological, \nmedical, and public health leaders, with grants supporting the work of more than a thousand \n \n \n2 The Court draws facts from the administrative record, see [Harvard, ECF No. 224], which is \n“the focal point for judicial review,” Camp v. Pitts, 411 U.S. 138, 142 (1973), as well as from the \nparties’ Rule 56.1 statements of facts, as far as they are based on the administrative record, and \nwhich include 1) Defendants’ responses to Harvard’s Statement of Material Facts, [Harvard, \nECF No. 186-1 (“Harvard SOF”)]; 2) Harvard’s responses to Defendants’ Statement of Material \nFacts, [Harvard, ECF No. 212 (“Defendants’ SOF”)]; and 3) Defendants’ responses to AAUP’s \nStatement of Material Facts, [AAUP, ECF No. 105 (“AAUP SOF”)].  With the consent of the \nparties, [Harvard, ECF No. 229 at 9], the Court includes certain facts from outside the \nadministrative record in this fact section.  See Bos. Redevelopment Auth. v. Nat’l Park Serv., \n838 F.3d 42, 48 (1st Cir. 2016).  These are considered infra where relevant or as otherwise \nexplained.   \n3 Although not listed in Harvard’s statement of facts, the record reflects that Harvard also \nreceived grants from the Department of Commerce that were terminated.  See [ECF No. 74-5].  \n4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 5 of 84\ngraduate students and postdoctoral fellows who collectively pioneer life-altering advancements \nthat benefit the nation.  [Id. ¶¶ 2–3]; see also [id. ¶ 2 (“Harvard’s researchers have pioneered life-\naltering advancements in improving cancer prevention and treatment, understanding \nneurodegenerative disorders, creating a new class of antibiotics to treat infections, and studying \nhow spaceflight affects blood cell formation in astronauts.”)]. \nSince Hamas, a well-recognized terrorist organization, violently attacked and kidnapped \nIsraeli citizens on October 7, 2023, Harvard, like many other universities, has experienced \nincreased tensions and violence aimed at its Jewish community.  See generally \n[HHSHarv_0000013–55]; [GSAHarv_00000137–445].  In response, in January 2024, Harvard \nPresident Alan Garber formed a Presidential Task Force on Combatting Antisemitism and Anti-\nIsraeli Bias (the “Harvard Task Force”) and charged it with “identifying the root causes of and \ncontributing factors to bias-based behaviors on campus” and “recommending approaches to \ncombat bias and to mitigate its impact on campus.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 8].  Harvard concurrently \nbegan making policy and other changes aimed at ensuring that its campus is safe and welcoming \nfor Jewish and Israeli students, including: disciplining students and faculty who violate \napplicable policies; enhancing programs and policies designed to address bias and promote \nideological diversity and civil discourse; adopting new accountability procedures and clarified \npolicies, including specifying that protests are not permitted in classrooms, libraries, dormitories, \ndining halls, Harvard offices, and other places where they would interfere with normal university \nactivities; expressly prohibiting unauthorized encampments, exhibits, and displays on campus; \nsupplementing existing safety and security measures; refining procedures and protections for \nreporting misconduct; and making several leadership and personnel changes, all of which were \npublicly announced and widely reported.  [Id. ¶¶ 5–8].  \n5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 6 of 84\n2.  The Federal Task Force to Combat Antisemitism \nOn January 29, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14188, titled “Additional \nMeasures to Combat Anti-Semitism.”  [HHSHarv_00000001].  It requires the heads of all \nexecutive agencies or departments to submit reports identifying all civil and criminal authorities \nor actions within their jurisdictions “that might be used to curb or combat anti-Semitism, and \ncontaining an inventory and analysis of all pending administrative complaints, as of the date of \nthe report, against or involving institutions of higher education alleging civil-rights violations \nrelated to or arising from post-October 7, 2023, campus anti-Semitism.”  [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 1–2].  \nExecutive Order 14188 explicitly reaffirmed Executive Order 13899, which President Trump \nissued during his first term, on December 11, 2019, and which invokes Title VI enforcement as \nthe means for agencies to combat antisemitism on university campuses.  [Id. ¶ 3].4   \nPursuant to Executive Order 14188, on February 3, 2025, DOJ announced the formation \nof a multi-agency Task Force to Combat Antisemitism (“Federal Task Force”), which included \nrepresentatives from the Department of Education, HHS, and other agencies.  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 19].  Senior Counsel to the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Leo Terrell was \nselected to lead the Federal Task Force.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 19]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 4]; [ECF \nNo. 77-1].  Terrell had previously announced, on October 20, 2024, just prior to the election of \nPresident Trump, that “Harvard will lose much more effective January 2025.”  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 20].    \n \n \n4 The full texts of Executive Orders 14188 and 13899 are not part of the administrative record, \nbut the Court takes judicial notice of them, as they are public records.  Watterson v. Page, 987 \nF.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1993) (permitting judicial notice of “official public records”); Michael Cetta, \nInc. v. Admiral Indem. Co., 506 F. Supp. 3d 168, 173 (S.D.N.Y. 2020) (taking judicial notice of \nexecutive orders as public documents or matters of public record). \n6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 7 of 84\nOn March 31, 2025, Harvard received a letter from the Federal Task Force (the “March \n31 Letter”) notifying Harvard of a “review” of more than $8.7 billion in federal funding to \nHarvard.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 21].  The March 31 Letter linked the review of funding to purported \nantisemitism on Harvard’s campus, [id. ¶ 22], stating that it was sent “in light of” the Federal \nTask Force’s “comprehensive review of Federal contracts with certain institutions of higher \neducation that are being investigated for potential infractions and dereliction of duties to curb or \ncombat anti-Semitic harassment,” [GSAHarv_00000003]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 16].  The same \nday, HHS, the Department of Education, and the General Services Administration (“GSA”) also \npublicly announced that they were “reviewing” Harvard’s federal funding for failing to address \nantisemitism.  [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 14–15].  \n3.  The April 3 Letter  \nThe Federal Task Force followed up several days later, on April 3, 2025, with an “official \nnotice” of certain “pre-conditions” that Harvard was required to satisfy to continue receiving \nfederal funding (the “April 3 Letter”).  [Harvard SOF ¶ 23]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 19]; \n[HHSHarv_00000062].  Specifically, the April 3 Letter described “several broad, non-exhaustive \nareas of reform that the government views as necessary for Harvard to implement to remain a \nresponsible recipient of federal taxpayer dollars,” including governance reforms “to foster clear \nlines of authority”; oversight for “biased programs that fuel antisemitism” and to “improve \nviewpoint diversity”; and “shutter[ing]” diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) programs that \n“teach” certain things.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 24]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 20 (restating all nine areas \nof proposed reform verbatim)].  It expressly invoked Title VI, alleging that Harvard had “failed \nto protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and harassment in addition to \nother alleged violations of Title VI and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,” and it called \n7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 8 of 84\nfor “immediate cooperation in implementing these critical reforms” as a prerequisite for \n“Harvard University’s continued financial relationship with the United States government.”  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 25]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 21].  Nowhere in the April 3 Letter did the \ngovernment 1) acknowledge the reforms and commitments Harvard had already made, including \ncommissioning the Harvard Task Force, which issued its report and recommendations shortly \nthereafter, 2) identify any specific instances of antisemitism on Harvard’s campus, or 3) specify \nhow Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way that violated Title VI.  \n[Harvard SOF ¶¶ 26–28]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 22]. \nOn the same day, the government sent Harvard’s counsel an email asking to schedule a \nmeeting, along with an attached document that contained a “[m]enu” of further demands.  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 29].  Many of those demands mirrored those contained in the April 3 Letter, \nsuch as a “choice” between “install[ing] new leadership in problematic depts” and \n“receivership.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 30].  The document also stated that the government sought a \n“[s]enior secured 1st Lien on all Harvard assets which will serve as collateral to pay back \ngovernment from Harvard in event of non-compliance in the future.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 31].  \n4.  The April 11 Letter  \nEight days later, on April 11, 2025, HHS, GSA, and the Department of Education sent \nanother letter to President Garber (the “April 11 Letter”).  [Harvard SOF ¶ 32]; see also [AAUP \nSOF ¶ 23].  The April 11 Letter, which “incorporate[d] and supersede[d]” the April 3 Letter, \nasserted that Harvard had “failed to live up to . . . [the] civil rights conditions that justify federal \ninvestment” and laid out a list of conditions that Harvard had to satisfy to “maintain Harvard’s \nfinancial relationship with the federal government.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 33]; see also [AAUP SOF \n¶ 24].  Specifically, among other demands, the government’s conditions included:  \n8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 9 of 84\n•  “commission[ing] an external party . . . to audit the student body, faculty, staff, and \nleadership for viewpoint diversity, such that each department, field, or teaching unit \nmust be individually viewpoint diverse”;  \n•  “abolish[ing]  all  criteria,  preferences,  and  practices,  whether  mandatory  or \noptional, throughout [Harvard’s] admissions and hiring practices, that function as \nideological litmus tests”; for departments, fields, and teaching units found to “lack \nviewpoint diversity”;  \n•  “hiring a critical mass of new faculty” and “admitting a critical mass of students” \nto provide the government’s preferred balance of viewpoint diversity; “reform[ing] \nand restructuring” governance;  \n•  “reducing the power held by students and untenured faculty,” as well as “the power \nheld by faculty . . . more committed to activism than scholarship”; and  \n•  “shutter[ing]” all DEI programs “through structural and personnel changes.”   \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 34]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 25 (restating demands verbatim)].   \nThe final arbiter of compliance with these conditions would be the federal government, \nwhich would retain the right to audit Harvard (or review final audit reports by third parties) until \nat least the end of 2028.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 35].  Like the April 3 Letter, the April 11 Letter stated \nthat the government expected “immediate cooperation in implementing these critical reforms” if \nthe University wanted to “maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal \ngovernment.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 36]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 26].  Once again, nowhere in the \nApril 11 Letter did the government 1) acknowledge the reforms and commitments Harvard had \nalready made, including around the Harvard Task Force, which by then had issued its \npreliminary recommendations, 2) identify any specific instances of antisemitism on Harvard’s \ncampus, or 3) specify how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way \nthat violated Title VI.  [Harvard SOF ¶¶ 37–39].  \n5.  Harvard’s April 14 Rejection  \nIn short order, on April 14, 2025, Harvard responded with a letter rejecting the terms set \nforth in the April 3 and April 11 Letters.  [HHSHarv_00000104–05]; see also [Harvard SOF \n¶ 41]; [AAUP SOF ¶ 27].  Specifically, Harvard’s rejection letter explained that it remained \n9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 10 of 84\n“committed to fighting antisemitism and other forms of bigotry in its community” and detailed \n“substantial policy and programmatic measures” undertaken in the “past 15 months” to make \nHarvard “a very different place today from where it was a year ago.”  [HHSHarv_00000104].  It \nobjected to the fact that the April 11 Letter “disregard[ed] Harvard’s efforts and instead \npresent[ed] demands that, in contravention of the First Amendment, invade university freedoms \nlong recognized by the Supreme Court.”  [HHSHarv_00000104–05].  Harvard made clear that it \nwould not “accept the government’s terms” because it was “not prepared to agree to demands \nthat go beyond the lawful authority of this or any administration,” and because “[n]either \nHarvard nor any other private university can allow itself to be taken over by the federal \ngovernment.”  [HHSHarv_00000105].  \nThat same day, President Garber reiterated Harvard’s position in a public message to the \nHarvard community, in which he explained that “[a]lthough some of the demands outlined by the \ngovernment are aimed at combating antisemitism, the majority represent direct governmental \nregulation of the ‘intellectual conditions’ at Harvard.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 42].  He reaffirmed that \nHarvard “do[es] not take lightly [its] moral duty to fight antisemitism,” noting the steps Harvard \nhad already taken and would continue to take to fulfill that duty, but also declared that “[n]o \ngovernment—regardless of which party is in power—should dictate what private universities can \nteach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue.”  \n[Id.].   \n6.  The April 14 Freeze Order  \nWithin hours of Harvard’s refusal to comply with the government’s demands, the Federal \nTask Force “announc[ed] a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi-year grants and $60M in multi-year \ncontract value to Harvard University” (the “April 14 Freeze Order”).  [Harvard SOF ¶ 43]; see \n10 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 11 of 84\nalso [AAUP SOF ¶ 31].  The April 14 Freeze Order cited “Harvard’s statement today,” \n[GSAHarv_00000013], as well “[t]he harassment of Jewish students” and “the troubling \nentitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation’s most prestigious universities and colleges—\n[namely,] that federal investment does not come with the responsibility to uphold civil rights \nlaws.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 44]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 31].  It did not acknowledge Harvard’s \ncommunication from earlier that day outlining the measures that Harvard had taken and had \ncommitted to take.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 45].  It also did not identify any specific instances of \nantisemitism on Harvard’s campus or specify how Harvard’s actions violated Title VI.  [Id. \n¶¶ 46–47].  The government issued the April 14 Freeze Order without holding any hearing or \nsubmitting any report to Congress.  [Id. ¶ 48].  \nIn the days following the April 14 Freeze Order, the government immediately began \nsending out stop work orders on certain grants, which required the cessation of all activities \nrelated to those projects, seemingly without regard to the consequences for the projects or the \naffected employees.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 67].  For instance, on April 14, 2025, Robert Foster, \nDeputy General Counsel for HHS, announced to his HHS colleagues that HHS “has taken action \nto pause payments on NIH grants to Harvard University . . . These payments are to remain \npaused until further notice.  This will impact $2.172B in total grant funding . . . across 658 \nindividual grants.”  [AAUP SOF ¶ 61].  On April 16, 2025, DHS terminated two grants “totaling \nover $2.7 million to Harvard University, declaring it unfit to be entrusted with taxpayer dollars.”  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 68].  On April 18, 2025, reports surfaced that the Director of NIH’s Office of \nPolicy for Extramural Research Administration had informed other officials at NIH that the \nagency had “received confirmation from HHS/IOS to hold off on making awards to schools \nwhere the funds have been frozen, i.e., Columbia, Brown, Northwestern, Cornell, Weill-Cornell, \n11 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 12 of 84\nHarvard,” and that “HHS/IOS has stated that we should not provide any communications to these \nschools about whether or why the funds are frozen.”  [Id. ¶ 53].  On April 18 and April 25, 2025, \nJamie French of NSF sent emails to the Vice Provost for Research, John Shaw, stating that NSF \nhad terminated six awards with a face value of $3,287,474.  [AAUP SOF ¶ 73].   \nThe April 14 Freeze Order was also immediately followed by an intensifying public \npressure campaign, including from President Trump, regarding Harvard’s federal funding and \nother federal benefits.  On April 15, 2025, the President posted on social media, “[p]erhaps \nHarvard should lose its Tax Exempt Status and be Taxed as a Political Entity if it keeps pushing \npolitical, ideological, and terrorist inspired/supporting ‘Sickness?’ Remember, Tax Exempt \nStatus is totally contingent on acting in the PUBLIC INTEREST!”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 49]; [AAUP \nSOF ¶ 89].  The next day, the President further criticized Harvard on social media for “hiring \nalmost all woke, Radical Left, idiots,” and declared that Harvard “should no longer receive \nFederal Funds.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 50]; [AAUP SOF ¶ 90].  Within the week, the President again \ndenounced the university as “a Liberal mess,” while referencing this lawsuit.  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 55]; [AAUP SOF ¶ 91].  On May 2, 2025, President Trump posted on social media: “We are \ngoing to be taking away Harvard’s Tax Exempt Status. It’s what they deserve!”  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 56]; [AAUP SOF ¶ 92].   \n7.  The Harvard Task Force Report  \nOn April 29, 2025, the Harvard Task Force released its final 311-page report that noted \n“numerous examples of students, staff, and faculty dedicated to renewing and strengthening the \nHarvard community” but also explicitly acknowledged the “alienating and hostile atmosphere” \nexperienced by many Jewish and Israeli students at Harvard, as well as “instances where \nadministrators and faculty at certain Harvard Schools seemingly fell short in their responsibility \n12 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 13 of 84\nto uphold principles of open inquiry, civility, and respectful disagreement within specific \ncourses, programs, and events.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 9].  To address these troubling findings, the \nHarvard Task Force recommended comprehensive changes to “campus culture and student \nexperience” and “governance” at Harvard.  [Id. ¶ 10].  The report called for changes in nine \nspecific areas related to “campus culture and student experience”: 1) admissions, 2) early student \nexperiences, 3) academics, 4) academic offerings, 5) “co-curricular activities and residential \nlife,” 6) “building a pluralistic community,” 7) religious life, 8) administrative infrastructure, and \n9) “protests, complaints, and discipline.”  [Id.].  The report further recommended that Harvard: \n•  Create a dedicated leadership position “specifically tasked with addressing antisemitism \nand anti-Israel bias”; \n•  Provide students with “substantially more opportunities to learn about antisemitism, \nJewish history and culture, the history and politics of Israel, Zionism, and the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict,” and encourage classes to be cotaught where possible to help \nstudents ground their views “in established facts, rigorous scholarship, and adequately \nconsidered perspectives”; \n•  Develop a channel for informal grievances and anonymous complaints; \n•  Ensure “greater consistency in disciplinary procedures” across Harvard’s schools; and \n•  Provide more oversight by tenured faculty over “educational programs and instructor \ntraining.” \n \n[Id. ¶ 11].  The Harvard Task Force made clear that “the resolutions and the reforms” must come \nfrom Harvard.  [Id. ¶ 12].  If “external parties . . . seek to compel adoption of some of [the] \nproposed reforms,” the report observed, it “will make it more difficult for Harvard to fix itself.”  \n[Id.].  \nAfter the report’s release, President Garber, on behalf of the university, stated that \n“Harvard cannot—and will not—abide bigotry” and that it was committed to “address[ing] with \ndetermination at every level of the University” the challenges identified in the report and would \n“act decisively” to do so.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 13].   \n13 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 14 of 84\nTo that end, since the release of the report, Harvard has taken steps to centralize and \nstrengthen its disciplinary procedures, including by empowering the President to call on a faculty \npanel of the University Committee on Rights and Responsibilities (“UCRR”) to investigate, find \nfacts, and impose discipline where students are alleged to have violated university policies.  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 14].  Harvard’s Academic Council (the president, provost, deans, and other \nsenior leaders) have also “develop[ed] and implement[ed] new recommendations” in order to \n“nurtur[e] a widespread sense of belonging and promot[e] respectful dialogue; revis[e] and \nimplement[] policies, procedures, and training; and strengthen[] academic and residential life.”  \n[Id. ¶ 15].  Harvard’s deans have reviewed recommendations concerning admissions, \nappointments, curriculum, and orientation and training programs, and were directed to submit \n“action plans” by June 2025 for each of Harvard’s schools.  [Id. ¶ 16].  \n8.  The May 5 Freeze Order  \nOn May 5, 2025, approximately one week following the release of the Harvard Task \nForce report, the Secretary of Education sent Harvard another letter (the “May 5 Freeze Order”), \nclaiming that “[i]n every way, Harvard has failed to abide by its legal obligations” and stating \nthat (1)  “Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, since none will \nbe provided,” (2) “Harvard will cease to be a publicly funded institution,” and (3) “today’s letter \nmarks the end of new grants for the University.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 57]; see also [AAUP SOF \n¶ 32].  The May 5 Freeze Order recited the government’s objection to what it characterized as an \nimbalance of viewpoints in Harvard’s governance, reiterated its earlier demands from the April \nletters, and stated that “[t]he Administration’s priorities have not changed.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 58]; \n14 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 15 of 84\nsee also [AAUP SOF ¶ 33].5  Once again, nowhere in the May 5 Freeze Order did the \ngovernment 1) acknowledge the reforms and commitments Harvard had already made, including \ncommissioning the Harvard Task Force and beginning to act on its recommendations, 2) identify \nany specific instances of antisemitism on Harvard’s campus, or 3) specify how Harvard failed to \nrespond to any such acts of antisemitism in a way that violated Title VI.  [Harvard SOF ¶¶ 59–\n61].  The government issued the May 5 Freeze Order without holding any hearing or submitting \nany report to Congress.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 62].  \n9.  The Termination Letters   \nEven before the May 5 Freeze Order, the Federal Task Force and the White House had \ninitiated an effort to identify both the total universe of grants to Harvard and those which were \neligible for termination.  [Harvard SOF ¶¶ 69–70].  Beginning as early as April 30, 2025, GSA, \nin particular, was tasked with coordinating agency efforts to identify grants to Harvard, which \nincluded compiling data points on grants, tracking their gross award value, and providing \ntemplate termination letters.  [May 19, 2025, Declaration of Josh Gruenbaum6  (“Gruenbaum \nDecl.”) ¶ 10]; [AAUP SOF ¶ 34]; [NASA-AR03541 (GSA representative explaining he was \ndirected to “work with agencies to collect a few data points” on grants)].  On May 8, 2025, GSA \nsent Defendant agencies a spreadsheet containing detailed information on 1,056 federal grants to \nHarvard with a total face value of over $2.8 billion.  [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 36–37].  GSA then \nidentified a set of grants at each agency that GSA “asked [the Defendant agencies] to prepare . . . \n \n \n5 On May 12, 2025, President Garber sent a letter to the Secretary of Education in response to the \nMay 5 Freeze Order, explaining that Harvard had implemented “meaningful reform and \nrecommendations designed to eliminate antisemitism and other forms of hate from our campus.”  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 63].  \n6 Although not Bates-stamped, the Gruenbaum Declaration was provided to this Court as part of \nthe parties’ joint administrative record.  [Harvard, ECF No. 224-23 at 52–55].  \n15 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 16 of 84\nfor . . . termination awaiting final greenlight from the White House,” [AAUP SOF ¶ 38]; \n[USDA-HARV-AR-00001]; [GSAHarv_00000125–26], and then provided a template \ntermination letter, [Gruenbaum Decl. ¶ 10], which, in at least one instance, was described as “the \nform the WH wants to see it in,” [USDA-HARV-AR-00084].  Then at least one such proposed \ntermination letter was to be sent to White House officials for “review” by a “WH deadline of \n5pm” on May 8, 2025, [NASA-AR03679, NASA-AR03682], before being sent to Harvard on \nMay 9, 2025, [AAUP SOF ¶ 71].  \nHarvard ultimately received termination letters in early and mid-May from NIH, USDA, \nEnergy, DoD, NSF, HUD, the Department of Education, the Department of Commerce, and the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (collectively, the “Termination Letters”).7  [Harvard \nSOF ¶ 73]; [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 42, 49, 57, 62, 68, 71, 75, 81].  The terminated grants related to all \nmanner of medical, scientific, technological, and other projects—including projects on breast \ncancer detection and prevention, biological threats, overcoming antibiotic resistance, improving \nneurologic outcomes for pediatric cancer survivors, developing drugs to treat long-term radiation \nexposure and for chemotherapy, studying the effects of particulate matter exposure on military \nveterans, and creating “technologies that provide energy-relevant minerals for economic and \nnational security.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 74].   \nAlmost all of the Termination Letters cited a purported change in program goals or \nagency priorities as justification for the terminations and invoked 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), \n \n \n7 The majority of these Termination Letters appear in the administrative record.  \n[DoDHARV_00000039–40]; [EDHarvAR_0000011–12]; [ENERGY AR3932–33, 40–41 \n(duplicate)]; [HHSHarv_00000473–74]; [HUDHarvAR_0000063–64]; [NSF_Harvard000039–\n40]; [USDA-HARV-AR00008–09].  Harvard has submitted two further Termination Letters that \ndo not appear in the record.  [Harvard, ECF Nos. 74-5, 74-6].  \n16 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 17 of 84\nwhich, as discussed further infra, provides that a federal agency may terminate an award \n“pursuant to the terms and conditions of the . . . award, including, to the extent authorized by \nlaw, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 77]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 42, 49, 57, 62, 68].  But see [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 78, 81, 85].  That \nsaid, no termination letter presented any program-specific rationale for the terminations or \nreflected that any program-specific consideration had occurred.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 76]; see also \n[AAUP SOF ¶¶ 46, 53, 59, 65, 69, 72].   In support of the claim that Harvard’s grant awards “no \nlonger effectuate agency priorities,” all but one of the Termination Letters cited to “recent events \nat Harvard University involving antisemitic action,” “Harvard’s ongoing inaction in the face of \nrepeated and severe harassment and targeting of Jewish students,” and Harvard’s “refus[al] to \ntake appropriate action . . . or implement necessary reforms.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 78]; see also \n[AAUP SOF ¶¶ 43–44, 50–51, 57, 63, 69, 72, 74, 76, 83–84].  The Termination Letter that did \nnot cite such concerns contained no explanation as to which agency priorities purportedly had \nchanged or why Harvard’s grant awards no longer aligned with agency priorities.  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 79]; see [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 71–72, 74, 79, 87].  Several of the Termination Letters specifically \nnoted that no modification of the projects “could align the projects with agency priorities” \nbecause Harvard had failed to take “appropriate” action.  [ENERGY AR3932]; [USDA-HARV-\nAR00008]; see also [HHSHarv_00000474 (“[N]o corrective action is possible here.  That is \nbecause . . . the University has refused to take appropriate action.”)].   \nNone of the Termination Letters identified any specific instance of antisemitism on \nHarvard’s campus, specified how Harvard failed to respond to any such acts of antisemitism in a \nway that violated Title VI, or reflected any effort to follow the Title VI procedural requirements \nthat govern the termination of federal funding.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 81] \n17 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 18 of 84\nOn May 13, 2025, the Federal Task Force (which, again, is distinct from the Harvard \nTask Force) issued a press release stating that “Harvard University has repeatedly failed to \nconfront the pervasive race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment plaguing its campus” and \nthat “[t]he Task Force fully supports the Trump Administration’s multi-agency move to cut \nfunding to Harvard, demonstrating the entire Administration’s commitment to eradicating \ndiscrimination on Harvard’s campus.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 64].  The government did not engage \nwith or acknowledge the many reforms and commitments Harvard had already made and \ncommitted to make, nor did it claim to be adhering to Title VI’s detailed procedural \nrequirements.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 64]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶ 94]. \n10.  Examples of Terminated Projects  \nAs a result of the Termination Letters, work has been ordered to stop on a vast number of \nresearch projects across fields that are critical both nationally and worldwide.  There is no \nobvious link between the affected projects and antisemitism.  By way of example (although by \nno means an exhaustive list), Defendants have ordered immunologists overseeing a multi-school \ntuberculosis consortium to immediately stop research, [Harvard SOF ¶ 88]; a researcher at the \nWyss Institute to halt his development of an advanced chip designed to measure NASA \nastronauts’ radiation exposure during the upcoming Artemis II mission to the moon, [id. ¶ 89]; \nand another Wyss Institute scientist, a recipient of the nation’s highest honor for technological \nachievement, to cease his research into Lou Gehrig’s disease, [id. ¶ 90].  Officials at the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs have begun the process of cutting funding for research into, \n18 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 19 of 84\namong other life-saving measures, “a predictive model to help V.A. emergency room physicians \ndecide whether suicidal veterans should be hospitalized.”  [Id. ¶ 91].8 \nHarvard has submitted the details of one such grant termination to illustrate the chaotic \nimpact of Defendants’ rush to terminate funding without first considering its purpose, which \nspecifically involves the Assured Microbial Preservation in Harsh or Remote Areas \n(“AMPHORA”) Program.  AMPHORA is managed by the Defense Advanced Research Projects \nAgency (“DARPA”) and is aimed at increasing awareness of emerging biological threats.  \n[Harvard SOF ¶¶ 84, 86].  A day after sending a termination letter to Harvard on May 12, 2025, \nDoD leadership informed officials at the agency that the Secretary of Defense had directed the \ncancellation of the grants and asked them to issue notices and stop work orders to individual \ngrant recipients.  [Id. ¶ 85].  The director of contracting at DARPA immediately followed up, \nimploring the agency to save the AMPHORA grant.  [Id. ¶¶ 84, 86].  Specifically, he explained \nthat:    \nHarvard  is  currently  the  top  performing  team  on  the  AMPHORA  program. \nInadequate  knowledge  of  the  biological  threat  landscape  poses  grave  and \nimmediate harm to national security.  Development of critical technologies that \nenables  bio  surveillance  and  biocollection  in  austere,  field  forward  locations \nbolsters national security and warfighter safety and lethality by enabling medical \ncountermeasure development to new and emerging threats and provides biological \nthreat intelligence to the deployed warfighter.  This technology is significantly \n \n \n8 The Organizational Plaintiffs’ SOF contains many other facts regarding research projects that \nDefendants do not dispute were terminated, and the Court refers the reader to these as well.  \nThey include, among others, grants related to: the health of young people, [AAUP SOF ¶ 123]; \ntreating tuberculosis, [id. ¶¶ 124, 168]; reducing health disparities, [id. ¶ 134]; the effects of \nantiretroviral treatment for mothers with HIV and their children, [id. ¶ 140]; how different \nchromosomal backgrounds result in different risk for disease, [id. ¶ 146]; the health effects of \nenvironmental exposures on brain health, [id. ¶ 154]; how diets and lifestyle relate to cancer risk, \n[id. ¶ 162]; the effects of microgravity and radiation on astronauts, [id. ¶ 175]; understanding the \nneural circuits underlying motor skills, [id. ¶ 184]; and the impact of climate change-related heat \nstress on people worldwide, [id. ¶ 192].  \n \n19 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 20 of 84\noutpacing the state-of-the art and provides a novel leap-ahead capability to the \nforce.  Harvard’s effort is at a pivotal juncture in Phase 1 as they are just starting \nthe microfluidic experiments that will give first indications of whether the program \ngoal is achievable.  They are also a critical integrator of multiple technologies that \nenable this effort and could not be readily reproduced. \n \n[Id. ¶ 86].  Although nothing in the administrative record indicates that the Secretary of Defense \nacted on the DARPA director’s request, [id. ¶ 87], and despite the termination notice from the \ngovernment, DARPA personnel continued to engage with Harvard researchers, including \nrequesting samples and a research update, [Harvard, ECF No. 221 (“Suppl. Shaw Decl.”) ¶ 4].  \nSince it was continuing to work on the project at the direction of DARPA, Harvard requested \npayment, submitting a “Request for Advance or Reimbursement” for approximately $373,000 to \nDARPA on July 2, 2025.  [Id. ¶ 5].  This reflected work performed on the AMPHORA project \nfrom May 1 through May 31, 2025, some of which was performed after the grant was \npurportedly terminated on May 12, 2025.  [Id.].  On July 2, 2025, Harvard sent an email to the \nDirector of DARPA’s Contracts Management Office, asking DARPA to confirm whether the \nAMPHORA grant was still active, but received no response.  [Id. ¶ 6].  Harvard did, however, \nreceive full payment from DARPA for the July 2 invoice on July 8, 2025.  [Id. ¶ 7].  \n11.  Grant Terminations and Threats Thereof Continue   \nAfter the flurry of termination letters in early- and mid-May 2025, the government’s \nbroadscale reductions in federal funding to Harvard continued.  On May 20, 2025, HHS \nannounced it was cutting an additional $60 million in multiyear grants to Harvard.  [Harvard \nSOF ¶ 92].  On May 27, 2025, GSA targeted approximately $100 million in contracts, instructing \nagencies to “consider [their] contracts with Harvard University and determine whether Harvard \nand its services efficiently promote the priorities of the agency.”  [Id. ¶ 94].  Since Defendants \nfirst began sending the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters, Harvard has received notices of \n20 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 21 of 84\ntermination for over 950 already-awarded federal research projects, [id. ¶ 82], including some \nnotices that were received after the filing of the Amended Complaint, [id. ¶ 83].  \nFurther, the government has continued to pressure Harvard in other ways.  As examples, \non May 26, 2025, the President stated that he was considering taking away “Three Billion \nDollars” from “a very antisemitic Harvard,” which he would then give to “TRADE SCHOOLS.”  \n[Harvard SOF ¶ 93].  On May 28, 2025, Defendant McMahon described the government’s \nfunding conversations with Harvard to date, stating:  \nWhen we looked at different aspects of what Harvard was doing relative to anti-\nSemitism on its campuses they were not enforcing Title VI the way it should be. \nAnd we had conversations with President Garber and I expected that we would have \nmore, but Harvard’s answer was a lawsuit so that’s where we find ourselves . . . I \nthink the President is looking at this as, OK, how, how can we really make our \npoint, and what are the things that Harvard and other universities are doing that we, \nthat we have to call attention to?  \n \n[AAUP SOF ¶ 95].  That same day, during an interview in the Oval Office, President Trump said \nthat Harvard is “hurting [itself]” by “fighting,” and noted that “Columbia has been, really, and \nthey were very, very bad . . . . But they’re working with us on finding a solution.”  [Harvard SOF \n¶ 95].  He further stated that Harvard “wants to fight. They want to show how smart they are, and \nthey’re getting their ass kicked”; “every time [Harvard] fight[s], they lose another $250 million”; \nand “[a]ll they’re doing is getting in deeper and deeper and deeper.”  [Id.].   \nB.  Procedural History   \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs sued first, filing a complaint and a motion for a temporary \nrestraining order on April 11, 2025, [AAUP, ECF Nos. 1, 4], although they withdrew the motion \nfor a temporary restraining order on April 15, 2025, [AAUP, ECF Nos. 27, 29].  Harvard filed its \naction on April 21, 2025.  [Harvard, ECF No. 1].  The Organizational Plaintiffs have since filed \ntwo amended complaints, one on May 5, 2025, [AAUP, ECF No. 50], and the other on May 20, \n21 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 22 of 84\n2025, [AAUP, ECF No. 64].  Harvard filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2025, [Harvard, \nECF No. 59].  \nThe Court held a status conference on April 28, 2025, at which time the parties elected to \nproceed directly to summary judgment.  [Harvard, ECF No. 47].  Pursuant to an agreed upon \nexpedited briefing schedule, Plaintiffs filed their motions for summary judgment on June 2, \n2025, [Harvard, ECF No. 69; AAUP, ECF No. 74]; Defendants opposed and filed cross motions \nfor summary judgment on June 16, 2025, [Harvard, ECF No. 185; AAUP, ECF No. 103]; \nPlaintiffs replied on June 30, 2025, [Harvard, ECF No. 211; AAUP, ECF No. 110]; and \nDefendants replied on July 14, 2025. [Harvard, ECF No. 223; AAUP, ECF No. 130].   \nII.  LEGAL STANDARD \nSummary judgment is normally appropriate if the movant can show that “there is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  “However, in cases involving review of agency action under the \n[Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”)], the traditional Rule 56 standard does not apply due to \nthe limited role of a court in reviewing the administrative record.”  Bennett v. Murphy, 166 F. \nSupp. 3d 128, 139 (D. Mass. 2016) (citing Int’l Jr. Coll. of Bus. and Tech., Inc. v. Duncan, 802 \nF.3d 99, 106 (1st Cir. 2015)).  In particular, for summary judgment motions under the APA, the \nCourt’s review is ordinarily “limited to the administrative record,” Lovgren v. Locke, 701 F.3d \n5, 20 (1st Cir. 2012), and “[t]he ‘entire case’ on review is a question of law,” Am. Bioscience, \nInc. v. Thompson, 269 F.3d 1077, 1083 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (citation omitted); id. (“[W]hen a party \nseeks review of agency action under the APA, the district judge sits as an appellate tribunal.”); \nsee also Doe v. U.S. Citizenship & Immigr. Servs., 239 F. Supp. 3d 297, 305 (D.D.C. 2017) \n(“Summary judgment is [] the mechanism for deciding whether as a matter of law the agency \n22 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 23 of 84\naction is supported by the administrative record and is otherwise consistent with the APA \nstandard of review.” (citation omitted)).   \n  Judicial review of an APA claim “is narrow” because “the APA standard affords great \ndeference to agency decisionmaking and because the [agency’s] action is presumed valid.”  \nAssociated Fisheries of Me., Inc. v. Daley, 127 F.3d 104, 109 (1st Cir. 1997).  “Under this \ndeferential standard of review, a court may set aside an administrative action if that action is \n“arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise contrary to law.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A).  When reviewing such an action, the Court “may not substitute [its] judgment for \nthat of the agency, even if [it] disagree[s] with [the agency’s] conclusions.”  Sig Sauer, Inc. v. \nBrandon, 826 F.3d 598, 601 (1st Cir. 2016) (quoting Craker v. DEA, 714 F.3d 17, 26 (1st Cir. \n2013)).   \nIII.  DISTRICT COURT JURISDICTION \nAs a threshold matter, Defendants assert that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction \nover Plaintiffs’ claims because the waiver of sovereign immunity in the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 702, \ndoes not extend to contract actions, which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United \nStates Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491.  [Harvard, ECF No. 47 \nat 6–8]; [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 22–28].  Plaintiffs, who contend they have brought a proper \nchallenge under the APA, disagree that the Tucker Act divests this Court of jurisdiction.  \n[Harvard, ECF No. 19 at 24–29]; [Harvard, ECF No. 53 at 7–10]; [AAUP, ECF No. 75 at 28–\n31]; [AAUP, ECF No. 110 at 13–16].  \nThe APA “confers a general cause of action upon persons ‘adversely affected or \naggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.’”  Block v. Cmty. Nutrition \nInst., 467 U.S. 340, 345 (1984) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  The APA’s waiver of sovereign \n23 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 24 of 84\nimmunity, however, “does not apply ‘if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or \nimpliedly forbids the relief which is sought.’”  Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 968 \n(2025) (per curiam) (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 702).  As relevant here, the Tucker Act vests jurisdiction \nin the Court of Federal Claims over “any claim against the United States founded either upon the \nConstitution, or any Act of Congress or any regulation of an executive department, or upon any \nexpress or implied contract with the United States, or for liquidated or unliquidated damages in \ncases not sounding in tort.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  Although “[t]he ‘jurisdictional boundary’ \nbetween the Tucker Act and [the APA] is well-traversed by litigants seeking relief against the \nfederal government . . . the boundary’s precise contours remain elusive,” Massachusetts v. Nat’l \nInsts. of Health, 770 F. Supp. 3d 277, 292 (D. Mass. 2025) (quoting Suburban Mortg. Assocs., \nInc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urb. Dev., 480 F.3d 1116, 1117 (Fed. Cir. 2007)), even following \nrecent rulings by the Supreme Court on its emergency docket.   \nDefendants maintain that the instant cases must be sent to the Court of Federal Claims \nbecause it “is, after all, about the money.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 223 at 14]; see also [Harvard, \nECF No. 186 at 26 (“This case is about money.”)].  As Defendants acknowledge, however, \nwhether a case is, in some sense, “about the money” is not necessarily dispositive of the issue of \njurisdiction.  See, e.g., [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 27 (explaining the “essential facts” involve \nwhether “Harvard is seeking to enforce contractual rights and is seeking contractual remedies”)].  \nLongstanding precedent indicates that monetary disputes against the government may, in some \ncircumstances, play out in Article III courts.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 900–01 \n(1988) (“The fact that the mandate is one for the payment of money must not be confused with \nthe question whether such payment, in these circumstances, is a payment of money as damages \nor as specific relief.”).  The parties agree that the determinative jurisdictional question is \n24 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 25 of 84\n“[w]hether [the Plaintiffs’] claim is ‘at its essence’ contractual,” which “‘depends both on the \nsource of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought \n(or appropriate).’”  Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. Admin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (quoting Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982)).  In other \nwords, for present purposes and simply put, contract claims against the federal government must \nbe brought in the Court of Federal Claims, but claims that do not sound in contract or seek \ncontract-based relief stay in federal district court.  \nWith regards to the instant case, Defendants contend that “[h]ere, both factors support a \nfinding that the Court lacks jurisdiction over what are essentially claims that lie in contract \nbecause: 1) the source of Harvard’s right to funds previously awarded are grant and contract \nagreements, and 2) the relief sought in this case amounts to the remaining, undisbursed value of \nthose agreements.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 30]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 24, 27].  \nPlaintiffs disagree and maintain that their action “arises from the [g]overnment’s violation of \nrights protected by the Constitution and federal statutes, not the terms of any express or implied \ncontract with the United States,” [Harvard, ECF No. 211 at 12], and seeks “‘neither the \nprototypical contractual remedy of damages’ nor the ‘classic contractual remedy of specific \nperformance,’” [id. at 15 (quoting Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1110)]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. 110 at \n13–15].  In response, Defendants accuse Plaintiffs of “artful pleading,” ultimately contending \nthat “the underlying rights [Harvard] seeks to enforce are based in contract and the relief sought \nwould have the effect of compelling the government to pay money.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 223 at \n7]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 27 (asserting that Plaintiffs are “attempt[ing] to disguise \ntheir claims as ones for forward-looking equitable relief from conduct in violation of” \nconstitutional and statutory rights (citation omitted))].   \n25 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 26 of 84\nAfter the summary-judgment motions in this case were fully briefed, the Supreme Court \nissued a per curiam stay order in National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health \nAssociation (“APHA”), No. 25A103, 2025 WL 2415669 (Aug. 21, 2025) (per curiam), which \nconcerned the termination of approximately $800 million in NIH grants.  The issues were \nwhether the district court likely had jurisdiction to vacate NIH guidance documents and/or to \nfind the individual grant terminations to be arbitrary and capricious under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \nUltimately, a very divided Court bifurcated the issue.  Namely, the Court stayed those portions of \nthe district court’s orders that vacated the grant terminations, but otherwise denied the \ngovernment’s stay application, leaving intact the district court’s vacatur of the agency guidance \ndocuments.  APHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1.  In a (controlling) concurrence, Justice Barrett \nexplained that, although the district court had jurisdiction to vacate the NIH guidance documents \nthat set out agency funding priorities, it “likely lacked jurisdiction to hear challenges to the grant \nterminations, which belong in the Court of Federal Claims.”  Id. at *2 (Barrett, J. concurring in \nthe partial grant of the application for stay); see also Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 \n(1977) (“When a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result \nenjoys the assent of five Justices, ‘the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken \nby those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.’” (quoting Gregg \nv. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153, 169 n.15 (1976))).  She reasoned that “[b]oth logic and law . . . support \nchanneling challenges to the grant terminations and guidance to different forums.”  APHA, 2025 \nWL 2415669, at *2.  As to logic, Justice Barrett explained that “[v]acating the guidance does not \nreinstate the terminated grants,” noting that “[i]f one simply flowed from the other, the District \nCourt would have needed only to vacate the guidance itself,” rather than separately vacating the \ngrant terminations as it did.  Id.  As to law, Justice Barrett wrote that “[e]ven if the guidance and \n26 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 27 of 84\ngrant terminations are linked, vacating the guidance does not necessarily void decisions made \nunder it” such that “the claims are legally distinct.”  Id.  \nPlaintiffs here bring substantially similar arbitrary and capricious claims pursuant to 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A), through which they challenge both the Freeze Orders and Termination \nLetters, and ask the Court to vacate and set aside both the guidance within those documents and, \nseparately, the resulting grant terminations.  [Harvard, ECF No. 59 at Prayer for Relief]; see also \n[AAUP, ECF No. 64 at Prayer for Relief].  In light of the Supreme Court’s per curiam decision \nin APHA, the Court holds that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious claims \nthat challenge the Freeze Orders, because it views those orders, as discussed further infra, as \nagency guidance documents that set the federal government’s policy moving forward as to grant \nfunding at Harvard.  It also holds, however, that, given the current guidance from the Supreme \nCourt, it lacks jurisdiction over the arbitrary and capricious claims as they pertain to the \nTermination Letters, and that any such claim based on the grant terminations must be brought in \nthe Court of Federal Claims.   \nThat said, while this Court is endeavoring to follow the Supreme Court’s reasoning in \nAPHA,9 the per curiam opinion in APHA, like the Supreme Court’s prior decision in California, \n \n \n9 The Court is mindful of Justice Gorsuch’s comments in his opinion in APHA and fully agrees \nthat this Court is not free to “defy” Supreme Court decisions and is, in fact, “duty-bound to \nrespect ‘the hierarchy of the federal court system.’”  APHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *3 (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citation omitted).  Consistent with these obligations, \nthis Court (and likely all district courts) endeavors to follow the Supreme Court’s rulings, “no \nmatter how misguided [it] may think [them] to be.”  Hutto v. Davis, 454 U.S. 370, 375 (1982) \n(per curiam).  That said, the Supreme Court’s recent emergency docket rulings regarding grant \nterminations have not been models of clarity, and have left many issues unresolved.  California \nwas a four-paragraph per curiam decision issued in the context of a stay application.  It cited \nBowen as good law, stated that the Tucker Act gave the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction \nover contract claims against the federal government, and then stated that the district court likely \n \n27 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 28 of 84\ninvolved only arbitrary and capricious claims brought under § 706(2)(A).  Plaintiffs here have \nalso brought and seek summary judgment on APA claims based on the First Amendment and \nviolations of Title VI pursuant to § 706(2)(B) and (C), which seem to this Court materially \ndifferent from the more contract-based claims asserted in California and APHA.    \nFirst, the rights at issue in First Amendment and Title VI claims do not ordinarily fall \nwithin the ambit of the Tucker Act, which is very specifically contract-focused.  As to the First \nAmendment, “[t]he Tucker Act confers subject matter jurisdiction to [the] Court [of Federal \nClaims] over money-mandating constitutional claims . . . [and t]he Federal Circuit has expressly \nheld the Court of Federal Claims lacks jurisdiction over claims arising under the First \nAmendment . . . as they are not money-mandating.”  Stephens v. United States, 165 Fed. Cl. 341, \n348 (2023).  Nor does the Tucker Act’s waiver of sovereign immunity strike the Court as \nrelevant to Title VI, which itself expressly authorizes “judicial review” of agency action \n \n \nlacked jurisdiction “to order the payment of money under the APA,” without purporting to \nexplain how the case was distinguishable from Bowen or other related, longstanding precedents.  \nCalifornia, 145 S. Ct. at 968.  Then, in APHA, four justices thought grant-termination cases \nbelong, in full, in the Court of Federal Claims, and four justices thought they belong, in full, in \nfederal district court, and the decision was controlled by the vote of a single justice.  2025 WL \n2415669, at *1–16.  The outcome, which no party had requested, was, thus, inconsistent with the \nviews of eight justices, id. at *16 (Jackson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and, \nagain, provided little explanation as to how Bowen, which the controlling concurrence again \ncited as good law, id. at *2, applied or was distinguishable.  This Court understands, of course, \nthat the Supreme Court, like the district courts, is trying to resolve these issues quickly, often on \nan emergency basis, and that the issues are complex and evolving.  See Trump v. CASA, Inc., \n145 S. Ct. 2540, 2567 (2025) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“In justiciable cases, this Court, not \nthe district courts or courts of appeals, will often still be the ultimate decisionmaker as to the \ninterim legal status of major new federal statutes and executive actions.”).  Given this, however, \nthe Court respectfully submits that it is unhelpful and unnecessary to criticize district courts for \n“defy[ing]” the Supreme Court when they are working to find the right answer in a rapidly \nevolving doctrinal landscape, where they must grapple with both existing precedent and interim \nguidance from the Supreme Court that appears to set that precedent aside without much \nexplanation or consensus.   \n \n28 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 29 of 84\n“terminating or refusing to grant or to continue financial assistance,” including through the APA, \nin an Article III court.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2; see also Colwell v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n558 F.3d 1112, 1128 (9th Cir. 2009) (“Judicial review of any [Title VI] funding termination is \navailable in an Article III court.”); Adams v. Bell, 711 F.2d 161, 189 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (Wright, \nJ., dissenting) (noting that “the traditional mode” for review under 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-2 is “the \nAPA”).   \nSecond, Plaintiffs seek relief beyond enforcement of an “‘obligation to pay money’ \npursuant to . . . grants.”  APHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *1 (citation omitted).  They seek \nprospective relief that, among other things, mandates that Defendants comply with the First \nAmendment and Title VI’s procedural requirements.  Because of this, the Court of Federal \nClaims, if confronted with Plaintiffs’ First Amendment and Title VI claims, could not “fully \nadjudicate the claims over which it [would have] jurisdiction,” id. at *2 n.1 (Barrett, J., \nconcurring), as it “does not have the general equitable powers” to grant prospective injunctive \nrelief, Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. 296, 327 (2020).   \nThird, the logical and legal considerations underlying the APHA decision, as explained in \nJustice Barrett’s concurrence, do not graft cleanly onto Plaintiffs’ First Amendment and Title VI \nclaims, which likely makes splitting the claims between two forums procedurally unworkable.  \nBifurcating the APA claims as to the guidance and the terminations was possible in APHA \nbecause vacating the guidance as arbitrary did not necessarily render the terminations arbitrary.  \nAPHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2.  In other words, the guidance and the terminations did not \nneed to rise or fall together.  This is what required the district court to enter two separate orders, \none vacating the guidance and the other vacating the terminations, and what then allowed the \nSupreme Court to put the two issues on separate tracks going forward.  In contrast, if this Court \n29 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 30 of 84\nwere to grant summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their First Amendment and Title VI claims, it \nwould not have to issue separate orders.  Rather, assuming a First Amendment violation, it could \nissue a single order invalidating Defendants’ course of unlawful conduct, which would include \nboth the Freeze Orders and the Termination Letters.  Similarly, as to Title VI, it could issue an \norder addressing the Termination Letters but stand silent on the Freeze Orders, as the Title VI \nviolations would be the termination decisions rather than the freezes.  See Bowen, 487 U.S. at \n911 (reviewing court need not “split” case into “two parts” where it “had the authority to hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action that it found to be not in accordance with law” (citation \nomitted)); APHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2 (citing Bowen as distinct from APHA and \ncharacterizing Bowen as involving “one judgment vacating HHS decision”).10  In other words, as \nto the First Amendment, the Termination Letters are not “legally distinct” as they constitute part \nof the pattern of retaliatory conduct and, as to the Title VI claim, the Termination Letters form \nthe sole basis of the claim.  Cf. APHA, 2025 WL 2415669, at *2.  \nIt may well be that these differences would not distinguish these claims in the eyes of the \nSupreme Court, although that remains unclear under existing caselaw.  But this is not Calvinball \nand there are rules.  Under those rules, which are set by existing Supreme Court precedent, this \nCourt cannot conclude that core First Amendment claims or pure statutory violations fall within \nthe exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims.  A contract claim is, by its nature about \nmoney and, for present purposes, whether the government is obligated to pay money under a \n \n \n10 California is also not dispositive on these issues as it did not involve a Title VI claim and \nbecause, in the underlying preliminary-injunction decision, the district court “did not reach the \nlikelihood of success as to any constitutional claims,” including claims brought under the First \nAmendment.  Thakur v. Trump, No. 25-cv-04737, 2025 WL 1734471, at *21 (N.D. Cal. June 23, \n2025). \n30 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 31 of 84\ncontract.  The First Amendment claims here are about speech and whether the federal \ngovernment is improperly infringing on the free speech rights of an academic institution and its \nemployees.  The resolution of these claims might result in money changing hands, but what is \nfundamentally at issue is a bedrock constitutional principle rather than the interpretation of \ncontract terms.  Similarly, resolution of the Title VI claims here will merely determine whether \nstatutory procedural requirements were satisfied.  Regardless of how these claims are resolved, \nthe government will not necessarily be obligated to disburse any additional funds nor will any \ncontract terms need to be considered as part of the analysis.     \nGiven the nature of the First Amendment claims (purely constitutional) and the Title VI \nclaims (statutory), these claims do not belong in the Court of Federal Claims, which in any event, \ncannot fully adjudicate either set of claims.  Under these circumstances, the Megapulse factors \ntip to Plaintiffs.  This Court therefore holds that it has jurisdiction over Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment and Title VI challenges as to both the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters, as \nwell as over Plaintiffs’ arbitrary and capricious challenges to the Freeze Orders (but not the \nTermination Letters).11  \n \n \n11 Defendants move for summary judgment as to the Organizational Plaintiffs’ separation of \npowers claims (Counts V and VI) and due process claims (Counts VII and VIII), each pair of \nwhich is fashioned as both an APA claim and an ultra vires claim.  For similar reasons as those \narticulated herein, and given the Defendants’ limited focus on these causes of action in their \nsummary judgment briefing, see [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 22–28, 47–52], the Court, on this \nrecord, is hesitant to find that the Court of Federal Claims has jurisdiction over these APA \nclaims.  More specifically, the Organizational Plaintiffs request the same relief for these claims \nas for their APA claims for violations of the First Amendment and Title VI; the rights at issue are \nconstitutional and do not require the Court to consider to the terms of the grants; both claims are \nbrought pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B); and at least the separation of powers claim appears to \nbe premised solely on the Freeze Orders, not the grant terminations, [AAUP, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 338 \n(“None of the funds received by Harvard University have a congressionally authorized condition \nrequiring them to comply with any of the demands in the April 3, April 11, or May 5 Letters or \n \n31 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 32 of 84\nIV.  STANDING \nThe Constitution gives the judiciary power to hear “Cases” and “Controversies.”  U.S. \nConst. art. III, § 2, cl. 1.  The Supreme Court has interpreted this language to mean that courts \nmay decide only “cases and controversies of the sort traditionally amenable to, and resolved by, \nthe judicial process.”  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, 523 U.S. 83, 102 (1998).  A \nplaintiff’s standing to sue is “part of the common understanding of what it takes to make a \njusticiable case.”  Id.  Therefore, “the absence of standing sounds the death knell for a case.”  \nMicrosystems Software, Inc. v. Scandinavia Online AB, 226 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2000). The \nstanding determination is “claim-specific,” meaning that an individual plaintiff “must have \nstanding to bring each and every claim that [he or] she asserts.”  Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d \n64, 71 (1st Cir. 2012). \nArticle III standing requires that three conditions be satisfied.  “First and foremost, there \nmust be alleged (and ultimately proved) an ‘injury in fact.’”  Steel Co., 523 U.S. at 103 (quoting \nWhitmore v. Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 155 (1990)).  This injury “must be concrete in both a \nqualitative and temporal sense,” “distinct and palpable” as opposed to “abstract,” and “actual or \nimminent” as opposed to “conjectural or hypothetical.”  Whitmore, 495 U.S. at 155 (citation \nmodified).  Second, standing requires causation, defined as a “fairly traceable connection \nbetween the plaintiff’s injury and the complained-of conduct of the defendant.”  Steel Co., 523 \n \n \nthat subject them to review in the manner Defendants have undertaken as alleged herein.”)].  \nThis Court likewise retains jurisdiction over the ultra vires versions of these claims, pursuant to \nits “equitable power[]” to “enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers.”  \nArmstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327–28 (2015).  That said, this Court \nrecognizes that if it is incorrect in its assessment that it can exercise jurisdiction over APA claims \npremised on Title VI and the First Amendment, the Organizational Plaintiffs’ separation of \npowers and due process claims may likewise need to be adjudicated, at least in part, in the Court \nof Federal Claims.   \n32 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 33 of 84\nU.S. at 103.  Finally, standing requires “redressability—a likelihood that the requested relief will \nredress the alleged injury.”  Id. \nDefendants contend that the Organizational Plaintiffs “lack standing as they have not \nshown sufficient harm to themselves or their members resulting from the agencies’ actions,” as \nthey “are not parties to the grants issued to Harvard, lack any protected interest, and fail to \nestablish any legally cognizable harm.”  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 13].12  The Organizational \nPlaintiffs counter that they “have standing based on both injuries to their members—whose \nresearch funding has been cut with disastrous impacts and whose speech and academic freedom \nare chilled—and injuries [the Organizational] Plaintiffs have incurred directly.”  [AAUP, ECF \nNo. 75 at 21].   \nThe Court finds that the Organizational Plaintiffs have Article III standing to assert the \nclaims in their Amended Complaint against Defendants.  “[A]n association may have standing \nsolely as the representative of its members even in the absence of injury to itself, in certain \ncircumstances.”  Camel Hair & Cashmere Inst. of Am., Inc. v. Associated Dry Goods Corp., 799 \nF.2d 6, 10 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511 (1975)).  Specifically, “an \nassociation has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members when: (a) its members would \notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires \nthe participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”   Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. \n \n \n12 Defendants also argue that the Organizational Plaintiffs lack standing to “enforce payments” \non “agreements that do not belong to them” but instead belong to non-party Harvard.  [AAUP, \nECF No. 104 at 20–22].  For the reasons discussed in determining that the Tucker Act does not \nforeclose jurisdiction, the Organizational Plaintiffs’ suit is largely not one to enforce payments \nunder a contract; rather, it is one for injunctive relief to remedy constitutional and statutory \nviolations.  \n33 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 34 of 84\nComm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  The first two Hunt prongs are constitutional, and the third \nis prudential.  United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 \nU.S. 544, 555–57 (1996).  Only one member of an organization need have individual standing \nfor that organization to satisfy the first Hunt factor.  See Playboy Enters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. \nComm’n of P.R., 906 F.2d 25, 34 (1st Cir. 1990) (“[T]he Supreme Court has never required that \nevery member of an association have standing before it can sue on behalf of its members. ‘The \nassociation must allege that its members, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or \nthreatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable \ncase had the members themselves brought suit.’” (emphasis omitted) (quoting Warth, 422 U.S. at \n511)). \nAs to the first Hunt prong, the Organizational Plaintiffs point to three harms that its \nmembers have suffered that they contend are sufficient for Article III standing.  [AAUP, ECF \nNo. 75 at 22–23].  First, some of the Organizational Plaintiffs’ members “have been forced to \ncease research activities and have not been able to resume them, causing them ‘continuing direct \ninjury’ sufficient to support a request for injunctive relief.”  [Id. at 22 (quoting Ocasio v. City of \nLawrence, 788 F. Supp. 99, 100 (D. Mass. 1992))].  Second, “Defendants terminated funding \nsupporting many of [the Organizational] Plaintiffs’ other members, who expect to immediately \nexperience these same harms once they exhaust their limited, short-term funds.”  [Id. at 23].  \nThird, “Defendants have chilled some of the [Organizational] Plaintiffs’ members’ protected \nspeech and academic freedom,” as the Organizational “Plaintiffs’ members have begun to avoid \nspeech and subject matter[s] that might draw the wrath of the Trump administration directly or \ncause them to become the University’s next target in its concession to Defendants’ demands.”  \n[Id. at 24].  \n34 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 35 of 84\nDefendants do not appear to contest that the first two harms the Organizational Plaintiffs \nhave identified constitute injury in fact; rather, they assert that the Organizational Plaintiffs’ \nmembers lack standing as “redressability and causation are lacking,” where “[the Organizational] \nPlaintiffs’ members [have] alleged personal harms that are too attenuated to support jurisdiction \nbecause any asserted harms must flow from independent choices made by the nonparty \neducational institution (Harvard), or their injury is otherwise too speculative.”  [AAUP, ECF No. \n104 at 17].  Specifically, Defendants contend that “[u]ltimately, it is the choice of a nonparty, \nHarvard, whose funding was cut, to determine what to do.  If, for example, Harvard chooses to \ncontinue funding the project, then no harm flows to Plaintiffs’ members from the termination.”  \n[Id. at 18].   \n“The Supreme Court has explained that the fairly traceable standard requires ‘a causal \nconnection between the injury and the conduct complained of.’”  Conservation L. Found., Inc. v. \nAcad. Express, LLC, 129 F.4th 78, 90 (1st Cir. 2025) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560).  It does \nnot, however, require “a tort-like showing of proximate causation,” and, as such, “[a] plaintiff \ncan satisfy traceability by showing that the defendant’s conduct is one among multiple causes of \nthe alleged injury.”  Id. (citation omitted).  “[W]hen (as here) a plaintiff challenges the \ngovernment’s ‘unlawful regulation . . . of someone else’ . . . causation ‘ordinarily hinge[s] on the \nresponse of the regulated (or regulable) third party to the government action or inaction—and \nperhaps on the response of others as well.’”  Food & Drug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., \n602 U.S. 367, 383 (2024) (quoting Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562).  “Therefore, to thread the causation \nneedle in those circumstances, the plaintiff must show that the ‘third parties will likely react in \npredictable ways’ that in turn will likely injure the plaintiffs.”  Id. (quoting California v. Texas, \n593 U.S. 659, 675 (2021)).  Thus, “[t]he causation requirement precludes speculative links—that \n35 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 36 of 84\nis, where it is not sufficiently predictable how third parties would react to government action or \ncause downstream injury to plaintiffs, as well as “attenuated links—that is, where the \ngovernment action is so far removed from its distant (even if predictable) ripple effects that the \nplaintiffs cannot establish Article III standing.”  Id.  \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs have adequately demonstrated that their members’ harms \nare fairly traceable to Defendants’ conduct.  Although the Court recognizes that Defendants’ \nactions ultimately impact grant agreements that are awarded, in name, to the “President and \nFellows of Harvard College,” see, e.g., [NSF_Harvard000681], the notion that the resultant harm \nto professors and graduate students is at best speculative or attenuated is divorced from the \nreality of how federal research grants function.  The professors and graduate students—who are \nresponsible for funding their own research—apply for federal grants, are awarded the grants on \nthe strength of their credentials and proposed research, and then build their professional \nreputations on those grants.  See, e.g., [AAUP, ECF No. 77-16 ¶ 2 ([“I]n 1992 I applied for and \nreceived a prestigious Special Emphasis Research Career Award to work on the Human Genome \nProject. I have had continuous federal funding to support my research ever since.”)]; [AAUP, \nECF No. 77-22 ¶¶ 6–9 (describing process of research scientist applying for grants)].  As such, it \nis their names that appear directly on the face of the grant agreements, their labs that receive the \nfunding, and their research that is eliminated when funding is discontinued.  See, e.g., \n[NSF_Harvard000060 (noting that the PI and Site Director, whose name is redacted, is the \n“Mallinkckrodt Professor of Applied Physics and Physics,” who “has ultimate responsibility for \nimplementation of all aspects” of the grant)].  To that end, at least one AAUP member received \nnotice directly from the federal government that his research was to stop.  [AAUP SOF ¶ 176]; \nsee also [DoDHarv_00000005 (“Attached is a copy of the grant termination notice.  Please \n36 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 37 of 84\nensure the Principal Investigator, courtesy copied herein, receives a copy of this document.”)]; \ncf. Am. Ass’n of Univ. Professors v. U.S. Dep’t of Just. (“AAUP”), No. 25-cv-2429, 2025 WL \n1684817, at *6 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2025) (“Indeed, Plaintiffs’ evidence reflects that all \ncommunication about the termination of grants has been either between an executive agency and \nColumbia, or between Columbia and its faculty.”).  His injuries, like those of other similarly \nsituated researchers, are clearly traceable to Defendants’ conduct via the stop work order and tied \nto the grant that bears his name.  \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs’ members are at least as connected to the grants and \nfunding at issue here as is Harvard and, by virtue of this relationship, their standing, more so than \nin the typical third-party standing case, hinges on a “predictable chain of events leading from the \ngovernment action to the asserted injury.”  All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 385.  It was \nentirely predictable that Defendants’ sudden revocation of funding would immediately and \ndirectly harm the Organizational Plaintiffs’ members, and, indeed, the summary judgment record \nreflects that it has.  See, e.g., [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 128, 136, 141, 143, 147–50, 156, 158, 164–65, \n168–70, 177–79, 188, 196].  And while Defendants would like to minimize this injury by \nclaiming that Harvard has unlimited funds to replace the withdrawn funds, the summary \njudgment record does not reflect that.  See, e.g., [AAUP, ECF No. 77-18 ¶¶ 27–28 (“I have no \nguarantee of funding from Harvard in writing, and any funding Harvard can provide will be far \nfrom sufficient to replace my federal grants or allow me to bring these projects to completion.  \nThe only long-term alternative to federal funding would be to find emergency philanthropic \nsupport, which is exceedingly unlikely.  If federal funding is not restored, project staff for the \nthird grant will soon have to explain to participants that projects are ending, and I will soon have \nto let the team in Peru go.”)]; [AAUP, ECF No. 77-23 ¶ 14 (“Harvard has also informed me that \n37 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 38 of 84\nthey will not be able to provide funding to supplement what we are losing in federal funds.”)]; cf. \nAAUP, 2025 WL 1684817, at *13 (“Plaintiffs’ own evidence also demonstrates that Columbia \nhas relied on ‘generous alumni’ to alleviate certain ‘unanticipated expenses.’”).   \nMoreover, even if the Court were to accept Defendants’ premise that Harvard could \ntheoretically bridge the gap for all $2.2 billion in terminated grants in perpetuity, the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have adequately established that their members will still experience \nconcrete harm by virtue of the grant terminations.  For instance, the Organizational Plaintiffs \npoint to the fact that “[w]ithout federal funding, [members] who are coming up for tenure may \nnot be competitive applicants for that crucial promotion,” explaining that “[f]ederal grants \nimpact tenure decisions beyond just the dollars themselves—tenure candidates must demonstrate \nthat they have served as principal investigators on federal research grants and are capable of \nperforming the sort of rigorous research that federal grant study sections (peer reviewers) \napprove for scarce federal dollars.”  [AAUP, ECF No. 77-19 ¶ 17]; see also [id. ¶ 22 \n(“[R]eceiving federal grants is not just about the funds themselves—it is a key indication that \nyour peers recognize the rigor and caliber of your work because federal grant applications are \nalways peer-reviewed.”)]; [AAUP, ECF No. 77-21 ¶ 22 (“[F]or faculty who are working towards \ntenure (as I am), the loss of federal funding for public health research restricts the ability to \ncreate the type of broad, high-impact program of research required for tenure.”)].  As such, the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs have successfully alleged that their members will suffer harm to their \nresearch as well as their careers by virtue of losing the opportunity to work with and receive \nfunding from the federal government.  “The loss of professional opportunities or income may \ncertainly constitute an injury in some cases,” Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Wheeler, 367 F. \nSupp. 3d 219, 232 (S.D.N.Y. 2019), and the loss of the opportunity to be a principal investigator \n38 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 39 of 84\non a federal, peer-reviewed grant is solely traceable to the grant funding terminations.  Cf. \nAAUP, 2025 WL 1684817, at *13 (finding no standing where plaintiffs had not “demonstrated \nthat it makes a difference to their members whether the funding for their research and salaries \ncomes from” the federal government or other funding sources).   \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs have also adequately established that they have experienced \nharm sufficient to maintain their First Amendment claim.  Defendants argue that “[i]t is well-\nsettled that ‘allegations of subjective chill are not an adequate substitute for a claim of specific \npresent objective harm or a threat of specific future harm.’”  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 16 \n(quoting Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 13–14 (1972))].  This ignores, however, a long line of \nSupreme Court case law recognizing standing in cases where “the challenged exercise of \ngovernmental power was regulatory, proscriptive, or compulsory in nature, and the complainant \nwas either presently or prospectively subject to the regulations, proscriptions, or compulsions \nthat he was challenging.”  Laird, 408 U.S. at 11 (1972); see also Speech First, Inc. v. Cartwright, \n32 F.4th 1110, 1120 (11th Cir. 2022) (“[T]o determine whether a First Amendment plaintiff has \nstanding, we simply ask whether the operation or enforcement, of the government policy would \ncause a reasonable would-be speaker to self-censor—even where the policy fall[s] short of a \ndirect prohibition against the exercise of First Amendment rights.” (citation modified)).  As \ndiscussed further infra, the record reflects that Defendants’ viewpoint-based demands have \nresulted in the Organizational Plaintiffs’ members being well beyond “subjectively chilled.”  \nRather, the Organizational Plaintiffs have established that their members have been and likely \nwill continue to be compelled to forgo certain research and discussion topics or at least parse \ntheir words carefully to maximize any chance of maintaining funding.  [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 137, \n210–17, 235–37, 247–48].   \n39 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 40 of 84\nDefendants argue in their reply brief that these First Amendment harms are not fairly \ntraceable to them because “Harvard exercised independent judgment in deciding which [of the \ngovernment’s] demands to accept.”  [AAUP, ECF No. 130 at 15].  Again, the Court is \nunconvinced.  As discussed infra, the April 11 Letter unambiguously links funding to the \ndemand that Harvard rebalance viewpoints on campus.  The professors’ and researchers’ fears \nthat adverse consequences may follow their decision not to abandon certain viewpoints are far \nfrom speculative.  Rather, they are directly “caused by the [Freeze Orders’ and Terminations \nLetters’] vagueness, the steep penalties [Defendants] have announced for [Harvard’s] \nnoncompliance with [their] requirements, and the measures [Defendants] ha[ve] already taken” \ndemonstrating they expect Harvard to comply.  Nat’l Educ. Ass’n v. Dep’t of Educ., 779 F. \nSupp. 3d 149, 181 (D.N.H. 2025). \nFinally, Defendants contend that, even if their members have experienced injury, the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs fail on the second and third Hunt prongs, arguing that they have “failed \nto establish that the interests that the suit seeks to vindicate are pertinent to the objectives for \nwhich the organization was formed,” [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 19], and that “the claims [the \nOrganizational] Plaintiffs have asserted require the participation of individual members,” [id. at \n20].  The Court disagrees.  The Organizational Plaintiffs have submitted evidence that the \nprimary mission of AAUP (and AAUP-Harvard) is “to advance academic freedom and shared \ngovernance in higher education, define fundamental professional values and standards for higher \neducation, promote the security of academic workers, and ensure higher education’s contribution \nto the common good.”  [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 96, 103]; see also [id. ¶ 96 (“Plaintiff AAUP ‘regularly \nconsults, works with, and represents local chapters and individual members regarding academic \nfreedom, faculty governance, and other issues involving the employment relationship between \n40 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 41 of 84\nAAUP members and their employers, including but not limited to collective bargaining.’” \n(citation omitted))].13  Pursuing litigation to end an alleged government intrusion on protected \nand well-established First Amendment rights in higher education, as well as to stop alleged \narbitrary funding cuts that could end careers, furthers those purposes.  Additionally, the \ninjunctive and declaratory relief the Organizational Plaintiffs request will not need to be tailored \nto each member individually as blanket relief will largely suffice and the relief sought will not \nrequire any individualized proof from any particular member.  See Camel Hair, 799 F.2d at 12 \n(“Actions for declaratory, injunctive and other forms of prospective relief have generally been \nheld particularly suited to group representation.”); see also Playboy Enters., 906 F.2d at 35 \n(“[J]ust because a claim may require proof specific to individual members of an association does \nnot mean the members are required to participate as parties in the lawsuit.” (emphasis omitted)).  \nAs such, the Court finds that the Hunt factors are satisfied, and the Organizational \nPlaintiffs have associational standing.  Because of this, the Court does not reach their arguments \nregarding direct standing. \nV.  FINAL AGENCY ACTION \nThe APA entitles any person “suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or \nadversely affected or aggrieved by agency action” to judicial review.  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Such \nreview, however, is limited to final agency actions unless otherwise specified by statute.  See id. \n§ 704.  \n \n \n13 Having found the germaneness requirement met for AAUP and AAUP-Harvard, the Court will \nnot consider whether it is also met for UAW, as “[a] proper case or controversy exists . . . when \nat least one plaintiff establishes . . . standing to sue.”  Murthy v. Missouri, 603 U.S. 43, 57 (2024) \n(citation modified).  \n41 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 42 of 84\nAn agency action is final if two conditions are met: first, the action must “mark the \nconsummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” and not be “of a merely tentative or \ninterlocutory nature,” and, second, it must be “one by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.”  Harper v. Werfel, 118 F.4th 100, 117 \n(1st Cir. 2024) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 \n(1997)).  “The core question is whether the agency has completed its decisionmaking process, \nand whether the result of that process is one that will directly affect the parties.”  Brnovich v. \nBiden, 630 F. Supp. 3d 1157, 1171 (D. Ariz. 2022) (quoting Or. Nat. Desert Ass’n v. U.S. Forest \nServ., 465 F.3d 977, 982 (9th Cir. 2006)). \nDefendants contend that “[t]o the extent that an APA challenge can be properly brought \nin this Court, only final agency action is reviewable under the APA, and the only final items are \nletters terminating specific contracts.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 39]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. \n104 at 29 (same)].  In particular, they argue that the April 11 Letter and May 5 Freeze Order do \nnot constitute final agency action and thus are not reviewable under the APA.  [Harvard, ECF \nNo. 186 at 40–42].  In their view, the April 11 Letter “was merely the starting bid in a \nnegotiation that Harvard has rejected, which is not agency action under the APA, let alone final \nagency action,” because “[t]he opening offer of a negotiation does not determine rights or \nobligations, nor does it have its own legal consequences.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 40]; see \nalso [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 31 (same)].  Defendants assert that the Court should view this \nwhole matter as a “contract dispute” and that “[f]undamental principles of contract law . . . \ndemonstrate” that the April 11 Letter did not have “binding legal effect” under the first Bennett \nprong.  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 41]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 31 (same)].  Regarding \nthe May 5 Freeze Order, Defendants appear to argue that it is not final agency action because it \n42 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 43 of 84\npurports to speak on behalf of the entire federal government, which the Secretary of Education \ncannot do.  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 42–43].14  \nHarvard counters that Defendants’ argument regarding the April 11 Letter misses the \nmark.15  It contends that “[e]ven assuming the April 11 Letter was not a final agency action the \nday the [g]overnment sent it, the [g]overnment certainly took final action three days later when it \n \n \n14 Defendants additionally argue that the May 5 Freeze Order is unreviewable because it is the \nsort of funding decision committed to agency discretion by law under 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  \n[Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 42].  The Court disagrees.  Even assuming that the decision to block \nHarvard from all future federal funding could be considered an “administrative decision \ntraditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion,” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 \n(1993), and the Court is not convinced that it is, Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C., Inc. v. HHS, 337 \nF. Supp. 3d 308, 324 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) (“While the Supreme Court has held that certain \nallocations of funds from lump-sum appropriations may be committed to agency discretion, this \nnarrow exception does not ‘typically’ or ‘presumptively’ extend to all allocations of appropriated \nfunds.”), the exception is typically limited to those “rare circumstances” where “no meaningful \nstandard” exists by which a reviewing judge could cabin that agency discretion, Dep’t of Com. v. \nNew York, 588 U.S. 752, 772 (2019).  Here, “applicable regulations cabin the [Education] \nDepartment’s discretion as to when it can terminate existing grants,” which “create meaningful \nstandards by which to judge the agency’s action.”  California, 132 F.4th at 97 (citation \nmodified); see Pol’y & Rsch., LLC v. HHS, 313 F. Supp. 3d 62, 75–78 (D.D.C. 2018) (K.B. \nJackson, J.) (holding that agency’s otherwise-presumptively unreviewable decision to halt \nfunding to an agency program was reviewable under the APA because applicable regulations \ncabined its termination authority).  \n15 The Court focuses on Harvard’s arguments regarding final agency action but notes that the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs urge the Court to also consider Defendants’ March 31 Letter, the April \n3 Letter, and the April 11 Letter as final agency actions.  [AAUP, ECF No. 110 at 26].  On this \nissue, the Court disagrees with the Organizational Plaintiffs. The March 31 Letter, in essence, \nannounced an investigation into higher education funding and noted that “any institution found \nto be in violation of federal compliance standards may face administrative actions, including \ncontract termination.”  [GSAHarv_00000002 (emphasis added)].  The First Circuit has been \nclear that “investigatory measures are not final agency action;” rather, the opening of a review or \ninvestigation is a preliminary step, “leading toward the possibility of a final action in the form of \nan enforcement or other action.”  Harper v. Werfel, 118 F.4th 100, 116 (1st Cir. 2024).  As to the \nApril 3 Letter, the April 11 Letter, by its terms, “incorporates and supersedes the terms of” the \nApril 3 Letter, [HHSHarv_00000098], such that the Court considers the April 3 Letter to be non-\nfinal.  The April 11 Letter itself poses a closer question.  Ultimately, however, in light of the \nCourt’s conclusion that the April 14 and May 5 Letters are final agency action, the Court need \nnot resolve this question.  \n \n43 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 44 of 84\nmade good on the threats and froze Harvard’s funding.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 211 at 33].  It \nfurther clarifies that “it is the culmination of the [g]overnment’s actions—punishing Harvard on \nApril 14 and thereafter for not acceding to unlawful demands made on April 3 and April 11—\nthat Harvard’s APA claim challenges.”  [Id.].  As to the May 5 Freeze Order, Harvard contends \nthat Defendants’ argument “is not a claim about finality at all” but rather a concession that the \nMay 5 Freeze Order was “not in accordance with law” and ultra vires.  [Id. at 34].  \nGiven that Defendants offer no response regarding the finality of the April 14 Freeze \nOrder or the May 5 Freeze Order at least as to the Department of Education, the Court will not \nspill too much ink on this issue.  It is satisfied that both freeze orders constituted final agency \naction such that they are reviewable under the APA.  On the first Bennet prong, the text of each \ndocument is clear.  The April 14 Freeze Order unambiguously states that “[t]he Joint Task Force \nto combat anti-Semitism is announcing a freeze on $2.2 billion in multi year grants and $60M in \nmulti-year contract value to Harvard University.”  [GSAHarv_00000012–13].  The May 5 Freeze \nOrder states that “today’s letter marks the end of new grants for the University,” that “this letter \nis to inform you that Harvard should no longer seek GRANTS from the federal government, \nsince none will be provided,” and that “Harvard will cease to be a publicly funded institution.”  \n[EDHarv_0000009].  This language is not “merely tentative or interlocutory” in nature,  Harper, \n118 F.4th at 116; rather, it is prescriptive and “mandatory,” Union of Concerned Scientists v. \nWheeler, 377 F. Supp. 3d 34, 42 (D. Mass. 2019), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, and remanded, 954 \nF.3d 11 (1st Cir. 2020), in that it unequivocally states that Defendants have made a decision and \nare moving forward with it.   \nAs to the second Bennett prong, again, the plain text of the April 14 and May 5 Letters \ncommunicates that consequences will be very shortly forthcoming.  Moreover, if these \n44 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 45 of 84\nannouncements left room for doubt as to whether Plaintiffs would experience any legal effect, \nDefendants’ conduct immediately following the announcements removed any such doubt, as the \nrecord reflects that Harvard immediately started to receive stop work orders following the \nissuance of the April 14 Freeze Order, [Harvard SOF ¶ 67], and a termination letter from the \nDepartment of Education arrived within the week, [EDHarvAR_0000011].  As such, this Court \nis satisfied that both freeze orders constitute reviewable final agency actions as they set policies \nthat brought forth near immediate legal consequences.  Brnovich, 630 F. Supp. 3d at 1171; \nWoonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. USDA, No. 25-cv-00097, 2025 WL 1116157, at \n*15 (D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025); see also New York v. Trump, 133 F.4th 51, 69 (1st Cir. 2025) \n(funding freeze constituted “final agency action[]”). \nAs such, the Court is satisfied that both Freeze Orders constitute final agency action such \nthat the Court can review them under the APA.16  \n \n \n16 Defendants also argue there is no “ripe dispute” between Harvard and DOJ because DOJ \n“grants . . . have not been frozen or terminated.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 63].  The Court \ndisagrees, as DOJ is a member of the Federal Task Force that was ultimately responsible for \nfreezing and terminating Harvard’s federal funding.  Various documents in the administrative \nrecord also reveal that at least one DOJ official was a central figure in the effort to terminate \nHarvard’s funding.  See, e.g., [NASA-AR03733 (May 8 email from NASA to DOJ official A. \nKambli (OASG))]; [NASA-AR03742 (May 8 email from A. Kambli to NASA)]; \n[GSAHarv_00000035 (May 8 email from GSA addressed to the White House and DOJ)].  As \nsuch, the Court is satisfied that, in enjoining DOJ, it is not “entangling [itself] in [an] abstract \ndispute disagreement[] over administrative policies;” rather, as part of the Federal Task Force \nresponsible for the Freeze Orders, DOJ’s “administrative decision has been formalized and its \neffects felt in a concrete way by [Harvard],” such that the dispute is ripe.  Nat’l Park Hosp. Ass’n \nv. Dep’t of Interior, 538 U.S. 803, 807–08 (2003) (citation omitted).   \n45 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 46 of 84\nVI.  DISCUSSION \nA.  First Amendment17 \nHarvard asserts that the Defendants’ actions in this case “violated Harvard’s First \nAmendment rights in at least two ways: 1) by retaliating against Harvard based on the exercise of \nits First Amendment rights, and 2) by imposing content- and viewpoint-based burdens on those \nrights through the imposition of funding conditions that are unrelated to any legitimate \ngovernment interest in combating antisemitic harassment or otherwise.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 70 \nat 34–35].  Because of this, Harvard contends that “[t]he Freeze Orders and Termination Letters \nshould be vacated and set aside, and any further similar action against Harvard should be \npermanently enjoined.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 70 at 35].  The Organizational Plaintiffs proceed \nunder the same two First Amendment theories, but also base their claim on an unconstitutional \ncoercion theory.18  [AAUP, ECF No. 75 at 51–58].  The parties have filed cross motions for \nsummary judgment on these claims.   [Harvard, ECF Nos. 69, 185; AAUP, ECF Nos. 74, 103].   \n \n \n17 This section addresses Plaintiffs’ respective First Amendment claims under the APA, which is \nCount 1 in Harvard’s action and Count IV in the Organizational Plaintiffs’ action.  Their \nequitable causes of action for violation of the First Amendment—Count 2 in the Harvard action \nand Count III in the Organization Plaintiffs’ action—are addressed in the Court’s analysis of the \nultra vires claims, infra.   \n18 At the summary-judgment hearing, the Organizational Plaintiffs conceded that a victory for \nHarvard on the retaliation and viewpoint discrimination claims would provide the Organizational \nPlaintiffs with the relief they seek, [Harvard, ECF No. 229 at 12:23–13:12], and their arguments \nmirror those advanced by Harvard in its motion.  Defendants also oppose the Organizational \nPlaintiffs’ claims for retaliation and viewpoint discrimination by reference to their briefs in the \nHarvard action.  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 35]; [AAUP, ECF No. 130 at 34–35].  As such, the \nCourt focuses its analysis for those claims on Harvard’s briefing as well.  The Organizational \nPlaintiffs also noted at the hearing, however, that they bring a claim for unconstitutional \ncoercion, [Harvard, ECF No. 229 at 10:19–11:11], which is a theory that Harvard does not \nadvance.  The Court addresses that argument infra with reference to the Organizational \nPlaintiffs’ briefing.  \n46 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 47 of 84\n1.  Retaliation \nAs a threshold issue, the parties disagree on the relevant standard to be used in assessing \nHarvard’s First Amendment retaliation claim, that is, its claim that Defendants retaliated against \nit based on the exercise of its First Amendment rights.  Harvard recites the typical framework \napplicable to private citizens.  [Harvard, ECF No. 70 at 35].  Defendants, on the other hand, \nassert that Harvard, as a recipient of federal grant funding, is a “government contractor” and, as \nsuch, its First Amendment rights “are circumscribed to the same extent as those of government \nemployees,” [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 43 (citing Bd. of Cnty. Comm’rs v. Umbehr, 518 U.S. \n668, 675 (1996))].  Specifically, Defendants contend that Harvard’s First Amendment rights “are \ngoverned by the balancing test announced in Pickering v. Board, which weighs the ‘interests of \nthe [contractor], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of \nthe State, as [a contracting entity], in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs \nthrough its [contractors].’”  [Id. (quoting Pickering v. Bd. of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 568 (1968))].   \nDefendants point the Court to no binding authority, however, to support the notion that a \nprivate research university becomes a government “contractor” for First Amendment purposes \nby accepting the government’s invitation to apply for and thus collaborate on federal research \ngrants.  In the absence of clear precedent, the Court will not adopt such a rule, particularly given \nthat the First Amendment right to and protection of academic freedom is squarely in play.  As \nHarvard notes, “the Supreme Court has applied Pickering only after it has ensured that the \naffected speech ‘does not raise questions of academic freedom that may or may not involve \n‘additional’ First Amendment ‘interests’ beyond those captured by [the Pickering] framework.’”  \n[Harvard, ECF No. 211 at 23 (quoting Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 528 \n(2022))].  Indeed, the Supreme Court, in a seminal government employee speech case, Garcetti \n47 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 48 of 84\nv. Ceballos, 547 U.S. 410 (2006), noted that “[t]here is some argument that expression related to \nacademic scholarship or classroom instruction implicates additional constitutional interests that \nare not fully accounted for by this Court’s customary employee-speech jurisprudence.”  Id. at \n425.  Given this, the Court declines to apply Umbehr here.19   \nAs such, to establish a prima facie case of First Amendment retaliation, Harvard must \nprove that 1) “[it] engaged in First Amendment-protected conduct,” 2) “[it] suffered an adverse \naction,” and 3) “[its] protected conduct played a ‘substantial or motivating’ part in the adverse \naction.”  Berge v. Sch. Comm. of Gloucester, 107 F.4th 33, 37 n.4 (1st Cir. 2024) (citation \nomitted).  Defendants “may then avoid a finding of liability by showing that ‘[they] would have \nreached the same decision . . . even in the absence of the protected conduct.’”  D.B. ex rel. \nElizabeth B. v. Esposito, 675 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir. 2012) (quoting Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d \n1, 17 (1st Cir. 2004)); see also McCue v. Bradstreet, 807 F.3d 334, 339, n.2 (1st Cir. 2015) \n(noting that “two-step framework” applied outside “the context of public employment, where it \noriginated”).  Defendants do not dispute that the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters \nconstitute an adverse action, see generally [Harvard, ECF No. 186]; [Harvard, ECF No. 223], \nand thus the Court focuses on the first and third prongs of the retaliation analysis.   \nOn the first prong, whether Harvard engaged in First Amendment protected activity, this \nCourt has previously written on Harvard’s relevant protected conduct in a separate action, \nPresident & Fellows of Harvard Coll. v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec. (“DHS”), No. 25-cv-\n \n \n19 That said, out of an abundance of caution, for the reasons articulated herein, the Court finds \nthat Harvard’s claim would survive under Umbehr.  Harvard has sufficiently demonstrated that it \nengaged in constitutionally protected conduct that was a substantial or motivating factor in the \ngrant terminations, and Defendants have failed to meet their burden to show that they would \nhave taken the same action even in the absence of the protected conduct, or that there are \nsufficiently strong legitimate countervailing government interests.  Umbehr, 518 U.S. at 675.   \n48 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 49 of 84\n11472, 2025 WL 1737493, at *15 (D. Mass. June 23, 2025), and thus endeavors or at least \naspires to be brief.  That said, it warrants repeating that Harvard engaged in constitutionally \nprotected conduct 1) when it refused the terms set forth in the April 11 Letter, which sought to \ncontrol viewpoints at Harvard, and 2) when it filed this lawsuit.  Defendants do not dispute that \nthe latter constitutes protected conduct.20  As to the April 11 Letter rejection, there is “a zone of \nFirst Amendment protection for the educational process itself,” Asociación de Educación Privada \nde P.R., Inc. v. Garcia-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2007) (citation omitted), that encompasses \nnot only “the independent and uninhibited exchange of ideas among teachers and students,” but \nalso Harvard’s “autonomous decisionmaking,” Regents of Univ. of Mich. v. Ewing, 474 U.S. \n214, 226 n.12 (1985).  The rights protected by the First Amendment include the right to “manage \nan academic community and evaluate teaching and scholarship free from [governmental] \ninterference,” Blasdel v. Nw. Univ., 687 F.3d 813, 816 (7th Cir. 2012) (citation omitted), as well \nas Harvard’s “prerogative ‘to determine for itself on academic grounds who may teach,’” \nLieberman v. Gant, 630 F.2d 60, 67 (2d Cir. 1980) (Friendly, J.) (emphasis added) (quoting \nSweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 263 (1957)), and what is taught in the “college \nclassroom,” Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180 (1972). \nDefendants’ April 11 Letter, on its face, was directed at these core freedoms, and \nHarvard’s April 14 rejection, on its face, was aimed at preserving them.  The April 11 Letter \n \n \n20 Contesting this would be difficult as the filing of a lawsuit is quintessential First Amendment \nprotected conduct.  The First Amendment protects the right “to petition the Government for a \nredress of grievances,” U.S. Const. amend. I, that is, “the right of individuals to appeal to courts \nand other forums established by the government for resolution of legal disputes,” Borough of \nDuryea v. Guarnieri, 564 U.S. 379, 387 (2011).  Put simply, “[f]iling and pursuing lawsuits are \nforms of protected petitioning,” Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP v. Exec. Off. of \nPresident, No. 25-917, 2025 WL 1502329, at *18 (D.D.C. May 27, 2025), that are “integral to \nthe democratic process,” Borough of Duryea, 564 U.S. at 388. \n49 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 50 of 84\nstated, in no uncertain terms, that the letter would constitute an “agreement in principle that \nw[ould] maintain Harvard’s financial relationship with the federal government” but only if \nHarvard agreed to “audit the student body, faculty, and leadership for viewpoint diversity,” \nreport that audit to the government, and “hir[e] a critical mass of new faculty” and “admit[] a \ncritical mass of students  . . . who will provide viewpoint diversity.”  [HHSHarv_00000098–\n100].  It further required Harvard to “abolish all criteria, preferences, and practices, whether \nmandatory or optional, throughout its admissions and hiring practices, that function as \nideological litmus tests;” to audit “programs and departments that . . . reflect ideological \ncapture;” to “immediately shuttter all diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, \ncommittees, positions, and initiatives . . . including DEI-based . . . speech control policies,” and \nto demonstrate that it had done so “to the satisfaction of the federal government.”  \n[HHSHarv_00000099–100].  In brief, the April 11 Letter purported to require Harvard to \noverhaul its governance, hiring, and academic programs to comport with the government’s \nideology and prescribed viewpoint.       \nAs to Harvard’s rejection, Defendants contend that it cannot constitute protected activity \nbecause the April 11 Letter was nothing more than an “offer” in an ongoing negotiation, and \n“rejection of an offer is not protected expression; it is a legal act extinguishing the original \noffer.”  [ECF No. 186 at 46].  They further contend that “[t]he consequences that followed \nflowed directly from the ‘noncommunicative impact’ of this legal act of rejection.”  [Id. (quoting \nStates v. O’Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 382 (1968)].  This Court has previously made clear that it views \nthe characterization of the April 11 Letter as an “offer” to be disingenuous, given that the letter \nwas not at all tentative as to what rejection would mean nor did it open the door to continued \ndiscussion.  DHS, 2025 WL 1737493, at *15.  That said, even accepting Defendants’ \n50 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 51 of 84\ncharacterization of the April 11 Letter as an “offer,” the Court disagrees that such a rejection \ncannot constitute protected conduct when, as here, the rejection was repeatedly and explicitly \nbased on Harvard’s refusal to surrender its First Amendment freedoms in the face of government \npressure.  Harvard’s rejection was clear, stating: \nIt is unfortunate . . . that your letter . . . presents demands that, in contravention of \nthe First Amendment, invade university freedoms long recognized by the Supreme \nCourt. . . . The university will not surrender its independence or relinquish its \nconstitutional rights. Neither Harvard nor any other private university can allow \nitself to be taken over by the federal government. Accordingly, Harvard will not \naccept the government’s terms as an agreement in principle. \n \n[HHSHarv_00000104–105].  In other words, Harvard’s rejection communicated that it would not \ntolerate the government’s attempt to control “who may teach, what may be taught, how it shall \nbe taught, and who may be admitted to study,” Regents of Univ. of California v. Bakke, 438 U.S. \n265, 312 (1978), and that unequivocal expression of core First Amendment values in the face of \ngovernment overreach constitutes protected speech.  \nDefendants further contend that, even if the April 11 Letter and the filing of this lawsuit \nconstitute protected conduct (which the Court has now found), Harvard has not shown that the \nprotected conduct was a substantial or motivating factor in the final agency action at issue.  This \nis difficult to square, however, with the text of the April 11 Letter, which explicitly conditioned \nfederal funding on Harvard’s acceding to the government’s demands, and the fact that the April \n14 Freeze Order came within hours of Harvard’s refusal to do so.  In fact, Defendants \nacknowledge in their opposition brief that the April 11 Letter “was clear that if an agreement was \nnot reached, [the government] would exercise its termination rights.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at \n48].  It is also difficult to square with the texts of the Freeze Orders and Termination letters, \nwhich blatantly link Harvard’s April 14 rejection of the government’s demands to the funding \ncuts.  The April 14 Freeze Order made this clear right from its start, opening with, “Harvard’s \n51 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 52 of 84\nstatement today reinforces the troubling entitlement mindset that is endemic in our nation’s most \nprestigious universities and colleges.”  [GSAHarv_ 00000012–13 (emphasis added)].  The May 5 \nFreeze Order similarly links its issuance to Harvard’s refusal to make “proposed common-sense \nreforms,” referencing substantially similar reforms as those outlined in the April 11 Letter, \n[EDHarvAR_0000009], and it makes no secret of the government’s ideological disagreements \nwith Harvard, calling attention to, among other things, Harvard’s decision to hire “failed Mayors \nBill [d]e Blasio and Lori Lightfoot, perhaps the worst mayors ever to preside over major cities in \nour country’s history,” and to allow “strongly left-leaning Obama political appointee Penny \nPritzker, a Democrat operative,” to manage the Harvard Corporation, [EDHarvAR_0000008–\n09].  And many of the Termination Letters reiterate that the impetus for the terminations was \nHarvard’s refusal to adopt “reforms” that the government deemed “appropriate.”  See, e.g., \n[HHSHarv_00000473–75 (“the University has refused to take appropriate action” (emphasis \nadded))]; [USDA-HARV-AR-00008–09 (same)]; [ENERGY AR3932 (“Harvard has refused to \ntake immediate, definitive and appropriate remedial action” (emphasis added))]. \nBased on this administrative record, the Court is satisfied that Harvard’s protected \nconduct was a substantial and motivating factor in the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters. \nDefendants contend, however, that Harvard’s retaliation claim nonetheless fails because “the \nagencies’ terminations are explained by a nonretaliatory purpose: opposing antisemitism,” \n[Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 45], such that the government “would have terminated” the grants \nirrespective of Harvard’s viewpoints, [id. at 43].  This argument does not carry the day. \nDefendants have failed to meet their burden to show they acted with a non-retaliatory purpose \nfor several reasons.  First, as discussed, the April 11 Letter specifically conditioned funding on \nagreeing to its ten terms, only one of which related to antisemitism, [HHSHarv_00000100 \n52 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 53 of 84\n(“Reforming Programs with Egregious Records of Antisemitism or Other Bias”)], while six \nrelated to ideological and pedagogical concerns, including who may lead and teach at Harvard, \n[HHSHarv_00000098–99 (“Governance and leadership reforms;” “Merit-Based Hiring \nReform”)], who may be admitted, [HHSHarv_00000099 (“Merit-Based Admissions Reform;” \n“International Admissions Reform”)], and what may be taught, [HHSHarv_00000099–100 \n(“Viewpoint Diversity in Admissions and Hiring;” “Discontinuation of DEI”)].  Additionally, \nDefendants’ argument ignores that Harvard’s April 14 letter rejected only the conditions it \nviewed as infringing on its First Amendment rights and, in fact, specifically agreed to discuss \nmeasures aimed at combatting antisemitism, [HHSHarv_00000104–105 (“Harvard remains open \nto dialogue about what the university has done, and is planning to do” to combat antisemitism)], \nan offer Defendants similarly disregarded when instituting the first funding freeze on the basis of \n“Harvard’s statement[s]” hours later.  [GSAHarv_00000012].   \nMoreover, although combatting antisemitism is indisputably an important and worthy \nobjective, nothing else in the administrative record supports Defendants’ contention that they \nwere primarily or even substantially motivated by that goal (or that cutting funding to Harvard \nbore any relationship to achieving that aim).  As discussed further infra, before the April 14 \nFreeze Order, Defendants had announced a funding review consistent with the goals of \ncombatting antisemitism; the record, however, does not reflect that Defendants engaged in such a \nreview, weighed the value of any grant, gathered any data regarding antisemitism at Harvard, or \nconsidered if and how terminating certain grants would improve the situation for Jewish students \nat Harvard.  Rather, all that Defendants learned between March 31 and April 14, 2025 was that \nHarvard would not capitulate to government demands that it audit, censor, or dictate viewpoints \nof staff and students.  The fact that Defendants’ swift and sudden decision to terminate funding, \n53 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 54 of 84\nostensibly motivated by antisemitism, was made before they learned anything about antisemitism \non campus or what was being done in response, leads the Court to conclude that the sudden focus \non antisemitism was, at best (and as discussed infra), arbitrary and, at worst, pretextual.  \nThus, the Court is satisfied that Harvard is entitled to summary judgment on its claim for \nFirst Amendment retaliation on the face of the administrative record.  The Court would be \nremiss, however, if it did not note that the summary judgment record also contains numerous \nexhibits and undisputed facts that go beyond the administrative record that speak to Defendants’ \nretaliatory motive in terminating Harvard’s funding.21  Although Defendants now contend that \nHarvard’s April 14 rejection and subsequent lawsuit had nothing to do with their decision to cut \nits funding, numerous government officials spoke publicly and contemporaneously on these \nissues, including about their motivations, and those statements are flatly inconsistent with what \nDefendants now contend.  These public statements corroborate that the government-initiated \n \n \n21 It is not entirely clear whether the Court can consider undisputed facts in the summary \njudgment record that go beyond the administrative record in deciding Plaintiffs’ First \nAmendment claim brought under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  See, e.g., Chiayu Chang v. U.S. \nCitizenship & Immigr. Servs., 254 F. Supp. 3d 160, 161 (D.D.C. 2017) (“As to plaintiffs’ \nconstitutional claims, there appears to be some disagreement among district courts whether the \nassertion of constitutional claims takes a case outside the procedural strictures of the APA, \nincluding the record review rule.”).  Here, however, Defendants agreed at the hearing that such \nundisputed facts could be considered by the Court, [ECF No. 229 at 9:7–23], nor have they \nobjected in subsequent motion practice.  See Bos. Redevelopment Auth., 838 F.3d at 48 \n(considering supplemental information where “the parties—by mutual consent—conducted \nadditional discovery” and “cite[d] to and rel[ied] on this supplemental information throughout \ntheir . . . briefs”).  Thus, while the Court is satisfied that the administrative record alone fully \nsupports its decision, it includes some of the additional undisputed information here.  \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs have brought equitable claims for First Amendment violations, which the \nCourt does not reach because it finds that they are entitled to relief under the APA.  That said, it \nis the Court’s understanding that these additional facts would be available and relevant to the \nCourt’s analysis in equity if Plaintiffs’ APA claims were not successful.  \n54 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 55 of 84\nonslaught against Harvard was much more about promoting a governmental orthodoxy in \nviolation of the First Amendment than about anything else, including fighting antisemitism.   \n  For instance, in the forty-eight hours following the April 14 Freeze Order, the President \ntook to social media multiple times to talk about Harvard.  He posted on Truth Social that \nHarvard is “a JOKE” that “should no longer receive Federal Funds.”  [AAUP SOF ¶ 90]; [ECF \nNo. 77-9].  His stated concerns (which would later be echoed in the May 5 Freeze Order) were \nuntethered from antisemitism and instead based entirely on Harvard’s “hiring almost all woke, \nRadical Left, idiots and ‘birdbrains’ who are only capable of teaching FAILURE to students,” \nincluding “two of the WORST and MOST INCOMPETENT mayors in the history of our \nCountry,” referring to Democratic mayors Bill de Blasio and Lori Lightfoot.  [AAUP SOF ¶ 90]; \n[ECF No. 77-9].  This post echoed his comments from a day earlier, when he opined, again on \nTruth Social, that “[p]erhaps Harvard should lose its Tax Exempt status and be Taxed as a \nPolitical Entity.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 49].  Again, that post did not reference antisemitism explicitly \nbut rather was focused on Harvard’s “pushing political, ideological, and terrorist \ninspired/supporting ‘Sickness[.]’”  [Id.].  It was not until nearly ten days later that the President \nwould call Harvard “Anti-Semitic,” doing so in a Truth Social post that, in the same breath, \ncalled Harvard a “Far Left Institution” and a “Liberal mess, allowing a certain group of crazed \nlunatics to enter and exit the classroom and spew fake ANGER AND HATE.”  [AAUP SOF \n¶ 91]; [ECF No. 77-10].22 \n \n \n22 On May 7, 2025, Linda McMahon made a statement in which she denied that the funding cuts \nwere “about [the] First Amendment” and were in fact “about civil rights.”  [AAUP SOF ¶ 93].  \nIn that same statement, however, she noted that, in addition to civil rights concerns, the \ngovernment “also wanted to make sure some of the other things that [the government] talked [to \nHarvard] about” were resolved, including whether Harvard was “vetting students who are \n \n55 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 56 of 84\nA similar barrage followed Harvard’s decision to litigate rather than settle this case, with \nAdministration officials being clear about the connection between that decision and the funding \ncuts.  In particular, on May 28, 2025, the Secretary of Education summarized the situation with \nHarvard, stating:  \nWhen we looked at different aspects of what Harvard was doing relative to anti-\nSemitism on its campuses they were not enforcing Title VI the way it should be.  \nAnd we had conversations with President Garber and I expected that we would have \nmore, but Harvard’s answer was a lawsuit so that’s where we find ourselves. . . . I \nthink the President is looking at this as, OK, how, how can we really make our \npoint[?]   \n \n[AAUP SOF ¶ 95 (emphasis added)].  The same day, during an interview in the Oval Office, the \nPresident himself said that Harvard is “hurting [itself]” by “fighting,” contrasting Harvard with \nColumbia, who he noted “has been . . . very, very bad . . . . But they’re working with us on \nfinding a solution.”  [Harvard SOF ¶ 95].  He declared that Harvard “wants to fight. They want \nto show how smart they are, and they’re getting their ass kicked.”  [Id.].  His conclusion: \n“[E]very time [Harvard] fight[s], they lose another $250 million.”  [Id.].  \nIn brief, Defendants’ contention that Harvard’s First Amendment activities were not a \n“substantial and motivating” factor in the funding terminations, or that those terminations were \nanimated by non-retaliatory motives, does not square with the government’s communications \nregarding its decision, which specifically and repeatedly linked the coordinated funding cuts to \nHarvard’s decision to “fight.”  That “fight” (Harvard’s decision to speak out and litigate its case \nin the courts and the marketplace of ideas), however, is indisputably protected by the First \n \n \ncoming in from outside of the country to make sure they’re not activists” and “vetting professors \nthat [it is] hiring to make sure that they’re not teaching ideologies.”  [Id.]. In other words, she \nagain tied the government’s actions to viewpoint-related conditions similar to those within the \nApril 11 Letter.  \n56 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 57 of 84\nAmendment.  Borough of Duryea, 564 U.S. at 387.  To the extent the Court can consider these \npublic statements, they provide additional support for granting Plaintiffs’ summary judgment \nmotion as to their First Amendment claims; to the extent it cannot, however, the administrative \nrecord, standing alone, is more than sufficient to demonstrate that Defendants impermissibly \nretaliated against Harvard for refusing to capitulate to the government’s demands.  Plaintiffs are \nthus entitled to summary judgment on their First Amendment retaliation claims.  \n2.  Unconstitutional Conditions  \nGiven that Harvard is entitled to summary judgment on its retaliation-based First \nAmendment claim, the Court need not reach Harvard’s unconstitutional conditions-based theory, \nthat is, its claim that Defendants impermissibly imposed on Harvard content- and viewpoint-\nbased funding conditions that were unrelated to any legitimate government interest.  [Harvard, \nECF No. 70 at 40–42].  That said, having found that the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters \nresulted from Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights, it is evident that Defendants \nimpermissibly imposed unconstitutional conditions on Harvard’s receipt of federal funds.23  \nPerry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (“[T]his Court has made clear that even though a \nperson has no ‘right’ to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may \ndeny him the benefit for any number of reasons . . . [i]t may not deny a benefit to a person on a \n \n \n23 It is, in fact, unclear to this Court that these two claims are distinct from one another.  Best \nPayphones, Inc. v. Dobrin, 410 F. Supp. 3d 457, 511 (E.D.N.Y. 2019) (“At the outset, this Court \nnotes that it is entirely unclear how a claim alleging a First Amendment unconstitutional \ncondition differs from First Amendment retaliation. Indeed, many opinions suggest that they are \none and the same.”).  Out of an abundance of caution, however, the Court addresses Harvard’s \nunconstitutional conditions theory separately.  \n \n \n \n57 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 58 of 84\nbasis that infringes . . . his interest in freedom of speech.”); see also Agency for Int’l Dev. v. All. \nFor Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc., 570 U.S. 205, 214 (2013) (“[A] funding condition can result in an \nunconstitutional burden on First Amendment rights.”).  Moreover, it is worth noting that the \nconditions here are particularly concerning because, as discussed, many of them were based on \nHarvard’s “particular beliefs,” Nat’l Rifle Ass’n of Am. v. Vullo, 602 U.S. 175, 188 (2024), and \nsought to dictate the content of speech on campus and the “particular views taken by speakers on \n[particular] subject[s],” Rosenberger v. Rectors & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 829 \n(1995).  “On the spectrum of dangers to free expression, there are few greater than allowing the \ngovernment to change the speech of private actors in order to achieve its own conception of \nspeech nirvana.”  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 603 U.S. 707, 719, 741–42 (2024).   \nDefendants in opposition offer only that “[i]t is an open question whether the \nunconstitutional conditions doctrine can even be properly applied to settlement negotiations at \nall.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 49].  Defendants’ cited authority, however, notes that the “mere \nfact that one agrees to the challenged condition, even in a settlement, cannot by itself render the \nbargain constitutional because the unconstitutional conditions doctrine focuses on the propriety \nof the condition, not the fact that the claimant agreed to it.”  Stephens v. Cnty. of Albemarle, No. \n04-cv-00081, 2005 WL 3533428, at *6 (W.D. Va. Dec. 22, 2005); see also Koontz v. St. Johns \nRiver Water Mgmt. Dist., 570 U.S. 595, 608 (2013) (holding that a constitutional claim may rest \non “an unconstitutionally extortionate demand”).  Here, Defendants’ focus on whether the April \n11 Letter was a final agency action or whether it was a simple settlement term is misplaced; \nrather, the issue is the impropriety of conditioning Harvard’s federal funding, even as part of \nsettlement negotiations, on Harvard’s realigning its campus to better reflect a viewpoint favored \n58 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 59 of 84\nby the government.  As such, the Court finds that Defendants imposed unconstitutional \nconditions on Harvard’s receipt of federal funding in violation of the First Amendment.  \n3.  Unconstitutional Coercion  \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs also assert a First Amendment claim based on a theory of \nunconstitutional coercion, relying primarily on National Rifle Association of America v. Vullo, \nwhich held that “[a] government official cannot directly or indirectly coerce a private party to \npunish or suppress disfavored speech on her behalf.”  602 U.S. at 190; see also id. at 189 (“The \nFirst Amendment prohibits government officials from relying on the ‘threat of invoking legal \nsanctions and other means of coercion . . . to achieve the suppression’ of disfavored speech.” \n(quoting Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 67 (1963))).  Defendants contend that \nVullo is distinguishable because, “unlike Vullo, [this case] does not involve the government \nthreatening coercive action against one party to get at the protected speech of a third; instead, the \ngovernment is using its enforcement authority to act directly upon a regulated entity because of \nthat entity’s own conduct.”  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 33].  They further assert that “[u]nlike in \nVullo, there are no plausible allegations here that any of the actions taken by the agencies were \ndone ‘in order to’ suppress or punish protected speech, rather than to pursue a legitimate \ninterest,” namely combatting antisemitism.  [Id. at 34].   \nThe Court disagrees.  Vullo is instructive on this issue, if not determinative.  In that case, \nthe Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (“DFS”), Maria Vullo, in \nthe wake of a high-profile school shooting allegedly criticized the National Rifle Association \n(“NRA”), urging insurance companies and other financial institutions regulated by DFS to \ndiscontinue any arrangements they had with the NRA or face investigation for technical \nregulatory infractions.  602 U.S. at 182–84.  DFS subsequently entered into consent decrees with \n59 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 60 of 84\ntwo insurers, who agreed not to any provide NRA-endorsed insurance programs and then cut ties \nwith the NRA.  Id. at 185.  The Court held that the government cannot threaten or impose legal \nsanctions or use other means of coercion to suppress speech.  Id. at 180.  Although “Vullo was \nfree to criticize the NRA and pursue the conceded violations of New York insurance law,” id. at \n187, as a government official, she could not “attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish \nor suppress views that the government disfavors,” id. at 180. \nDefendants’ contention that this case “is different in kind” than Vullo, [AAUP, ECF No. \n104 at 33], is unavailing.  As discussed at length, the administrative record reflects that, via the \nApril 11 Letter, Defendants unconstitutionally sought to force Harvard to better manifest the \ngovernment’s favored worldview.  To do so, Defendants (like Maria Vullo) urged and threatened \nHarvard (in the position of the insurer) to hire faculty and make curricula and research choices \nthat better aligned with the government’s preferred viewpoints, to the detriment of professors and \nresearchers with competing views (like the NRA).  Pursuant to Vullo, using this type of coercion \nto suppress speech, third-party or otherwise, is not permissible.  602 U.S. at 180–81.  Because \nthe Defendants required the Organizational Plaintiffs’ members to rebalance and alter their \nspeech to save Harvard’s funding, the Court finds the Organizational Plaintiffs are entitled to \nsummary judgment on their unconstitutional coercion claim. \n  Based on the foregoing, the Court GRANTS summary judgment to Plaintiffs on their \nFirst Amendment claims for retaliation, unconstitutional conditions, and unconstitutional \ncoercion, and it DENIES Defendants’ competing motions.  \nB.  Title VI \nPlaintiffs and Defendants have filed cross motions for summary judgment on Plaintiffs’ \nTitle VI claims.  Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination on the basis of \n60 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 61 of 84\nrace, color, or national origin in “any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”  \n42 U.S.C. § 2000d.24  In Title VI, Congress identified specific procedures that an agency must \nfollow before “terminating, or refusing to grant or continue, assistance” based on an alleged \nfailure to comply with a requirement adopted pursuant to Title VI.  Id. at § 2000d-1.  \nSpecifically, Title VI provides that no action terminating financial assistance “shall be taken until \nthe department or agency concerned has” 1) “advised the appropriate person or persons of the \nfailure to comply with the requirement,” and 2) “determined that compliance cannot be secured \nby voluntary means.”  Id.  If the relevant department or agency determines that voluntary \ncompliance is not possible, it may then terminate grants, but only if “there has been an express \nfinding on the record, after opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with such \nrequirement,” and the termination must be “limited to the particular . . . recipient as to whom \nsuch a finding has been made,” as well as “the particular program, or part thereof, in which such \nnoncompliance has been so found.”  Id.  Further, once these procedural steps have been met, “the \nhead of the Federal department or agency shall file with the committees of the House and Senate \nhaving legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved a full written report of the \ncircumstances and the grounds for such action.”  Id.  After this report is filed with Congress, the \naction still may not “become effective until thirty days have elapsed.”  Id.  Only then may an \nagency terminate funding because of concerns about discrimination.  \n  It is undisputed that Defendants did not comply with these requirements before issuing \nthe Freeze Orders or Termination Letters.  The administrative record contains no evidence of a \n \n \n24 The parties do not dispute that Title VI protects Jewish students from harassment.  \n“[D]iscrimination based on actual or perceived Israeli identity is of course discrimination based \non national origin.”  Kestenbaum v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 743 F. Supp. 3d 297, \n307 (D. Mass. 2024).  \n61 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 62 of 84\nnotice of noncompliance, an assessment that compliance could not be achieved by voluntary \nmeans, a hearing, a finding on the record, or a report to Congress.  See generally [Harvard, ECF \nNo. 224]; see also [Harvard SOF ¶¶ 96, 98–101].  Thus, to the extent Defendants were required \nto comply with Title VI, Plaintiffs are indisputably entitled to summary judgment on their Title \nVI claims.  See, e.g., City of Providence v. Barr, 954 F.3d 23, 31 (1st Cir. 2020) (“Any action \nthat an agency takes outside the bounds of its statutory authority is ultra vires . . . and violates the \nAdministrative Procedure Act.” (citation omitted)). \n  Defendants contend, however, that they, rather than Plaintiffs, are entitled to summary \njudgment on the Title VI claims because they were not required to comply with Title VI at all.  \nSee [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 51].  Rather, they argue that they terminated Harvard’s funding \npursuant to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), which provides that a “Federal award may be terminated in \npart or its entirety. . . . [b]y the Federal agency . . . pursuant to the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award, including, to the extent authorized by law, if an award no longer effectuates the \nprogram goals or agency priorities.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 52–55].  Notably, however, \nneither the April 14 nor the May 5 Freeze Order contains any reference to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, \nand it is a fundamental principle of administrative law that “the post hoc rationalizations of the \nagency . . . cannot serve as a sufficient predicate for agency action.”  Am. Textile Mfrs. Inst., \nInc. v. Donovan, 452 U.S. 490, 539 (1981).   \nThis lack of reference to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340 in the Freeze Orders does not reflect an \nisolated or accidental oversight; in fact, this Court’s diligent review of the administrative record \nhas not identified a single document predating the Termination Letters that references 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340 as a basis for ending Harvard’s funding.  Rather, the record is replete with documents \ncalling on Harvard’s funding to be investigated and terminated pursuant to Title VI (not 2 C.F.R. \n62 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 63 of 84\n§ 200.340) or, more generally, “civil rights laws” (like Title VI).  This includes a December 2024 \nCongressional Staff Report on Antisemitism, [HHSHarv_00000030 (“The Executive Branch \nShould Aggressively Enforce Title VI”)]; Executive Order 14188, [HHSHarv_00000001 (calling \non the Attorney General to “employ appropriate civil rights enforcement,” referencing Title VI \ncomplaints, and incorporating prior executive order discussing Title VI at length)]; see also \nExec. Order No. 14188, 90 Fed. Reg. 8857 (Jan. 29, 2025); the April 3 Letter (which, as \ndiscussed, was incorporated into the April 11 Letter), [GSAHarv_00000005 (claiming Harvard \n“has fundamentally failed to protect American students and faculty from antisemitic violence and \nharassment in addition to other alleged violations of Title VI”)]; the April 11 Letter, \n[GSAHarv_00000007 (federal investment “depends on Harvard upholding federal civil rights \nlaws”)]; and, the April 14 Freeze Order, [GSAHarv_00000013 (noting that federal investment \ncomes with “the responsibility to uphold civil rights laws”)].  To conclude that 2 C.F.R. \n§ 200.340(a)(4) served as the basis for these terminations, rather than Title VI, is simply \n“incongruent with what the record reveals about the agenc[ies’] priorities and decisionmaking \nprocess.”  Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). \n  Defendants maintain that the Termination Letters are the relevant final agency action, and \nthat those letters do cite to 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) as the basis for the terminations.  [Harvard, \nECF No. 223 at 8 n.1].  Even accepting the premise that invoking 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) at the \nlast moment was not a post hoc attempt to remedy the failure to follow Title VI’s procedures, the \nargument that this regulation authorizes Defendants’ conduct is, at best, circular.  The regulation \npermits an agency to terminate federal grants for no longer effectuating “agency priorities,” and \nto do so “to the extent authorized by law.”  2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4).  The agency priority \nidentified in the Termination Letters is, almost uniformly, Harvard’s purported failure to combat \n63 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 64 of 84\nantisemitism.  [Harvard SOF ¶ 78]; see also [AAUP SOF ¶¶ 43–44, 50–51, 57, 63, 69, 72, 74, \n76, 83–84].  Congress has, however, passed a law that explicitly provides for when and how an \nagency can terminate federal funding to address this type of discrimination—and that law is Title \nVI, which dictates that “no such action shall be taken until the department or agency” has gone \nthrough the appropriate procedures.  42 U.S.C. § 2000d-1.  In other words, allowing Defendants \nto use 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4) to cancel grants based on discrimination is not authorized by law, \nas it would result in the regulation wholly nullifying an explicit statutory scheme, which is \nimpermissible.  P. Gioioso & Sons, Inc. v. Occupational Safety & Health Rev. Comm’n, 115 \nF.3d 100, 105 (1st Cir. 1997) (“[R]egulations cannot alter th[e] statutory scheme.”).  \nDefendants disagree with the Court’s reading of the interplay between Title VI and 2 \nC.F.R. § 200.340(a)(4), contending that it “would require concluding that Congress intended \ndiscriminators to have more protections than those whose contract[s] are terminated for different \npolicy reasons under 2 C.F.R. § 200.340, which would conflict with Congress’s intent of \nachieving maximal civil rights protections.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 54].  It is Congress’s \nrole, however, to circumscribe agency authority as it sees fit, and here it has, passing a statute \naimed at “avoid[ing] a punitive . . . application of the termination power” by imposing \n“procedural limitations . . . designed to [e]nsure” that end.  Bd. of Pub. Instruction v. Finch, 414 \nF.2d 1068, 1075 (5th Cir. 1969).  “Discriminators” are not afforded more protections; rather, \npeople and entities receiving federal funding are shielded against being labeled with the \n“irreversible stigma” of “discriminator” until a certain level of agency process has determined \nthat there was misconduct that warranted termination.  Bowman v. EPA, 712 F. Supp. 375, 383 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1989); see also Foster v. Mydas Assocs., Inc., 779 F. Supp. 614, 620 (D. Mass. 1991) \n(“To charge racial discrimination is to accuse a person of a most despicable and disreputable act. \n64 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 65 of 84\nThus, one who seeks to secure his own civil rights must, in turn, be equally sensitive to the rights \nof the innocent to preserve their good name and not, without sufficient legal basis, rob them of \nthat which not enriches him but makes them poor indeed.” (citation modified)).  This Court’s \nrole is not to second guess Congress’s judgment, and it may not disregard an explicit statutory \nscheme aimed at exactly the harm at issue, namely addressing discriminatory conduct.25  \nAs such, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment as to their Title \nVI claims and DENIES Defendants’ motions.  \nC.  Arbitrary and Capricious \nPlaintiffs further contend that Defendants’ actions violate the APA because they were \narbitrary and capricious.  Plaintiffs raise three main arguments: 1) Defendants failed to provide a \nreasoned explanation as to why it was necessary to freeze funding to Harvard; 2) Defendants \nfailed to consider the consequences of freezing funding to Harvard, namely, “whether any \nputative benefits from terminating Harvard’s funding could outweigh the costs of terminating \ncritical research programs;” and, 3) Defendants failed to consider serious reliance interests \nbefore freezing funding to Harvard.  [Harvard, ECF No. 70 at 50–58]; see also [AAUP, ECF No. \n75 at 35–51 (similar)].  Defendants’ counterargument is similarly three-fold.  They contend that \n1) deciding to freeze grants was not arbitrary and capricious because they followed a \n \n \n25 Count 3 of Harvard’s Amended Complaint cites 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (C), while Count 4 \ncites 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) and (D).  [Harvard, ECF No. 59 at ¶¶ 140–92].  Because the \nDefendant agencies failed to follow the procedures prescribed in Title VI, their actions were “not \nin accordance with law,” “in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” and \n“without observance of procedure required by law,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (C), (D); see also \nCampanale & Sons, Inc. v. Evans, 311 F.3d 109, 117–21, 121 n.15 (1st Cir. 2002) (holding that \nagency’s failure to follow explicit statutory procedural requirement in enacting regulations \nwould violate 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(D)), and thus Harvard’s motion is granted as to both counts. \n \n65 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 66 of 84\n“comprehensive review of Federal contracts with certain institutions of higher education that \n[were] being investigated for potential infractions and dereliction of duties to curb or combat \nanti-Semitic harassment,” including Harvard, citing to the Federal Task Force’s March 31 Letter \ninforming Harvard of the funding review; 2) Defendants weighed the cost of cutting research; \nand 3) Harvard cannot have a serious reliance interest in grant programs that are discretionary \nunder 2 C.F.R. § 200.340.  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 56–60]; [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 41–46].  \n“An agency action qualifies as ‘arbitrary’ or ‘capricious’ if it is not ‘reasonable and \nreasonably explained.’”  Ohio v.

(quoting FCC \nv.

U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 102 F.3d 1273, 1285 (1st Cir. 1996)).   \nStarting with the choice made, the Freeze Orders base the decision to end funding on the \nDefendant agencies having set a new priority, that is, to combat antisemitism, and their \n66 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 67 of 84\ndetermination that Harvard had not taken sufficient steps to address antisemitism.  Combatting \nantisemitism is, without question, a laudable and important goal.  Even an indisputably worthy \ngoal, however, does not allow Defendants to change course on decades of federal funding for \ncritical research without providing a reasoned explanation as to how the agency determined that \nfreezing funding would advance that goal, or, in other words, help combat antisemitism.  Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 221 (2016) (“Agencies are free to change their \nexisting policies as long as they provide a reasoned explanation for the change.”).  On that front, \nthe Freeze Orders come up short for several reasons.  \nFirst, the Court is cognizant that, as Defendants contend, it “must ‘uphold a decision of \nless than ideal clarity if the agency’s path may be reasonably discerned,’” [Harvard, ECF No. \n186 at 57 (quoting Bowman Transp., Inc. v. Ark.-Best Freight Sys., Inc., 419 U.S. 281, 286 \n(1974))], and that weighing the costs and benefits of terminating funding is “vested in the \nagencies, even if the plaintiff (or the court) would have weighed those interests differently,” [id. \nat 59].  Here, however, the administrative record does not support that such a “path” was charted \nor that such weighing occurred.  Although it is true that the Federal Task Force announced on \nMarch 31, 2025 that it would be embarking on a comprehensive review of federal contracts at \nHarvard to combat antisemitism, [GSAHarv_00000002], the record does not reflect that such a \nreview occurred between that March 31 Letter and the Freeze Orders.  Defendants have not \npointed to a single document, nor has the Court’s review of the record located one, that indicates \nthat they weighed the value of the research funded by a particular grant against the goal of \ncombating antisemitism at Harvard.  Several documents, in fact, indicate that such a weighing \nlikely did not occur before the assault on Harvard began or even by the time of the eventual \nTermination Letters (although, to be clear, the Court is not purporting to rule on the Termination \n67 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 68 of 84\nLetters as part of its arbitrary and capricious analysis).  For instance, DoD did not inform its \nofficials that the Secretary of Defense had directed the cancellation of grants until the day after \nsending their termination letter, [DoDHarv_00000039–46, DoDHarv_00000033], leading, as \ndiscussed supra, the director of DARPA to plead with her supervisors to save a grant with \nHarvard aimed at preparing the country for emerging biological threats.  [DoDHarv_00000047 \n(“Development of critical technologies that enables bio surveillance and biocollection in austere, \nfield forward locations bolsters national security and warfighter safety and lethality.”)].  \nPresumably, had any grant-based weighing occurred in advance, these concerns would have been \nraised, and, in any case, the record contains no information that this grant or any other DoD grant \nwas discussed at all before being terminated.26   \nSecond, the record reflects that Defendants had essentially no information about the \nprevalence of antisemitism at Harvard before issuing the Freeze Orders.  DHS v. Regents of the \nUniv. of Cal., 951 U.S. 1, 30 (2020) (holding agency action was arbitrary and capricious where \nagency “entirely fail[ed] to consider [an] important aspect[] of the problem” that was “the \ncenterpiece of the policy” (citation omitted)).  The administrative record contains two documents \nwhich discuss antisemitism at Harvard: 1) the December 2024 Congressional Staff Report on \nAntisemitism, [HHSHarv _00000013–55], and 2) the April 29, 2025 Harvard Task Force \nReport.27  As to the former, there is no indication in the record that the agencies considered the \n \n \n26 While not part of the administrative record, it is again worth noting that, per post-motion \nfilings, this grant appears to have continued, despite nominally being cancelled.  [ECF No. 221].  \n27 Although neither party points to it in briefing, the Court’s review of the record reveals one \nother document outlining methods of “[a]ddressing [a]ntisemitism and [a]nti-Americanism” at \nHarvard, produced bearing an HHS bates stamp.  [HHSHarv_00000083–97].  The Court cannot \ndiscern on the face of the document, however, which agency, if any, created it or considered it.  \nIn any event, of the many methods it proposes to address antisemitism and anti-Americanism, \nnone of those methods involve terminating federal grants.  [Id.].  \n68 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 69 of 84\nCongressional Staff Report in deciding to freeze funding.  The Freeze Orders make no mention \nof it, and even the Termination Letters almost uniformly cite to the Harvard Task Force Report \nas support, rather than anything that came before Harvard’s own report.  See, e.g., [USDA-\nHARV-AR-00008 (basing finding that Harvard failed to combat antisemitism on the conclusions \nof the “the Harvard Presidential Task Force on combating Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias”)]; \n[DoDHarv _ 00000039 (same)]; [EDHarvAR_0000011 (same)]; [ENERGY AR3932 (same)].  \nAnd that Harvard Task Force Report cannot serve as the justification for the April 14 Freeze \nOrder because it was released on April 29, 2024, two weeks after the Freeze Order.  As discussed \nsupra, the agencies at issue here simply cannot rely on a post hoc rationalization for having \nfrozen funding, and a report that postdated an action would certainly qualify as post hoc.28 \nThird, even accepting the premise that Defendants relied on the Congressional Staff \nReport and the Harvard Task Force Report to identify antisemitism as a problem, the \nadministrative record contains no evidence that Defendants considered any of the steps Harvard \nhad taken to research or address antisemitism on campus before declaring that funding would be \nfrozen because Harvard had failed to address the issue.29  The record reflects that Harvard was, \nin fact, working to respond to and ameliorate antisemitism, that it continued to do so each time \nthe government raised concerns, and that it remained (and seemingly remains) open to dialogue \nas to what more it could do in the government’s eyes to combat the problem.  For instance, after \n \n \n28 Moreover, timing aside, allowing Defendants to rely solely on the Harvard Task Force Report \nwould have raised other concerns, including the disincentive it could create for universities to \nassess and remedy their own shortcomings regarding issues like antisemitism. \n29 There is one document in the administrative record which appears to have been circulated by \ncounsel for HHS entitled “Already Done by Harvard,” which does describe some steps Harvard \nhad taken to address antisemitism.  [HHSHarv_00005232–35].  This document, however, is \nundated, and it was not circulated until May 29, 2025; thus, its only appearance in the \nadministrative record is, necessarily, after the Freeze Orders were issued.  \n69 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 70 of 84\nthe Congressional Staff Report raised antisemitism concerns at Harvard, Harvard began \nimplementing reforms, which were publicly announced and widely reported.  These included:  \n•  creating the Harvard Task Force;  \n•  disciplining students and faculty who violate applicable policies; enhancing \nprograms and policies designed to address bias and promote ideological \ndiversity and civil discourse;  \n•  adopting new accountability procedures and clarified policies, including \nspecifying  that  protests  are  not  permitted  in  classrooms,  libraries, \ndormitories, dining halls, Harvard offices, and other places where they \nwould  interfere  with  normal  activities,  and  they  expressly  prohibit \nunauthorized encampments, exhibits, and displays on campus;  \n•  supplementing existing safety and security measures;  \n•  refining procedures and protections for reporting misconduct; and making \nseveral leadership and personnel changes.   \n \n[Harvard SOF ¶¶ 5–8].30  Yet, the record does not reflect that Defendants ever acknowledged or \nconsidered these reforms or what impact Harvard’s own efforts should have on the decision to \nterminate funding.  When Defendants accused Harvard of failing to combat antisemitism in the \nApril 11 Letter, Harvard responded by detailing the steps taken and progress made, both via a \nletter and in President Garber’s public statements.  See [HHSHarv_00000104–05 (Harvard April \n14 rejection letter outlining steps to combat antisemitism on campus and noting “[i]t is \nunfortunate, then, that [the April 11 L]etter disregards Harvard’s efforts”)]; [Harvard SOF ¶ 42 \n(President Garber’s April 14 statements outlining university response to antisemitism)].  Again, \nthere is no evidence in the record that Defendants ever considered these reforms or Harvard’s \n \n \n30 The Court notes that the administrative record does not include all of Harvard’s various \nstatements and announcements regarding measures it has taken or will take to combat \nantisemitism, including President Garber’s April 14, 2025 statement outlining those efforts.  The \nCourt takes those statements into account, however, as it finds that Harvard’s response to \nantisemitism is a factor that Defendants should have considered when deciding whether to \nterminate funding based on Harvard’s response to antisemitism.  See Esch v. Yeutter, 876 F.2d \n976, 991 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (“[E]xceptions to the general rule [against going beyond the \nadministrative record] have been recognized . . . when the agency failed to consider factors \nwhich are relevant to its final decision.”). \n70 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 71 of 84\nattention to the problem of antisemitism, despite declaring on April 14, 2025 that Harvard had \nnot done enough.31   \nFourth, the administrative record does not indicate that Defendants considered the \npotential societal costs to Harvard, the American public generally, Jews in particular, or even the \ngovernment itself of freezing the underlying research.  Cf. Michigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 759 \n(2015) (“The Agency must consider cost—including, most importantly, cost of compliance—\nbefore deciding whether regulation is appropriate and necessary.”).  As Harvard explains,  \nIn  addition  to  canceling  military  research  pivotal  to  national  security,  the \n[g]overnment  ordered  immunologists  overseeing  a  multi-school  tuberculosis \nconsortium to immediately stop research, HHSHarv_00005181, told a Harvard \nresearcher at the Wyss Institute to halt his development of an advanced chip \ndesigned to measure NASA astronauts’ radiation exposure during the upcoming \nArtemis II mission to the Moon, HHSHarv_00004937, and directed yet another \nWyss Institute scientist, a recipient of the nation’s highest honor for technological \nachievement, to cease his research into Lou Gehrig’s disease, HHSHarv_00005228. \nOfficials at the Department of Veterans Affairs have begun the process of cutting \nfunding for research into, among other lifesaving measures, “a predictive model to \nhelp V.A. emergency room physicians decide whether suicidal veterans should be \nhospitalized.” See HHSHarv_00002326. This is sadly just the tip of the iceberg, as \nfuture projects at Harvard of a similar caliber are now categorically barred from \neven being considered for federal support. \n \n[Harvard, ECF No. 70 at 55 (footnotes omitted)].  It is difficult if not impossible to conclude that \nDefendants considered all important aspects of the problem where the record reveals that they \ncancelled this broad swath of critical research without any consideration as to whether there were \nless restrictive alternatives or alternatives that would preserve the value and continuity of \nresearch already in progress.  Research that has been frozen could save lives, money, or the \n \n \n31 The Harvard Task Force Report itself contains an appendix that details the actions Harvard has \ntaken to combat antisemitism, which Defendants do not seem to have considered even by the \ntime they terminated funding.  [GSAHarv_00000327–34 (“Appendix 1: Recent Progress on \nAddressing Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias Across Harvard.”)].   \n71 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 72 of 84\nenvironment, to name a few.  And the research was frozen without any sort of investigation into \nwhether particular labs were engaging in antisemitic behavior, were employing Jews, were run \nby Jewish scientists, or were investigating issues or diseases particularly pertinent to Jews (such \nas, for example, Tay-Sachs disease), meaning that the funding freezes could and likely will harm \nthe very people Defendants professed to be protecting.  And it is unlikely that any Jew, even one \ndirectly impacted by antisemitism would be in favor of stopping research on, for example, \nAlzheimer’s disease, heart disease, or autism to name a few, as a means of redressing their \nunrelated harm.   \nFinally, the decades of reliance interests that have been engendered by the government’s \nprior practice of supporting Harvard as a research institution compound the problem of \nDefendants’ lack of reasoned explanation and failure to consider important aspects of freezing \nfunding.  Housatonic River Initiative v. U.S. Env’t Prot. Agency, 75 F.4th 248, 270 (1st Cir. \n2023) (“A more detailed justification may be required . . . when the agency’s prior position has \nengendered serious reliance interests.” (citation modified)).  Harvard scientists and other \nresearchers have operated for years under the assumption that they would be able to continue to \ncompete on fair terms for federal funding, build and staff their labs, create collaborations with \nother university research teams, and continue to be financially able to engage in and complete \ncutting-edge work aimed at important and beneficial scientific advances.  To upend the \nlongstanding, collaborative relationship between the government and Harvard and its partner \ninstitutions without considering alternatives or articulating a connection to the problem of \nantisemitism sounds in arbitrariness and reeks of pretext.  \nIn sum, the Freeze Orders, on their face, purport to explain the decision to terminate \nfunding as based on Harvard’s failure to address antisemitism or uphold civil rights laws.  It is \n72 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 73 of 84\ndifficult, however, if not impossible, for this Court to view that explanation as “reasoned” when \nthe administrative record reflects that, before freezing nearly $2.2 billion in federal grants, the \nagencies considered little, if any, data regarding the antisemitism problem at Harvard, \ndisregarded the substantial policy and other changes Harvard had taken and was continuing to \ntake to address the issue, and failed to weigh the importance of any particular grant or to evaluate \nwhether a particular grant recipient had engaged in antisemitic behavior before cutting off \ncritical research.  Although this Court may not “substitute its judgment for that of the \nagenc[ies],” Fox Television Stations, 556 U.S. at 513 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 54), “it \nmust ensure, among other things, that the agency has offered ‘a satisfactory explanation for its \naction[,] including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made,’” Ohio, \n603 U.S. at 292 (quoting State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43).  It is that rational connection between the \ngrant terminations and the fight against antisemitism that is wholly lacking here.  Therefore, \nPlaintiffs’ motions for summary judgment are GRANTED as to their arbitrary and capricious \nclaims regarding the Freeze Orders, and Defendants’ corresponding motions are DENIED.  \nD.  Ultra Vires Claims for First Amendment and Title VI Violations \nBoth Harvard and the Organizational Plaintiffs move for summary judgment on their \nultra vires First Amendment claims, and Harvard additionally moves for summary judgment as \nto its ultra vires claim for violations of Title VI.  Defendants cross move for summary judgment \non the same claims.   \n“Before enactment of the APA, those challenging agency action often lacked a statutory \ncause of action,” but “courts recognized a right to equitable relief where an agency’s action was \nultra vires—that is, ‘unauthorized by any law and . . . in violation of the rights of the \nindividual.’”  Nuclear Regul. Comm’n v. Texas, 605 U.S. 665, 680 (2025) (quoting Am. Sch. of \n73 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 74 of 84\nMagnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902)).  “Since the APA was enacted, \nhowever, the Supreme Court has ‘strictly limited nonstatutory ultra vires review’ to avoid \ncreating an ‘easy end-run around the limitations of . . . judicial-review statutes.’”  Am. Ctr. for \nInt’l Lab. Solidarity v. Chavez-DeRemer, No. 25-cv-1128, 2025 WL 1795090, at *27 (D.D.C. \nJune 30, 2025) (quoting Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 605 U.S. at 681).  As it currently stands, ultra \nvires review “applies only when an agency has taken action entirely ‘in excess of its delegated \npowers and contrary to a specific prohibition’ in a statute.”  Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 605 U.S. at \n681 (quoting Ry. Clerks v. Ass’n for Benefit of Non-Contract Emps., 380 U.S. 650, 660 (1965)).  \nSuch review is unavailable if “a statutory review scheme provides aggrieved persons ‘with a \nmeaningful and adequate opportunity for judicial review.’”  Id. (quoting Bd. of Governors of the \nFed. Rsrv. Sys. v. MCorp Fin., Inc., 502 U.S. 32, 43 (1991)).  An ultra vires challenge “requires \nsatisfying the traditional factors for injunctive relief, since this type of review ‘is a suit in \nequity.’”  Am. Ctr. for Int’l Lab. Solidarity, 2025 WL 1795090, at *27 (quoting Am. Foreign \nServ. Ass’n v. Trump, No. 25-cv-5184, 2025 WL 1742853, at *2 (D.D.C. June 20, 2025)). \nThe Organizational Plaintiffs offer no particularized argument in support of their \nequitable cause of action under the First Amendment, essentially conflating it with their APA \nclaim.  Harvard, likewise, offers little argument in support of its ultra vires claims, arguing them \nprimarily in the alternative to its claims under the APA.  See [Harvard, ECF No. 70 at 58 (“Even \nif APA review were not available here (it is), the [g]overnment’s actions should still be set aside \nas ultra vires.”)].  It overall contends that “the [g]overnment’s actions are flagrantly in violation \nof the First Amendment.  And it has ignored the mandatory statutory requirements to revoke \nfederal funding to a university based on allegations of antisemitism.”  [Id.].  Defendants respond \nthat 1) by failing to engage with the ultra vires standard, Harvard has effectively waived the \n74 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 75 of 84\nargument, 2) the plain language of Title VI provides for judicial review, and 3) the constitutional \nclaims are barred by the Tucker Act.  [ECF No. 186 at 37–39].   \n  The Court finds neither party’s arguments particularly helpful.  Given, however, \nPlaintiffs’ limited briefing on the issue, their success on their APA challenges, and the Supreme \nCourt’s guidance that “ultra vires review is not available [where Plaintiffs] ha[ve] an alternative \npath to judicial review,” Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 605 U.S. at 682, the Court GRANTS \nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs’ equitable and ultra vires claims, \nwhich are Count 2 in the Harvard action and Count III in the Organizational Plaintiffs’ action.  \nE.  Due Process Claims  \nDefendants move for summary judgment on the Organizational Plaintiffs’ procedural due \nprocess claims, one of which is brought under the APA and the other ultra vires, arguing \nprimarily that the Organizational Plaintiffs do not have a protected property interest in their \nfederal grants.  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 50–52; AAUP, ECF No. 130 at 36].  The Organizational \nPlaintiffs did not move for summary judgment on their due process claims, but they oppose \n(albeit briefly) Defendants’ motion on the grounds that they have a protected liberty interest (as \ndistinct from a property interest)—referring to their First Amendment interests, discussed at \nlength supra.  [AAUP, ECF No. 110 at 41].  Because Defendants’ arguments largely talk past the \nOrganizational Plaintiffs’ claims,32 the Court cannot find that they are entitled to judgment as a \n \n \n32 Defendants’ response to the Organizational Plaintiffs’ assertion of a liberty interest is limited \nto arguing that a void for vagueness challenge can only be brought against statutes or regulations \nthat govern primary conduct.  [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 50].  Defendants’ cited authority, \nhowever, is not so narrow, and given, as discussed supra, that the Organizational Plaintiffs’ \nviewpoints and related research are the targets of the April 11 Letter’s unclear and \nunconstitutional demands, the Court is unconvinced that summary judgment should be granted in \nfavor of Defendants as to the due process claims at this stage.  San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. \n \n75 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 76 of 84\nmatter of law.  See Bauer v. Montgomery, 215 F.3d 656, 662 (6th Cir. 2000) (reversing district \ncourt grant of summary judgment on procedural due process claim where plaintiff had otherwise \n“established sufficient facts to preclude summary judgment on his First Amendment claim”); \nAguiar-Carrasquillo v. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2006) (summary judgment \nappropriate only where moving party “has met its burden to demonstrate undisputed facts \nentitling it to summary judgment as a matter of law” (citation omitted)).  As such, Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment as to Count VIII, the Organizational Plaintiffs’ APA claim, is \nDENIED.  That said, because the Organizational Plaintiffs have a remedy at law, the Court \nGRANTS Defendants’ motion as to the ultra vires claim, Count VII.   \nF.  Separation of Powers/Spending Clause Claims \nDefendants move for summary judgment as to the Organizational Plaintiffs’ separation of \npowers claims, one of which is styled as an ultra vires claim (Count V) and the other of which is \nbrought pursuant to the APA (Count VI).  Defendants argue that 1) “the Executive has both \nexpress and implied authority to terminate individual grants,” 2) the Organizational Plaintiffs’ \n“separation of powers and spending clause arguments are merely repackaged claims under Title \nVI, which fail for the reasons outlined above,” and 3) “the [g]overnment’s cancellation of \nfunding due to concerns regarding compliance with antidiscrimination laws is entirely proper.”  \n[AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 47–49].  Defendants, however, cite no legal authority to support their \npurported express and implied authority to terminate individual grants, and this Court has already \n \n \nTrump, No. 25-cv-01824, 2025 WL 1621636, at *20 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025) (rejecting \ndefendants’ primary conduct argument where challenged directives implicated “the traditional \nconcerns under the vagueness doctrine, i.e., that they d[id] not give fair notice so that grantees \ncan act accordingly, and they encourage[d] arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement by the \nimplementing agencies”).   \n \n76 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 77 of 84\nfound that the termination violated Title VI and the First Amendment.  As such, the Court finds \nDefendants arguments unavailing and DENIES their motion for summary judgment as to Count \nVI.  That said, as explained supra, the Organizational Plaintiffs’ substantially similar ultra vires \nclaim cannot proceed where the Organizational Plaintiffs have “an alternative path to judicial \nreview,” Nuclear Regul. Comm’n, 605 U.S. at 682, in this instance under the APA.  Defendants’ \nmotion for summary judgment as to Count V is therefore GRANTED.   \nG.  Permanent Injunction  \nIn addition to seeking vacatur of the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706, Plaintiffs also request a permanent injunction against any unconstitutional \nconditions imposed to date, and which prohibits Defendants from “[i]ssuing any other \ntermination, freezing of funds, stop work orders, or withholding of payment on existing grants or \nother federal funding, or refusal to award future grants, contracts, or other federal funding to \n[Harvard] in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on purported grounds \nof discrimination without compliance with the terms of Title VI.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 69-1 at 2]; \nsee also [AAUP, ECF No. 64 at Prayer for Relief (similar)].  “Where a plaintiff seeks permanent \ninjunctive relief, the test is the same [as for preliminary injunctive relief], except that ‘the \nmovant must show actual success on the merits of the claim, rather than a mere likelihood of \nsuccess.’”  Esso Standard Oil Co. v.

Lopez-Freytes, 522 F.3d 136 (1st Cir. 2008).  \nThe plaintiff must also demonstrate that it “would be irreparably injured in the absence of \ninjunctive relief,” that “the harm to [plaintiff] from defendant’s conduct would exceed the harm \nto the defendant accruing from the issuance of an injunction,” and “that the public interest would \nnot be adversely affected by an injunction.”  Id. at 168 (citation omitted). \n77 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 78 of 84\nDefendants do not dispute that the loss of First Amendment freedoms would constitute \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs, nor do they dispute that the balancing of harms and the public \ninterest favor granting permanent injunctive relief.  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 61–63; Harvard, \nECF No. 223 at 33]; [AAUP, ECF No. 104 at 52–55; AAUP, ECF No. 130 at 37].  Rather, \nDefendants oppose Plaintiffs’ request on the grounds that “any relief should be limited to \nremedying improper agency action and must leave intact the Executive Branch’s discretion to \nengage in further consideration of the topic at hand and consider other future agency actions \nconsistent with law.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 186 at 61].  Harvard, in particular, responds that it \n“does not request an injunction that would prevent the [g]overnment from initiating proper \ninvestigations in full conformance with the Title VI process.”  [Harvard, ECF No. 211 at 40].  \nRather, “[i]t simply requests that the [g]overnment be enjoined from depriving Harvard of \nfunding as a form of retaliation for Harvard’s exercise of its First Amendment rights, in a repeat \nof what has transpired over the last several months and in a manner that fails to follow the \nprocedural requirements set forth in Title VI and the individual agency Defendants’ \nimplementing regulations.”  [Id.].  Harvard further asserts that Defendants’ suggestion that “the \nonly improper agency action to be remedied is the agencies’ decisions to terminate existing \ngrants,” is incorrect and that “injunctive relief is necessary here because of the [g]overnment’s \nfurther categorical, across-the-board policy that Harvard is ineligible for any future grants.”  [Id. \nat 39].   \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs.  They have succeeded on their First Amendment claims, \nas well as their Title VI claims.  It goes without saying that this Court cannot and will not enjoin \nDefendants from acting within their constitutional, statutory, or regulatory authority, nor does it \nconstrue Plaintiffs as requesting that it do so.  But, given the First Amendment violations, the \n78 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 79 of 84\nharms to Harvard’s research, and the benefit to the public of that research continuing, the Court \ngrants Harvard’s request for a permanent injunction that prevents Defendants reimposing any \nunconstitutional conditions imposed to date, and enjoins Defendants from issuing any other \ntermination, freezing of funds, stop work orders, or withholding of payment on existing grants or \nother federal funding, or refusal to award future grants, contracts, or other federal funding to \nHarvard in retaliation for the exercise of its First Amendment rights, or on purported grounds of \ndiscrimination without compliance with the requirements of Title VI. \nVII.  CONCLUSION  \nThis case, of course, raises complicated and important legal issues, but, at its core, it \nconcerns the future of grants sponsoring research that promises to benefit significantly the health \nand welfare of our country and the world.  Through the government’s statements and actions, the \nfate of that research has now become intertwined with the issue of antisemitism at Harvard.  \nAntisemitism, like other types of discrimination or prejudice, is intolerable.  And it is clear, even \nbased solely on Harvard’s own admissions, that Harvard has been plagued by antisemitism in \nrecent years and could (and should) have done a better job of dealing with the issue.  That said, \nthere is, in reality, little connection between the research affected by the grant terminations and \nantisemitism.  In fact, a review of the administrative record makes it difficult to conclude \nanything other than that Defendants used antisemitism as a smokescreen for a targeted, \nideologically-motivated assault on this country’s premier universities, and did so in a way that \nruns afoul of the APA, the First Amendment and Title VI.  Further, their actions have \njeopardized decades of research and the welfare of all those who could stand to benefit from that \nresearch, as well as reflect a disregard for the rights protected by the Constitution and federal \nstatutes.     \n79 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 80 of 84\nWith respect to the difficult jurisdictional issues in this case, the Court has done its best \nto follow the Supreme Court’s limited recent guidance, which is preliminary and might well \nchange over the course of this litigation (and the many other cases involving similar issues)—an \noutcome that seems not unlikely given the seeming lack of consensus in APHA and the \nprocedural challenges posed by having substantially similar cases proceed in two different \nforums.  Although the doctrinal framework that applies to these threshold issues is certainly \nimportant, the issue of jurisdiction is something of a red herring.  Whether this case plays out in \nthis Court or in the Court of Federal Claims, what lies at the core of this dispute is the fact that \nDefendants are trying to pressure Harvard to accede to the government’s demands in a way that \nsquarely violates Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights and ignores the procedural requirements of \nTitle VI and, to a certain extent, the APA.  The idea that fighting antisemitism is Defendants’ \ntrue aim is belied by the fact that the majority of the demands they are making of Harvard to \nrestore its research funding are directed, on their face, at Harvard’s governance, staffing and \nhiring practices, and admissions policies—all of which have little to do with antisemitism and \neverything to do with Defendants’ power and political views.  \nThe First Amendment is important and the right to free speech must be zealously \nguarded.  Free speech has always been a hallmark of our democracy.  The Supreme Court itself \nhas recognized that efforts to educate people, change minds, and foster tolerance all benefit from \nmore open communication, not less.  As Justice Brandeis wrote in the seminal case of Whitney \nv. California, “[i]f there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert \nthe evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced \nsilence,” 274 U.S. 357, 377 (1927) (Brandeis, J., concurring), or, in this case, the forced adoption \nof a political orthodoxy.  As pertains to this case, it is important to recognize and remember that \n80 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 81 of 84\nif speech can be curtailed in the name of the Jewish people today, then just as easily the speech \nof the Jews (and anyone else) can be curtailed when the political winds change direction.   \nDefendants and the President are right to combat antisemitism and to use all lawful \nmeans to do so.  Harvard was wrong to tolerate hateful behavior for as long as it did.  The record \nhere, however, does not reflect that fighting antisemitism was Defendants’ true aim in acting \nagainst Harvard and, even if it were, combatting antisemitism cannot be accomplished on the \nback of the First Amendment.  We must fight against antisemitism, but we equally need to \nprotect our rights, including our right to free speech, and neither goal should nor needs to be \nsacrificed on the altar of the other.  Harvard is currently, even if belatedly, taking steps it needs \nto take to combat antisemitism and seems willing to do even more if need be.  Now it is the job \nof the courts to similarly step up, to act to safeguard academic freedom and freedom of speech as \nrequired by the Constitution, and to ensure that important research is not improperly subjected to \narbitrary and procedurally infirm grant terminations, even if doing so risks the wrath of a \ngovernment committed to its agenda no matter the cost.     \nThe Court rules as follows:   \n1.  The Court GRANTS Harvard’s motion for summary judgment, [Harvard, ECF No. 69], \nas to Counts 1, 3, and 4 and Defendants’ cross motion for summary judgment, [Harvard, \nECF No. 185], as to Counts 2 and 6.  As to Count 5, the Court GRANTS IN PART \nHarvard’s motion with respect to the Freeze Orders and GRANTS IN PART \nDefendants’ motion with respect to the Termination Letters, which it lacks jurisdiction to \nreview under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  Harvard’s and Defendants’ summary judgment \nmotions in Case No. 25-cv-11048 are otherwise DENIED.  \n81 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-10910-ADB     Document 141     Filed 09/03/25     Page 82 of 84\n2.  The Court GRANTS the Organizational Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment, \n[AAUP, ECF No. 74], as to Counts I and IV and Defendants’ cross motion for summary \njudgment as to Counts III, V, and VII.  It DENIES Defendants’ cross motion, [AAUP, \nECF No. 103], as to Counts VI and VIII.  As to Count II, the Court GRANTS IN PART \nthe Organizational Plaintiffs’ motion with respect to the Freeze Orders and GRANTS IN \nPART Defendants’ motion with respect to the Termination Letters, which it lacks \njurisdiction to review under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  The Organizational Plaintiffs’ and \nDefendants’ summary judgment motions in Case No. 25-cv-10910 are otherwise \nDENIED. \nThe Court orders the following relief:  \n1.  The Court vacates and sets aside the Freeze Orders as arbitrary and capricious under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A).   \n2.  The Court vacates and sets aside the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters as violative \nof the First Amendment under 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B).  All freezes and terminations of \nfunding to Harvard made pursuant to the Freeze Orders and Termination Letters on or \nafter April 14, 2025 are vacated and set aside.  \n3.  The Court vacates and sets aside the Termination Letters as violative of Title VI under 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(C), (D).  All terminations of funding to Harvard made pursuant to the \nTermination Letters are vacated and set aside.  \n4.
