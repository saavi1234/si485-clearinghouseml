    "summary": "<p>This case was one of many challenges to the freezing of federal grant funds designated for green infrastructure projects. On April 21, 2025, Opportunity Finance Network (OFN) filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Represented by private counsel, OFN sued the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), its Administrator, and Citibank, N.A., a national banking association. OFN challenged the freezing of federal grants that it received through the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator fund, which is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund. The funds were to be used for the \"rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services.\" OFN, a nonprofit organization, served as a financial intermediary between Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) \"and public and private sector partners, including foundations, corporations, banks, government agencies, and others.\" Under OFN's grant agreement, Citibank holds dispersed funds and dispenses them to OFN at its request.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Since March 3, 2025, however, Citibank refused to disperse funds to OFN despite repeated requests. On March 11, OFN received a Notice of Termination from the EPA stating that OFN's grant agreement was terminated. In its complaint, OFN alleged that the EPA's actions were arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law under the Administrative Procedure Act. It also alleged that EPA violated the Inflation Reduction Act, which requires EPA \"to spend the funds appropriated for grants to be awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund\", and the Constitution's Appropriations Clause, separation of powers, and Due Process Clause. Against Citibank, OFN brought breach of contract, replevin, and conversion claims for the withholding of the funds. OFN requested the court to declare EPA's actions to be unlawful, to enjoin the EPA from removing the funds or terminating OFN's grant, and to order Citibank to release OFN's grant funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to Judge Tanya S. Chutkan. On May 9, the parties filed a joint motion to consolidate the case with other challenges to the EPA's actions in <a href=\"../../../../case/46274/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Climate United Fund v. Citibank.</a> The parties stipulated that, since \"OFN's grant is subject to the same constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions as the grant at issue\" in the other litigation, the court should consolidate the cases. Furthermore, since the court in&nbsp;<em>Climate United Fund</em>&nbsp;had issued a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendants from terminating the grants or withdrawing the funds from Citibank, the EPA and OFN agreed that the EPA would adhere to the same restrictions with regard to OFN's funds.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2025, Judge Chutkan issued an order consolidating the cases. Judge Chutkan ordered <em>Climate United Fund</em> to be designated as the lead case, and all other filings (and updates) regarding this case are to be made there.&nbsp;</p>",

Broad Street Suite 1930   \nPhiladelphia, PA 19109   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n   \nv.   \n   \nCITIBANK, N.A.,  ECF CASE \n5800 South Corporate Place   \nSioux Falls, South Dakota 57108,  No. _____ \n   \nand    \n   \nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL \nPROTECTION AGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460, \n \nand  \n \nLEE ZELDIN, in his official capacity as \nADMINISTRATOR, UNITED STATES \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \nAGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460 \n \nDefendants. \n \n \n \nCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF \n \n1.  This case seeks to vindicate the rights of Plaintiff Opportunity Finance Network \n(“OFN”) to access grant funds to which it is legally entitled. EPA, through its purported “Notice \nof Termination,” has unlawfully attempted to terminate OFN’s grant and caused OFN’s funds held \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 2 of 50\n \nat Citibank, N.A. (“Citibank”) to be withheld. OFN seeks to enjoin those ongoing, unlawful \nactions, which had nothing to do with OFN’s performance under the grant.  \n2.  OFN received its grant funds under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator \nfund (“CCIA”), which is part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund (“GGRF”) created by \nCongress in the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”), Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818.  As a result, \nthe facts alleged and claims asserted herein are substantially similar to those asserted in six \nconsolidated cases involving grants under the GGRF that are already before this Court, in which \nthis Court recently issued a preliminary injunction. See Climate United Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. \n25-cv-698 (filed Mar. 8, 2025) (Dkts. 80, 89) (“Climate United PI Decision”). These cases include \nJustice Climate Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-938 (filed Mar. 31, 2025) and Inclusiv, Inc. v. \nEPA, No. 25-cv-948 (filed Mar. 31, 2025) (collectively, the “CCIA Litigation”), as well as Climate \nUnited Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-698-TSC (filed Mar. 8, 2025) (hereinafter Climate \nUnited); Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-735-TSC (filed Mar. 12, 2025); \nPower Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-762-TSC (filed Mar. 14, 2025); \nand California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-820 \n(filed March 19, 2025) (collectively, the “NCIF Litigation\").  \n3.  The GGRF provides financial assistance for “the rapid deployment of low- and \nzero-emission products, technologies, and services.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(c)(1). EPA administers the \nGGRF through three different programs: the CCIA, the National Clean Investment Fund (“NCIF”), \nand Solar for All. OFN’s grant was awarded under the CCIA program. \n4.  The CCIA provides financing for qualifying projects to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. CCIA grants are used by recipients to provide capital and technical assistance to smaller \ncommunity lenders working in low-income and disadvantaged communities across the United \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 3 of 50\n \nStates, which, in turn, provide financing to support investments in qualifying projects undertaken \nby their respective lenders.  \n5.  OFN is a nonprofit organization and a leading national network of more than 470 \nCommunity  Development  Financial  Institutions  (“CDFIs”)  and  mission-driven  community \nlenders. CDFIs are lenders that specialize in lending to individuals, organizations, and businesses \nin under-resourced communities, helping those entities obtain financing that they typically could \nnot obtain through traditional financing channels. OFN serves as a financial intermediary between \nCDFIs  and  public  and  private  sector  partners,  including  foundations,  corporations,  banks, \ngovernment agencies, and others. OFN’s mission—and the work of its network of CDFIs—is to \nensure communities underserved by mainstream finance have access to affordable, responsible \nfinancial products and services, with a focus on serving low-income and underserved rural, urban, \nand Native communities across the United States. \n6.  OFN has built a 40-year track record, managing billions of dollars in assets to \ndeliver access to capital. It provides high-quality capacity-building events, trainings, toolkits, and \nother resources for CDFIs. And it provides access to affordable, responsible credit that finances \ncommunity businesses, sparks job growth, and delivers sound financial returns. OFN has been a \ndriving force in building safe and affordable housing, lowering energy costs, creating jobs, and \nimproving water and air quality, and in turn, OFN has made the United States more competitive, \nsecure, and energy independent. \n7.  On October 10, 2023, OFN applied for CCIA grant funding from EPA. OFN was \ninformed  that  it  was  selected  as  a  CCIA  grantee  on  March  31,  2024,  and  its  award  was \nmemorialized in a final grant agreement on August 8, 2024. Since that date, OFN has diligently \nworked to carry out its responsibilities under the grant program.  \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 4 of 50\n \n8.  The CCIA grant requires OFN’s grant funds to be held at Citibank, under a \nFinancial  Agent  Agreement  (“FAA”)  between  Citibank  and  the  U.S.  Treasury  Department \n(“Treasury”), and an Account Control Agreement (“ACA”) between Citibank, OFN, and EPA that \nsets forth the specific requirements for EPA to exercise “control” as a secured party. EPA \ncontemplated this arrangement from the program’s inception—and described it in the original \nNotice of Funding Opportunity (“NOFO”) in July 2023 as critical both to allow recipients to \nleverage private capital and to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” NOFO at 58. EPA \ndesigned,  structured,  and  negotiated  the  FAA1 and  the  ACA  to  provide  transparency  and \naccountability. The ACA includes provisions that allow EPA to take exclusive control of the funds \nat Citibank under certain specified conditions. Unless EPA takes exclusive control of the funds, \nCitibank must disburse funds to OFN at OFN’s request. \n9.  EPA has never attempted to exercise its right to take exclusive control of the funds \nthrough legal means—nor could it, because the preconditions for exercising that right have not \noccurred.  \n10.  Nonetheless, EPA’s Administrator has made several public statements expressing \nhostility to the GGRF program. For instance, he stated on national television, without basis, that \n“the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.” He has also publicly stated that EPA is “not going \nto rest” until it has “recovered” those funds. On March 4, 2025, he publicly stated that the “money \nis now FROZEN.” EPA has also undertaken behind-the-scenes efforts to cause Citibank to \nwithhold OFN’s funds. These efforts resulted in the public resignation of the Chief of the Criminal \n \n1 Pursuant to the March 12, 2025, sealing order in Climate United Fund v. Citibank, N.A. (“Climate \nUnited”), No. 25-cv-698-TSC, OFN quotes only those portions of the FAA quoted in Citibank’s \npublicly filed opposition to Climate United’s motion for a temporary restraining order in that case. \nThe FAA is available at Climate United, Dkt. No. 14.  \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 5 of 50\n \nDivision of the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office following her refusal to carry out an illegal directive \nto send a letter to Citibank demanding that it freeze GGRF funds. \n11.  These  efforts  eventually  worked,  as  Citibank  now  refuses  to  honor  OFN’s \ndisbursement  requests,  despite  Citibank’s  unambiguous  contractual  obligation  to  do  so.  On \nFebruary 26, 2025, OFN sent a request for Citibank to transfer a portion of OFN’s funds from one \nof its Citibank accounts to another. Citibank did not do so. On February 28, 2025, OFN sent a \nfollow-up email to Citibank inquiring, among other things, into the status of the transfer and noting \nthat OFN would shortly submit a request to draw funds from its account. Again, Citibank did not \ncomplete the transfer. On March 3, 2025, OFN instructed Citibank to draw funds from its account. \nCitibank did not follow OFN’s instructions, and OFN was prevented from accessing its own grant \nfunds.  \n12.  Since March 3, 2025, Citibank has refused OFN access to any of its grant funds. \nSince then, EPA also has failed to provide additional information about the status of OFN’s \nfunding with OFN. \n13.  On March 11, 2025, OFN received a purported Notice of Termination (“Notice”) \nletter from EPA Acting Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh stating that “effective immediately,” \n“the Agency is terminating [the Grant Agreement] awarded to Opportunity Finance Network.” \nNotice at 1. This purported termination was sent to all recipients of CCIA and NCIF grant awards, \nwith no substantive differences in the stated bases for the termination.  \n14.  In fact, EPA has no legal basis for causing Citibank to deny OFN’s disbursement \nrequests or for terminating OFN’s grant award. Under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), \nEPA’s de facto suspension and purported termination of OFN’s grant is arbitrary, capricious, and \nnot in accordance with law.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 6 of 50\n \n15.  Citibank likewise has no legal basis for its actions. The ACA does not allow \nCitibank to withhold OFN’s grant funds—nor permit it to allow EPA to claw back funds—unless \nand until EPA has given notice that it intends to exercise exclusive control over the accounts. EPA \nhas not done so and cannot possibly do so because there is no legal justification for such an action. \nThe FAA, to which OFN is not a party, only permits Citibank to freeze assets “in accordance with \nthe [ACAs],” FAA Ex. A § I.B.4, and only in response to “lawful instructions or directions” from \nTreasury, FAA § 5.A. But Citibank did not freeze OFN’s funds “in accordance with” the ACA, \nand Citibank did not receive any “lawful instructions or directions” from Treasury to freeze OFN’s \nfunds. \n16.  By failing to disburse OFN’s grant funds, Citibank is in breach of the ACA and has \nwrongfully withheld the grant funds that OFN has an immediate legal right to possess. \n17.  Defendants’ unlawful actions are causing OFN to suffer real and immediate harm. \nOFN’s other sources of funding are insufficient to replace the CCIA grant funds that it can no \nlonger access. OFN has already paused virtually all contracted support for its CCIA initiatives, \nsignificantly curtailed program implementation, and paused its signature training program. More \nthan half of OFN’s 81 staff support the CCIA grant and rely on the grant to pay at least some \nportion of their salaries. Unless access to grant funding is restored soon, OFN will be forced to lay \noff staff to manage its operating deficit. In addition, OFN has been unable to award over $228 \nmillion to entities it has already selected to receive subawards to carry out CCIA projects, and it \nhas already lost valuable funding opportunities, including $125 million worth of investments in \nrural American communities. OFN’s inability to honor commitments and serve as a stable partner \nwill erode trust in OFN as an institution, damage its reputation, and prevent it from fulfilling both \nits mission under the CCIA and its initiatives outside of the CCIA, causing OFN profound harm. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 7 of 50\n \nIt will also cause profound harm to the organizations that rely on OFN funds to develop critical \nprojects that reduce energy costs, create jobs, and strengthen communities.   \n18.  As in the consolidated CCIA Litigation and NCIF Litigation, EPA’s wrongful \ntermination should be enjoined as to OFN, and OFN’s access to its grant funds held at Citibank \nshould be restored. The Court should further direct Citibank to adhere to its contractual obligations \nand bar EPA from interfering with Citibank’s disbursements.  \n19.  For the reasons outlined in this Court’s recent opinion granting a preliminary \ninjunction in Climate United, this Court should likewise enjoin Defendants from unlawfully \ndenying OFN access to its grant funds. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n20.  This is an action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on EPA’s violation of \nthe Administrative Procedure Act, federal regulations and statutes, and the Due Process Clause. \nThis action also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against Citibank based on its breach of \ncontract, conversion, and replevin. \n21.  The Court has jurisdiction over OFN’s claims against Defendants EPA and Zeldin \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 5 U.S.C. § 706. See Climate United PI Decision at 16-26. \n22.  The Court has jurisdiction over OFN’s claims against Citibank under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1367, because those claims are so related to OFN’s claims against EPA that they are part of the \nsame case or controversy.2  \n \n2 Even if EPA was not named as a defendant, the Court would have jurisdiction over OFN’s claims \nagainst Citibank under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 because the parties are of diverse citizenship and the \namount in controversy exceeds $75,000. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 8 of 50\n \n23.  Venue is proper in this district because EPA is located in this district and a \nsubstantial part of the acts or omissions giving rise to the claim occurred in this district. 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1391(e). \nPARTIES \n24.  The Opportunity Finance Network is a nonprofit organization incorporated in the \nCommonwealth of Pennsylvania. OFN is a leading national network of more than 470 Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions and mission-driven community lenders nationwide, and a \nfinancial intermediary whose mission is to increase capital flow, strengthen CDFIs, and amplify \nthe voice of the CDFI industry. OFN works to ensure communities underserved by mainstream \nfinance have access to affordable, responsible financial products and services. \n25.  Defendant Citibank, N.A. is a national banking association organized and existing \nunder the laws of the United States of America, with headquarters in South Dakota. Citibank is the \nwholly owned subsidiary of Citigroup, Inc., headquartered in New York. \n26.  Defendant EPA is the agency of the federal government of the United States \nresponsible for administering the GGRF and its constituent NCIF program. EPA is an agency \nwithin the meaning of the APA.  \n27.  Defendant Lee Zeldin is the EPA Administrator and the agency’s highest ranking \nofficial. OFN sues Administrator Zeldin in his official capacity.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  Congress Establishes the CCIA Program. \n \n28.  In  2022,  Congress  passed  and  President  Biden  signed  into  law  the  Inflation \nReduction Act (“IRA”). Pub. L. No. 117-169, 136 Stat. 1818. The Act amended the Clean Air Act \nto authorize the EPA to make competitive grants under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 9 of 50\n \nprovide financial assistance for “the rapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, \ntechnologies, and services.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434. In total, the IRA appropriated $27 billion to invest \nin clean energy in communities across the county. About the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, \nEPA, https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/about-greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund \n(last updated Feb. 13, 2025).  \n29.  The statute created this new program to leverage public funds with private capital \nand catalyze investment into places and projects that support local economic development, much \nlike other government programs such as Small Business Administration loan guarantees, New \nMarket Tax Credits, and Opportunity Zones. \n30.  Section 134(a)(3) of the Act appropriated to the EPA Administrator $8 billion to \n“make grants, on a competitive basis …, to eligible recipients for the purposes of providing \nfinancial assistance and technical assistance in low-income and disadvantaged communities in \naccordance with subsection (b).” Id. § 7434(a)(3). \n31.  In turn, subsection (b) provides that an eligible recipient shall use the grant in \naccordance with the following: (1) facilitating “financial assistance to qualified projects at the \nnational, regional, State, and local levels”; (2) prioritizing “investment in qualified projects that \nwould  otherwise  lack  access  to  financing”;  (3)  “retain[ing],  manag[ing],  recycl[ing],  and \nmonetiz[ing] all repayments and other revenue received from fees, interest, repaid loans, and all \nother types of  financial assistance provided using  grant  funds under this  section to  ensure \ncontinued operability”; and (4) providing “funding and technical assistance to establish new or \nsupport existing public, quasi-public, not-for-profit, or nonprofit entities that provide financial \nassistance to qualified projects.” Id. § 7434(b).  \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 10 of 50\n \n32.  Eligible recipients are defined to include nonprofit organizations that are “designed \nto provide capital, leverage private capital, and provide other forms of financial assistance for the \nrapid deployment of low- and zero-emission products, technologies, and services,” that do not \n“take deposits other than deposits from repayments and other revenue received from financial \nassistance provided using grant funds under this section,” that are “funded by public or charitable \ncontributions,” and that “invest[ ] in or finance[ ] projects alone or in conjunction with other \ninvestors.” Id. § 7434(c)(1).  \n33.  Qualified projects are defined to include any “project, activity, or technology” that \neither “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution in partnership \nwith, and by leveraging investment from, the private sector,” or “assists communities in the efforts \nof those communities to reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air \npollution.” Id. § 7434(c)(3).  \n34.  In July 2023, EPA launched three grant competitions: CCIA, NCIF, and Solar for \nAll.  The  $6  billion  CCIA  competition  focuses  entirely  on  “financ[ing]  clean  technology \ndeployment in low-income and disadvantaged communities while simultaneously building the \ncapacity of community lenders that serve those communities.” NOFO at 3.  \n35.  The purpose of the CCIA competition was to provide grants to 2-7 hub nonprofits \nthat, in turn, provide financing and technical assistance to specific industry networks of public, \nquasi-public, and nonprofit community lenders, supporting the goal that every community in the \ncountry have access to the capital needed to deploy clean technology projects in their homes, small \nbusinesses, schools, and community institutions. NOFO at 4.  \n36.  CCIA  recipients  are  nonprofit  organizations  that  award  grants  to  numerous \ncommunity lenders across the country that operate in low-income and disadvantaged communities.  \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 11 of 50\n \n37.  The Inflation Reduction Act provided that the EPA Administrator could award \ngrants “on a competitive basis” until September 30, 2024. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)-(3).  \nB.  OFN Is Awarded CCIA Grant Funding. \n \n38.  On July 14, 2023, EPA issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity for the CCIA. The \nNOFO included “a robust set of application requirements and corresponding evaluation criteria \nthat were used to assess materials submitted to meet those application requirements.3 “Application \nrequirements covered a diverse set of topics and included not just a detailed project narrative but \nalso a robust set of application attachments,” such as “organizational and governing documents; \nresumes of board members and senior management; legal and compliance risk management \npolicies  and  procedures;  financial  statements;  workplans  for  the  first  year  of  program \nimplementations, and budget narratives.”4 \n39.  EPA established a rigorous process to review and select applications. That process \nincluded  an  evaluation  of  each  applicant’s  program  plan,  organizational  capacity,  previous \nexperience managing third-party capital, and experience managing financial, credit, compliance, \nand other risks. The review was conducted by expert panels with broad and deep qualifications \nwho would then present rankings and recommendations to a Selection Official authorized to make \nthe final selection for awards. NOFO at 55.  \n40.  OFN was formed more than 40 years ago to empower mission-driven community \nlenders. OFN seeks to use its CCIA award to finance projects in housing, transportation, energy \ninfrastructure, and other initiatives across the United States. It seeks to do so consistent with its \n \n3 See also Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, Review and Selection Process, EPA (last updated \nAug.  16,  2024),  https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/review-and-selection-\nprocess.  \n4 Id. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 12 of 50\n \nmission to ensure communities underserved by mainstream finance have access to affordable, \nresponsible financial products and services, and to carry out Congress’ directive to invest in \ncommunities across America to create jobs and protect the environment. \n41.  On October 10, 2023, OFN applied to the CCIA grant competition with a $3.2 \nbillion proposal. As part of the application process, OFN was required to submit a detailed budget \nto EPA. Additionally, prior to receiving the Notice of Award, OFN was required to attach a \nnegotiated, thoroughly reviewed, and approved budget to its grant agreement with EPA.  \n42.  Following EPA’s lengthy and rigorous review process, OFN was awarded $2.29 \nbillion in CCIA grant funding. The award was announced in April 2024, in a press release touting \nOFN’s credentials and vision.5  \n43.  Consistent with the purpose of the Inflation Reduction Act under which the CCIA \nfunds were appropriated, OFN developed and EPA approved a workplan that was finalized with \nthe award and posted publicly for full transparency. As enumerated in the workplan, OFN plans to \nobligate at least $207 million in subawards in the first year of funding (i.e., before July 2025) that \nwill to be invested in qualified projects, and will draw upon the full $2.3 billion over the first six \nyears of the program. OFN has received and reviewed applications from a significant number of \ncommunity lenders and finalized its internal approval of initial subawards to 26 subrecipients \ntotaling more than $228 million. Without access to its CCIA award funds, OFN cannot distribute \nthat funding, and due to the freeze by Citibank, OFN cannot set up the subaward accounts for the \n26 subrecipients.  \n \n5 Biden-Harris Administration Announces $20 Billion in Grants to Mobilize Private Capital and \nDeliver Clean Energy and Climate Solutions to Communities Across America, EPA (last updated \nAug.  16,  2024),  https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-\nbillion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 13 of 50\n \nC.  The  Terms  and  Conditions  of  the  Grant,  Including  Suspending  or \nTerminating the Grant.  \n \n44.  The award was memorialized in a final grant agreement, known formally as a \nNotice of Award (“NOA”). The original NOA was dated August 8, 2024 (hereinafter “August \nNOA”). That NOA was then updated on December 12, 2024 (hereinafter “December NOA”).6 The \nDecember NOA sets forth the operative Terms and Conditions for OFN’s award. The operative \nTerms and Conditions of OFN’s grant are the same as for the other CCIA and NCIF grantees. \n45.  The  December  NOA  required  OFN  to  adhere  to  a  rigorous  set  of  reporting \nrequirements. These include requirements to produce semi-annual, annual, and final reports to \nEPA with “detailed narratives describing program performance … supported with qualitative \ndiscussions and quantitative metrics,” December NOA at 15, submit semi-annual transaction-level \nand project-level data reports, id. at 17, and provide ongoing disclosures to EPA, id. at 17-18.  \n46.  The Terms and Conditions provide that OFN “must obtain prior written approval \nfrom the EPA Project Officer (who will in turn notify the EPA Award Official) for any transfers \nthat will not be disbursed for an Allowable Activity within 15 business days.” Id. at 59. \n47.  In addition, the Terms and Conditions required OFN (as well as other GGRF \nrecipients) to complete standard EPA grants training within 90 days of receipt of the grant, \nincluding the “EPA Grants Management Training for Applicants and Recipients” and “How to \n \n6 The December NOA is substantially similar to the August NOA. The changes primarily reflected \nthe insights gained over time, but the December NOA did not alter the overall grant award or the \nunderlying reporting and transparency requirements. However, the December NOA updated \ncertain Terms and Conditions governing the grant. As relevant here, the December NOA updated \nthe Terms and Conditions to account for Citigroup being selected by the Treasury Department to \nserve as its financial agent; clarified the definitions of “Waste, Fraud, and Abuse” and “Materially \nImpaired”; clarified which versions of the applicable regulations govern termination of the grant; \nand specified certain procedures involved in issuing notices about the grant funds to financial \ninstitutions. Compare August NOA and December NOA. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 14 of 50\n \nDevelop a Budget.” Id. at 5. OFN complied with this requirement, even though OFN had already \nsubmitted a detailed budget to EPA in connection with the grant competition selection process, \nand had already attached a negotiated, reviewed, and approved budget to its grant agreement before \nreceiving the Notice of Award. \n48.  Like with other CCIA and NCIF grants, the Terms and Conditions of OFN’s grant \nconstrain EPA’s ability to unilaterally suspend the award or prevent OFN from accessing its funds. \nSee Climate United PI Decision at 4-6. Instead, the Terms and Conditions specify that EPA can \nsuspend or terminate OFN’s CCIA funds in three (and only three) scenarios. December NOA at \n43. \na.  First,  EPA  may  terminate  the  Agreement  if  OFN  engages  in  “substantial” \nnoncompliance such that “effective performance” is “Materially Impaired.” Id. \nEffective  performance  is  “Materially  Impaired”  if  (1)  EPA  issues  a  “written \ndetermination and finding … that the Recipient has failed to achieve sufficient \nprogress  in  accordance  with  the  Sufficient  Progress  clause”  and,  (2)  if  EPA \ndetermines in its sole discretion that a “corrective action plan” would remedy the \nissue, EPA must issue a “separate written determination and finding” that the \nRecipient “has not materially addressed its failure.” Id. at 10.  \nb.  Second,  EPA  may  terminate  the  Agreement  if  OFN  engages  in  “material \nmisrepresentation of eligibility status.” Id. at 43.  \nc.  Third, EPA may terminate the Agreement for “Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” id., which \nis defined with reference to the EPA General Terms and Conditions and 2 C.F.R. § \n200.113, id. at 14. Those sources require “credible evidence of the commission of \na violation of Federal criminal law involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 15 of 50\n \ngratuity violations found in Title 18 of the United States Code or a violation of the \ncivil False Claims Act (31 U.S.C. §§ 3729-3733).” See EPA, General Terms and \nConditions (effective Oct. 1, 2024), https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/\n2024-10/fy_2025_epa_general_terms_and_conditions_effective_october_1_2024\n_or_later.pdf; 2 C.F.R. § 200.113. \n49.  In addition, EPA is obligated by regulation to take certain procedural steps to \nterminate the grant agreement. Among other things, EPA must comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.341, \nwhich requires EPA to provide written notice of termination to the recipient that includes “the \nreasons for termination, the effective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, \nif  applicable.”  2  C.F.R.  § 200.341;  December  NOA  at  43  (incorporating  this  regulatory \nrequirement into the Terms and Conditions).  \n50.  The Terms and Conditions may not be unilaterally modified by either party. Rather \n“[t]he EPA Award Official and Grants Management Officer and the Recipient must agree to any \nmodifications to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement. Agreed-upon modifications \nmust be in writing. Oral or unilateral modifications shall not be effective or binding.” December \nNOA at 54. \nD.  The Account Control Agreement Between OFN, EPA, and Citibank. \n \n51.  The grant agreement required OFN to enter into an Account Control Agreement. \nOFN entered into the ACA with EPA and Citibank on November 1, 2024. OFN’s ACA is \nessentially identical to the ACAs that Citibank entered into with other CCIA and NCIF grantees. \nSee Climate United PI Decision at 6-8. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 16 of 50\n \n52.  Under the ACA, Citibank administers the funds provided under the CCIA, in its \nrole “as a financial agent of the United States pursuant to the authority” of Treasury, and EPA \nserves as the “Secured Party.” ACA at 2.  \n53.  The ACA specifies that Citibank’s duties with respect to the funding are exclusively \n“administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature).” ACA at 3. The \nACA further specifies that Citibank “shall not be responsible for any of the agreements referred to \nor described herein (including, without limitation, the Grant Agreement …), or for determining or \ncompelling compliance therewith, and shall not otherwise be bound thereby.” Id.  \n54.  Citibank is required to disburse funds to OFN upon OFN’s request. ACA § 2 \nprovides that Citibank “shall comply with all instructions, notifications, and entitlement orders the \nBank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the Accounts including, \nwithout limitation, directions to distribute proceeds of any such transfer or redemption of interest \nor dividends on financial assets in the Accounts.” \n55.  The only circumstance contemplated by the ACA under which Citibank could \nrefuse to disburse funds as directed by OFN is if EPA exercises its “right of control” under the \nACA. Id. at 2. \n56.  To exercise its right of control, EPA must notify Citibank of its intention to exercise \nexclusive control over the accounts, in a form substantially similar to a sample Notice of Exclusive \nControl contained in the ACA. Id.; see also id. at 2 (stating that OFN and EPA “have agreed that \nthe terms and conditions entitled ‘Deposit Account at Financial Agent’ in the Grant Agreement \nindicate the conditions under which the [EPA] may exercise its right of control”). \n57.  The form Notice of Exclusive Control states: “As required by the Grant Agreement, \nthe Secured Party [i.e., EPA] has issued a written determination and finding that Pledgor [i.e., \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 17 of 50\n \nOFN] has failed to comply with the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and that \nnoncompliance is substantial such that effective performance of the Grant Agreement is Materially \nImpaired or there is adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse (as defined in the Grant \nAgreement) or material misrepresentation of eligibility status, and that the Secured Party has \ninitiated  action  under  2  CFR  200.339  to  wholly  or  partly  suspend  or  terminate  the  Grant \nAgreement, as authorized in the terms of the Grant Agreement.” Id. at 10.  \n58.  The form NOEC thus incorporates the standard for termination of the award \nspecified under the Terms and Conditions. Compare id., with December NOA at 43 (discussing \ntermination under the “programmatic conditions” header). \nE.  The Financial Agency Agreement Between Citibank and Treasury. \n \n59.  The July 2023 NOFO envisioned entering into a “financial agent arrangements with \nthe U.S. Department of Treasury” to “ensure that EPA’s interests are protected.” NOFO at 58. \nOFN had no role in EPA’s decision to include the financial agent concept in the July 2023 NOFO.  \n60.  The  Financial  Agent  concept  is  an  established  mechanism  for  disbursing \ngovernment funding that was first authorized in the 1860s and has been used for decades.7  \n61.  After a selection process run by Treasury, Citibank was selected as the Financial \nAgent. Citibank and Treasury entered into the FAA on September 19, 2024. \n62.  Like other CCIA and NCIF grantees, OFN is not a party to the FAA. Nor did OFN \nhave a role in selecting the financial agent. \n \n7 Revenue Collections And Payments: Treasury Has Used Financial Agents in Evolving Ways but \nCould  Improve  Transparency,  GAO-17-176  (Jan.  2017),  https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-\n176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions of \ndisbursing payments and collecting revenue.”). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 18 of 50\n \n63.  The financial agent arrangement provides EPA with full transparency into how \ngrant funds are being spent. EPA has full, real-time view access into all accounts of OFN. The \nfinancial agent arrangement also provides EPA with full visibility into any program income \ngenerated by OFN, which is typically opaque to EPA under alternative financial arrangements, \nincluding the Automated Standard Application for Payments (“ASAP”) system.8  \n64.  The FAA states that Citibank will provide “commercial banking and finance \nservices” “related to programs under the Inflation Reduction Act … including … grant programs” \nsuch as the CCIA. The FAA is not specific to OFN’s award and OFN is not mentioned in the FAA. \n65.  The FAA states that Citibank “owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty and fair dealing to \nthe United States when acting as a financial agent of the United States.” The FAA further provides \nthat as a financial agent, Citibank will “construe the terms of this FAA and any related instructions \nfrom Treasury in a reasonable manner” and commits “to act only within the scope of its actual \nauthority and to comply with all lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.”  \n66.  The FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts, and transfer funds in frozen \naccounts, at the direction of the relevant secured party [i.e., EPA],” but specifies that any such \naction must be “in accordance with the account control agreements.” Thus, nothing in the FAA \nauthorizes Citibank to freeze or transfer OFN’s award money absent a valid “Notice of Exclusive \nControl” under the ACA.  \n \n8 From August 2024 (when the August NOA was finalized) until November 2024 (when the ACA \nwas finalized), OFN’s grant was administered under the ASAP system. After that point, it was \nadministered under the FAA with Citibank. EPA has traditionally used the ASAP system to \ndisburse grant award funds. Under the ASAP system, Treasury does not conduct oversight—it \nsimply reports to EPA the amounts that have been drawn by the recipient and what amounts \nremain. See Revenue Collections and Payments: Treasury Has Used Financial Agents in Evolving \nWays  but  Could  Improve  Transparency,  GAO-17-176  (Jan.  2017), \nhttps://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-17-176.pdf (“Treasury has a long history of using financial agents \nto support its core functions of disbursing payments and collecting revenue.”).  \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 19 of 50\n \nF.  OFN Uses Grant Funds Provided by Citibank in the Normal Course. \n \n67.  OFN’s CCIA funds were fully obligated by EPA on August 8, 2024.  \n68.  OFN has drawn money from its Citibank accounts to pay operating expenses, as \npermitted by the governing Terms and Conditions (and underlying statutes and regulations), which \nrequires prior approval for drawing of transfers that will not be disbursed in the following fourteen \nbusiness days. See December NOA at 60-61.  \n69.  OFN has used grant funds for eligible payments to contractors hired consistent with \nfederal procurement rules, and part of the salaries and benefits for 42 employees on its payroll.  \n70.  OFN  plans  to  use  awards  to  finance  projects  to  benefit  under-resourced \ncommunities. Thus far, OFN has launched a pilot “Nascent Climate Lender Training” program to \nbuild its pipeline of qualified CDFI lenders, and it has already engaged in months-long trainings \nwith  36  lenders.  As  explained,  OFN  approved  awards  to  26  community  lenders.  The \nannouncement of over $228 million in initial awards to finance housing, distributed energy, and \ndevelop transportation infrastructure projects in more than 30 states, creating or retaining an \nestimated 5,000 jobs in communities across the United States, has been paused due to the illegal \nactions of the Defendants.   \n71.  Throughout  this  period,  EPA  has  continued  to  exercise  its  oversight  and \nsupervisory authority provided for under the grant award’s Terms and Conditions (and underlying \nstatutes and regulations).  \nG.  EPA Takes Actions to Suspend or Terminate OFN’s Grant, And to Cause \nCitibank to Withhold OFN’s Funds. \n \n72.  On January 30, 2025, Administrator Zeldin was sworn in as the EPA Administrator.  \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 20 of 50\n \n73.  On February 12, 2025, Administrator Zeldin made a public statement announcing \nEPA’s goal of taking possession of grant funds disbursed pursuant to the Inflation Reduction Act.9 \nWithout mentioning any specific basis for adverse action under the terms of OFN’s award—or that \nof any other recipient—Administrator Zeldin stated that “the financial agent agreement with the \nBank needs to be instantly terminated,” and stated that “the Bank must immediately return” the \ngrant funds.10 To ensure EPA “reassume[s] responsibility for all of these funds,” Administrator \nZeldin then stated that he would “refer[] this matter to the Inspector General’s Office and will \nwork with the Justice Department,” and that EPA is “not going to rest” until it has “recover[ed]” \nthe grant funds.11 \n74.  According to public news reporting, which EPA and DOJ have not disputed when \ngiven the opportunity in court, EPA thereafter took multiple actions designed to suspend or \nterminate OFN’s grant, and cause Citibank to withhold grant funds from OFN. Those actions \ninclude, but are not limited to: \na.  On February 17, 2025, the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (“ODAG”) at the \nDepartment of Justice communicated with the United States Attorney’s Office in \nWashington, D.C.

On February 17, 2025, FBI “recommended” that Citibank freeze assets in the \naccounts of OFN and every other prime recipient of a GGRF grant.14 In that letter, \nFBI did not refer to the FAA between Citibank and Treasury, or any obligations \nunder the FAA. FBI never produced a warrant issued by a judge who found \nprobable cause based on a sworn affidavit. FBI never articulated any exigent \ncircumstances to justify an immediate seizure of OFN’s assets without notice to \nOFN. FBI never identified any substantive factual basis for its “recommendation.” \nAnd FBI took this action even though Ms. Cheung advised that there was not \n“sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the \nparticular accounts identified.”15  \nc.  That same day, the ODAG instructed that a second letter be sent to Citibank \ndirecting that Citibank implement an asset freeze and refrain from releasing funds \nin the accounts of 28 other GGRF awardees and subawardees pursuant to a criminal \ninvestigation.16 In response, senior officials at the DC-USAO again asserted there \nwas not sufficient evidence to justify issuing that letter.17 Consistent with her oath \n \n13 Resignation Letter, supra note 13 (noting assessment that no “predicate for opening such a grand \njury investigation existed” on the face of the existing documents provided by ODAG).  \n14 See Exhibit 5 to Citibank’s TRO Opposition, Climate United Fund v.

Apparently without signoff from other prosecutors at the DC-USAO, Interim U.S. \nAttorney Ed Martin submitted a seizure warrant application with a magistrate \njudge, which was rejected.19 After that, ODAG reportedly sought a different U.S. \nattorney’s office to carry out the warrant request in order to launch a grand jury \ninvestigation and obtain a court-ordered bank freeze, but prosecutors in that office \nlikewise refused to do so.20 \ne.  On February 19, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated on X that he had “just read” a \n“grant agreement” related to the GGRF, characterizing it as “wild.”21  \nf.  On February 22, 2025, and at other times thereafter, Administrator Zeldin has stated \nthat he has cancelled several grant agreements, apparently unilaterally, regarding \nclimate and the environment.22  \n \n18 Id. \n19 Spencer Hsu, Maxine Joselow & Nicolas Rivero, FBI Takes Up EPA Probe Amid Pushback \nfrom Judge, Prosecutors, Wash.

On February 23, 2025, Administrator Zeldin discussed the GGRF program on \nnational television and stated, without basis, that “the entire scheme, in my opinion, \nis criminal.”23 \nh.  On March 2, 2025, EPA Deputy Administrator W.C. McIntosh sent a letter to \nEPA’s Office of the Inspector General asking for an OIG investigation into GGRF \nfunding.24 That letter, which was public, stated that Citibank was withholding the \nfunds “voluntarily.” The letter did not disclose FBI’s “recommendation” to freeze \nthe funds or EPA’s role in procuring that “recommendation.” \ni.  EPA  then  emailed  a  copy  of  that  letter  to  Citibank,  asserting  that  the  letter \n“highlights several of the egregious instances of misconduct regarding $20 billion \nGGRF distributions that have been improperly funneled through your financial \ninstitution,”  and  stating  that  “EPA  will  continue  our  efforts  to  re-establish \naccountability and oversight over the GGRF, which is riddled with self-dealing, \nconflicts of interest, extraordinarily unqualified recipients, improperly reduced \ngovernment oversight, and much more.”25 But the email to Citibank contained no \nactual factual basis for its assertions with respect to OFN (or any other CCIA or \nNCIF grantee).  \n \n23  Sunday  Morning  Futures  (@SundayMorningFutures),  X  (Feb.  23,  2025,  11:21  AM), \nhttps://x.com/SundayFutures/status/1893697750937505807;  see  also  Zack  Colman,  Recipient \nIsn’t Giving in as Trump’s EPA Tries to Revoke Climate Grants, Politico (Feb. 24, 2025), \nhttps://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/24/climate-grant-recipient-spending-trumps-epa-tries-\nclaw-back-00205814 (collecting quotes). \n24 EPA Formally Refers Financial Mismanagement of $20B “Gold Bars” to Inspector General, \nEPA  (last  updated  Mar.  3,  2025),  https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-formally-refers-\nfinancial-mismanagement-20b-gold-bars-inspector-general. \n25 Climate United, Dkt.

On March 4, 2025, the Department of Treasury directed Citibank not to disburse \nfunds from any of the GGRF accounts for a specified period. In an email to Citibank \nat 10:02 PM, Treasury stated that “Treasury is instructing Citibank, in its capacity \nas fiduciary, to work directly with the EPA to establish and implement reasonable \naccount  controls to  serve  the purposes  and interests of the United States,  in \naccordance with Section 5 of the FAA. Further, in order to provide the EPA with \nthe  necessary  time  to  develop  reasonable  account  controls,  we  are  further \ninstructing Citibank not to disburse funds from any of the GGRF accounts prior to \nthe end of the day Sunday, March 9, 2025.”26 \nk.  On March 4, 2025, Administrator Zeldin stated: “The money is now FROZEN and \nDOJ/FBI is investigating.”27  \nl.  On March 10, 2025, in an email to Citibank, EPA directed Citibank to continue to \nrefrain from processing payments. That message stated: “In its communication to \nthe Bank this week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) directed the \nBank to cooperate with EPA on account controls. To prevent the misuse of funds \nin the interim, EPA instructs the Bank, pursuant to this Treasury directive, the grant \nagreements, and Section I.B of Exhibit A to the [FAA], to pause the processing of \npayment instructions for the GGRF accounts until further notice.”28 \n \n26 Climate United, Dkt.

No. 14-2 (Exhibit 2 to Citibank’s opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for a \nTRO). \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 25 of 50\n \n75.  EPA  has  not  issued  a  Notice  of  Exclusive  Control—which  is  the  legal  tool \ndescribed in the ACA for restricting OFN’s access to these funds.  \n76.  Citibank  has  failed  to  comply  with  OFN’s  normal-course  requests  for \ndisbursements, as required by the ACA, and has failed to provide OFN with any valid legal basis \nfor its failure to act.  \na.  On February 26, 2025, OFN placed a request to Citibank to transfer CCIA funds \nbetween its Citibank accounts—in this instance, from its Technical Assistance \nServices Budget account to its Program Administration Activities Budget account. \nCitibank did not effectuate that transfer.  \nb.  On  February  28,  2025,  OFN  sent  an  email  to  Citibank  notifying  them  of  a \nforthcoming request to draw funds from OFN’s account and requesting a status \nupdate regarding the prior request to transfer funds between accounts. Again, \nCitibank did not effectuate the transfer.  \nc.  On March 3, 2025, OFN placed the request to Citibank to draw funds from its \naccount. In the normal course, Citibank would have sold shares in OFN’s money \nmarket account and then distributed the resulting funds to OFN later that same day. \nBut OFN’s account with Citibank does not reflect that the typical money market \ntransaction or disbursement occurred, and OFN did not receive any funds from its \naccount. That day, Citibank also informed OFN that the transfer had not been \nprocessed. Instead, Citibank instructed OFN to “continue to reach out to the EPA.”  \nd.  On March 4, 2025, in “a statement emailed to Newsweek…, a spokesperson for \nCitibank said Citi has been working with federal officials to ‘address government \nofficials’ concerns’ regarding the GGRF. ‘Our role as financial agent does not \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 26 of 50\n \ninvolve any discretion over which organizations receive grant funds,’ the bank said \nin its statement. ‘Citi will of course comply with any binding instructions from the \nfederal government.’”29  \ne.  To date, OFN has not received access to its CCIA grant funds.  \n77.  EPA failed to provide OFN with a reasoned explanation for its actions or a \nmeaningful opportunity to object or to be heard prior to the notice purporting to terminate its grant. \nEPA never informed OFN prior to attempting to terminate its grant that EPA had been trying to \nfreeze or suspend OFN’s grant or its access to grant funds, or that EPA had directed Citibank to \nstop disbursing funds to OFN.  \na.  On February 14, 2025, OFN sent a letter to Administrator Zeldin requesting a \nmeeting to discuss OFN’s work and its CCIA grant.  OFN was informed by the \nEPA Chief of Staff that the request had been sent to the Administrator’s schedulers \nfor calendaring. OFN followed up on its request on February 25, 2025. EPA did not \nrespond.  \nb.  On  March  11,  2025,  EPA  purported  to  terminate  OFN’s  CCIA  grant.  EPA \nsubmitted  a  purported  Notice  of  Termination  to  OFN  which  contained  no \ninformation specific to OFN’s performance under the grant agreement and was \nmaterially identical to the termination notices sent to every other CCIA and NCIF \ngrantee.   \nc.  On March 21, 2025, OFN attended a recurring bi-weekly meeting with EPA staff. \nEPA stated that it is not able to address the litigation or the termination status of the \n \n29 Jeff Young, Green Group Wants EPA to Explain Why $20 Billion Accounts Are Frozen, \nNewsweek  (Mar.  4,  2025),  https://www.newsweek.com/climate-united-fund-epa-letter-frozen-\nbank-accounts-2039608. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 27 of 50\n \ngrants. On March 24, after further inquiries from OFN, EPA stated that EPA “does \nexpect OFN to continue meeting the obligations under the Grant Agreement. We \nhave no information about accessibility of funds.”    \nd.  On March 28, 2025, OFN emailed Deputy Administrator McIntosh requesting a \nmeeting to discuss the grant award. Again, EPA did not respond. \ne.  On April 10, 2025, solely to preserve its rights and without conceding the validity \nof the EPA’s purported notice of termination, OFN emailed Deputy Administrator \nMcIntosh  and  their  Program  Officer  a  notice  challenging  and  appealing  any \npurported termination of their CCIA grant.  \nH.  EPA sends a Purported “Notice of Termination”  \n \n78.  On  March  11,  2025,  EPA  sent  OFN  a  purported  “Notice  of  Termination” \n(“Notice”). That Notice is materially identical to the notices that EPA sent to at least two other \nCCIA awardees that have already brought suit in this court in the CCIA Litigation.30 It is also \nmaterially identical to the notices EPA sent to the three NCIF recipients that are at issue in the \nNCIF Litigation.31 Like with the termination notices sent to other CCIA and NCIF grantees, the \nNotice provided no individualized reasoning as to anything OFN itself did—instead referencing \ngeneralized and unsubstantiated reasons for termination. See Climate United PI Decision at 28. \n79.  The Notice states that EPA is terminating OFN’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under 2 C.F.R. §[ ] 200.339.” Notice at 1. That regulation only applies when “the \n \n30 See Justice Climate Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-938 (filed Mar. 31, 2025); Inclusiv, Inc. \nv.

The Notice also states that EPA is terminating OFN’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under … 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.340.” Notice at 1. That regulation is the only termination \nauthority mentioned in EPA’s General Terms and Conditions for grants, permits termination “[b]y \nthe Federal agency … if the recipient … fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the \nFederal award” or “[b]y the Federal agency … pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal \naward.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA’s Notice does not offer any explanation as to how \nOFN has failed to comply with any Terms and Conditions of its grant, let alone any evidence that \nmight substantiate such an allegation.  \n81.  The Notice also states that EPA is terminating OFN’s award “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under … the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement.” Id. The Grant Agreement \nspecifies that termination may only occur if one of three conditions is met: (1) noncompliance with \nthe grant’s Terms and Conditions; (2) “adequate evidence of Waste, Fraud, or Abuse,” which in \nturn requires “credible evidence of the commission of a violation of Federal criminal law involving \nfraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title 18 of the united States Code \nor a violation of the civil False Claims Act”; and (3) “material misrepresentation of eligibility \nstatus.” December NOA at 43. EPA’s Notice does not say which of these conditions has been met, \nprovide any explanation as to how OFN has violated the terms or conditions of the grant, or offer \nany evidence to substantiate any allegation. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 29 of 50\n \n82.  The Notice also states that EPA is terminating OFN’s award “[p]ursuant to … the \nAgency’s inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new information.” Notice \nat 1. EPA’s Notice does not identify the source of such inherent authority or any new information \nto support reconsidering the prior determination to award the grant to OFN less than one year ago.  \n83.  The Notice also states that the “termination is based on substantial concerns \nregarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and \nmisalignment with the Agency’s priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals \nand statutory objectives of the award.” Id. EPA’s Notice does not identify any legal or factual basis \nfor terminating the grant on these grounds.  \n84.  The Notice also states that EPA has identified certain deficiencies, such as “the \nabsence of adequate oversight and account controls,” “allocation of funds inconsistent with EPA’s \noversight  and  fiscal  responsibilities,”  and  the  “circumvention  and  defeat  of  key  oversight \nmechanisms.” Id. EPA’s Notice does not substantiate these concerns or identify any legal or factual \nbasis for terminating the grant on these grounds.  \n85.  Finally, the Notice asserts that EPA has “determined that its existing process for \nawarding and overseeing execution of the Grant Agreement” may violate the “Appointments \nClause and private nondelegation doctrine.” Id. at 2. EPA’s Notice does not explain any legal or \nfactual basis for terminating the grant on these grounds. Indeed, neither the Appointments Clause \nnor the private nondelegation doctrine is implicated by this grant agreement.  \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 30 of 50\n \n86.  By press release dated March 11, 2025, EPA confirmed that it had “notified the \nNational Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator recipients of the \ntermination of their grant agreements.”32 \n87.  EPA has failed to substantiate the basis for its terminations of GGRF grant awards \ndespite repeated requests to do so, including from this Court. “[W]hen questioned at the March 12 \nhearing” in Climate United v. Citibank, No. 25-cv-698, EPA was unable to provide evidence to \njustify its termination, instead offering “circular” responses. Id. Dkt. 28 at 17. EPA was also \ndirected to submit a declaration “setting forth the basis for the termination” of GGRF grants, but \nthat  declaration  failed  to  justify  EPA’s  actions,  offering  only  “vague  and  unsubstantiated \nassertions” without evidence. Id. Dkt. 18 at 22. To date, EPA has not informed OFN that it did \nanything wrong. \nI.  EPA Modifies Its General Terms and Conditions to Add a New Ground for \nTermination, Then Rescinds Those Changes Days Later.  \n \n88.  On March 25, EPA updated its general terms and conditions to add “a new \ntermination provision if the award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  \n89.  That new termination provision purported to permit termination, with respect to \n“all new awards and funding amendments (incremental and supplemental) made on or after March \n25, 2025,” “[b]y the EPA or pass-through entity to the extent authorized by law, if an award no \nlonger effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  \n \n32 See Press Release, EPA, Administrator Zeldin Terminates Eiden-Harris $20B 'Gold Bar' Grants \n(Mar. 11, 2025), https:/www.epa.gov/newsre1eases/administrator-zeldin-tenninates-biden-harris-\n20b-gold-bar-grants. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 31 of 50\n \n90.  On Friday, March 28, 2025, EPA effectively rescinded its March 25, 2025, changes, \nreplacing the EPA General Terms and Conditions with the version that was effective prior to \nMarch 25, 2025.  \n91.  On Thursday, April 3, 2025, EPA again published changes to its general terms and \nconditions, again adding the language allowing it to terminate an award “to the extent authorized \nby law, if an award no longer effectuates the program goals or agency priorities.”  This revised \nversion,  however,  is  limited  to  “new  awards  and  funding  amendments  (incremental  and \nsupplemental) made on or after April 3, 2025.” \n92.  Neither the termination provision temporarily added in EPA’s March 25 revision \nnor the new termination provision in the April 3 revision is effective against OFN’s CCIA award, \nfor at least three reasons: (1) the exclusive grounds for termination are set forth in the Terms and \nConditions of the Grant Agreement, December NOA at 43; (2) EPA may not unilaterally modify \nthe Terms and Conditions of the Grant Agreement, id. at 54; and (3) the Grant Terms and \nConditions formally incorporate EPA’s General Terms and Conditions as they were on the \neffective date of the December NOA, which cannot be changed without OFN’s consent, see id. at \n54-55 (providing that “the EPA General Terms and Conditions effective October 1, 2024” “are \nincorporated by reference into the Award Agreement as of the effective date of this amended \nAward Agreement” and are “controlling … in the event [they] are … replaced”); see also id. at 55 \n(“This provision cannot be changed without the consent of the Recipient.”).  \nJ.  Citibank and EPA’s Actions Have Harmed OFN. \n \n93.  The CCIA award is currently the basis of funding for a significant share of OFN’s \noperations and for the initiatives that OFN is planning to launch. Even temporary inability to access \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 32 of 50\n \nits funding immediately threatens OFN’s operations, its ongoing and future projects, and its long-\nterm reputation. \n94.  OFN’s other funding sources are insufficient to replace the CCIA award. Nor is \nprivate investment a viable replacement. In fact, OFN was specifically awarded CCIA funding to \n“prioritize investment in qualified projects that would otherwise lack access to financing.” 42 \nU.S.C. § 7434(b)(1)(B). \n95.  Without access to its award funds, OFN is unable to fully carry out its mission and \nCCIA grant obligations, which are to deploy capital to vetted community lenders to fund green \nprojects that would not otherwise have been able to obtain financing through traditional channels.  \n96.  To  start,  Defendants’  actions  have  seriously  harmed  OFN’s  operations  and \nprograms. Most immediately, OFN cannot access funds necessary to pay its payroll and other \nexpenses related to the immediate implementation of its EPA-approved program workplan under \nOFN’s CCIA grant. More than half of OFN’s 81 staff members are supported by its CCIA grant. \nWithout access to its CCIA grant funding, OFN is unable to support these staff to carry out the \nobjectives of the CCIA program. As a result, OFN is in imminent danger of laying off staff to \nmanage the operating deficit that Defendants have caused.   \n97.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, OFN has also been forced to take significant \nsteps to reduce its operating costs. In particular, OFN has paused virtually all contract support \nwork.  This  reduction  has  undermined  many  of  OFN’s  core  operations,  including  ensuring \nregulatory and legal compliance and adherence to the terms of OFN’s CCIA grant agreement. \nThese disruptions have also forced OFN to shift resources and staff that would otherwise focus on \nnon-CCIA activities that drive revenue for OFN, compounding the harm.  \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 33 of 50\n \n98.  OFN has also made significant cuts to its own program implementation. For \nexample, OFN has paused its training initiative, the Nascent Climate Lender Training program. \nThis program advances OFN’s core mission by providing capacity building and expertise to \ncommunity lenders, including those who may receive future CCIA subawards. To establish this \nprogram, OFN reviewed over 100 applications, selected 36 community lenders to participate, and \ncommenced the program in 2025. As a result of Defendants’ actions, OFN has been forced to pause \nthe program, damaging OFN’s pipeline of community lenders, impeding its ability to carry out its \ncentral mission, and harming its reputation.  \n99.  Critically, prior to the wrongful disruption of its CCIA grant funding, OFN was \npoised to award over $228 million in subawards to 26 community lenders in a pilot funding round. \nWithout access to its CCIA funding, OFN will not be able to issue these 26 pending subawards. \nThese awards would support approximately 84 qualified projects across 21 states, including critical \nhousing and clean energy projects, that will not proceed unless OFN’s access to its funding is \nrestored. That not only harms OFN and potential subrecipients, but also the American people. \n100.  OFN has also experienced significant disruption to its ongoing efforts to fundraise \nadditional  private  capital  to  provide  senior  unsecured  balance  sheet  loans  to  its  selected \nsubrecipients. OFN expected to launch a new $200 million fund to support GGRF program goals \nrelated to private capital mobilization and anticipated closing $20 million in underlying loans for \nthis new fund on its own balance sheet in 2025. The interruption to OFN’s CCIA grant has \ninterfered with its ability to raise funds from investors and lenders for this fund, as well as its \nability to extend additional loans to its selected subrecipients.  As a result, OFN has reduced its \ndebt origination projections by $20 million for 2025, causing further harm to OFN in its ability to \ncarry out its mission. \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 34 of 50\n \n101.  Not only has OFN been unable to award over $228 million to entities it has selected \nto receive subawards, but it has also lost valuable investment opportunities, including a prospective \nsubrecipient that withdrew its application that was projected to support $125 million in housing \nand community facilities projects in rural America. The pause of OFN’s Nascent Climate Lender \nTraining Program has caused irreparable harm, and will continue to cause harm, to the confidence \nof members in OFN.  OFN asked its members to commit a significant amount of time and resources \nto develop their climate lending programs, and OFN was forced to pause the training prior to \ncompleting it and realizing the benefits. Further, the inconsistency of information from the EPA \nregarding the status of the OFN grant has prevented OFN from being able to communicate \nconsistently with its members, causing reputational harm. The program instability is causing and \nwill continue to cause a loss of confidence among OFN members regarding OFN’s ability to \nmanage programs. It will also decrease programmatic impact and reduce program participation. It \nalso  threatens OFN’s  recovery of the remaining participant support costs, which will have \nadditional budgetary implications for OFN. \n102.  OFN’s resulting inability to honor its commitments to its members, prospective \nsubrecipients, contractors, and investors will erode trust in OFN as an institution, damage its \nreputation, and cause profound harm to the organizations that rely on OFN funds to develop critical \nprojects that reduce energy costs, create jobs, and strengthen communities.   \n103.  OFN’s success depends on its reputation, including with investors and members. \nThat trust has been built over a 40-year period through careful management of private and federal \nfunds and diligent work building and sustaining relationships. Defendants’ actions have damaged \nOFN’s reputation and the relationships it has worked to build. OFN has been forced to notify its \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 35 of 50\n \ninvestors and partners of these events. Defendants’ actions have continued to impede OFN’s ability \nto fundraise for both debt and grant investors moving forward. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCOUNT ONE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \nARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n104.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n105.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n106.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate OFN’s grant by delivering a \n“Notice of Termination.”  \n107.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant constitutes final agency action under the APA. \n108.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant is arbitrary and capricious because EPA had no \nlegal or factual basis for the termination and EPA did not provide an adequate or reasoned basis \nfor the termination. \na.  The Notice states that EPA is terminating OFN’s grant “[p]ursuant to [EPA’s] \nauthority under 2 C.F.R. 200.339-340, the General Terms and Conditions of EPA \nassistance award agreements, the terms and conditions of the Grant Agreement, and \nthe Agency’s inherent authority to reconsider prior determinations in light of new \ninformation.” But EPA’s Notice does not offer any evidence or explanation to \nsupport termination on those grounds. Indeed, there is no legal or factual basis for \ntermination on any of those grounds. OFN has not violated any constitutional \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 36 of 50\n \nprovision, statute, or regulation; has not failed to comply with any Terms or \nConditions of its grant; has not failed to comply with any General Terms and \nConditions of EPA assistance award agreements; has not engaged in “Waste, Fraud, \nor Abuse,\" which is defined as “the commission of a violation of Federal criminal \nlaw involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery, or gratuity violations found in Title \n18 of the United States Code or a violation of the civil False Claims Act”; and has \nnot triggered any of the grounds for termination under the Terms and Conditions of \nits grant. \nb.  EPA’s Notice does not identify the source of any inherent authority to terminate \nthe grant; does not identify any new information to support reconsidering the prior \ndetermination to award the grant to OFN less than one year ago; does not identify \nany basis to terminate the grant based on concerns about program integrity, the \naward, process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, misalignment with the \nAgency’s priorities, or sufficiency of oversight mechanisms or account controls; \nand does not explain any legal or factual basis for terminating the grant based on \nthe Appointments Clause or the private nondelegation doctrine.  \nc.  EPA’s termination reflects an arbitrary and capricious change in position. EPA has \nprovided no reasoned explanation for its decision to terminate OFN’s grant on \nMarch 11, 2025, when the grant was awarded in April 2024, following months of \nrigorous review as part of a competitive application process. \nd.  EPA’s Notice did not provide a theory underlying the termination. To the contrary, \nthe termination notice was sent just seven days after EPA requested information so \nthat EPA could evaluate the GGRF program’s oversight controls, and gave OFN \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 37 of 50\n \nand other grantees until March 28, 2025 to respond. It is therefore unclear what \nrelevant data EPA considered within such a short period that called for the sudden \ntermination of the grants.  \ne.  EPA’s  Notice  provides  no  explanation  for  its  abrupt  change  of  position  that \naccounts for upsetting the reliance interests of OFN and its subgrantees.  \n109.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n110.  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2201,  OFN  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  EPA’s \ntermination is arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA.  \nCOUNT TWO: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \nNOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH FEDERAL REGULATIONS \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n111.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n112.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n113.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate OFN’s grant by delivering a \nNotice of Termination.  \n114.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n115.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant is not in accordance with law because it violates \nmultiple federal regulations. For example:  \na.  EPA’s  termination  of  the  grant  violates  EPA regulations  and  Uniform  Grant \nGuidance regulations codified at 2 C.F.R. § 200 et seq., which do not allow EPA to \nterminate OFN’s grant under these circumstances. \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 38 of 50\n \nb.  EPA’s termination of the grant has not complied with EPA’s regulatory obligation \nto take certain procedural steps to terminate the grant agreement, such as providing \nwritten  notice  of  termination  that  includes  “the  reasons  for  termination,  the \neffective date, and the portion of the Federal award to be terminated, if applicable.” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.341(a). The Notice only provides vague references to “waste” and \n“accountability,” among other things, with no supporting evidence or facts as to \nwhat OFN is alleged to have done wrong.  \nc.  EPA’s termination of the grant has resulted in improperly withholding payment for \nallowable costs without establishing that OFN has either “failed to comply with the \nterms and conditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United \nStates.” 2 C.F.R. § 200.305(b)(6).  \nd.  EPA’s termination of the grant has resulted in improperly withholding payment \nwithout first making a “determin[ation] that noncompliance cannot be remedied by \nimposing specific conditions.” 2 C.F.R. § 300.339. Although the Notice includes a \nvague reference to “material deficiencies” and asserts “these deficiencies … cannot \nbe  remedied  by  imposing  specific  conditions,”  EPA  does  not  explain  these \nstatements or offer facts to support them.  \ne.  EPA’s termination of the grant does not comply with 2 C.F.R. § 200.340(b), which \nstates: “The Federal agency or pass-through entity must clearly and unambiguously \nspecify all termination provisions in the terms and conditions of the Federal award.” \nEPA’s termination decision is not grounded in the “terms and conditions of the \nFederal award.” Instead, the termination is based on EPA’s disagreement with the \nGGRF program.  \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 39 of 50\n \n116.  Although EPA’s Notice states that EPA is terminating OFN’s grant “[p]ursuant to \n[EPA’s] authority under 2 C.F.R. §§ 200.339-40,” those regulations do not provide EPA with \ngrounds to terminate the grant.  \na.  2 C.F.R. § 200.339 applies only when “the recipient … fails to comply with the \nU.S. Constitution, Federal statutes, regulations, or terms and conditions of the \nFederal award.” EPA has not provided any reasoned legal or factual basis to \nconclude the OFN has violated any constitutional provision, statute, regulation, or \nterm or condition of the grant. Indeed, OFN has not violated any constitutional \nprovision, statute, regulation, or term or condition of the grant.  \nb.  2 C.F.R. § 200.340 permits termination “[b]y the Federal agency … if the recipient \n… fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the Federal award” or “[b]y the \nFederal agency … pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Federal award ….” \n2 C.F.R. § 200.340(a)(1) and (4). EPA has not provided any reasoned legal or \nfactual basis to conclude that OFN has failed to comply with any Terms and \nConditions of its grant.  \n117.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action.  \n118.  Pursuant to 28 U.S. § 2201, OFN is entitled to a declaration that EPA’s termination \nof the grant is not in accordance with federal regulations, in violation of the APA. \nCOUNT THREE: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \nNOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT \n(CHALLENGE TO TERMINATION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n119.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 40 of 50\n \n120.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n121.  On March 11, 2025, EPA purported to terminate OFN’s grant by delivering a \nNotice of Termination.  \n122.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n123.  EPA’s termination of OFN’s grant is not in accordance with law because it violates \nthe Inflation Reduction Act. The Act requires EPA to spend the funds appropriated for grants to \nbe awarded under the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, 42 U.S.C. § 7434. EPA violated the Act \nbecause it has not satisfied the stringent requirements for rescinding an appropriation under 2 \nU.S.C. § 683.  \n124.  Even  if  EPA  “re-obligate[s]  lawfully  appropriated  funds  within  the  GGRF \nprogram,” Climate United, Dkt. 13-1, EPA’s action would still be illegal. The Inflation Reduction \nAct sets a September 30, 2024 deadline for all grants to be awarded. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1), (2). \nIllegally terminating the entire CCIA program, and then re-awarding grants to unspecified new \nrecipients, is inconsistent with that September 30, 2024 deadline.  \n125.  In addition, when Congress established the GGRF program, it laid out specific \ndirectives—not mere suggestions—as to what EPA could do with the money, and it provided \nspecific deadlines and specific requirements for eligible recipients. Agencies are “not free simply \nto disregard statutory responsibilities.” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993). But that is what \nEPA would be doing if it were to re-obligate GGRF funds that were lawfully awarded. \n126.  As a result of EPA’s conduct, OFN has suffered and will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury.  \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 41 of 50\n \n127.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n128.  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2201,  OFN  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  EPA’s \ntermination of the grant is not in accordance with the Inflation Reduction Act, in violation of the \nAPA.  \nCOUNT FOUR: VIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT \nNOT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT \n(CHALLENGE TO SUSPENSION) \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n129.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n130.  The APA authorizes this Court to hold unlawful and set aside final agency action \nthat is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n131.  Prior to March 11, 2025, EPA effectuated a suspension of OFN’s grant by causing \nCitibank to withhold OFN’s grant funds. \n132.  EPA’s suspension of OFN’s grant constitutes final agency action under the APA.  \n133.  EPA’s suspension of OFN’s grant is not in accordance with federal regulations, as \ndescribed above. For example, EPA’s actions resulted in improperly withholding payment for \nallowable costs without establishing that OFN had either “failed to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the Federal award” or is “delinquent in a debt to the United States.” 2 C.F.R. § \n200.305(b)(6).  \n134.  EPA’s suspension of OFN’s grant is arbitrary and capricious. \na.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to open a grand jury investigation into OFN’s \ngrant. Indeed, EPA’s efforts to do so caused the Chief of the Criminal Division of \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 42 of 50\n \nthe United States Attorneys’ Office in Washington, D.C. to resign from that office \nafter 24 years of service.  \nb.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to cause a Freeze Letter to be issued to Citibank, \nor to cause Citibank or Treasury to freeze OFN’s grant funds, particularly when the \nfreeze “recommendation” was not supported by an order issued by a judge based \non probable cause and cited no evidence. \nc.  EPA had no legal or factual basis to direct Treasury to demand that Citibank stop \ndisbursing funds. Further, Treasury’s action did not comply with the FAA, which \nstates that any freeze of OFN’s accounts must occur in accordance with the ACA \nand must be lawful.  \nd.  EPA refused to meet with OFN, and never substantively responded to OFN’s \ncommunications about its inability to access its funds—even while EPA was \nsimultaneously acting to prevent OFN from accessing its grant funds.  \n135.  OFN continues to experience ongoing injury from the suspension because during \nthe suspension period it has not received funds to which it is legally entitled. Further, even if the \ntermination is enjoined, any suspension that remains in effect would cause harm to OFN.  \n136.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n137.  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2201,  OFN  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  EPA’s \nsuspension of the grant is arbitrary, capricious, and not in accordance with law, in violation of the \nAPA.  \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 43 of 50\n \nCOUNT FIVE: VIOLATION OF THE APPROPRIATIONS CLAUSE AND \nSEPARATION OF POWERS \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n138.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n139.  The Appropriations Clause provides: “No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, \nbut in consequence of Appropriations made by Law.” U.S. Const. art. I, § 9, cl. 7.  \n140.  The  provision  of  the  Inflation  Reduction  Act  authorizing  the  GGRF  is  an \n“appropriation” because it authorizes EPA to expend $27 billion for purposes of carrying out the \nGGRF program.  \n141.  In the Inflation Reduction Act, Congress “appropriated to the [EPA] Administrator \n… $8,000,000,000, to remain available until September 30, 2024, to make grants, on a competitive \nbasis.” 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(3). The Appropriations Clause therefore forbids EPA From using \nappropriated funds to award grants after the statutory deadline.  \n142.  In the “Notice of Termination,” EPA states: “EPA will work to re-obligate lawfully \nappropriated funds within the GGRF program …” Notice at 2. In doing so, EPA seeks to spend \nmoney in a manner Congress has not permitted, in violation of the Appropriations Clause.  \n143.  If EPA re-obligates GGRF’s award funds to its preferred recipients, EPA would be \nviolating Congress’ intention for the funds to be obligated to clean-energy grants that were \ncompleted prior to September 30, 2024. By terminating all grants and re-obligating all the funds, \nEPA would be effecting a new grant-awarding program in 2025—after the September 30, 2024 \ndeadline for GGRF awards has passed. 42 U.S.C. § 7434(a)(1)-(3).  \n144.  Moreover,  “Congress  sets  the  policy,  not  the  [Administrator],”  and  “policy \ndisagreements” with Congress’s decision to fund these clean energy projects “is not a lawful \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 44 of 50\n \nground  for  the  Administrator  to  decline  to  continue  the  congressionally  mandated”  GGRF \nprogram. See In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 260 (D.C. Cir. 2013). “Congress speaks through the \nlaws it enacts” and here, EPA has terminated programs established through lawfully enacted \ncongressional appropriations without any basis in statutory authority. Id. EPA cannot shut down \nthese programs completely and it cannot “decline to spend previously appropriated funds.” Id. \n145.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 327 (2015).33  \n146.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against EPA’s wrongful action. \n147.  Pursuant  to  28  U.S.C.  §  2201,  OFN  is  entitled  to  a  declaration  that  EPA’s \nsuspension and termination of the grant violate the Appropriations Clause.  \nCOUNT SIX: VIOLATION OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE \n(Defendants EPA, Administrator Zeldin) \n \n148.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n149.  Under the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the government may \nnot deprive a person or entity of a protected property interest without due process of law.  \n150.  OFN has a protected property interest in its award funds under the CCIA and in the \naccounts at Citibank to which those funds were disbursed.  \n151.  The government’s actions preceding the termination, up to and including the \ntermination, violated the Due Process Clause. For example: \n \n33 The APA independently authorizes OFN to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 45 of 50\n \na.  EPA caused Citibank to freeze OFN’s assets without first obtaining a court order \nbased on probable cause and supported by a sworn affidavit. Indeed, EPA Initiated \nthe freeze despite a judge having expressly rejected an application for a seizure \nwarrant on the basis that no probable cause existed.  \nb.  EPA never informed OFN that EPA was trying to freeze, suspend, or terminate \nOFN’s grant award or its access to award funds, or that EPA was coordinating in \nsecret with Treasury and FBI to direct Citibank to stop disbursing funds to OFN. \nEPA thus deprived OFN of its property in its award funds without providing OFN \nnotice or an opportunity be heard prior to the initiation of the freeze.  \nc.  EPA also failed to provide OFN notice or an opportunity to challenge the freeze \nonce it had been implemented. After OFN deduced that its funds had been frozen, \nEPA refused to respond to OFN’s requests to provide an explanation and never \nnotified OFN that its funds had been frozen at EPA’s direction. At the same time—\nand again without providing OFN notice of its actions—EPA was continuing to \npressure Citibank to  keep OFN from  accessing its funds in  its  accounts and \nultimately directed Treasury to order Citibank to withhold OFN’s funds.  \nd.  In an attempt to extend the unlawful freeze of OFN’s assets, EPA issued the “Notice \nof Termination” without any legal or factual basis. It offered no notice or process \nto OFN before doing so; and the Notice provides no opportunity for OFN to \nchallenge the purported “termination” of its award funds after the fact.  \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 46 of 50\n \n152.  Federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with respect \nto violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr, Inc., 575 \nU.S. 320, 327 (2015).34 \nCOUNT SEVEN: BREACH OF CONTRACT \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n153.  OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n154.  Citibank has a duty under the ACA to disburse OFN’s award funds to OFN, as OFN \nrequests.  Under  the  ACA,  Citibank  “shall  comply  with  all  instructions,  notification,  and \nentitlement orders the Bank receives directing the disposition of funds and financial assets in the \nAccounts,” including instructions from “the Pledgor”—i.e., OFN. ACA § 2.  \n155.  When OFN requested that Citibank disburse award funds held in OFN’s accounts \nin accordance with the ACA, Citibank failed to disburse such funds.  \n156.  Citibank has no legal or factual basis for failing to disburse award funds from \nOFC’s accounts, as required by the ACA. \n157.  Under the ACA, Citibank’s duties with  respect to  OFN’s  award funding are \nexclusively “administrative or ministerial (and shall not be construed as fiduciary in nature),” and \nCitibank “shall not be responsible” for determining whether OFN’s requests for the disbursement \nof award funds comply with any applicable contracts or laws. ACA at 3. \n158.  The only condition under which Citibank is allowed to refuse OFN’s request to \ndisburse funds is if EPA has delivered a “Notice of Exclusive Control.” EPA has not delivered \nsuch a Notice of Exclusive Control to Citibank. \n \n34 The APA independently authorizes OFN to bring this claim. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 47 of 50\n \n159.  The FAA between Citibank and Treasury, to which OFN is not a party, does not \nprovide Citibank with a legal basis to fail to disburse OFN’s award funds as required by the ACA. \nThe FAA authorizes Citibank to “freeze accounts” only “in accordance with” the ACA and in \ncompliance with “lawful instructions or directions received from Treasury.” But Citibank froze \nOFN’s funds without following the ACA’s termination provisions and based on instructions that \nwere not lawful.  \n160.  By failing to disburse award funds held in OFN’s accounts, Citibank has breached \nthe ACA. \n161.  Citibank’s failure to disburse funds, as required under the ACA, has caused damage \nto OFN.  \n162.  OFN understands the predicament that EPA Placed Citibank in by instructing \nCitibank not to disburse funds to which OFN is lawfully entitled under the plain terms of the ACA. \nEven if its breach was understandable, Citibank plainly violated the clear terms of the ACA by \nrefusing to honor OFN’s request to disburse award funds to which it was lawfully entitled.  \n163.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201, OFN is entitled to a declaration that Citibank’s failure \nto disburse funds from OFN’s accounts is a breach of the ACA. \n164.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful refusal to honor OFN’s \ndisbursement requests.  \nCOUNT EIGHT: REPLEVIN \n(Defendant Citibank) \n \n165.

OFN  repeats  and  incorporates  herein  by  reference  each  and  every  allegation \ncontained in the preceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.  \n170.  OFN has a legal right to possess and control the grant funds held in its accounts at \nCitibank, pursuant to the ACA. \n171.  Citibank has wrongfully and intentionally exercised dominion or control over the \ngrant funds in OFN’s accounts, including by failing to disburse grant funds to OFN from OFN’s \naccounts in response to OFN’s valid and proper requests. \n172.  Citibank has intentionally permanently or substantially interfered with OFN’s \nproperty rights, including by failing to disburse grant funds to OFN from OFN’s accounts in \nresponse to OFN’s valid and proper requests. \n173.  Citibank  has  acted  without  OFN’s  consent  and  has  no  legal  abasis  or  valid \njustification for its actions.  \n174.  Citibank’s intentional actions have caused damage to OFN. \n175.  OFN is entitled to an injunction against Citibank’s wrongful retention of OFN’s \nfunds.  \n176.  Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 2201, OFN is entitled to a declaration that Citibank’s failure \nto disburse funds from OFN’s accounts constitutes a conversion of OFN’s funds.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, OFN respectfully asks this Court: \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 49 of 50\n \n1.  Declare that EPA’s purported “Notice of Termination” is null, void, and of no legal \neffect; \n2.  Declare that EPA and Administrator Zeldin’s suspension and termination of the \ngrant violates the Administrative Procedure Act because they are arbitrary and \ncapricious, not in accordance with federal regulations, and not in accordance with \nfederal statutes; \n3.  Declare that EPA and Administrator Zeldin’s actions violate the Appropriations \nClause and Separation of Powers; \n4.  Declare that EPA and Administrator Zeldin’s actions violate the Due Process \nClause; \n5.  Enjoin EPA, Administrator Zeldin, and others in active concert or participation \ntherewith, including officials at Treasury, from impeding Citibank from complying \nwith its contractual obligations, or otherwise causing Citibank to deny, obstruct, \ndelay, or otherwise prevent OFN from accessing its funds as permitted under the \nterms of the ACA and the grant award;  \n6.  Enjoin EPA and Administrator Zeldin from unlawfully suspending or terminating \nOFN’s grant award except as permitted in accordance with the ACA, the grant \naward, and applicable law; \n7.  Declare that Citibank’s failure to disburse grant funds from OFN’s accounts is a \nbreach of the ACA; \n8.  Order Citibank to process, disburse, and release all funds in accounts established in \nconnection with OFN’s grant, at OFN’s request, in accordance with the ACA, both \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208     Document 1     Filed 04/21/25     Page 50 of 50\n \nwith respect to requests OFN has already submitted and with respect to future \nrequests; \n9.

Broad Street Suite 1930   \nPhiladelphia, PA 19109   \n   \nPlaintiff,   \n   \nv.   \n   \nCITIBANK, N.A.,   \n5800 South Corporate Place  No. 25-cv-1208-TSC \nSioux Falls, South Dakota 57108,   \n   \nand    \n \nUNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL \nPROTECTION AGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460, \n \nand  \n \nLEE ZELDIN, in his official capacity as \nADMINISTRATOR, UNITED STATES \nENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION \nAGENCY \n1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20460 \n \nDefendants. \n \n \nJOINT MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE AND  \nSTIPULATION REGARDING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nPursuant  to  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  42(a)(2),  Plaintiff  Opportunity  Finance \nNetwork (“OFN”) and Defendants U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Lee Zeldin, in his \nofficial capacity as Administrator of EPA (together, “EPA”), and Defendant Citibank, N.A. \n(“Citibank,” and together with OFN and EPA, the “Parties”) jointly move to consolidate this case \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208-TSC     Document 14     Filed 05/09/25     Page 2 of 5\nwith materially similar cases that raise common questions of law and fact that are consolidated \nunder Climate United Fund v. Citibank et. al., No. 1:25-cv-00698-TSC (“GGRF Litigation”). \nAdditionally, the Parties ask the Court to approve the Parties’ stipulation regarding the preliminary \ninjunction entered in the GGRF Litigation. \n1.  Plaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation received grants from EPA under 42 U.S.C. § \n7434, as part of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund (“GGRF”) created by Congress. Those grants, \nunder  the  National  Clean  Investment  Fund  (“NCIF”)  and  Clean  Communities  Investment \nAccelerator fund (“CCIA”), were issued at similar times utilizing similar grant agreements with \ncommon terms. Those grants use a designated financial agent (Citibank) to hold the grant funds \nawarded to the plaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation and to administer program distributions.  \n2.  In February and March 2025, EPA effectuated a freeze on the grant funds of the \nplaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation. EPA then sent materially identical notices to terminate those \nplaintiffs’ grants at similar times upon similar bases. In response, those plaintiffs sued EPA and \nCitibank asserting similar claims under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Inflation \nReduction Act, applicable regulations, and the Appropriations and Due Process clauses of the U.S. \nConstitution. \n3.  Recognizing that the claims advanced by the CCIA grantees and the NCIF grantees \nraised common factual and legal questions, including whether EPA’s termination was lawful and \nwhether the Court had jurisdiction to adjudicate plaintiffs’ claims, the Court consolidated the cases \nbrought by the CCIA and NCIF grantees. See Climate United Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-\n698, at Minute Orders entered March 20 (consolidating cases brought by NCIF grantees), March \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208-TSC     Document 14     Filed 05/09/25     Page 3 of 5\n25 (consolidated case brought by NCIF subgrantees), April 15 (consolidating cases brought by \nCCIA grantees).1  \n4.  OFN’s claims and the factual allegations underlying them are substantially similar \nto the claims in the consolidated GGRF Litigation. OFN received a grant from EPA under the \nGGRF, as part of the CCIA program, like certain of the plaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation. OFN’s \ngrant is subject to the same constitutional, statutory, and regulatory provisions as the grants at issue \nin the GGRF Litigation. OFN’s grant agreement and the grant agreements at issue in the GGRF \nLitigation feature common terms and conditions. OFN’s grant, like the grants at issue in the GGRF \nLitigation, use Citibank as the designated financial agent to hold each respective grantee’s grant \nfunds and to administer program distributions. EPA sent OFN a notice to terminate OFN’s grant \nthat is materially identical to the notice EPA sent to plaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation. OFN has \nsued EPA and Citibank asserting claims that are materially identical to the claims asserted by the \nPlaintiffs in the GGRF Litigation. \n5.  This Court has issued a preliminary injunction in the GGRF Litigation. Climate \nUnited Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-698, ECF No. 89 at 10-11. The “preliminary injunction \ncovers  all  Plaintiffs”  in  the  consolidated  GGRF  Litigation,  including  NCIF  grantees  and \nsubgrantees, and CCIA grantees. \n6.  OFN represents that, for many of the same reasons described by the NCIF and \nCCIA grantees and discussed in the Court’s preliminary injunction decision, see id. at 32-36, OFN \n \n1 The cases consolidated with Climate United Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-698-TSC (filed \nMar. 8, 2025) include: Coalition for Green Capital v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-735-TSC (filed \nMar. 12, 2025); Power Forward Communities, Inc. v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-762-TSC (filed \nMar. 14, 2025); California Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank v. Citibank, NA., No. \n25-cv-820 (filed March 19, 2025); Justice Climate Fund v. Citibank, NA., No. 25-cv-938 (filed \nMar. 31, 2025) and Inclusiv, Inc. v. EPA, No. 25-cv-948 (filed Mar. 31, 2025). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208-TSC     Document 14     Filed 05/09/25     Page 4 of 5\nwill  suffer  irreparable  harm  without  release  of  its  grant  funds  and  without  a  preliminary \ninjunction.2 EPA contends that preliminary injunctive relief for OFN is not warranted for the \nreasons set forth in EPA’s oppositions to the NCIF grantees’ and subgrantees’ motions for a \npreliminary injunction. ECF Nos. 49 and 56. Citibank contends that there is no likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits against Citibank for the reasons set out in ECF No. 48.   \n7. Because this Court has entered a preliminary injunction in the GGRF Litigation,\nthe Parties agree that litigating a motion for preliminary injunction by OFN would be duplicative \nand would not represent an efficient use of the Court’s or the Parties’ resources.  \n8. The Court’s preliminary injunction in the GGRF Litigation has been appealed to\nthe United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. No. 25-5122. The D.C. \nCircuit administratively stayed the preliminary injunction on April 16, 2025, Document #2111459, \nand extended that stay pending further order of the circuit court on April 28, 2025, Document \n#2113330. Briefing is ongoing and the D.C. Circuit has set oral argument for May 19, 2025. \n9. The Parties stipulate as follows:\n• EPA and Citibank will apply the preliminary injunction entered in the GGRF\nLitigation, as modified by the D.C. Circuit’s administrative stay, to OFN;\n• Any decision by the D.C. Circuit in No. 25-5122 on the appeal of the preliminary\ninjunction entered in the GGRF Litigation will apply to OFN as it does to the current\nGGRF Litigation plaintiffs;\n• OFN will not file a brief or appear at argument in the D.C. Circuit in No. 25-5122.\n2 If the Court deems it necessary, OFN is prepared to file  a declaration with evidence to \nsubstantiate that it will suffer irreparable harm without release of its grant funds and without a \npreliminary injunction. \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01208-TSC     Document 14     Filed 05/09/25     Page 5 of 5\n10. For these reasons, and to avoid unnecessary litigation, the Parties respectfully move\nthe Court to enter the attached proposed order to (1) consolidate OFN’s case with the consolidated \nGGRF Litigation, (2) approve the Parties’ stipulation.  \nDated: May 9, 2025  Respectfully submitted \n/s/ David B.
