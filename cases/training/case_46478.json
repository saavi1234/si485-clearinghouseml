    "summary": "<p>This case challenges President Trump&rsquo;s imposition of tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On April 22, 2025, two educational toy manufacturers&mdash;Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.&mdash;filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump and key federal government officials from various departments. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, arguing that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose import tariffs, and that doing so violates the constitutional principle of separation of powers.</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Rudolph Contreras.</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs challenged multiple executive orders issued under IEEPA, which imposed tariffs on a wide range of imports, including products from China. They argued the President lacked statutory authority and that the implementing agencies violated the APA. On April 24, the defendants moved to transfer the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), arguing it had exclusive jurisdiction over tariff-related challenges. The plaintiffs opposed this transfer, arguing that IEEPA itself does not explicitly provide for tariffs, and thus the case belongs in federal district court under general federal question jurisdiction. Plaintiffs simultaneously moved for a preliminary injunction.</p>\r\n<p>On May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras denied the motion to transfer and granted the preliminary injunction, ruling that IEEPA does not authorize the President to unilaterally impose tariffs. &nbsp;2025 WL 1525376. The government appealed, and sought a stay pending that appeal from both the district court and the court of appeals. It also sought expedited briefing in the court of appeals.</p>\r\n<p>On June 3, 2025, the district court granted the government&rsquo;s motion to further stay the injunction pending resolution of the appeal. The government then withdrew its parallel request for a stay from the D.C. Circuit as moot.</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, 2025, plaintiffs filed a petition for writ of certiorari before judgment in the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking direct review of the constitutional question. The petition argued that the case presented an issue of exceptional national importance and requested expedited briefing. On June 20, the Court denied the request for expedited treatment but did not rule on the petition itself, giving the government until July 22 to file a response.</p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the D.C. Circuit granted the government&rsquo;s motion to expedite the appeal on June 18. The government filed its opening brief on July 2, 2025, defending the President&rsquo;s inherent authority to act in international economic matters during a national emergency. It argued that IEEPA&rsquo;s broad language permitted the imposition of restrictions on imports, including tariffs, and that Congress had historically acquiesced to such uses. Plaintiffs filed their response on July 17, maintaining that tariffs were not &ldquo;regulations&rdquo; or &ldquo;transactions&rdquo; within IEEPA&rsquo;s meaning and that tariff authority was exclusively reserved to Congress under Article I, Section 8. They also emphasized that the Supreme Court had narrowly construed IEEPA in past cases and that Trump&rsquo;s actions marked an unprecedented expansion of executive power. A reply brief was scheduled for late July, with oral argument anticipated in fall 2025.</p>\r\n<p>As of July 2025, both the D.C. Circuit appeal and the Supreme Court certiorari petition remained pending.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case challenged President Trump’s tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). On April 22, 2025, two toy companies, Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against President Trump and top federal officials. They argued that IEEPA did not allow the President to impose import tariffs and that doing so violates the Constitution’s separation of powers. The case was assigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras.\r\n\r\nThe companies challenged several executive orders that imposed tariffs on many imports, including products from China. They said the President did not have the legal authority and that the agencies enforcing the tariffs broke the law under the Administrative Procedure Act. On April 24, the government asked to move the case to the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT), saying it had the sole power to hear tariff cases. The plaintiffs opposed the transfer and asked the court for a preliminary injunction to stop the tariffs while the case went forward.\r\n\r\nOn May 29, 2025, Judge Contreras denied the transfer and granted the injunction, ruling that IEEPA does not give the President the power to impose tariffs. The government appealed and asked for a stay, which the court partially granted on June 3.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs then asked the Supreme Court to review the case directly, saying it raised a very important national issue. The D.C. Circuit Court moved the appeal along quickly, with both sides filing briefs in July. The plaintiffs argued that tariffs are not covered by IEEPA and that only Congress can approve them. The government argued that the President acted within the law to protect the country’s economic interests.\r\n\r\nOn September 9, 2025, the Supreme Court combined this case with V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump and agreed to hear it. Oral argument was scheduled for November 5, 2025. The D.C. Circuit appeal was still undecided.\r\n\r\nThe case is ongoing.",

Plaintiffs are entitled to a preliminary injunction to stop any further \nirreparable damage before it is too late. \nThe critical question in this case is whether Congress intended to authorize the President \nto impose tariffs—or, as our Constitution says, the “[p]ower [t]o lay and collect Taxes, Duties, \nImposts,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1—when it authorized him to “regulate” importation. The \nanswer is no. The power to regulate and the power to tax have long been understood as distinct \npowers, “not *** similar in their terms or their nature.” Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat) 1, \n198-199 (1824). That understanding persisted at the time of IEEPA’s enactment, with the former \ncontemporaneously defined as concerned with rules and the latter with raising revenue. It is thus \nno surprise that the government is unable to point to any other statute where the term “regulate” \nhas been understood to include the power to tax. Nor can the government point to any other \nPresident that has understood IEEPA to grant the power to impose tariffs—even this President in \nhis first term. Courts require a sturdier reed on which to rest unheralded powers of such grave \neconomic and political consequence. \nGiven its thin textual justification, the government leans heavily on Yoshida, a single 50-\nyear-old panel decision from the predecessor to the Federal Circuit involving a different statute. \nBut there is nothing settled about that non-binding decision, which reversed a three-judge court \nconcluding that the President lacked statutory power to impose tariffs. Nor is the appellate decision \npersuasive on its own terms. Yoshida’s purposive approach, in conflict with the Supreme Court’s \nmodern text-based doctrines, reasoned that the President must have adequate tools to deal with a \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 9 of 33\nnational emergency. What it failed to appreciate was that Congress placed limits on what the \nPresident’s toolbox contains.  \nThe government’s plea for deference is misplaced. This case rises and falls on a judicial \ndetermination of exactly what powers, within what limits, Congress delegated to the Executive. \nThat exercise in statutory interpretation is “exclusively a judicial function,” which courts are “not \nat liberty to surrender, or to waive[.]” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 387 (2024). \n Finally, there can be no doubt that Plaintiffs are irreparably harmed by the challenged \ntariffs: as their declaration details, their business cannot avoid real, immediate, and devastating \ninjury from 145% tariffs on imports from the source of 60% of their products. The government’s \nconcerns about nationwide injunctions have no traction here, where Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief \nonly for themselves—limited relief that saves their small business without jeopardizing the “public \ninterest.” \nARGUMENT \nI. PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS \nA. IEEPA Does Not Authorize The Executive To Impose Tariffs. \n1. IEEPA’s plain text does not support the government’s interpretation.\nCongress uses unmistakable language when delegating its constitutional “Power to lay and \ncollect Taxes, Duties, and Excises” to the President. Pls.’ Br. 17. Yet the government concedes (as \nit must) that the words “taxes,” “duties,” or “tariffs” (or anything similar) appear nowhere in \nIEEPA. Resp. 11. The government instead contends that the term “regulate” implies the authority \nto impose tariffs. But the power to “regulate” is categorically different from the power to “tax” or \n“tariff.” That is why the Constitution itself separates them. See U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cls. 1 and \n3. As Chief Justice Marshall explained over two centuries ago, “the two grants are not *** similar \nin their terms or their nature.” Gibbons, 22 U.S. at 198-199.  \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 10 of 33\nThe plain meaning of “regulate” versus “tax” (or “tariff”) at the time of IEEPA’s enactment \nconfirms  the  distinction  between  the  two.  Regulation  concerns  the  imposition  of  “rules  or \nrestrictions” with an eye to controlling or governing a matter. E.g., Regulate, NEW WEBSTER’S \nDICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1264 (1975) (“to govern by or subject to certain rules or \nrestrictions”). By contrast, taxes are “sum[s] of money demanded by a government for its support \nor for specific facilities or services, levied upon incomes, property, sales, etc.” Tax, RANDOM \nHOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1456 (1973). And tariffs are simply schedules of \n“duties or customs”—i.e., taxes—“imposed by a government on imports or exports.” Tariff, \nRANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1454 (1973). As the Supreme Court \nrecently explained, “the essential feature of any tax” is that “[i]t produces at least some revenue \nfor the Government.” National Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 564 (2012).  \nNothing  in  section  1702(a)(1)(B)  of  IEEPA  suggests  an  intent  to  deviate  from  the \ntraditional distinction between the power to regulate (i.e., establish rules governing conduct) and \nthe power to tax (i.e., raise revenue). To the contrary, the rest of section 1702(a)(1)(B) indicates \nthat Congress did not understand the general term “regulate” to encompass the latter power. \nNotably, no other verb employed in the relevant provision—“investigate,” “direct,” “compel,” \n“nullify,” “void,” “prevent,” and “prohibit”1—indicates the power to raise revenue. See United \n1 To “investigate” is to “observe or study closely; inquire into systematically.” Investigate, \nWEBSTER’S THIRD NEW INTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED \n1189 (1971). To  “direct”  is  to  “guide;  order;  command;  instruct.”  Direct,  BLACK’S  LAW \nDICTIONARY 546 (4th ed. 1968). To “compel” is to “force or drive, esp[ecially] to a course of \naction.” Compel, RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 300.To “nullify” is \nto “render or declare legally void or inoperative,” as in the case of a “contract.” Nullify, RANDOM \nHOUSE  DICTIONARY  OF  THE  ENGLISH  LANGUAGE  988. To  “void”  is  to  “make  ineffectual; \ninvalidate; nullify.” Void, RANDOM HOUSE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1599. To \n“prevent” is to “hinder the progress, appearance, or fulfillment of.” Prevent, WEBSTER’S THIRD \nNEW  INTERNATIONAL  DICTIONARY  OF  THE  ENGLISH  LANGUAGE  UNABRIDGED  1798. And  to \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 11 of 33\nStates v. Hillie, 14 F.4th 677, 688 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (A statutory term’s “meaning[ ] [is] narrowed \nby the commonsense canon of noscitur a sociis—which counsels that a word is given more precise \ncontent by the neighboring words with which it is associated.” (alterations in original)).  \nTo be sure, taxation can sometimes be viewed as a “regulat[ory]” tool in a broad sense. See \nResp. 12 (citing Board of Trs. of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.S. 48, 58 (1933)); cf.Sebelius, \n567 U.S. at 564 (concluding Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate was constitutional under \nCongress’s power to tax but not its power to regulate commerce). But Defendants cite no authority \nfor the proposition that Congress’s bare grant to the Executive of the power to “regulate” somehow \nencompasses the unilateral power to demand discretionary sums of money from U.S. citizens. \nThey cannot cite a single other statute in which a grant to the Executive of the power to “regulate” \nis understood as authority to impose taxes or tariffs. The Securities and Exchange Commission has \nhad the power to “regulate” certain “transactions on a national securities exchange” for nearly a \ncentury. 15 U.S.C. § 78k(a)(2); see also Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-291, \n§ 11(a)(1), 48 Stat. 881, 891 (“The Commission shall prescribe *** rules and regulations *** to \nregulate or prevent floor trading by members of national securities exchanges.” (emphasis added)). \nYet the SEC has never thereby asserted a power to tax such transactions. Nor has the Food and \nDrug  Administration  claimed  the  power  to  tax  any  “drug,  biological  product,  device, \nor *** combination product” based on that agency’s authority to “regulate” such products. 21 \nU.S.C. § 360bbb-2(a). No surprise that when Congress does seek to address the authority to \nregulate and the authority to tax in a single provision, it names the two as individually distinct \npowers. See, e.g., 49 U.S.C. § 40117(j) (state actors may not “tax, regulate, or prohibit *** the \n“prohibit”  is  to  “forbid  by  authority  or  command.”  Prohibit,  WEBSTER’S  THIRD  NEW \nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE UNABRIDGED 1813.\n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 12 of 33\nimposition or collection of a passenger facility charge or the use of the revenue from the passenger \nfacility charge” (emphasis added)); 16 U.S.C. § 460bbb-9(a) (specifying state still had power “to \ntax *** private property on the lands and waters included in the recreation area, or to regulate the \nprivate lands within the recreation area” (emphases added)); see also 2 U.S.C. § 622(8)(B)(1) \n(“government-sponsored  enterprise”  does  not  have  “power  to  tax  or  to  regulate  interstate \ncommerce” (emphasis added)). \nThe government has little response to the fact that IEEPA’s plain language does not \nempower the Executive Branch to impose tariffs. It argues that section 1702 of IEEPA grants the \nPresident  “wide-ranging  powers.”  Resp.  13.  But  that  grant  “is  not limitless.”  Van  Loon  v. \nDepartment of the Treasury, 122 F.4th 549, 571 (5th Cir. 2024). Section 1702 is a reticulated \nscheme that lists a number of distinct methods by which the President can control property in \nwhich a foreign country or person has an interest. When the property is subject to U.S. jurisdiction, \nthose powers allow the President to temporarily “block” or permanently “prohibit” the acquisition, \nimportation, or exportation of such property. They allow him to “nullify” a transaction involving \nthat property or “compel” its transfer. And they allow him to “regulate” such property transactions \nthrough, for instance, the Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”), which establish licensing \npolicies and conditions for dual-use and certain defense articles (transferred from IEEPA to \nanother statute since 2001). CHRISTOPHER A. CASEY & PAUL K. KERR, R46814, CONG. RSCH.\nSERV., THE U.S. EXPORT CONTROL SYSTEM AND THE EXPORT CONTROL REFORM ACT OF 2018\n(2021).2 But nothing in IEEPA authorizes the President to impose revenue-raising tariffs on that \nproperty.

Int’l \nTrade Apr. 28, 2025), ECF No. 31.  \nThe verb “regulate” thus grants the President powers related to but distinct from the powers \nto block, prohibit, compel, and direct that section 1702(a)(1)(B) also grants. The government \nnonetheless argues that “regulat[e]” must mean “tariff[]” because otherwise “it would mean little, \nif anything, other than the power to ‘prevent or prohibit’ imports—leaving the term largely \nsuperfluous.” Resp. 13. But the government  elsewhere admits  that  “many” of “the[] terms \ngrant[ing] the President” power in IEEPA 1702(a)(1)(B) “partially or fully overlap,” id., so there \nwould be nothing anomalous if “regulate” overlapped with other terms too. Regardless, the notion \nthat “regulate” means only “prohibit” or “tariff,” and nothing else, blinks reality. As explained, it \nis well understood that the power to regulate includes the power to control an object’s quality or \nquantity, to establish reporting obligations, or to impose licensing requirements. See, e.g., Motor \n& Equip. Mfrs. Ass’n v. Nichols, 142 F.3d 449, 452 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (describing how the Clean \nAir Act “regulates air pollution by establishing air quality standards for certain pollutants and \ncontrolling the emissions of approximately 189 hazardous pollutants” (emphasis added)). That is \nwhy other statutes distinguish between the power to “regulate” and the power to “prohibit.” See \n15 U.S.C. § 78k(a)(2) (authorizing the Securities and Exchange Commission to “regulate or\nprohibit” certain “transactions on a national securities exchange”) (emphasis added)). And that is \nwhy IEEPA has been invoked as authority for the EAR— which, in establishing a licensing regime \nfor dual-use exports, does far more than merely “prevent or prohibit.” See CASEY &KERR, supra. \nIt  is  the  government’s  interpretation  that  would  render  much  of  section 1702(a)(1) \nsuperfluous. If “regulate” has as broad a meaning as the government contends, there would be no \nneed for the provision to specify the President’s power to “investigate, block during the pendency \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 14 of 33\nof an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit *** any property \nin which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” Under the government’s \nreading, Congress would have accomplished the exact same thing by simply authorizing the \nPresident “to regulate any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any \ninterest.” The government’s construction thus suffers from the “fatal flaw” of “yield[ing] exactly \nthe same meaning that would result if [the statute] did not contain the [additional] words *** at \nall.” U.S. ex rel. Totten v. Bombardier Corp., 380 F.3d 488, 498 (D.C. Cir. 2004). Indeed, if \nIEEPA’s use of “regulate” authorized tariffs upon the President’s designation of a national \nemergency (which the government contends is unreviewable), then it would also render nugatory \nthe multiple laws  that  Congress enacted in Title 19 specifically to channel the President’s \nimposition of tariffs. See Pls.’ Br. 20-21. \nThat the President purports to “regulate” property in which no foreign person or country \nhas any “interest” whatsoever underscores that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs. IEEPA does not \napply to all property, but only “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has \nany interest.” 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B) (emphasis added). To fall under section 1702(a)(1)(B), \nthere must be some foreign “interest” in the relevant “property,” and the interest must be one that \nthe foreign country or national “has”—that is, it must be a present interest in the property. See\nReal v. Simon, 510 F.2d 557, 562 (5th Cir. 1975) (concluding the Trading with the Enemy Act \n(“TWEA”) did not apply because no foreign national “retains an interest” in the relevant property \n(emphasis added)). Had Congress wished to include property in which a foreign country or national \npreviously had an interest, Congress could easily have done so—exactly as it did in the same \nsubsection, specifying that the President could require individuals to keep records of property in \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 15 of 33\nwhich a foreign country or national “has or has had any interest.” 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(2) \n(emphasis added).  \nDefendants  cannot  dispute  that  much  imported  property  (including  Plaintiffs’  own \nproperty, see Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 5) is property in which no foreign country or national thereof \nhas any present “interest” at the time the duty is paid domestically by U.S. importers, which often \nalready have taken full title and control all interests in the imported goods. See 19 U.S.C. \n§ 1484(a)(2)(B) (generally authorizing only “owner or purchaser of the merchandise” to be \nimporter of record). Tariffs on imported goods are typically paid after the merchandise is entered \ninto the United States. See U.S. Customs & Border Protection, Entry Summary and Post Release \nProcesses,  https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary  (last  modified \nApr. 10, 2025) (“Within 10 days of the release of the cargo, the importer must pay the estimated \nduties on their imported goods.”); see also Liz Young, A Step-by-Step Look at How Trump’s New \nTariffs  Will  Be  Implemented,  WALL  ST. J.  (Apr.  9,  2025), \nhttps://www.wsj.com/economy/trade/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-work-guide-47527fbc  (“Levies \naren’t collected at a tollbooth as goods cross the border. Instead, importers must calculate and pay \nthe duties electronically or by check after the fact.”). It also makes no difference that IEEPA’s \nreach extends beyond “mere ownership.” Resp. 29. Whatever “ownership” entails, all agree that \nthere must be some actual foreign interest in the relevant property, which is all Defendants’ \nunremarkable authority confirms. See id. at 29-30. Defendants’ interpretation of “regulate” as \nencompassing the power to levy tariffs would empower the President to tax property wholly owned \nand controlled by U.S. persons on American soil—something IEEPA does not allow. \nThe government also invokes legislative history and context as purported support for its \ninterpretation. Resp. 19-20. But it does not (and cannot) refute the fact that there is zero mention \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 16 of 33\n(explicitly or implicitly) of a power to levy tariffs in any of the history leading to either TWEA or \nIEEPA. See Pls.’ Br. 16-28; see also Opp’n to Defs.’ Mot. to Transfer to the U.S. Court of Int’l \nTrade 9, State of Cal. v. Donald J. Trump, No. 3:25-cv-03372-JSC (N.D. Cal. May 1, 2025), ECF \nNo. 12. And, as discussed next, the government misunderstands the sole historical example on \nwhich it relies. \n2. Yoshida cannot salvage the IEEPA tariffs. \nTellingly, it is not section 1702’s text that the government leans on most heavily, but \ninstead a decades-old decision from the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals \n(“CCPA”) analyzing a different statute. See Resp. 2, 4, 12, 14, 16-19, 23, 26-28, 32, 35. That \nYoshida decision, in turn, reversed a decision from a three-judge panel of the U.S. Customs Court \n(which the government elsewhere refers to as an expert court). The customs court had concluded \nthat TWEA did not authorize President Nixon to impose tariffs. Yoshida Int’l, Inc. v. United States \n(Yoshida I), 378 F. Supp. 1155, 1162 (Cust. Ct. 1974), rev’d, Yoshida II, 526 F.2d 560 (C.C.P.A. \n1975). The CCPA’s contrary decision holds no precedential value for this Court, was wrongly \ndecided, and in any case is inapposite. \nAt the threshold, the government errs in saying President Nixon “invoked TWEA” or \n“use[d] *** TWEA to impose tariffs.” Resp. 2, 17; see id. at 23. As the House Report on IEEPA \nexplains, “[TWEA] was not among the statutes cited in the President’s proclamation as authority \nfor the surcharge[.]” H.REP.NO. 95-459, at 5 (1977) (emphasis added). Instead, TWEA was only \n“cited later by the Government in response to a suit brought in Customs Court by Yoshida \nInternational challenging the surcharge.” Id. Although Plaintiffs’ motion made that clear, Pls.’ Br. \n25, the government misleadingly implies otherwise by selectively quoting the same legislative \nhistory. Compare Resp. 17 (House Report “recounted that ‘section 5(b) [of TWEA] came into play \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 17 of 33\nwhen *** President Nixon declared a national emergency *** and under that emergency imposed \na surcharge on imports[.]” (first alteration and ellipses in original)).  \nIn reality, President Nixon’s August 1971 proclamation imposing a tariff on imported \ngoods, Proclamation No. 4074, 36 Fed. Reg. 15,724 (Aug. 17, 1971)—which was rescinded four \nmonths later, Proclamation No. 4098, 36 Fed. Reg. 24,201 (Dec. 22, 1971)—cited only the Tariff \nAct of 1930 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. When an importer later challenged those tariffs \nin the U.S. Customs Court (the predecessor to the Court of International Trade), the government \nin litigation relied on the two acts the Proclamation had cited but also advanced an alternative \nargument that the tariffs were authorized by section 5(b) of the TWEA. Yoshida I, 378 F. Supp. at \n1157.  \nA three-judge Customs Court panel held that section 5(b) of TWEA could not authorize \nthe tariffs because “regulate” as used in section 5(b) did not include the imposition of tariffs. 378 \nF.  Supp.  at  1172.  Among  other  reasons,  TWEA  contained  “delineating  and  restrictive \nphraseology” that “was employed in order to preclude the all-encompassing construction” of \n“regulate” urged by the government. Id. Otherwise, TWEA would grant the President the power \nto impose tariffs “at will, without regard to statutory rates prescribed by the Congress and without \nthe  benefit  of  standards  or  guidelines  which  must  accompany  any  valid  delegation  of  a \nconstitutional power by the Congress.” Id. Judge Maletz’s concurring opinion comprehensively \nreviewed section 5(b)’s history, concluding that “nowhere in the Congressional debates, committee \nhearings or reports on section 5(b) and the amendments thereto is there even a glimmer of a \nsuggestion  that  Congress  ever  intended—or  even  considered—this  section  as  a  vehicle  for \ndelegating any of its tariff-making authority.” Id. at 1176-1184 (Maletz, J., concurring). He further \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 18 of 33\nnoted that Congress had affirmatively rejected prior attempts to allow the President “carte blanche \nauthority” to impose tariffs. Id. at 1184. \nOn appeal, however, the CCPA reversed. In doing so, the CCPA took an explicitly \npurposive rather than textualist approach to conclude that the President could impose tariffs under \nTWEA’s grant of the “power to ‘regulate importation.’” Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 573. The CCPA \nacknowledged that “no undelegated power to regulate commerce, or to set tariffs, inheres in the \nPresidency,” id. at 572; that “nothing in the TWEA or in its history *** specifically either \nauthorizes or prohibits the imposition of a surcharge,” id. at 572-573; and that “Congress did not \nspecify that the President could use a surcharge in a national emergency.” Id. at 576. The CCPA \nnevertheless concluded that because nothing in the legislative history of section 5(b) indicated an \nintent to prohibit tariffs, section 5(b) necessarily must have authorized the impositionof tariffs. Id. \nLooking  to  TWEA’s  purpose, the  CCPA  emphasized  that  “the  primary  implication  of  an \nemergency power is that it should be effective to deal with a national emergency successfully.” Id. \nat 573. Rather than analyze TWEA’s list of specific powers, the CCPA simply noted that the \nstatute’s grant of authority was “broad indeed.” Id. And while purporting to agree with the Customs \nCourt regarding the “necessity of determining the scope and extent of delegated regulatory power,” \nid. at 574, the CCPA placed no parameters on the meaning of “regulate” at all—including vis-à-\nvis tariffs, id. at 578-579. But as the Customs Court explained, recognizing that tariffs sometimes \nserve regulatory purposes (broadly speaking) does not answer the crucial question of whether \nCongress intended “th[is] statutory language” to authorize the Executive Branch to impose tariffs. \n378 F. Supp. at 1171 (emphasis added).  \nAt the same time, the CCPA’s decision betrayed concern about the constitutional tension \nits holding created: IEEPA “do[es] not here sanction the exercise of an unlimited power, which, \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 19 of 33\nwe agree with the Customs Court, would be to strike a blow to our Constitution.” Yoshida, 526 \nF.2d at 583. The CCPA thus stressed certain limitations: that the 1971 tariffs did not actually apply \nto all imports but only to imports where there had been prior tariff concessions, id.;that the tariffs \nwere capped at tariff rates that had been set by Congress (and that, if the new rates exceeded \ncongressionally set rates, Congress’s rates would control), id. at 577-578; and that the tariffs were \nshort-lived (less than five months), id. at 582 n.33; see also id. at 577 (heading called “Limited \nNature of Proclamation 4074”). None of these caveats would be necessary if TWEA truly granted \nthe President broad and expansive tariffing authority to deal with any declared emergency. \nIn any event, the CCPA’s decision in Yoshida is ultimately inapposite—not just because it \nis not binding on this Court, but also because it did not in fact analyze IEEPA. IEEPA was enacted \n“to  counter  the  perceived  abuse  of  emergency  controls  by  presidents  to ***  interfere  with \ninternational trade in non-emergency, peacetime situations.” Sacks v. Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, 466 F.3d 764, 776 (9th Cir. 2006); see also H.REP.NO. 95-459, at 1 (describing IEEPA \nas “redefin[ing] the power of the President to regulate international economic transactions in future \ntimes of war or national emergency” and, compared with TWEA, providing “somewhat narrower \npowers subject to congressional review in times of ‘national emergency’ short of war”); H. REP.\nNO. 95-459, at 10 (Congress wanted IEEPA “standby authority” powers to be “more restricted \nthan those available during time of war”). Moreover, just before enacting IEEPA, Congress passed \nSection 122 of the Trade Act of 1974, which specifically addressed trade exigencies and authorized \nthe President to impose an “import surcharge *** in the form of duties *** on articles imported \ninto the United States” to “deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits,” \n19 U.S.C. § 2132(a), and to respond to other countries’ burdensome trade practices by imposing \n“duties or other import restrictions,” id. § 2411(c). There would have been no need for Section 122 \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 20 of 33\nif  Congress  understood  TWEA—and  then  IEEPA—to  cover  the  same  ground.  These \ndevelopments make clear that Congress did not intend to lodge any tariff power in IEEPA at all. \nThe government nonetheless suggests that Congress must have intended to empower the \nPresident to impose tariffs under IEEPA simply because IEEPA carried over some of TWEA’s \nlanguage, and Congress was aware of the Yoshida decisions when it enacted IEEPA. Resp. 17. But \ncourts assume that Congress adopts an “earlier judicial construction of [a] phrase” only “[w]here \nthere is settled precedent”—such as Supreme Court precedent—“on the interpretation of a statute.” \nUnited States v. Collazo, 984 F.3d 1308, 1328 (9th Cir. 2021) (emphasis added); see Georgia v. \nPublic.Resource.Org, Inc., 590 U.S. 255, 270 (2020) (“[W]e presume that Congress ‘adopted also \nthe construction given by this Court to such language, and made it a part of the enactment.’” \n(emphasis added) (quoting Helsinn Healthcare S.A. v. Teva Pharms. USA, Inc., 586 U.S. 123, 131 \n(2019)). Two conflicting lower court decisions from a single case taking opposite stances on the \nconstruction of a statute hardly count as “settled precedent.” And Congress’s other legislative \nresponses to President Nixon’s actions confirm that it was creating different, more-limited tools, \nnot blessing the President’s actions. \n3. A clearer statutory basis is required to invoke an unheralded power of \nsuch economic and political magnitude. \nThe magnitude of the IEEPA tariffs’ economic and political consequences—combined \nwith the fact that no President has ever previously relied on IEEPA (or even TWEA) to impose a \ntariff—requires the government to point to a “clear” statutory basis for that power. West Virginia \nv. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 722-724 (2022); see Pls.’ Br. 27-29. The government cannot make that \nshowing. In fact, it hardly tries, primarily arguing that the “major questions” doctrine does not \napply.  \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 21 of 33\nFor one, the government claims (Resp. 21) that the doctrine does not apply to presidential \nactions at all. But in the doctrine’s short history, three appellate courts have already said otherwise. \nSee Kentucky v. Biden, 23 F.4th 585, 606-608 (6th Cir. 2022) (applying major questions doctrine \nto exercise of President’s proprietary authority); Louisiana v. Biden, 55 F.4th 1017, 1029 (5th Cir. \n2022) (same); Georgia v. President of the U.S., 46 F.4th 1283, 1295-1296 (11th Cir. 2022) (same); \nsee also Nebraska v. Su, 121 F.4th 1, 17-22 (9th Cir. 2024) (Nelson, J., concurring) (closely \nanalyzing whether “major questions doctrine” applies to presidential delegations and concluding \nthat “nothing excuses the President from its commands”). Defendants unsurprisingly cite no \ncontrary authority. The major questions doctrine is fundamentally concerned with the question of \ndelegation  of  congressional  authority;  that  is,  whether  Congress  intended  “to  confer  [the] \nauthority” now claimed by the Executive Branch. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 721; see also id. \n(asking whether Congress could “have intended to delegate *** sweeping and consequential \nauthority in so cryptic a fashion” (internal quotation marks omitted)). After all, absent vigilance \nover limits on delegated authority, “[l]egislation would risk becoming nothing more than the will \nof the current President[.]” Id. at 739 (Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nThe government next suggests that the major questions doctrine does not apply to national-\nsecurity and foreign-policy matters because presidents are typically afforded deference in those \nareas. Resp. 21-22. But when the President assumes powers “the Constitution has expressly \nconfided to the Congress and not to the President,” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 \nU.S. 579, 582 (1952)—like the power to tariff—deference is afforded only so long as the President \nacts “pursuant to the ‘authorization of Congress,’” Resp. 22 (quoting Youngstown, 343 U.S. at \n635-636). The major questions doctrine is a tool for determining the parameters of any such \nauthorization. And while deference might be afforded to the President when it comes to factfinding \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 22 of 33\nor where Congress has unambiguously left a decision to the President’s discretion, no deference is \notherwise owed the President’s statutory interpretation. See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 388-389. \nThat is particularly so when the interpretation concerns the scope of delegated authority—“perhaps \nthe occasion on which abdication *** is least appropriate.” Id. at 401. \nThe government moreover conflates the President’s goal (foreign policy) with his means \n(tariffs). Resp. 23-24. He may have constitutional power and delegated authority for the former, \nbut what matters is his constitutional power and delegated authority for the latter. See West \nVirginia, 597 U.S. at 730 (“Forbidding evictions may slow the spread of disease, but the CDC’s \nordering such a measure certainly raise[s] an eyebrow. We would not expect the Department of \nHomeland Security to make trade or foreign policy even though doing so could decrease illegal \nimmigration.” (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)). When \nCongress does delegate its tariff authority to the Executive Branch, it enacts carefully tailored laws \nthat expressly permit the President or an agency to impose tariffs in specified circumstances after \nfollowing required procedures. See Pls.’ Br. 17, 20-21. It does not trust the Executive with the \nunbridled authority he now claims under IEEPA. \nThe government finally contends that the President’s exercise of tariff power under IEEPA \nis not unprecedented given that “[t]he President exercised his tariff power under materially \nidentical language in IEEPA’s predecessor statute.” Resp. 23. But again, that is false: President \nNixon did not invoke TWEA to support his authority to impose peacetime tariffs; instead, \ngovernment counsel cited it only after the fact to defend his actions in court. H.REP.NO. 95-459, \nat 5. Such post hoc, made-for-litigation justification is hardly a compelling “assertion of power by \nthose who presumably would be alert to exercise it.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 725. As for the \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 23 of 33\nrest of the government’s purportedly “robust” history (Resp. 23), none involves an imposition of \ntariffs pursuant to IEEPA. \nIf this Court has any doubts as to whether IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs, \nit should rely on the doctrine of constitutional avoidance to conclude it does not. See Pls.’ Br. 36-\n38.  The  government’s  interpretation—granting  the  President  unfettered  and  unreviewable \ndiscretion to declare emergencies and remake the American and global economies by imposing \ntariffs of any size or duration—raises far more than a “serious doubt” about the constitutionality \nof IEEPA. \nB. The Challenged Tariffs Fail To Comport With IEEPA’s Requirements. \n1. The Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order is not based on an “unusual” \nnational emergency threat. \nBeyond IEEPA’s lack of tariff authority, IEEPA limits the President to addressing only a \nthreat that is “unusual and extraordinary.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a). The annual U.S. goods trade \ndeficits the President invoked to justify the Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order are anything \nbut: they have existed for 50 years. Pls.’ Br. 31. The President’s own Order characterizes those \ndeficits as “persistent.” Exec. Order No. 14,257, Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to \nRectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade \nDeficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041, 15,041 (Apr. 2, 2025). The President cannot claim a national \nemergency is “unusual” when his own description concedes it is not. \nThe government’s main response is that the decision to declare a “national emergency” is \na question reserved to the political branches. Resp. 31-36. But none of the traditional Baker factors \ncounsels against judicial determination here. See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217 (1962).  \nFor one, Plaintiffs do not ask this Court to make an “initial policy determination of a kind \nclearly for nonjudicial discretion.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. To be clear, Plaintiffs do not ask this \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 24 of 33\nCourt to adjudicate whether the U.S. goods trade deficits constitute a national emergency—a \ndetermination arguably left to the President’s discretion. See 50 U.S.C. § 1621(a). But IEEPA \nplaces additional requirements for the President’s exercise of power. Under IEEPA’s text, the \nPresident  can  act  only  in  the  case  of  a  national  emergency  threat  that  is  “unusual  and \nextraordinary.”  Id.  §  1701(a).  To  be  “unusual”  is  to  be  “rare,”  Unusual,  NEW WEBSTER’S \nDICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE 1698 (1975)—something the long-standing trade deficit \nis not. \nLegislative context confirms that Congress intended to limit the President’s IEEPA powers \nto truly unique circumstances. See Genus Med. Techs. LLC v. FDA, 994 F.3d 631, 643 (D.C. Cir. \n2021) (legislative history can help “confirm [a court’s] reading of the text”). In enacting IEEPA, \nCongress expressed concern that the President had previously been given “essentially an unlimited \ngrant of authority *** in both the domestic and international economic arena” whenever there was \nan “unterminated declaration of national emergency on the books.” H. REP. NO. 95-459, at 7. \nCongress thus insisted that any emergency that could justify the exercise of IEEPA powers had to \nbe one that would be “rare and brief” and not “equated with normal, ongoing problems.” Id. at 10. \nIEEPA’s statutory language reflects that intent. \nThere are also “judicially discoverable and manageable standards” to resolve whether a \ndeclared national emergency threat is “unusual.” Baker, 369 U.S. at 217. In asking whether a \npunishment is “unusual” in the Eighth Amendment context, courts ask whether a punishment is \n“different from that which is generally done.” Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86, 100 n.32 (1958). To \ndetermine whether stock sales are “unusual” in the securities context, courts look to amounts and \ntiming to determine whether the sales are “significantly different *** from the directors’ previous \ntrading practices.” In re Verifone Holdings, Inc. S’holder Derivative Litig., No. 07-cv-06347 \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 25 of 33\n(MHP), 2009 WL 1458233, at *9 (N.D. Cal. May 26, 2009). Determining whether the national \nemergency is “unusual” does not require the Court to decide whether the President’s “action was \nwise.” Al-Tamimi v. Adelson, 916 F.3d 1, 11 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIt presents a distinct “legal issue[],” requiring this Court to determine only whether the concededly \nlongstanding U.S. trade deficit is different from challenges routinely faced by the United States.  \nLastly, the fact that the application of IEEPA implicates issues of national security and \nforeign affairs does not remove the President’s decisionmaking from this Court’s review. Contra \nResp. 35. The Supreme Court has long cautioned that “it is error to suppose that every case or \ncontroversy which touches foreign relations lies beyond judicial cognizance.” Baker, 369 U.S. at \n211; see also El-Shifa Pharm. Indus. Co. v. United States, 607 F.3d 836, 856 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 2010) \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“[F]rom the time of John Marshall to the present, the Court has \ndecided many sensitive and controversial cases that had enormous national security or foreign \npolicy ramifications.”).  \n2. The  challenged  tariffs  are  not  “reasonably  related”  to  the  claimed \nnational emergency. \nFor the reasons described in Plaintiffs’ opening brief, the challenged  tariffs  are not \n“reasonably  related”  to  the  claimed  national  emergency  threat.  See  Pls.’  Br.  32-35.  The \ngovernment argues that, too, is a political question. But again, Congress placed limits on the \nPresident’s ability to exercise his IEEPA powers, and it is within this Court’s power to adjudicate \nwhether he has stayed within those limits. Specifically, Congress made clear that the President \nmay exercise his IEEPA powers only “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect \nto which a national emergency has been declared” and that those powers may “not be exercised \nfor any other purpose.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). By requiring that the exercise of power actually \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 26 of 33\n“deal” with the threat and not be exercised for “any other purpose,” IEEPA’s text limits the \nPresident’s actions to those that have a reasonable nexus to the national emergency. \nAssessing whether there is a reasonable relationship between the government’s ends and \nits means “is a familiar judicial exercise.” Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. 189, \n196 (2012); see, e.g., American Meat Inst. v. United States Dep’t of Agric., 760 F.3d 18, 26 (D.C. \nCir. 2014) (inquiring into whether there was a “reasonable fit between means and ends” (internal \nquotation marks and citation omitted)). In the TWEA context, courts have thus been ready to assess \nwhether “the President’s action [is] rationally related to the national emergencies invoked.” United \nStates v. Spawr Optical Rsch., Inc., 685 F.2d 1076, 1081 (9th Cir. 1982); see also Yoshida II, 526 \nF.2d at 579 n.29 (“[T]he courts stand ready to inhibit actions not reasonably related to the authority \ngranted[.]”). This Court can also easily assess whether the President exercised his emergency \npowers for a purpose “other” than the claimed national emergency threat: in this case, the Court \nneed only look to the President’s own articulated justifications explaining the “other” reasons for \nthe IEEPA tariffs. See Pls.’ Br. 34-35.3\n3 In a different IEEPA case, this Court concluded that the political question doctrine applied to \nthe question of whether the President’s actions “deal[t] with” the stated national emergency. See \nHtet v. Trump, No. 24-cv-1446 (RC), 2025 WL 522033, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025). But the \nCourt acknowledged that section 1701(b) “deliberately places at least some boundaries on the \nPresident’s use of Section 1702 powers” and cautioned that “the political question doctrine m[ight] \nnot apply to a more extreme fact pattern.” Id. at *6 n.3 (citing Gonzalez-Vera v. Kissinger, 449 \nF.3d 1260, 1264 (D.C. Cir. 2006)). This is that fact pattern. In Htet, the plaintiff asked this Court \nto determine whether authorizing sanctions against the adult children of designated individuals \n“effectively counters the threat to democracy and political rights in Burma.” Id. at *7. Here, by \ncontrast, Plaintiffs ask this Court to determine only the reasonableness of the relationship between \nthe President’s goal of reducing the overall U.S. trade deficit and, for instance, his imposition of \ntariffs on countries that already help reduce that deficit. See Pls.’ Br. 33. The disconnect here is \nglaring.\n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 27 of 33\nII. PLAINTIFFS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A LIKELIHOOD OF IRREPARABLE \nHARM \nPlaintiffs have easily demonstrated that “irreparable injury is likely in the absence of an \ninjunction.” Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008). The declaration \naccompanying Plaintiffs’ Preliminary Injunction Motion describes several concrete and wholly \nunrecoverable harms, both actual and imminent, arising from the challenged tariffs.  \nDefendants dismiss those harms as “speculative,” trivialize their significance, and assert \nthat they amount to nothing more than a “temporary loss of income.” Resp. 36-40. These \narguments defy reality. The companies’ CEO painstakingly recounts how the tariffs are already \ncausing Plaintiffs to lose substantial sales and suffer other debilitating harm. For example, he \nexplains: \n “As  of  April  21st,  we  have  received  cancellations  and  ‘stop  shipment’ \ninstructions for direct import orders totaling more than $1 million because of \nthe new tariffs.” Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 10. \n “Because of the tariffs, we have already had to cancel shipments and delay \nproduction in China.” Id. ¶ 21. \n “The Companies have collectively already paid over $1 million based on the \nnew 2025 tariff rates,” id. ¶ 7, and “the total estimated duties and tariffs on all \nof the merchandise in” shipments en route “is greater than $1 million,” “which \nconstitutes an extraordinary and unplanned expense.” Id.\n “To address the financial impact of the sudden, unbudgeted and massive tariff \ncost[,]” Plaintiffs “have been working to cut [their] operating expenses by 10% \nsince January and will need to cut those expenses even further,” including costs \n“on cash expenditures like advertising, CapEx, and hiring.” Id. ¶ 13. \n Plaintiffs “have no realistic way to cover these [tariff] costs, which means the \ntariffs act as an immediate ban on the products we import.” Id. ¶ 15. \nThe CEO’s predictive judgment about the snowballing impacts of continuing IEEPA tariffs \nis based on articulated experience and data. For instance, in addition to the cancellations and stop \nshipment orders, he explains that Plaintiffs have lost sales in the past based on price increases of \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 28 of 33\nless than 2%. Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 18. That the far greater (70%+) price hikes necessitated by \nmassive new tariffs are likely to lead to permanently lost sales follows as a matter of common \nsense. Id. ¶ 9. The CEO explains how he determined that paying the tariffs in 2025 would result \nin more than $100 million in cash expenditures—an amount exceeding the amount Plaintiffs \nbudgeted for every non-salary expense combined. Id. ¶ 14. His expectation of a year-over-year \nsales decline of at least 25% and perhaps as much as 50% is based on these realities, not \nspeculation.  Id.  ¶ 11.  Even  President  Trump  recently  acknowledged  what  everyone  (except \nDefendants’ brief) already understands: these tariffs will lead to empty shelves, fewer sales, and \nhigher prices. See Michael Collins, ‘Two Dolls Instead of 30’: Trump Acknowledges Prices Will \nForce  Consumers  to  Cut  Back,  USA TODAY  (Apr.  30,  2025), \nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/30/trump-china-tariffs-\ntoys/83372961007/ (President: “You know, somebody said, ‘Oh, the shelves are going to be \nopen.’” “Well, maybe the children will have two dolls instead of 30 dolls” and “maybe the two \ndolls will cost a couple of bucks more than they would normally.”).4\n Defendants nonetheless make the astonishing argument that the harms from the 145% \nIEEPA tariffs on China are “not sufficient” because “only” about “‘60% of the products [plaintiffs] \nsell or consume as components (by costs) are manufactured in China.’” Resp. 37 (quoting \nWoldenberg Decl. ¶¶ 6, 27). “Only”? The notion (as any business owner can confirm) that an \n“[i]njury is not ‘certain’ or ‘great’ if it affects only about half of plaintiffs’ business,” id. at 38 \n4 Of course, Plaintiffs are hardly alone in facing these harms. According to a recent survey of \n410 small- and medium-sized members of the Toy Association, more than 80% are delaying \norders, well more than half are cancelling orders, and nearly half have reported that they would go \nout of business within weeks or months. The Toy Association, Christmas and Toy Companies are \nat Risk! Toy Association Member Survey Reveals Alarming Impact of 145% Tariffs (Apr. 18, \n2025),  https://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2025_News/toy-association-member-\nsurvey-reveals-alarming-impact-of-145-percent-tariffs.aspx.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 29 of 33\n(citation omitted), is both deeply misguided and (unsurprisingly) unsupported by any precedent. \nThis is not a situation in which a Fortune 20 company is claiming irreparable harm based upon \nlosses of less than 1 percent of its total sales. See Resp. 38-39 (citing Cardinal Health, Inc. v. \nHolder, 846 F. Supp. 2d 203, 211 (D.D.C. 2012)).5\nThe specified harms, moreover, are neither temporary nor remediable later. Defendants \nacknowledge that any financial remedy available to Plaintiffs would be limited to a refund of the \nduties paid (though they cryptically suggest that “loss of business opportunities and goodwill” may \nbe recovered “indirectly,” Resp. 38). But a refund is wholly inadequate when no products can be \nimported feasibly and thus no duties are ever paid. Regardless, it takes no great imagination to \nunderstand that a someday possible refund could not come close to making Plaintiffs whole on \ntheir loss of income or their inability to import products, fill customer orders, obtain critical \nfinancing, and maintain feasible pricing right now. Floating an extra $100 million is not something \nPlaintiffs can do. Recognizing that undeniable fact hardly creates a “‘per se irreparable harm rule’ \nin tariff challenges.” Id. at 36-37 (quoting Corus Grp. PLC v. Bush, 217 F. Supp. 2d 1347, 1355 \n(Ct. Int’l Trade 2002)). Instead, it simply acknowledges that the devastating harms posed by these \nspecific tariffs, on these specific family-owned U.S. businesses, are irreparable. \nIII. THE  BALANCE  OF  THE  EQUITIES  AND  PUBLIC  INTEREST  FAVOR \nPLAINTIFFS \nDefendants’ discussion of the equities and public interest rests on inapplicable concerns \nassociated with nationwide preliminary injunctions. See Resp. 42-43. Plaintiffs here are seeking to \n5 Defendants claim that Plaintiffs “recently moved 16 percent of their manufacturing away \nfrom the PRC at a comparatively minimal cost,” and thus any injury from the tariffs on China “can \nbe mitigated at marginal cost.” Resp. 38. That is a gross distortion of the CEO’s statement, which \nexplains that it took the company years and $2 million in out-of-pocket costs to move that small \nshare of the companies’ manufacturing out of China to other countries (all of which are now subject \nto at least 10% baseline IEEPA tariffs and larger suspended IEEPA tariffs).  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 30 of 33\nenjoin the application of the challenged tariffs as to their own imports only. Prohibiting Defendants \nfrom applying the (unlawful) tariffs to Plaintiffs temporarily, pending further litigation, will have \nnext to no impact on Defendants’ ability to pursue its asserted “foreign affairs” interests. Id. at 41.  \nRelying on Hanson v. District of Columbia, 120 F.4th 223 (D.C. Cir. 2024), Defendants \nmake speculative arguments about what would happen if other parties sought similar relief. But in \nHanson, the court had already held that plaintiff had a weak argument on the merits; plaintiff failed \nto show irreparable harm in the absence of the injunction; and defendant would suffer long-term \nharm even if the injunction were later lifted. Id. at 242-248. The plaintiff thus could not overcome \nthe case’s other shortcomings simply by asking the court to “rebalance the equities by limiting \ninjunctive relief” to the named parties. Id. at 247. By contrast, because Plaintiffs’ success and harm \nshowings here are strong and the relief they seek is limited, the Court need not speculate about \nhow the balance might play out differently in a different case. \nIV. THE COURT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE MORE THAN A NOMINAL BOND \nDefendants ask the Court to limit the preliminary injunction to Plaintiffs, which is all \nPlaintiffs seek. But Defendants also ask the Court to order Plaintiffs “to post Single Transaction \nBonds” for all such entries “in an amount equal to the total entered value, plus all applicable duties, \ntaxes, and fees, including the duties that would otherwise have been deposited pursuant to the \nexecutive orders.” Resp. 43 (emphasis added). In other words, Defendants demand a costly self-\ndefeating bond that would cover amounts beyond even the sums Plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin \nand that would still leave Plaintiffs at risk of paying the 145% tariffs after the fact, either to the \ngovernment directly or to the surety as reimbursement for collections on the bond. Just like the \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 31 of 33\ntariffs themselves, such bonding conditions would act as an effective prohibition on Plaintiffs’ \nimporting from China.6\nThe Court should reject Defendants’ request to impose a bond that would nullify the benefit \nof any preliminary injunction. Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure “has been read \nto vest broad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate amount of an injunction \nbond.” DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999). That discretion includes the \noption of not requiring a bond at all, see, e.g., National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Mgmt. \n& Budget, No. 25-cv-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 597959, at *19 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025), including \n“where requiring [one] would have the effect of denying the plaintiffs their right to judicial review \nof administrative action,” Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. Morton, 337 F. Supp. 167, 168 (D.D.C. \n1971) (collecting cases). Moreover, in considering whether to impose a bond and its amount in \ncases involving the government as the defendant, “[i]t would be a mistake to treat a revenue loss \nto the Government the same as pecuniary damage to a private party.” Id. at 169.  \nUnder those principles, the Court should exercise its discretion to impose no more than a \nnominal bond. Given the untenable costs and risks to Plaintiffs, imposing the oppressive bond the \ngovernment seeks would essentially leave them in the same position they are in now—unable to \nimport the majority of their products and suffering irreparable harm.  \nV. THE COURT MAY TREAT THE PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION MOTION IN A \nMANNER THAT ALLOWS FOR ENTRY OF FINAL JUDGMENT \nUltimately, the Court may avoid grappling with the government’s suspect arguments on \nirreparable harm, the balancing of the equities, and the bonding requirement by deciding the \nultimate merits instead of ruling on a preliminary injunction. That is because, as both parties’ \n6 Defendants also seek other burdensome and infeasible requirements, such as forcing Plaintiffs \nto “identify the entries, by entry number, importer name, and importer number, that would be \ncovered by any such order.” Resp. 43. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 32 of 33\nbriefing has confirmed, there are no factual or evidentiary disputes on the dispositive legal issue \nof whether IEEPA permits the imposition of tariffs. One procedural option is to “advance the trial \non the merits.” FED.R.CIV. P. 65(a)(2) (“Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion for a \npreliminary injunction, the court may advance the trial on the merits and consolidate it with the \nhearing.”); see, e.g., Minute Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-00385 (D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025) \n(“In the absence of opposition on the part of either party, it is hereby further ORDERED that the \nCourt’s  consideration  of  the  motion  for  preliminary  injunction  will  be  consolidated  with \nconsideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).”). Another option \nis to treat the preliminary injunction motion as one for (partial) summary judgment. See, e.g., \nCapital Area Immigrants’ Rights Coal. v. Trump, 471 F. Supp. 3d 25 (D.D.C. 2020) (issuing \nsummary judgment after converting motion for preliminary injunction); Morris v. District of \nColumbia,  38  F.  Supp.  3d  57  (D.D.C.  2014)  (same).  Either  consolidating  the  preliminary \ninjunction hearing with a “trial on the merits” or treating it as a summary judgment motion would \npermit the Court to make a definitive merits ruling regarding Defendants’ IEEPA authority and \nafford injunctive relief in a final judgment (without the need to resolve the remaining preliminary \ninjunction-specific issues, including bond).  \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should preliminarily enjoin the agency Defendants and their agents, employees, \nand all persons acting under their direction and control, from taking any action to collect tariffs \nfrom Plaintiffs under the Challenged Orders.7\n7 The government argues that this Court should “grant defendant’s motion to transfer before \nthe hearing on plaintiffs’ preliminary injunction motion.” Resp. 10. As explained in Plaintiffs’ \ntransfer response (ECF No. 18 at 12 n.7), the principal merits argument for a preliminary injunction \nis coextensive with the jurisdictional question, and the Court has already scheduled a hearing to \nconsider both motions. Accordingly, the sensible course is for the two overlapping motions to be \ndecided together. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 17     Filed 05/07/25     Page 33 of 33\nDated: May 7, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Pratik A.

United States, No. 25-cv-00043, ECF No. 15 (Ct. Int’l Trade \nMay 23, 2025).  That case, as here, challenged the President’s imposition of tariffs under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).  \nThe court in Barnes ultimately dismissed the action for lack of standing, but as pertinent \nhere, it first assessed its statutory jurisdiction and concluded it was “satisfied that it has Section \n1581(i) jurisdiction over this case.”  Id. at 5-10.  The court explained that the “President has \ndetermined to exercise [IEEPA] authority through the imposition of tariffs” and that “[i]n one of \nthe U.S. Court of International Trade’s earliest cases, the Court recognized that it had jurisdiction \nover an action challenging the imposition of a duty by the President” under identical language in \nIEEPA’s predecessor, the TWEA.  Id. at 8.  The court further noted that “the tariffs challenged \nby Plaintiff are, at least in part, targeted at controlling the illicit flow of drugs or migrants, not \nraising revenue, which satisfies the criteria articulated in 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B).”  Id. at 9.  \nAnd the court affirmed that the “Court of International Trade’s exclusive jurisdiction over tariff \ncases is significant” because it “consolidat[es] this area of administrative law” in the one forum \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 31     Filed 05/23/25     Page 2 of 2\n“with an already developed expertise in international trade and tariff matters.”  Id. at 6-7. \nDATED: May 23, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n \nOF COUNSEL:          YAAKOV M.

The President has \nasserted the authority to impose tariffs (essentially, taxes) on imports from any country, on any \nschedule, in any amount, for any policy reason couched as an “emergency,” no matter if the \nproperty is  owned by  an American or  a foreign national. Neither the  Constitution nor the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) grants the President tariff-levying \nauthority at all, let alone of the boundless type asserted here. And because Defendants’ actions are \nirreparably harming Plaintiffs Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—American family-\nowned businesses that develop educational products for schools and families—this Court should \nenjoin them before even more damage is done.  \nFor five decades and across eight presidential Administrations, no President had ever \ninvoked IEEPA to impose a tariff or duty. That all changed when President Trump unilaterally \ninvoked such authority in a series of unprecedented executive orders imposing—as well as \npausing, adjusting, increasing, and reimposing—tariffs worldwide, including an additional 145 \npercent tariff on China. This disruptive roller coaster of tariffs, which has already had a multi-\ntrillion dollar impact on the stock market, is estimated to cause U.S. GDP to shrink by hundreds \nof billions of dollars and to cost the typical American family over a thousand dollars a year. It is \nalready having devastating consequences for American businesses like Plaintiffs.  \nInvoking IEEPA to make such sweeping and drastic changes is not lawful. IEEPA is an \nemergency powers statute that allows the President to address “unusual and extraordinary threats” \nto the United States through specified means like sanctions against foreign countries and nationals. \nIt does not authorize the President to impose tariffs, let alone tariffs on nearly all goods from \naround the globe. Plaintiffs meet every requirement for a preliminary injunction. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 15 of 57\nFirst, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims. Since the President began \nhis second Term, he has repeatedly invoked IEEPA to impose tariffs on trillions of dollars of \neconomic activity. But the President’s claimed source of support for these far-reaching actions \ncannot bear their weight. The Constitution vests the power to impose tariffs exclusively in \nCongress. U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. And Congress has not authorized the President to exercise \nthat power through IEEPA. IEEPA’s silence on the matter of tariffs stands in stark contrast to the \nmany other statutes where Congress has clearly delegated tariff authority to the President. Over \nthe years, Congress has crafted a carefully reticulated scheme with respect to tariff policy, \nincluding enacting laws that expressly authorize the President or an agency to impose certain tariffs \nwithout further congressional approval. But unlike IEEPA, every one of those statutes is codified \nin Title 19 of the United States Code (governing “Customs Duties”) and applies only in limited \ncircumstances  after  required  procedures  have  been  followed.  In  addition  to  those  statutory \nauthorizations, the President may negotiate tariff agreements, but Congress retains the final say on \nwhether any agreements become law. That process did not occur with IEEPA. Rather, the historical \npractice surrounding IEEPA’s enactment and subsequent use confirm that it is not some limitless \nfont of tariffing authority for the President. \nEven if this Court were to conclude that Congress authorized the President to exercise the \npower to levy tariffs through IEEPA, the tariffs at issue do not satisfy the statutory requirements. \nIEEPA provides that the President’s authorities “may not be exercised for any other purpose” but \n“deal[ing] with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency \nhas been declared [pursuant to the National Emergencies Act].” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b) (emphasis \nadded). The trade deficit—to which the President’s universal and reciprocal tariffs are addressed—\nhas existed since before IEEPA was even enacted and is the opposite of the kind of “unusual” or \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 16 of 57\n“extraordinary” circumstance that Congress made a prerequisite for action under IEEPA. Nor are \nthe tariffs reasonably related to addressing the declared national emergencies, as required by the \nstatute. And the President’s own statements admit that he imposed tariffs for reasons beyond the \ndeclared emergencies, even though IEEPA itself bars its powers from being “exercised for any \nother purpose.”   \nThe President’s reliance on IEEPA to transform American trade policy and impose massive \ndomestic upheaval across all sectors of the economy is out of step with constitutional principles. \nWhere Congress authorizes the President to take action with such “vast economic and political \nsignificance,” “both separation of powers principles and a practical understanding of legislative \nintent” demand that congressional delegation be clear and unmistakable. West Virginia v. EPA, \n597 U.S. 697, 716, 723 (2022). IEEPA includes no such delegation. Indeed, it says nothing at all \nabout tariffs or duties. The President’s interpretation lacks any “intelligible principle” necessary \nto make IEEPA constitutional: He claims authority to impose tariffs on any goods from any \ncountry, to select any rate he desires, to change that rate at any time and for any reason, to leave \nthe tariffs in place for as long as he wants, to issue and revoke temporary pauses at his discretion, \nand to use the tariffs to address any policy concern he deems a national emergency. “This is \ndelegation running riot.” A.L.A. Schecter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 553 (1935).  \nSecond, absent this Court’s intervention, the tariffs at issue—posing frankly terrifying \nconsequences for Plaintiffs—will cause them severe and irreparable harm during this litigation. \nPlaintiffs predict that paying the IEEPA tariffs in 2025 would increase their year-over-year tariff \ncosts over 40-fold (nearly $100 million), thereby forcing Plaintiffs to raise their prices by as much \nas 70 percent just to survive. And the President’s approach of imposing tariffs with little notice, \noften suspending those same tariffs days later and then carving out various exceptions, is massively \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 17 of 57\ndestabilizing and detrimental to Plaintiffs’ supply chains, customer relationships, and business \noperations. Plaintiffs’ lost sales, profits, and customer goodwill are all forms of consequential \ndamages that cannot be recouped in a refund action. In short, like many small and medium-sized \nAmerican companies that depend on foreign manufacturing hubs, Plaintiffs face an uncertain and \nincreasingly dim future—including downsizing or worse—if the tariffs are kept in place. \nFinally, the balance of the equities and the public interest favor an injunction pending the \nCourt’s  adjudication  of  this  matter.  A  preliminary  injunction  would  protect  Plaintiffs  from \nirreparable harm, and cost the government only a temporary pause of its unlawful policies as \ndirected to Plaintiffs—including policies that the President himself has previously and repeatedly \npaused voluntarily.  \nThis Court should grant Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction. \nBACKGROUND \nA. The Constitution grants Congress the exclusive power to set tariff policy. \nThe imposition of tariffs is a distinctly legislative power assigned to Congress. U.S. CONST. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1 (granting Congress the “[p]ower [t]o lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and \nExcises”). Congress is thus “the principal venue in which trade policy is determined.” DOUGLAS \nA. IRWIN, CLASHING OVER COMMERCE: A HISTORY OF U.S.TRADE POLICY 2 (2017). Presidents \nmay “demand, protest, denounce, and complain all they want,” but existing trade policy will not \nchange absent a “majority in Congress.” Id. Because the Constitution vests the power to impose \nduties with Congress, the President’s ability to impose or alter tariffs is limited to circumstances \nwhere Congress provides specific authorization.  \nCongress did so in a series of statutory enactments, all codified under Title 19 of the U.S. \nCode, which governs “Customs Duties” and carefully circumscribes the President’s authority. See\n19 U.S.C. §§ 1338(a), 1862, 2132(a), 2411-2419. For example, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 18 of 57\n1930 grants the President the authority to “declare new or additional duties” of up to 50 percent \non  imports,  but  only  from  countries  that  have  imposed  “unreasonable”  charges,  exactions, \nregulations, or limitations that are “not equally enforced upon the like articles of every foreign \ncountry” or “[d]iscriminate[d] in fact against the commerce of the United States.” 19 U.S.C. \n§ 1338(a). Likewise, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the President to impose \n“duties” “not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem . . . on articles imported into the United States” in \norder “to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits,” but those tariffs \nexpire after 150 days unless Congress enacts legislation to extend them. 19 U.S.C. § 2132(a).1\nApart from those specific statutory authorizations, the President may negotiate trade \nagreements and trade policy on behalf of the United States under a Trade Promotion Authority \n(“TPA”), but no trade agreement becomes law via presidential signature. An agreement’s terms \nbecome law only through implementing legislation enacted by Congress.  Christopher A. Casey & \nCathleen D. Cimino-Isaacs, CONG. RSCH. SERV., IF 10038, TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY 1 \n(2024).2\nThe  narrow  statutory  authorizations  and  TPA  practice  illustrate  the  President’s \ncircumscribed role with respect to tariffs. The President has no independent power under Article \nII of the Constitution to set tariffs, and Congress “retains ultimate authority over trade policy.” \nIRWIN at 21, supra p. 4. If Congress in a statute has lawfully authorized the President to make \ndecisions regarding tariffs, he may exercise that power under his duty to “take Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed.” U.S. CONST. art. II, § 3. But absent such an authorization, “the President \n1 The balance-of-payments measures the payments into and out of a country and thus includes \nthe trade balance in goods.

S., \nInc. v. Kissinger, 506 F.2d 136, 142-143 (D.C. Cir. 1974). \nB. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act \nUnder 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a), when the President declares a national emergency pursuant to \nthe National Emergencies Act with respect to an “unusual and extraordinary threat” that has its \nsource in whole or in part outside the United States, the President may use the powers granted in \n§ 1702 to “deal with” that threat. Section 1702 provides that, in those circumstances, the President \nmay: \nunder such regulations as he may prescribe, by means of instructions, licenses, or \notherwise— \n(A)  investigate, regulate, or prohibit— \n(i)  any transactions in foreign exchange, \n(ii)  transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any \nbanking institution, to the extent that such transfers or payments \ninvolve any interest of any foreign country or a national thereof, \n(iii)  the importing or exporting of currency or securities,  \nby any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of \nthe United States; \n(B)   investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct \nand compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, any acquisition, holding, \nwithholding,  use,  transfer,  withdrawal,  transportation,  importation  or \nexportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege \nwith respect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign \ncountry or a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect \nto any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and \n(C)  when the United States is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked \nby a foreign country or foreign nationals, [take additional actions].  \n50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1) (emphasis applied to language on which Defendants rely). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 20 of 57\nIn bestowing that authority, Congress emphasized in § 1701(b) that the President may \nexercise § 1702 powers “only” when there is an “unusual and extraordinary threat” for which “a \nnational emergency has been declared,” and that § 1702 powers “may not be exercised for any \nother purpose.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). Congress also stipulated that “[a]ny exercise of [§ 1702 \npowers] to deal with any new threat shall be based on a new declaration of national emergency \nwhich must be with respect to such threat.” Id. \nSince its enactment in 1977, Presidents have invoked IEEPA to address specific threats by \nspecific countries and persons. To “deal with” these threats, Presidents have imposed different \ntypes of sanctions or remedies. Certain IEEPA-based executive orders have targeted the policies \nand actions of specific foreign governments and resulted in the imposition of comprehensive \nsanctions against countries or regions, which generally prohibit virtually all economic relations \nbetween U.S. persons and the targeted jurisdiction.3 Presidents have also sanctioned categories of \nforeign  “persons,”  which  may  include  groups,  political  parties,  terrorist  organizations, \ncorporations,  and  individuals.  Some  IEEPA  actions  have  focused  on  persons  in  identified \ngeographical areas (e.g., the Western Balkans),4 while others have focused on foreign persons \nengaged  in  activities  creating  emergency  conditions  regardless  of  nationality  or  geographic \nlocation.5 Historically, such sanctions blocked access to assets for designated persons, prevented \ntheir utilization of U.S. financial systems or credit, denied visas to or excluded the designated \n3 Currently, the Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”) \nmaintains comprehensive sanctions, in part based on IEEPA, against Cuba, Iran, North Korea, \nSyria, and the Crimea, Donetsk, and Luhansk Regions of Ukraine. Certain other countries have \nbeen targeted historically, though the emergencies have since been terminated (e.g., South Africa). \n4 E.g., Exec. Order No. 13,219, Blocking Property of Persons Who Threaten International \nStabilization Efforts in the Western Balkans, 66 Fed. Reg. 34,777 (Jun. 26, 2001). \n5 E.g., Exec. Order No. 13,581, Blocking Property of Transnational Criminal Organizations, \n76 Fed. Reg. 44,757 (Jul. 24, 2011).\n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 21 of 57\npersons from the United States, or prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in transactions with the \ndesignated persons.    \nBefore February 1, 2025, however, no President had ever invoked IEEPA to impose a tariff \nor duty on goods in the statute’s 50-year history.  \nC. This President has bypassed Congress to impose tariffs through IEEPA. \nSince taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump, through a series of executive \norders (the “Challenged Orders”6), has repeatedly bypassed Congress to unilaterally impose tariffs \nunder IEEPA. With the stroke of a pen, he has dramatically changed United States tariff policy \nwhile tacitly admitting that none of the 4,732 sections in Title 19 of the U.S. Code—the title \ngoverning customs duties—allows him to do so. \n1. The China IEEPA Orders \nThe  President  has  issued  multiple  orders  specifically  imposing  tariffs—now  at  20 \npercent—on goods from China based on a crisis involving the flow of fentanyl into the United \nStates. On February 1, 2025, the President issued an executive order imposing 10 percent tariffs \non China pursuant to “section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA.” Exec. Order No. 14,195, Imposing Duties \nto Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. \n9,121 (Feb. 1, 2025) (“February 1 China Order”). That order asserts that “the sustained influx of \nsynthetic opioids has profound consequences on our Nation,” and that China has not only “fail[ed] \nto stem the ultimate source of many illicit drugs distributed in the United States” but has actually \n“incentivized” Chinese “chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals \nthat are used to produce synthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.” Id. at 9,121. The order \n6  The  Challenged  Orders,  which  are  the  IEEPA  orders  described  below  (including \namendments), are listed in Appendix A to this memorandum. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 22 of 57\n“expand[s] the scope of the national emergency” previously declared at the southern border—i.e., \nthe U.S.-Mexico border—to “cover the failure of the [Chinese] government to arrest, seize, detain, \nor otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other TCOs, criminals at \nlarge, and drugs.” Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,122. It then invokes the President’s authority under \n“section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA” to impose “an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty” \non “[a]ll articles that are the product of [China].” Id. § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,122. \nRoughly one month later, the President raised these tariffs from 10 percent to 20 percent \nbased on his determination that China “has not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug \ncrisis through cooperative enforcement actions.” Exec. Order No. 14,228, Further Amendment to \nDuties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. \nReg. 11,463 (Mar. 3, 2025) (the “March 3 China Amendment”). And a month after that, he ordered \nthe elimination of duty-free de minimis treatment for goods subject to these tariffs, ignoring a \ncongressionally enacted statutory program that had permitted duty exemptions for imported goods \nvalued at less than $800. Exec. Order No. 14,256, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the \nSynthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value \nImports,  90  Fed.  Reg.  14,899  (Apr.  2,  2025).  These  orders  from  the  President  have  been \nimplemented by DHS and CBP through modifications to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \nUnited States (“HTSUS”). See Implementation of Additional Duties on Products of the People’s \nRepublic of China Pursuant to the President’s February 1, 2025 Executive Order Imposing Duties \nTo Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed.

Reg. 11,426 (Mar. 6, \n2025) (implementing 20 percent tariff from March 3 China Amendment).  \nThat 20 percent tariff on goods from China, along with additional tariffs described below, \nis currently in force.7\n2. The Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order \nOn April 2, 2025, the President took an even more dramatic step under IEEPA, imposing \non virtually all trading partners (i) a 10 percent universal tariff, and (ii) an additional and higher \ncountry-specific “reciprocal” tariff ranging from 11 percent to 50 percent. Exec. Order No. 14,257, \nRegulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large \nand Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 (Apr. 2, 2025) \n(the “Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order”). The order exempted only Canada and Mexico \n(because they are already subject to 25 percent IEEPA tariffs), as well Russia, North Korea, Cuba, \nand Belarus. The universal and reciprocal tariffs are in addition to congressionally enacted or \nauthorized tariffs, as well as tariffs imposed by the China IEEPA Orders, among other additional \ntariff actions.  \nBecause  IEEPA  requires  an  “unusual  and  extraordinary  threat”  as  a  predicate  for \npresidential action, the President declared that the “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade \ndeficits” are a national emergency that “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security and economy of the United States.” Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order, 90 \n7 On February 1, 2025, the President also issued two substantially similar executive orders \nimposing tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada. Each relies on IEEPA as the \nPresident’s sole source of authority. See Exec. Order No. 14,194, Imposing Duties to Address the \nSituation at Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117 (Feb. 1, 2025); Exec. Order No. 14,193, \nImposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. \n9,113 (Feb. 1, 2025). The President subsequently paused, reinstated, and amended the scope of \nthose tariff orders in ways not relevant here. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 24 of 57\nFed.  Reg.  at  15,041;  see  also  Fact  Sheet:  President  Donald  J.  Trump  Declares  National \nEmergency to Increase our Competitive Edge, Protect our Sovereignty, and Strengthen our \nNational and Economic Security, THE WHITE HOUSE (Apr. 2, 2025) (“President Trump is invoking \nhis authority under [IEEPA] to address the national emergency posed by the large and persistent \ntrade deficit[.]”).8 The order finds that those deficits are caused by “a lack of reciprocity in our \nbilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ \neconomic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.” Universal and Reciprocal \nTariff Order, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,041.The order asserts that “despite a commitment to the principle \nof reciprocity, the trading relationship between the United States and its trading partners has \nbecome highly unbalanced” because these trading partners have imposed higher duties than the \nUnited  States  and  have  employed  “non-tariff  barriers  [that]  deprive  U.S.  manufacturers  of \nreciprocal  access  to  markets.”  Id.  at  15,041-15,042.  The  order  concludes  that  “[l]arge  and \npersistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing \nbase; inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing capacity; undermined critical \nsupply chains, and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries.” Id. at \n15,041.\nThe 10 percent tariff went into effect on April 5, 2025, with the additional “reciprocal” \ntariff to take effect on April 9, 2025, as the President’s orders modified the HTSUS. But on April \n8, 2025, the President responded to retaliatory tariffs from China by raising the “reciprocal” tariff \nrate on China by 50 percentage points—from 34 percent to 84 percent. Exec.

PLAINTIFFS ARE LIKELY TO SUCCEED ON THE MERITS.  \nIn the five decades since Congress enacted IEEPA, no President—before this one—has \nused that law to impose tariffs. That is unsurprising. IEEPA is an emergency powers statute that \ndoes not authorize the President to impose any tariffs at all. And even if it granted some tariffing \npower, IEEPA does not authorize the President, without any process or input, to impose tariffs that \namount to taxes on Americans and will fundamentally refashion the United States’ economic \nrelationship with the rest of the world.  \nAt base, the President is using IEEPA to work drastic changes in American economic and \ntrade policy. But Congress must “speak clearly” to delegate “powers of vast economic and political \nsignificance” to the Executive Branch. National Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Department of Lab., \nOccupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022) (“NFIB”). Nothing in IEEPA \nspecifically  grants  the  President  “breathtaking”  and  “expansive  authority”  to  impose  tariffs \nunilaterally on essentially all goods from all countries. Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Department \nof Health & Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764-765 (2021). Under the canon of constitutional \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 30 of 57\navoidance, this Court has the duty to adopt an interpretation of IEEPA that would not raise grave \ndoubts about whether Congress unconstitutionally delegated its tariff power. Yet if the President \nis correct about the unbridled scope of his tariffing power, that is exactly what IEEPA would do.  \nA. Plain text, context, historical practice, and constitutional principles make clear \nthat IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs.  \n1. Congress is clear when it delegates its tariff authority to the Executive \nBranch.  \nThe power to raise revenue, including through tariffs, is a core legislative power. As the \nSupreme Court explained nearly a century ago, “No more essential or important power has been \nconferred upon the Congress” than the “Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, and Excises.” \nUnited States v. Jacobs, 306 U.S. 363, 370 (1939) (quoting U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1).  \nCongress has enacted statutes that authorize the President or an agency to exercise tariff \npower in specified circumstances. But when it has done so, it has used unmistakable language to \ngrant the Executive Branch that authority. For example, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 \nauthorizes the President to impose an “import surcharge . . . in the form of duties . . . on articles \nimported into the United States” to “deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments \ndeficits.” 19 U.S.C. § 2132(a) (emphasis added). Section 338 of the Tariff Act of 1930 grants the \nPresident the authority to “declare new or additional duties” on imports where a country has treated \nthe United States in a discriminatory fashion. 19 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (emphasis added). And Section \n301 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes the United States Trade Representative—who serves \nunder the President—to “impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of” a foreign \ncountry in specified circumstances. 19 U.S.C. § 2411(c) (emphasis added).  \n2. IEEPA’s plain text and context does not authorize tariffs.  \nIn contrast to those laws, IEEPA does not even use the word “tariffs” or “duties” (or similar \nterms). IEEPA is an emergency powers statute that allows the President to take certain specified \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 31 of 57\nactions with respect to foreign persons, goods, and property during a declared national emergency. \nIt provides in pertinent part: “the President may . . . investigate, block during the pendency of an \ninvestigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit” the “importation or \nexportation” of “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” 50 \nU.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B). The statute does not contain a catchall phrase empowering the President \nto take additional, unenumerated actions beyond those listed. Noticeably absent from the list is the \npower to “impose tariffs,” “impose duties,” add a “surcharge,” or take any similar action. \nThe grant of authority to the President to “regulate” imports and exports is not a substitute. \nNo other statute providing the President with tariff authority does so simply by authorizing the \nExecutive Branch to “regulate.” That is because raising revenue by imposing tariffs on imports \nand exports is fundamentally different from “regulat[ing]” them. To “regulate” an activity is to \n“control by rule” or “subject to restrictions.” Regulate, THE CONCISE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF \nCURRENT ENGLISH 943 (6th ed. 1976); see also Regulate, NEW WEBSTER’S DICTIONARY OF THE \nENGLISH LANGUAGE 1264 (1975) (“to govern by or subject to certain rules or restrictions”);\nRegulate,  FUNK  & WAGNALLS  STANDARD  COLLEGE  DICTIONARY  1133  (1977)  (“[t]o  direct, \nmanage, or control according to certain rules”). Thus, when a statute authorizes an agency to \n“promulgate regulations” on a topic, it authorizes that agency to implement rules or restrictions \nabout that topic, including characteristics like quantity, quality, or location, within the parameters \nset by that statute. It does not authorize—absent additional and tailored language—the agency to \nraise revenue for that topic by imposing fees, tariffs, or taxes. Cf. Diginet, Inc. v. Western Union \nATS, Inc., 958 F.2d 1388, 1392, 1399 (7th Cir. 1992) (municipality’s power to regulate did not \ninclude power to “raise revenue[s]” absent “explicit authority” because “[t]he legal power to \nregulate is not necessarily the legal power to tax”). \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 32 of 57\nThe Constitution itself recognizes the distinction between the authority to regulate imports \nand the authority to impose tariffs. Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution vests the \nCongress with the “[p]ower [t]o lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.” By contrast, \nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 3 empowers the Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign \nNations.” If imposing tariffs and duties were included within Clause 3’s power to “regulate” \nforeign commerce, then there would be no need for the Constitution to specifically enumerate the \npower to impose tariffs. The Constitution, however, treats them separately because they serve \ndifferent functions and are not substitutes for one another. At a minimum, the Constitution’s \nexpress grant of authority to lay and collect duties, separate from the authority to regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations, confirms that the power to regulate such commerce does not \nclearly encompass the authority to impose duties upon it. \nWith Congress legislating against that backdrop, it is no surprise that IEEPA’s statutory \ncontext confirms the point. First, none of the other enumerated powers in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) \nsuggest that the term “regulate” incorporates the power to impose tariffs. The President can \n“investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, . . . direct and compel, nullify, void, \nprevent[,] or prohibit” the “importation” of property. 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B). All of these \nauthorize non-tariff means of controlling imports—and, specifically, controlling the quantity or \nquality of them. Given that each of the activities IEEPA authorizes the President to take with \nrespect to imports is a non-tariff action and non-revenue action, the term “regulate” should not be \nread beyond its ordinary bounds to include raising revenue. See United States v. Hillie, 14 F.4th \n677, 688 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (A statutory term’s “meaning[ ] [is] narrowed by the commonsense \ncanon of noscitur a sociis—which counsels that a word is given more precise content by the \nneighboring words with which it is associated.” (alterations in original) (quoting United States v. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 33 of 57\nWilliams, 553 U.S. 285, 294 (2008))). “Regulate” here means directly controlling the quantity or \nthe quality of imports, not the revenue raised thereby. Indeed, where Congress intended for the \nPresident to have the power to confiscate funds or other property under IEEPA, it said so clearly. \n50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1) (authorizing President to “confiscate” and sell foreign property under \ndefined circumstances). \nSecond, a contrary interpretation would mean any statute granting any agency the authority \nto “regulate” would also give that agency the authority to impose fees, taxes, or other revenue-\nraising devices upon the American public to achieve its policy goals. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 7412 \n(authorizing  the  Environmental  Protection  Agency  to  “promulgate  regulations  establishing \nemissions standards”). Courts have never understood the term so broadly. See National Cable \nTelevision Ass’n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 337 (1974) (holding that Congress must state \nclearly its intent to delegate to an agency the authority to impose fees on regulated industries). \nThird, interpreting the word “regulate” to grant limitless tariff-levying authority would \nundermine Congress’s trade laws more broadly. Because the tariff power ultimately belongs to \nCongress, the Executive may exercise delegated authority only “subject to limitations which \n[Congress] imposes.” Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979). As explained below, \nevery time Congress grants the President the authority to levy “duties” in Title 19, it pairs that \npermission with various limits on that delegated levying authority. E.g., 19 U.S.C. § 2132(a) \n(granting the President the power to “deal with” “balance-of-payments deficits” by levying “a \ntemporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem,” “for a period not exceeding \n150 days”). Yet that statutory limitation, and every other, would be rendered meaningless if the \nPresident were permitted to bypass the tailored provisions Congress enacted by relying on IEEPA. \nSee RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (noting the \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 34 of 57\n“commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general”). Especially given \nthat  “Congress  has  enacted  a  comprehensive  scheme  and  has  deliberately  targeted  specific \nproblems with specific solutions,” id. (citations omitted), IEEPA cannot be read as effectively \nsubsuming them all.   \nFinally, interpreting the grant of authority to “regulate” imports and exports to include the \nauthority to impose tariffs would be inconsistent with IEEPA’s other textual limits. Under the \nrelevant provision, the President may only “regulate . . . importation or exportation of . . . property \nin which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest.” 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B) \n(emphasis added). In other words, the President’s authority is limited to property owned at least in \npart by foreign countries and citizens; he cannot regulate property wholly owned by an American \nnational. But the Challenged Orders do exactly that: They impose tariffs on property owned alone \nby  American  nationals,  like  Plaintiffs.  See  Woldenberg  Decl  ¶ 5;  see  also  19  U.S.C. \n§ 1484(a)(2)(B) (defining “importer of record” as the “owner or purchaser of the merchandise”). \nNo surprise, then, that it is frequently American nationals—and not any foreign country or \nnational—that are responsible for paying such tariffs. See Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 8 (IEEPA tariffs \nprojected to cost Plaintiffs over $100 million). Because the statute’s plain text makes clear that it \ndoes not empower the President to tax property held by Americans, IEEPA provides no support \nfor the Challenged Orders’ tariffs. \n3. Historical practice confirms that IEEPA does not authorize tariffs.  \nSince IEEPA was enacted nearly half a century ago, none of the eight different presidential \nadministrations (four from each major political party) had ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs prior \nto this one. Instead, those administrations have relied on other statutes (actual tariff statutes) to do \nso. IEEPA’s enactment against that backdrop further demonstrates it was not intended to authorize \ntariffs.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 35 of 57\nTrading with the Enemy Act and Trade Act of 1974: The relevant language in IEEPA \noriginated in amendments made to the Trading with the Enemy Act mere days after the attack on \nPearl Harbor. Although those wartime amendments were broad in many ways, the relevant \nlanguage was not used by the President to impose or adjust tariffs in the decades that followed its \npassage. When President Nixon declared a national emergency to “strengthen the international \neconomic position of the United States” in 1971, decoupled the dollar from gold, and imposed a \nsurcharge on imports to address a balance of payments issue, he notably relied upon the Tariff Act \nof 1930 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, not the Trading with the Enemy Act. See \nProclamation No. 4074, 36 Fed. Reg. 15,724, 15,724 (Aug. 17, 1971). He lifted that surcharge \nafter less than five months, Proclamation No. 4098, 36 Fed. Reg. 24,201 (Dec. 22, 1971), and later \nasked Congress to give him more authority to negotiate tariffs to address “deficits in our trading \nbalance” and to “raise or lower import restrictions on a temporary basis to help correct deficits or \nsurpluses in our payments position,” Special Message to the Congress Proposing Trade Reform \nLegislation, 1973 PUB.PAPERS 258, 261, 266 (Apr. 10, 1973).  \nPresident Nixon’s request ultimately led to the passage of the Trade Act of 1974, which set \nforth new specific authorities for the President to use in negotiating tariff agreements, outlined \npriorities for those agreements, and explained procedures for obtaining congressional approval of \nthem. Pub. L. No. 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978 (1975). That law gave the President the requested authority \nto impose tariffs to address “balance-of-payments deficits.” Id. § 122 (codified at 19 U.S.C. \n§ 2132(a)). In addition, it granted him authority to “respon[d] to certain trade practices of foreign \ngovernments,” including by imposing “duties or other import restrictions.” Id. § 301(a) (codified \nas amended at 19 U.S.C. § 2411). But as noted, those grants of authority came with procedural and \nsubstantive limits. The President’s authority to impose tariffs with respect to balance-of-payments \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 36 of 57\ndeficits was limited to “a temporary import surcharge, not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem” for \n“a period not exceeding 150 days.” Id. § 122. And the power to impose duties to respond to foreign \ntrade practices was limited to a single country at a time, and only after a determination that the \ncountry “maintains unjustifiable or unreasonable tariff or other import restrictions” or “engages in \ndiscriminatory” policies that “restrict United States commerce.” Id. § 301.Moreover, the President \nwas required to provide “an opportunity for the presentation of views” as well as “appropriate \npublic hearings” (if requested by “any interested party”) before imposing any tariffs. Id.20\nSuch limits were consistent with previous grants of authority for the President to impose \nduties. The Tariff Act of 1930 granted the President the authority to “declare new or additional \nduties” on imports, but only from countries that the President “finds” have (a) imposed an \n“unreasonable charge, exaction, regulation, or limitation” on U.S. products which is “not equally \nenforced upon the like articles of every foreign country,” or (b) “[d]iscriminat[ed] in fact against \nthe commerce of the United States . . . in such manner as to place the commerce of the United \nStates at a disadvantage compared with the commerce of any foreign country.” Tariff Act of 1930, \n46 Stat. 590, 704, § 338(a) (codified at 19 U.S.C. § 1338(a)). The tariffs under this provision, \nmoreover, may not exceed fifty percent and cannot take effect for thirty days. Id. § 1338(d), (e). \nSection 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, titled “Safeguarding national security,” likewise \nlimits the President’s ability to impose tariffs only against specific products. And it, too, imposes \nprocedural hurdles, including requiring the Secretary of Commerce to conduct an “investigation” \nto determine whether an article of commerce is “being imported into the United States in such \nquantities  .  .  .  as  to  threaten  to  impair  national  security,”  publish  a  report  regarding  that \n20 Section 301 has since been amended in numerous ways, but never to remove critical limits \non the President’s authority to impose tariffs. See 19 U.S.C. § 2411. \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 37 of 57\ninvestigation for the President to consider, and, together with the President, consider “the capacity \nof domestic industries.” Trade Expansion Act of 1962, Pub. L. No. 87-794, § 232, 76 Stat. 872 \n(codified as amended at 19 U.S.C. § 1862). The statute further requires the President to submit a \nseparate written statement to Congress, explaining the reasons why he has decided to take any \naction or declined to do so. Id. § 226, 76 Stat. at 876. \nNone  of  these  developments  suggests  that  Congress—or,  for  that  matter,  President \nNixon—thought the President already had the unilateral and unconstrained power to adjust tariffs \nunder the Trading with the Enemy Act, and certainly not for the purpose of addressing trade \ndeficits. If President Nixon did, there is little reason that he would have asked Congress for the \nTrade Act or that Congress would have gone to the trouble of passing it.  \nCongress passes IEEPA to limit emergency authority: Three years later, Congress acted \nagain, this time in response to a separate concern that presidents had been exercising emergency \npowers based on declarations of national emergency that persisted for too many years. See Sacks \nv. Office of Foreign Assets Control, 466 F.3d 764, 776 (9th Cir. 2006) (“The IEEPA was passed \nby Congress to counter the perceived abuse of emergency controls by presidents to . . . interfere \nwith international trade in non-emergency, peacetime situations.”). Congress removed certain \nnational  emergency  powers  under  the  Trading  with  the  Enemy  Act  and  imposed  temporal \nlimitations on actions already taken by the President pursuant to its authorities. Congress then \nadopted IEEPA. It borrowed language from the Trading with the Enemy Act authorizing the \nPresident, “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise,” to “regulate . . . importation or \nexportation of . . . any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has any interest[,] \nby any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States,” but \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 38 of 57\nit imposed additional restrictions on that language’s use. Pub. L. No. 95-223, § 203, 91 Stat. 1625 \n(1977) (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1702).  \nFor example, Congress provided that IEEPA authority could “only be exercised to deal \nwith an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been \ndeclared for purposes of th[e] title and may not be exercised for any other purpose”; that such \n“unusual and extraordinary threat” must “ha[ve] its source in whole or substantial part outside the \nUnited States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States”; and that \nthe exercise of the authorities to deal with any new threat requires a “new declaration of national \nemergency.” Pub. L. No. 95-223, § 202, 91 Stat. 1625 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1701). \nFurther, Congress required the President “in every possible instance” to “consult with the Congress \nbefore exercising any of the authorities granted by th[e] title,” to “consult regularly with the \nCongress so long as such authorities are exercised,” and to file certain reports to Congress about \nthe President’s actions. Id. § 204 (codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1703). IEEPA was thus an \nexercise in constraining the statutory powers granted to the President in national emergencies, and \nit arose after Congress had already specifically delineated the President’s authority to adjust tariffs \nin the Trade Act of 1974.  \nTo be sure, between the passage of those two Acts, the government had argued (and the \nCourt of Customs and Patent Appeals had accepted) the proposition that President Nixon’s 1971 \ntariffs could be justified under the Trading with the Enemy Act, despite the fact that no President \nhad previously claimed such authority and President Nixon himself had not cited it as a basis for \nhis authority in the Proclamation (or the Proclamation rescinding the imposition of the tariffs). \nUnited States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d 560, 577 (C.C.P.A. 1975). For the reasons already \nexplained, that single court’s analysis—in conflict with the earlier decision of the three-judge \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 39 of 57\ncustoms court, Yoshida Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 378 F. Supp. 1155, 1171 (Cust. Ct. 1974)—was \nwrong to conclude that the statutory power to “regulate” encompassed the power to impose tariffs. \nAnd as a practical matter, the government’s position and the court’s decision were overtaken by \nevents. The Trade Act of 1974 was now a specific authorization by Congress for the President to \nnegotiate tariff agreements subject to congressional approval and, as a temporary matter, to impose \ncertain tariffs to “deal with large and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.” 19 \nU.S.C. § 2132(a).  \nEvery President since then accordingly has understood that IEEPA is not a source of tariff-\nimposing authority. Where Presidents (including, until recently, President Trump) have imposed \ntariffs, they have done so through laws other than IEEPA. The President himself admits that, \nhistorically, Congress has “directed the President to secure reduced reciprocal tariff rates from key \ntrading partners first through bilateral trade agreements,” not through emergency tariffs issued \nunder IEEPA. Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,041. And the President \nhas repeatedly relied on other laws to impose tariffs on China, steel, and aluminum, including in \nhis second Term. See, e.g., Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Restores Section 232 Tariffs, \nTHE WHITE HOUSE (Feb. 11, 2025) (relying on Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962)21; \nProclamation No. 9704, 83 Fed.

Supreme Court precedent requires a clear, not merely colorable, statutory \nbasis for the challenged tariffs. \nWhere “the interpretation of [a] provision [is] a question of deep economic and political \nsignificance that is central to [the] statutory scheme,” courts do “not assume that Congress” \ndelegated that function “without a clear statement to that effect.” Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, \n505-506  (2023)  (third  alteration  in  original)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  Because \nDefendants have “discover[ed]” a previously “unheralded power” to impose tariffs under IEEPA, \nthe Supreme Court (including through the “major questions” doctrine) requires them to point to a \n“clear,” not merely “colorable,” statutory basis for this power. West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 722-724. \nThe government cannot make that showing.  \nAs explained, “the Executive Branch interpretation” from the time of “enactment of the \nstatute,” Loper Bright Enters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 386 (2024), uniformly has been that \nIEEPA authorizes targeted economic sanctions on the persons or governments directly responsible \nfor the external threat to American national security. It has never been invoked to authorize tariffs. \nThat interpretation has “remained consistent over time,” establishing a “longstanding practice of \nthe government.” Id. (quoting NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.S. 513, 525 (2014) (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)). The longstanding practice is strong evidence that IEEPA does not, as the \ngovernment now claims, grant the Executive Branch authority to impose tariffs. Indeed, “the lack \nof historical precedent, coupled with the breadth of authority that the [President] now claims, is a \ntelling indication that the [tariffs] extend[] beyond the [President’s] legitimate reach.” NFIB, 595 \nU.S. at 119 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nMoreover, “[t]he ‘economic and political significance’ of the” President’s newfound tariff \nauthority is “staggering by any measure.” Biden, 600 U.S. at 502 (citation omitted). As for \neconomic significance, these tariffs will affect trillions of dollars of imports, lower America’s GDP \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 41 of 57\n($27.7 trillion) by almost a full percentage point, put countless jobs in jeopardy, and cost the \naverage American well over $1,000 per year. See supra pp. 12-14. And the political significance \nis equally seismic, given the undisputed lack of limits on the President’s asserted authority. These \ntariffs,  if  not  enjoined,  could  continue  for  years.  Or,  alternatively,  they  could  be  paused, \neliminated, or substantially increased on a moment’s notice—which the President has already done \nmultiple times, days after issuing them. See, e.g., April 9 Reciprocal Modification, §§ 2, 3, 90 Fed. \nReg. at 15,626; Exec. Order No. 14,198, Progress on the Situation at Our Southern Border, 90 \nFed. Reg. 9,185 (Feb. 3, 2025). This represents an unprecedented and “unheralded power,” Utility \nAir Regul. Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014), to inflict billions (if not trillions) of dollars of \ncumulative economic costs on American businesses and to inject (repeatedly) massive uncertainty \nand volatility in domestic and global markets. If the Challenged Orders are upheld, the President \nwould “enjoy virtually unlimited power to rewrite” U.S. domestic economic and international trade \npolicy whenever and however he chooses. Biden, 600 U.S. at 502. \nThe  assertion  of  such  a  “transformative  expansion  in”  the  President’s  “authority” \nconstitutes a “major question[].” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 724 (quotation marks and citation \nomitted). The Supreme Court has held that the CDC’s claim of authority to impose an eviction \nmoratorium with an “economic impact” of approximately “$50 billion” was a major question. \nAlabama Ass’n of Realtors, 594 U.S. at 764; see also NFIB, 595 U.S. at 117 (claimed authority to \norder “84 million Americans to either obtain a COVID-19 vaccine or undergo weekly medical \ntesting”  also  a  major  question).  In  Biden  v.  Nebraska,  the  Court  found  that  “a  new \nprogram affecting 43 million Americans and $430 billion in federal debt” “triggered analysis under \nthe major questions doctrine.” 600 U.S. at 496, 502-503. The Secretary of Education was claiming \nauthority  over  “nearly  one-third  of  the  Government’s  $1.7  trillion  in  annual  discretionary \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 42 of 57\nspending,” which plainly constituted “a significant portion of the American economy.” Id. at 503 \n(citation omitted). And the EPA’s rule in West Virginia, which would have imposed “billions of \ndollars in compliance costs” and “reduce[d] GDP by at least a trillion 2009 dollars by 2040” \nconstituted a “major question[].” 597 U.S. at 714-715, 724. The Challenged Orders, which are \nprojected to increase federal revenues by more than $2 trillion over the next decade while reducing \nU.S. GDP by .8 percent, York & Durante, supra p. 14,fall comfortably within those precedents. \nIn short, if ever there were a “major question,” this is it.Sothere must be undeniably “clear \ncongressional authorization,” not “a merely plausible textual basis,” for the authority claimed. \nWest Virginia, 597 U.S. at 723. IEEPA fails that test. Not one word in IEEPA or its history suggests \nCongress intended to authorize the President to impose hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs to \nreshape American trade policy wholesale. And “[i]t would be anomalous,” to say the least, “for \nCongress to have so painstakingly described the [President’s] limited authority” on tariffs in so \nmany other statutes, “but to have given him, just by implication,” essentially unlimited authority \non that topic in another statute. Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 262 (2006). The President’s \nassertion of authority here would “transform the carefully described limits on the [President’s] \nauthority” over tariffs in all those other laws into “mere suggestions.” Id. at 260-261. It is not \nplausible Congress made that choice.  \nB. Even if IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs, these tariffs are \nunlawful.  \nWhen Congress enacted IEEPA, it included four important limits on when and how the \nPresident could invoke the statute’s authority. First, Congress provided that any authority granted \nto the President under IEEPA may be exercised only to address an “unusual and extraordinary \nthreat . . . to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States.” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1701(a). Second, Congress was explicit that the President’s action must “deal with”—or in other \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 43 of 57\nwords, be related to—that threat. Id. Third, Congress required that IEEPA authority be exercised \nonly with respect to the national emergency that has been declared “and may not be exercised for \nany other purpose.” Id. § 1701(b). “Any exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat \nshall be based on a new declaration of national emergency which must be with respect to such \nthreat.” Id.Fourth, Congress made clear that actions taken to regulate the importation of property \ncould only be with respect to “property in which a[] foreign country or a national thereof has an[] \ninterest.” Id. § 1702(a)(1)(B). \nEven if this Court were to conclude that IEEPA authorizes the President to impose tariffs, \nit should hold that the overall tariffs adopted by President Trump are inconsistent with the first \nthree of these requirements. At the very least, it should hold that as applied to the property of \nPlaintiffs—who are American nationals—the challenged tariffs are inconsistent with the fourth \nrequirement. \n1. The Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order violates the statute. \nThe Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order violates IEEPA in at least two ways. First, it \nis not based on “any unusual and extraordinary threat” as defined by the statute. 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1701(a). Instead, President Trump declared a national emergency due to “persistent annual U.S. \ngoods trade deficits.” Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,044 (emphasis \nadded). Longstanding trade deficits are neither unusual nor extraordinary. Under common usage, \n“unusual” means “[n]ot usual” “rare,” “exceptional,” or “remarkable.” Unusual, NEW WEBSTER’S \nDICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE at 1698, supra p. 18; Unusual, THE CONCISE OXFORD \nDICTIONARY OF CURRENT ENGLISH at 1277, supra p. 18. “Extraordinary” means” “[b]eyond an \nordinary, common, usual, or customary order, method, or course; exceeding a common degree or \nmeasure; exceptional.” Extraordinary, NEW WEBSTER’S DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE\nat 548, supra p. 18; see also Extraordinary, THE CONCISE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF CURRENT \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 44 of 57\nENGLISH at 368, supra p. 18 (“[o]ut of the usual course” or “[e]xceptional, surprising; unusually \ngreat”).  IEEPA’s  language  “emphasizes  that  such  powers  should  be  available  only  in  true \nemergencies.” Revision of the Trading with the Enemy Act: Markup Before the H. Comm. on \nInternational Relations, 95th Cong. 12 (1977) (statement of Hon. C. Fred Bergsten, Assistant \nSec’y for Int’l Affs. Dep’t of the Treasury). \nIn fact, responding to “true emergencies” was the entire purpose for the enactment of \nIEEPA. Congress knew that in such emergencies, a President may need to act without waiting for \nCongress. But when the President has time to “consult with the Congress before exercising” his \nemergency powers, he must do so. 50 U.S.C. § 1703(a). And, to prevent a President from relying \non a national emergency that persists for years, the President must “immediately transmit to \nCongress a report” explaining why the emergency “necessitate[s] such exercise of authority” and \nwhy the actions he chose “are necessary to deal with those circumstances.” Id. § 1703(b). If there \nis no unusual or extraordinary emergency—or if the emergency powers are not “necessary to deal \nwith those circumstances”—the President does not have any power under IEEPA. \nThere is nothing exceptional, uncommon, or rare about the United States’s global trade \ndeficit. The President himself admits that “annual trade deficits” are “persistent” and have their \nroots in post-World War II trade agreements. Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order, 90 Fed. Reg. \nat 15,041. In fact, the United States has had a trade deficit for more than 50 years—since before \nIEEPA’s enactment. See Brian Reinbold & Yi Wen, Historical U.S. Trade Deficit, FED. RSRV.\nBANK OF ST. LOUIS (May 17, 2019).23 A “persistent” 50-year-old problem is antithetical to \nIEEPA’s textual requirements for a national emergency. Such “emergencies are by their nature \nrare and brief, and are not to be equated with normal, ongoing problems.” H. REP.NO. 95-459, at \n23 https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2019/may/historical-u-s-trade-deficits. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 45 of 57\n10 (1977). Nor is the trade deficit somehow “exceptionally” high. To the contrary, the recent trade \ndeficit has been less than half the historic high (5.8 percent of GDP) from 2006. JAMES K.\nJACKSON, R45243, CONG. RSCH. SERV., TRADE DEFICITS AND U.S. TRADE POLICY 3-4 (2018) \n(citing  data  published  by  the  Census  Bureau  and  Bureau  of  Economic  Analysis);24 U.S. \nInternational Trade in Goods and Services, December 2024, Release Nos. CB 25-17, BEA 25-04 \nat 5, U.S. DEP’T OF COM. (Feb. 5, 2025) (reporting the 2024 trade deficit was 3.1 percent of GDP, \na marginal increase from the 2023 trade deficit of 2.9 percent of GDP).25\nGiven the trade-deficit  justification fails  to satisfy IEEPA’s text at every turn, it is \nunsurprising that this purported emergency is categorically different from every other emergency \nused as a predicate for action under IEEPA. IEEPA is typically directed at foreign governments \nand actors to address terrorism, foreign criminal organizations, and rogue states. See, e.g., Exec. \nOrder No. 13,224, Blocking Property and Prohibiting Transactions With Persons Who Commit, \nThreaten To Commit, or Support Terrorism, 66 Fed. Reg. 49,079 (Sept. 23, 2001). The President’s \nuse of IEEPA to address the trade deficit is thus a drastic break from historical practice and any \nreasonable understanding of its scope. \nSecond, the Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order violates IEEPA because the tariffs \nimposed by it are not “reasonably related” to the trade-deficit emergency the President declared. \nCf. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d at 577 (interpreting similar language under Trading with the \nEnemy Act); id. at 578-579, 583-84 (President has only “the power to regulate importation during \ndeclared national emergencies by means appropriate to the emergency involved”). Section 1702 \nof the statute makes clear that the President’s authorities to take IEEPA action are only “to the \n24 https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R45243. \n25 https://perma.cc/VUH7-BWQX.  \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 46 of 57\nextent specified in section 1701.” Section 1701, in turn, provides that the President may exercise \nIEEPA authority only to “deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a \nnational emergency has been declared” and not “for any other purpose.” Together, those provisions \nrequire that the President’s actions (here, imposing tariffs) be tailored to address the specific threat \nidentified (trade deficits). \nThe tariffs imposed by the Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order lack that nexus. Even \nassuming tariffs could reduce the trade deficit, the tariffs the President announced are vastly \noverbroad. The President has imposed 10 percent tariffs “on all imports from all trading partners.” \nUniversal and Reciprocal Tariff Order, § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045. But the United States runs a \ntrade surplus with over 100 countries. See U.S. DEP’T OF COM. at. Ex. 4 (Supplement), supra p. 32 \n(collecting annual data for 2024). For example, the United States had a $55 billion trade surplus \nwith the Netherlands in 2025, a $19 billion trade surplus with the United Arab Emirates, and an \n$18 billion trade surplus with Australia. Id. These countries reduce the overall U.S. trade deficit, \nbut the President imposed universal tariffs on them anyway. Relatedly, the President imposed \n“reciprocal” tariffs on countries, such as Israel, that have dropped all tariffs on the United States. \nSee Steven Scheer, Israel eliminates remaining tariffs on US goods ahead of Trump move, \nREUTERS (April 1, 2025).26\n2. The China IEEPA Orders violate the statute.  \nThe China IEEPA Orders likewise violate IEEPA. The tariffs imposed by those orders are \nnot reasonably related to the declared fentanyl emergency. In those orders, the President relied on \n26 https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israel-finmin-seeks-immediate-end-remaining-\ntariffs-us-imports-2025-04-01/. \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 47 of 57\nthe “sustained influx of illicit opioids” as a national emergency requiring the imposition of tariffs.27\nBut imposing tariffs on legal goods has no sufficient connection to combatting illegal narcotics. \nMost critically, the costs of tariffs on legal goods lawfully imported into the United States are \nprimarily borne by Americans; there is no reason why such tariffs and the corresponding harm to \nAmerican  business  will  alter  the  behavior  of  the  cartels,  drug-smuggling  rings,  and  other \norganizations that bring illegal substances into our country. Such an indirect and instrumental use \nof tariffing authority is certainly not “regulat[ing] importation . . . by means appropriate to the \nemergency involved.” Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 584 (emphasis added). \nNor can the lack of any reasonable connection between the tariffs and drug trafficking be \nresolved by pointing to other policy objectives that the President may hope to achieve. The statute \nis explicit that the President can take IEEPA action only with respect to the national emergency \nthat he has declared. 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b) (authorizing the President to take action only to “deal \nwith an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been \ndeclared” (emphasis added)). And that action “may not be exercised for any other purpose.” Id. \n(emphasis added).  \nBut the President has stated repeatedly that his imposition of tariffs under IEEPA serves \npurposes other than the declared emergency. The day before announcing the February 1, 2025, \ntariffs on China, he described the reasons for the tariffs as: “pure economic. We have big deficits \nwith, as you know, with [China].” Amie Williams et al., Donald Trump Threatens to Ignite Era of \nTrade Wars with New Tariffs, FIN.TIMES (Jan. 31, 2025).28 The day after announcing those tariffs \non China, he wrote: “USA has major deficits with . . . China” and the “United States lose[s] \n27 February 1 China Order (referencing “the sustained influx of synthetic opioids” when \nannouncing tariffs on China).  \n28 https://www.ft.com/content/ff8116f0-b01f-4687-934a-a1b8a07bd5b0. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 48 of 57\nTRILLION  OF  DOLLARS  IN  SUBSIDIZING  OTHER  COUNTRIES.”  Donald  J.  Trump \n(@realDonaldTrump), TRUTH SOCIAL (Feb. 2, 2025, 8:09 AM).29 And these are just some in a \nlong line of statements from the President about how to use tariffs to accomplish economic policy \ngoals, including revenue raising. According to President Trump, “[t]ariffs are going to be a really \nimportant part of the tax-cut discussion.” Jared Renshaw, et al., Trump push to use tariffs to pay \nfor tax cuts faces opposition in Congress, REUTERS (Jan. 22, 2025).30 They are also ways to make \nother countries pay “their fair share,” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), TRUTH SOCIAL (Jan. \n14, 2025, 11:28 AM),31 while making the United States “rich,” Donald Trump Press Conference \nwith Softbank CEO (Dec. 16, 2024).32 And if companies decide not to make products in America \nthen they “will have to pay a tariff” on their exports, “which will direct hundreds of billions of \ndollars and even trillions of dollars into our Treasury.” Remarks by President Trump at the World \nEconomic Forum, THE WHITE HOUSE (Jan. 23, 2025).33\nThe  President’s  multi-purpose  approach  renders  IEEPA’s  text  superfluous.  IEEPA \nexpressly limits the President’s authority to “deal[ing] with an unusual and extraordinary threat \nwith respect to which a national emergency has been declared” and not “for any other purpose.” \n50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). If he can exercise powers under IEEPA for any purpose—i.e., take action \nother than to “deal with” with the declared emergency—the textual limit set by Congress has no \nforce or meaning. \n29 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113934450227067577. \n30  https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-push-use-tariffs-pay-tax-cuts-faces-opposition-\ncongress-2025-01-22/. \n31 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113827650534234057. \n32  https://www.rev.com/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-with-softbank-ceo-12-16-\n24. \n33  https://www.whitehouse.gov/remarks/2025/01/remarks-by-president-trump-at-the-world-\neconomic-forum/. \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 49 of 57\n3.

Under IEEPA, the only \nproperty the President may regulate is “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof \nhas any interest.” 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B); see supra p. 21. But no foreign country or national \nhas any interest in Plaintiffs’ property at the time that property is subject to challenged tariffs. \nPlaintiffs, who are American nationals, “purchase and take title to the products in the foreign \ncountry and thus own the merchandise at the time of importation.” Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 5. Thus, \nthe property is wholly owned by Plaintiff at the time the property is subject to the challenged \ntariffs. It is a plain violation of IEEPA’s text to subject such American-held property to the \nChallenged Orders. \nC. If  IEEPA  authorizes  these  tariffs,  it  is  an  unconstitutional  delegation  of \nCongress’s legislative power. \nTo the extent any doubt remains regarding the proper interpretation of IEEPA, principles \nof constitutional avoidance should eliminate it. See Gonzalez v. United States, 553 U.S. 242, 251 \n(2008) (“[W]hen ‘a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful \nconstitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided,’” the court’s \n“duty is to adopt the latter.” (citations omitted)). Even if just “‘a serious doubt’ is raised about the \nconstitutionality of an Act of Congress, ‘it is a cardinal principle that this Court will first ascertain \nwhether a construction of the statute is fairly possible by which the question may be avoided.’” \nJennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 296 (2018) (emphasis added) (citation omitted).  \nThe  President’s  interpretation  raises  far  more  than  a  “serious  doubt”  about  its \nconstitutionality. If Congress had truly granted the President the authority to unilaterally impose \ntariffs that remake the global economy, without any restrictions other than the President’s power \nto declare an “emergency,” then that grant of authority would amount to an unconstitutional \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 50 of 57\ndelegation of legislative power. Under Supreme Court precedent, any grant of legislative authority \nto the Executive must be accompanied by an “intelligible principle” to guide the Executive’s \ndiscretion. Whitman v. American Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001) (quoting J.W. \nHampton, Jr., & Co., 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). As noted above, the Challenged Orders are \npredicated on the idea that IEEPA authorizes the President “to exercise an unfettered discretion” \nto take whatever action he believes “may be needed or advisable” on tariffs. A.L.A. Schechter, 295 \nU.S. at 537-538. Under the Executive Branch’s view of IEEPA, there is no limiting guidance, \ninstruction, or restrictions from Congress about the products on which the President may impose \ntariffs; which country or countries the President may target; the permissible amount or range of \nthe tariff; the duration of the tariff; the process that the President must use to make any of those \ndecisions; the nature of the emergency sufficient to invoke the statute; or the relationship between \nthe action taken and the emergency declared. Everything is at the President’s discretion. \nWorse yet, the President’s usurpation of Congress’s exclusive tariffing power means he \nmay suspend and resume tariffs at will. The President has repeatedly announced tariffs, then \nsuspended them days (or hours) later. He has also abruptly exempted certain countries or products. \nThis “conception of Presidential authority smacks of the powers that English monarchs claimed \nprior to the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, namely, the power to suspend the operation of existing \nstatutes, and to grant dispensations from compliance with statutes.” United States v. Texas, 599 \nU.S. 670, 732 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting).  \nIn these circumstances, it is the court’s “duty” to interpret IEEPA in such a way as to avoid \nthese serious non-delegation doctrine concerns. Gonzalez, 553 U.S. at 251; see, e.g., Industrial \nUnion Dep’t, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Inst., 448 U.S. 607, 646 (1980) (plurality op.) \n(rejecting statutory construction that would “make such a sweeping delegation of legislative power \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 51 of 57\nthat it might be unconstitutional under the Court’s reasoning in” A.L.A. Schechter Poultry and \nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388 (1935) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \nII. PLAINTIFFS WILL SUFFER IRREPARABLE HARM UNLESS THIS COURT \nISSUES A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.  \nA preliminary injunction is necessary because Plaintiffs will suffer—and are already \nbeginning to suffer—“certain, imminent, and unrecoverable” losses because of the tariffs pending \ncompletion of this litigation. Texas Children’s Hosp. v. Burwell, 76 F. Supp. 3d 224, 242 (D.D.C. \n2014). Most of the economic harm caused by the tariffs is also irreparable because “sovereign \nimmunity will bar recovery” for that harm. Everglades Harvesting & Hauling, Inc. v. Scalia, 427 \nF. Supp. 3d 101, 115 (D.D.C. 2019); see also Ohio v. EPA, 603 U.S. 279, 291-292 (2024) (staying \nan EPA rule after explaining that government policy will place companies at a “competitive \ndisadvantage” and impose other “nonrecoverable” costs (citing Thunder Basin Coal Co. v. Reich, \n510 U.S. 200, 220-221 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)); \nChamber of Com. of U.S. v. Edmondson, 594 F.3d 742, 770-771 (10th Cir. 2010) (“Imposition of \nmonetary  damages  that  cannot  later  be  recovered  for  reasons  such  as  sovereign  immunity \nconstitutes irreparable injury”); Feinerman v. Bernardi, 558 F. Supp. 2d 36, 51 (D.D.C. 2008) \n(“[W]here, as here, the plaintiff in question cannot recover damages from the defendant due to the \ndefendant’s sovereign immunity any loss of income suffered by a plaintiff is irreparable per se.” \n(citation omitted)). \nThe loss of “business opportunities, market share, and customer good-will”—all of which \nare unrecoverable from the federal government (including in any potential refund action)—are \nirreparable harms. Air Transp. Ass’n of Am., Inc. v. Export-Import Bank of the U.S., 840 F. Supp. \n2d 327, 335 (D.D.C. 2012); see also Nalco Co. v. EPA, 786 F. Supp. 2d 177, 188 (D.D.C. 2011) \n(finding  irreparable  harm  where  petitioner  would  “suffer  the  loss  of  ‘[l]ong-standing \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 52 of 57\nclients . . . [that may be] unwilling, or unable, to do business’” with them absent an injunction \n(alterations and ellipsis in original)); Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Hous. & Urban Dev., 963 F. \nSupp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (“damage to [a company’s] business reputation” can be “irreparable \nharm”); Everglades Harvesting & Hauling, Inc., 427 F. Supp. 3d at 116 (holding that “severe \nreputational harm” will “almost certainly be irreparable”). “[S]ignificant lay-off, capital, and \nfacility costs” qualify, too. Express One Int’l, Inc. v. U.S. Postal Serv., 814 F. Supp. 87, 91 (D.D.C. \n1992); see McGregor Printing Corp. v. Kemp, No. 91-cv-3255(GHR), 1992 WL 118794, at *5 \n(D.D.C. May 14, 1992) (“[I]rretrievable monetary loss to [Plaintiff] in combination with the loss \nin employment to its employees constitutes a sufficient showing of irreparable harm to warrant a \nstay.”). \nPlaintiffs are suffering these forms of irreparable harm. With the announcement of the \nincreased 125 percent reciprocal tariff rate on China, Plaintiffs stopped as many shipments from \nChina as possible because they would be unable to absorb or pass along the costs. Woldenberg \nDecl. ¶ 7. The tariffs increase the cost of importing the goods Plaintiffs sell by millions of dollars \nmany times over. Plaintiffs predict that attempting to pay the tariffs in 2025 would cost their \nbusinesses $100million in cash expenditures, compared with just $2.3 million in 2024—a 44-fold \nincrease. Id. ¶ 8. Plaintiffs cannot absorb the costs of these increased tariffs. Even if Plaintiffs cut \nevery expense in their 2025 budget other than salary, they still would not be able to cover the $100 \nmillion projected cost of the now-astronomical IEEPA tariffs. Id. ¶ 14. Plaintiffs cannot simply \nshift those high costs on to their customers, who have revolted the few times Plaintiffs have issued \nunscheduled price increases in the last decade. Id. ¶ 18. Nor can Plaintiffs source or manufacture \ntheir products domestically as a practical matter. After several years of efforts to date, Plaintiffs \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 53 of 57\nstill have not found even one qualified and willing U.S. vendor capable of making their non-print \nproducts. Id. ¶ 23. \nGiven that Plaintiffs source roughly 2,400 products from China, it is no surprise that \nPlaintiffs have already lost specific business opportunities, including cancellations and “stop \nshipment” instructions for direct import orders totaling more than $1 million, as well as customers’ \nrefusals to take direct import shipments from China given the tariff risk. Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 10. \nThose harms are only projected to grow. For 2025, Plaintiffs are now predicting a 25 percent to 50 \npercent decline in sales year-over-year, compared to their original projection of an 8 percent rise \nin sales. Id. ¶ 11. Plaintiffs are also projecting significant stock outages of their product—a \n“looming sharp service decline” that will damage the high-service reputation Plaintiffs built up \nover decades. Id. ¶ 10. Devastatingly, Plaintiffs do not have sufficient on-hand inventory to carry \nthem and their customers through the 2025 holiday season, the most important sales season of the \nyear for Plaintiffs. Id. ¶ 21. Customers have already inquired about future shortages and price \nshocks and asked about Plaintiffs’ ability to keep them supplied. Id. ¶ 10. As a result of such \noutages, Plaintiffs will suffer a serious loss in the goodwill of their customers, which include \nparents, teachers, and schools. Id. ¶ 20. \nMost of Plaintiffs’ losses and costs are unrecoverable. An importer may recover from the \nfederal government only the amount of the tariffs that were unlawfully assessed. See 19 U.S.C. \n§ 1505(a)-(b)  (solely  authorizing  “refund[s]”  of  “any  excess”  tariffs  “deposited”  with  the \ngovernment); Transpacific Steel LLC v. United States, 4 F.4th 1306, 1317 (Fed. Cir. 2021) \n(reversing refund of tariffs paid on imported steel bought by steel importer after concluding the \npresident had authority to issue the tariffs); Kalan, Inc. v. United States, 944 F.2d 847, 848 (Fed. \nCir. 1991) (importer of key tags received refund of import duties because items were originally \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 54 of 57\nand incorrectly classified as jewelry, rather than non-dutiable plastics). Sovereign immunity bars \nany monetary recovery beyond that narrow refund action. See Hartog Foods Int’l, Inc. v. United \nStates, 291 F.3d 789, 791 (Fed. Cir. 2002). Plaintiffs will not be able to recover lost profits, lost \ncustomers, or other consequential harms, such as the “additional cost” of finding a “replacement” \nfor high-tariff imports. Carpenters Indus. Council v. Zinke, 854 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2017); see \nVaqueria Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Irizarry, 587 F.3d 464, 485 (1st Cir. 2009) (“[T]he inability to \nsupply a full line of products may irreparably harm a merchant by shifting purchasers to other \nsuppliers.”); Nalco Co., 786 F. Supp. 2d at 188 (agency action that would make it “difficult for \n[the plaintiff] to attract new customers” is “at least some degree of irreparable injury”).  \nNone of these harms are speculative. Practically speaking, there is no way to bring goods \nfrom China into the United States economically. Without the ability to restock goods made in \nChina  this  year  or  instantly  go  into  production  on  hundreds  (or  thousands)  of  products  at \ncompetitive prices elsewhere, Plaintiffs will experience spectacular losses in the short term. Unless \nthe tariffs are enjoined, the company will be forced to take drastic steps in the near future such as \nsharply raising prices (and setting off a customer revolt); refinancing loans on unfavorable terms; \nsignificantly  scaling  back  operations  and  product  offerings;  closing  facilities;  laying  off \nemployees; or even selling businesses now in their third and fourth generation of family ownership. \nWoldenberg Decl. ¶ 28. These are all enormously harmful to Plaintiffs’ long-term financial and \ncorporate health—indeed, their very existence. Although Plaintiffs are taking extraordinary steps \nto avoid these harms, each day that the tariffs remain in place brings them closer to having to adopt \nsuch drastic measures.  \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 55 of 57\nIII. THE REMAINING FACTORS SUPPORT A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. \nFinally, “the balance of the equities tips in [Plaintiffs’] favor,” and “an injunction is in the \npublic interest.” Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. These two factors “merge when the Government is the \nopposing party.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nA preliminary injunction would protect Plaintiffs from significant and irreparable harm, \nsupra pp. 38-41, while costing the federal Government only a temporary delay of its preferred \npolicy as directed to Plaintiffs. Cf. Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (“The \nprimary purpose of a preliminary injunction is . . . to preserve the status quo.” (internal quotation \nmarks and citation omitted)). Indeed, the President has—on his own volition—repeatedly paused \nvarious tariff orders, including pausing reciprocal tariffs as to over 50 countries for three months. \nSee, e.g., April 9 Reciprocal Modification §§ 2, 3, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,626 (pausing for 90 days \nreciprocal tariffs on countries other than China). Without a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs will \nbe forced to either immediately pay or continue to pay these unlawful tariffs, or restructure their \nbusiness at significant loss to avoid doing so. Either way, they face ruinous consequences as a \nresult. Injunctive relief is necessary to ensure that Plaintiffs are not forced to sustain significant \nand unrecoverable losses while the merits of this litigation proceed. \nThe public interest further favors a preliminary injunction. “The public interest is served \nwhen the legislation that Congress has enacted is complied with,” American Rivers v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 271 F. Supp. 2d 230, 262 (D.D.C. 2003), and when action is taken “to prevent \nthe violation of a party’s constitutional rights,” Simms v. District of Columbia, 872 F. Supp. 2d 90, \n105 (D.D.C. 2012) (citation omitted); see also Gordon v. Holder, 721 F.3d 638, 653 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (it is “obvious” that “enforcement of an unconstitutional law is always contrary to the public \ninterest”).  \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 9     Filed 04/24/25     Page 56 of 57\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should preliminarily enjoin the agency Defendants and their agents, employees, \nand all persons acting under their direction and control, from taking any action to collect tariffs \nfrom Plaintiffs under the Challenged Orders. \nDated: April 24, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Pratik A.

Action No. 25-cv-01248-RC \nDONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United \nStates, in his official capacity, et al., \nDefendants. \nRESPONSE TO NOTICE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AUTHORITY \nOn May 23, 2025, Defendants filed a Notice of Supplemental Authority regarding a new \ndecision of the Court of International Trade exercising jurisdiction (for the first time in its history) \nover a challenge to tariffs imposed under IEEPA.  See Dkt. No. 31 (discussing Barnes v. United \nStates, No. 25-cv-00043 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 23, 2025)). \nThe Barnes decision—holding that a pro se “private citizen” lacked standing to bring his \nchallenge to “the constitutionality of [IEEPA] tariffs,” Op. 1—does not aid Defendants.  At the \nthreshold, as in the three other IEEPA tariff challenges filed in the CIT, no party contested \njurisdiction.  See Op. 5 (“Plaintiff asserts that this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1581(i), which Defendant does not dispute.”).   \nAlthough Barnes acknowledged that the plaintiff’s challenge arose out of IEEPA, it offered \nzero independent analysis of whether IEEPA in fact “provides for” tariffs (as the plain text of 28 \nU.S.C. § 1581(i) requires).  Instead, Barnes summarily relied on a prior CIT decision exercising \njurisdiction over a challenge to duties previously imposed under TWEA (following Yoshida), \nwithout recognizing that jurisdiction there rested on § 1581(a), not § 1581(i) (as relevant here).  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 32     Filed 05/24/25     Page 2 of 3\nOp. 7-8 (citing Alcan Sales, Div. of Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. United States, 528 F. Supp. 1159, \n1161-1165 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1981) (“[P]laintiff has acknowledged that it does not take issue with \nthe decision of our appellate court in the case of United States v. Yoshida International[.]”), aff’d, \n693 F.2d 1089 (Fed. Cir. 1982)); see also Dkt. No. 18, at 5 & n.3. \nBarnes is a perfect example of why this Court must perform an independent analysis of its \nown jurisdiction and actually determine whether IEEPA “provid[es] for” tariffs.  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1581(i).  Indeed, that was the path this Court and the D.C. Circuit charted in K Mart Corp., with \nthe Supreme Court then affirming this Court’s exercise of jurisdiction and rejecting the CIT’s and \nFederal Circuit’s contrary holdings.  See K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U.S. 176, 182 (1988) \n(“We granted certiorari to resolve conflicts among the Courts of Appeals [including between the \nD.C. Circuit and Federal Circuit] on . . . the jurisdictional issue” and “now affirm . . . that the \nDistrict Court had jurisdiction[.]” (citation omitted)).  This Court must likewise exercise its \nindependent duty to ensure that jurisdiction is determined based on the text of section 1581(i) and \nIEEPA, not a 50-year-old CCPA decision.   \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 32     Filed 05/24/25     Page 3 of 3\nDated: May 24, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Pratik A.

INTRODUCTION \nLearning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. (“Plaintiffs”) are small businesses that \ndevelop educational toys and products for children.  They manufacture most of their products in \nChina, Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and India.  After President Donald Trump invoked \nthe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”), 50 U.S.C. § 1701 et seq., to \nimpose sweeping tariffs on imports from those countries and others, the businesses initiated this \nlawsuit against President Trump and other government officials and agencies (collectively, \n“Defendants”).  They claim that (1) IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs; (2) \neven if it does, it does not authorize the challenged tariffs; (3) the agency actions implementing \nthe tariffs violate the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 701 et seq.; and (4) to the extent \nthat IEPPA can be interpreted to permit the President to impose the challenged tariffs, it violates \nthe nondelegation doctrine.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 2 of 33\nDefendants have moved to transfer this action to the United States Court of International \nTrade, arguing that that court has exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1581(i) and 1337(c).  \nPlaintiffs disagree.  They have also moved for a preliminary injunction.   \nThis case is not about tariffs qua tariffs.  It is about whether IEEPA enables the President \nto unilaterally impose, revoke, pause, reinstate, and adjust tariffs to reorder the global economy.  \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that it does not.  For the reasons discussed below, the Court \ndenies Defendants’ motion to transfer and grants Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction.   \nII.  BACKGROUND \nSix months after the United States entered World War I, Congress passed the Trading \nwith the Enemy Act of 1917 (“TWEA”), which gave the President a broad range of powers over \ninternational trade in times of war and, as amended in 1933, national emergencies.  Pub. L. No. \n65-91, 40 Stat. 411 (1917), codified as amended at 50 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.; Regan v. Wald, 468 \nU.S. 222, 226 n.2 (1984).  The statute had “clear procedures for enhancing the authority of a \nPresident when an emergency arose,” but no analogous procedures for withdrawing or winding \ndown that power.  Regan, 468 U.S. at 245 (Blackmun, J., dissenting).  So, over time, TWEA \ncame to operate as a “one-way ratchet to enhance greatly the President’s discretionary authority \nover foreign policy.”  Id.  \nIn 1977, Congress responded by limiting TWEA’s application “solely to times of war.”  \nId. at 227 (majority opinion); see also 50 U.S.C. § 4302.  It also passed the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act, Pub. L. No. 95-223, 91 Stat. 1626 et seq. (1977), to “counter \nthe perceived abuse of emergency controls by presidents to . . . interfere with international trade \nin non-emergency, peacetime situations.”  Sacks v. Off. of Foreign Assets Control, 466 F.3d 764, \n766 (9th Cir. 2006).  IEEPA regulates the President’s “exercise of emergency economic powers \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 3 of 33\nin response to peacetime crises.”  Regan, 468 U.S. at 227–28 (majority opinion).  It established \n“a new set of authorities for use in time of national emergency which are both more limited in \nscope than those of [TWEA] and subject to various procedural limitations.”  H.R. Rep. No. 95-\n459, “Trading With the Enemy Act Reform Legislation,” at 2 (1977).  \nSection 1701 of IEEPA provides that President can use the statute “to deal with any \nunusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the \nUnited States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,” if he \ndeclares a national emergency “with respect to such threat” pursuant to the National \nEmergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–51.  50 U.S.C. § 1701(a).  The President’s IEEPA powers \n“may not be exercised for any other purpose.”  Id. § 1701(b). \nWhen Section 1701’s conditions are met, Section 1702(a)(1) establishes that the \nPresident may, “by means of instructions, licenses, or otherwise”: \n(A)  investigate, regulate, or prohibit— \n \ni.  any transactions in foreign exchange, \n \nii.  transfers of credit or payments between, by, through, or to any banking \ninstitution, to the extent that such transfers or payments involve any interest \nof any foreign country or a national thereof, \n \niii. the importing or exporting of currency or securities,  \n \nby any person, or with respect to any property, subject to the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States; \n \n(B) investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, regulate, direct and \ncompel,  nullify,  void,  prevent  or  prohibit,  any  acquisition,  holding, \nwithholding,  use,  transfer,  withdrawal,  transportation,  importation  or \nexportation of, or dealing in, or exercising any right, power, or privilege with \nrespect to, or transactions involving, any property in which any foreign country \nor a national thereof has any interest by any person, or with respect to any \nproperty, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States; and[] \n \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 4 of 33\n(C) when the United States is engaged in armed hostilities or has been attacked by \na foreign country or foreign nationals, [take additional actions]. \n \nId. § 1702(a)(1).  \n  Beginning in February 2025, President Trump issued a series of executive orders \ninvoking IEEPA to unilaterally impose tariffs on many foreign goods.  The executive orders used \nthree other statutory provisions to implement the tariffs: the National Emergencies Act; \nSection 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, which authorizes the President to edit the Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States (“HTSUS”); and 3 U.S.C. § 301, which enables the \nPresident to delegate functions to subordinates.  Five of President Trump’s executive orders are \nchallenged in this lawsuit (collectively, the “Challenged Orders”).   \nThe February 1 China Order.  On February 1, the President issued an executive order \nimposing 10 percent ad valorem tariffs on Chinese goods.  Exec. Order No. 14,195, Imposing \nDuties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. \nReg. 9121 (Feb. 1, 2025) (“February 1 China Order”).  The order was predicated on the influx of \nsynthetic opioids into the United States through China, which exports fentanyl and “related \nprecursor chemicals” to the U.S.  Id.  The order “expand[s] the scope of the national emergency” \nat the U.S.-Mexico border1 to “cover the failure of the [Chinese] government to arrest, seize, \ndetain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other \n[transnational criminal organizations], criminals at large, and drugs.”  Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n9122.  In issuing the order, President Trump invoked “section 1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA.”  Id. § 2, \n90 Fed. Reg. at 9122.  \n \n1 See Proclamation No. 10,886, Declaring a National Emergency at the Southern Border \nof the United States, 90 Fed. Reg. 8327 (Jan. 20, 2025); Exec. Order No. 14,157, Designating \nCartels and Other Organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated \nGlobal Terrorists, 90 Fed. Reg. 8439 (Jan. 20, 2025).  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 5 of 33\nThe March 3 China Amendment.  Around one month later, President Trump raised the \nChina tariffs to 20 percent based on his determination that China had “not taken adequate steps \nto alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement actions.”  Exec. Order \nNo. 14,228, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the \nPeople’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 11463 (Mar. 3, 2025) (“March 3 China Amendment”).  \nThen he ordered the elimination of duty-free de minimis treatment for goods subject to the tariffs, \ncontradicting a statutory program permitting duty exemptions for imported goods valued at less \nthan $800.  Exec. Order No. 14,256, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic \nOpioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports, 90 \nFed. Reg. 14899 (Apr. 2, 2025).  The Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) and Customs \nand Border Patrol (“CBP”) implemented the President’s China orders by modifying the HTSUS.  \nSee Implementation of Additional Duties on Products of the People’s Republic of China \nPursuant to the President’s February 1, 2025 Executive Order Imposing Duties To Address the \nSynthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 9038-01 (Feb. 5, \n2025) (implementing 10 percent tariff from February 1 China order); Further Amended Notice of \nImplementation of Additional Duties on Products of the People’s Republic of China Pursuant to \nthe President’s Executive Order 14195, Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply \nChain in the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 11426-01 (Mar. 6, 2025) (implementing \n20 percent tariff from March 3 China Amendment).  \nUniversal and Reciprocal Tariff Order.  On April 2, President Trump announced \nsweeping tariffs on virtually every U.S. trading partner.2  Exec. Order No. 14,257, Regulating \n \n2 Exempt from the tariffs were Canada, Mexico, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus.  \nSee Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 10, ECF No. 9.  Separate executive orders had imposed a 25 percent \ntariff on goods from Mexico and Canada.  See Exec. Order No. 14,194, Imposing Duties to \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 6 of 33\nImports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to Large and \nPersistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 (Apr. 2, 2025) (the \n“Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order”).  These “Liberation Day” tariffs encompassed a 10 \npercent universal tariff plus additional country-specific tariffs ranging from 11 to 50 percent.  Id. \nat 15045, 15049–50.  The Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order also announced a new national \nemergency “arising from conditions reflected in large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade \ndeficits” that “have contributed to the atrophy of domestic production capacity, especially that of \nthe U.S. manufacturing and defense-industrial base.”  Id. at 15044; see also Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 6 \n(“On April 2, 2025, the President declared a national emergency based on the trade deficit’s \neffect on the country’s economy and security.”).  To the President, these trade asymmetries \nconstitute an “unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the \nUnited States,” especially because of “the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad.”  90 Fed. Reg. at \n15041, 15044–45; see also Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares National \nEmergency to Increase Our Competitive Edge, Protect Our Sovereignty, and Strengthen Our \nNational and Economic Security, The White House (Apr. 2, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-\nnational-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-\nour-national-and-economic-security/ [https://perma.cc/UK3L-JDEV].  The 10 percent tariff went \ninto effect on April 5; the reciprocal tariffs were originally set to take effect on April 9.  Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. at 11, ECF No. 9. \n \nAddress the Situation at Our Southern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9117 (Feb. 1, 2025); Exec. Order \nNo. 14,193, Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit Drugs Across our Northern Border, \n90 Fed. Reg. 9113 (Feb. 1, 2025).  The President later paused, reinstated, and amended the scope \nof those orders in ways not relevant here.  \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 7 of 33\nApril 8 Reciprocal China Amendment & April 9 Reciprocal Modification.  But on \nApril 8, President Trump responded to retaliatory tariffs from China by raising the reciprocal \ntariff rate for China from 34 percent to 84 percent.  Exec. Order No. 14,259, Amendment to \nReciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People’s \nRepublic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,509 (Apr. 14, 2025) (“April 8 Reciprocal China \nAmendment”).  Then, on April 9, President Trump suspended for 90 days the reciprocal tariffs \nlisted in the Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order for all countries but China.  Exec. Order \nNo. 14,266, Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and \nAlignment, §§ 2, 3, 90 Fed. Reg. 15625 (Apr. 15, 2025) (“April 9 Reciprocal Modification”).  \nThe April 9 Reciprocal Modification also increased the China reciprocal tariff rate to 125 \npercent.  Id.  At the highest level, the total tariffs on most Chinese goods reached a minimum of \n145 percent.  Ana Swanson & Alan Rappeport, Tariff Truce With China Demonstrates the Limits \nof Trump’s Aggression, N.Y. Times (May 12, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/12/business/economy/trump-trade-china-tariffs.html \n[https://perma.cc/BKS4-NTGJ].  After trade talks in Geneva, the U.S. lowered the minimum \ntariffs on Chinese goods to 30 percent.  Id.  The ten percent universal tariffs from the Universal \nand Reciprocal Order are still in effect.  90 Fed. Reg. at 15626.   \nPresident Trump has stated that the tariffs originating in the Challenged Orders will raise \n“billions of dollars, even trillions of dollars” in revenue.  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 13 (quoting Bailey \nSchulz, Trump is Rolling Out More Tariffs This Month.

Joint Br. of Amici \nCuriae Former Senator and Governor George F. Allen, et al. (“Law Professors’ Amicus Br.”) \nat 7 (citing Christopher A. Casey et al., Cong. Rsch.

Inj. at 1 (“For five decades and across eight presidential Administrations, no President \nhad ever invoked IEEPA to impose a tariff or duty.”).  After President Trump issued the \nChallenged Orders, small businesses and other entities brought lawsuits in federal courts alleging \nthat the tariffs are unlawful.  See, e.g., Emily Ley Paper, Inc. v. Trump, No. 3:25-cv-465 (N.D. \nFla.) (transferred to the United States Court of International Trade); Webber v. U.S. Dep’t of \nHomeland Security, No. 4:25-cv-26 (D. Mont.) (appeal pending); California v. Trump, No. 3:25-\ncv-3372 (N.D. Cal.); V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-00066 (Ct.

The “scale of the IEEPA tariff burden is unsustainable” for their businesses, which may \nbe forced to raise prices by 70 percent or more “as a matter of pure survival.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 9.  \nBecause Plaintiffs have “no realistic way” to cover the costs associated with the increased tariffs, \n“the tariffs act as an immediate ban on the products [they] import.”  Id. ¶ 15.

Motion to Transfer for Lack of Jurisdiction \nFederal courts, as courts of limited jurisdiction, have an obligation to ensure that the \nactions they consider are “limited to those subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of \njurisdiction.”  Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. Compagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n701 (1982).  A plaintiff bears the burden of establishing a court’s subject-matter jurisdiction.  \nSweigert v. Perez, 334 F. Supp. 3d. 36, 40 (D.D.C. 2018).  If a court where an action is filed \nfinds “there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such \naction . . . to any other such court . . . in which the action or appeal could have been brought at \nthe time it was filed.”  28 U.S.C. § 1631; see also Jan’s Helicopter Serv. Inc. v. Fed. Aviation \nAdmin., 525 F.3d 1299, 1304 (Fed. Cir. 2008). \nB.  Preliminary Injunction \n“A preliminary injunction is ‘an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the [movant] is entitled to such relief.’”  John Doe Co. v. Consumer Fin. Prot.  \nBureau, 849 F.3d 1129, 1131 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (quoting Winter v. Natural Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008)).  “A plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must establish [1] that \nhe is likely to succeed on the merits, [2] that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief, [3] that the balance of equities tips in his favor, and [4] that an injunction is \nin the public interest.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  “The last two factors ‘merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.’”  Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & \nExplosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)).  \n“Of course, the movant carries the burden of persua[ding]” the Court that these factors merit \npreliminary relief, Fla. EB5 Invs., LLC v. Wolf, 443 F. Supp. 3d 7, 11 (D.D.C. 2020) (citing \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 13 of 33\nCobell v. Norton, 391 F.3d 251, 258 (D.C. Cir. 2004)), and must do so by making a “clear \nshowing,” Cobell, 391 F.3d at 258.  A district court must generally consider each of these factors \nin deciding whether to issue a preliminary injunction.  See Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, \n392–93 (D.C. Cir. 2011).   \nIV.  ANALYSIS \nA.  Subject-Matter Jurisdiction & Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nAt the outset, Plaintiffs must establish that the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over \ntheir claims.  See Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555 (1992).  The CIT has exclusive \njurisdiction over “any civil action commenced against the United States, its agencies, or its \nofficers, that arises out of any law of the United States providing for,” in relevant part, “tariffs, \nduties, fees, or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of \nrevenue.”  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B).  \nThis is undisputably a civil action against agencies and officers of the United States that \n“arises out of” IEEPA.  See Kosak v. United States, 465 U.S. 848, 854 (1984) (interpreting \n“arising out of” to “include[] a claim resulting from”); Int’l Lab. Rights Fund v. Bush, 357 F. \nSupp. 2d 204, 208 (D.D.C. 2004) (analyzing the CIT’s jurisdiction based on “the substantive law \ngiving rise to [the plaintiffs’] claims”).  So subject-matter jurisdiction turns on whether IEEPA is \na “law . . . providing for” “tariffs, duties, fees or other taxes on the importation of merchandise \nfor reasons other than the raising of revenue.”  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1).  If the answer is yes, then \nthe Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1).  If the \nanswer is no, then this Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and 1346.  See also K \nMart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U.S. 176, 182–83 (1988).  The jurisdictional question is \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 14 of 33\ntantamount to the principal merits question: whether IEEPA authorizes (or “provid[es] for”) \ntariffs.  See Pls.’ Transfer Opp’n at 1. \nDefendants argue that this Court must transfer the case to the CIT because “all of \n[P]laintiffs’ arguments concern the imposition of tariffs.”  E.g., Mot. Transfer at 1; see also \nDefs.’ PI Opp’n at 10–20.  They essentially take the position that all “tariff cases,” “tariff \nchallenges,” and “tariff matters” must go to the CIT for that court to determine in the first \ninstance whether it has jurisdiction.  See Mot. Transfer at 9–10 (emphases added).  That is not \nhow the CIT’s jurisdictional statute operates.  The statute is categorical: the jurisdictional hook is \nthe nature of the statute that a case arises out of, not the character of a plaintiff’s claims.  See K \nMart Corp., 485 U.S. at 188 (“Congress did not commit to the Court of International Trade’s \nexclusive jurisdiction every suit against the Government challenging customs-related laws and \nregulations.”) (emphasis in original); 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B); Miami Free Zone Corp. v. \nForeign Trade Zones Bd., 22 F.3d 1110, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (holding that “section 1581(i) \ngrants the CIT exclusive jurisdiction over actions arising from laws providing for—not ‘designed \nto deal with’ or ‘relating to’—revenue from imports”) (emphasis in original).  So the CIT has \njurisdiction over this case if, and only if, IEEPA is a “law of the United States providing for . . . \ntariffs.” 4  See 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B); Pls.’ Transfer Opp’n at 2.   \n \n4 Defendants argue in passing that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over this action \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(D), which applies to cases arising out of any law of the United \nStates providing for the “administration and enforcement” of tariffs.  See Mot. Transfer at 9, 11; \nDefs.’ Transfer Reply at 5.  They base this argument on the fact that the Challenged Orders \nmodified the HTSUS, which is essentially a list of the applicable tariff rates for all goods \nimported into the United States.  See Defs.’ Transfer Reply at 5; 19 U.S.C. § 2483.  This case \n“arises out of” the substantive law under which the President acted—IEEPA—not the HTSUS.  \nSee Int’l Lab. Rights Fund, 357 F. Supp. 2d at 208.  So 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(D) does not \nindependently apply.  Cf. K Mart Corp., 485 U.S. at 190–91 (holding that the CIT’s residual \njurisdictional provision does not apply if the underlying substantive law is not one “providing for \n. . . administration and enforcement” of something that itself falls under the CIT’s jurisdiction).  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 15 of 33\nDefendants claim that this Court cannot consider whether IEEPA provides for tariffs \nbecause that necessarily involves deciding the underlying merits (or, at this stage of the \nlitigation, whether Plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits).  But “courts \nalways have jurisdiction to determine their jurisdiction,” Ilan-Gat Eng’rs, Ltd. v. Antigua Int’l \nBank, 659 F.2d 234, 239 (D.C. Cir. 1981), including in instances where the CIT may ultimately \nhave exclusive jurisdiction.  K Mart Corp., 485 U.S. at 191 (resolving circuit split by rejecting \nFederal Circuit’s position that the CIT had exclusive jurisdiction over certain actions under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1581(i)).  And when the merits and jurisdiction are intertwined, like here, a court “can \ndecide all of the merits issues in resolving a jurisdictional question, or vice versa.”  Brownback v. \nKing, 592 U.S. 209, 217 (2021) (cleaned up).  The Court will therefore consider both whether it \nhas jurisdiction and whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits by deciding whether \nIEEPA is a law providing for tariffs. \nSince the Founding, the Constitution has vested the “Power to lay and collect Taxes, \nDuties, Imposts and Excises” with Congress.  U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 1.  The President has no \nindependent discretion to impose or alter tariffs.  See Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n343 U.S. 579, 585 (1952).  Any Presidential tariffing authority must be delegated by Congress.  \nSee United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d 560, 572 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (“[N]o undelegated \npower to regulate commerce, or to set tariffs, inheres in the Presidency.”); Law Professors’ \nAmicus Br. at 3 (stating that Congress’s power to control taxation is a “structural safeguard of \ndemocratic accountability”).  See generally 19 U.S.C.  \nBecause courts “must enforce plain and unambiguous statutory language according to its \nterms,” the Court looks to IEEPA’s text to determine whether it is a law providing for tariffs.  \nSee Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. 242, 251 (2010); 28 U.S.C. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 16 of 33\n§ 1581(i)(1)(B).  IEEPA does not use the words “tariffs” or “duties,” their synonyms, or any \nother similar terms like “customs,” “taxes,” or “imposts.”  It provides, as relevant here, that the \nPresident may, in times of declared national emergency, “investigate, block during the pendency \nof an investigation, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit” the \n“importation or exportation” of “property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has \nany interest.”  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  There is no residual clause granting the President \npowers beyond those expressly listed.  The only activity in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) that could \nplausibly encompass the power to levy tariffs is that to “regulate . . . importation.”  See Defs.’ PI \nOpp’n at 11 (relying on those words to argue that IEEPA authorizes the imposition of tariffs).    \nThe Court agrees with Plaintiffs that the power to regulate is not the power to tax.  See \nMot. Prelim. Inj. at 18.  The Constitution recognizes and perpetuates this distinction.  Clause 1 of \nArticle I, Section 8 provides Congress with the “Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts \nand Excises.”  Clause 3 of Article I, Section 8 empowers Congress “To regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations.”  If imposing tariffs and duties were part of the power “[t]o regulate \n[c]ommerce with foreign [n]ations,” then Clause 1 would have no independent effect.  As Chief \nJustice Marshall put it in an early leading case, “the power to regulate commerce is . . . entirely \ndistinct from the right to levy taxes and imposts.”  Gibbons v. Ogden, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 1, 201 \n(1824) (Marshall, C.J.).  The Constitution treats the power to regulate and the power to impose \ntariffs separately because they are not substitutes.  See id. at 198–99 (describing the power to tax \nand the power to regulate as “not . . . similar in their terms or their nature”).   \n“Tariff” and “regulate” also take different plain meanings.  To regulate something is to \n“[c]ontrol by rule” or “subject to restrictions.”  Regulate, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of \nCurrent English 943 (6th ed. 1976); see also Regulate, New Webster’s Dictionary of the English \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 17 of 33\nLanguage 1264 (1975) (“to govern by or subject to certain rules or restrictions”); see also Defs.’ \nPI Opp’n at 11 (citing similar definitions).  Tariffs are, by contrast, schedules of “duties or \ncustoms imposed by a government on imports or exports.”  Tariff, Random House Dictionary of \nthe English Language 1454 (1973).  To regulate is to establish rules governing conduct; to tariff \nis to raise revenue through taxes on imports or exports.  Pls.’ PI Reply at 3.  Those are not the \nsame.5  Cf. Tom Campbell, Presidential Authority to Impose Tariffs, 83 La. L. Rev. 595 (2023) \n(arguing that “tariffs are economically different from quantitative import restraints”).  If \nCongress had intended to delegate to the President the power of taxing ordinary commerce from \nany country at any rate for virtually any reason, it would have had to say so.  See Biden v. \nNebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505–06 (2023) (requiring a clear statement from Congress when the \ninterpretation of a provision would have a “question of ‘deep economic and political \nsignificance’ that is central to [the] statutory scheme”) (alteration in original) (quoting King v. \nBurwell, 576 U.S. 473, 486 (2015)).   \nThe other verbs in Section 1702(a)(1)(B) confirm that the President’s power to \n“regulate . . . [the] importation or exportation” of property does not encompass the power to \ntariff.  Per the principle of noscitur a sociis, “a word is given more precise content by the \nneighboring words with which it is associated.”  E.g., United States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, \n294 (2008).  Even if regulate may take a broad meaning in other contexts, see Defs.’ PI Opp’n at \n12, the words immediately surrounding it “cabin the contextual meaning of that term” here, see \n \n5 Defendants point out that in McGoldrick v. Gulf Oil Corporation, 309 U.S. 414, 428 \n(1940), the Supreme Court described “[t]he laying of a duty on imports” as both “an exercise of \nthe taxing power” and “an exercise of the power to regulate foreign commerce.”  Defs.’ PI Opp’n \nat 15.  Both of those powers belong to Congress, not the President.  See U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, \ncls. 1, 3. McGoldrick does not stand for the proposition that the President’s delegated power to \n“regulate . . . importation” includes the ability to unilaterally impose tariffs at any rate on any \ngoods from any country.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 18 of 33\nYates v. United States, 574 U.S. 528, 543 (2015).  The President’s IEEPA power to “regulate” is \npart of a list of verbs otherwise including “investigate, block during the pendency of an \ninvestigation, . . . direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit.”  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1702(a)(1)(B).  Not one of those words deals with the power to raise revenue.  In the context of \nthe words with which it is listed, “regulate” is appropriately read to refer to the President’s power \nto issue economic sanctions, not to tariff.  See Law Professors’ Amicus Br. at 8, 13; Mot. Prelim. \nInj. at 27.    \nNor does IEEPA include language setting limits on any potential tariff-setting power.  \nEvery time Congress delegated the President the authority to levy duties or tariffs in Title 19 of \nthe U.S. Code, it established express procedural, substantive, and temporal limits on that \nauthority.  E.g., 19 U.S.C. § 2132.  For one example, Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 \nauthorizes the President to impose an “import surcharge . . . in the form of duties . . . on articles \nimported into the United States” to “deal with large and serious United States balance-of-\npayments deficits,” but those tariffs are capped at 15 percent and can last only 150 days without \nCongressional approval.  Id. § 2132(a).  For another example, Section 338 of the Tariff Act of \n1930 grants the President the authority to “declare new or additional duties” of up to 50 percent \non imports from countries that have imposed “unreasonable” charges, exactions, regulations, or \nlimitations that are “not equally enforced upon the like articles of every foreign country,” or that \nhave “[d]iscriminate[d] in fact against the commerce of the United States.”  19 U.S.C. § 1338(a), \n(d), (e).  Those tariffs cannot take effect for thirty days.  Id. § 1338(d), (e).  For yet another \nexample, Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 authorizes an executive officer who serves under \nthe President to “impose duties or other import restrictions on the goods of” a foreign country \nthat has been found, after notice and investigation, to have committed unfair trade practices or \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 19 of 33\nviolated trade agreements with the United States.  19 U.S.C. § 2411(c).  Unlike IEEPA, each of \nthese statutes provides specific limitations on when the President may set or alter tariffs.  See \nalso, e.g., 19 U.S.C. § 1862 (authorizing the President to impose tariffs only against specific \nproducts, and only after the Secretary of Commerce has conducted a predicate investigation into \nnational security risks); cf. Fed. Energy Admin. v. Algonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 559–60, \n571 (1976) (interpreting the statutory phrase “adjust . . . imports” to give the President the power \nto impose license fees, but only after the Secretary of the Treasury independently determines that \nan “article is being imported into the United States in such quantities or under such \ncircumstances as to threaten to impair the national security,” and other “clear preconditions to \nPresidential action”).    \nThose comprehensive statutory limitations would be eviscerated if the President could \ninvoke a virtually unrestricted tariffing power under IEEPA.6  See Law Professors’ Amicus Br. \nat 9 (“If IEEPA meant what the government says it means, it would enable the President to \nimpose, revoke, or change tariffs for essentially any reason he describes as an emergency, \nwithout complying with any of the limitations that Congress attached to every statute delegating \ntariff authority.”), cf. Morton v. Mancari, 417 U.S. 535, 550–51 (1974) (discussing the principle \nthat in statutory interpretation, the specific prevails over the general); Guidry v. Sheet Metal \nWorkers Nat’l Pension Fund, 493 U.S. 365, 375 (1990) (same).  The Court will not assume that, \n \n6 Of course the necessary predicate for the exercise of any authority under IEEPA is the \nPresident’s declaration of a national emergency.  50 U.S.C. § 1701.  But the President’s power to \ndeclare a national emergency under the National Emergencies Act is broad, and Defendants take \nthe position that courts cannot review presidential declarations of emergencies because they \nconstitute nonjusticiable political questions.  Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 1, 31–36; see also Ctr. for \nBiological Diversity v. Trump, 453 F. Supp. 3d 11, 31 (D.D.C. 2020) (noting that “no court has \never reviewed the merits of such a declaration”) (emphasis in original); Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 581 \nn.32 (“[C]ourts will not review the bona fides of a declaration of an emergency by the \nPresident.”). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 20 of 33\nin enacting IEEPA, Congress repealed by implication every extant limitation on the President’s \ntariffing authority.  See Posadas v. Nat’l City Bank, 296 U.S. 497, 503 (1936) (“The cardinal rule \nis that repeals by implication are not favored.”).  “Congress has enacted a comprehensive \nscheme” detailing the conditions where the President may impose tariffs.  See RadLAX Gateway \nHotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.S. 639, 645 (2012) (quoting Varity Corp. v. Howe, 516 \nU.S. 489, 519 (1996) (Thomas, J., dissenting)).  “It would be anomalous,” to say the least, “for \nCongress to have so painstakingly described the [President’s] limited authority” on tariffs in \nother statutes, “but to have given him, just by implication,” nearly unlimited tariffing authority in \nIEEPA.  See Gonzales v. Oregon, 546 U.S. 243, 262 (2006). \nHistorical practice further indicates that IEEPA does not encompass the power to levy \ntariffs.  In the five decades since IEEPA was enacted, no President until now has ever invoked \nthe statute—or its predecessor, TWEA—to impose tariffs.  See Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21, 27; \nChristopher A. Casey et al., Cong. Rsch. Serv., R45618, The International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act: Origins, Evolution and Use, R45618 at 25–26, 58–62 (2024).  IEEPA has been \nconsistently understood by the Executive to authorize targeted economic sanctions on the \nperson7 or state responsible for the underlying threat to U.S. national security.  See Loper Bright \nEnters. v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 386 (2024) (“[T]he longstanding practice of the government \n. . . can inform a court’s determination of what the law is.”) (cleaned up) (quoting NLRB v. Noel \nCanning, 573 U.S. 513, 525 (2014)); Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21–27.  “This lack of historical \nprecedent, coupled with the breadth of authority that the [President] now claims, is a telling \n \n7 The Court means “person” in the broad legal sense.  See 1 U.S.C. § 1 (defining “person” \nto include “corporations, companies, associations, firms, partnerships, societies, and joint stock \ncompanies, as well as individuals”); see also 50 U.S.C. §§ 1708(d)(6), 1709(g)(8) (defining \n“person” as “an individual or entity”). \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 21 of 33\nindication that the [tariffs] extend[] beyond the [President’s] legitimate reach.”  See Nat’l Fed’n \nof Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin, 595 U.S. 109, 119 (2022) \n(per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor have IEEPA cases traditionally been filed \nin the CIT.  Hundreds of district court cases cite IEEPA Sections 1701 and 1702, but excluding \nthe cases recently filed challenging President Trump’s IEEPA tariffs, not one CIT case cites \neither provision.  See Pls.’ Transfer Opp’n at 10.  This makes sense because the mine run IEEPA \ncase has nothing to do with the CIT’s “unique and specialized expertise in trade law.”  See, e.g., \nHoly Land Found. for Relief & Dev. v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d 156 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (IEEPA case \nseeking to vacate Office of Foreign Asset Controls designations); OKKO Bus. PE v. Lew, 133 F. \nSupp. 3d 17 (D.D.C. 2015) (IEEPA case seeking to unblock a wire transfer); TikTok Inc. v. \nTrump, 507 F. Supp. 3d 92 (D.D.C. 2020) (IEEPA case seeking to enjoin ban on social media \napplication).    \nGeneral administrative practice also illustrates—and demands—a distinction between the \npower to regulate and the power to tax.  When a statute authorizes an agency to promulgate \nregulations on a topic, the agency can implement rules or restrictions relating to that topic.  See, \ne.g., 42 U.S.C. § 7412 (authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency to “promulgate \nregulations establishing emissions standards”).  The agency cannot, however, use its standard \nregulatory powers to raise revenue by imposing fees, tariffs, or taxes.  See Pls.’ PI Reply at 4–5; \ncf. Diginet, Inc. v. Western Union ATS, Inc., 958 F.2d 1388, 1399 (7th Cir. 1992) (“The legal \npower to regulate is not necessarily the legal power to tax.”).  Congress speaks clearly when it \ndelegates to an agency the authority to impose fees on regulated entities.  See 49 U.S.C. § \n40117(j) (listing the powers to tax and to regulate separately); 16 U.S.C. § 460bbb-9(a) (same); 2 \nU.S.C. § 622(8)(B)(i) (same).  The statutory term “regulate,” on its own, is not so capacious.  \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 22 of 33\nThat is true whether the power to regulate is delegated to an administrative agency or to the \nPresident.  \nDefendants’ counterarguments cannot and do no overcome IEEPA’s plain meaning.  For \none thing, their proposed interpretation of Section 1702(a)(1)(B) conflicts with the provision’s \ntextual limits.  The President’s IEEPA powers extend only to “any property in which any foreign \ncountry or a national thereof has any interest.”  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B); see Real v. Simon, \n510 F.2d 557, 562 (5th Cir. 1975).  Tariffs are typically assessed after U.S.-based importers have \ntaken legal possession of imported goods.  See 19 U.S.C. § 1484(a)(2)(B) (generally authorizing \nthe “owner or purchaser” of goods to be the importer of record); U.S. Customs & Border \nProtection, Entry Summary and Post Release Processes (last modified Apr. 10, 2025), \nhttps://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary [https://perma.cc/4U4F-\n7U6H] (“Within 10 days of the release of the cargo, the importer must pay the estimated duties \non their imported goods.”).  Property wholly owned by U.S. nationals falls outside of IEEPA’s \nscope.  See 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B); see also Law Professors’ Amicus Br. at 8–9 (describing \nhow all the “permitted presidential actions” in IEEPA “have their effects abroad,” while tariffs \nare “taxes paid by Americans”).   \nAnd as Plaintiffs pointed out at oral argument, Defendants’ interpretation could render \nIEEPA unconstitutional.  IEEPA provides that the President may “regulate . . . importation or \nexportation.”  50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  The Constitution prohibits export taxes.  See U.S. \nConst. art. I, § 9, cl. 5 (“No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.”).  If \nthe term “regulate” were construed to encompass the power to impose tariffs, it would \nnecessarily empower the President to tariff exports, too.  The Court cannot interpret a statute as \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 23 of 33\nunconstitutional when any other reasonable construction is available.  See Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 563 (2012). \nDefendants’ interpretation would also create a jurisdictional split between IEEPA actions \ninitiated by the government, which are not “commenced against the United States, its agencies, \nor its officers,” and would fall under the jurisdiction of the district courts; and IEEPA actions \ninitiated against the government, which would go to the CIT.  See 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1); 50 \nU.S.C. § 1705(a)–(c) (establishing civil and criminal penalties for violations of IEEPA); see, e.g., \nUnited States v. Three Sums Totaling $612,168.23 in Seized U.S. Currency, 55 F.4th 932, 935–\n36 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (IEEPA claim filed by the government in federal district court).  That would \ntotally warp the principles of consistency and expertise that Defendants invoke to support their \nclaim that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over this action.  See Mot. Transfer at 9–10.   \nDefendants lean heavily on United States v. Yoshida International, Inc. (“Yoshida”), 526 \nF.2d 560, a 1975 decision from the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the Federal Circuit’s \npredecessor, but that case is not binding on this Court.  See Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 2, 4, 12, 14, 16–\n19, 23, 26–28, 32, 35; see also Coal. to Preserve the Integrity of Am. Trademarks v. United \nStates, 790 F.2d 903, 905–07 (D.C. Cir. 1986), aff’d in part sub nom. K Mart. Corp., 485 U.S. at \n190–91 (rejecting Federal Circuit’s jurisdictional analysis).  Nor does the Court find it \npersuasive.8   \n \n8 Two other district courts have, in cases materially similar to this one, granted the \ngovernment’s motion to transfer to the CIT largely in reliance upon Yoshida.  See Webber v. U.S. \nDep’t of Homeland Sec., 2025 WL 1207587 (D. Mont. Apr. 25, 2025); Emily Ley Paper v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 1482771 (N.D. Fla. May 20, 2025).  This Court respectfully disagrees with \ntheir analyses.  And the Court finds it even less persuasive that the CIT, which is bound by \nYoshida, is exercising jurisdiction over lawsuits raising similar claims.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 24 of 33\nThe facts of Yoshida are as follows.  During the summer of 1971, the United States faced \n“an economic crisis” arising out of a balance of payments deficit.  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 567.  \nPresident Nixon responded by issuing a proclamation that, among other things, imposed a 10 \npercent surcharge on imported goods.  Id.; see also Proclamation No. 4074, 36 Fed. Reg. 15724 \n(Aug. 17, 1971).  The tariffs were known as the “Nixon shock,” see Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 17, and \nwere withdrawn in less than five months, Law Professors’ Amicus Br. at 11.  A zipper importer, \nYoshida International, challenged the tariffs’ legality in a refund suit.  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 566.  \nAt the time Section 5(b) of the TWEA allowed the President to, in emergencies, “regulate . . . \n[the] importation . . . of . . . any property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has \nany interest.”9  Id. at 570.  Although President Nixon had not invoked TWEA,10 the Customs \nCourt11 analyzed whether that statute authorized the tariffs and concluded that it did not.  \nYoshida Int’l, Inc. v. United States (“Yoshida I”), 378 F. Supp. 1155, 1171 (Cust. Ct. 1974), \nrev’d, Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 576 (C.C.P.A. 1975) (“It cannot be said that the investiture of a \npower to ‘regulate’ necessarily includes, per se, the power to levy duties.”); see also id. at 1172 \n(“If the words ‘regulate . . . importation’ were given the construction contended by the \ndefendant, the President by the declaration of a national emergency could determine and fix rates \nof duty at will, without regard to statutory rates prescribed by the Congress and without the \n \n9 The same language appears in IEEPA.  \n10 In issuing Proclamation 4074, President Nixon instead invoked the Tariff Act of 1930 \nand the Trade Expansion Act of 1962.  36 Fed.

No. 95-459, at 5 (1977) (“[TWEA] was not among the statutes cited in the President’s \nproclamation as authority for the surcharge.”); see also Pls.’ PI Reply at 9–10.  TWEA was first \ncited “later by the Government in response to a suit brought in Customs Court by Yoshida \nInternational”—i.e., in Yoshida.  H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 5.  \n11 The Customs Court is the CIT’s predecessor.  See Customs Courts Act of 1980, Pub. L. \nNo. 96-417, § 702, 94 Stat. 1727, 1748 (1980). \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 25 of 33\nbenefit of standards or guidelines which must accompany any valid delegation of a constitutional \npower by the Congress.” (alteration in original)).  \nThe Court of Customs and Patent Appeals reversed based on “the intent of Congress” and \n“the broad purposes of the [TWEA].”  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 583; see also id. at 573 (emphasizing \nthat “the primary implication of an emergency power is that it should be effective to deal with a \nnational emergency successfully”).  That is no longer how courts approach statutory \ninterpretation.  See Am. Fed. of Gov. Empls., Nat’l Council of HUD Locals Council 222, AFL-\nCIO v. FLRA, 99 F.4th 585, 590 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (discussing how purposivism was, by the end \nof the twentieth century, “largely rejected in favor of a stricter focus on a statute’s text” (citing \nJohn F. Manning, Textualism and the Equity of the Statute, 101 Colum. L. Rev. 1, 6–7 (2001))); \nLoper Bright, 603 U.S. at 443 n.6 (Gorsuch, J., concurring) (describing how in 1984 “there were \nmany judges who abhorred plain meaning and preferred instead to elevate legislative history and \ntheir own curated accounts of a law’s purposes over enacted statutory text,” but now courts have \n“a more faithful adherence to the written law” (cleaned up)).  The Supreme Court could not be \nmore clear that courts must focus on a statute’s text.  E.g., Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U.S. 113, \n118 (2009) (“As with any question of statutory interpretation, our analysis begins with the plain \nlanguage of the statute.”); see also Lamie v. U.S. Trustee, 540 U.S. 526, 534 (2004) (“It is well \nestablished that ‘when the statute’s language is plain, the sole function of the courts—at least \nwhere the disposition required by the text is not absurd—is to enforce it according to its terms.’” \n(quoting Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.A., 530 U.S. 1, 6 (2000)).  So \nYoshida’s reasoning is not compelling on its own terms.   \nAnd in deciding that case, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals acknowledged that \n“nothing in the TWEA or in its history . . . specifically either authorizes or prohibits the \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 26 of 33\nimposition of a surcharge,” and that “Congress did not specify that the President could use a \nsurcharge in a national emergency.”  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 572–73, 576.  Yoshida also expressly \nrejected the premise that the TWEA enabled the President to “impos[e] whatever tariff rates he \ndeems desirable,” id. at 578, which is the power President Trump has claimed in issuing the \nChallenged Orders.  Yoshida is further distinguishable because the tariffs at issue there applied \nonly to goods already subject to tariff reductions, and at rates that did not exceed the original \nstatutory maximum set out by Congress.  See Law Professors’ Amicus Br. at 12 n.2.   \nAs Plaintiffs point out, other events confirm that Congress did not intend for the language \n“regulate . . . importation” to delegate the authority to impose tariffs.  See Pls.’ PI Reply at 11–\n12.  Just before enacting IEEPA, Congress passed Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974.  Pub. L. \nNo. 93-618, 88 Stat. 1978 (1975).  That statute specifically authorized the tariffs President Nixon \nhad imposed in Proclamation 4074 by providing that the President may impose an “import \nsurcharge . . . in the form of duties . . . on articles imported into the United States” to “deal with \nlarge and serious United States balance-of-payments deficits.” 19 U.S.C. § 2132(a); see also id. \n§ 2411(c)(1)(B).  Section 122 would have been pointless if Congress understood TWEA (and \nlater, IEEPA) to allow that same tariffing authority.  And in reaching its holding, the Yoshida \ncourt expressly relied on the fact that there was then no specific statute “‘providing procedures’ \nfor dealing with a national emergency involving a balance of payments problem such as that \nwhich existed in 1971.”  Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 578; see also id. at 582 n.33 (expressly declining \nto determine what effect “the specific grant of the surcharge authority spelled out in the Trade \nAct of 1974” had on the President’s TWEA powers in 1971).  That is no longer true.   \nFinally, the President’s IEEPA powers were designed to be “more limited in scope than \nthose of [TWEA].”  H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 2 (1977).  The Court disagrees with Defendants \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 27 of 33\nthat, by adopting the TWEA’s language in IEEPA, Congress endorsed Yoshida’s holding.  See \nPls.’ PI Reply at 13 (arguing that courts only assume Congress adopts an earlier judicial \nconstruction of a phrase where there is “settled precedent” on the interpretation of a statute, and \nthat conflicting lower court decisions do not constitute settled precedent (quoting United States v. \nCollazo, 984 F.3d 1308, 1328 (9th Cir. 2021))).  Contra Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 4, 12, 14.   Yoshida is \nnot a reason for this Court to reject IEEPA’s plain meaning. \n* * * \nTwo conclusions follow from the Court’s analysis.  First, because IEEPA is not a “law \n. . . providing for tariffs,” this Court, not the CIT, has jurisdiction over this lawsuit. 12  The \nstatutory phrase “regulate . . . importation,” as used in IEEPA, does not encompass the power to \ntariff.  The plain meaning of “regulate” is not “to tax.”  And historical practice, as well as \nCongress’s actions in response to the “Nixon shock” tariffs, confirm that the statute is not so \ncapacious.  Second, because IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs, the tariffs \nthat derive from the Challenged Orders are ultra vires.  Plaintiffs have therefore shown that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the President, in issuing the Challenged \nOrders, acted ultra vires, and that the agency defendants, in implementing them, violated the \n \n12 Although Defendants do not raise this argument, Amicus America First takes the \nposition that the CIT has exclusive jurisdiction over all IEEPA actions because it is a law \n“providing for . . . embargoes . . . for reasons other than protections of the public health or \nsafety.”  See America First Amicus Br.; 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(C).  That would be a sea change \nin IEEPA practice, as district courts have exercised jurisdiction over hundreds of IEEPA cases \nbrought against the government.  See Pls.’ Transfer Opp’n at 10.  Such a jurisdictional shift \nwould also run counter to the CIT’s role as a “specialized court of limited jurisdiction.”  See \nHorizon Lines, LLC. v. United States, 414 F. Supp. 2d 46, 52 (D.D.C. 2006).  Further, Presidents \nhave used IEEPA to respond to threats to public health and safety.  For example, the February 1 \nChina Order challenged in this case expressly imposed IEEPA sanctions to address the illegal \nflow of fentanyl into the U.S.  90 Fed. Reg. at 9121.  If IEEPA provides for embargoes, those \nembargoes could be to protect the public health or safety.  That brings IEEPA outside the scope \nof Section 1581(i)(1)(C), so America First’s jurisdictional argument fails. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 28 of 33\nAdministrative Procedure Act.  The Court does not reach Plaintiffs’ alternative arguments that \nIEEPA does not authorize these specific tariffs or that, if it does authorize these tariffs, it violates \nthe nondelegation doctrine.  \nB.  Irreparable Harm \nPlaintiffs have established that they will likely suffer irreparable harm absent a \npreliminary injunction because the tariffs originating in the Challenged Orders pose an \nexistential threat to their businesses.  See, e.g., Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 28; Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 41; \nsee also League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 8–9 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (reiterating \nthat “a preliminary injunction requires only a likelihood of irreparable injury”).  They cannot \noffset the highest IEEPA tariffs without raising prices 70 percent or more “as a matter of pure \nsurvival,” Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 9; their customers have already canceled over $1 million in \norders, id. ¶ 10; and they face an immediate 40 or 50 percent decline in sales, year-over-year, id. \n¶ 11.  The companies “cannot possibly absorb the costs of the increased tariffs” without \n“changing [their] pricing radically.”  Id. ¶¶ 6, 14.  But they cannot pass price increases onto their \ncustomers without selling substantially fewer products.  Id. ¶¶ 16, 18.  Plaintiffs are not “massive \nentities that can withstand such losses in their core business[es].”  See Everglades Harvesting & \nHauling, Inc. v. Scalia, 427 F. Supp. 3d 101, 116 (D.D.C. 2019).  Nor can they reduce the quality \nof their products to support lower prices: reducing quality is “unthinkable” for “premium brands” \nlike Plaintiffs, and is practically unworkable because it would require them to “change the design \nand/or production of more than 2,000 products at once.”  Id. ¶ 15.   \nWithout an injunction, Plaintiffs may have to refinance loans on unfavorable terms; \nsignificantly scale back operations and product offerings; close facilities; lay off employees; or \npossibly sell their businesses.  Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 41.  Granted, financial losses typically do not \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 29 of 33\nconstitute irreparable harm.  E.g., Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  \nBut that is not the case when “the loss threatens the very existence of the movant’s business.”  Id.  \nThe government argues that Plaintiffs’ harms are speculative and conclusory.  See Defs.’ \nPI Opp’n at 37–39.  The Court disagrees.  See Pls.’ PI Reply at 20–21 (detailing, to the extent \npossible, the specific costs that Plaintiffs have incurred because of the Challenged Orders).  How \ncould Plaintiffs possibly describe the exact costs they will face from paying tariffs that the \nPresident imposes, pauses, adjusts, and reimposes at will?  See Woldenberg Decl. ¶¶ 7–8 \n(describing the “ever-changing situation with the IEEPA tariffs” and “considerable uncertainty \nabout future economic conditions and trade rules”).  The instability and unpredictability of the \nchanging tariff rates cause “massive disruptions in [their] supply chain, business relations, and \nbusiness operations.”  Id. ¶ 8; see Tex. Children’s Hosp. v. Burwell, 76 F. Supp. 3d 224, 242 \n(D.D.C. 2014).  Without preliminary relief, Plaintiffs will be subjected to ongoing “supply chain \nchaos, an incredibly burdensome and constantly shifting tariff landscape, and a very high price to \nbe paid for incorrect logistical judgments.”  Woldenberg Decl. ¶ 10.  And because their financial \nrecovery is limited to the value of any tariffs they wrongly pay, see 19 U.S.C. § 1505(a)–(b), \nPlaintiffs will not be able to recover lost profits, lost customers, or the “additional cost[s]” of \nfinding “replacement[s]” for high-tariff imports.  See Vaqueria Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Irizarry, \n587 F.3d 464, 485 (1st Cir. 2009) (“[T]he inability to supply a full line of products may \nirreparably harm a merchant by shifting purchasers to other suppliers.”); Nalco Co. v. EPA, 786 \nF. Supp. 2d 177, 188 (D.D.C. 2011) (holding that agency action that would make it “difficult for \n[the plaintiff] to attract new customers” is “at least some degree of irreparable injury”).   \nAs Plaintiffs stated at oral argument, to the extent the tariffs cause them not to import \ngoods in the first instance, they cannot recover the value of the resulting lost sales, business \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 30 of 33\nopportunities, market share, or customer goodwill.  See Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 38–39.  In this \ncontext, those harms qualify as irreparable.  See, e.g., Patriot, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Housing & \nUrban Dev., 963 F. Supp. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1997) (“damage to [a company’s] business reputation” \ncan be “irreparable harm”); Nalco Co., 786 F. Supp. 2d at 188 (finding irreparable harm where \npetitioner would “suffer the loss of ‘[l]ong-standing clients . . . [that may be] unwilling, or \nunable, to do business’” with them absent an injunction (alterations in original) (quoting \nFeinerman v. Bernardi, 558 F. Supp. 2d 36, 50–51 (D.D.C. 2008)).  Contra Defs.’ PI Opp’n at \n38 (stating, without support, that Plaintiffs’ “loss of business opportunities and goodwill” could \nbe “indirectly” redressed through refunds).  The Court is therefore satisfied that Plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated irreparable harm. \nC.  Balance of Equities & Public Interest  \nFinally, the Court considers whether the balance of equities and the public interest favor a \npreliminary injunction.  When the government is the party to be enjoined, these two factors \nmerge.  See Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  The Supreme Court has instructed that “[a]n injunction is a \nmatter of equitable discretion; it does not follow from success on the merits as a matter of \ncourse.”  Winter, 555 U.S. at 32.  “In exercising their sound discretion, courts of equity should \npay particular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of an \ninjunction.”  Weinberger v. Romero-Barcelo, 456 U.S. 305, 312 (1982) (citing R.R. Comm’n v. \nPullman Co., 312 U.S. 496, 500 (1941)).   \nWithout a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs will sustain significant and unrecoverable \nlosses.  They take the position that if the Court grants their motion, the government will face a \npause of the IEEPA tariffs only as directed to two small businesses whose imports are relatively \ninconsequential to the national economy.  See Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 43 (requesting that the Court \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 31 of 33\n“enjoin the agency Defendants and their agents, employees, and all persons acting under their \ndirection and control, from taking any action to collect tariffs from Plaintiffs under the \nChallenged Orders”) (emphasis added).  And “[t]he public interest is served when the legislation \nthat Congress has enacted,” like IEEPA, “is complied with.”  American Rivers v. U.S. Army \nCorps of Eng’rs, 271 F. Supp. 2d 230, 262 (D.D.C. 2003); see also League of Women Voters, \n838 F.3d at 12 (holding that is there generally no public interest in unlawful agency action).   \nOn the government’s side, four Cabinet officials submitted declarations outlining the \n“catastrophic harm to American foreign policy and national security that would ensue from \ngranting the relief requested in [P]laintiffs’ motion.”  Notice of Add’l Exs. at 1; see also Decl. of \nHoward Luntick ¶ 19 (“All told, an invalidation of President Trump’s ability to use IEEPA \nwould dismantle a cornerstone of President Trump’s national security architecture, irreparably \nharm the government’s ability to respond to evolving foreign threats, . . . jeopardize vital trade \nagreements, collapse ongoing negotiations, allow for Chinese aggression during a period of \nstrategic competition, leave the American people exposed to predatory economic practices by \nforeign actors, and threaten national security.”).  Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that an \norder enjoining the tariffs “would cause significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy \nand national security” because negotiations with trading partners are “in a delicate state.”  Decl. \nof Marco Rubio ¶¶ 3, 9.  “These negotiations could address the urgent threats of mass migration \nat our northern and southern borders, the flow of fentanyl into our country, and the erosion of our \ndomestic production capacity,” id. ¶ 8, and constitute “one of the country’s top foreign policy \npriorities.”  Id. ¶ 10.  According to Secretary Rubio, “much of U.S. global diplomacy has been \nfocused on these negotiations.”  Id. ¶ 10; see also Decl. of Scott Bessent ¶ 9.  Every ongoing \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 32 of 33\nnegotiation is “premised on the ability of the President to impose tariffs under IEEPA.”  Decl. of \nMarco Rubio ¶ 11.  \nThe Cabinet officials claim that were a court to enjoin the tariffs announced in the \nChallenged Orders, U.S. trading partners could retaliate against the tariffs.; the U.S. would be \nembarrassed on the global stage; and the U.S.’s manufacturing position may be so weakened that \nthe country may “not be able to produce the weapons and other resources necessary to defend \nitself.”  Id. ¶¶ 12–14.  These consequences go to “critical” foreign policy and national security \ninterests.  Id. ¶ 16; see also Decl. of Howard Lutnick ¶¶ 4–4 (describing that the national \nemergencies underlying the Challenged Orders “threaten[] the lives of [U.S.] citizens”).   The \nCourt agrees with Defendants that the public has a compelling interest in the “President’s \nconduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security.”  See Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 41; see \nalso Winter, 555 U.S. at 24.   \nBut on May 28, a three-judge panel of the CIT issued an order permanently enjoining the \nIEEPA tariffs.  See Opinion, V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-00066, at 48–49 (Ct. Int’l \nTrade May 28, 2025).  The consequences described by the government officials in their \ndeclarations will flow, if at all, from that court’s sweeping order.  Under the circumstances, \nenjoining the application of the Challenged Orders to two family-owned toy companies will have \nvirtually no effect on the government.  Contra Defs.’ PI Opp’n at 41–42 (arguing that \n“[P]laintiffs’ proposed injunction would be an enormous intrusion on the President’s conduct of \nforeign affairs and efforts to protect national security under IEEPA and the Constitution”).  It \nwill, however, protect those companies from irreparable injury should the CIT order be stayed or \nreversed.  The Court concludes that the balance of equities and the public interest therefore favor \nPlaintiffs.  Besides, “[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 37     Filed 05/29/25     Page 33 of 33\nwhat the law is.”  Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. 137, 177 (1803) (Marshall, C.J.).  The President \ncannot act unlawfully and then use the effects of having that action declared unlawful as a \nputative shield from judicial review.  \nV.  CONCLUSION \nBecause IEEPA is not a law providing for tariffs and because Plaintiffs have satisfied the \npreliminary injunction factors, Defendants’ motion to transfer venue is DENIED; and Plaintiffs’ \nmotion for a preliminary injunction is GRANTED.  The Court will stay operation of the \npreliminary injunction for 14 days.

This  action  challenges  an  extraordinary  Executive  Branch  power  grab.  The \nPresident has asserted the authority to impose tariffs (essentially, taxes) on imports from any \ncountry, on any schedule, in any amount, and for any policy reason couched as an “emergency.” \nNeither the Constitution nor the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (“IEEPA”) grants \nthe President tariff-levying authority at all, let alone of the limitless type asserted here. And \nbecause these actions are irreparably harming Plaintiffs Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 3 of 37\nInc.—American family-owned businesses that develop educational products for schools and \nfamilies—this Court should enjoin Defendants’ actions before even more damage is done.  \n2. The President unilaterally decided, through a series of unprecedented executive \norders invoking IEEPA, to remake America’s global trade policy. He began by increasing existing \ntariffs on America’s three largest trading partners: a 10 percent increase on all goods imported \nfrom China, and even larger increases on goods imported from Mexico and Canada. In March, the \nPresident raised the tariffs on goods imported from China from 10 to 20 percent. In April, the \nPresident imposed a 10 percent tariff on nearly all goods from all countries indefinitely. He also \nimposed, then within a week paused for ninety days, additional “reciprocal” tariffs of up to 50 \npercent for all but a handful of our trading partners. Those tariffs included a 34 percent tariff on \ngoods imported from China, and after China retaliated, President Trump increased the reciprocal \ntariff to 125 percent. The President did not suspend the reciprocal tariffs for China. Because the \nnew rate imposed is added on top of long-existing duties, some tariffs on Chinese goods are now \nas high as 245 percent. Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Ensures National Security and \nEconomic Resilience Through Section 232 Actions on Processed Critical Minerals and Derivative \nProducts, THE WHITE HOUSE (Apr. 15, 2025).1\n3. Altogether, the President has imposed—through executive fiat—tariffs on trillions \nof dollars of economic activity. The money raised by these tariffs, which the government has \nestimated at $600 billion per year, will not be paid by foreign governments but by American \nbusinesses and consumers. That crushing burden is felt most immediately and acutely by this \ncountry’s  small  and  mid-size  businesses,  including  Plaintiffs.  Indeed,  Plaintiffs  are  already \n1  https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-\nensures-national-security-and-economic-resilience-through-section-232-actions-on-processed-\ncritical-minerals-and-derivative-products/. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 4 of 37\nsuffering dire impacts and irreparable harm to their businesses and customers. \n4. Plaintiffs are family-owned businesses, now in their fourth generation, that have \ncreated and sold over 2,000 hands-on educational toys and products for children. Their award-\nwinning products are found in toy closets and classrooms across the country and range from Spike \nthe Fine Motor Hedgehog to Peekaboo Learning Farm, from Pretend & Play Teaching Cash \nRegister to Kanoodle (a caboodle of brain-teasing puzzles) and Mirror My Sound Phoneme Set. \nWith the mission to “bring learning to life,” they seek to help younger children develop verbal, \ncounting, and fine motor skills, and introduce older children to science, technology, engineering, \nand math. Plaintiffs have faced and survived significant challenges in the past two decades, \nincluding the Great Recession and COVID-19 pandemic, but the President’s unilateral tariffs are \nnow posing the greatest challenge of their existence.   \n5. No act of Congress comes close to vesting the President with the extraordinary \npower he asserts. The Constitution vests the power to impose tariffs exclusively in Congress. U.S. \nCONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 1. Any tariff action taken by the Executive Branch must therefore be \nauthorized by statute and consistent with Congress’s instructions. The executive orders at issue \nhere (the “Challenged Orders”)2 and agency action implementing them fail on both fronts.  \n6. IEEPA  was  enacted  in  1977  to  grant  the  President  specified  authority  over \neconomic transactions during a national emergency, such as the power to impose sanctions on \nforeign terrorists or hostile foreign nations responsible for unusual and extraordinary threats to \nAmerican security. See 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701 et seq. The statute does not mention tariffs or duties, \n2 This  Complaint refers to the orders imposing tariffs currently in operation  as  the \n“Challenged Orders.” For the Court’s convenience, the Challenged Orders are listed in Appendix \nA and grouped as the “China IEEPA Orders” and the “Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Orders.” \nThe Appendix also provides a brief description, short-form citation, and full citation for each order.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 5 of 37\nand in the five decades and eight administrations since its enactment, no President besides \nPresident Trump has ever invoked IEEPA to impose a tariff or a duty. Instead, Congress has \nformulated—and Presidents have relied on—a plethora of other laws codified in Title 19 of the \nUnited  States  Code  that  authorize  the  Executive  Branch  to  take  tariff  action  in  limited \ncircumstances and in compliance with various congressionally imposed procedures. There is no \ntextual or historical basis for imposing tariffs under IEEPA, let alone the kind of unmistakable \nstatutory grounding that is required in a case involving executive actions of “vast economic and \npolitical significance.” West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 716 (2022). The President’s novel \nclaim that he may use IEEPA to impose tariffs of any amount, on any goods, imported from any\ncountry, and without any process is patently wrong. \n7. Even if IEEPA could be stretched to authorize tariffs, the tariffs adopted in the \nChallenged Orders violate the terms of the statute. In IEEPA, Congress specified that the statute’s \nauthority “may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to \nwhich a national emergency has been declared . . . and may not be exercised for any other purpose.” \n50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). Here, however, the statute has been used to address longstanding issues that \nare the opposite of “unusual and extraordinary” (like decades-old trade deficits). It has been \ninvoked to adopt tariffs that have no connection to the declared emergencies (like those imposed \non goods from countries with whom the United States has a trade surplus). And it has been \nemployed to accomplish goals that are entirely unrelated to any declared national emergency (like \nraising revenue for the federal government). Far from a limited emergency powers statute, IEEPA \nhas become an all-purpose tool to achieve the President’s long-term policy objectives. \n8. The President’s novel assertion of power is foreclosed by IEEPA’s text. But it \nshould also be rejected because it would render IEEPA unconstitutional under the nondelegation \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 6 of 37\ndoctrine. Congress is not permitted to grant legislative authority to the Executive Branch without \nat least an intelligible principle to guide the Executive’s discretion. Under the Challenged Orders’ \ninterpretation of IEEPA, however, there is none. The President would have authority to make \nmajor policy judgments about tariffs without any instruction from Congress on the amount, the \ncountry of origin, or the duration of the tariff, and there would be no need to demonstrate that the \naction taken has any reasonable relationship to an “unusual and extraordinary” threat. This Court \nshould not adopt an interpretation that so blatantly violates our constitutional structure.  \n9. For  these  reasons  and  more,  the  Challenged  Orders  and  the  agency  actions \nmodifying  the  Harmonized  Tariff  Schedule  of  the  United  States  (“HTSUS”)  or  otherwise \nimplementing  those  orders  are  unlawful.  This  Court  should  declare  as  much  and  enjoin \nenforcement. \nPARTIES \n10. Plaintiffs Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc. are private, family-owned \nAmerican companies, based in Illinois, that develop, market, and sell educational products, \neducational toys, and pet toys. Plaintiffs market products under brands including LEARNING \nRESOURCES, EDUCATIONAL INSIGHTS, HAND2MIND, and BRIGHTKINS, and are a \nworld leader in the development of experiential, hands-on learning materials which are sold in \nmore than 100 countries. Plaintiffs have more than 500 employees and full-time equivalents today, \nand have offices in Vernon Hills, Illinois; Torrance, California; and Amherst, New York. Plaintiffs \ndevelop their products (and perform some manufacturing and assembly) in the United States, but \noutsource most manufacturing to factories in other countries, including (but not limited to) China, \nTaiwan, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and India. Plaintiffs import directly from China and those other \ncountries, and both companies thus pay duties and tariffs on such imports. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 7 of 37\n11.

Defendant Jamieson Greer, in his official capacity, is the United States Trade \nRepresentative.  He  is  responsible  for  implementing  tariffs  directed  by  the  Universal  and \nReciprocal IEEPA Order. \n21. Defendant the Office of the United States Trade Representative is responsible for \nimplementing tariffs directed by the Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA Order. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1346 because this civil action arises under the Constitution of the United States and federal \nstatutes, and does not arise from a law authorizing the imposition of tariffs within the meaning of \n28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B). The Court is authorized to award the requested relief under 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 702, 705, 706, and 28 U.S.C. §§ 1361, 2201, 2202, and through the equitable powers of this \nCourt. \n23. Venue is proper in this judicial district under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1) because an \nofficer of the United States in his or her official capacity, or an agency of the United States, is a \ndefendant, each defendant officer and agency resides in this District, and a substantial part of the \nevents giving rise to Plaintiffs’ claims occurred in this District.  \nSTANDING \n24. To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff must show injury in fact, causation, and \nredressability. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-561 (1992). Both Plaintiffs are \nharmed by the challenged tariff action because each directly imports goods from China and other \ncountries subject to the Challenged Orders, and each thus must pay additional tariffs to the federal \ngovernment because of the Challenged Orders and corresponding revisions to the HTSUS. See \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 425 (2021) (“If a defendant has caused physical or \nmonetary injury to the plaintiff, the plaintiff has suffered a concrete injury in fact under Article \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 9 of 37\nIII.”); Hein v. Freedom From Religion Found., Inc., 551 U.S. 587, 599 (2007) (“being forced to \npay” money to the government “causes a real and immediate economic injury”). Declaratory and \ninjunctive relief will redress these injuries because Plaintiffs will no longer be required to pay the \ntariff or make harmful changes to their business operations to account for increased costs.  \nBACKGROUND \n  A.  The President Has Limited Tariff Authority Only As Delegated By Congress. \n25. The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted . . . in a Congress of \nthe United States,” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1, including the power to “lay and collect . . . Duties,” id. \nart. I, § 8, cl. 1. Because the Constitution vests the tariff power in Congress, Congress is “the \nprincipal venue in which trade policy is determined.” DOUGLAS A. IRWIN, CLASHING OVER \nCOMMERCE: AHISTORY OF U.S.TRADE POLICY, 2 (2017) (“Clashing Over Commerce”). To the \nextent the President is involved in tariffs through a delegation of congressional authority, it is either \nto impose tariffs in defined circumstances under Title 19 of the United States Code or to negotiate \ntrade  agreements  subject  to  Congress’s  approval.  In  either  form,  the  President’s  power  is \nnecessarily circumscribed by the Constitution and limits enacted by Congress.  \n26. On multiple occasions, Congress has delegated limited authority to the President or \nmembers of the Executive Branch to impose tariffs—including, under Section 232 of the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962, for the explicit purpose of “[s]afeguarding national security.” 19 U.S.C. \n§ 1862. But where Congress has delegated this authority, it has done so expressly and has limited \nthe President’s or Executive Branch’s authority to specific situations so that Congress retains its \nessential legislative function. See Chrysler Corp. v. Brown, 441 U.S. 281, 302 (1979) (Executive \nBranch may exercise delegated authority “subject to limitations which [Congress] imposes”); see, \ne.g., 19 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (authorizing President to “declare new or additional duties” of up to 50 \npercent  on  imports  from  countries  that  have  imposed  “unreasonable”  charges,  exactions, \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 10 of 37\nregulations, or limitations that are “not equally enforced upon the like articles of every foreign \ncountry” or “[d]iscriminat[ed] in fact against the commerce of the United States”); id. § 1862 \n(authorizing President to impose tariffs in response to a specific finding that certain imports impair \nnational security, subject to numerous procedural requirements and limitations); id. § 2132(a) \n(authorizing President to impose “duties” “not to exceed 15 percent ad valorem . . . on articles \nimported into the United States” in order “to deal with large and serious United States balance-of-\npayments deficits,” subject to a 150-day expiration unless Congress enacts legislation to extend \nthem); id. §§ 2411-2419 (directing U.S. Trade Representative to “impose duties or other import \nrestrictions on the goods of” a foreign country to remedy “unfair and inequitable” foreign trade \npractices, subject to numerous procedural requirements and limitations).  \n27. Absent an authorization such as these, “the President [can] not increase or decrease \ntariffs, issue commands to the customs service to refuse or delay entry of goods into the country, \nor impose mandatory import quotas.” Consumers Union of U. S., Inc. v. Kissinger, 506 F.2d 136, \n142-143 (D.C. Cir. 1974). This ensures that Congress “retains ultimate authority over trade \npolicy.” IRWIN at 21, supra ¶ 25.\n28. With respect to trade negotiations, Congress enacted the Bipartisan Congressional \nTrade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015, Pub. L. No. 114-26, 129 Stat. 319, 320 (codified \nat 19 U.S.C. § 4201 et seq.), which made clear that any trade agreements the President negotiated \nwould have to be approved and implemented by Congress and set forth certain limitations and \npriorities for the President in such negotiations. Insofar as the President negotiates agreements \noutside of this framework, those agreements have no force of law unless and until enacted by \nCongress. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 11 of 37\nB.  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act Does Not Grant The \nPresident Tariff-Levying Authority \n29. Through  IEEPA,  Congress  granted  the  President  power  to  take  specified \nemergency economic measures during a declared emergency. Congress did not authorize the \nPresident to impose tariffs.  \n30. IEEPA  became  law  in  1977.  Both  the  House  and  Senate  committee  reports \n“expressed the view that past Presidents had abused the authority to regulate economic transactions \nin a national emergency” under a different statute—the Trading With the Enemy Act (“TWEA”)—\n“by using it in circumstances far removed from those that originally gave rise to the declaration of \nnational emergency.” Id. at 7 n.51; H. REP.NO. 95-459 (1977); S. REP.NO. 95-466 (1977).  \n31. Accordingly, IEEPA provides the President with authority to take specified actions \n“to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat . . . to the national security, foreign policy, or \neconomy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such \nthreat.” 50 U.S.C. §1701(a).  \n32. Specifically, the President may (1) “investigate, regulate, or prohibit” transactions \nin foreign exchange, certain transfers of credits or payments, and the importing or exporting of \ncertain currencies or securities; (2) “investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, \nregulate,  direct  and  compel,  nullify,  void,  prevent  or  prohibit,  any  acquisition,  holding, \nwithholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, transportation, importation or exportation of, or dealing in, \nor exercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or transactions involving” property in \nwhich a foreign country or national has an interest; and (3) confiscate property of foreign persons, \norganizations, or countries that have “planned, authorized, aided, or engaged in . . . [armed] \nhostilities or attacks against the United States.” 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1). Unlike every statute \nauthorizing the President to impose or adjust tariffs, IEEPA does not mention “tariffs,” “duties,” \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 12 of 37\nor any other revenue-raising mechanism. Compare 19 U.S.C. § 1338(a) (“new or additional \nduties”); id. § 1862 (“duties or other import restrictions”); id. §2132(a) (“temporary import \nsurcharge . . . in the form of duties”); id. §§ 2411-19 (“duties or other import restrictions”).  \n33. The  President,  moreover,  is  limited  with  respect  to  when  he  may  use  these \nemergency powers. IEEPA provides that the “[t]he authorities granted to the President . . . may \nonly be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national \nemergency has been declared . . . and may not be exercised for any other purpose.” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1701(b) (emphasis added).  \n34. Consistent with these limits, no President has ever used IEEPA to impose tariffs \nbefore President Trump’s recent orders. Since its enactment, past presidents have used IEEPA only \nto impose tailored sanctions against foreign nationals and governments to address specific and \ndeclared threats to American national security. See id. at 15. Unlike sanctions, which target threats \noutside the country, the Challenged Orders impose tariffs—causing massive upheaval and harm to \nAmerican businesses and the U.S. economy.  \nTHE PRESIDENT’S IEEPA ORDERS \n35. Since taking office on January 20, 2025, President Trump has issued numerous \nexecutive orders that impose, suspend, or modify tariffs under the purported authority of IEEPA.3\n3 The Challenged Orders also cite three other provisions necessary to impose tariffs under \nIEEPA if IEEPA in fact authorized tariffs: the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. § 1601 et \nseq.) (authorizing the President to declare a national emergency), section 604 of the Trade Act of \n1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. § 2483) (authorizing the president “as appropriate” to “embody in \nthe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States the substance of the relevant provisions of \nthis chapter, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including \nremoval, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction”), \nand 3 U.S.C. § 301 (authorizing the President to delegate functions to subordinates).  \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 13 of 37\nA.   The China IEEPA Orders  \n36. On February 1, 2015, the President issued an executive order imposing tariffs on \nChina. Exec. Order No. 14,195, Imposing Duties to Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in \nthe People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,121 (Feb. 1, 2025) (“February 1 China Order”). \nThe  Executive  Order  asserts  that  “the  sustained  influx  of  synthetic  opioids  has  profound \nconsequences on our Nation,” and that China has not only “fail[ed] to stem the ultimate source of \nmany illicit drugs distributed in the United States” but has actually “incentivized” Chinese \n“chemical companies to export fentanyl and related precursor chemicals that are used to produce \nsynthetic opioids sold illicitly in the United States.” Id. at 9,121. The Executive Order “expand[s] \nthe scope of the national emergency” previously declared at the southern border (i.e., with respect \nto Mexico) to “cover the failure of the [Chinese] government to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise \nintercept chemical precursor suppliers, money launderers, other TCOs, criminals at large, and \ndrugs.” Id. § 1, at 9,122. The Executive Order then invokes the President’s authority under “section \n1702(a)(1)(B) of IEEPA” to impose “an additional 10 percent ad valorem rate of duty” on “[a]ll \narticles that are products of [China].” Id. §§ 1-2. \n37. The 10 percent additional tariffs on Chinese goods took effect on February 4, 2025. \nFebruary 1 China Order § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,122. The February 1 China Order states that, \nshould China “retaliate against the United States,” the President may “increase or expand in scope \nthe duties imposed under this Executive Order to ensure the efficacy of this action.” Id. § 2(c). The \nOrder also makes unavailable drawbacks on duties imposed by the Order. Id. § 2(f), 90 Fed. Reg. \nat  9,123.  The  Order  then  directs  the  Secretary  of  Homeland  Security  to  “determine  the \nmodifications  necessary to the [HTSUS] in order to effectuate the objectives  of this  order \nconsistent with law” and to “make such modifications to the HTSUS through notice in the Federal \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 14 of 37\nRegister.” Id. § 2(d). The Order also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security, “in consultation \nwith the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, and the Secretary of Commerce,” to “take \nsuch actions, including adopting rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the \nPresident by IEEPA as may be necessary to implement this order.” Id. § 4. \n38. Merely a month after those 10 percent additional tariffs took effect, President \nTrump issued an executive order—again under IEEPA—that increased the ad valorem tariff \nimposed by the February 1 China Order from 10 percent to 20 percent. Exec. Order No. 14,228, \nFurther Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s \nRepublic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. 11,463 (Mar. 3, 2025) (the “March 3 China Amendment”). The \nOrder explained that the increase was necessary because the President “determined that [China] \nhas not taken adequate steps to alleviate the illicit drug crisis through cooperative enforcement \nactions.” Id. § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 11,463.  \n39. On April 2, 2025, the President issued an executive order eliminating duty-free de \nminimis treatment of goods subject to the February 1 China Order and the March 3 China \nAmendment. Exec. Order No. 14,256, Further Amendment to Duties Addressing the Synthetic \nOpioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of China as Applied to Low-Value Imports, 90 Fed. \nReg. 14,899 (Apr. 2, 2025) (the “April 2 China Amendment”). \n40. The Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection have \nimplemented  these  tariffs  by  modifying  and  revising  the  HTSUS.  See  Implementation  of \nAdditional Duties on Products of the People’s Republic of China Pursuant to the President’s \nFebruary 1, 2025 Executive Order Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain \nin the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed.

Reg. 11,426 (Mar. 6, 2025) (implementing 20 percent tariff from March 3 China \nAmendment).4\nB.   The Universal and Reciprocal Tariff IEEPA Orders \n41. On April 2, 2025, the President issued an executive order imposing a 10 percent \nuniversal tariff, as well as so-called “reciprocal” tariffs, on virtually all countries. Exec. Order No. \n14,257, Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices that Contribute to \nLarge and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 (April 2, \n2025) (the “Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order”). The express stated goal of these tariffs is “to \nrebalance global trade flows.” Id. § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045. \n42. The Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order declares that the “large and persistent \nannual U.S. goods trade deficits” are a national emergency because they “constitute an unusual \nand extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.” Universal and \nReciprocal Tariff Order, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,041; see Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump \nDeclares National Emergency to Increase our Competitive Edge, Protect our Sovereignty, and \nStrengthen our National and Economic Security, THE WHITE HOUSE (April 2, 2025) (“President \nTrump is invoking his authority under [IEEPA] to address the national emergency posed by the \n4 On February 1, 2025, the President also issued two substantially similar executive orders \nimposing tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, which each rely on IEEPA as \nthe President’s sole source of authority. See Imposing Duties to Address the Situation at Our \nSouthern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,117 (Feb. 1, 2025); Imposing Duties to Address the Flow of Illicit \nDrugs Across our Northern Border, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,113 (Feb. 1, 2025). The President subsequently \npaused, reinstated, and amended the scope of those tariff orders in ways not relevant here.  \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 16 of 37\nlarge and persistent trade deficit[.]”).5 The Order finds that these deficits are caused by “a lack of \nreciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. \ntrading partners’ economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption.” Universal \nand Reciprocal Tariff Order, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,041.The Order asserts that “despite a commitment \nto the principle of reciprocity, the trading relationship between the United States and its trading \npartners has become highly unbalanced” because of supposed tariff and “non-tariff barriers [that] \ndeprive U.S. manufacturers of reciprocal access to markets.” Id. at 15,041-15,042. The Order \nconcludes that “[l]arge and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing \nout of our manufacturing base; inhibited our ability to scale advanced domestic manufacturing \ncapacity; undermined critical supply chains; and rendered our defense-industrial base dependent \non foreign adversaries.” Id. at 15,041. \n43. Based on the newly declared emergency “arising from conditions reflected in large \npersistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits,” the Order imposes a universal tariff. Universal and \nReciprocal Tariff Order § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,044. Specifically, it imposes “an additional ad \nvalorem duty” of 10 percent “on all imports from all trading partners” except as expressly \nexcluded. Id. § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045. The Order modifies the HTSUS accordingly. Id. § 3(k), \n90 Fed. Reg. at 15,047. \n44. The only countries exempted from these universal tariffs are Canada and Mexico, \nbecause goods from those countries are already subject to additional tariffs imposed under prior \nIEEPA orders, Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order § 3(d), (e), 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,046, and Cuba, \nNorth Korea, Russia, and Belarus, because the United States lacks permanent normal trading \n5  https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-\ndeclares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-\nstrengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/. \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 17 of 37\nrelations with these countries, id. § 3(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045-15,046. The Order exempts certain \nproduct categories from the universal tariffs on the basis that they are (or may soon be) subject to \nstill other additional tariffs imposed under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, \nincluding certain steel, aluminum, automobiles, and automotive parts, as well as products like \ncopper, pharmaceuticals, semiconductors, lumber articles, certain critical minerals, and energy and \nenergy products. Id. § 3(b), Annex II, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045, 15,049.  \n45. The 10 percent universal tariffs  took effect  on April 5, 2025. Universal and \nReciprocal Tariff Order § 3(a), (k), 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045, 15,047. \n46. In addition to the universal 10 percent tariff, the Order also imposes a country-\nspecific “reciprocal tariff” on 57 trading partners. Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order § 2 & \nAnnex I, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045, 15,049. The Order modifies the HTSUS accordingly. Id. at § 3(k), \n90 Fed. Reg. at 15,047. This country-specific “reciprocal” tariff ranges from 11 percent for \nCameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to 50 percent for Lesotho. Id. at Annex I, \n90 Fed. Reg. at 15,049. Key trading partners—including those with congressionally imposed \n“Most Favored Nation” status—to whom importers within the United States have sought to divert \nsupply chains in recent years are subject to substantial reciprocal rates. Id. This includes, for \nexample, Vietnam, which is subject to a 46 percent tariff. Id. \n47. Yet these “reciprocal” tariff amounts are not connected to the rates these countries \ncharge the United States. For example, the European Union’s total weighted average tariff rate \nwas recently calculated at 2.7 percent, but the Executive Order sets the “reciprocal” rate for the \nEuropean Union at 20 percent. World Trade Organization, European Union Summary.6 This is \n6 https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/statis_e/daily_update_e/tariff_profiles/CE_e.pdf (last \nvisited Apr. 21, 2025). \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 18 of 37\nbecause the “reciprocal” tariff rates were calculated not by looking at the rates these countries \ncharge the United States or by identifying any specific non-tariff barriers to trade. See Office of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, Reciprocal Tariff Calculations.7 Rather, the “reciprocal” tariff for \na specific country is calculated by dividing the United States’s trade deficit with that country by \ntotal imports from that country, and then dividing by two. Id.; see also Peter Foster & Sam \nFleming, Donald Trump Baffles Economists with Tariff Formula, FIN.TIMES (Apr. 3, 2025).8 The \nresult is an anomaly where the United States’s “reciprocal” rate for a country’s imports may be \nsubstantially higher than the rate the country imposes on the United States’s exported goods. \n48. These “reciprocal” tariffs took effect on April 9, 2025. Universal and Reciprocal \nTariff Order§ 3(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,045. \n49. The Order also directs the Secretary of Commerce and the United States Trade \nRepresentative “to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to \nimplement this order.” Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order§ 5, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,048.  \n50. The only asserted authority for imposing tariffs under these orders is IEEPA.  \n51. The Order also provides that the tariffs “shall apply until such time” as the President \n“determine[s] that the underlying conditions . . . are satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.” Universal \nand Reciprocal Tariff Order § 2, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,045. At the same time, however, the President \nmay, at his choosing, raise the tariffs even higher or broaden their scope: “Should any trading \npartner retaliate against the United States in response to this action through import duties on U.S. \nexports or other measures, I may further modify the HTSUS to increase or expand in scope the \nduties imposed under this order to ensure the efficacy of this action.” Id. § 4(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at \n7 https://perma.cc/WB9J-WWNE (last visited Apr. 21, 2025). \n8 https://www.ft.com/content/85d73172-936a-41f6-9606-4f1e17cb74df. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 19 of 37\n15,047.  \n52. Accordingly, when China responded to this order by imposing retaliatory tariffs, \nthe President raised the “[r]eciprocal” tariff rate on China by 50 percentage points—from 34 \npercent to 84 percent. Exec. Order No. 14,259, Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated \nDuties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People’s Republic of China, 90 Fed. Reg. \n15,509, 15,509 (Apr. 8, 2025) (the “April 8 Reciprocal China Amendment”). This placed the \noverall IEEPA tariffs on Chinese goods at 104 percent (84 percent per the April 8 Reciprocal China \nAmendment plus 20 percent per the February 1 China Order and March 3 China Amendment). \n53. The next day, April 9, 2025, the President suspended for 90 days the “reciprocal” \ntariffs on most countries—except for China, for which he raised the “reciprocal” tariff again, this \ntime from 84 percent to 125 percent. Exec. Order No. 14,266, Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates \nto Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment §§ 2, 3, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,625, 15,626 (Apr. \n9, 2025) (the “April 9 Reciprocal Modification”). The 20 percent tariff pursuant to the February 1 \nChina Order remains in place, meaning the current starting tariff on most imports from China is \n145 percent, though some rates are as high as 245 percent. \n54. The suspension applies only to the “reciprocal” tariffs listed in Annex I to the \nUniversal and Reciprocal Tariff Order. April 9 Reciprocal Modification § 3, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n15,626. It does not apply to the 10 percent universal tariffs from that order. Id.\n55. On April 11, 2025, the President clarified that a variety of technological products \nrelated to computers, data processing, telecommunications, and electronic components were \nexempted  from  the  universal  and  (suspended)  reciprocal  tariffs.  Presidential  Memorandum, \nClarification of Exceptions Under Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, as Amended (April 11, \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 20 of 37\n2025).9\n56. Nevertheless, a 10 percent baseline tariff is being applied to most global imports, \nand products from China are subject to a minimum tariff of 145 percent. \nECONOMIC IMPACT \n57. The Challenged Orders will increase the cost of trillions of dollars of goods and \nservices imported to the United States every year. Ana Swanson, U.S. Trade Deficit Hit Record in \n2024 as Imports Surged, N.Y. TIMES (Feb. 5, 2025) (United States imported $4.1 trillion in goods \nand services in 2024).10\n58. The President has stated that the tariffs will raise “billions of dollars, even trillions \nof dollars” in revenue. Bailey Schulz, Trump is rolling out more tariffs this month. Where does the \ntariff money go?, USA TODAY (April 3, 2025).11 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent estimates the \nUnited States will collect up to $600 billion in tariffs per year. Richard Rubin, Bessent Says Tariff \nRevenue Could Reach $600 Billion Annually, WALL ST. J. (April 4, 2025).12 This money will not \nbe paid by foreign governments; it will be paid primarily by American businesses and consumers. \nSix hundred billion dollars in annual tariffs would equate to the largest peacetime tax increase in \nU.S. history.

(March 31, 2025).13\n59. Raising  revenue  from  tariffs  has  substantial  collateral  consequences  for  the \neconomy. By some estimates, the IEEPA tariffs on China alone will reduce GDP by 0.3 percent. \nErica York & Alex Durante, Trump Tariffs: The Economic Impact of the Trump Trade War, THE \nTAX FOUND. (April 11, 2025).14 The same estimates suggest retaliatory tariffs imposed by other \ncountries will reduce U.S. GDP by at least another 0.2 percent. Id.\n60. The new tariffs will more than triple what the United States would expect to collect \nin tariffs under the status quo. See U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Trade Statistics (in 2024, \nCBP collected $88 billion dollars in tariffs).15 All told, “the imposed tariffs” are projected to \namount to an average tax increase of over $1,200 per American household in 2025. York & \nDurante, supra ¶ 59.\n61. The tariffs will severely and irreparably harm Plaintiffs Learning Resources and \nhand2mind. Because these companies directly import from China (as well as other countries \naffected by the Challenged Orders), they will be responsible for paying at least the 145 percent \nduty and tariffs on all products made in China, with certain products assessed total duties and \ntariffs of 170 percent or more. These rates are so high as to effectively prevent importation. \n62. Having previously planned for sales to increase by 8 percent, Plaintiffs are now \nplanning for a 2025 sales decline of 25 percent to 50 percent year-over-year.  \n63. Plaintiffs cannot continue to sell goods to their customers at the same prices \nprevailing before the challenged tariffs.

Those changes will result in lost sales, lost profits, lost market share, loss of \nconsumer goodwill—and potentially worse. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF  \nCOUNT I \nULTRA VIRES ACTS IN VIOLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL EMERGENCY \nECONOMIC POWERS ACT, 50 U.S.C. § 1702 \n64. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs.  \n65. “The ability to sue to enjoin unconstitutional actions by state and federal officers is \nthe creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review of illegal executive \naction, tracing back to England.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 \n(2015). Accordingly, “[w]hen an executive acts ultra vires, courts are normally available to \nreestablish the limits on his authority.” Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1328 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996). “Congress can and often does cabin the discretion it grants the President and it \nremains the responsibility of the judiciary to ensure that the President act within those limits.” \nAmerican Forest Res. Council v. United States, 77 F.4th 787, 797 (D.C. Cir. 2023); see also \nMountain States Legal Found. v. Bush, 306 F.3d 1132, 1136 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“Courts remain \nobligated to determine whether statutory restrictions have been violated.”).   \n66. The Challenged Orders are ultra vires because, even in the face of an actual national \nemergency, IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose tariffs. \n67. The power to lay and collect duties is “conferred upon the Congress.” United States \nv. Jacobs, 306 U.S. 363, 370 (1939). As a result, the President has authority to impose or adjust \ntariffs only to the extent authorized by Congress. And because the exercise of tariff authority \ncarries “vast economic and political significance”—especially here, where the President has \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 23 of 37\nunilaterally imposed costly tariffs on virtually all goods coming from all countries in what would \nequate to the largest peacetime tax increase in U.S. history—that statutory authorization must be \n“clear.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 716; accord Biden v. Nebraska, 600 U.S. 477, 505-506 (2023). \nIt  is  not  sufficient  that  the  President’s  interpretation  of  the  relevant  statutory  provision  is \n“colorable.” West Virginia, 597 U.S. at 722. That is doubly true where the “claim of expansive \nauthority” is “unprecedented.” Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Department of Health & Hum. Servs., \n594 U.S. 758, 765 (2021). \n68. The plain text of  IEEPA does  not clearly—or even colorably—authorize the \nPresident to impose tariffs at all, much less tariffs of any size, duration, and scope. The statute \nnowhere mentions “tariffs,” “duties,” or other revenue-raising mechanisms. And no President has \nused IEEPA to impose tariffs in the past. Instead, the statute grants the President other defined and \nlimited powers—such as the powers to “investigate, block during the pendency of an investigation, \nregulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit” the “importation or exportation” of \ngoods. 50 U.S.C. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  \n69. The power to “regulate” imports and exports does not encompass the distinct power \nto raise revenue through tariffs or duties. The word “regulate,” in the context of “nullify, void, \nprevent[], or prohibit,” means to directly control the quantity or the quality of imports from one or \nmore foreign countries causing the extraordinary emergency—not to impose tariffs on such \nimports.  \n70. The distinction between regulating foreign imports and imposing tariffs on foreign \nimports dates back to our Founding. Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the Constitution vests \nCongress with the “[p]ower to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts, and Excises.” By contrast, \nArticle I, Section 8, Clause 3 empowers the Congress “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 24 of 37\nNations.” If imposing tariffs was the same thing as regulating foreign commerce, there would be \nno need for the Constitution to specifically enumerate the power to impose tariffs in Clause 1. The \nConstitution treats these powers separately because they serve very different functions and are not \nsubstitutes for one another.  \n71. Indeed, where Congress has granted the President power to impose tariffs and \nduties,  it  has  done  so  through  highly  reticulated  statutory  schemes  that  are  clear  in  their \nauthorization and limited in their scope. Laws such as the Tariff Act of 1930 and the Trade Act of \n1974 provide authority to the President to impose tariffs, but no law provides that authority by \nsaying merely that the President may “regulate” imports and exports. Laws providing authority to \nimpose tariffs instead provide that authority through language that expressly references tariffs and \nduties that raise revenue.  \n72. Moreover, reading IEEPA’s grant of authority to “regulate” imports and exports to \ninclude the distinct authority to impose tariffs would be inconsistent with other terms of the statute. \nFor example, Section 1702(a)(1)(B) explicitly states that the President may only “regulate . . . \nimportation or exportation of . . . property in which any foreign country or a national thereof has \nany interest.” But at the time tariffs would be levied, most goods are the property of the U.S. \npersons that have imported them into the country (or whomever takes title when they cross the \nborder), and not of any foreign persons. It is absurd to suggest that Congress intended to grant the \nPresident the authority to impose tariffs, yet in the same provision precluded the imposition of \ntariffs except in a minority of circumstances.  \n73. For these reasons, this Court should declare that the Challenged Orders are ultra \nvires because they exceed the President’s authority under IEEPA, and that the corresponding \nmodifications to the HTSUS are unlawful.  \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 25 of 37\n74. Because the Challenged Orders are ultra vires, and the corresponding modifications \nto the HTSUS are unlawful, they cannot be enforced by Defendants. This Court should accordingly \nenjoin Defendants (other than the President) in their official capacities as federal officers  from \nenforcing them.  \n75. If the Challenged Orders are not declared ultra vires and the HTSUS modifications \nare not declared unlawful, Plaintiffs will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury. \nCOUNT II \nULTRA VIRES ACTS IN VIOLATION OF THE INTERNATIONAL \nEMERGENCY ECONOMIC POWERS ACT (IEEPA), 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b) \n76. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n77. As set forth in Count I, this Court may review ultra vires acts and provide equitable \nrelief. \n78. Even if IEEPA authorized the President to impose tariffs, it would not authorize the \ntariffs directed in the Challenged Orders because they either (a) do not involve an “unusual or \nextraordinary threat” to the nation, (b) do not “deal with”—or in other words, reasonably relate—\nto the national emergencies that the President declared, or (c) have been employed to take on \nnumerous, unrelated problems for which no national emergency has been declared in the first \nplace. Had Congress intended to grant the President authority to impose tariffs as a matter of \ngeneral economic policy—as the President has done here—rather than to combat an emergency, it \nwould have said so clearly. But it did not.  \n79. IEEPA grants the President authority to regulate various international economic \ntransactions “to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national \nemergency has been declared.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(b); see also id. § 1701(a) (“Any authority granted \nto the President by section 1702 of this title may be exercised to deal with any unusual and \nextraordinary threat.”).  \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 26 of 37\n80. IEEPA also expressly provides that the President’s authority “may not be exercised \nfor any other purpose” and that “[a]ny exercise of such authorities to deal with any new threat shall \nbe based on a new declaration of national emergency which must be with respect to such threat.” \n50 U.S.C. § 1701(b). This requirement that IEEPA action be taken only to “deal with” the declared \nnational emergency, and not for any other reason, is echoed in case law. When the government \nclaims “unprecedented” power over a significant portion of the economy, Alabama Ass’n of \nRealtors, 594 U.S. at 765, its actions must be “[]tethered” to the underlying statutory scheme, \nNational Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Department of Lab., Occupational Safety & Health Admin., 595 \nU.S. 109, 119 (2022); see also United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d 560, 577 (C.C.P.A. \n1975) (holding that tariffs under TWEA must be “reasonably related” to the emergency that the \nPresident declared).  \n81. The  Universal  and  Reciprocal  IEEPA  Orders:  The  tariffs  imposed  in  the \nUniversal and Reciprocal IEEPA Orders do not concern any “emergency” that poses either an \n“unusual” or an “extraordinary” threat. The President admits as much in that order, as he describes \nthe United States’ “annual trade deficits” as “persistent” and rooted in (congressionally approved) \ntrade agreements entered in the first half of the twentieth century. Universal and Reciprocal IEEPA \nOrder, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,041. If the words “unusual” or “extraordinary” are to bear any meaning, \nthe fact that the United States has had a trade deficit for more than 50 years shows that the United \nStates’ current trade deficit does not fit within the IEEPA emergency definition. See Brian \nReinbold & Yi Wen, Historical U.S. Trade Deficit, FED. RES. BANK OF ST. LOUIS (May 17, \n2019).16  Indeed,  the  United  States’  exceptional  economic  growth  over  the  past  50  years \naffirmatively demonstrates that “the trade balance is a particularly bad measure of national well-\n16 https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2019/may/historical-u-s-trade-deficits. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 27 of 37\nbeing.” Andrea Freytag & Phil Levy, The Trade Balance and Winning at Trade, THE CATO INST. \n(Oct. 3, 2024).17 IEEPA requires that there be an “unusual and extraordinary threat,” and neither \nthe trade deficit, nor any of the circumstances that the President asserts cause this deficit, meet this \nstandard. 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a). \n82. Nor  are  the  tariffs  imposed  by  the  Universal  and  Reciprocal  IEEPA  Order \n“reasonably related” to a national emergency. Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 577. The asserted national \nemergency for these tariffs is “the large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits.” Universal \nand Reciprocal Tariff Order § 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,044. Even if the tariffs could address the trade \ndeficit or the circumstances that cause it, the tariffs the President has imposed are incredibly \noverbroad, as they apply to countries with whom we run a trade surplus and to countries that do \nnot charge tariffs on American goods.  \n83. The China IEEPA Orders: The tariffs imposed by the China IEEPA Orders are \nlikewise not reasonably related to the declared drug trafficking emergencies. Imposing tariffs on \nlegal goods has no sufficient connection to combatting illegal narcotics. Most critically, the costs \nof tariffs on legal goods lawfully imported into the United States are primarily borne by Americans; \nthere is no reason why such tariffs and the corresponding harm to American business will alter the \nbehavior of the cartels, drug-smuggling rings, and other organizations that bring illegal substances \ninto our country. Doing so is not “regulating importation . . . by means appropriate to the \nemergency involved.” Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 584 (emphasis added). \n84. The tariffs imposed by the China IEEPA Orders are also unlawful because the \nPresident is imposing them for purposes other than the illegal drug trafficking emergency he \ndeclared. The President has been clear that these tariffs are simply part of his economic agenda—\n17 https://www.cato.org/publications/trade-balance-winning-trade. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 28 of 37\ntheir predominant purpose is not to address the national fentanyl emergency invoked as the basis \nfor imposing them. See Amie Williams et al., Donald Trump Threatens to Ignite Era of Trade \nWars with New Tariffs, FIN.TIMES (Jan. 31, 2025) (quoting the President as stating, the day before \nimposing the tariffs, that “It’s pure economic. We have big deficits with, as you know, with \n[China]”)18; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump), TRUTH SOCIAL (Feb. 2, 2025, 8:09 AM) \n(“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes \n36 Trillion Dollars, and we’re not going to be the ‘Stupid Country’ any longer. MAKE YOUR \nPRODUCT IN THE USA AND THERE ARE NO TARIFFS! Why should the United States lose \nTRILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIZING OTHER COUNTRIES, and why should these \nother  countries  pay  a  small  fraction  of  the  cost  of  what  USA  citizens  pay  for  Drugs  and \nPharmaceuticals, as an example? THIS WILL BE THE GOLDEN AGE OF AMERICA!”).19\n85. IEEPA is clear, however, that the President’s authority “may only be exercised to \ndeal with” a declared national emergency “and may not be exercised for any other purpose.” 50 \nU.S.C. § 1701(b) (emphasis added). The President’s multi-purpose approach renders IEEPA’s text \nsuperfluous: If he can exercise powers under IEEPA not for the particular emergency declared but \nfor any purpose he wishes, the textual limit set by Congress has no force. \n86. Other Deficiencies Across the Challenged Orders: The Challenged Orders suffer \nfrom at least three other legal deficiencies. First, they violate IEEPA because the tariffs they \nimpose apply to imported goods that the statute expressly excludes from coverage. Section \n1702(a)(1)(B) permits the President to “regulate” only property “in which any foreign country or \na national thereof has any interest.” Accordingly, where a U.S. person has taken title to and holds \n18 https://www.ft.com/content/ff8116f0-b01f-4687-934a-a1b8a07bd5b0. \n19 https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113934450227067577. \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 29 of 37\nbeneficial interest in the imported property, no tariff may be imposed. Despite this, the Challenged \nOrders impose tariffs on all imports from China and almost every other country, even if no foreign \ncountry or national retains any interest in the goods. Indeed, tariffs are paid by the “owner or \npurchaser” of the merchandise, which will be a United States person in most instances. See 19 \nU.S.C. § 1484(a)(2)(B).  \n87. Second, the China IEEPA Orders disregard other statutory requirements. They \nprovide that “[n]o drawback shall be available with respect to the duties imposed pursuant to this \norder.” February 1 China Order § 2(f), 90 Fed. Reg. at 9,123. But 19 U.S.C. § 1313(a) provides \nthat when goods “manufactured or produced in the United States with the use of imported \nmerchandise” are exported or destroyed, the tariffs paid on the imported merchandise “shall be \nrefunded as drawback.” IEEPA provides no authority to supersede this provision, particularly in \ncircumstances where no foreign country or national retains any interest in the drawback. Moreover, \nregulations implementing duty drawbacks cannot be withdrawn without notice and comment. \nModernized Drawback, 83 Fed. Reg. 64,942, 64,997 (Dec. 18, 2018); see Rotinsulu v. Mukasey, \n515 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2008) (“An agency has an obligation to abide by its own regulations.” \n(citing Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 265-267 (1954)); Humane Soc’y of the United States \nv. United States Dep’t of Agric., 41 F.4th 564, 569 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (“[O]nce an agency makes a \nrule—that is, once it makes a statement prescribing law with future effect—the APA requires the \nagency to provide notice and an opportunity for comment before repealing it.”). \n88. Third, the Challenged Orders also limit duty-free de minimis treatment under 19 \nU.S.C. § 1321. See, e.g., Universal and Reciprocal Tariff Order § 3(h), 90 Fed. Reg. at 15,047. \nSection 1321, however, states that the Secretary of the Treasury “shall prescribe” regulations \nadmitting goods “free of duty” when their fair retail value does not exceed $800. IEEPA does not \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 30 of 37\nauthorize the President to suspend these statutory provisions. Nor can he repeal these regulations \nwithout notice and comment.  \n89. For these reasons, this Court should declare that the Challenged Orders are ultra \nvires because they exceed the President’s authority under IEEPA, and that the corresponding \nmodifications to the HTSUS are unlawful.  \n90. Because the Challenged Orders are ultra vires, and the corresponding modifications \nto the HTSUS are unlawful, they cannot be enforced by Defendants. This Court should accordingly \nenjoin Defendants (other than the President) in their official capacities as federal officers from \nenforcing them.  \n91. If the Challenged Orders are not declared ultra vires and the HTSUS modifications \nare not declared unlawful, Plaintiffs will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT III \nVIOLATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. § 706 \n(IN EXCESS OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY) \n92. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n93. The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) provides that “[a] person suffering \nlegal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within \nthe meaning of a relevant statute, is entitled to judicial review thereof.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. The APA \nauthorizes judicial review of “final” agency actions. Id. § 704. Courts must “hold unlawful and set \naside” agency action that is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in \naccordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” or “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” Id. § 706(2).  \n94. Defendants’ agency actions implementing the Challenged Orders by modifying the \nHTSUS or otherwise implementing the Challenged Orders and collecting tariffs, as set forth in \nparagraphs 12-21, are “final” agency actions because they finally “determine” the “rights or \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 31 of 37\nobligations” of parties and are backed by “legal consequences.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, \n177-178 (1997). \n95. These actions implementing the Challenged Orders are “in excess of statutory \njurisdiction,  authority,  [and]  limitations”  because  Defendants  lack  statutory  authority  to \nimplement, collect, or otherwise demand the payment of tariffs that have not been enacted into law \nby Congress, have not been duly promulgated pursuant to a lawful delegation from Congress, or \nhave not been authorized by a lawful executive order or proclamation pursuant to a lawful \ndelegation of Congress. \n96. The  agency  actions  modifying  the  HTSUS  explicitly  state  that  they  are \nimplementing the Challenged Orders and cite no other authority—because there is no other \nauthority—for these modifications. \n97. Accordingly,  these  actions  fall  within  Defendants’  statutory  jurisdiction  and \nauthority only to the extent that the Challenged Orders are themselves lawful. But as discussed \nabove and alleged in Counts I and II, the Challenged Orders are ultra vires and unlawful because \nthey exceed the President’s authority under IEEPA. And, as alleged in Count IV, to the extent \nIEEPA does authorize these tariffs, IEEPA is an unlawful delegation of legislative authority. The \nagency actions modifying the HSTUS or otherwise implementing the Challenged Orders are thus \nthemselves unlawful. \n98. Defendants’  agency  actions  are  also  “contrary  to  constitutional  right,  power, \nprivilege or immunity,” id. § 706(2)(B), because, as set forth in Count IV and incorporated by \nreference herein, their only purported source of authorization, IEEPA, violates Article I, § 1 of the \nU.S. Constitution.  \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 32 of 37\n99. For these reasons, this Court should declare that Defendants’ agency actions are “in \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations,” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C), and “contrary to \nconstitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,” id. § 706(2)(B), set modifications to the \nHTSUS aside, and enjoin Defendants (other than the President) and their agents, employees, and \nall persons acting under their direction or control from taking any action to collect any tariffs \nannounced in the Challenged Orders.  \n100. If Defendants’ agency actions are not declared unlawful, set aside, and enjoined, \nPlaintiffs will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable injury.  \nCOUNT IV \nVIOLATION OF ARTICLE I, § 1 OF  \nTHE U.S. CONSTITUTION AND SEPARATION OF POWERS\n(NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE) \n101. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs. \n102. To the extent that IEEPA could be interpreted so broadly as to permit the President \nto impose the tariffs set forth in the Challenged Orders, it violates Article I of the Constitution and \nthe separation of powers.   \n103. The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers” in “Congress.” U.S. CONST. art. I, \n§ 1. This includes the power to “lay and collect . . . Duties.” Id. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1.  \n104. Congress  “is  not  permitted  to  abdicate  or  to  transfer  to  others  the  essential \nlegislative functions with which it is . . . vested,” whether that function is the imposition of tariffs \nor revenue raising. A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 (1935); see \nWayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. (10 Wheat.) 1, 42-43 (1825). Under the nondelegation doctrine, \nCongress may assign modest administrative tasks to the Executive Branch with little or no \nguidance. Once the authority granted becomes more significant, Congress must more specifically \nsupply both an object and a route to guide the Executive Branch’s discretion. And when it comes \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 33 of 37\nto the most important policy questions, Congress cannot delegate the hard choices at all; instead, \nit must answer those questions itself. Cf. Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 U.S. 649, 692-693 \n(1892) (explaining that “Congress itself prescribed, in advance, the duties to be levied, collected, \nand paid on [enumerated products]”); see id. at 680-681 (Congress spent 241 words delineating \ntariff amounts for specific products in the Tariff Act of October 1, 1890). \n105. As construed by the Challenged Orders, however, Congress did not do that in \nIEEPA. According to the Challenged Orders, the President has authority to make major policy \njudgments about tariffs without any guidance from Congress on the amount, the country of origin, \nthe duration of the tariff, or the condition triggering its imposition, and there would be no need to \ndemonstrate that the action taken has any reasonable relationship to the national emergency \ndeclared. Because (under the President’s interpretation) IEEPA improperly delegates legislative \npowers to the President, the Challenged Orders are based on an unconstitutional delegation of \npower.  \n106. Moreover, under existing Supreme Court precedent, a statutory delegation to the \nExecutive Branch is constitutional only when “Congress ‘lay[s]’ down by legislative act an \nintelligible principle” to cabin the agency’s discretion. Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 \n(2019) (alteration in original) (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989)). If \nthe interpretation of the statute reflected in the Challenged Orders is correct, however, IEEPA \nwould not provide the “intelligible principle” for the reasons explained above. \n107. Additionally, the President’s unconstrained exercise of Congress’s power to impose \ntariffs means he may unilaterally and abruptly suspend and resume tariffs with the stroke of a pen. \nHe has already done that multiple times. This “conception of Presidential authority smacks of the \npowers that English monarchs claimed prior to the ‘Glorious Revolution’ of 1688, namely, the \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 34 of 37\npower to suspend the operation of existing statutes, and to grant dispensations from compliance \nwith statutes.” United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, 732 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting). That is not \nconsistent with the U.S. Constitution.\n108. For these reasons, to the extent that IEEPA delegates to the President the authority \nto impose the tariffs set forth in the Challenged Orders, this Court should declare that IEEPA \nviolates Article I, § 1, of the U.S. Constitution; declare that the Challenged Orders and Defendants’ \nimplementing actions are unlawful because they are based on an unconstitutional delegation of \nlegislative power; and set Defendants’ implementing actions aside and enjoin their enforcement.  \n109. If the Challenged Orders and Defendants’ implementing actions are not set aside, \ndeclared unlawful, and enjoined, Plaintiffs will suffer substantial injury, including irreparable \ninjury.\nCOUNT V \nDECLARATORY RELIEF, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 \n110. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference the allegations of the preceding paragraphs.\n111. With exceptions not relevant here, in any “case of actual controversy within [their] \njurisdiction,” federal courts have the power “to declare the rights and other legal relations of any \ninterested party seeking such a declaration.” 28 U.S.C. § 2201(a).\n112. For the reasons stated in the previous counts, there is a real and actual controversy \nas to whether the tariffs imposed by the Challenged Orders are ultra vires, whether the agency \naction modifying the HTSUS violate the APA and IEEPA, and whether IEEPA violates Article I, \n§ 1 of the U.S. Constitution and the separation of powers.\n113. This Court can and should exercise its equitable power to enter a declaratory \njudgment  that  the  President’s  Challenged  Orders  announcing  tariffs  are  unlawful,  that  the \nPresident’s  Challenged  Orders  have  no  legal  effect,  and  that  any  actions  by  Defendants \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 35 of 37\nimplementing the President’s Challenged Orders also have no legal effect. \n114. This Court should grant declaratory relief and any further necessary and proper \nrelief as set forth below, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-2202.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nPlaintiffs request an order and judgment:\nA. preliminarily and permanently enjoining Defendants (other than the President) and \ntheir agents, employees, and all persons acting under their direction or control from \ntaking any action to collect any tariffs announced in the Challenged Orders;\nB. setting aside as unlawful all agency action implementing the Challenged Orders by \nmodifying the Harmonized Tariff Schedule;\nC. postponing the effectiveness of agency action implementing the Challenged Orders \npursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 705;\nD. declaring that the Challenged Orders are unlawful; \nE. declaring that IEEPA does not authorize the President to impose the tariffs set forth in \nthe Challenged Orders;\nF. declaring that, to the extent IEEPA authorizes the President unilaterally to impose \ntariffs, that action violates the Constitution;\nG. setting aside as unlawful all agency action implementing the Challenged Orders;\nH. entering judgment in favor of Plaintiffs;\nI. awarding Plaintiffs their attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in bringing this action under \n28 U.S.C. § 2412 or other applicable law; and\nJ. awarding Plaintiffs all other such relief as the Court deems just and proper.\n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248     Document 1     Filed 04/22/25     Page 36 of 37\nDated: April 22, 2025  Respectfully submitted,  \n/s/ Pratik A.

The President, acting under IEEPA, has regulated \nimports by imposing tariffs on Chinese and other countries’ goods, through a series of Executive \nOrders, to deal with unusual and extraordinary threats to the United States’s national security, \nforeign policy, and economy. \nPlaintiffs challenge the President’s authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA on both \nconstitutional and statutory grounds.  But all of plaintiffs’ arguments concern the imposition of \ntariffs—over which the Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1581(i).  And when the Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction, this Court is \ndivested of jurisdiction.  28 U.S.C. § 1337.  Section 1631 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code requires \ntransfer when there is “a want of jurisdiction” in the original court and when the action could \nhave been brought in another court.  Because the Court of International Trade has exclusive \njurisdiction over the subject matter in plaintiffs’ complaint, the case should be transferred to that \ncourt for any further proceedings, including any threshold challenges.   \nIn fact, the Court of International Trade is currently exercising jurisdiction over three \ncases challenging tariffs issued under IEEPA.  In one case, it has already denied an application \nfor a temporary restraining order and ordered expedited briefing on a preliminary injunction and \nsummary judgment.  If this Court were to also exercise jurisdiction over the identical issues, it \nwould violate the jurisdictional scheme Congress created and could potentially result in \nconflicting judgments, upending U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s administration of the \ncustoms laws.  The Court should promptly transfer the case. \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 24\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Legal Background \nA.  The International Emergency Economic Powers Act \nIn 1977, Congress enacted IEEPA.  See S. Rep. No. 95-466, at 1–2 (1977), reprinted in \n1977 U.S.C.C.A.N. 4540, 4541.  When adopting IEEPA, Congress modified the existing Trading \nwith the Enemy Act (TWEA) so that it applied only in periods of war, but also extended the \nPresident’s authority to periods of declared national emergencies.  See Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. \n222, 227–28 (1984).  Although the broad powers granted to the President under IEEPA are \n“essentially the same as” those under its predecessor TWEA, id.; see Dames & Moore v. Regan, \n453 U.S. 654, 671–72 (1981) (IEEPA was “directly drawn” from the language of TWEA), \nIEEPA provides authority to exercise those powers during peacetime, “to deal with any unusual \nand extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United \nStates, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States,” 50 U.S.C. \n§ 1701(a).  Once the President declares a national emergency relating to such a threat, IEEPA \nempowers the President to “regulate . . . importation . . . with respect to any property, subject to \nthe jurisdiction of the United States.”  Id. § 1702(a)(1)(B).  In full, the relevant subsection \nauthorizes the President to: \n[R]egulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit, \nany acquisition, holding, withholding, use, transfer, withdrawal, \ntransportation, importation or exportation  of, or dealing in, or \nexercising any right, power, or privilege with respect to, or \ntransactions involving, any property in which any foreign country \nor a national thereof has any interest . . . or with respect to any \nproperty, subject to the jurisdiction of the United States[.] \n \nId.  IEEPA also contains narrowly focused exceptions to this broad grant of authority, which, \namong other things, state that the President may not regulate or prohibit “the importation from \nany country . . . of any information or informational materials . . . .”  Id. § 1702(b)(1)–(4).  But \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 11 of 24\nnone of the exceptions involves the President’s authority to impose tariffs to deal with a declared \nnational emergency. \n \nB.  The National Emergencies Act \nThe National Emergencies Act, Pub. L. No. 94-412, 90 Stat. 1255 (1976) (codified as \namended at 50 U.S.C. §§ 1601–51), was an effort by Congress to “establish procedural \nguidelines for the handling of future emergencies with provision for regular Congressional \nreview.”  S. Rep. No. 94-922, at 1 (1976). The statute includes directives for Presidential \ndeclarations of national emergencies with respect to statutes “authorizing the exercise, during the \nperiod of a national emergency, of any special or extraordinary power . . . .”  50 U.S.C. \n§ 1621(a).  Congress did not place any conditions on the President’s ability to declare a national \nemergency.  Instead, Congress committed this determination to the President as “it would be \nwrong to try to circumscribe with words with what conditions a President might be confronted.”  \nNat’l Emergencies Act: Hr’gs Before the Subcomm. on Admin. Law and Governmental \nRelations, 94th Cong. 27 (Mar. 6, 1975) (statement of Sen. Mathias); see also id. at 31 (“[W]e \ndidn’t attempt to define it specifically because we were afraid we would circumscribe the \nPresident’s constitutional powers.”); id. at 27 (statement of Sen. Church) (similar). \nRecognizing that a declaration of an emergency was essentially a political question to be \nresolved by the political branches, Congress gave itself the exclusive oversight authority over a \nPresident’s national emergency declaration.  For instance, Congress directs that a declaration of a \nnational emergency be “immediately . . . transmitted to the Congress and published in the \nFederal Register.”  50 U.S.C. § 1621(a).  Congress also directs the President to comply with \ncongressional reporting requirements pertaining to that declaration.  Id. § 1641(a)–(c).  Congress \nmay terminate a national emergency through a joint resolution that is subject to fast-track \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 12 of 24\nprocedures, and Congress is directed to meet “[n]ot later than six months after a national \nemergency is declared, and [every six months thereafter],” to consider whether the emergency \nshall be terminated.  Id. § 1622(a)–(c).  A declaration of a national emergency also “terminate[s] \non the anniversary of the declaration” unless the President provides notice to Congress that the \nemergency “continue[s].”  Id. § 1662(d). \nII.  Executive Orders Under IEEPA \nAt issue in this case are two declared national emergencies and the President’s actions to \ndeal with these emergencies. \nA.  China Executive Orders \nOn February 1, 2025, the President took action under IEEPA to specifically address the \nunusual and extraordinary threat from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including the \nPRC’s failures to stem the flow of contraband drugs to the United States.  Executive Order 14195 \nof February 1, 2025, Imposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the \nPeople’s Republic of China,  90 Fed. Reg. 9,121 (Feb. 7, 2025).  The President found that the \nPRC had failed “to arrest, seize, detain, or otherwise intercept chemical precursor suppliers, \nmoney launderers, other [Transnational Criminal Organizations], criminals at large, and drugs.”  \nId. at 9,122.  To address the national emergency, the President took “decisive and immediate \naction” under IEEPA and “decided to impose, consistent with law, ad valorem tariffs on articles \nthat are products of the PRC as set forth in this order.”  Id.   \nThe President then imposed a 10% ad valorem duty rate on most goods imported from \nthe PRC and authorized the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to take any necessary \nactions to implement the order.  Id. at 9,122–23.  DHS, through U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, did so shortly thereafter.  See Implementation of Additional Duties on Products of the \nPeople’s Republic of China Pursuant to the President’s February 1, 2025 Executive Order \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 13 of 24\nImposing Duties To Address the Synthetic Opioid Supply Chain in the People’s Republic of \nChina, 90 Fed. Reg. 9,038 (Feb. 5, 2025) (implementing the 10% duty through amendments to \nthe Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States set out in an Annex to the Federal Register \nnotice).  On March 3, 2025, the President amended the order to increase the amount of duty to \n20%.

Reciprocal Tariff Executive Orders \nOn April 2, 2025, the President declared a separate national emergency, finding “that \nunderlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, \ndisparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners’ economic policies that \nsuppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. \ngoods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and \neconomy of the United States.”  Executive Order 14257 of April 2, 2025, Regulating Imports \nWith a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and Persistent \nAnnual United States Goods Trade Deficits, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 (Apr. 7, 2025).  That threat, the \nPresident found, “has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States in the \ndomestic economic policies of key trading partners and structural imbalances in the global \ntrading system.”  Id. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 14 of 24\nIn particular, these “large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits” have \n“atroph[ied]” our nation’s “domestic production capacity” to the point where, now, the United \nStates’ “military readiness” and “national security posture” are “comprise[d]”—an “especially \nacute” emergency given “the recent rise in armed conflicts abroad.”  Id. at 15,044–45.  The \nExecutive Order explains, for instance, that “because the United States has supplied so much \nmilitary equipment to other countries, U.S. stockpiles of military goods are too low to be \ncompatible with U.S. national defense interests.”  Id. at 15,043.  Additionally, “[i]ncreased \nreliance on foreign producers for goods also has compromised U.S. economic security by \nrendering U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geo-political disruption and supply shocks.”  Id. \n(noting the existence of supply disruptions currently being caused by “Houthi rebels . . . \nattacking cargo ships in the Middle East”).  “The future of American competitiveness depends on \nreversing” the hemorrhage of manufacturing and manufacturing jobs to create “the industrial \nbase” the nation “needs for national security,” as well as safeguarding the vitality of the nation’s \nfood and agriculture sectors.  Id. at 15,044. \nAgain, using his broad powers under IEEPA, the President took action that he deemed \nnecessary and appropriate to deal with this unusual and extraordinary threat to the United \nStates’s national security and economy, and imposed a 10% duty on most imported goods.  Id. at \n15,045.  These duties took effect on April 5, 2025, with select countries having additional duties \nimposed on April 9.  Id.  Since the initial declaration, the President has twice taken additional \nactions that he deemed necessary and appropriate to address this national emergency, including \nraising the duty rate for Chinese products. Executive Order 14266 of April 9, 2025, Modifying \nReciprocal Tariff Rates to Reflect Trading Partner Retaliation and Alignment, 90 Fed. Reg. \n15,625 (Apr. 15, 2025); Executive Order 14259 of April 8, 2025, Amendment to Reciprocal \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 15 of 24\nTariffs and Updated Duties as Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People’s Republic of \nChina, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,509 (Apr. 14, 2025). \nIII.  Plaintiffs’ Suit \nOn April 22, 2025, plaintiffs, Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc., filed a \ncomplaint in this Court.  ECF No. 1.  Plaintiffs allege that they directly import from China and \nare harmed by the tariffs because they require “significant and costly changes to their \nbusinesses.”  Id. ¶¶ 61-63. \nPlaintiffs allege that the Executive Orders imposing tariffs on Chinese goods exceed the \nPresident’s statutory authority, id. ¶ 73,  and “violate[] Article I of the Constitution and the \nseparation of powers,”  id. ¶ 102.  They also allege that the named agencies’ actions \nimplementing the orders violates the Administrative Procedure Act.  Id. ¶ 99.  As a remedy, \nplaintiffs ask the Court to:  (1) “preliminarily and permanently enjoin[]” the agency defendants \n“from taking any action to collect any tariffs announced” in the Orders, id. at Prayer for Relief \n¶ A; (2) “[d]eclare” the challenged Executive Orders “unlawful,” id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ D; and \n(3) “declar[e] that, to the extent IEEPA authorizes the President unilaterally to impose tariffs,” it \nis unconstitutional, id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ F.  Plaintiffs also seek fees and costs under the Equal \nAccess to Justice Act.  Id. at Prayer for Relief ¶ I. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \n  Federal courts have an obligation to ensure in each case that their actions are “limited to \nthose subjects encompassed within a statutory grant of jurisdiction.”  Insurance Corp. of Ireland, \nLtd. v. Compagnie Des Bauxites, 456 U.S. 694, 701 (1982).  A plaintiff bears the burden to \nestablish the subject-matter jurisdiction of the district court.  Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., \n511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994); FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 231 (1990).  Under 28 \nU.S.C. § 1631, whenever a civil action is filed and a court finds “there is a want of jurisdiction, \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 16 of 24\nthe court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action . . . to any other such court . . . \nin which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed . . . .” \nWhen courts are faced with conflicts between the broad grants of jurisdiction to the \ndistrict courts and the grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade, they \nshould “resolve those conflicts by ‘upholding the exclusivity of the Court of International \nTrade’s jurisdiction.’”  United States v. Universal Fruits & Vegetables Corp., 370 F.3d 829, 836 \n(9th Cir. 2004) (cleaned up).  Accordingly, when the Court of International Trade appears to \nhave subject-matter jurisdiction over an action filed in district court, “the prudent thing to do is \nto . . . transfer the case to the [Court of International Trade,] so that [it] can determine the \nquestion of its own jurisdiction.”  Pentax Corp. v. Myhra, 72 F.3d 708, 711 (9th Cir. 1995); see \nalso Furniture Brands Int’l, Inc v. U.S. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 804 F. Supp. 2d 1, 6–7 (D.D.C. \n2011) (transferring a matter to the Court of International Trade because it “is the better forum” to \ndecide its jurisdiction).  Such transfer is accomplished through 28 U.S.C. § 1631.   \nARGUMENT \nI.  Transfer is Required Because the Court of International Trade Has Exclusive \nSubject-Matter Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Complaint \nThis Court lacks jurisdiction to hear this case and should promptly transfer it to the Court \nof International Trade. \nThe Court of International Trade possesses “exclusive jurisdiction” over “any civil action \ncommenced against” federal agencies or officers that “arises out of any law of the United States \nproviding for . . . tariffs, duties, fees or other taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons \nother than the raising of revenue” or under any law providing for “revenue from imports.”  28 \nU.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(A), (B).  The Court of International Trade also has exclusive jurisdiction \nover any civil action arising out of any law “providing for . . . administration and enforcement \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 17 of 24\nwith respect to the matters referred to in” any preceding provision of § 1581(i)(1).  Id. \n§ 1581(i)(1)(D).  To emphasize that the district courts lack concurrent jurisdiction over these \nspecialized subject matters, Congress separately provided that “[t]he district courts shall not have \njurisdiction under this section of any matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of \nInternational Trade . . . .”  Id. § 1337(c). \nThe Supreme Court has confirmed that these statutes mean exactly what they say.  When \none of the “grants of exclusive jurisdiction to the Court of International Trade” applies, all other \ndistrict courts are “divested of jurisdiction” over the action.  K-Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 \nU.S. 176, 182–83 (1988).  Other courts similarly agree that “section 1581(i) removes specific \nactions from the general federal-question jurisdiction of the district courts (under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1331) and places them in the jurisdiction of the Court of International Trade.”  Orleans Int’l, \nInc. v. United States, 334 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed. Cir. 2003); see also Conoco, Inc. v. U.S. \nForeign-Trade Zones Bd., 18 F.3d 1581, 1586 (Fed. Cir. 1994); Pentax Corp., 72 F.3d at 711.  \nThus, where Congress has provided that the Court of International Trade is the exclusive forum \nfor challenges to tariffs imposed on imported merchandise, the district courts have no power to \nact. \nThe Court of International Trade’s exclusive jurisdiction over tariff cases serves an \nimportant function:  it consolidates this area of law “in one place . . . with an already developed \nexpertise in international trade and tariff matters,” thus ensuring a “degree of uniformity and \nconsistency.”  Conoco, 18 F.3d at 1586.  Consolidating tariff matters in a single jurisdiction \nprotects the constitutional requirement that “[a]ll Duties, Imposts, and Excises shall be uniform \nthroughout the United States.”  U.S. Const. art. 1, § 8, cl. 1.  If tariff challenges like those raised \nby plaintiffs could be brought in any (or every) district court, there would be a risk of \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 18 of 24\ninconsistent results and different tariffs imposed in different regions of the country, in direct \nconflict with Congress’ statutory design.  Indeed, Congress has consistently placed judicial \nreview of tariff matters in a single forum, beginning with the Board of Appraisers in 1890, see \nCustoms Administration Act of 1890, ch. 407, 26 Stat. 131; then the Customs Court in 1926, see \nAct of May 28, 1926, ch. 411, 44 Stat. 669; and finally today’s Court of International Trade. \nReflecting the exclusive jurisdiction statutes and their underlying purposes of ensuring \nuniformity, the Court of International Trade’s exclusive jurisdiction is broad and encompasses \nconstitutional challenges to tariffs, duties, exactions, and embargoes.  See, e.g., U.S. Shoe Corp. \nv. United States, 523 U.S. 360 (1998) (constitutional challenge to Harbor Maintenance Fee); \nTotes-Isotoner Corp. v. United States, 594 F.3d 1346, 1350–51 (Fed. Cir. 2010) (constitutional \nchallenge to Tariff Schedules of the United States); cf. Arjay Associates, Inc. v. Bush, 891 F.2d \n894 (Fed. Cir. 1989) (constitutional challenge to embargo on imports from certain Japanese \ncompanies); see also Commodities Export Co. v. U.S. Customs Serv., 957 F.2d 223, 229–30 (6th \nCir. 1992).  \nIts exclusive jurisdiction also includes challenges to Presidential proclamations imposing \nduties and tariffs.  See, e.g., Transpacific Steel LLC v. United States, 4 F.4th 1306 (Fed. Cir. \n2021) (Presidential proclamation imposing tariffs on steel under Section 232 of the Trade \nExpansion Act of 1962); Solar Energy Indus. Assn. v. United States, 111 F.4th 1349, 1351 (Fed. \nCir. 2024) (Presidential proclamation imposing tariffs on solar panels pursuant to Section 201 of \nTrade Act of 1974); Simon Design Inc. v. United States, 609 F.3d 1335 (Fed. Cir. 2010) \n(Presidential proclamation modifying tariff schedules); Motion Systems Corp. v. Bush, 437 F.3d \n1356 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (en banc) (Presidential proclamation declining to impose China-specific \nsafeguard tariff); Corus Group PLC v. Int’l Trade Comm’n, 352 F.3d 1351 (Fed. Cir. 2003) \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 19 of 24\n(Presidential proclamation imposing duties on certain steel products, based on Section 201); \nMaple Leaf Fish Co. v. United States, 762 F.2d 86 (Fed. Cir. 1985) (Presidential proclamation \nimposing duties on mushrooms based on Section 201); N. Am. Foreign Trading Corp. v. United \nStates, 600 F. Supp. 226, 230 (Ct. Int’l Trade 1984) (upholding validity of Executive Order \ncausing plaintiff’s goods to be classified under provision of the Tariff Schedules of the United \nStates). \nHere, plaintiffs challenge the President’s authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA and \nchallenges agencies’ administration of those tariffs.  These questions, including all threshold \nquestions, fall squarely within the exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction of the Court of \nInternational Trade because they arise out of laws providing for tariffs or the administration or \nenforcement of those laws.  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B), (D).  This Court thus lacks jurisdiction \nover the case and should transfer it to the Court of International Trade.  The Court of Customs \nand Patent Appeals—the Federal Circuit’s predecessor that heard all appeals from the Customs \nCourt—also adjudicated a materially similar matter under IEEPA’s predecessor statute (TWEA) \nbrought in the right forum.  See, e.g., United States v. Yoshida Int’l, 526 F.2d 560 (C.C.P.A. \n1975); accord Alcan Sales, Div. of Alcan Aluminum Corp. v. United States, 693 F.2d 1089 (Fed. \nCir. 1982).  Other courts have likewise concluded that the specialized trade court had exclusive \njurisdiction to determine whether IEEPA’s predecessor authorized tariffs.  See, e.g., Cornet \nStores v. Morton, 632 F.2d 96, 99–100 (9th Cir. 1980) (affirming district court’s decision that \nclaim seeking recovery of duties paid pursuant to order authorized under TWEA fell within \nexclusive jurisdiction of the Customs Court); Henry Pollak, Inc. v. Blumenthal, 444 F. Supp. 56 \n(D.D.C.), aff’d, 593 F.2d 1371 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  That these courts got it wrong is especially \ndoubtful because Congress later expanded the scope of the Court of International Trade’s \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 20 of 24\njurisdiction when adopting § 1581(i).  See Earth Island Inst. v. Christopher, 6 F.3d 648, 651 (9th \nCir. 1993) (“Section 1581(i) of the 1980 Act also expanded the jurisdiction of the CIT beyond \nthat of the earlier Customs Court.”).  In any event, even before the existence of § 1581(i), the \nD.C. Circuit stated that “only in the [trade court] may an importer seek relief from a levy of \nduties on his importations.  That court’s jurisdiction is not ousted by [a plaintiff’s] effort to draw \nthe statute into controversy, or by his presentation of constitutional issues for resolution.”  \nKocher v. Fowler, 397 F.2d 641, 642–43 (D.C. Cir. 1967); see Bos. Wool Trade Ass’n v. Snyder, \n161 F.2d 648, 649 (D.C. Cir. 1947) (“It is clear that the controversy concerns the duty to be \nimposed upon certain imports.  As such, it is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of \nCustoms and Patent Appeals.”); see also Miami Free Zone Corp. v. Foreign Trade Zones Bd., 22 \nF.3d 1110, 1112 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (after the creation of § 1581, deferring to the Federal Circuit’s \ndetermination of the Court of International Trade’s jurisdiction). \nIn fact, the Court of International Trade is currently considering three similar challenges \nto the President’s authority under IEEPA.  Barnes v. United States, No. 25-0043, ECF No. 3 \n(Compl.); V.O.S. Selections Inc. v. Trump, No. 25-00066, ECF No. 2 (Compl.); Oregon v. \nTrump, No. 25-00077, ECF No. 2 (Compl.).  In all three cases, the plaintiffs, like plaintiffs here, \nclaim that the President was not authorized to impose tariffs under IEEPA.  In V.O.S., after full \nbriefing on plaintiffs’ motion for a temporary restraining order, the Court of International Trade \ndenied the TRO and ordered preliminary injunction and summary judgment briefing, indicating \nthat it is exercising jurisdiction.  See V.O.S., ECF No. 13.  And while the United States has asked \nthe court to dismiss the complaint in Barnes for lack of standing because Mr. Barnes has not \nestablished harm, for the reasons stated above, the consideration of whether to dismiss belongs \nexclusively to the Court of International Trade.  See Barnes, ECF No. 9.  Because the Court of \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 21 of 24\nInternational Trade’s jurisdiction over tariff cases is exclusive, this Court’s retention of this case \nwould require the conclusion that the Court of International Trade has erred in exercising \njurisdiction over the three challenges it is considering.  See Furniture Brands Inter., 804 F. Supp. \n2d at 6 (“[The Court of International Trade] is the court that is far better-positioned to decide this \njurisdictional issue.”). \nMoreover, over the last several years, the Court of International Trade has entertained \nthousands of challenges to various Presidential actions imposing tariffs.  See, e.g., HMTX Indus. \nv. United States, No. 20-00177 (Ct. Int’l Trade); appeal filed, No. 23-1891, ECF No. 5 (Fed. Cir. \nMay 25, 2023) (identifying the 4,100 similar cases stayed pending resolution of the appeal).  \nLikewise, the Court of International Trade routinely exercises jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1581(i) to review agency determinations under the Administrative Procedure Act.  See, e.g., \nSea Shepherd New Zealand v. United States, No. 20-00112 (Ct. Int’l Trade); Maui and Hector’s \nDolphin Defenders NZ Inc. v. Nat’l Marine Fisheries Svc., No. 24-00218 (Ct. Int’l Trade).  This \ncomplaint should be treated no differently.   \nBecause only the Court of International Trade has jurisdiction to hear this dispute \nregarding the imposition of tariffs, this Court lacks jurisdiction, so it is in the interests of justice \nto promptly transfer this action to the Court of International Trade.  28 U.S.C. § 1631. \n   \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 8     Filed 04/24/25     Page 22 of 24\nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, defendants respectfully request that the Court transfer this action in its \nentirety to the Court of International Trade. \nDATED: April 24, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n \nOF COUNSEL:          YAAKOV M.

ECF \nNo. 35.  Defendants’ counsel contacted counsel for plaintiffs on their position, and plaintiffs’ \ncounsel stated, “[p]laintiffs oppose the motion for the reasons set forth in this Court’s May 29 \nopinion and do not intend to file a separate response (unless the Court orders one).” \nCongress has long delegated to the President broad powers to impose tariffs in a wide \nrange of circumstances, including to address national emergencies pursuant to the International \nEmergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA).  In April 2025, President Trump declared that \nnumerous acute emergencies, ranging from America’s exploding trade deficit and the crisis of \nfentanyl importation, should be dealt with by imposing tariffs on the responsible foreign parties.  \nNo one disputes—and no court has questioned—that the President validly declared these \nemergencies under IEEPA and the National Emergencies Act (NEA).  The President deemed \nthose tariffs necessary to correct decades of trade imbalances and asymmetrical tariffs against \nAmerica; to eliminate the drain of trillions of dollars from America’s economy; to reorient the \nglobal economy on a more equitable basis; to strengthen the United States’s defense-industrial \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 7 of 20\nbase to avoid compromising national-security functions; and to induce Mexico, Canada, and the \nPeople’s Republic of China (PRC) to stem the deadly tide of fentanyl and other drugs into our \ncountry.   \nThose tariffs have already prompted dozens of countries to negotiate with the United \nStates to realize historic trade deals.  And the combination of tariffs and future trading \nagreements has also yielded collateral diplomatic benefits for global crises—for instance, by \nfacilitating President Trump’s successful intercession in the burgeoning conflict between nuclear \npowers India and Pakistan.  Lutnick Decl. ¶ 18. \nYet this court issued an incorrect preliminary injunction declaring that IEEPA does not \nauthorize any tariffs at all—even though IEEPA incorporates the same language that Congress \nhas used to authorize other broad tariffs.  That interpretation contravenes IEEPA’s text, structure, \nand history, as well as precedent.  And it defies the separation of powers, overriding Congress’s \ndecision to delegate broad tariff authority to the President—as Congress has done since the dawn \nof the Republic—and instead hobbling IEEPA as an international diplomatic tool. \nThis Court lacks jurisdiction to rule on these issues at all.  The Court of International \nTrade (CIT) has “exclusive jurisdiction” over “any civil action commenced against” the federal \ngovernment “that arises out of any law of the United States providing for . . . tariffs.”  28 U.S.C. \n§ 1581(i)(1)(B).  Five days ago, the CIT held that it had exclusive jurisdiction over a virtually \nidentical challenge because “a challenge to a presidential action that imposes tariffs, duties, or \nother import restrictions is one that arises from a ‘law providing for’ those measures.”  V.O.S. \nSelections, Inc. v. United States, 2025 WL 1514124, at *7-8 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 28, 2025).  And \nthe D.C. Circuit has repeatedly held that the CIT, not district courts, must resolve jurisdictional \ndisputes. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 8 of 20\nAlthough the Court limited its injunction to the parties and delayed enforcement until \nJune 12 to allow for appellate review, a further stay pending appeal is imperative.  By holding \nthe tariffs invalid, the Court’s ruling usurps the President’s authority and threatens to disrupt \nsensitive, ongoing negotiations with virtually every trading partner by undercutting the premise \nof those negotiations—that the President’s tariffs are a credible threat.  Those negotiations \ncurrently stand at a delicate juncture, as four Cabinet members’ declarations underscore.  \nMeanwhile, plaintiffs face no harm from a stay; they can fully remedy any harms by obtaining a \nrefund of any tariffs ultimately held invalid.  A stay of the preliminary injunction would merely \npreserve the status quo during the pendency of our appeal.   \nBACKGROUND \nOn April 22, 2025, plaintiffs—Learning Resources, Inc. and hand2mind, Inc.—sued in \nthis Court, rather than in the United States Court of International Trade (CIT), challenging the \nPresident’s invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose \ntariffs on imports in response to several national emergencies related to fentanyl and reciprocal \ntrade barriers.  Compl., ECF No. 1.  Specifically, plaintiffs argued that Executive Order 14,195, \nExecutive Order 14,257, and other amending orders, each of which modified the Harmonized \nTariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) to provide for duties on imports, are unlawful.  Id. \nThat same day, defendants moved to transfer the case to the CIT.  ECF No. 8.  Two days \nlater, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  ECF No. 9.  After completion of briefing, \nthe Court held a hearing on May 27, 2025.   \nThe Court denied transfer and granted a preliminary injunction.  Dkt. 37.  The court \ninterpreted § 1581(i)(1) to mean that jurisdiction over challenges to tariffs imposed under IEEPA \n“turns on whether,” on the merits, “IEEPA is a ‘law . . . providing for’ ‘tariffs, duties, fees or \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 9 of 20\nother taxes on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of revenue.’”  Id. \nat 13.  The Court answered that question in the negative, holding (unlike the CIT) that IEEPA \ndoes not allow any tariffs.  Id. at 16-28.  In doing so, the Court expressly disagreed with the \ninterpretation of IEEPA’s predecessor statute adopted by the Federal Circuit’s predecessor court, \nand disagreed that Congress had ratified that interpretation by incorporating in IEEPA the \noperative language of the predecessor statute.  Id. at 23-27. \nOn the equities, the Court agreed with the government “that the public has a compelling \ninterest in the ‘President’s conduct of foreign affairs and efforts to protect national security.’”  Id. \nat 32.  The Court concluded, however, that any harm to the government from an injunction in the \nplaintiffs’ favor would be marginal given that the harms articulated in the Cabinet members’ \ndeclarations “will flow, if at all, from the . . . sweeping order” previously issued by the CIT.  Id. \nThe Court stayed its order for 14 days to allow for appellate review.  Id. at 26.  Given the \nsignificance of these issues and the effects of this Court’s order, defendants intend to \nexpeditiously seek a stay from the D.C. Circuit and will relay the Court’s decision on this motion \nto the D.C. Circuit immediately. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Legal Standards \n \n“The power to stay a judgment pending appeal is part of a court’s ‘traditional equipment \nfor the administration of justice.’”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 427 (2009) (quoting Scripps-\nHoward Radio, Inc. v. FCC, 316 U.S. 4, 9-10 (1942)).  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62(d) \napplies to stays of injunctions pending an appeal.  Rule 62(d) provides that “the court may \nsuspend, modify, restore, or grant an injunction on terms for bond or other terms that secure the \nopposing party’s rights.”  Rule 62(e) eliminates the bond requirement “when granting a stay on \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 10 of 20\nan appeal by the United States.”   \nThe four factors relevant to issuance of a stay of a preliminary injunction pending appeal \nare well established: \n(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to \nsucceed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent \na stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies. \n \nHilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, 776 (1987) (citations omitted); see also Nat’l Treasury Emps. \nUnion, Trump, No. 25-5157, 2025 WL 1441563, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 16, 2025).  As discussed \nbelow, all four factors support granting defendants’ motion.   \nII.  The United States Is Likely To Succeed On Appeal  \n \nDefendants are likely to prevail on appeal because this Court lacks jurisdiction over this \ncase and because IEEPA authorizes the tariffs at issue.   \nFirst, this Court lacks jurisdiction to issue an injunction because the Court of \nInternational Trade has exclusive jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i), as \nmultiple courts have concluded.  See V.O.S. Selections, Inc. v. United States, No. 25-00066, 2025 \nWL 1514124, at *7-8 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 28, 2025) (three-judge panel) (explaining in detail \nwhy “[t]he Court of International Trade has exclusive jurisdiction to hear this action under \n28 U.S.C. § 1581(i).”); Princess Awesome v. CBP, No. 25-cv-0078 (Ct. Int’l Trade) (exercising \njurisdiction over materially indistinguishable IEEPA challenge); Barnes v. United States, No. 25-\n00043, 2025 WL 1483384, at *3 (Ct. Int’l Trade May 23, 2025) (concluding the court “has \nSection 1581(i) jurisdiction over this case.”); Webber v. DHS, 2025 WL 1207587, at *6 (D. \nMont. Apr. 25, 2025) (transferring case raising a materially indistinguishable IEEPA challenge \nto the CIT); Emily Ley Paper, Inc., v. Trump, 2025 WL 1482771, at *8 (N.D. Fla. May 20, 2025) \n(same).   \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 11 of 20\nThe CIT has exclusive jurisdiction because IEEPA is a law providing for tariffs, as CIT \nhas held and defendants have argued at length. Significantly, this Court also lacks jurisdiction \nregardless of whether IEEPA authorizes the tariffs at issue.  See V.O.S. Selections, 2025 WL \n1514124, at *7-8.  As explained in defendants’ motion to transfer briefing, and as conceded by \nplaintiffs, the executive orders at issue imposed tariffs by modifying the HTSUS.  ECF No. 21 at \n3-4.  The HTSUS, including the President’s modifications to the HTSUS, is a law of the United \nStates that provides for tariffs.  19 U.S.C. §§ 1202, 3004(c)(1)(C).  Indeed, each executive order \nin question provided that the President’s modifications were made under “section 604 of the \nTrade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483),” Executive Order 14257, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,041 \n(Apr. 7, 2025), rendering each modification a provision of “law for all purposes” regardless of \nwhether IEEPA permits the President to impose tariffs.  19 U.S.C. § 3004(c)(1)(C) (providing \nthat “[e]ach modification or change made to the [HTSUS] by the President under authority of \nlaw (including section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 [19 U.S.C. 2483])” is “considered to be [a] \nstatutory provision[] of law for all purposes”).  This “civil action commenced against the United \nStates, its agencies, [and] its officers” thus “arises out of any law of the United States providing \nfor . . . tariffs . . . on the importation of merchandise for reasons other than the raising of \nrevenue.”  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B).   \nEven if section 1581(i)(1)(B) did not provide jurisdiction, section 1581(i)(D) would.  \nSection 1581(i)(D) provides the CIT with jurisdiction over the administration and enforcement \n“with respect to matters” referred to in the subparagraphs above it.  One of those subparagraphs \nconcerns “tariffs.”  28 U.S.C. § 1581(i)(1)(B).  The jurisdictional grant addresses something \ndifferent from subsection (i)(1)(B).  Subsection (i)(1)(B) grants jurisdiction over, among other \nthings, laws providing for tariffs.  But section 1581(1)(D) captures a wide swath of \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 12 of 20\n“administration and enforcement.”  It does not limit jurisdiction to administration of enforcement \nof only laws “providing for tariffs”—it applies to any of the “matters” listed.  This case is \nundoubtedly about the “matter” of tariffs, and plaintiffs are undoubtedly challenging the \nadministration and enforcement of those tariffs, in addition to their threshold legality challenge.  \nThe President imposed tariffs, which required amendment to the HTSUS, which in turn requires \nenforcement by Customs and Border Protection.  Tariffs cannot be imposed without Customs’ \nenforcement.  This point is reflected in plaintiffs’ decision to name Customs and other agencies \nas defendants in their complaint.  It makes sense that Congress wanted one court to oversee the \nadministration and enforcement of tariffs—without that kind of uniformity, it is possible to have \ncompeting injunctions from different courts.  And that is exactly what has happened here.  The \nFederal Circuit has temporarily stayed the CIT’s injunction, yet this Court’s order conflicts with \nthat stay.  This lack of uniformity threatens chaos and is unadministrable for CBP—and the \nproblem will only get worse as more cases are filed.   \nAccordingly, there is a strong likelihood that the D.C. Circuit will hold that the CIT has \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ claims.  The D.C. Circuit previously affirmed a decision that this \ncourt lacked jurisdiction to consider a lawsuit challenging tariffs imposed under identical \nlanguage in TWEA.  Henry Pollak, Inc. v. Blumenthal, 444 F. Supp. 56, 60 (D.D.C. 1977), aff’d, \n593 F.2d 1371 (D.C. Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 836 (1979) (“The plain words of \n[28 U.S.C. § 1581’s narrower predecessor statute] indicate that litigation involving the surcharge \nprogram belongs in the Customs Court.”); see Cornet Stores v. Morton, 632 F.2d 96, 100 (9th \nCir. 1980) (similar).  Indeed, the D.C. Circuit defers to the Federal Circuit’s determination of the \nCIT’s jurisdiction, even where it doubts the statutory reading in favor of exclusive jurisdiction is \n“the obvious one.”  Miami Free Zone Corp. v. Foreign Trade Zones Bd., 22 F.3d 1110, 1113 \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 13 of 20\n(D.C. Cir. 1994); SCM Corp. v. ITC, 549 F.2d 812, 821 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (even when there were \n“serious questions” about the Customs Court’s jurisdiction, holding that court “itself should be \ngiven the opportunity to utilize its own expertise concerning the applicable statutes, and to \ndetermine whether or not it has jurisdiction”).   \nK Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc. is not to the contrary because, unlike the more recent Miami \nFree Zone decision, the D.C. Circuit, in its underlying decision, did not address deference to the \nFederal Circuit’s jurisdictional determinations.  Coalition to Preserve the Integrity of American \nTrademarks v. United States, 790 F.2d 903, 905-06 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  As a result, the Supreme \nCourt solely addressed a circuit split over the meaning of a fundamentally different tool—an \n“embargo”—which is unsurprising because, unlike tariffs imposed through modifications to the \nHTSUS, the CIT’s jurisdiction over embargos is limited.  K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., 485 U.S. \n176, 183-88 (1988); 28 U.S.C. § 1581(i). \nSecond, these Executive Orders are valid exercises of the broad authority Congress \ngranted the President in IEEPA.  The statute expressly authorizes the President to “regulate . . . \nimportation.”  50 U.S.C. § 1702.  The Court, however, concluded that “regulate . . . importation” \ndoes not authorize the imposition of any tariffs.  ECF No. 37 at 18. \nThere is a substantial likelihood that history will repeat itself and the D.C. Circuit will \ndisagree with this Court’s determination.  That is precisely what occurred in Yoshida.  After the \ntrial court originally held that the “regulate . . . importation” language in TWEA did not \nauthorize tariffs, the appellate court reversed.  The Federal Circuit’s predecessor concluded that \nthe very same language that today exists in IEEPA gave President Nixon the power to impose an \nimport duty surcharge.  United States v. Yoshida Int’l, Inc., 526 F.2d 560, 576 (CCPA 1975).   \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 14 of 20\nAlthough the Yoshida decision is not binding in this Court, Congress adopted its holding \nin enacting IEEPA.  The House Report on IEEPA cited Yoshida and explained its holding, H.R. \nRep. No. 95-459, at 5, as Congress imported the identical “regulate . . . importation” language \nfrom TWEA into IEEPA.  As the Supreme Court has repeatedly stated, “when Congress ‘adopt[s] \nthe language used in [an] earlier act,’” courts “presume that Congress adopted also the \nconstruction given” to that language.  Georgia v. Public.Resource.Org, Inc., 590 U.S. 255, 270 \n(2020) (cleaned up).  This is especially true where, as here, the CCPA was the only federal \nappellate court with jurisdiction to consider the issue, making it “settled precedent,” United \nStates v. Collazo, 984 F.3d 1308, 1328 (9th Cir. 2021), and Congress knew about and discussed \nthe Yoshida decision while enacting IEEPA, H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 5. \nAnd Yoshida’s conclusion that “regulate . . . importation” authorizes tariffs was correct.  \nThe Supreme Court has repeatedly concluded that power to “regulate” commerce includes the \nauthority to impose tariffs.  See, e.g., Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.S. 48, 58 \n(1933).  And if that left doubt, tariffs are certainly a way of regulating importation—the \nterminology that not just IEEPA uses, but also the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and the Trade \nAct of 1974.  19 U.S.C. §§ 1806(2) (“The term ‘duty or other import restriction’ includes (A) the \nrate and form of an import duty, and (B) a limitation, prohibition, charge, and exaction other than \nduty, imposed on importation or imposed for the regulation of imports.”), 2481(2) (“The term \n‘other import restriction’ includes a limitation, prohibition, charge, or exaction other than duty, \nimposed on importation or imposed for the regulation of importation.”).   \nThe D.C. Circuit will review questions regarding these matters de novo and is likely to \nhold not only that this Court lacked jurisdiction but also that the President acted within his \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 15 of 20\ndelegated authority when imposing tariffs under IEEPA.  This Court should grant a stay pending \nappeal.     \nIII.  Defendants Will Suffer Irreparable Harm Absent A Stay \n \nAbsent a stay of the preliminary injunction pending appeal, defendants will face \nirreparable harm when the Court’s temporary 14-day stay expires. \nThe Constitution grants the President the power to conduct foreign affairs and manage \nnational security.  U.S. Const. art. II, § 2; see also Ziglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 123 (2017) \n(“National-security policy . . . is the prerogative of Congress and the President.”); Lee v. \nGarland, 120 F.4th 880, 889 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (“[The Constitution] vests the president with the \nexecutive power, which makes him the organ of the federal government in the field of \ninternational relations.”  (citations and quotation marks omitted)).  Respectfully, the Court erred \nby interfering with the President’s ability to conduct foreign affairs and manage national security.  \nIt should at minimum extend its temporary stay to a full stay pending appeal to limit the \nirreparable harm to national security and ongoing diplomatic efforts while defendants appeal. \nIn the underlying Executive Orders, the President declared national emergencies in light \nof what he found to be unusual and extraordinary threats to national security.  Those findings \ntouched off negotiations with dozens of countries to address the emergencies.  Bessent Decl. ¶ 7; \nGreer Decl. ¶ 9; Lutnick Decl. ¶ 11; Rubio Decl. ¶ 9.  Those negotiations have been one of the \ncountry’s top foreign policy priorities and the focus of much of the country’s diplomatic efforts \nsince early April.  Bessent Decl. ¶ 9; Greer Decl. ¶ 10; Lutnick Decl. ¶ 10; Rubio Decl. ¶ 11. \nWhile this Court suggested that harms to foreign policy and diplomatic efforts would \nflow only, if at all, from the CIT’s parallel ruling, ECF No. 37 at 32, any order calling into \nquestion the President’s ability to impose the challenged tariffs has significant detrimental effects \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 16 of 20\non recent trade agreements and pending negotiations by severely constraining the President’s \nleverage and undermining the premise of the ongoing negotiations.  Lutnick Decl. ¶ 15; Greer \nDecl. ¶¶ 11-12; Rubio Decl. ¶ 12; Bessent Decl. ¶ 11.  Those irreparable harms will become far \nmore severe if the Court’s order is not stayed for the duration of any appeals.  A stay is thus \ncritical to avoid immediate irreparable harm to United States foreign policy and national security.  \nSee Greer Decl. ¶ 12 (warning of “a foreign policy disaster scenario”); Rubio Decl. ¶ 3 (warning \nof “significant and irreparable harm to U.S. foreign policy and national security,” and \n“threaten[ing] broader U.S. strategic interests nationally”); Marshall Field & Co. v. Clark, 143 \nU.S. 649, 691 (1892) (“it is often desirable, if not essential . . . to invest the “[P]resident with \nlarge discretion in matters arising out of the execution of statutes relating to trade and commerce \nwith other nations”).  As the D.C. Circuit has explained, “[t]his country’s interests in regard to \nforeign affairs and international agreements may depend on the symbolic significance to other \ncountries of various stances and on what is practical with diplomatic interaction and negotiation.  \nCourts are not in a position to exercise a judgment that is fully sensitive to these matters.”  \nAdams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 954-55 (D.C. Cir. 1978). \nThe harm to defendants is irreparable despite the injunction’s limitation to duties paid by \nthe plaintiffs personally because, in the national security context, courts must consider the \naggregate effect of such injunctions.  Injunctions of the military provide analogous context:  \nThere, “the court must consider the aggregate harm of all these possible claims, looking at the \ntotal effect of such cases.”  Qualls v. Rumsfeld, 357 F. Supp. 2d 274, 286 (D.D.C. 2005) (cleaned \nup); see also Bors v. Allen, 607 F. Supp. 2d 204, 212 (D.D.C. 2009) (“[I]nterference in military \npersonnel decisions [causes] great harm to the military because of the potential cumulative effect \nof multiple injunctions.” (citation omitted)); Guerra v. Scruggs, 942 F.2d 270, 275 (4th Cir. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 17 of 20\n1991) (finding “substantial” harm to the Army, where upholding the injunction at issue would \nhave a ripple effect, resulting in “a disruptive force as to affairs peculiarly within the jurisdiction \nof the military authorities”); Parrish v. Brownlee, 335 F. Supp. 2d 661, 669 (E.D.N.C. 2004) \n(looking to the proliferation of claims “in the aggregate” in weighing the equities).  The \ndisruption that would ripple out from this injunction, as countless importers and others claiming \nimpact from the tariffs flood the courts, only underscores the manifest harm to defendants.  See \nalso Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008) (cautioning courts to “pay \nparticular regard for the public consequences in employing the extraordinary remedy of \ninjunction”).   \nMoreover, the Court’s ruling impairs the President’s ability to use his powers under \nIEEPA to meaningfully respond to other threats.  The very point of IEEPA, as distinct from the \nPresident’s other tariff authorities, is to enable swift and flexible action in response to national \nemergencies.  The Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized that the national security and \nforeign policy areas present “evolving threats,” Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, \n34 (2010), and the President must therefore have “flexible authority” to address foreign policy \ninterests, Trump v. Hawaii, 585 U.S. 667, 696 (2018).  But this Court’s ruling undermines that \nflexibility.  Other tariff tools do not provide emergency authority to deal with serious threats in \nreal time.  Because they were not designed to address emergencies, their procedural prerequisites \ninject substantial delay into the Government’s response—for instance, up to 375 days, more than \na whole year, under Section 232.  Lutnick Decl. ¶ 14.  Where the emergencies confronting our \nnation include those that in the President’s judgment have “hollow[ed] out” our manufacturing \nbase, rendered “U.S. supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical disruption,” and “rendered our \ndefense-industrial base dependent on foreign adversaries,” Executive Order 14257, 90 Fed. Reg. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 18 of 20\n15,041 (Apr. 7, 2025), the irreparable harm caused by the invalidation of the IEEPA tariffs is \nself-evidently immediate, grave, and enduring.   \nIV.  A Stay Will Not Substantially Injure Other Parties \nIn sharp contrast to the extraordinary harm to defendants, a stay will not substantially \ninjure the plaintiffs.  For any plaintiff who is an importer, even if a stay is entered and defendants \ndo not prevail on appeal, plaintiffs will assuredly receive payment on their refund with interest.   \n“[T]here is virtually no risk” to any importer that they “would not be made whole” should they \nprevail on appeal.  See Sunpreme v. United States, 2017 WL 65421, at *5 (Ct. Int’l Trade Jan. 5, \n2017).  The most “harm” that could incur would be a delay in collecting on deposits.  This harm \nis, by definition, not irreparable.  See Hughes Network Sys., Inc. v. InterDigital Commc’ns Corp., \n17 F.3d 691, 694 (4th Cir. 1994).  Plaintiffs will not lose their entitlement to a refund, plus \ninterest, if the preliminary injunction is stayed, and they are guaranteed payment by defendants \nshould the Court’s decision be upheld.  And defendants do not oppose the reliquidation of any \nentries of goods subject to IEEPA duties paid by plaintiffs that are ultimately found to be \nunlawful after appeal.  Defendants have filed a stipulation to that effect with other importer-\nplaintiffs in Princess Awesome v. CBP, No. 25-cv-78 (Ct. Int’l Trade), ECF No. 17. \nIn contrast, if defendants subsequently prevail on appeal, the unpaid tariffs during the \npendency of the appeal may not be fully recoverable.  Indeed, in the Section 232 litigation, \nTranspacific Steel LLC v. United States, 19-cv-00009 (Ct. Int’l Trade), the United States issued \nrefunds pursuant to the trial court’s injunction, and was unable to recover payment for those \nduties from some importers after the tariffs were ultimately upheld on appeal. \nAs a result, plaintiffs would not be substantially injured and a stay would appropriately \npreserve the status quo until the appeals process has been finalized.  In any event, plaintiffs’ \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 19 of 20\nclaims of irreparable harm are somewhat dampened by their stated preference for dismissal over \ntransfer.  Presumably, if the tariffs threatened their very business, they would have preferred the \nprotection of a transfer to the vulnerability of dismissal.  \nV.  The Public Interest Is Served By A Stay \nThe balance of equities and the public interest—which merge where, as here, “the \ngovernment is the party” against whom an injunction is sought, MediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 998 \nF.3d 931, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2021)—strongly favor a stay.  The public interest requires that the \nPresident be able to take all appropriate and feasible action to swiftly address identified threats to \nthe United States’ economy, military preparedness, and national security.  See Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 24; Nat’l Treas. Emps. Union, 2025 WL 1441563 at *3 (“[P]reserving the President’s \nautonomy under a statute that expressly recognizes his national-security expertise is within the \npublic interest.  To hold otherwise would give to the courts what the Constitution gave to \nCongress and the President.”).  The Court’s injunction impairs the President’s authority and is \nparticularly harmful in ongoing trade negotiations.  It does not serve the public interest for \nsensitive trade negotiations to grind to a halt, or result in unfavorable terms for the United States, \nbefore appellate review of this Court’s decision. \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, defendants respectfully request that the Court enter stay its preliminary \ninjunction order pending the resolution of our appeal.   \n   \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 41     Filed 06/02/25     Page 20 of 20\nDATED: June 2, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n \nOF COUNSEL:          YAAKOV M.

They span the \nideological spectrum, joined not by partisanship but by a common concern over the erosion of \nCongress’s Article I authority. \nAmici do not appear to defend or oppose any particular trade policy. They file this brief \nbecause  they  believe  the  Constitution  draws  bright  lines  between  legislative  and  executive \npower—and that those lines are being blurred in ways that threaten democratic accountability \nitself. \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThis dispute is not about the wisdom of tariffs or the politics of trade. It is about who holds \nthe power to tax the American people. May a President, absent a clear delegation from Congress \nand without guidance that amounts to an intelligible principle, unilaterally impose sweeping tariffs \nunder laws never designed for that purpose? This is not a debate over outcomes but a test of \nstructure. It asks not what should happen, but who decides. \nThe Constitution gives a clear answer. Article I vests Congress—not the President—with \nthe power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” and to “regulate Commerce \nwith foreign Nations.” Unless Congress has delegated that authority through a valid and clearly \nbounded framework, the President may not impose tariffs. As the Supreme Court made plain in \nYoungstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), presidential power must stem from \nthe Constitution or an act of Congress. Here, it does neither. \nIn April 2025, President Trump proclaimed a sweeping tariff regime that touches nearly \n1 \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 6 of 27\nevery imported good sold in the United States. The measures include a 10% baseline tariff on all \nimports and a 34% duty on Chinese goods (raising total tariffs to 65%). These levies did not arise \nfrom legislation. They were not the product of congressional debate or any statutory process. Nor \nwere they supported by specific findings under existing trade laws. On April 9, 2025, President \nTrump announced a 90-day pause on most of these tariffs, except for those on Chinese imports, \nwhich were increased to 145%. The baseline 10% tariffs on nearly every country remained in \neffect. \nBut no statute authorizes what the President has done. The laws cited permit limited and \ntargeted actions under narrow conditions. They do not authorize sweeping economic realignment. \nThey do not permit unilateral taxation of vast sectors of the U.S. economy. These duties came not \nfrom Congress, but from a claim of executive power detached from constitutional limits. \nThe International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the central statute invoked, \ncannot bear this weight. Enacted in 1977 to rein in presidential overreach, IEEPA allows the \nPresident to impose sanctions in response to genuine emergencies—not to reorder the economy in \nresponse to long-term trends.  \nThe  history  is  revealing.  Reacting  to  President  Nixon’s  unprecedented  assertion  of \nauthority under the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA) to impose import surcharges, \nCongress passed new legislation “for use in time of national emergency which are both more \nlimited in scope than those of [TWEA] and subject to various procedural limitations.” H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-459, at 2 (1977) (emphasis added). Notably, the Trade Act of 1974 explicitly granted the \nexecutive authority to increase tariffs in response to balance of trade deficits, subjecting that \nauthority to strict procedural, substantive, and temporal limits (not satisfied here), while IEEPA \nwas  confined  to  non-tariff  economic  sanctions,  To  infer  that  Congress  delegated  sweeping \n2 \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 7 of 27\n \nemergency tariff authority to the President would precisely invert what really happened. Indeed, if \nIEEPA were interpreted to allow the President to impose, revoke, or adjust tariffs at will, it would \nundo the limits on that power embodied in the Trade Act, its sister statute, and produce Nixonian \npower on steroids.  \nThe core principle urged by amici is this: IEEPA and related statutes do not grant the \nPresident the power to impose tariffs of this kind or scope. That power remains squarely within \nthe  legislative  domain.  The  Constitution  places  decisions  about  taxation  and  commerce  in \nCongress’s hands—not as a formality, but as a structural safeguard of democratic accountability. \nThe President’s actions here violate the limits of that structure. The statutes he invoked \nwere never meant to authorize unilateral lawmaking. Yet he used them to bypass bicameralism \nand presentment—the very processes that make government accountable. He now claims an open-\nended emergency power that, if upheld, would let any President reshape the economy without \nCongress. \nTo be clear, amici do not argue that the Executive lacks all authority under IEEPA or \nSection 301. Congress has delegated some powers under specific conditions. But those powers do \nnot include imposing across-the-board tariffs untethered from any statutory criteria. They do not \ninclude the authority to bypass Congress in matters of taxation. And they do not authorize the \nPresident to override constitutional structure by invoking an “emergency.” \nThis case is not about trade any more than Youngstown was about steel or Alabama Ass’n \nof Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758 (2021) was about landlord-tenant law. \nIt is about power—who has it, and who must authorize its use. The principle remains: “[t]he \nPresident’s power, if any, to issue the order must stem either from an act of Congress or from the \nConstitution itself.” Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 585. \n3 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 8 of 27\n \nThis case requests this Court apply the principles which have been reaffirmed time and \nagain: that Congress makes the law, and the Executive enforces it; that major policies require \nexplicit legislation; and that the Constitution does not permit taxation by proclamation. These \nprinciples are neither new nor partisan. They are the foundation of the American republic. \nThe Court should conclude that plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits of showing \nthat the statutes invoked by the President do not authorize the imposition of general tariffs; that \nsuch authority remains with Congress; and that the separation of powers is not a matter of \nconvenience, but of constitutional command. Accordingly, the Court should grant plaintiffs the \nrelief they seek. \nARGUMENT \nI.  Congress, Not the President, Has the Power to Impose Tariffs. \nFrom the founding of the Republic, the power to impose tariffs—like the power to levy \ntaxes—has belonged exclusively to Congress. This is no formality. This nation was born of the \nslogan “No taxation without representation,” which means that the authority to tax, raise revenue, \nand shape the public’s economic obligations must rest with the people’s elected representatives.1 \nThe Constitution is explicit. Article I, Section 8 grants Congress the power “[t]o lay and \ncollect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and “[t]o regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.” \nU.S. Const. art. I, § 8. These provisions were not afterthoughts—they were foundational. As James \nMadison wrote in The Federalist No. 58, vesting control of taxation in the legislature served as a \ndeliberate check on executive power, born of colonial resistance to Crown-imposed duties levied \nwithout  consent.  That  structural  safeguard  ensures  that  only  a  geographically  diverse  and \n \n1 See Michael W. McConnell, THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT BE KING: EXECUTIVE POWER \nUNDER THE CONSTITUTION 100-107, 214-220 (2020) (explaining that the Constitution vests the \npowers to tax and regulate commerce in Congress as part of its core structural design). \n4 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 9 of 27\n \nrepresentative Congress—not the Executive—may impose economic burdens on the people. \nTariffs fall squarely within this constitutional design. If the Framers had merely used the \nterm “taxes,” this would have encompassed tariffs, which are taxes. But the Framers went out of \ntheir way to list “duties” and “imposts” as within the legislative domain. And no wonder: the \nFramers expected that the “impost,” which meant tariffs, would generate sufficient revenue to pay \nfor most of the ordinary operations of the federal government in peacetime. McConnell, supra, at \n101. Tariffs lay at the core of the taxing power.  \nCongress historically guarded this authority with care. The Tariff Act of 1789—among the \nfirst laws passed under the new Constitution—imposed duties across a broad range of imported \ngoods. It was introduced in the House, debated in both chambers, amended, and enacted through \nthe full machinery of legislative deliberation. For more than a century, tariff policy remained one \nof the most visible and contested areas of congressional action, often shaping party lines and \nnational elections. Tariffs were the centerpiece of Henry Clay’s “American System,” and the so-\ncalled “Tariff of Abominations” was the impetus for the Nullification Crisis of 1832-33. Whether \npopular or unpopular, it was Congress—not the President—that decided which goods to tax, at \nwhat rates, and for what ends. \nFrom the beginning of the Republic, Congress has distinguished between delegations of \nauthority to impose taxes, including tariffs, which are the core of Congress’s power of the purse, \nand delegations of authority to impose embargoes and other non-tax economic sanctions, which \ninextricably  relate  to  foreign  policy,  a  largely  presidential  domain.  Both  require  express \ncongressional delegation, but the President has been given far more latitude to impose and remove \nembargoes in the service of foreign policy objectives, while tariff authority has invariably been \nnarrowly limited in time, amount, and purpose.  \n5 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 10 of 27\n \nThe Trade Act of 1974 and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 exemplify this approach. \nThey allow the Executive to address unfair trade practices or national security threats, but only \nwithin carefully prescribed limits. Even then, these statutes do not—and constitutionally cannot—\nauthorize the President to enact a sweeping tariff regime absent new legislation. \nThe Framers’ decision to allocate lawmaking to a representative body and execution to a \nsingle  executive  serves  practical  as  well  as  theoretical  purposes.  Legislatures  –  especially \nbicameral legislatures – are by their nature deliberative, and therefore slower to change course, by \ncomparison to the executive, whose singular virtues include “energy” and “dispatch.” They well \nunderstood what Madison called the “mischievous effects of a mutable government,” and sought \nto guard against it by the bicameral structure of Congress. THE FEDERALIST, No. 62, at 420 (Jacob \nE. Cooke ed. 1961). As Madison explained, “It will be of little avail to the people, that the laws \nare made by men of their own choice, if the laws . . .  be repealed or revised before they are \npromulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is to-day, \ncan guess what it will be to-morrow.” He posed the question: “What prudent merchant will hazard \nhis fortunes in any new branch of commerce when he knows not but that his plans may be rendered \nunlawful before they can be executed? What farmer or manufacturer will lay himself out for the \nencouragement given to any particular cultivation or establishment, when he can have no assurance \nthat  his  preparatory  labors  and  advances  will  not  render  him  a  victim  to  an  inconstant \ngovernment?” Id. at 421-22. So, too of American merchants and manufacturers today, whose \ndecisions are affected by the cost of imported goods and materials. It is not an argument for one \ntariff policy over another to observe the wisdom of the Constitution’s assignment of these powers \nto the branch most likely to pursue a consistent and predictable policy.   \n   \n6 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 11 of 27\n \nII.  IEEPA Does Not Authorize Tariffs. \nThe Administration’s statutory claim rests on the International Emergency Economic \nPowers Act (“IEEPA”), 50 U.S.C. §§ 1701–1707. That reliance is misplaced. Unlike every statute \ndelegating tariff-setting authority, IEEPA makes no mention of tariffs, duties, or imposts. No \nPresident other than Mr. Trump has ever purported to impose tariffs under IEEPA. Christoper A. \nCasey, et al., The International Emergency Economic Powers Act: Origins, Evolution, and Use 27 \n(Cong. Res. Serv. R45618, 2020). The statute was never meant, and has never been understood, to \nauthorize the President to impose or revise tariffs. IEEPA’s text, context, and legislative history \npoint to a different purpose: to empower the President to block or freeze foreign assets and \nfinancial transactions in targeted, temporary ways—not to raise revenue or rewrite the core terms \nof international commerce.  \nAnother statute, the Trade Act of 1974, enacted just before IEEPA, explicitly authorizes \nthe executive to raise, lower, or revise tariffs, subject to detailed substantive and procedural \nlimitations.  To read IEEPA as implicitly granting carte blanche to the President over tariffs \nwithout any such limitations, whenever he declares the existence of an emergency, would render \nthe carefully-wrought provisions of the Trade Act pointless.  \nA.  IEEPA Does Not Mention Tariffs—Because It Was Never Meant To. \nIEEPA grants the President certain defined authorities to regulate international economic \ntransactions upon declaring a national emergency “to deal with any unusual and extraordinary \nthreat … to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President \ndeclares a national emergency with respect to such threat.” 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a). Once that \ncondition is met, the statute permits the President to “investigate, regulate, or prohibit . . . transfers \nof credit or payments . . . involv[ing] any interest of any foreign country or a national thereof, by \nany person . . . subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” Id. § 1702(a)(1)(A)(ii). The term \n7 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 12 of 27\n \n“emergency” does not extend to every problem that is serious or threatening, but only to those that \nare “sudden, unexpected, or impending.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY (2d ed.). The term “regulate \n. . . importation” of foreign goods does not extend to imposing taxes, but in context refers only to \nthe quantitative limitations traditionally part of the President’s foreign affairs authority. See Tom \nCampbell, Presidential Authority to Impose Tariffs, 83 LA. L. REV. 595 (2023). Although Congress \nmay use its plenary taxing power to achieve regulatory ends, the converse is not true: the power to \nregulate is not the power to tax.  \nUpon a presidential proclamation of emergency under IEEPA, Section 1702(b) permits the \nPresident to “investigate, regulate, direct and compel, nullify, void, prevent or prohibit” the \nacquisition, use, or transfer of property owned by a foreign nation or individual.  This enables the \nexecutive branch, in a foreign policy crisis, to block transactions, freeze assets, and seize, or \nsequester foreign property.  See Patrick A. Thronson, Toward Comprehensive Reform of America’s \nEmergency Law Regime, 46 U. Mich. J. L. Ref. 737, 758 (2013) (“The IEEPA thus grants the \nExecutive Branch the power to freeze the assets of, and prohibit financial transactions involving, \nindividuals designated by Executive Order. This includes the power to prohibit bank payments and \ntransfers of credit insofar as they \"involve\" an interest of a designated person, entity, or country, \nand to prohibit the holding, use, or transfer of property implicating a relevant foreign interest.”) \nNotably, Congress employed seven different verbs to capture the intended types of economic \nsanction, but did not include the term “tax” or any of its synonyms. If Congress had intended to \ndelegate the power of taxing ordinary commerce, it surely would have said so.  \nMoreover, all the permitted presidential actions have their effects abroad; IEEPA did not \nauthorize the President to tax or regulate the domestic activities or property of Americans. Tariffs, \nunlike the foreign sanctions explicitly authorized under IEEPA, are taxes paid by Americans. They \n8 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 13 of 27\n \nfall squarely within Congress’s taxing power and, under the Constitution, require the explicit \nconsent of the people’s representatives.  \nThe absence of tariff language in IEEPA stands in sharp contrast to statutes where Congress \nhas affirmatively granted such power. When Congress intends to authorize duties, it says so. \nSection 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 allows the President to “impose duties or other import \nrestrictions.” 19 U.S.C. § 2411(c)(1)(B). Section 201 of that same Act empowers the President to \n“proclaim an increase in, or the imposition of, any duty on the imported article” or to “proclaim a \ntariff-rate quota.” 19 U.S.C. § 2251(a)(3)(A), (B). Similarly, Section 232 of the Trade Expansion \nAct authorizes the adjustment of “duties” on imports, 19 U.S.C. § 1862(a), and grants authority to \n“adjust the imports.” Id. § 1862(c). In each case, Congress spoke with clarity when it intended to \ndelegate authority over tariffs and it encumbered the grant of authority with procedural and \nsubstantive conditions and prerequisites. \nIf IEEPA meant what the government says it means, it would enable the President to \nimpose, revoke, or change tariffs for essentially any reason he describes as an emergency, without \ncomplying with any of the limitations that Congress attached to every statute delegating tariff \nauthority. According to this argument, IEEPA silently repealed all those limits, without any \nmember of Congress seeming to notice. That interpretation is contrary to the time-honored rule \nthat absent “a clearly expressed congressional intention,” Morton v. Mancari, 417 U. S. 535, 551 \n(1974),  “repeals  by  implication  are  not  favored,”  Universal  Interpretive  Shuttle  Corp.  v. \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Comm'n, 393 U. S. 186, 193 (1968). An implied repeal \nwill only be found where provisions in two statutes are in “irreconcilable conflict,” or where the \nlatter Act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and “is clearly intended as a substitute.” \nPosadas v. National City Bank, 296 U. S. 497, 503 (1936). Nor should the court find that the \n9 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 14 of 27\n \ngeneralized language of IEEPA, which does not even mention tariffs, supersedes the specific \nlanguage of laws granting the executive branch only circumscribed authority to impose tariffs.  \nThe more specific tariff-authorizing statutes cannot support the President’s current action \neither. The President has not specifically invoked the authority of Trade Act of 1974 or the Trade \nExpansion Act in support of his April 2 tariffs, and for good reason. Section 122 of the Trade Act \nauthorizes import surcharges of 15% for no more than 150 days “to deal with large and serious \nUnited States balance-of-payments deficits.” President Trumps’s tariffs exceed that limit and \nwould last far longer. Section 201 is even farther afield. It allows targeted tariff increases upon a \nfinding by the United States International Trade Commission that increased imports of a product \nare causing substantial injury to the domestic industry producing that product. There have been no \nsuch findings here. Indeed, across-the-board tariffs of 10% on all imports – including nations \nwhere the United States enjoys a trade surplus – bear no resemblance to the targeted tariff increases \ncontemplated  by  this  provision.  Section  301  of  the  Act  authorizes  “duties  or  other  import \nrestrictions” on foreign nations that have been found—after notice and investigation—to have \ncommitted unfair trade practices or violated trade agreements with the United States. There have \nbeen no such investigations, and no notice to the nations involved. In any event, this provision has \nlargely been superseded by investigations and proceedings under the World Trade Organization \nframework. Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act concerns national security threats, yet no \nplausible finding has been made—or could be made—that every product from every nation in the \nworld poses such a threat. The Administration has not even invoked these statutes in support of \nthe tariffs at issue. Their existence, however, makes it even more implausible that IEEPA silently \nconveys limitless powers that these statutes convey only through express, narrow limits and \naccompanied by procedural safeguards.   \n10 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 15 of 27\n \nB.  Congress Deliberately Rejected Tariff Authority In IEEPA. \nThe context of the enactment of IEEPA makes clear that Congress did not intend to \ndelegate tariff authority to the President. On the contrary, Congress enacted IEEPA in 1977 in \nresponse to President Richard Nixon’s unprecedented assertion of the authority to increase tariffs \nunder the Trading With The Enemy Act of 1917 (TWEA), Pub. L. No. 65-91, 40 Stat. 411 (1917), \nin 1971. The TWEA, a World War I–era statute that originally applied only in wartime, gave the \nPresident authority to impose economic sanctions against other nations whose actions threaten our \nnational security. The TWEA did not mention tariffs, and until 1971 was never invoked by any \nPresident to impose them.  \nIn that year, President Nixon declared a national emergency and imposed a 10% import \nsurcharge (an extra tariff), purportedly under the authority of the TWEA. Nixon asserted that \nlanguage in the TWEA allowing the executive to “regulate . . . imports . . . by means of instructions, \nlicenses, or otherwise” was broad enough to permit him to add a 10% surcharge to the existing \ntariffs that had been imposed by Congress. This surcharge lasted less than five months; it was \nwithdrawn  in  December  1971.  A  zipper  importer,  Yoshida  International,  filed  a  lawsuit \nchallenging the legality of the surcharge and seeking a refund of taxes paid. By the time a court \ncould render a decision, the import surcharge had lapsed. Although a three-judge panel of the \nCustoms Court concluded that the tariff surcharge was illegal, Yoshida Int’l, Inc. v. United States, \n378 F.Supp. 1155 (C.C. 1974), the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals later reversed, upholding \nNixon’s action. It found that TWEA’s “express delegation” of power to the President “is broad \nindeed,” such that the power to impose tariffs could be inferred from the power to “regulate” \nimports during a crisis, in the absence of any statute “’providing procedures’ for dealing with a \nnational emergency involving a balance of payments problem such as that which existed in 1971.” \nYoshida Int’l, Inc. v. United States, 526 F.2d 560, 574–75 (C.C.P.A. 1975), quoting Youngstown \n11 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 16 of 27\n \nSheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952) (“legislation delegating restrictive regulatory \nauthority cannot operate, merely upon the declaration of an emergency, to the exclusion of other \nlegislative acts providing procedures prescribed by the Congress for the accomplishment of the \nvery purpose sought to be attained by Presidential Proclamation”).2  \nWhile the Yoshida litigation was still pending, Congress passed just such a statute. It \nrepealed the TWEA, replacing it with the Trade Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-618, § 122, 88 Stat. \n1978, 1991 (codified at 19 U.S.C. § 2132), which for the first time gave the executive explicit \nauthority to revise tariffs in response to trade deficits – the very power President Nixon had \nasserted under the TWEA, subject to strict substantive and procedural guardrails. The Trade Act \nallowed the President to increase tariffs through an emergency import surcharge, but capped such \nsurcharges at 15% and permitted them to last no more than 150 days in the absence of “affirmative \nauthorization” by Congress. Id. Moreover, the Act required specific findings of unfair trade \npractices by the nations subject to the surcharges. Congress thus made clear that if a President is \nto have any emergency tariff power, it must come from a specifically tailored statute with clear \nparameters, not an open-ended mandate.  \nOnly after Congress passed the Trade Act did the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals \nreverse the trial court’s holding that the TWEA did not authorize presidential tariff increases. \nYoshida, supra. By that time, Congress had already enacted a carefully limited tariff authority, \n \n2 In Yoshida, the court upheld President Nixon’s import surcharge precisely because it adhered to \npreviously established congressional tariff limits. Nixon’s surcharge applied only to goods \nalready benefiting from tariff reductions, and crucially, rates could never exceed Congress’s \noriginal statutory maximum. By contrast, President Trump’s tariffs far exceed any previously \nauthorized congressional tariff ceilings, are not limited to goods previously receiving tariff \nconcessions, and impose new duties broadly and independently from any prior legislative \nframework. This difference underscores why the Yoshida precedent does not support the \nAdministration’s expansive interpretation of executive tariff power here. \n12 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 17 of 27\n \nwhich superseded the TWEA.  \nCongress then enacted IEEPA. Having just enacted an explicit, and tightly limited, tariff \nauthority through the Trade Act, Congress did not incorporate any tariff language into IEEPA. \nCongress’s decision in 1977 to retain TWEA’s general language (“regulate importation…”) in \nIEEPA without adding any tariff-specific provision strongly suggests that lawmakers did not \nregard IEEPA as a vehicle for import taxes. Congress had already “provided procedures” for \nemergency tariffs. Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 578, and those procedures – not IEEPA – would govern \nfuture imposition of tariffs “dealing with a national emergency involving a balance of payments \nproblem.” Id. IEEPA was meant for other tools of economic sanctions (like freezing assets or \nembargoing particular transactions), not for across-the-board duties. \nCongress further cut back on the power previously imparted by the TWEA in two ways. \nFirst, it confined the original TWEA power to wartime, as had been the case between 1917 and \n1933. See 50 U.S.C. § 4302. In peacetime, the President was permitted to impose regulations (with \nno mention of tariffs) on imports only upon a declaration of emergency under the Emergencies \nAct, which would be subject to fast-track review and invalidation by Congress. See Thronson, 46  \nU. Mich. J. L. Ref. at 743-53.  This effectively barred any future action of the sort taken by \nPresident Nixon, unless it was approved by Congress.  \nOver a decade later, the Supreme Court declared legislative vetoes (like the one employed \nin the Emergencies Act) unconstitutional, which stripped Congress of the central safeguard it had \nenacted in 1977. INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983). It is nonetheless a fallacy to impute to \nCongress the intention to give the President unilateral tariff authority, when Congress voted \nspecifically to subject any such decisions to congressional review.  \nThe House Committee Report leaves no ambiguity: IEEPA was designed to provide “a \n13 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 18 of 27\n \nnew set of authorities for use in time of national emergency which are both more limited in scope \nthan those of [TWEA] and subject to various procedural limitations.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 2 \n(1977) (emphasis added). The Report expressed Congress’s view that President Nixon had used \nthe TWEA for purposes “which would not be contemplated in normal times.” Id.  at 5.  The Senate \nCommittee Report similarly emphasized that IEEPA should not be read to provide “a blank check \nfor presidential control over the economy.” S. Rep. No. 95-466, at 5–6 (1977).  \nNothing  in  IEEPA’s  legislative  history  suggests  that  Congress  intended  to  give  the \nPresident tariff-making power. The House Report accompanying the bill identified the key powers \ncarried over from TWEA that were deemed necessary for emergencies: controls on foreign \nexchange transactions, banking transfers, and securities; regulation of property in which foreign \nnationals have an interest; vesting (seizing) foreign-owned property; and handling or liquidating \nsuch property for the United States’ benefit. See H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 1–2 (1977). Notably \nabsent from that list is any power to raise import duties or impose new tariffs. In fact, tariffs are \nonly addressed in a historical discussion of past uses of TWEA, not as a contemplated feature of \nIEEPA. See id. at 5–6.  \nC.  The Government’s Contrary Arguments Lack Merit. \nThe slender thread on which the government bases its reliance on IEEPA is that Congress \nused the same the term, “regulate . . . imports,” in IEEPA that had been present in the TWEA, and \nwhich Yoshida held had supported Nixon’s tariff surcharges.  The government asks this court to \ninfer that IEEPA has the same meaning as the TWEA and that Congress must have embraced the \nbroad interpretation of that language in Yoshida. There are multiple reasons to reject that argument. \nFirst, the court should interpret IEEPA in light of its language, and not according to \nspeculation that Congress might have accepted the interpretation given by one lower court to a \ndifferent statute, now repealed. That is especially clear because we know that Congress explicitly \n14 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 19 of 27\n \nset out to cabin that authority, and substitute authorities “which are both more limited in scope \nthan those of [TWEA] and subject to various procedural limitations.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-459, at 2 \n(1977). It would turn the congressional intention on its head to read IEEPA as preserving the same \nunbridled power that Nixon had asserted.  \nSecond, the court should not read IEEPA as giving the President sweeping tariff powers \nwhen Congress had just enacted the Trade Act, which subjected presidential tariff authority to \nstrict substantive and procedural limits. The government’s interpretation would amount to an \nimplied repeal of the Trade Act and virtually every other tariff-specific delegation of power. As \nJustice Frankfurter noted in Youngstown, “It is quite impossible, however, when Congress did \nspecifically address itself to a problem, as Congress did to that of seizure, to find secreted in the \ninterstices of legislation the very grant of power which Congress consciously withheld.” 343 U.S. \nat 609.  \nThird, the Yoshida court expressly repudiated the notion that the TWEA empowered the \nPresident to “impos[e] whatever tariff rates he deems desirable,” which is the power claimed by \nthe government in this case. Yoshida, 526 F.2d at 578. The court emphasized the narrow and time-\nlimited nature of the Nixon tariff surcharge, and limited its holding accordingly. The court noted \nthat Nixon’s Executive Order “was limited to articles which had been the subject of prior tariff \nconcessions” and that the total tariff, with the surcharge, could not exceed the amount Congress \nhad enacted in “column 2 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States.” Id. at 577.  The surcharge \nlasted less than five months. “Far from attempting, therefore, to tear down or supplant the entire \ntariff scheme of Congress, the President imposed a limited surcharge, as ‘a temporary measure’ \ncalculated to help meet a particular national emergency.” Id. Indeed, the court suggested that such \na broad interpretation might render the statute unconstitutional. Id. at 580-583. To make this point \n15 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 20 of 27\n \ncrystal clear, the court declared that “[t]he declaration of a national emergency is not a talisman \nenabling the President to rewrite the tariff schedules.” Id. at 583. Thus, even if this court were to \nconclude that Congress somehow incorporated the Yoshida court’s interpretation of the TWEA \ninto the new IEEPA statute, this would not support the government’s extravagant claim of an \nunlimited power to set tariffs in any declared emergency.  \nThe Yoshida court further emphasized, no fewer than four times in its opinion, that the \ngeneralized provisions of the TWEA could be read to authorize President Nixon’s action only \nbecause there then existed no statute containing “procedures prescribed by the Congress for the \naccomplishment of the very purpose sought to be attained by [the presidential order].” 526 F.2d at \n570, 578. A specific statute would govern instead of the TWEA. Congress thus knew that its \nenactment of precisely such procedures in the Trade Act of 1974 would preclude a finding of \ngeneralized tariff authority under the TWEA, under the logic and holding of Yoshida.   \nThe government simply ignores the congressional opposition to the Nixonian tariffs, the \nenactment of time-limited and procedurally limited tariff authority in the Trade Act, and the \nelimination of unilateral presidential emergency authority through the fast-track congressional \ndisapproval  mechanism  of  the  Emergency  Act.  To  be  sure,  the  congressional  disapproval \nprocedure was rendered ineffective by the Chadha decision, but that decision came a decade later, \nand it defies reason to impute to Congress the intention to give to the President precisely the \nunilateral authority it so carefully (if ineffectually) curtailed.  \n   \n16 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 21 of 27\n \nD.  These Tariffs Are Permanent Policy Rather Than Emergency Measures. \nIEEPA was enacted to enable short-term, targeted responses to genuine, extraordinary \nthreats—not to authorize permanent alterations to the nation’s trade regime. Its very title—the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act—underscores this purpose: to grant the Executive \nnarrow powers to act swiftly during unforeseen emergencies. It is not a tool for addressing long-\nstanding policy concerns or for implementing structural reforms that require legislative debate. \nThe tariffs imposed by the President in April 2025 are plainly at odds with that purpose. \nThey are not tied to a discrete or time-sensitive emergency. Nor are they temporary. On the \ncontrary, they are designed to remain in effect indefinitely and to respond to broad, persistent \nconditions—such as global supply chain realignment, foreign industrial policy, and chronic trade \nimbalances—that the Administration claims threaten American economic security in a general and \nenduring way. \nPresident Trump has made no effort to conceal this long-term intent. He has explicitly \ndefended his tariff policy as a corrective to economic trends spanning more than two decades. The \nofficial White House Fact Sheet explains that the President invoked IEEPA to address “the national \nemergency posed by the large and persistent trade deficit.” It claims that “[f]or generations, \ncountries have taken advantage of the United States,” and cites the loss of “around 5 million \nmanufacturing jobs” from 1997 to 2024—a 27-year period. It also references Chinese trade \npractices  “between  2001  and  2018”—conduct  that  began  nearly  a  quarter  century  ago  and \nconcluded seven years prior. 3 These are not unforeseen emergencies. They are longstanding policy \n \n3 See Fact Sheet: President Donald J. Trump Declares National Emergency to Increase Our \nCompetitive Edge, Protect Our Sovereignty, and Strengthen Our National and Economic \nSecurity, The White House (Apr. 2, 2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-\nsheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-\nprotect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/. \n17 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 22 of 27\n \ngrievances, best addressed by Congress—not by emergency proclamation. \nThe Administration has also touted these tariffs as a means of generating long-term \nrevenue. On April 2, President Trump predicted that the tariffs would generate “trillions and \ntrillions of dollars to reduce our taxes and pay down our national debt.” The Chair of the Council \nof Economic Advisors echoed this aim, stating that “tariffs will help pay for both tax cuts and \ndeficit reduction.” 4 But tax cuts and budget deficits—however important—are not “unusual and \nextraordinary threat[s]” under IEEPA. 50 U.S.C. § 1701(a). They are routine subjects of political \ndebate and legislative negotiation. Their invocation here confirms that these tariffs are not \ntemporary emergency measures, but a shift in fiscal and trade policy pursued through unilateral \nexecutive action. \nE.  No President Has Ever Used IEEPA This Way. \nThe Supreme Court has cautioned that “[w]hen an agency claims to discover in a long-\nextant statute an unheralded power to regulate ‘a significant portion of the American economy,’ \n… we typically greet its announcement with a measure of skepticism.” Util. Air Regul. Group \n(UARG) v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302, 324 (2014) (quoting FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., \n529 U.S. 120, 159 (2000)). That skepticism is warranted here. In the nearly five decades since its \nenactment, IEEPA has never been used to impose a general tariff. Presidents have invoked it to \nfreeze assets, block financial transfers, and impose targeted sanctions on hostile regimes and \nindividuals. But never to levy broad-based duties on imports. That settled practice confirms what \nthe statute’s text and legislative record already show: Congress did not grant tariff authority. \n   \n \n4 CEA Chairman Steve Miran, Hudson Institute Event Remarks, The White House (Apr. 7, \n2025), https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/2025/04/cea-chairman-steve-miran-\nhudson-institute-event-remarks/. \n18 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 23 of 27\n \nF.  The Court Has Repeatedly Rejected Sweeping Power From Ambiguous Text. \nIn matters of vast political and economic consequence, the Supreme Court insists on \nunmistakable legislative authority before allowing the Executive Branch to act. It is not a novel \ndoctrine but a longstanding interpretive principle: it is improbable that Congress means to transfer \nvast swaths of its constitutional power without saying so directly. General language will not \nsuffice. The point here is not (as with the nondelegation doctrine) to limit Congress’s ability to \nlegislate, but to protect Congress from having its words twisted to unintended purposes. \nThat principle, dubbed the “major questions doctrine,” applies with full force here. The \nPresident has proclaimed a fundamental reordering of U.S. trade policy: a baseline 10% tariff on \nnearly all imports, a 34% tariff on Chinese goods, and a 25% tariff on foreign automobiles—\nwithout  new  legislation  or  specific  congressional  approval.  The  asserted  authority  rests  on \nstatutory language not enacted for this purpose and never before used in this way. That, under \nbinding precedent, is not enough. \nThe Court applied this principle decades ago in Brown & Williamson. There, it rejected the \nFDA’s attempt to regulate tobacco under broad statutory language, noting that Congress had \nlegislated extensively in the area without granting that power. “[Congress] could not have intended \nto delegate a decision of such economic and political significance in so cryptic a fashion.” 529 \nU.S. at 160. The Court refused to assume that Congress had granted sweeping authority without \nsaying so. As the Court warned, Congress does not “hide elephants in mouseholes.” Whitman v. \nAm. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001). \nIn Alabama Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758 (2021), the \nCourt struck down the CDC’s attempt to extend a nationwide eviction moratorium under general \npublic health authority. The relevant statute allowed measures to prevent disease transmission, but \nnone of the enumerated measures bore any resemblance to moratorium on evictions. That mattered. \n19 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 24 of 27\n \nThe  Court  emphasized  that  sweeping  economic  actions  require  unmistakable  legislative \napproval—particularly where Congress had considered and declined to extend the policy itself. \nThe CDC’s reliance on broad language was not enough. \nSimilarly, Nat’f Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Dep’t of Labor, 595 U.S. 109 (2022), invalidated \nOSHA’s nationwide vaccine-or-test mandate, holding that such a significant policy required \nexplicit congressional authorization. Though OSHA invoked its general authority to regulate \nworkplace safety, the Court found that such sweeping measures could not rest on generalized \nstatutory terms. The Executive may not transform a broad statute into a blank check for nationwide \nregulation—particularly when fundamental personal and economic rights are at stake.  \nThe situation here is analogous to these cases. Like the CDC, the President relies on a few \ngeneralized words (“regulate” and “importation”) in a statute designed for narrow, targeted \nemergencies  to  justify  a  dramatic,  long-term  economic  intervention.  And  as  in  Alabama \nAssociation,  Congress  has  not  merely  failed  to  speak  clearly—it  has  expressly  declined  to \nauthorize the action now claimed. Cf. Youngstown, 343 U.S. at 586 (noting that Congress had \nconsidered and declined to grant the President authority to seize private property in response to \nlabor disputes). When faced with Richard Nixon’s unprecedented assertion of a unilateral tariff \npower under the TWEA, Congress repealed the TWEA and replaced it with the Trade Act, which \nallowed adjustment of tariffs under strict procedural, substantive, and temporal limitations, enacted \nIEEPA to address non-tariff economic sanctions, and subjected all emergency declarations to \ndirect  congressional  control.  That  history  cannot  be  rewritten  by  implication  or  executive \ninterpretation. \nInterpreting IEEPA to authorize tariffs would also invite a grave nondelegation problem. \nThe statute supplies no intelligible principle to guide the President in determining when, how, or \n20 \n \nDCACTIVE-80115111.2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01248-RC     Document 23     Filed 05/07/25     Page 25 of 27\n \nto what extent duties should be imposed If construed to allow the imposition of tariffs without \nmeaningful limits or standards, IEEPA would amount to an open-ended delegation of legislative \npower—precisely what the nondelegation doctrine forbids. In J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United \nStates, 276 U.S. 394 (1928), the Court upheld a tariff delegation only because it was governed by \nan “intelligible principle” and confined to narrow bounds. As the Court explained in Whitman v. \nAmerican Trucking Associations, Congress must “lay down by legislative act an intelligible \nprinciple to which the person or body authorized to [act] is directed to conform.” 531 U.S. 457, \n472 (2001) (citation omitted). That principle is absent here with respect to trade duties. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reject the government vision of executive power—not merely because it \nlacks statutory support, but because it permits arbitrary taxation untethered from the constitutional \nprocesses designed to safeguard liberty. The separation of powers remains the first and strongest \nsafeguard of liberty in a constitutional republic. It must be upheld here. \nThe Court should grant plaintiffs’ request for relief because plaintiffs are likely to succeed \non the merits.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n      /s/ Daniel W.
