    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the Trump Administration&rsquo;s so-called Department of Government Efficiency&rsquo;s (DOGE) practice of using ephemeral platforms such as Signal and Google Docs to transact official government business, allegedly in contravention of the record-keeping and disclosure requirements of the Federal Records Act (FRA) and the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Plaintiff American Oversight, a nonpartisan nonprofit seeking to advance democracy and transparency by enforcing public rights to government documents, brought this case under FOIA and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), further alleging that defendants failed to conduct adequate searches for responsive records to FOIA requests and wrongfully withheld non-exempt records.</p>\r\n<p>Plaintiff filed this lawsuit on April 23, 2025, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The lawsuit named DOGE, its leader Elon Musk, several other DOGE officials, the National Archives &amp; Records Administration (NARA), and NARA&rsquo;s acting archivist Marco Rubio as defendants. Plaintiff sought a declaration that use of Signal and Google Docs was subject to the FRA and that failure to preserve and record such documents constituted a violation of the FRA and of the APA. Plaintiff also sought an order compelling DOGE to comply with its FOIA requests and an injunction preventing DOGE from continued withholding of FOIA-covered materials. Plaintiff finally sought attorneys&rsquo; fees. The case was assigned to Judge Rudolph Contreras.</p>\r\n<p>On July 1, 2025, defendants moved to dismiss the case. Defendants argued that DOGE (officially the United States DOGE Service, or USDS) was not an \"agency\" sufficiently independent of the President to be subject to FOIA; that plaintiff did not have a right of action under the FRA; that plaintiff's claim against NARA was conclusory and failed to allege that defendants used Signal unlawfully; and that some of plaintiff's claims were barred under the APA because FOIA itself provided a remedy.</p>\r\n<p>On July 22, 2025, plaintiff filed an amended complaint. The complaint preserved the same parties and claims as the original, but significantly expanded the factual allegations underpinning their case. Defendants' response is pending.</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "American Oversight, a nonpartisan nonprofit focused on government transparency, filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), its head Elon Musk, other DOGE officials, and the National Archives, alleging that DOGE’s use of ephemeral platforms like Signal and Google Docs to conduct official business violated the Federal Records Act (FRA) and that DOGE failed to search for and release records under FOIA. The case also brings APA claims, including against the Archivist for failing to take required action to recover unlawfully removed records. After Plaintiff amended its complain on July 22, 2025, Defendants moved on August 5, 2025 to stay this case pending resolution of DOGE's FOIA \"agency\" status in CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service; Plaintiff opposed on August 19, arguing the stay is extraordinary, indefinite, and risks ongoing loss of federal records. The stay motion is fully briefed and waiting decision.

Since January 20, 2025, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency \nhas operated at breakneck speed to overhaul and diminish the Executive Branch of the federal \ngovernment, all while operating largely in secrecy. \n2.  The new agency, commonly referred to as DOGE, has spread its influence and \nembedded staff across the executive branch, dismantling entire agencies, canceling previously \napproved grants and contracts, overruling instructions from Senate-confirmed Cabinet members, \ndirecting the termination of tens of thousands of federal employees, and more. \n3.  Despite, or perhaps because of, DOGE’s unprecedented scope and scale, the agency  \nhas obfuscated even the most basic information about its internal operations, up to and including \nthe identity of the person in charge of its efforts. \n4.  This obfuscation features prominently in DOGE’s repeated, systemic failures to \npreserve and produce records pursuant to the Federal Records Act (“FRA”) and Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”).  DOGE uses nongovernmental, ephemeral messaging and document \nsystems like Signal and Google Docs, which lack the safeguards necessary to ensure that public \nrecords are not being wrongfully destroyed.  \n5.  This action is necessary to redress Defendants’ failures to meet their obligations \nunder the FRA and FOIA. Specifically, DOGE’s use of Signal and Google Docs to conduct official \ngovernment business violates its record-keeping obligations because DOGE has not established \nmechanisms  that  ensure  federal  records  created  on  these  platforms  are  fully  preserved  on \ngovernment  recordkeeping  systems.  Signal  is  frequently  used  for  its  ephemeral  messaging \n   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 4 of 57\ncapabilities,  and  Google  Docs  automatically  deletes  chats  conducted  through  its  internal \nmessaging system and may not preserve all circulated drafts of a document.  \n6.  Plaintiff American Oversight brings this action under the Federal Records Act \n(“FRA”), 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 \net seq., to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill \ntheir legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized use of \nSignal and Google Docs, and under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (“FOIA”), \nand the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, seeking declaratory and injunctive \nrelief to compel compliance with the requirements of FOIA in connection with FOIA requests for \nkey records regarding Defendants’ activities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has personal and subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under federal law, specifically the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n701, et seq., the FRA, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301, et seq., FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n8.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(e)  and  5  U.S.C.  § \n552(a)(4)(B). \nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff American Oversight is a nonpartisan, non-profit corporation organized \nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and incorporated under the laws of the \nDistrict of Columbia. It is committed to promoting transparency in government, educating the \npublic about government activities, and ensuring the accountability of government officials. \nThrough research and FOIA requests, American Oversight uses the information it gathers, and its \n2  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 5 of 57\nanalysis of that information, to educate the public about the activities and operations of the federal \ngovernment through reports, published analyses, press releases and other media.  \n10.  In the regular course of its work and in furtherance of its core mission and function, \nAmerican  Oversight  has  submitted  FOIA  requests  to  the  Defendants  the  Department  of \nGovernment Efficiency, U.S. DOGE Service, and U.S. DOGE Temporary Service Organization \n(collectively, “DOGE Defendants” or “DOGE”), and will continue to seek records from the DOGE \nDefendants in the future.1 \n11.  In the regular course of its work and in furtherance of its core mission and function, \nAmerican Oversight has sent more than two dozen FOIA requests to DOGE. In the regular course \nof its work and in furtherance of its core mission and function, American Oversight intends to \ncontinue to send FOIA requests to DOGE and make available to the public any records it receives \nin response. \n12.  Defendant U.S. Department of Government Efficiency is a department of the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the \nfederal government within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n551(1),  and  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §§  551(1),  552(f)(1).  See  Establishing  and  Implementing  the \nPresident’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” Exec. Order No. 14,158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 \n(Jan. 20, 2025), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02005.pdf. \n13.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service (“USDS”) is an establishment in the executive \nbranch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the federal \n \n1 For purposes of this suit, American Oversight uses the acronym “DOGE” to refer collectively to \nDefendants Department of Government Efficiency, U.S. DOGE Service, and U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization because it is the acronym used publicly by Elon Musk, President Trump, \nand other White House officials when referring to actions taken by USDS and/or agency heads \noperating on directives from Musk and other DOGE officials. \n3  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 6 of 57\ngovernment within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 552(f)(1).  See id. \n14.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is an establishment in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the \nfederal government within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n551(1), and FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 552(f)(1).  See id. \n15.  Defendant Elon Musk is one of the functional heads of DOGE, and is sued in his \nofficial capacity. \n16.  In that capacity, he is the agency head of the U.S. Department of Government \nEfficiency, USDS, and U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n17.  Defendant Steven (“Steve”) Davis is one of the functional heads of DOGE, and is \nsued in his official capacity. \n18.  In that capacity, he is the agency head of the U.S. Department of Government \nEfficiency, USDS, and U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n19.  Defendant Amy Gleason is the Acting Administrator of USDS, and is sued in her \nofficial capacity. \n20.  In that capacity, she is the agency head of the USDS and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n4  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 7 of 57\n21.  Defendant Marco Rubio is the Acting Archivist of the United States, and is sued in \nhis official capacity.  As Acting Archivist of the United States, Defendant Rubio is obligated to \nperform certain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. § 3106.  \n22.  Defendant National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”) is a federal \nagency within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), \n552(f)(1), and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.  \n23.  As further demonstrated below, because Defendants Department of Government \nEfficiency,  USDS,  and  U.S.  DOGE  Service Temporary  Organization  each  have  duties  and \nauthority that go beyond simply advising the President, they are all subject to FOIA and the FRA. \n24.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Department of Government Efficiency has \npossession, custody, and control of records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests.  \n25.  Upon information and belief, Defendant USDS has possession, custody, and control \nof records responsive to American Oversight’s requests.  \n26.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  U.S.  DOGE  Service  Temporary \nOrganization has possession, custody, and control of records responsive to American Oversight’s \nrequests.  \nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n \nFederal Records Act \n \n27.  The FRA governs the creation, management, and disposal of “records” by federal \nagencies. See generally 44 U.S.C. § 3301, et seq; see also 44 U.S.C. Chs., 21, 29, and 31.. \n28.  The FRA defines “records” to include: \nall recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics, made or received by \na Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public \nbusiness  and  preserved  or  appropriate  for  preservation  by  that  agency  or  its \nlegitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, \n5  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 8 of 57\nprocedures, operations, or other activities of the United States Government or \nbecause of the informational value of data in them[.] \n \n44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A).   \n \n29.  The  FRA  further  specifies  that  “the  term  ‘recorded  information’  includes  all \ntraditional forms of records, regardless of physical form or characteristics, including information \ncreated, manipulated, communicated, or stored in digital or electronic form.”  Id. § 3301(a)(2). \n30.  The  FRA  provides  that  the Archivist’s  determination  about  whether  recorded \ninformation is a federal record is “binding on all Federal agencies,” id. § 3301(b), and NARA’s \nregulations provide that: “[w]orking files, such as preliminary drafts and rough notes, and other \nsimilar  materials,  are  records  that  must  be  maintained  to  ensure  adequate  and  proper \ndocumentation if”: \n(1) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, \nfor official purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation, \nfollow-up, or to communicate with agency staff about agency business; and \n(2) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments \nthat adds to a proper understanding of the agency’s formulation and execution \nof basic policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities. \n \n36 C.F.R. § 1222.12(c). \n31.  As applied to the operations of DOGE, the FRA imposes duties on the heads of the \nagency and the Archivist of the United States.  \n32.  To comply with the statute, the agency head “shall make and preserve records \ncontaining adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, \nprocedures, and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the information \nnecessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of persons directly \naffected by the agency’s activities.”  44 U.S.C. § 3101. \n6  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 9 of 57\n33.  An agency head is further required to establish a records management program \nproviding “effective controls over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. \n§ 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records the head of [the] \nagency determines to be necessary and required by regulations of the Archivist,” id. § 3105.  \n34.  Under the FRA, “[a]n officer or employee of an executive agency may not create \nor send a record using a non-official electronic messaging account unless such officer or employee \n(1) copies an official electronic messaging account of the officer or employee in the original \ncreation or transmission of the record; or (2) forwards a complete copy of the record to an official \nelectronic messaging account of the officer or employee not later than 20 days after the original \ncreation or transmission of the record.” Id. § 2911(a). \n35.  When records are handled in a manner that contravenes the FRA or a parallel \nagency record-keeping policy, the FRA obligates the agency head to “notify the Archivist of any \nactual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, corruption, deletion, \nerasure, or other destruction of records in the custody of the agency . . . .” 44 U.S.C. § 3106(a). \n36.  The FRA further dictates that the agency head, with the assistance of the Archivist, \n“shall initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of records” that the agency \nhead “knows or has reason to believe have been unlawfully removed from [the] agency . . . .” Id.  \n37.  If the agency head fails to initiate an action for recovery of unlawfully removed \nrecords “or other redress within a reasonable period of time after being notified of any such \nunlawful action, or is participating in, or believed to be participating in any such unlawful action,” \nthe FRA dictates that “the Archivist shall request the Attorney General to initiate such an action, \nand shall notify Congress when such a request has been made.” Id. § 3106(b). \n7  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 10 of 57\n38.  The obligations to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General to \nrecover  unlawfully  removed  records  or  for  other  redress  are  mandatory,  not  subject  to  the \ndiscretion of the agency head nor the Archivist. See Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282, 295–96 \n(D.C. Cir. 1991). \n39.  Where both the agency head and the Archivist have “failed to initiate remedial \naction in a timely manner, private litigants may sue under the APA to require them to do so.” \nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 527 F. Supp. 2d 101, \n110 (D.D.C. 2007) (internal quotation omitted). \n40.  Thus,  “the APA  authorizes  judicial  review  of  a  claim—properly  pleaded,  of \ncourse—that the [agency’s] recordkeeping policies are arbitrary and capricious and do not comport \nwith the requirements of the FRA.” Id. at 111. \n41.  “The APA also authorizes the Court to entertain a claim that the head of the [agency] \nor the Archivist have breached their statutory obligations to take enforcement action to prevent an \nagency official from improperly destroying records or to recover records unlawfully removed from \nthe agency.” Id. \nFreedom of Information Act \n42.  Under FOIA, any document is an agency record subject to FOIA if it was “create[d] \nor obtaine[d]” by the agency and the agency is “in control of the requested materials at the time \nthe FOIA request is made.” U.S. Dep’t of Just. v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 144-45 (1989). \n43.  FOIA requires all federal agencies to make agency records available to the public \nunless one of its specified exemptions applies. See id. at 150-51; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). \n8  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 11 of 57\n44.  Within 20 working days of receiving a FOIA request, agencies are required to tell \nthe requestor the scope of records that will be produced or withheld, and the reasons for such \nwithholdings.  See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n45.  Agencies are further required to make such records “promptly available to any \nperson” who reasonably describes the records they seek.  Id. § 552(a)(3)(A). \n46.  An agency may not “destroy[] a document after it has been requested under FOIA.” \nChambers v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1004 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \nPresidential Records Act \n47.  Protections under the Presidential Records Act (“PRA”) are limited to documents \n“created or received by the President, the President’s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the \nExecutive Office of the President whose function is to advise and assist the President, in the course \nof conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, \nstatutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.” 44 U.S.C. § 2201(2). \n48.  The PRA provides the President broad discretion over the preservation or disposal \nof presidential records. \n49.  In comparing the FRA with the PRA, the D.C. Circuit emphasized that “[w]hereas \nfederal records are subject to a strict document management regime supervised by the Archivist, . \n. . the PRA ‘accords the President virtually complete control over his records during his term of \noffice.’ . . . . Neither the Archivist nor an agency head can initiate any action through the Attorney \nGeneral to effect recovery or ensure preservation of presidential records.” Armstrong v. Exec. Off. \nof the President, Off. of Admin., 1 F.3d 1274, 1290–91 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted). \n9  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 12 of 57\n50.  Although the Archivist may “request congressional advice regarding the President’s \nintention to dispose of presidential records . . . , neither the Archivist nor the Congress has the \nauthority to veto the President's disposal decision.” Id. at 1291 (internal quotation omitted). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nDOGE’s Formation \n \n51.  In November 2024, a week after the presidential election, then President-elect \nDonald Trump announced that Elon Musk would be named the head of the newly created \nDepartment of Government Efficiency, which Trump referred to as “DOGE.”2  \n52.  The acronym appears to reference the Musk-backed cryptocurrency DOGE coin.3 \n53.  DOGE’s structure and function were initially unclear, including whether it would \nbe housed within the federal government or as an external entity.4 \n54.  During the presidential transition period, the DOGE team operated out of the \nWashington, D.C. office of Tesla, Inc.5  \n55.  Musk is Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder.6 \n \n2 Elena Moore et al., Trump Taps Musk to Lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' with \nRamaswamy, NPR (Nov. 12, 2024, 9:03 PM), https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/g-s1-\n33972/trump-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-government-efficiency-deep-state.  \n3 Id.  \n4 Moore et al., supra note 1. \n5 Eric Katz, DOGE Agency Deployments Raise Ethical and Influence Concerns, Gov’t Exec., \n(Jan. 15, 2025), https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/01/doge-agency-deployments-\nraise-ethical-and-influence-concerns/402204/.  \n6 Theo Leggett, Tesla’s Challenges Run Deeper Than ‘Toxic’ Controversy Around Elon Musk, \nBBC (Mar. 19, 2025), https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz61vwjel2zo.  \n1 0 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 13 of 57\n56.  During  the  presidential  transition  period,  Musk  and  DOGE  representatives \ncommunicated with federal agencies concerning DOGE’s plans for those agencies in the new \nadministration.7  \n57.  These communications reportedly happened via Signal in at least some instances.8 \n58.  Upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order “to implement the President’s \nDOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental \nefficiency and productivity.” Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of \nGovernment Efficiency,” Exec. Order No. 14,158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 20, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02005.pdf. \n59.  This first DOGE executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. \nDOGE Service and creates a temporary organization within it called the “U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization,” “headed by the USDS Administrator” and “dedicated to advancing the \nPresident’s 18-month DOGE agenda.” Id. Under the executive order, the U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization sunsets on July 4, 2026. See id. \n60.  The first DOGE executive order further requires each “Agency Head” to establish \na DOGE Team within each agency of the executive branch. See id.9   \n61.

See id. \n62.  Trump issued a second DOGE executive order on February 11, 2025, that directs \nAgency Heads to develop “a data-driven plan, in consultation with its DOGE Team Lead, to ensure \nnew career appointment hires are in highest-need areas,” and requires that new career appointment \nhiring decisions “be made in consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead.” See Implementing \nthe President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative, Exec. \nOrder  No.  14,210  at  §  3,  90  Fed.

Bates in this District recently noted, based on \nSupreme Court precedent, the first two DOGE executive orders, sworn statements by Agency \nofficials, and the DOGE defendants in that case, “USDS appears to do much more than advise and \nassist the President,” and its actions as an entity reflect those of an “agency” as defined under the \nFOIA, the Privacy Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Economy Act. AFL-CIO v. \nDep't of Lab., No. 25-cv-339 (JDB), 2025 WL 542825, at *3 (D.D.C. Feb. 14, 2025).10   \n64.  Trump’s third DOGE-related executive order, issued February 26, 2025, provides \nfurther evidence of DOGE’s agency status. See Implementing the President’s “Department of \nGovernment Efficiency” Cost Efficiency Initiative, Exec. Order No. 14,222, 90 Fed. Reg. 11095 \n(Feb.  26,  2025)  (available  at  https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-03/pdf/2025-\n \n10 Noting that USDS’s “strong claim” to agency status under statutory definitions was \ncontradicted by its attorneys’ insistence that it is not an agency under FOIA, the Privacy Act or \nthe APA, but is an agency under the Economy Act, Judge Bates observed that “USDS becomes, \nin defendants’ view, a Goldilocks entity: not an agency when it is burdensome but an agency \nwhen it is convenient.”  Id. \n1 2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 15 of 57\n03527.pdf).  It requires each Agency Head to work with their embedded DOGE Team Leads to: \n“build a centralized technological system” with the capability to “pause and rapidly review any \npayment for which the approving employee has not submitted a brief, written justification”; review \nexisting contracts and terminate or modify them “to promote efficiency and advance the policies \nof [the] Administration”; provide monthly reports to the USDS Administrator justifying “non-\nessential travel” expenditures; and freeze all credit cards held by agency employees for 30 days.  \nIt  also  requires  each  DOGE Team  Lead  to  report  monthly  to  the  USDS Administrator  on \n“contracting activities,” including “all payment justifications.” Id. \nLeadership of DOGE \n65.  On  information  and  belief,  the Administration  has  purposefully  obscured  the \nleadership structure of DOGE. \n66.  As described more fully below, there are at least three individuals who may be the \nfunctional head of DOGE or share responsibilities for co-leading DOGE:  Elon Musk, who has \nbeen the public face of DOGE since its announcement in November 2024; Amy Gleason, who the \nAdministration has named as the Acting Administrator of the U.S. DOGE Service; and Steve \nDavis, a longtime aide to Musk and the person reportedly running DOGE’s day-to-day operations. \n67.  Elon  Musk  was  named  as  head  of  DOGE  at  its  inception  prior  to Trump’s \ninauguration. \n68.  Musk directed DOGE’s work upon Trump’s inauguration. \n69.  On information and belief, Musk continues to direct at least some of DOGE’s work \nand is responsible for overseeing the President’s “DOGE Agenda.” \n70.  Trump, White House officials, and Musk himself have repeatedly and publicly \nemphasized Musk’s control over DOGE.   \n1 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 16 of 57\n71.  On February 5, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that \nTrump “was elected with a mandate from the American people to make this government more \nefficient.  He campaigned across this country with Elon Musk vowing that Elon was going to head \nup the Department of Government Efficiency.”11  \n72.  In the same February 5 press conference, Leavitt, when asked about Musk’s \npotential conflicts of interest, stated that “if Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the \ncontracts and the funding that DOGE is overseeing, then Elon will excuse himself from those \ncontracts.”12 \n73.  The White House told U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan on February 17, 2025, \nthat Musk is neither the DOGE Administrator nor a DOGE employee and “has no actual or formal \nauthority to make government decisions himself—including personnel decisions at individual \nagencies.”13  \n74.  However, that statement is contradicted by Musk’s public statements and other \nevidence, including that Musk directed mass “What did you do last week?” emails to federal \nemployees requiring them to respond or face termination.14  \n75.  The White House’s representation on February 17 is also contradicted by Trump’s \nown public statements.  \n \n11 White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Briefs Members of the Media, YouTube (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://www.youtube.com/live/0QJrwxIZGW8?t=1450s [24:10 – 24:21].   \n12 Id. \n13 Notice by Elon Musk et al. at 1, and Decl. of Joshua Fisher, State of New Mexico et al. v.

Just three days after the White House’s representations to Judge Chutkan, Trump \ntold an audience of investors and company executives in Miami, “I signed an order creating the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.”15 \n77.  President Trump and Press Secretary Leavitt have repeatedly talked about Musk as \nthe functional leader of DOGE. \n78.  On February 22, 2025, Trump posted on the site Truth Social, “ELON IS DOING \nA GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.”16 \n79.  Musk responded on X (formerly Twitter) by posting a screenshot of Trump’s \nmessage and adding, “Will do, Mr. President!”17 \n80.  On February 25, 2025, Leavitt reiterated Trump’s desire for Musk to be “more \naggressive,” explaining that this was “because DOGE thus far has proven incredibly successful in \nmaking our government more efficient.”18 \n81.  In the same February 25 briefing, when asked to identify the USDS Administrator, \nLeavitt stated that “the President tasked Elon Musk to oversee the DOGE effort.”19 \n \n15 Andrea Shalal and Nandita Bose, Trump Appears to Contradict White House, Says Elon Musk \nin Charge of DOGE, REUTERS (Feb. 20, 2025 12:27 PM), \nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-appears-contradict-white-house-says-elon-musk-\ncharge-doge-2025-02-20/. \n16 Rachel Wolf, Trump Says Elon Musk Should Be ‘More Aggressive’ on DOGE Cuts, Musk \nResponds, FOX BUSINESS (Feb. 22, 2025 11:32 AM), \nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-says-elon-musk-should-more-aggressive-doge-cuts.  \n17 Id.; see also Elon Musk (@elonmusk), X (formerly Twitter) (Feb. 22, 2025 11:08 AM), \nhttps://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893332118752706661.  \n18 White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Briefs Members of the Media, YouTube (Feb. \n25, 2025), https://www.youtube.com/live/Vl-_9pOiAl0?feature=shared&t=1000 [16:40-16:45].    \n19 Id. \n1 5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 18 of 57\n82.  On February 26, 2025, Musk attended and spoke at length at the first Cabinet \nmeeting of the new administration.20 \n83.  In explaining Musk’s attendance at the Cabinet meeting, Leavitt stated that “Elon \nis working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud \nand abuse at these respective agencies. All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction \nof DOGE.”21 \n84.  On March 4, 2025, President Trump in an address to Congress confirmed that Musk \nleads DOGE, stating “. . . I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency . . . \n[w]hich is headed by Elon Musk, who is in the gallery tonight.”22 \n85.  On March 5, the Washington Post reported that some Republican senators were \ngiven Musk’s phone number so they could have direct access to seek his help getting “problematic \ncuts” made by DOGE “quickly reversed.”23 \n86.

Gleason filed a sworn declaration in another action in this District on March 14, \n2025,  stating  that  she  “serve[s]  as  the Acting Administrator  of  USDS”  and  is  “full-time, \ngovernment employee at USDS,” and as such, she “oversee[s] all of USDS’s employees and \ndetailees to USDS from other agencies.”25 \n88.  In a message to a 300-person group chat obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle, \nGleason attempted to explain that she “currently serve[s] as acting administrator of the U.S. Doge \nService (formerly U.S. Digital Service),” which is separate from the Agency DOGE Teams, and is \nalso separate from “the broader Doge [sic] policy agenda that Elon Musk advises the President \non.”26 \n89.  However, a sworn declaration in a different case—which the Government initially \nsought to file under seal and is dated three days prior to Gleason’s March 14 declaration—states \nthat Gleason was detailed from USDS to the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) \nin February 2025 and then converted to a direct, presumably full-time HHS hire on March 4, \n2025.27 \n \n25 Decl. of Amy Gleason ¶¶ 2-4, Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington v.

The third candidate for leader of DOGE is Musk’s longtime aide Steve Davis, who \nthe New York Times reported has “effectively become the day-to-day leader of DOGE,” and wields \n“more power than Amy Gleason,” who has “sometimes been in the dark about Mr. Davis’s \ndecisions.”28 \n91.  Davis has, inter alia, called the leaders of the Social Security Administration \n(“SSA”) to demand that a DOGE programmer be given access to databases containing sensitive \ninformation, “slashed diversity initiatives,” met with lawmakers, and pushed Trump administration \nofficials to let him email all government employees simultaneously, leading to “a January email \nblast known as the ‘Fork in the Road,’ which included a governmentwide resignation offer.”29 \n92.  ProPublica has similarly reported that “[t]he exact chain of command at DOGE is \nnot clear to most federal employees who brush up against the team,” but that Gleason “does not \nappear to be running the budget-slashing group,” and that day-to-day operations are run by Davis \nand sometimes “Musk himself,” who “issues commands from inside the Secretary of War Suite in \nthe Eisenhower Executive Office Building.”30 \n93.  In  a  30(b)(6)  deposition  of  DOGE,  its  representative  admitted  that  between \nFebruary 5 and February 18, “there was not a formal acting administrator,” but that “at the time, \nSteve Davis was the senior-most political advisor,” so Davis made decisions that “Gleason later \n \ndf (denying government’s motion to seal the SF-61s or redact from the SF-61s the affiants’ \nnames). \n28 Ryan Mac et al., Meet Elon Musk’s Top Lieutenant Who Oversees DOGE, N.Y.

Thus,  the  leadership  structure  of  DOGE—like  much  about  its  operations—\ncontinues to be shrouded in mystery. \nDOGE Wields Substantial Independent Authority Across the Executive Branch \n95.   As alleged more fully below, DOGE’s authority extends across the executive \nbranch. \n96.  Musk and DOGE enjoy substantial free rein to implement the “DOGE agenda” as \nthey see fit, issuing commands to entities and persons within the executive branch—commands \nthat agency officials and Cabinet secretaries treat as legally authoritative. \n97.  DOGE exercises this authority independent of the President and senior White \nHouse officials, who often are unaware of DOGE’s actions until they are made public.32 \n98.  For instance, even after the White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles instructed Musk \nto keep her informed of his plans, Musk used Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”) systems \n \n31 Dep.

The message instructed federal employees to send an email documenting their \naccomplishments for the previous week and said that any nonresponse would be considered a \nresignation.34 \n100.  In just the first three weeks of the new administration, DOGE staffers reportedly \naccessed the offices of at least 15 executive branch agencies.35  \n101.  They have since accessed the offices and/or computer systems of many more \nagencies.  \n102.  With respect to these agencies, DOGE staff have reportedly (a) gained access to \ncomputer systems previously available only to agency employees, (b) rendered decisions related \nto agency payments or agency personnel, and (c) ordered agency supervisors or staff to take \nvarious actions. \n103.

DOGE personnel reportedly halted certain agency payments, overruling Secretary \nof State Marco Rubio, who has also been serving as the Acting USAID Administrator.  \n106.  On January 28, Rubio issued an “Emergency Humanitarian Waiver to Foreign \nAssistance  Pause,”  to  allow  continued  payments  for  “life-saving  humanitarian  assistance \nprograms.”38  \n107.  But despite Rubio’s—as well as USAID managers’ and the White House’s—\nexpress authorization for these payments, DOGE personnel reportedly blocked the payments. 39  \n108.

DOGE staff reportedly planned to eliminate or significantly reduce telephone \nservice and identity verification for Social Security recipients, which could cause processing \ndelays and prevent many Americans from receiving benefits.56 \n128.  DOGE staff have gained access to data systems containing highly sensitive data at \nmany more agencies.  For example, DOGE staff are now alleged to have access to the Department \nof Health and Human Services’ Unaccompanied Alien Children portal, which includes detailed \ninformation about minor children who enter the United States without a parent or guardian, and \nwhich contains mental health and therapy records, reports of trauma such as physical or sexual \nabuse, immigration records, photos, and addresses of family members.57 \n129.  DOGE staff have also accessed sensitive systems at the Department of Labor.58 \n130.

Individual DOGE staffers have access to data systems at multiple agencies and are \ndetailed to or on staff at multiple agencies simultaneously or sequentially. \n136.

Signal is an open-source, encrypted messaging service that allows users to send \ntext, audio, video, and picture messages to other users. \n153.  Signal includes a function that allows users to set time limits by which their sent \nmessages will disappear and be deleted from both the sender’s and recipient’s devices.75 \n154.

Work product created by DOGE staffers on Google Docs and all drafts thereof are \nfederal records that must be preserved under the FRA.  The FRA requires working drafts to be \nindividually preserved where they were “circulated or made available to employees, other than the \ncreator” for “approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to communicate with \nagency  staff  about  agency  business,”  and  “contain  unique  information,  such  as  substantive \nannotations or comments.” 36 C.F.R. § 1222.12(c). \n167.  The nature of Google Docs, and the fact that multiple DOGE staffers work in a \nsingle document simultaneously, means that draft documents are necessarily circulated or made \navailable to employees. \n168.  Furthermore, on information and belief, many draft Google Docs contain unique \ninformation, such as substantive annotations or comments. \n169.  Other uses of Google Docs include using a single shared document as a shared \nmessage pad—like a physical whiteboard on which people write notes to one another, erasing \nprevious notes along the way—as an alternative to email. \n170.  However, only certain paid Google suites have the ability to show who edited which \npart of a document.82 \n \n81 See Ulmer et al., supra note 79.  \n82 Google Docs Editors Help, Find what’s changed in a file, \nhttps://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 (stating that seeing “who changed a part of a \ndocument in Google Docs” is “available to only Google Workspace Business Standard, Business \nPlus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, and Education Plus customers”) (last visited Apr. 16, \n2025). \n3 2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 35 of 57\n171.  Moreover, Google Docs does not necessarily save all prior versions of a document, \nbut may instead “merge [previous versions] to save storage space.”83 \n172.  On information and belief, DOGE has not established systems within its version of \nGoogle Docs to ensure that all federal records are captured and preserved. \n173.  Accordingly, DOGE’s use of Google Docs runs a substantial risk that federal \nrecords have been wrongfully disposed of already, because prior drafts have likely been lost, along \nwith records showing which staffers contributed which sections to drafts of documents and \ncommentary included in comment bubbles or other annotations. \n174.  For the same reasons, DOGE’s use of Google Docs also threatens the imminent \nwrongful destruction of additional federal records. \n175.  Google  Docs  threatens  the  imminent  and  wrongful  destruction  for  a  second, \nindependent reason. \n176.  Google Docs contains an internal chat feature.  This allows all users working \nsimultaneously on a document to chat directly within the document itself.84 \n177.  However, Google clearly states both in its instructions and directly within these \nchats themselves (sample screenshot below) that they are not saved:85 \n \n \n83 Id. \n84 Google Docs Editors Help, Chat with others in a file, \nhttps://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494891.  \n85 Id. \n3 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 36 of 57\n178.  On information and belief, DOGE is using Google Docs internal chats. \n179.  On information and belief, DOGE has not established systems within its instance \nof Google Docs to preserve Google Docs internal chats in federal record-keeping systems. \n180.  Google Docs internal chats are “recorded information . . . made or received by \n[DOGE] in connection with the transaction of public business.”  See 44 U.S.C. § 3301. \n181.  Chats within a Google Doc are federal records that must be preserved. \n182.  Because  Google  Docs  chats  are  not  being  preserved  on  official  government \nrecordkeeping systems, any use by DOGE of the Google Docs chat feature is a violation of the \nFRA. \nDOGE’s Records Retention Policy \n183.  In a separate FOIA action brought by American Oversight in this District against \nDOGE, DOGE produced a Records Retention Policy.  See United States DOGE Service Records \nRetention Policy, Am. Oversight v. Dept. of Govt. Efficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Mar. \n27, 2025), ECF No. 13-2. \n184.  The Records Retention Policy is dated March 25, 2025.   \n185.  March 25 is one day after American Oversight filed a Motion for a Preservation \nOrder that asked the court to order DOGE to preserve all records responsive to the FOIA requests \nat issue in that lawsuit.  Pl.’s Mot. for Preservation Order, Am. Oversight v. Dept. of Govt. \nEfficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025), ECF No. 12. \n186.  The Records Retention Policy purports to be in accord with the PRA, not the FRA \nor FOIA. \n187.  The Records Retention Policy advises, but does not require, that DOGE employees, \n“disabl[e] auto-delete features” on messaging services like Signal. \n3 4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 37 of 57\nAmerican Oversight Puts DOGE and NARA on Notice of FRA Violations \n188.  On January 22, 2025, American Oversight sent a letter to Elon Musk in his capacity \nas DOGE’s apparent leader, reminding him of the agency’s obligations to preserve federal records \npursuant to the FRA.86 That same day, American Oversight sent similar letters to the Departments \nof Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Treasury, Veterans Affairs, OMB, \nand NARA, warning them of the consequences of potential destruction or removal of DOGE \ncommunications.87 \n189.  To date, American Oversight has received no response from Musk or anyone else \nassociated with DOGE to the letter sent January 22. \n190.  American Oversight received a response to one of the January 22 letters from \nWilliam Fischer, Chief Records Officer of NARA.  This letter stated only that “[t]he issues raised \nin your letter are now before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, \nsee  CREW  v.  U.S.  DOGE  Service,  1:25-cv-00511.

In early March 2025, a DOGE team accessed confidential data on the computer \nsystems of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”).88 \n192.  Based on these events, a whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, a technical expert at the \nNLRB, submitted an official disclosure to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel.89  \n193.  Reportedly, the DOGE team demanded the highest level of access to NLRB \ncomputer systems—“tenant owner level” accounts “with essentially unrestricted permission to \nread, copy and alter data.” But the DOGE team rebuffed NLRB staff’s offer to grant such access \nin a manner that would log DOGE activity consistent with the NLRB’s cybersecurity policies.90 \n194.  DOGE programmer Jordan Wick wrote code to access NLRB’s internal case \nmanagement system, NxGen.91 \n195.  Reportedly, DOGE programmers insisted that their activities not be logged.92  \n196.  Reportedly, while DOGE programmers were accessing the NLRB’s systems, an \nunusually large amount of data exited the NLRB’s network. NLRB technical staff were sufficiently \nconcerned that they launched a formal breach investigation and sought assistance from CISA.93 \n197.  Reportedly,  DOGE  programmers  deleted  access  logs,  records  of  the  data \nexfiltration, and other records of their activities from the NLRB’s computer systems.94  \n \n88 See Jenna McLaughlin, A Whistleblower’s Disclosure Details How DOGE May Have Taken \nSensitive Labor Data, NPR (Apr. 15, 2025, 5:00 AM), https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-\n5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security.  \n89 Id. \n90 Id. \n91 Id. \n92 Id. \n93 Id. \n94 Id. \n3 6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 39 of 57\n198.

American Oversight has submitted 30 FOIA requests to DOGE since January 20, \n2025. \n200.  American Oversight will continue to submit FOIA requests to DOGE. \n201.  American Oversight has already filed one previous lawsuit against DOGE seeking \nto compel DOGE to produce records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests.  Am. \nOversight v. Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025).  \n202.  DOGE’s use  of  Google  Docs  means  that  records  responsive  to  a  number  of \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests have already or may imminently be disposed of unlawfully. \n203.  Likewise, DOGE’s use of Signal and Mattermost separately mean that records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests have already or may imminently be disposed \nof unlawfully. \nAgency Dismantling FOIA Request \n204.

On  March  7,  2025,  American  Oversight  submitted  a  FOIA  request  to \nUSDS@omb.eop.gov,  bearing  internal  tracking  number  USDS-25-0607  (“Gleason \nCommunications Request”), seeking the following records from January 20, 2025 through the date \nthe search is conducted: \n1.  All  records  reflecting  communications  (including  emails,  email \nattachments, text messages, messages on messaging platforms (such as \nSignal,  Slack,  GChat  or  Google  Hangouts,  Lync,  Skype,  X  (formerly \nTwitter) direct messages, Facebook messages, WhatsApp, Telegram, or \nParler), telephone call logs, calendar invitations, calendar entries, meeting \nnotices, meeting agendas, informational material, draft legislation, talking \npoints,  any  handwritten  or  electronic  notes  taken  during  any  oral \ncommunications,  summaries  of  any  oral  communications,  or  other \nmaterials) received by Amy Gleason notifying her of her appointment to \nserve as the Acting Administrator of USDS. \n \n2.  All calendars or calendar entries for Amy Gleason, including any calendars \nmaintained on her behalf, from January 20, 2025, through the date the \nsearch is conducted. \n \nAmerican Oversight requests that the calendars be produced in a format that \nincludes all invitees, any notes, and all attachments. \n \nPlease do not limit your search to electronic calendars; we request the \nproduction of any calendar — paper or electronic, whether on government- \nissued or personal devices — used to track or coordinate how Gleason \nallocates her time on agency business. \n \nThis search should include any calendars associated with Gleason’s email \naccounts, as well as any official calendars maintained for him, including by \nan aide, assistant, or scheduler. \n \n3.  All  text  messages  (including  complete  text  message  threads  or \nconversations) or messages on messaging platforms (such as Signal, Slack, \nGChat  or  Google  Hangouts,  Lync,  Skype,  X  (formerly Twitter)  direct \nmessages, Facebook messages, WhatsApp, Telegram, or Parler) sent or \nreceived by Amy Gleason. \n3 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 43 of 57\n \n4.  All email communications (including emails, email attachments, complete \nemail chains, calendar invitations, and calendar invitation attachments) sent \nby Amy Gleason — and/or anyone communicating on her behalf, including \na chief of staff, assistant, and/or secretary — to any email address ending in \n.com, .co, .us, .net, .org, .mail, .edu, .law, .ch, and/or .me. \n \nIn  an  effort  to  accommodate  your  office  and  reduce  the  number  of \npotentially responsive records to be processed and produced, American \nOversight has limited part four of this request to emails sent by Amy \nGleason — and/or anyone communicating on her behalf, including a chief \nof  staff,  assistant,  and/or  secretary.  To  be  clear,  however,  American \nOversight still requests that complete email chains be produced, displaying \nboth  sent  and  received  messages. This  means,  for  example,  that  both \nGleason’s response to an email from an email address ending in .com and \nthe initial received message are responsive to this request and should be \nproduced.   \n \n5.  All  records  reflecting  guidance  —  including  directives,  instructions, \ndirections, memoranda, and/or any other written guidance — issued by Amy \nGleason in her role as Acting Administrator of USDS. \n \nSee Exhibit 3. \n \n208.  DOGE has not acknowledged receipt of this request nor otherwise communicated \nabout this request with American Oversight. \n209.

Prior versions and drafts of any guidance documents referenced in Part 5 of the \nGleason Communications Request are responsive to this request. \nOversight Guidance Request  \n211.  On  March  11,  2025,  American  Oversight  sent  a  FOIA  request  to \nUSDS@omb.eop.gov, bearing internal tracking number USDS-25-0610 (“Oversight Guidance \nRequest”), seeking the following records from January 20, 2025, through the date the search is \nconducted: \n4 0 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 44 of 57\nAll records reflecting guidance — including directives, instructions, directions, \nmemoranda,  informal  email guidance,  and/or  any  other  informal \nwritten guidance —  created  and/or  issued  by  U.S.  DOGE  Service  regarding \noversight of the executive branch – including congressional oversight (both specific \ncongressional oversight of specific matters and general policies, concerns, and \nconsiderations related to congressional oversight of the executive branch), requests \nfrom agency’s Inspectors General, requests from the Governmental Accountability \nOffice (GAO), and/or FOIA requests. \n \nSee Exhibit 4. \n \n212.  DOGE has not acknowledged receipt of this request nor otherwise communicated \nabout this request with American Oversight. \nProbationary Employee Firing Request \n213.

This \nmeans, for example, that both a listed official’s response to an email \ncontaining any of the key terms listed above and the initial received message \nare responsive to this request and should be produced.  \n \n3.

DOGE has not acknowledged receipt of this request nor otherwise communicated \nabout this request with American Oversight. \nDOGE’s Use of Signal, Mattermost, and Google Docs Violates FOIA and the FRA \n \n215.  Defendants’ use of Signal suggests that they have used Signal to communicate \nabout matters that may otherwise have been discussed via email, thereby avoiding creating records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests for emails.  \n216.  Defendants’  use  of  Mattermost  suggests  that  they  have  used  Mattermost  to \ncommunicate about matters that may otherwise have been discussed via email, thereby avoiding \ncreating records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests for emails. \n217.  Defendants’ use of Google Docs suggests that they have used Google Docs to \ncommunicate about matters that may otherwise have been discussed via email, thereby avoiding \ncreating records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests for emails. \n218.  Defendants’ use of Google Docs suggests that they have used Google Docs to avoid \ncreating and separately preserving individual drafts of documents with commentary and that reflect \nwhich  individuals  created  which  sections,  thereby  avoiding  creating  records  responsive  to \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n219.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  Musk,  Davies,  and  Gleason  (the \n“Individual Defendants”), in their capacities as heads of DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve \nmessages sent or received in Signal chats or to recover any that have been lost or deleted.  \n4 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 47 of 57\n220.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve messages sent or received in Mattermost chats or to \nrecover any that have been lost or deleted. \n221.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve messages sent or received in Google Docs chats or to \nrecover any that have been lost or deleted. \n222.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve all prior drafts of federal records produced in Google \nDocs with their commentary and reflecting which individuals contributed which sections to \ndocuments, nor taken steps to recover any prior drafts that have been lost or deleted. \n223.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve records in other electronic communication systems that \npermit ephemeral messaging or can be configured or used not to preserve records. \nExhaustion of Administrative Remedies \n \n224.  As of the date of this Complaint, Defendants have failed to: (a) notify American \nOversight of a final determination regarding any of the requests at issue here, including the scope \nof  responsive  records  Defendants  intend  to  produce  or  withhold  and  the  reasons  for  any \nwithholdings; or (b) produce the requested records or demonstrate that the requested records are \nlawfully exempt from production. \n225.  More than 20 working days have passed since all FOIA requests at issue in this \nlawsuit were filed. \n4 4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 48 of 57\n226.  Through Defendants’ failures to respond to American Oversight’s FOIA requests \nwithin the time period required by law, American Oversight has constructively exhausted its \nadministrative remedies and seeks immediate judicial review. \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCount I – as to Defendants Musk, Davies, and Gleason  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \n \n227.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n228.  Messages in Signal chats, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral \nmessaging systems responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded \ninformation . . . made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the \ntransaction of public business,” are federal records under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and \nmust be preserved and safeguarded against removal or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1), 2911, and § 3105. \nFederal records may only be alienated or destroyed through the careful process set forth in the \nFRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting forth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n229.  Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably should know \nthat the communications in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral messaging \nsystem chats constitute “records” under the FRA. \n230.  Defendants have failed and continue to fail to implement measures to prevent the \nautomatic deletion of messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral \nmessaging system chats, which violates their obligations under the FRA. \n231.  By permitting and engaging in the use of Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats \nor other ephemeral messaging systems to communicate regarding agency business, Defendants \n4 5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 49 of 57\nhave failed to establish a records management program providing “effective control[] over the \ncreation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. § 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards \nagainst the removal or loss of records,” id. § 3105. \n232.  The recordkeeping practices Defendants have in place at DOGE are inadequate, \narbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with the FRA.  \n233.  Defendants’ failure to properly preserve federal records amounts to removal of \nagency records from the agency itself and violates the FRA. \n234.  Upon information and belief, messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats \nor other ephemeral messaging system chats have not and are not being maintained in accordance \nwith the FRA.  \n235.  Upon information and belief, messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, \nor other ephemeral messaging system chats responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests are \nbeing or will imminently be destroyed in contravention of the FRA.  \n236.  Each Defendant is on notice of the unlawful removal or destruction of agency \nrecords, at minimum because of their receipt of the January 22, 2025, letter from American \nOversight Chief Counsel Ron Fein.  See supra ¶ 188.  \n237.  Where, as here, this violation is known to Defendants, each Defendant, in their \nrespective capacities as agency heads, has a nondiscretionary duty under the FRA to report the \nviolation to the Acting Archivist and to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General \nso that the alienated records can be recovered.  \n238.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to preserve and \nrecover the unlawfully removed records.   \n4 6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 50 of 57\n239.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to notify the \nArchivist of the above-described known FRA violations.  \n240.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to initiate an action \nthrough the Attorney General to preserve and recover the unlawfully removed records or for other \nredress.  \n241.  Defendants’  failures  and  violations  have  injured  American  Oversight  by \ncompromising federal records that may be responsive to American Oversight’s pending and future \nFOIA requests, thereby increasing the likelihood that American Oversight will be unable to obtain \nresponsive federal records now and in the future. \n242.  Defendants’ failure to act constitutes a final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court of law. Moreover, it is an agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed, and is also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not \nin accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nCount II – as to Defendants Musk, Davies, and Gleason \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \n \n243.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n244.  Prior versions of documents created in Google Docs responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded information . . . made or received by a Federal \nagency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business,” are federal \nrecords under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and must be preserved and safeguarded against \nremoval or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1) and § 3105. Federal records may only be alienated or \n4 7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 51 of 57\ndestroyed through the careful process set forth in the FRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting \nforth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n245.  Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably should know \nthat prior versions of documents created in Google Docs constitute “records” under the FRA. \n246.  Defendants have failed and continue to fail to implement measures to prevent the \ndeletion or conflation of prior versions of Google Docs. This violates their obligations under the \nFRA. \n247.  Defendants have failed and continue to fail to implement measures to prevent the \nuse of Google Docs as a shared transient message pad. This violates their obligations under the \nFRA. \n248.  By permitting and engaging in the use of Google Docs to create records in the \ncourse of agency business, Defendants have failed to establish a records management program \nproviding “effective control over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. \n§ 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,” id. § 3105. \n249.  The recordkeeping practices Defendants have in place at DOGE are inadequate, \narbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with the FRA.  \n250.  Defendants’ failure to properly preserve federal records amounts to removal of \nagency records from the agency itself and violates the FRA. \n251.  Upon  information  and  belief,  documents  and  drafts  created  in  Google  Docs \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests are being or will imminently be destroyed in \ncontravention of the FRA.  \n4 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 52 of 57\n252.  Each Defendant is on notice of the unlawful removal or destruction of agency \nrecords, at minimum because of their receipt of the January 22, 2025, letter from American \nOversight Chief Counsel Ron Fein.  See supra ¶ 188. \n253.  Where, as here, this violation is known to Defendants, each Defendant, in their \ncapacity as an agency head, has a nondiscretionary duty under the FRA to report the violation to \nthe Acting Archivist and to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General so that the \nalienated records can be recovered.  \n254.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to preserve and \nrecover the unlawfully removed records.   \n255.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to notify the \nArchivist of the above-described known FRA violations.  \n256.  Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to initiate an action \nthrough the Attorney General to preserve and recover the unlawfully removed records or for other \nredress.  \n257.  Defendants’  failures  and  violations  have  injured  American  Oversight  by \ncompromising federal records that may be responsive to American Oversight’s pending and future \nFOIA requests, thereby increasing the likelihood that American Oversight will be unable to obtain \nresponsive federal records now and in the future. \n258.  Defendants’ failure to act constitutes a final agency action for which there is no \nother adequate remedy in a court of law. Moreover, it is an agency action unlawfully withheld or \nunreasonably delayed, and is also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not \nin accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \n4 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 53 of 57\nCount III – as to Defendants NARA and Acting Archivist Rubio \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \n \n259.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n260.  Defendants  NARA  and  Rubio,  in  his  capacity  as Acting Archivist,  have  an \nindependent nondiscretionary duty under the FRA to initiate a recovery action or action for other \nredress through the Attorney General when the agency head fails to do so.  \n261.  Defendants NARA and Rubio have been made aware of the unlawfully alienated \nagency records because of their receipt of the January 22, 2025, letter from American Oversight \nChief Counsel Ron Fein, which was acknowledged by NARA on March 27, 2025. See supra ¶ \n190; Ex. 1. \n262.  Defendants NARA and Rubio have also been made aware of the unlawfully \nalienated agency records because of the widespread public reporting of this alienation. \n263.  Defendant Rubio, as Acting Archivist, knows or reasonably should know that \nDefendants Musk, Davies, and Gleason failed to take appropriate action to preserve and recover \nrecords from the Signal chat.  \n264.  However, Defendant Rubio has also failed to act consistent with his independent \nobligation as Acting Archivist to initiate an action for recovery or other redress. Accordingly, \nDefendants NARA and Rubio are in default of their nondiscretionary obligations under the FRA.  \n265.  This failure to act is a final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court of law. Moreover, it is an agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed, and is also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance \nwith law. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \n5 0 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 54 of 57\nCount IV – as to the DOGE Defendants \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nFailure to Conduct Adequate Searches for Responsive Records \n \n266.  American  Oversight  repeats  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  and \nincorporates them as though fully set forth herein.   \n267.  American Oversight properly requested records within Defendants’ possession, \ncustody, and control. \n268.  Defendant Department of Government Efficiency has failed to promptly review \nagency  records  for  the  purpose  of  locating  those  records  that  are  responsive  to American \nOversight’s FOIA Requests.  \n269.  Defendant USDS has failed to promptly review agency records for the purpose of \nlocating those records that are responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA Requests. \n270.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization has failed to promptly \nreview agency records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA Requests. \n271.  Each Defendant’s failure to conduct an adequate search for responsive records \nviolates FOIA and applicable regulations.  \n272.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to injunctive and declaratory \nrelief requiring Defendants to promptly search for and produce records responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA Requests. \nCount V – as to the DOGE Defendants \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nWrongful Withholding of Non-Exempt Responsive Records \n \n273.  American  Oversight  repeats  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  and \nincorporates them as though fully set forth herein. \n5 1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 55 of 57\n274.  American Oversight properly requested records within Defendants’ possession, \ncustody, and control. \n275.  Defendant Department of Government Efficiency is subject to FOIA and must \ntherefore release in response to a FOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful \nreason for withholding any materials within no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of \neach of American Oversight’s requests.  \n276.  Defendant USDS is subject to FOIA and must therefore release in response to a \nFOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful reason for withholding any materials \nwithin no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of each of American Oversight’s requests.  \n277.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is subject to FOIA and \nmust therefore release in response to a FOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful \nreason for withholding any materials within no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of \neach of American Oversight’s requests.  \n278.  Defendants are wrongfully withholding non-exempt agency records requested by \nAmerican Oversight by failing to produce non-exempt records responsive to American Oversight’s \nFOIA Requests.  \n279.  Defendants are wrongfully withholding non-exempt agency records requested by \nAmerican Oversight by failing to segregate exempt information in otherwise non-exempt records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA Requests.  \n280.  Defendants’ failure to provide all non-exempt responsive records violates FOIA and \napplicable regulations. \n281.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to declaratory and injunctive \nrelief requiring Defendants to promptly produce all non-exempt records responsive to American \n5 2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 56 of 57\nOversight’s FOIA Requests and provide indexes justifying the withholding of any responsive \nrecords withheld under claim of exemption. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n(1)  Declare that messages and communications sent through the Signal and Mattermost \napplications in the course of conducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n(2)  Declare that messages and communications sent through the Google Docs chat \nfeature in the course of conducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n(3)  Declare that prior drafts of documents created in Google Docs in the course of \nconducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n(4)  Declare that the failure to ensure such messages and communications are preserved, \nas required by 44 U.S.C. § 2911, comprises an unlawful removal of federal records in violation of \nthe FRA; \n(5)  Declare that Defendants have maintained an inadequate recordkeeping system \nunder the FRA; \n(6)  Declare that Defendants have violated their respective duties under the FRA and \nAPA; \n(7)  Order Defendants to comply with their respective duties under the FRA and APA, \nincluding by referring the matter to the Attorney General for enforcement of the FRA, preservation \nof records, recovery of unlawfully removed records, and the recovery or restoration of any deleted \nor destroyed materials to the extent possible; \n(8)  Order Defendants to preserve all materials relating to Plaintiff’s claims under the \nFRA;  \n5 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251     Document 1     Filed 04/23/25     Page 57 of 57\n(9)  Order Defendants to conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA Requests; \n(10)  Order Defendants to produce, within 20 days of the Court’s order, any and all non-\nexempt records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA Requests, and Vaughn indexes of any \nresponsive records withheld under claim of exemption; \n(11)  Enjoin Defendants from continuing to withhold any and all non-exempt records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA Requests; \n(12)  Order  Defendants  to  preserve  all  records  potentially  responsive  to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests; \n(13)  Grant Plaintiff an award of attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs reasonably \nincurred in this action; and \n(14)  Grant Plaintiff any other relief this Court deems appropriate. \n \nDated: April 23, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n    /s/ David Kronig \n   David Kronig \n  D.C.

Rubio, and National Archives and Records Administration \n(collectively, the “Defendants”), by and through undersigned counsel,  respectfully move to \ndismiss Plaintiff American Oversight’s Complaint.1 \nPlaintiff’s Complaint purports to bring challenges that fit into two buckets. First, Plaintiff \nargues that Defendants’ use of certain media violates the Federal Records Act (“FRA”), 44 U.S.C. \n§§ 3101 et seq. Second, Plaintiff brings claims under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), \n5 U.S.C. § 552, seeking to compel Defendants to respond to Plaintiff’s FOIA request. However, \nPlaintiff’s claims uniformly fail because the United States DOGE Service (“USDS”) and its \naffiliated Defendants are not “agencies” subject to FOIA or the FRA. And even if USDS were an \nagency, two of Plaintiff’s FRA claims fail to state a claim. As such, this Court should dismiss \nPlaintiffs’ Complaint with prejudice. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Federal Records Act and the Presidential Records Act \nThe Federal Records Act (“FRA) “governs the creation, management and disposal of \nfederal records.” Armstrong v. Bush (“Armstrong I”), 924 F.2d 282, 284 (D.C. Cir. 1991). To \nensure “[a]ccurate and complete documentation of the policies and transactions of the Federal \nGovernment” while “prevent[ing] the creation of unnecessary records,” 44 U.S.C. § 2902, the FRA \ndefines federal records as “all recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics, made or \n \n1   Plaintiff also purports to sue the “United States Department of Government Efficiency.” \nThere is no institution by that name. The United States Department of Government Efficiency \nrefers to a political initiative created by the President that is advanced by the United States DOGE \nService in the Executive Office of the President and agency DOGE teams selected by agency \nleadership and comprised by agency personnel. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 8 of 34\nreceived by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public \nbusiness and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor \nas evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other \nactivities of the United States Government or because of the informational value of data in them.” \nId. § 3301(a)(1)(A). Under the FRA, agencies must “make and preserve records containing \nadequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, \nand essential transactions of the agency.” Id. § 3101. It also requires that agencies “establish \nsafeguards against the removal or loss of records.” Id. § 3105.  \nThe  Presidential  Records  Act  (“PRA”)  imposes  recordkeeping  requirements  on  the \nPresident and Vice President rather than on agencies. Id. § 2201(2)(B)(i). The PRA defines \npresidential records as “documentary materials . . . created or received by the President, the \nPresident’s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the Executive Office of the President whose \nfunction is to advise or assist the President, in the course of conducting activities which relate to \nor have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, statutory, or other official or \nceremonial duties of the President.” Id. § 2201(2). It excludes records that are of “purely private \nor nonpublic character which do not relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the \nconstitutional,  statutory,  or  other  official  or  ceremonial  duties  of  the  President.”  Id. \n§ 2201(2)(B)(ii), (3). The PRA requires the President to “take all such steps as may be necessary \nto assure that the activities, deliberations, decisions, and policies that reflect the performance of \nthe President’s constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties are adequately \ndocumented and that such records are preserved and maintained as Presidential records.” Id. \n§ 2203(a). \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 9 of 34\nII.  The Establishment of USDS and Its Limited Advisory Responsibilities  \nShortly after President Trump took office on January 20, 2025, he signed a series of \nExecutive Orders and a presidential memorandum concerning USDS. Because the Executive \nOrders  and  memorandum  are  dispositive  of  USDS’s  FOIA  status,  Defendants  discuss  a \nrepresentative sampling of them individually here.2 \nExecutive Order 14,158: On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order \n14,158, which redesignated the previously established United States Digital Service as the U.S. \nDOGE Service and charges it with implementing the President’s agenda of “improv[ing] the \nquality and efficiency of government-wide software, network infrastructure, and information \ntechnology (IT) systems.”  90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 20, 2025), §§ 3(a), 4 (“EO” or “Order”); see \nCompl. (ECF 1) ¶ 58.  The USDS sits within the Executive Office of the President (“EOP”).  See \nEO 14,158, § 3(a).  The EO further establishes a “U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization” \nwithin USDS pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 3161, which will terminate on July 4, 2026.  Id. § 3(b); see \nCompl. ¶ 59.  “The U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization shall be headed by the USDS \nAdministrator and shall be dedicated to advancing the President’s 18-month DOGE agenda.” EO \n14,158, § 3(b); see Compl. ¶ 59. \nEO 14,158 expressly distinguishes between USDS and other EOP components, on the one \nhand, and “Agencies” on the other.  The term “Agency” in the EO explicitly excludes “the \nExecutive Office of the President or any components thereof,” including USDS.  EO 14,158, \n§§ 2(a), 3(a).  However, “[i]n consultation with USDS, each Agency Head shall establish within \n \n2   The Court may consider these materials with this Rule 12(b)(6) motion because they: (i) are \nreferenced in the Complaint and central to Plaintiff’s claims; and/or (ii) are “public documents of \nwhich a court may take judicial notice.”  Sanders v. Kerry, 180 F. Supp. 3d 35, 41 (D.D.C. 2016) \n(cleaned up); see Hemphill v. Dep’t of Treasury, Civ. A. No. 21-0673 (TJK), 2021 WL 5038655, \nat *3 (D.D.C. Oct. 29, 2021), aff’d, No. 21-5261, 2022 WL 1701529 (D.C. Cir. May 25, 2022). \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 10 of 34\ntheir respective Agencies a DOGE Team of at least four employees, which may include Special \nGovernment Employees, hired or assigned within thirty days” of the EO to “implement[]” the \nPresident’s agenda.  Id. §§ 1, 3(c) (emphasis added); see Compl. ¶ 60.  The EO directs Agency \nHeads to select the DOGE Team members “in consultation with the USDS Administrator” and to \n“ensure that DOGE Team Leads coordinate their work with USDS and advise their respective \nAgency Heads on implementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” EO 14,158, § 3(c). \nSection 4 of the EO tasks the USDS Administrator with “commenc[ing] a Software \nModernization Initiative to improve the quality and efficiency of government-wide software, \nnetwork infrastructure, and information technology (IT) systems.”  Id. § 4(a); see Compl. ¶ 58. \nThe EO directs Agency Heads to “take all necessary steps, in coordination with the USDS \nAdministrator and to the maximum extent consistent with law, to ensure USDS has full and prompt \naccess to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems,” while also directing \nthat “USDS shall adhere to rigorous data protection standards.” EO 14,158, § 4(b). In other words, \nagency DOGE Teams composed of agency personnel who are selected by agency leadership and \nreport  up  agency  supervisory  chains  “take  all  necessary  steps”  within  their  agencies  and \n“coordinat[e]” with USDS on the President’s “DOGE Agenda.” Id. §§ 1, 3(c), 4(b). \nExecutive  Order  14,170:  Also  on  January  20,  President  Trump  signed  EO  14,170, \nReforming the Federal Hiring Process and Restoring Merit to Government Service, 90 Fed. Reg. \n8621 (Jan. 20, 2025).  That EO directs the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy, “in \nconsultation with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget [“OMB”], the Director of \nthe Office of Personnel Management [“OPM”], and the Administrator of” USDS to “develop and \nsend to agency heads a Federal Hiring Plan that brings to the Federal workforce only highly skilled \nAmericans dedicated to the furtherance of American ideals, values, and interests.” Id. § 2(a). The \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 11 of 34\nEO further states that the resulting federal hiring plan “shall provide specific best practices for the \nhuman resources function in each agency, which each agency head shall implement, with advice \nand recommendations as appropriate from” USDS. Id. § 2(d). \nExecutive  Order  14,210:  On  February  11,  2025,  the  President  issued  EO  14,210, \nImplementing the President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization \nInitiative, 90 Fed. Reg. 9669 (Feb. 11, 2025); see Compl. ¶ 62. EO 14,210 directs OMB to submit \na plan to reduce the size of the Federal Government workforce, EO 14,210, § 3(a), and directs \nAgency Heads to, among other things, “promptly undertake preparations to initiate large-scale \nreductions in force.” Id. § 3(c). It further tasks each “DOGE Team Lead”—defined as “the leader \nof the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) Team at each agency, as defined in EO \n14158,” id. § 2(c)—with several limited responsibilities. First, a DOGE Team Lead consults with \neach Agency Head on establishing a hiring plan. See id. § 3(b) (“Each Agency Head shall develop \na data-driven plan, in consultation with its DOGE Team Lead, to ensure new career appointment \nhires are in highest-need areas.”). Second, under such hiring plan, “new career appointment hiring \ndecisions shall be made in consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, consistent with \napplicable law.”  Id. § 3(b)(i).  Third, “[t]he agency shall not fill any vacancies for career \nappointments that the DOGE Team Lead assesses should not be filled, unless the Agency Head \ndetermines the positions should be filled.”  Id. § 3(b)(ii). Fourth, “[e]ach DOGE Team Lead shall \nprovide the” USDS Administrator “with a monthly hiring report for the agency.” Id. § 3(b)(iii). \nExecutive Order 14,218: On February 19, 2025, President Trump issued EO 14,218, \nEnding Taxpayer Subsidization of Open Borders, 90 Fed. Reg. 10581 (Feb. 19, 2025). EO 14,218 \ndirects the Director of OMB and the Administrator of USDS, in coordination with the Assistant to \nthe President for Domestic Policy, to “identify all other sources of Federal funding for illegal \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 12 of 34\naliens[,]” and “recommend additional agency actions to align Federal spending with the purposes \nof this order, and, where relevant, enhance eligibility verification systems.” Id. § 2(b)(i)–(ii). \nExecutive Order 14,219: Also on February 19, President Trump issued EO 14,219, \nEnsuring Lawful Governance and Implementing the President’s “Department of Government \nEfficiency” Deregulatory Initiative, 90 Fed. Reg. 10583 (Feb. 19, 2025). Under this EO, “Agency \nheads shall, in coordination with their DOGE Team Leads and the Director of [OMB], initiate a \nprocess to review all regulations subject to their sole or joint jurisdiction for consistency with law \nand Administration policy” and lists certain classes of regulations that Agency Heads must \nidentify. Id. § 2. “Additionally, agency heads shall consult with their DOGE Team Leads and the \nAdministrator of [the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs] on potential new regulations \nas soon as practicable.” Id. § 4. EO 14,219 does not mention USDS or assign any duties to it. \nExecutive  Order  14,222:  Executive  Order  14,222,  Implementing  the  President’s \n“Department of Government Efficiency” Cost Efficiency Initiative, 90 Fed. Reg. 11095 (Feb. 26, \n2025), states that “[e]ach Agency Head shall, with assistance as requested from the agency’s \nDOGE Team Lead,” among other steps “build a centralized technological system within the \nagency to seamlessly record every payment issued by the agency.”  Id. § 3(a); see also id. \n§§ 3(a)(i), (3)(b), 3(c), 3(d)(i) (identifying additional steps to be taken by agency heads in \nconsultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead).  The EO also directs each DOGE Team Lead \nto provide the Administrator with “a monthly informational report on contracting activities[,]” id. \n§ 3(d)(ii), and “to the extent consistent with law, provide the Administrator with a monthly \ninformational report listing each agency’s justifications for non- essential travel[,]” id. § 3(e). \nHiring Freeze Presidential Memorandum: In addition to these Executive Orders, a \nJanuary 20, 2025, presidential memorandum directs the OMB Director, “in consultation with” the \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 13 of 34\nOffice of Personnel Management (“OPM”) Director and USDS Administrator, to “submit a plan \nto reduce the size of the Federal Government’s workforce through efficiency improvements and \nattrition.” Hiring Freeze, The White House (Jan. 20, 2025), available at https://www.whitehouse. \ngov/presidentialactions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/.  The memorandum further states that the hiring \nfreeze directed by the memorandum remains in place for the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) \n“until  the  Secretary  of  the  Treasury,  in  consultation  with  the  Director  of  OMB  and  the \nAdministrator of USDS, determines that it is in the national interest to lift the freeze.” Id. \nIII.  This Litigation \nPlaintiff filed this matter on April 23, 2025, and purports to sue: (1) U.S. Department of \nGovernment Efficiency (“DOGE”); (2) U.S. DOGE Service (“USDS”); (3) U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization (“USDSTO”); (4) Elon Musk in his official capacity as head of the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency; (5) Steven Davis in his official capacity as head of the \nDepartment of Governmental Efficiency; (6) Amy Gleason in her official capacity as Acting \nAdministrator of the U.S. DOGE Service, (7) Marco A. Rubio in his official capacity as Acting \nArchivist of the United States; and (8) National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”) \n(collectively “Defendants”). See Compl. ¶¶ 12-22. The case concerns three FOIA requests that \nPlaintiff has made, as well as Plaintiff’s concerns about Defendants’ record keeping. \nOn January 22, 2025, Plaintiff sent letters to Elon Musk and various executive branch \nagencies to remind them about preserving federal records relating to DOGE. See Compl. ¶ 188. \nSince January 20, 2025, Plaintiff submitted at least thirty FOIA requests to DOGE. See id. ¶ 199. \nPlaintiff  has  requested  records  including  communications  from  USDS  officials,  internal \nmemoranda, and informal policy guidelines. See id. ¶¶ 204, 207, 211, 213. Plaintiff “will continue \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 14 of 34\nto submit FOIA requests to DOGE.” Id. ¶ 200. Plaintiff complains that Defendants have failed to \nrespond to their FOIA requests. Id. Counts IV-V.  \nPlaintiff also alleges that “DOGE’s use of Signal and Google Docs to conduct official \ngovernment business violates its record-keeping obligations because DOGE has not established \nmechanisms  that  ensure  federal  records  created  on  these  platforms  are  fully  preserved  on \ngovernment  recordkeeping  systems.”  Compl.  ¶  5.  Plaintiff  seeks  “to  prevent  the  unlawful \ndestruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to fulfill their legal obligations to preserve \nand recover federal records created through unauthorized use of Signal and Google Docs.” Id. ¶ 5. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nRule 12(b)(6) permits a defendant to move for dismissal on the ground that the complaint \nhas failed “to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.” Such a motion “tests the legal \nsufficiency of a complaint.” Browning v. Clinton, 292 F.3d 235, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2002). To \nwithstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as \ntrue, to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “A claim has facial plausibility when the \nPlaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the \ndefendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. A complaint containing only “[t]hreadbare \nrecitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements” cannot \nsurvive a motion to dismiss. Id. In addition, the presumption of truth accorded factual allegations \nat this stage does not apply to legal conclusions in a complaint, including those “couched” as \nfactual allegations. Id. (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). \nOn a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider “the facts alleged in the complaint, \ndocuments attached as exhibits or incorporated by reference in the complaint,” or “documents \nupon which the plaintiff’s complaint necessarily relies even if the document is produced not by \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 15 of 34\nthe plaintiff in the complaint but by the defendant in a motion to dismiss.” Ward v. Dist. of \nColumbia Dep’t of Youth Rehab. Servs., 768 F. Supp. 2d 117, 119 (D.D.C. 2011) (citations \nomitted); accord Hemphill, 2021 WL 5038655, at *3. A court may also consider judicially \nnoticeable documents or facts without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary \njudgment. Sodexo Operations, LLC v. Not-For-Profit Hosp. Corp., 264 F. Supp. 3d 262, 264 \n(D.D.C. 2017); Sanders, 180 F. Supp. 3d at 41; see also Abhe & Svoboda, Inc. v. Chao, 508 F.3d \n1052, 1059 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“In determining whether a complaint states a claim, court may \nconsider the facts alleged in the complaint, documents attached thereto or incorporated therein, \nand matters of which it may take judicial notice.” (citation omitted)). \nARGUMENTS \nI.  Plaintiff Fails to Plausibly Allege that USDS is an “Agency” \nFOIA’s record disclosure requirements apply only to federal “agencies.” Legal Eagle, LLC \nv. Nat’l Sec. Council Records Access & Info.

Podesta, 643 F. Supp. 3d 121, 126 (D.D.C. \n2022). That is, FOIA requires “[e]ach agency” to make available to the public non-exempt agency \nrecords, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and “confers jurisdiction on the district courts ‘to enjoin the agency from \nwithholding agency records and to order the  production of any  agency records improperly \nwithheld.’”  Dep’t  of  Just.  v.  Tax  Analysts,  492  U.S.  136,  142  (1989)  (quoting  5  U.S.C. \n§ 552(a)(4)(B)); see also Kissinger v. Reps. Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 445 U.S. 136, 150 \n(1980) (“federal jurisdiction [under FOIA] is dependent upon a showing that an agency has \n(1) ‘improperly’; (2) ‘withheld’; (3) ‘agency records’” (quoting 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B)). If a \ndocument is not a federal record created by an agency, and is instead a presidential record covered \nby the PRA, that document is not subject to FOIA. Armstrong v. EOP (“Armstrong II”), 1 F.3d \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 16 of 34\n1274, 1292 (D.C. Cir. 1993). The PRA specifies that its definition of official records of an agency \nis the same as that used in FOIA and that the statutes are mutually exclusive. See 44 U.S.C. § \n2201(2)(B). Put simply, if a record is not an official record of an agency, it is not subject to the \nFRA or FOIA. \nWhether an entity is an “agency” is properly resolved on a motion to dismiss pursuant to \nRule 12(b)(6). See Legal Eagle, 2021 WL 1061222, at *3–4; Cause of Action Inst. v. OMB, 10 \nF.4th 849, 854 (D.C. Cir. 2021). “Where, as here, the defendant is a unit within the Executive \nOffice of the President,” a plaintiff’s “conclusory pleading of agency status [i]s insufficient.” Main \nSt. Legal Servs., Inc. v. Nat’l Sec. Council, 811 F.3d 542, 567 (2d Cir. 2016); see Iqbal, 556 U.S. \nat 681 (“conclusory” allegations and “bare assertions” “not entitled to be assumed true”). Instead, \n“[t]o state a claim for relief under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), a plaintiff must plausibly allege, among \nother things, that the defendant is an agency subject to the FOIA.” Main St. Legal Servs., 811 F.3d \nat 567. Plaintiff fails to meet that burden here. \nA.  EOP  Units  that  Lack  Substantial  Authority  to  Act  Independently  of  the \nPresident, Whose Sole Purpose Is Instead to Advise or Assist the President, \nAre Not “Agencies” \nAs  amended  in  1974,  FOIA  defines  the  term  “agency”  to  include  “any  executive \ndepartment, military department, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, or \nother establishment in the executive branch of the Government (including the Executive Office of \nthe President), or any independent regulatory agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(f). Although the text \nreferences the “Executive Office of the President,” the term “agency” does not include every \ncomponent  in  that  office,  but  only  components  that  fall  within  the  specified  list  items \n(“department,” “corporation,” or “other establishment”). An EOP component that does not qualify \nas a department, corporation, or establishment is not subject to FOIA. That understanding is \nconsistent with the term being defined (“agency”), which does not naturally refer to entities that \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 17 of 34\nlack formal structure or independent authority, such as the White House Office, the National \nSecurity Council, or the Office of Administration. See, e.g., Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, \n861 (2014) (noting that it is reasonable to consider the ordinary meaning of a defined term in \ninterpreting the scope of a statutorily provided definition).  \nAccordingly, the Conference Committee Report accompanying the 1974 amendments to \nFOIA, which added the reference to the “Executive Office of the President,” explains that the term \n“Executive Office of the President” is “not to be interpreted as including the President’s immediate \npersonal staff or units in the Executive Office whose sole function is to advise and assist the \nPresident.” S. Rep. No. 93-1200, at 15 (1974) (Conf. Rep.), reprinted in 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6285, \n6293; H.R. Rep. No. 93-1380, at 15 (1974) (Conf. Rep.) (same). Citing this “unambiguous” \nlegislative history, the Supreme Court held that the “‘Executive Office’ does not include the Office \nof the President,” and that “‘the President’s immediate personal staff or units in the Executive \nOffice whose sole function is to advise and assist the President’ are not included within the term \n‘agency’ under the FOIA.” Kissinger, 445 U.S. at 156 (quoting H.R. Rep. No. 93-1380, at 15 \n(1974) (Conf. Rep.)); see also Meyer v. Bush, 981 F.2d 1288, 1293 n.3 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (FOIA \nexcludes “at least those approximately 400 individuals employed in the White House Office” who \nare the President’s immediate personal staff). \nThe legislative history also makes clear that Congress intended to codify the D.C. Circuit’s \ndecision in Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067 (D.C. Cir. 1971). See 1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6293 \n(“[w]ith respect to the meaning of the term ‘Executive Office of the President’ the conferees intend \nthe result reached in Soucie v. David, 448 F.2d 1067”); Armstrong v. EOP (“Armstrong III”), 90 \nF.3d 553, 558 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“That the Congress intended to codify Soucie is clear enough.”); \naccord Meyer, 981 F.2d at 1291. Soucie considered whether the Office of Science and Technology \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 18 of 34\n(“OST”), an EOP component now known as the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n(“OSTP”), was an “agency” subject to FOIA. The D.C. Circuit held that it was, because, beyond \nits duties of advising the President, OSTP also had the “independent function of evaluating federal \n[scientific] programs.” 448 F.2d at 1075. When OSTP inherited that function from one of its \npredecessor organizations, the court noted, both Congress and the President contemplated that \nCongress would “retain control over information on federal programs accumulated by the OST, \ndespite any confidential relation between the Director of the OST and the President.” Id. OSTP \nwas found to be a FOIA agency because it did not have the “sole function” of advising and assisting \nthe President and instead had “substantial independent authority in the exercise of specific \nfunctions.” Id. at 1073. Namely, OSTP had “independent authority to evaluate federal scientific \nresearch programs, initiate and fund research projects, and award scholarships.” Citizens for Resp. \n& Ethics in Wash. (“CREW”) v. Office of Admin., 566 F.3d 219, 223 (D.C. Cir. 2009); see also \nRushforth v. Council of Econ. Advisers, 762 F.2d 1038, 1041 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“OST could take \ndirect action and thus was deemed to be an administrative agency”); Meyer, 981 F.2d at 1292 \n(“OST was a FOIA agency precisely because it could act directly and independently beyond \nadvising and assisting the President.”). \nB.  USDS’s  Charter  Documents  Do  Not  Demonstrate  Intent  to  Delegate  the \nPresident’s Own Authority to USDS \nPlaintiff’s conclusory allegations regarding USDS’s status (Compl. ¶¶ 2-3, 12-14), cannot \nstate a claim. Main St. Legal Servs., 811 F.3d at 567; see also, e.g., Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on \nForeign Inv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 315 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (courts “do not accept as true . . . the \nplaintiff’s legal conclusions”). Instead, the Court should evaluate whether USDS “lacks substantial \nindependent authority and is therefore not an agency under FOIA.” CREW, 566 F.3d at 224. Courts \nanswer that question by discerning an entity’s (here, USDS’s) legal authority under the governing \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 19 of 34\nstatutes, regulations, or executive orders and thereby identifying the functions that the USDS “[i]s \nauthorized” to perform. Cotton v. Heyman, 63 F.3d 1115, 1121 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see id. at 1122 \n(the “important consideration regarding agency status” is “whether the relevant entity had ‘any \nauthority in law to make decisions’” (citation omitted)). The authority must be formal, as “any \ninquiry into whether an entity is an agency for the purposes of the Freedom of Information Act \ncannot turn on the entity’s ability to persuade.” U.S. Doge Serv. v. CREW, No. 24-1246, 2025 U.S. \nLEXIS 2202, *1 (S. Ct. June 6, 2025). \nIn certain contexts, the D.C. Circuit has applied a three-factor test to determine whether an \nentity wields “substantial independent authority,” which looks at: (1) “how close operationally [the \nentity] is to the President,” (2) “whether it has a self-contained structure,” and (3) “the nature of \nits delegated authority.” CREW, 566 F.3d at 222 (cleaned up). The test was first articulated in \nMeyer, where the D.C. Circuit held that a group of senior advisers to the President working within \nthe EOP as the Task Force on Regulatory Relief did not constitute an “agency” under FOIA, even \nthough the group “evaluated agency regulatory efforts and had authority to provide some direction \nover agency rulemaking.” 981 F.2d at 1292. The D.C. Circuit later applied the test to hold that the \nNational Security Council, which is headed by the President and is authorized to provide guidance \nand policy direction for national security issues, is not an “agency” subject to FOIA. Armstrong \nIII, 90 F.3d at 567; id. at 558 (“These three factors are not necessarily to be weighed equally; \nrather, each factor warrants consideration insofar as it is illuminating in the particular case.”). \nTo be clear, the Court is not required to apply the three-factor test in resolving USDS’s \nagency status. This is because “common to every case in which we have held that an EOP unit is \nsubject to FOIA has been a finding that the entity in question wielded substantial authority \nindependently of the President.” CREW, 566 F.3d at 222 (quotations omitted) (not analyzing \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 20 of 34\nMeyer factors); see also Competitive Enter., 643 F. Supp. 3d at 127 (the “lodestar” of the Court’s \nanalysis remains whether the entity in question exercises “‘substantial independent authority’” \n(quoting Armstrong III, 90 F.3d at 557–58)).3 In any case, whether considered individually or \n“conglomerated,” Competitive Enter., 643 F. Supp. 3d at 127 n.2, the three factors underscore that \nUSDS lacks substantial independent authority and is thus not an “agency” subject to FOIA. \ni.  Operational Proximity \nThe January 20, 2025, Executive Order establishing USDS makes clear that USDS is \noperationally close to the President. EO 14,158 reorganized and renamed the United States Digital \nService “as the United States DOGE Service (USDS),” and established it “in the Executive Office \nof the President.” EO 14,158, § 3(a). The EO further establishes “a USDS Administrator in the \nExecutive Office of the President who shall report to the White House Chief of Staff.” Id. § 3(b). \nThe EO explicitly distinguishes USDS and the USDS Administrator, on the one hand, from \n“Agencies” (which are defined not to include the EOP or components thereof) and “DOGE Teams” \nwithin the respective Agencies, on the other. Id. §§ 2(a), 3(c). \nii.  Lack of Self-Contained Structure  \nAlthough least important of the three factors, the second factor also favors the conclusion \nthat USDS is not an “agency” because it is a non-statutory entity that would not be able to exercise \nindependent authority if so delegated. See Armstrong III, 90 F.3d at 558-560 (“[W]hile a definite \nstructure may be a prerequisite to qualify as an establishment within the executive branch . . . not \n \n3   The D.C. Circuit has suggested the test need be applied only where the entity at issue \nsupervises other Executive Branch components. See Armstrong III, 90 F.3d at 558 (test is “relevant \nto determining whether those who both advise the President and supervise others in the Executive \nBranch exercise ‘substantial independent authority’ and hence should be deemed an agency \nsubject to the FOIA” (emphasis added)); Meyer, 981 F.2d at 1293 (“when we apply Soucie to those \nwho help the President supervise others in the executive branch, we think it is necessary to focus \non three interrelated factors” (emphasis added)). USDS lacks such supervisory authority. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 21 of 34\nevery establishment is an agency under the FOIA.”; even if an office “has a structure sufficiently \nself-contained that the entity could exercise substantial independent authority . . . [t]he remaining \nquestion is whether the [entity] does in fact exercise such authority.” (cleaned up and citations \nomitted)); see also Meyer, 981 F.2d at 1296 (“FOIA, by declaring that only ‘establishments in the \nexecutive branch’ are covered, 5 U.S.C. § 552(e), requires a definite structure for agency status.”). \niii.  Nature of Delegated Authority \nConcerning the third factor (nature of the delegation), as the Executive Orders  and \npresidential  memorandum  collectively  demonstrate,  USDS  has  a  limited  set  of  advisory \nresponsibilities, none of which even arguably involves the authority to direct agencies or other \ncomponents of the executive branch. Specifically, according to its charter documents, USDS has \nthe following tasks and responsibilities, inter alia: \n•  The USDS Administrator is to commence a software modernization initiative and “work \nwith Agency Heads to promote inter-operability between agency networks and systems, \nensure data integrity, and facilitate responsible data collection and synchronization.” EO \n14,158, § 4(a). \n \n•  The USDS Administrator should, “to the maximum extent consistent with law,” have “full \nand prompt access to all unclassified agency records, software systems, and IT systems.” \nId. § 4(b). \n \n•  USDS  may  provide  “advice  and  recommendations  as  appropriate”  concerning \nimplementation of the federal hiring plan developed by the Assistant to the President for \nDomestic Policy. EO 14,170, § 2(d). \n \n•  The Administrator of USDS, with the OMB Director and in coordination with the Assistant \nto the President for Domestic Policy, is directed to identify sources of federal funding for \nillegal aliens and make various recommendations. EO 14,218, § 2(b)(i)–(ii). \n \nIn addition, according to the charter documents, agencies and other entities are directed to \n“coordinate” or “consult” with USDS as follows, inter alia: \n•  Agency Heads are directed to establish an Agency DOGE Team within their respective \nAgencies  “in  consultation  with  USDS,”  and  to  select  DOGE  Team  members  “in \nconsultation with the USDS Administrator.” EO 14,158, § 3(c). \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 22 of 34\n \n•  Agency DOGE Teams—which are employees of the respective agencies—are tasked \ngenerally with “coordinat[ing] their work with USDS,” while “advis[ing] their respective \nAgency Heads on implementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” Id. § 3(c). \n \n•  USDS receives from each Agency DOGE Team Lead “a monthly informational report on \ncontracting activities,” EO 14,222, § 3(d)(ii), as well as “to the extent consistent with law,” \n“a  monthly  informational  report  listing  each  agency’s  justifications  for  nonessential \ntravel,” id. § 3(e). \n \n•  The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy is directed to develop a federal hiring \nplan “in consultation with” the USDS Administrator (as well as the Directors of OMB and \nOPM). EO 14,170, § 2(a). \n \n•  USDS  receives  monthly  hiring  reports  from  each  DOGE  Team  Lead.  EO  14,210, \n§ 3(b)(iii). \n \n•  The OMB Director is directed to “consult[]” with the USDS Administrator (as well as the \nOPM Director) to submit a plan to reduce the size of the federal workforce. See Hiring \nFreeze,  The  White  House  (Jan.  20,  2025),  https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-\nactions/2025/01/hiring-freeze/. \n \n•  The Secretary of the Treasury is directed to “consult[]” with the USDS Administrator (as \nwell as the OMB Director) in determining whether it is in the national interest to lift the \ncurrent IRS hiring freeze. Id. \n \nNone of the limited responsibilities assigned to USDS—which are purely advisory and \nconsultative in nature—can plausibly be characterized as “authority” delegated to USDS, let alone \nauthority that is independent of the President. Accord, e.g., CREW, 566 F.3d at 224 (Office of \nAdministration not agency under FOIA because “everything the Office of Administration does is \ndirectly related to the operational and administrative support of the work of the President and his \nEOP staff”); Armstrong III, 90 F.3d at 553 (National Security Council (“NSC”) not a FOIA agency \nbecause neither the President nor Congress delegated any function to the NSC other than that of \nadvising and assisting President); Rushforth, 762 F.2d at 1043 (Council of Economic Advisers \n(“CEA”) not a FOIA agency for, while CEA has duties prescribed by statute (unlike USDS), each \nof its enumerated statutory duties is directed at providing advice and assistance to the President, \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 23 of 34\nand neither the governing statute nor any executive order gives CEA any regulatory power); \nCREW, 2025 U.S. LEXIS 2202, at *1 (“any inquiry into whether an entity is an agency for the \npurposes of the Freedom of Information Act cannot turn on the entity’s ability to persuade”). \nUSDS’s status as a non-agency is even more clear when one contrasts the EOP components \nthat the D.C. Circuit has held to be FOIA agencies. In Soucie, as discussed, the D.C. Circuit held \nthat OSTP was a FOIA agency because it had independent authority “to evaluate federal scientific \nresearch programs, initiate and fund research projects, and award scholarships.” CREW, 566 F.3d \nat 223 (discussing Soucie, 448 F.2d at 1073–75). OMB is a FOIA agency because of its statutory \nduty to provide budget information to Congress, along with “numerous other statutory duties.” \nSierra Club v. Andrus, 581 F.2d 895, 902 (D.C. Cir. 1978), rev’d on other grounds, 442 U.S. 347 \n(1979); see also id. at 902 n.25 (noting OMB’s authority to “assemble, correlate, revise, reduce, \nor increase the requests for appropriations of the several departments or establishments”). And the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality (“CEQ”) has been deemed a FOIA agency based on the \ndetermination that it had independent authority to coordinate federal environmental regulatory \nprograms,  issue  guidelines  for  preparing  environmental  impact  statements,  and  promulgate \nregulations—legally binding on the agencies4—for implementing procedural provisions of the \nNational Environmental Policy Act. See Pac. Legal Found. v. Council on Env’t Quality, 636 F.2d \n1259, 1262–63 (D.C. Cir. 1980). \nUSDS is nothing like the EOP components found to have agency status. Unlike OMB’s \nsignificant statutory responsibilities, USDS has no statutory responsibilities (and indeed, no \n \n4   But see Marin Audubon Soc’y v. FAA, 121 F.4th 902, 908 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (holding that \nthe “CEQ regulations, which purport to govern how all federal agencies must comply with the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, are ultra vires”), reh’g en banc denied, 2025 WL 374897 \n(D.C. Cir. Jan. 31, 2025), mandate stayed by 129 F.4th 869 (Feb. 28, 2025). Defendants do not \naddress the merits of that decision here. \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 24 of 34\nspecific statutory recognition). And unlike the heads of OMB, CEQ, and OSTP, the USDS \nAdministrator is not a position that requires Senate confirmation; indeed, it is not even a statutorily \ncreated position. Compare Sierra Club, 581 F.2d at 902 (noting that “Congress signified the \nimportance of OMB’s power and function, over and above its role as presidential advisor, when it \nprovided, also by amendment in 1974, for Senate confirmation of the Director and Deputy Director \nof the OMB”); see also 42 U.S.C. § 4342 (Senate confirmation of the head of CEQ); 42 U.S.C. \n§ 6612 (same for head of OSTP). USDS has no power (unlike CEQ) to issue regulations, let alone \nregulations that apply throughout the executive branch. Nor does USDS have powers analogous \nto those OSTP has over research projects, scholarships, and scientific research programs. \nDefendants recognize that another Judge in this District found that USDS “likely” had \nagency status under FOIA—at least, as the Court emphasized, “on th[e] preliminary record” before \nit when issuing a preservation order pending litigation.  CREW v. U.S. DOGE Serv., 769 F. Supp. \n3d 8, 23 (D.D.C. 2025) (“CREW FOIA case”), reconsideration denied, 2025 WL 863947 (Mar. \n19, 2025). That decision, as it acknowledged, relied heavily on hearsay media reports referring to \n“DOGE” generally, not USDS in particular. Id. at 26. The decision also placed substantial weight \non the phrasing of EO 14,158 in describing the purpose of “the President’s ‘Department of \nGovernment Efficiency’” as to “implement the President’s DOGE agenda.”  Id. at 23.  But that \nverbiage appears in prefatory language in the EO, and the “Department of Government Efficiency” \nincludes both USDS and agency DOGE Teams, the latter of which are comprised of agency \npersonnel reporting up agency chains and responsible for implementing the President’s DOGE \nagenda within their respective agencies. This decision was further undermined when the Supreme \nCourt granted the government’s application for a stay. CREW, 2025 U.S. LEXIS 2202 (S. Ct. June \n6, 2025).  And in any event, the abstract notion of “implement[ing]” a policy “agenda” does not \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 25 of 34\nequate  to  wielding  substantial  independent  authority,  particularly  where  the  more  specific \nresponsibilities attributed to USDS are all advisory and consultative in nature.  See id.; see also \nCotton, 63 F.3d at 1121, 1122. \nIn addition, EO 14,158 makes clear that its stated purpose is to be carried out by the totality \nof the “DOGE Structure,” which includes not only USDS and USDSTO, but also the DOGE Teams \nthat are in agencies and are comprised of agency personnel.  EO 14158, § 3(a)–(c). To the extent \nany part of the “DOGE Structure” plays an implementation role, the EOs indicate that it is the \nagency DOGE Teams that do so, advising and consulting with agency heads on implementation \nactions within agencies, as discussed above.  The opinion in the CREW FOIA case failed to \nappreciate this distinction. E.g., 769 F. Supp. 3d at 24 (describing EO that “grants the USDS Team \nLead the power to keep vacant career positions open unless an agency overrides their decision”); \nid. at 25 (including “DOGE teams” as part of USDS’s “defined staff” rather than part of an \nagency’s staff).  The authorities or activities of DOGE Teams are  irrelevant to the question of \nwhether USDS itself is an “agency.”  The fact that DOGE Teams are already part of the agencies \nwhere they are embedded means that their records are already governed by the agencies’ FRA \nrequirements and are subject to FOIA to the same extent any other records within those agencies \nmight be.  In sum, this Court should not follow the CREW FOIA decision.5 Because Plaintiff has \n \n5   Plaintiff cites a preliminary ruling of another Judge in this District on a motion for \ntemporary restraining order to restrain the Department of Labor, the Department of Health and \nHuman  Services,  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau,  and  the  USDS  entities  from \nproviding any person outside the three agencies—namely, DOGE personnel—with access to \nrecords systems containing personal information or data. Compl. ¶ 63 (citing Am. Fed’n of Labor \n& Cong. of Indus. Orgs. v. Dep’t of Labor, 766 F. Supp. 3d 105, 112-13 (D.D.C. 2025) (concluding \nthat “[P]laintiffs have not shown a substantial likelihood that USDS is not an agency” for purposes \nof the Economy Act of 1932 and therefore not permitted consistent with the Privacy Act to access \nagency’s record systems)). But that court, which addressed the issue in an expedited posture, in a \ndifferent substantive context, misinterpreted the Order establishing USDS, similar to the Court in \nthe CREW FOIA case. Id. \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 26 of 34\nnot met its burden to plausibly allege that USDS is an agency, the Court should dismiss Plaintiff’s \nComplaint against the USDS Defendants pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). \nII.  Counts I, II and III Fail to State A Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted \nA.  Plaintiff Is Barred from Bringing a Broad Programmatic Attack on USDS’s \nRecordkeeping Practices \nAs stated above, USDS is not subject to the FRA, and the entire Complaint should be \ndismissed on that basis. However, Counts I and II can also be dismissed to the extent they challenge \nUSDS’s recordkeeping practices as a whole because that is not a permissible FRA claim. The D.C. \nCircuit has held that the FRA “does not contain an express or implied private right of action.” \nJud. Watch, Inc. v. Kerry, 844 F.3d 952, 954 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (citing Kissinger, 445 U.S. at 148-\n50). Accordingly, a plaintiff seeking to assert a violation of the FRA must rely on the causes of \naction set forth in the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706. And the APA limits a plaintiff to challenging a final \n“discrete agency action”; it cannot simply mount a “‘broad programmatic attack’ on an agency’s \ncompliance with a statutory scheme.” CREW v. DHS, 387 F. Supp. 3d 33, 49 (D.D.C. 2019), \namended, Civ. A. No. 18-2473 (RC), 2019 WL 11307644 (D.D.C. July 22, 2019).  \nThe upshot of these limitations is that the only permissible challenges are those challenging \na specific recordkeeping guideline or directive as somehow inadequate under the FRA or that \nclaim that agency heads or NARA violated their non-discretionary duties to initiate an enforcement \naction through the Attorney General. For example, in Armstrong I, the court allowed an APA \nclaim that an agency’s “recordkeeping guidelines and directives do not adequately describe the \nmaterial that must be retained as ‘records’ under the FRA.” Armstrong I, 924 F.2d at 292. \nHere, Plaintiff’s FRA-related claims are generally challenging Defendant’s recordkeeping, \nnone of which is sufficiently limited to comport with the restrictions of Armstrong or the APA. \nRather than challenging a discrete written guideline, Plaintiff purports to challenge the entire record \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 27 of 34\nmanagement  practice6  as  “inadequate,  arbitrary,  [and]  capricious,”  because  USDS  uses \n“ephemeral messaging systems,” Compl. ¶¶ 232, 249, and due to the alleged wholesale failure to \n“preserve and recover records” under the FRA, id. ¶¶ 238, 254; Plaintiff seeks generally to compel \nUSDS to comply with the FRA’s and FOIA’s statutory schemes. Per Plaintiff’s request for relief, \nit asks the Court to declare that “Defendants have maintained an inadequate recordkeeping system \nunder the FRA” and seeks an order for “preservation of records, recovery of unlawfully removed \nrecords, and the recovery or restoration of any deleted or destroyed materials to the extent \npossible.” Id. \nSuch broad, programmatic relief, which calls on the Court to undertake an ongoing \noversight role to implement wholesale improvement of government practices, is prohibited under \nthe APA and far outside the scope of the limited review that Armstrong I permits. See, e.g., Animal \nLegal Def. Fund, Inc. v. Vilsack, 111 F.4th 1219, 1232 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (Katsas, J., concurring) \n(APA requires plaintiffs “to focus their claims on ‘discrete’ as opposed to‘ programmatic’ agency \nactions”); Jones v. Secret Serv., 701 F. Supp. 3d 4, 17 (D.D.C. 2023) (dismissing claim alleging \n“ongoing ‘failure to properly train’ officers,” because APA did not allow programmatic challenge \nseeking “wholesale improvement” by court decree of an alleged “ongoing unlawful practice”). \n \n6   USDS has continually emphasized their preservation efforts. USDS considers themselves \nsubject to the PRA, as reflected in Defendant Gleason’s declaration in prior litigation, CREW v. \nU.S. Doge Serv., Civ. A. No. 25-0511 (CRC), 2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 93437 (D.D.C. Apr. 15, \n2025), ECF No. 24-2, and its records retention policy, see Am. Oversight v. Dept. of Govt. \nEfficiency, Civ. A. No. 25-0409 (BAH), ECF No. 13-2 (USDS Records Retention Policy); Compl. \n¶¶ 183, 186. USDS’s Records Retention Policy instructs employees to preserve all work-related \nrecords and communications regardless of format, including communications exchanged  on \nprivate messaging platforms such as Signal. See USDS Records Retention Policy. Employees are \ninstructed to “[d]isabl[e] auto-delete features on any such messaging services” to “help with \nretention and compliance.” Id. Employees are advised to use government-issued devices for work-\nrelated communications and forward to their government accounts any work-related messages that \nthey receive on personal email or other personal messaging accounts. Id. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 28 of 34\nPlaintiff does not ask the Court to review a specific recordkeeping guideline or directive. \nIt asks the Court to say that the use of messaging systems Plaintiff apparently does not trust falls \nunder the FRA and that Defendants must follow the FRA. An order compelling such relief would \ninvolve ongoing programmatic oversight—the very type of claim that is prohibited under the APA. \nB.  Plaintiff Fails to State a Claim Against NARA and Defendant Rubio related to \nthe FRA’s Referral Obligation. \nCount III alleges that NARA and Acting Archivist Rubio violated their non-discretionary \nduty to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General for the unlawful removal of \nrecords. Compl. at 50. However, Plaintiff fails to plausibly allege an essential element of that \nclaim. NARA’s non-discretionary referral duty arises only if the Archivist knows or has reason to \nknow about the unlawful removal of records by USDS officials. See 44 U.S.C. § 3106. The \nComplaint alleges in conclusory terms that NARA and Archivist Rubio were on such notice of \nunlawful removals, Compl. ¶ 261, but the January 22, 2025, letter from Plaintiff on which the \nComplaint relies as evidence of such notice contradicts this claim. \nCuriously, the Complaint attaches only NARA’s response to the January 22, 2025, letter, \nbut the letter itself, which the Complaint incorporates by reference, see Compl. ¶ 188, provides the \nonly textual evidence of what Plaintiff stated to NARA. See Defs.’ Ex. A. Fatal to Plaintiff’s FRA \nenforcement claim, the January 22, 2025, letter relies exclusively on reports that DOGE officials \nuse Signal to communicate without asserting any evidence that the platform was used unlawfully. \nId. The letter mentions that Signal has automatic deletion capabilities but does not provide any \nevidence stating that such functionality had been engaged by government officials. Id. Rather, \nPlaintiff’s letter speaks in terms of “concerns” that the Signal records “may not have been” \nappropriately  preserved  and  the  “possibility”  that  USDS  was  using  ephemeral  messaging \napplications in violation of the FRA. Id. Further underscoring the speculative nature of those \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 29 of 34\nconcerns, the letter concludes that “[i]f there is any reason to believe that such records have been \nunlawfully removed, American Oversight urges you to undertake an enforcement action.” Id. The \nletter does not mention Google Docs or Mattermost. \nNARA did not initiate an enforcement action because none was warranted. Assuming, for \nthe sake of argument, that DOGE is a federal agency subject to the FRA, the use of Signal to \nconduct official business, without more, does not violate that law. Some executive branch officials \nuse Signal because of the enhanced security features it offers, or because it allows inter-executive \nbranch coordination in real time. Signal often comes pre-installed on government-issued cell \nphones and even desktop computers, in which case the records never leave agency custody. See \n36 C.F.R. § 1230.3 (defining “removal” as records “leav[ing] the custody of a Federal agency \nwithout the permission of the Archivist of the United States”). And federal employees may send \nor receive messages on unofficial accounts, such as those connected with personal devices, if they \ncopy an official account at the time of transmission or forward the message to their account within \n20 days. See 44 U.S.C. § 2911. The same is true for White House employees subject to the PRA. \n44 U.S.C. § 2209. Thus, neither Plaintiff’s January 22, 2025, letter to NARA, nor the media reports \nit cites, placed NARA on notice that DOGE officials used Signal unlawfully on personal devices \n(with the auto-delete function enabled, and failure to copy an official account at the time of \ntransmission or forward the messages on to an official account). Because Plaintiff has failed to \nplausibly allege that NARA had any knowledge that USDS used Signal to violate the FRA, it has \nfailed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted for Count III. \nC.  Two of Plaintiff’s FRA Claims Are Barred Under 5 U.S.C. § 704 Because \nFOIA Provides an Adequate Remedy \nEven if the Court were to construe Plaintiff’s Counts I and II narrowly to avoid a broad \nprogrammatic attack, and instead view them as seeking nothing more than a ruling that USDS is \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 30 of 34\nan “agency” under the FRA and FOIA (thus leaving it to USDS to take any further appropriate \nactions in conformity with that ruling), that remedy is also barred under the circumstances here. \nAs described above, Plaintiff’s claims invoke the APA’s cause of action in 5 U.S.C. § 706. Compl. \n¶¶ 242, 258. However, that cause of action is unavailable where there exists another “adequate \nremedy in a court.” 5 U.S.C. § 704. Thus, where FOIA provides a remedy, a plaintiff cannot seek \nsuch relief through a separate APA claim that alleges an FRA violation. CEI v. Off. of Science & \nTech. Policy, 82 F. Supp. 3d 228, 234 (D.D.C. 2015) (dismissing APA claim “[b]ecause FOIA \nprovides its own remedial scheme”), reversed on other grounds, 827 F.3d 145 (D.C. Cir. 2016); \ncf. Feinman v. FBI, 713 F. Supp. 2d 70, 76–77 (D.D.C. 2010) (recognizing that FOIA claims allow \nfor challenges to agency policies as well as an agency’s response to a specific FOIA request).  \nFour of Plaintiff’s five claims here all seek the same determination from the Court—that \nUSDS is an “agency” for purposes of the FRA and FOIA and is therefore subject to FRA rather \nthan PRA recordkeeping requirements as well as FOIA’s framework for making nonexempt \nagency records publicly available. See Compl. ¶¶ 228, 244, 251, 269-71, 275-80. Those counts do \nnot invoke unique FRA remedies by, for example, seeking to compel those statutes’ administrative \nenforcement mechanisms to recover removed records or avoid their destruction. Cf. Armstrong I, \n924 F.2d at 295-96 (describing challenge to agency’s or Archivist’s decision not to initiate \nenforcement action); See Democracy Forward Found. v. Pompeo, 474 F. Supp. 3d 138, 144 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (claim sought to compel administrative enforcement action). Nor do any of \nPlaintiff’s claims seek to correct supposed defects in USDS’s Records Policy or challenge the \nscope of the policy. Instead, Plaintiff seeks a ruling that USDS is an “agency.” Indeed, as discussed \nabove, that is the only relief this Court could grant regarding Counts I and II without becoming \nenmeshed in impermissible oversight of the development and implementation of an entire FRA \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 31 of 34\nrecordkeeping scheme. But that remedy is already available through the FOIA causes of action \nraised in both the CREW FOIA case and Plaintiff’s FOIA case in front of Judge Howell, Am. \nOversight v. U.S. Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, Civ. A. No. 25-0409 (BAH). Thus far, the CREW \nFOIA case has proceeded furthest in adjudicating the issue, and the issue is likely to be resolved, \none way or another, through that case. \nIndeed,  the  issue  of  whether  an  entity  qualifies  as  an  “agency”  has  typically  been \nadjudicated through FOIA, not through the FRA. See, e.g., Main St. Legal Servs., 811 F.3d at 543–\n44 (FOIA case affirming district court’s decision that NSC was not an agency subject to FOIA and \nrecognizing “the FOIA’s agency requirement to relate to the court’s remedial power”); CREW, \n566  F.3d  at  220-21  (FOIA  case  affirming  district  court’s  determination  that  Office  of \nAdministration is not an agency subject to FOIA); Meyer, 981 F.2d at 1298 (FOIA case holding \nPresident’s Task Force on Regulatory Relief was not an agency); Rushforth, 762 F.2d at 1038–40, \n1043 (FOIA case affirming district court’s conclusion that Council of Economic Advisers is not \nan agency); Soucie, 448 F.2d at 1070 (FOIA case holding that Office of Science and Technology \nwas an agency); Indiana v. Biden, 652 F. Supp. 3d 995, 1006-07 (S.D. Ind. 2023) (FOIA case \nholding Domestic Policy Council was not an agency); Democracy Forward Found. v. White House \nOff. of Am. Innovation, 356 F. Supp. 3d 61, 62 (D.D.C. 2019) (FOIA case holding that defendant \nwas not an agency); see also Pac. Legal Found., 636 F.2d at 1261 (on claim brought pursuant to \nSunshine Act’s right of action, holding Council on Environmental Quality is an agency).  \nThe remedy available through FOIA is thus undoubtedly adequate. A final ruling on the \nplaintiff’s FOIA claim in the CREW FOIA case will determine whether or not USDS is an agency \nfor FRA and FOIA purposes. If the final ruling is that USDS is an agency, USDS presumably will \ntake the necessary steps to conform its recordkeeping and FOIA response protocols accordingly. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 32 of 34\nAnd regardless of the outcome, that ruling will render two of Plaintiff’s claims here moot. \nAccordingly, under § 704, the APA’s cause of action is not available in this circumstance.   \nIII.  Defendants Musk and Davis Should Be Dismissed \nFinally, even if the Court finds that USDS is an agency under the FRA and that the \ndocuments requested are agency records, the Court should dismiss Defendants Musk and Davis. \nFor Plaintiff’s FRA claims, Defendants Musk and Davis should be dismissed because they \nare not agency heads. Under the FRA, only an agency head and the Archivist can be sued to compel \nan enforcement action against an agency. See 44 U.S.C. § 3106; see also CREW v. Pruitt, 319 F. \nSupp. 3d 252, 257 (D.D.C. 2018). Courts have stated that an “agency head” is the highest-ranking \nofficial at the agency. See AFGE, AFL-CIO, Local 1592 v. Fed. Labor Rels. Auth., 288 F.3d 1238, \n1241 (10th Cir. 2002) (holding that the Secretary of Defense was determined to be the Air Force \n“agency head” for service requirements). \nWhile Plaintiff asserts that Defendants Musk and Davis are “functional heads” of USDS, \nCompl. ¶¶ 17, 66, there is nothing more than hearsay news articles to back this information up, \nnone of which would give the Court a basis to deem either Musk or Davis to be the agency head. \nSee Democracy Forward Found., 474 F. Supp. 3d at 150 (rejecting hearsay in newspaper articles \nas inadmissible when offered by plaintiff asserting FRA violation); see also Metro. Council of \nNAACP Branches v. FCC, 46 F.3d 1154, 1165 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (“We seriously question whether \na New York Times article is admissible evidence of the truthfulness of its contents.”). The only \nother piece of information Plaintiff uses to support its proposition is a deposition where USDS \nstated that “Davis made decisions that ‘Gleason later ratified’” and that Davis reports to Gleason. \nCompl. ¶ 93. However, as reflected by Defendant Gleason’s declaration in the CREW FOIA case, \nCiv. A. No. 25-0511, ECF No. 24-2, she is the Acting Administrator of USDS. Thus, neither \nDefendant Musk nor Davis is an agency head, and they should be dismissed. \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 33 of 34\nSimilarly, Defendants Musk and Davis should also be dismissed from this case because \npeople are not subject to FOIA—only “agencies” are. See Martinez v. Bureau of Prisons, 444 F.3d \n620,  624  (D.C.  Cir.  2006)  (“[T]he  district  court  properly  dismissed  the  named  individual \ndefendants because no cause of action exists that would entitle appellant to relief from them under \n. . . FOIA.”; FOIA “concern[s] the obligations of agencies as distinct from individual employees \nin those agencies”); Competitive Enter., 643 F. Supp. 3d at 126 (“Needless to say, individuals are \nnot agencies.”); see also Sanders v. Dep’t of Just., No. 10-5273, 2011 WL 1769099, at *1 (D.C. \nCir. Apr. 21, 2011) (claims against individual defendants are not cognizable under FOIA); Isasi v. \nOffice of the Att’y Gen., 594 F. Supp. 2d 12, 14 (D.D.C. 2009) (dismissing claim against individual \ndefendant because “a Bivens action is not viable as a remedy for FOIA violations, and the FOIA \ndoes not permit claims against individual federal officers”), aff’d, No. 09-5122, 2010 WL 2574048 \n(D.C. Cir. June 2, 2010).  \nPlaintiff’s  decision  to  sue  Mr.  Musk  and  Ms.  Gleason  in  their  purported  “official” \ncapacities does not change the outcome. Competitive Enter., 643 F. Supp. 3d at 126–27 (suing a \nperson in an official capacity “does not morph an individual into an agency”). Claims against \nDefendants Musk and Davis arising out of FOIA should be dismissed pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(6) for this additional reason. \n \n*     *     * \n   \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 12-1     Filed 07/01/25     Page 34 of 34\nCONCLUSION \n  For the foregoing reasons, the Court should grant Defendants’ motion to dismiss and \ndismiss this case with prejudice. \nDated: July 1, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n     \nJEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nUnited States Attorney \n   \nBy:   /s/ Kaitlin K.

Rubio, and National Archives \nand  Records  Administration  (collectively,  the  “Defendants”),  by  and  through  undersigned \ncounsel, respectfully move to stay further proceedings until a final decision is rendered on whether \nUSDS  is  an  agency  subject  to  the  Freedom  of  Information  Act  (“FOIA”)  in  Citizens  for \nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington (“CREW”) v. U.S. DOGE Service, Civ. A. No. 25-0511 \n(CRC) (D.D.C.), on Pet. for Writ of Mandamus, No. 25-5130 (D.C. Cir.) (hereinafter, “the CREW \ncase”). Although the D.C. Circuit issued a ruling in the CREW case on July 14, 2025, regarding \nthe proper scope of discovery in that case, its decision is not yet final, and the Supreme Court \nordered the CREW case to remain stayed until any timely petition for certiorari is decided. U.S. \nDOGE Serv. v. Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash., 145 S. Ct. 1981, 1982 (2025) (Mem.). \nMeanwhile,  three  other  FOIA  cases  against  USDS  have  also  been  stayed  due  to  pending \nproceedings in CREW, and a stay is warranted here for the same reasons. Defendants’ responsive \npleading in this case is currently due August 5, 2025, and Defendants intend to move to dismiss, \namong other things, on the basis that USDS is not an agency within the meaning of FOIA. Thus, \na temporary stay of proceedings to await appellate guidance—and to await a final decision on the \nagency issue in the CREW case if a final decision on the mandamus petition does not itself resolve \nthe agency issue—would promote efficiency and conserve judicial and party resources. If this \nmotion is denied, Defendants respectfully request, in the alternative, that the Court allow an \nadditional fourteen days from its ruling on this motion for Defendants to move to dismiss. \nPursuant to Local Civil Rule 7(m), the parties have met and conferred through counsel. \nPlaintiff opposes a stay but does not oppose an additional fourteen days to respond to the Amended \nComplaint if the stay motion is denied. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 4 of 14\nBACKGROUND \nI.  The Legal Question of Whether USDS Is an “Agency” Under FOIA Is Now Pending \nBefore Multiple District Courts. \nTo date, plaintiffs in at least seven cases have brought claims pursuant to FOIA’s cause of \naction, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B), on the theory that USDS is an “agency” subject to FOIA. Six of \nthem are pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Chronologically, they \nare: (1) Ctr. for Bio. Diversity v. OMB, Civ. A. No. 25-0165 (BAH) (D.D.C. filed Jan. 20, 2025); \n(2) Am. Oversight v. U.S. Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, Civ. A. No. 25-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. filed \nFeb. 11, 2025); (3) CREW v. U.S. DOGE Serv., Civ. A. No. 25-0511 (CRC) (D.D.C. filed Feb. 20, \n2025); (4) MSW Media, Inc. v. USDS, Civ. A. No. 25-1933 (JEB) (D.D.C. filed Mar. 28, 2025); \n(5) Am. Oversight v. U.S. Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, Civ. A. No. 25-1251 (RC) (D.D.C. filed Apr. \n23, 2025); and (6) Project on Gov’t Oversight, Inc. (“POGO”) v. U.S. DOGE Serv., Civ. A. No. \n25-1295 (BAH) (D.D.C. filed Apr. 28, 2025).1 In addition to the present suit, another case pending \nin this District raises the same issue in the context of the Federal Records Act (“FRA”). See POGO \nv. Trump, Civ. A. No. 25-0527 (JEB) (D.D.C. filed Feb. 21, 2025) (“POGO FRA case”). \nII.  Relevant Past and Future Proceedings in the D.C. Circuit and United States Supreme \nCourt in the CREW case. \nAs referenced above, prior and future proceedings in the CREW case—where the scope of \nany discovery and how courts should analyze the issue of USDS’s agency status will be fleshed \nout further over the next weeks or months—warrant a stay. A brief overview of the proceedings in \nthat case helps illustrate why. \nAs relevant here, the CREW case began when CREW sent an expedited FOIA request to \nUSDS, which USDS denied on the grounds that it is not an agency subject to FOIA. See 769 F. \n \n1   There is a seventh case in the Southern District of New York: The Intercept Media, Inc. v. \nUSDS, Civ. A. No. 25-2404 (S.D.N.Y. filed Mar. 24, 2025). \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 5 of 14\nSupp. 3d 8, 16 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025). CREW sought a preliminary injunction directing USDS to \nprocess the FOIA request by March 10, 2025. Id. at 17. The District Court denied CREW’s request \nfor a March 10, 2025, production deadline, but nonetheless ordered “expedited processing” of the \nFOIA request. Id. at 18. In doing so, the Court held that “CREW has established a likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of its argument that USDS is subject to FOIA.” Id. at 18, 23–26. Because its \nagency status under FOIA had not been fully briefed or argued, USDS filed a motion for summary \njudgment on this issue. Civ. A. No. 25-0511, ECF No. 24 (D.D.C. filed Mar. 19, 2025). \nCREW,  in  turn,  sought  extensive,  expedited  discovery  concerning  USDS,  including \ndepositions, interrogatories, requests for admission, and requests for production. Civ. A. No. 25-\n0511, ECF No. 27 (D.D.C. filed Mar. 27, 2025). USDS objected that discovery was unwarranted \nbecause “[USDS’s] charter documents demonstrate that it does not have” legal authority sufficient \nto make it an agency under FOIA. Id., ECF No. 34 (D.D.C. filed Apr. 8, 2025). Defending its \nrequests, CREW contended that USDS has “influence” over the entire Executive Branch and that \ndiscovery was necessary “to ascertain how DOGE is actually influencing agency action.” Id., ECF \nNo. 35 at 3, 6 (Apr. 10, 2025). The District Court granted CREW’s motion in substantial part. 349 \nF.R.D. 1 (D.D.C. Apr. 15, 2025). Of note, the District Court accepted CREW’s central contention \nthat FOIA status depends on the extent of an entity’s “influence” within the Executive Branch. \nE.g., id. at 8 (“If Agency DOGE teams are complying with orders from USDS leadership, that \nspeaks to USDS’s influence over other federal agencies.”); id. at 9 (calling key question “whether \nUSDS employees are using that access [to federal agencies] to influence those agencies”). \nAfter the D.C. Circuit denied USDS’s petition for writ of mandamus, USDS sought relief \nfrom the Supreme Court, which granted the Government’s application on June 6, 2025. U.S. \nDOGE Serv. 145 S. Ct. at 1981–82. The Supreme Court held that “[t]he portions of the District \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 6 of 14\nCourt’s April 15 discovery order that require the Government to disclose the content of intra-\nExecutive Branch USDS recommendations and whether those recommendations were followed is \nnot appropriately tailored.” Id. at 1982. Because an Executive Branch entity’s status under FOIA \nturns on its formal legal authority, it held that “[a]ny inquiry into whether an entity is an agency \nfor the purposes of [FOIA] cannot turn on the entity’s ability to persuade.” Id. “Furthermore,” it \nheld, “separation of powers concerns counsel judicial deference and restraint in the context of \ndiscovery  regarding  internal  Executive  Branch  communications.”  Id.  The  Supreme  Court \nremanded to the D.C. Circuit, directing the Court of Appeals to “take appropriate action to narrow \nthe April 15 discovery order consistent with this order.” Id. The District Court’s April 15 order \ngranting CREW’s motion for discovery is stayed “pending remanded consideration at the Court of \nAppeals, and disposition of the petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought.” Id. \nAfter the Supreme Court’s remand, CREW filed a motion for summary disposition in the \nD.C. Circuit, proposing to abandon seven of its discovery requests but otherwise asking the D.C. \nCircuit to allow the remaining discovery to go forward. See In re U.S. DOGE Serv., No. 25-5130, \nDkt. 2121424 (D.C. Cir. filed June 18, 2025). The Government opposed CREW’s motion, arguing \nthat “to the extent any discovery is appropriate at all, it must be exceedingly limited”; that is, \n“[s]ince  the  relevant  legal  question  turns  entirely  on  formal  legal  authority,  discovery  and \ndepositions are simply not necessary to determine whether USDS wields substantial authority \nindependent of USCA.” Id., Dkt. 2122282, at 3, 9–10 (D.C. Cir. filed June 25, 2025). On July 14, \n2025, the D.C. Circuit issued an order granting in part and denying in part the government’s \nmandamus petition. Id., Order, Dkt. 2125341 (D.C. Cir. July 14, 2025). In particular, the D.C. \nCircuit directed the District Court to exclude certain interrogatories and requests for admission but \ndeemed the remaining discovery permissible. Id. Pursuant to the Supreme Court’s prior order, \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 7 of 14\nDistrict Court proceedings in the CREW FOIA case will remain stayed pending any petition for a \nwrit of certiorari, which will be due within 90 days of the D.C. Circuit’s Order, namely, on or \nbefore October 13, 2025.2 \nThus, the scope of discovery (if any) concerning whether USDS is an agency subject to \nFOIA remains pending in the CREW case, and the D.C. Circuit final determination on that issue \nwill bind this Court. In light of these pending proceedings in the CREW case, as of this filing, three \nof the other five FOIA cases in this District listed above have been stayed. On July 10, 2025, the \nCourt in Center for Biological Diversity granted a stay as to USDS defendants “until a final \ndecision is rendered” in the CREW case, regarding whether USDS is an agency subject to FOIA. \nSee July 10, 2025, Order, ECF No. 26, Ctr. for Bio. Diversity, Civ. A. No. 25-0165 (BAH). On \nJuly 14, 2025, the Court in MSW Media granted a stay “until a final decision is rendered” in the \nCREW case “on the Government’s challenge to the plaintiff’s attempts to obtain discovery.” See \nJuly 14, 2025, Order, ECF No. 41, MSW Media, Civ. A. No. 25-1933 (JEB). On July 18, 2025, the \nCourt in Project on Government Oversight granted a stay “until a final decision is rendered on \nwhether defendant is an agency subject to FOIA” in the CREW case. See July 18, 2025, Minute \nOrder, Project on Gov’t Oversight, Civ. A. No. 25-1295 (BAH) (D.D.C.). Likewise, the other case \nin this district regarding whether USDS is subject to the FRA, POGO v. Trump, likewise is stayed \npending a final decision in CREW. See July 21, 2025, Minute Order, Civ. A. No. 25-0527 (JEB) \n(D.D.C. filed Feb. 21, 2025). \n \n2   On July 15, 2025, the District Court in CREW issued a minute order modifying prior \ndiscovery orders in accord with the D.C. Circuit’s July 14, 2025 Order and purporting to set \ndeadlines for the government’s responses. See CREW, Minute Order of July 15, 2025. On July 16, \n2025, the parties in CREW filed a joint motion to modify the July 15 minute order in conformity \nwith the Supreme Court’s stay order. See id., Jt. Mot to Modify, ECF No. 48 (proposing to modify \nthe District Court’s order to state that its discovery schedule “shall remain stayed pending \ndisposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari, if such writ is timely sought”). \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 8 of 14\nIII.  Relevance to this Case \nPlaintiff initiated this suit to challenge Defendants’ “failures to meet their obligations under \nthe FRA and FOIA.” Compl., ECF No. 1 ¶ 5. Plaintiff’s complaint is predicated on the assertion \nthat USDS is an “agency” within the meaning of (and subject to) the FRA and FOIA. Id. ¶ 1. On \nJuly 1, 2025, Defendants moved to dismiss. ECF No. 12. On July 22, 2025, Plaintiff filed an \nAmended Complaint, which is likewise predicated on Defendants’ alleged “failures to meet their \nobligations under the FRA and FOIA.” Am. Compl., ECF No. 14 ¶ 5. Defendants intend to again \nmove to dismiss on grounds, among other things, that USDS is not an “agency” within the meaning \nof FOIA and the FRA. Though Defendants have not filed their motion to dismiss yet, Plaintiffs in \nthe other USDS cases have moved for discovery on the issue of whether USDS is an “agency” in \nresponse to similar dispositive motions filed by USDS in those cases. See, e.g., CREW, Civ. A. \nNo. 25-0511, ECF 27 (Mar. 27, 2025). Indeed, Plaintiff in this matter filed for discovery after \nUSDS filed an Amended Answer in another case. See Am. Oversight, Civ. A. No. 25-0409 (BAH), \nECF No. 21. That motion is ripe as of July 23, 2025, and remains pending. However, the outcome \nof the CREW case will be relevant and controlling regardless of whether Plaintiff decides to initiate \ndiscovery in this matter. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to \ncontrol the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for \ncounsel, and for litigants.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. 248, 254 (1936); see also Belize Soc. \nDev. Ltd. v. Gov’t of Belize, 668 F.3d 724, 731 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (holding that Landis governs when \na stay is issued “pursuant to the district court’s inherent authority in the interest of judicial \neconomy”). “How this can best be done calls for the exercise of judgment, which must weigh \ncompeting interests and maintain an even balance.” Landis, 299 U.S. at 254–55. A court’s \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 9 of 14\njudgment to stay “may be appropriately exercised where a separate proceeding bearing upon the \ncase is pending.” Hulley Enters. Ltd. v. Russian Fed’n, 211 F. Supp. 3d 269, 276 (D.D.C. 2016). \n“This rule applies whether the separate proceedings are judicial, administrative, or arbitral in \ncharacter, and does not require that the issues in such proceedings are necessarily controlling of \nthe action before the court.” Id. Rather, a stay may be warranted where the resolution of other \nlitigation will likely “narrow the issues in the pending cases and assist in the determination of the \nquestions of law involved.” Landis, 299 U.S. at 253; see also Leyva v. Certified Grocers of Cal., \nLtd., 593 F.2d 857, 863–64 (9th Cir. 1979) (“A trial court may, with propriety, find it is efficient \nfor its own docket and the fairest course for the parties to enter a stay of an action before it, pending \nresolution of independent proceedings which bear upon the case”). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Courts in This Circuit Routinely Stay Proceedings to Await Appellate Guidance. \nConsistent with their discretionary power, judges in this District have routinely stayed \nproceedings to promote judicial economy and efficiency where the D.C. Circuit’s ruling in the \nsame or a related matter will bear on further proceedings before the District Court. See, e.g., Ready \nto Win v. FEC, Civ. A. No. 22-3282 (RDM), 2023 WL 10512144, at *2 (D.D.C. July 28, 2023) \n(staying proceedings pending appeal of a related case, reasoning that discovery “may prove \nunnecessary or may be narrowed in light of the D.C. Circuit’s decision”); Blumenthal v. Trump, \nCiv. A. No. 17-1154 (EGS), 2019 WL 3948478, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 21, 2019) (“The Court will \nalso stay proceedings in this case pending the interlocutory appeal.”); Philipp v. Fed. Republic of \nGermany, 253 F. Supp. 3d 84, 89 (D.D.C. 2017) (“[T]he Court concludes that it is appropriate to \nstay the proceedings while Defendants’ interlocutory appeal is pending” and “shall not require \nDefendants to respond to the complaint and the parties to proceed with discovery at this time.”); \nUniv. of Colo. Health Mem’l Hosp. v. Burwell, Civ. A. No. 14-1220 (RC) 2017 WL 535246, at \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 10 of 14\n*12 (D.D.C. Feb. 9, 2017) (“Because many of the applicable issues may be resolved by the D.C. \nCircuit, and because the D.C. Circuit may otherwise provide instruction on the issues here, the \nCourt finds a stay would serve the interests of judicial efficiency.”); Allina Health Servs. v. \nSebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d 61, 71 (D.D.C. 2010) (finding “good cause to stay this matter” given \nthat “the parties agree that the resolution of [a related case] by the D.C. Circuit will be dispositive \nof the Plaintiffs’ arguments here”). \nCourts in other jurisdictions have stayed proceedings in similar circumstances. See, e.g., \nMinn. Voters Alliance v. Walz, 494 F. Supp. 3d 610, 611–12 (D. Minn. 2020) (staying proceedings \npending appeal of preliminary injunction because, among other things, the appeal was “likely to \nresolve some of the legal issues in dispute”); Fowler-Bey v. Johnson, Civ. A. No. 18-1235, 2018 \nWL 11476084, at *1–2 (D. Md. Nov. 30, 2018) (staying case where a “central issue” affecting \nplaintiff’s claim was pending before the Fourth Circuit); Dawoudi v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, Civ. \nA. No. 19-3783, 2016 WL 8711604, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 16, 2016) (“Because a decision in the \npending appeals would potentially be entirely dispositive of this case and, at a minimum, simplify \nthe issues for the parties and the Court, the stay . . . is warranted in this case.”); Carroll v. Wilson \nMcColl & Rasmussen, Att’ys at L., Civ. A. No. 08-0022, 2009 WL 315610, at *2 (D. Idaho Feb. \n9, 2009) (staying case to avoid “the expenditure of unnecessary costs, expenses, and time” where \nappellate court’s resolution of an issue would impact plaintiff's claims); Beltronics USA, Inc. v. \nMidwest Inventory Distrib., LLC, 545 F. Supp. 2d 1188, 1190 (D. Kan. 2008) (staying proceedings \npending appeal of preliminary injunction to await appellate court’s resolution of a legal issue that \n“would significantly advance the course of th[e] litigation” and best serve “the time and effort of \nthe parties and the court”); Bray v. QFA Royalties, LLC, Civ. A. No. 06-2528, 2007 WL 2688858, \nat *1 (D. Colo. Sept. 12, 2007) (staying proceedings pending appeal of preliminary injunction \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 11 of 14\nbecause appellate court’s “determination of the legal issues inherent in [the] preliminary injunction \ndecision will edify further proceedings on those same . . . claims for permanent injunctive relief”). \nII.  A Stay of Proceedings Will Promote Judicial Economy and Conserve the Parties’ \nResources in This Case. \n“In deciding whether to grant a stay, courts generally ‘weigh competing interests and \nmaintain an even balance between the court’s interests in judicial economy and any possible \nhardship to the parties.’” Masdar Solar & Wind Cooperatief U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain, 397 F. \nSupp. 3d 34, 39 (D.D.C. 2019) (quoting Belize Soc., 668 F.3d at 732–33). Here, a temporary stay \nof District Court proceedings until a final decision is rendered in CREW on the central issue of \nwhether a USDS is an agency subject to the FOIA and the FRA (including all appeals of any such \ndecision) would serve the interests of judicial economy and efficiency and conserve the parties’ \nresources. At the very least, proceedings in this case should be stayed until the D.C. Circuit’s \ndecision on remand from the Supreme Court becomes final, or until the Supreme Court disposes \nof any timely petition for writ of certiorari. In either event, a stay pending further proceedings in \nCREW may narrow the issues before the Court in this case and the scope of any discovery. \nIn the CREW case, proceedings thus far have demonstrated that questions regarding the \nappropriate scope of discovery, if any, are intertwined with the underlying legal framework \ngoverning what makes an entity an agency under FOIA. For example, the Supreme Court has \nalready held that a component’s agency status cannot turn on its ability to persuade. See USDS v. \nCREW, 145 S. Ct. at 1982. The D.C. Circuit, in turn, applied that principle to the plaintiff’s pending \ndiscovery requests in that case, but its decision is not yet final, and the CREW District Court case \nremains stayed. Further appellate guidance on these issues, as well as further proceedings in CREW \non USDS’s agency status, including appellate review, are highly likely to affect this Court’s \nresolution of USDS’s agency status in any further proceedings in this case. \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 12 of 14\nBy contrast, requiring Defendants to continue to defend this action in District Court without \nwaiting for appellate resolution of the issues raised here would be a wasteful and inefficient \nexercise for both Defendants and the Court, particularly since there is a significant likelihood that \nany analysis the Court might provide in the interim would be superseded at least in part by D.C. \nCircuit and/or Supreme Court decisions. See, e.g., Whitman-Walker Clinic, Inc. v. Dep’t of Health \n& Hum. Servs., Civ. A. No. 20-1630 (JEB), 2021 WL 4033072, at *3 (D.D.C. Sept. 3, 2021) (“In \nthe interim, a substantial amount of the parties’ and the Court’s resources would have been \nexpended and potentially for little gain.”); cf. Freedom Watch, Inc. v. Dep’t of State, 925 F. Supp. \n2d 55, 59 (D.D.C. 2013) (granting a stay based on “[n]ot needing more lawyers to spend more time \non more briefs on more subjects”). \nA stay of proceedings will also not prejudice Plaintiff. Ultimately, Plaintiff seeks the \nrelease of records responsive to its FOIA request, but for the reasons explained, a stay is unlikely \nto delay a final decision regarding its request. To the contrary, the determination of USDS’s agency \nstatus is a necessary prerequisite to any further proceedings regarding Plaintiff’s FOIA request, \nand waiting for that issue to be decided in CREW will conserve Plaintiff’s resources as well as the \nCourt’s. Nor can Plaintiff show any other prejudice. The Court in the POGO FRA case—where \nUSDS’s agency status likewise is the central issue—already denied Plaintiff’s request for a \npreliminary injunction on the ground that, regardless of whether USDS qualifies as an agency \nsubject to FOIA and the FRA, or an entity that is instead subject to the Presidential Records Act, \nPlaintiff faces no “threat of destruction” because “Defendants have given the Court ample reasons \nto  believe  that  they  are  complying  with  the  PRA,  and  Plaintiff  has  not  refuted  those \nrepresentations.” ECF No. 23, Mem. Op. at 7, 10 (D.D.C. June 17, 2025), POGO v. Trump, Civ. \nA. No. 25-0527 (JEB). \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 15     Filed 08/05/25     Page 13 of 14\nThus, a temporary stay until USDS’s agency status is resolved in the CREW case is \nwarranted. At the very least, the Court should grant a stay until a final decision in In re U.S. Doge \nService on the discovery issue. \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court stay further proceedings \nagainst USDS. \nDated: August 5, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nJEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nUnited States Attorney \n   \nBy:  /s/ Kaitlin K.

They do not put a plaintiff’s lawsuit on hold \nsimply because a different plaintiff is litigating a similar issue against the same defendant in \nanother  case. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that principle  across multiple \ndoctrinal areas. See, e.g., Sprint Comms., Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, 72 (2013) (a federal court \nshould not abstain “simply because a pending state-court proceeding involves the same subject \nmatter”); Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 884–85 (2008) (rejecting defendants’ claim that a \njudgment against one plaintiff binds another, unrelated plaintiff raising a similar issue in another \ncase);  Colo.  River  Water  Conservation  Dist.  v.  United  States,  424  U.S.  800,  817  (1976) \n(highlighting “the virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts to exercise the jurisdiction \ngiven them”). And when (as here) defendants seek to stay proceedings in one case pending \nresolution of separate litigation by another, unrelated plaintiff, the Court has emphasized that \n“[o]nly in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant \nin another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.” Landis v. N. Am. Co., 299 U.S. \n248, 255 (1936). \n  The fact that the defendants are part of the U.S. government does not change this principle. \nEvery day, in federal courts across the country, unrelated plaintiffs sue the federal government on \nlegal claims that may share legal or factual issues. Conflicting decisions may be resolved on \nappeal, but if the rule were that all litigation must wait for resolution of any other litigation raising \nsimilar issues, the business of the federal courts would grind to a halt. Indeed, just this Term the \nU.S. Supreme Court held that—outside of class actions or other special circumstances—when a \nplaintiff seeks an injunction against the federal government, it sues only for itself. See Trump v. \nCASA, Inc., 145 S. Ct. 2540, 2548 & n.1 (2025). If unrelated plaintiffs cannot obtain relief for each \nother, then it makes no sense to force their cases to wait for each other.  \n  1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 8 of 27\nHere,  in  the  wake  of  sweeping  changes  the  Department  of  Government  Efficiency \n(“DOGE”) made across the executive branch, Defendants seek an indefinite, and potentially years-\nlong, stay of American Oversight’s case—a stay that will prevent transparency into the destruction \nDOGE has wrought. Their motion to stay all proceedings in this case “until a final decision is \nrendered on whether [DOGE] is an agency subject to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)” in \nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. U.S. DOGE Service, No. 25-cv-511 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025) [hereinafter CREW] should be denied for three reasons. Defs.’ Mot. Stay \nProceedings & Mem. Supp., ECF No. 15, at iii, [hereinafter “Defs.’ Mot.”]. First, courts strongly \ndisfavor requests for a stay based on proceedings between parties in different litigations, and \nDefendants have not met their heavy burden to show any compelling need for such extraordinary \nrelief, nor the requisite “clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to move forward . . . .” \nLandis, 299 U.S. at 255. Second, American Oversight would suffer significant harm from a stay \ndue to (1) deprivation of its right to litigate its own case; (2) the requested stay’s improperly \nindefinite duration; (3) delay of an adjudication on the merits of its Freedom of Information Act \n(“FOIA”) claims that will indefinitely postpone receipt of records responsive to those requests; \nand (4) ongoing deficiencies in Defendants’ recordkeeping policies and practices at the heart of \nthis lawsuit, leading to a risk of irrevocable destruction of public records. Third, judicial economy \nis not served by a stay because the issue of DOGE’s agency status is not now before this Court, \nnor is it currently pending before any court in CREW.  \nDefendants’ motion should be denied and the Court should order Defendants to respond to \nthe Amended Complaint within fourteen (14) days. \nBACKGROUND \nSince January 20, 2025, the Department of Government Efficiency and its components the \nU.S. DOGE Service and U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization (collectively, “DOGE”) \n  2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 9 of 27\nhave operated in secrecy and at breakneck speed to overhaul agencies across the Executive \nBranch—dismantling  entire  agencies,  canceling  previously  approved  grants  and  contracts, \noverruling instructions from Senate-confirmed Cabinet members, directing the termination of tens \nof thousands of federal employees, and more. Am. Compl., ECF No. 14, ¶¶ 1–2, 58–59, 123–158.  \nMeanwhile, DOGE has obfuscated even the most basic information about its internal operations, \nincluding the identity of the person or people directing its actions, id. ¶¶ 66–103, and its staff and \nofficials have used nongovernmental, ephemeral messaging platforms like Signal and electronic \ndocument collaboration platforms like Google Docs—applications that lack the effective controls \nor safeguards necessary to ensure that public records are maintained as required under the Federal \nRecords Act (“FRA”)—to communicate about official government matters. Id. ¶¶ 3–4, 180–221.  \nIn response to media reporting that DOGE staff were using ephemeral messaging systems \nin its operations to conduct government business, American Oversight sent a letter to Elon Musk \nas DOGE’s leader, the National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”), and other \nagencies, warning them of the likely unlawful destruction or removal of federal records protected \nby the FRA. Id. ¶ 230. Neither Musk nor anyone else from DOGE responded, but NARA’s Chief \nRecords Officer replied to assert only that “[t]he issues raised in your letter are now before the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia Circuit, see CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service, \n1:25-cv-00511. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is a party to that \nlitigation, and will work closely with the Department of Justice to respond appropriately through \nthat process.” Id. ¶¶ 231–32. \nAmerican Oversight has submitted more than 40 FOIA requests to DOGE since January 20, \n2025, five of which are at issue in this case. See id. ¶ 242. These requests were submitted between \nFebruary 24, 2025, and June 17, 2025, and seek records regarding, inter alia: DOGE’s involvement \n  3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 10 of 27\nwith the dismantling or attempted dismantling of multiple federal agencies, id. ¶¶ 247–50; USDS \nAdministrator Amy Gleason’s communications, id. ¶¶ 251–54; DOGE’s directives to agencies \nregarding how to respond to requests for oversight, id. ¶¶ 255–56; DOGE’s involvement with the \nfiring of probationary employees at agencies across the executive branch, id. ¶¶ 257–58; and \nformer USDS official Steve Davis’s communications and Signal messages relaying instructions to \nagency DOGE teams, id. ¶¶ 259–60. In response to four of the FOIA requests at issue in this \nlawsuit, DOGE denied that it is an agency subject to FOIA and the FRA. Id. ¶ 249. DOGE has \nneither acknowledged nor responded to the fifth request. Id. ¶ 260. \nAmerican Oversight filed its original complaint in this matter on April 23, 2025, alleging \nviolations of both FOIA and the FRA. See generally Compl., ECF No. 1. It filed an Amended \nComplaint on July 22, 2025, ECF No. 14, adding factual allegations and additional claims under \nthe FRA. In lieu of filing a responsive pleading on their deadline to respond to the Amended \nComplaint, Defendants filed this motion to stay proceedings, ECF No. 15. \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Although a federal district court “has broad discretion to stay proceedings as an incident to \nits power to control its own docket,” Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 706 (1997), it “must weigh \ncompeting interests and maintain an even balance between the court’s interests in judicial economy \nand any possible hardship to the parties,” Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd. v. Gov’t of Belize, 668 F.3d 724, \n727, 732–33 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (citation modified) (reversing stay as exceeding district court’s \ndiscretion and quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 254–55). Although courts routinely stay proceedings \npending interlocutory appeals in the same case, “it is well established that a stay pending the \nresolution of unrelated legal proceedings is an extraordinary remedy.” Nat’l Indus. for Blind v. \nDep’t of Veterans Affs., 296 F. Supp. 3d 131, 137 (D.D.C. 2017) (denying stay) (emphasis added). \n“Only in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant \n  4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 11 of 27\nin another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.” Landis, 299 U.S. at 255. In \naddition, a stay is “immoderate and hence unlawful” if it is “to continue by its terms for an \nimmoderate stretch of time . . . .” Id. at 257. \n  Finally, “the party seeking a stay bears the burden of showing that the stay is needed and \nwarranted,” and if there is “even a fair possibility” that the nonmovant would be “adversely \naffect[ed]” by a stay, “the movant . . . must demonstrate a ‘clear case of hardship or inequity in \nbeing required to go forward.’”  Nat’l Indus. for Blind, 296 F. Supp. 3d at 137–38 (quoting Landis, \n299 U.S. at 255); see also Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Ross, 419 F. Supp. 3d 16, 20 (D.D.C. \n2019) (“[I]f it determines that there is a fair possibility that the stay will work damage to Plaintiffs’ \ninterests, [the movant]’s burden becomes even heavier, for it must then show a clear case of \nhardship or inequity in being required to go forward.” (citation modified)). \nARGUMENT \nI.  COURTS STRONGLY DISFAVOR AND ROUTINELY DENY STAYS BASED \nON PROCEEDINGS IN A SEPARATE, UNRELATED CASE, LIKE THE ONE \nDEFENDANTS SEEK HERE.   \nDefendants ignore nearly a century of Circuit and Supreme Court precedent restricting and \nrejecting stays based on proceedings between unrelated parties. As the Supreme Court explained \nnearly 90 years ago, “[o]nly in rare circumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand \naside while a litigant in another settles the rule of law that will define the rights of both.” Landis, \n299 U.S. at 255. “The default . . . is for the litigation to continue as usual, and ‘the burden of \nmaking out the justice and wisdom of a departure from the beaten track lay[s] heavily on the’ \nmovants.” OCA - Asian Pac. Am. Advocs. v. Rubio, No. CV 25-287 (TJK), 2025 WL 1393153, at \n*1 (D.D.C. May 14, 2025) (denying stay and quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 256).  \n  5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 12 of 27\nDefendants do not cite a single case from this Circuit where a matter was stayed over the \nobjection of a litigant pending resolution of some other case involving an unrelated party.1 \nFirst, most of the cases from this District on which Defendants rely involve stays pending \ninterlocutory appeals in the same case, between the same parties. See Defs.’ Mot. at 7–8; see also \nReady to Win v. Fed. Election Comm’n, No. CV 22-3282 (RDM), 2023 WL 10512144, at *2 \n(D.D.C. July 28, 2023) (granting stay pending interlocutory appeal of order on preliminary \ninjunction); Blumenthal v. Trump, No. CV 17-1154 (EGS), 2019 WL 3948478, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. \n21, 2019) (granting stay pending interlocutory appeal of denial of motion to dismiss); Philipp v. \nFed. Republic of Germany, 253 F. Supp. 3d 84, 86 (D.D.C. 2017) (granting stay pending \ninterlocutory appeal of motion to dismiss). But those cases are irrelevant. There, no litigant was \ndeprived of its right to advance its own legal interests; rather, the question was merely whether \ncertain aspects of the litigation should pause while others continue. \n \n1 Indeed, even the out-of-circuit cases cited by Defendants are of no help to them. Most involve \nstays pending appeals between the same litigants. See, e.g., Minnesota Voters All. v. Walz, 494 F. \nSupp. 3d 610, 611 (D. Minn. 2020) (granting stay pending interlocutory appeal); Carroll v. Wilson \nMcColl & Rasmussen, Att’ys at L., No. CV 08-22-CWD, 2009 WL 315610, at *1 (D. Idaho Feb. \n9, 2009) (granting stay pending appeal to Idaho Supreme Court in related litigation between same \nparties); Beltronics USA, Inc. v. Midwest Inventory Distribution LLC, 545 F. Supp. 2d 1188, 1189 \n(D. Kan. 2008) (granting stay pending interlocutory appeal); Bray v. QFA Royalties, LLC, No. 06-\nCV-02528-JLK, 2007 WL 2688858, at *1 (D. Colo. Sept. 12, 2007) (granting stay pending \ninterlocutory appeal). \n \nThe only two cases Defendants cite involving stays based on different proceedings are inapposite \nhere. In Dawoudi v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC, No. 16-CV-2356, 2016 WL 8711604, at *2 (N.D. Ill. \nSept. 16, 2016), plaintiffs sought a stay because, unlike here, the “central issue being considered” \nin a pending consolidated appeal was identical to their claims; the court granted the stay because \ndefendant/nonmovant  showed  no  hardship  and  resolution  by  the  circuit  could  be  “entirely \ndispositive” and would save the parties’ and court’s resources. In Fowler-Bey v. Johnson, No. CV \nPX-18-1235, 2018 WL 11476084, at *2 (D. Md. Nov. 30, 2018), the court considered a pro se \nhabeas petition, where a central question of statutory interpretation controlling whether the claim \nwas time-barred was already pending in the Fourth Circuit in different proceedings; the court thus \nstayed proceedings sua sponte to allow resolution of the question by the circuit. \n  6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 13 of 27\nSecond, the only cases Defendants cite involving a stay based on proceedings between \ndifferent parties involved consent requests for a stay, where all parties agreed that a stay pending \nappellate resolution of a related case was in their interests and appellate resolution was imminent. \nSee Allina Health Servs. v. Sebelius, 756 F. Supp. 2d 61, 71 (D.D.C. 2010) (consent request for \nstay pending case set for argument in D.C. Circuit and decision anticipated within three months \nand which parties agreed would likely be dispositive of case); Univ. of Colorado Health at Mem’l \nHosp. v. Burwell, 233 F. Supp. 3d 69, 87 (D.D.C. 2017) (consent request for stay by the plaintiff \nwas appropriate because cases pending in D.C. Circuit would have “preclusive effect”). Again, \nthat scenario is inapposite—where both parties agree to a stay pending resolution of a core legal \nissue, no party is deprived of its right to advance its interests. Similarly, the stays in the four other \nFOIA and FRA cases against DOGE were unopposed. See Minute Order, Cntr. for Biological \nDiversity v. Office of Management and Budget, No. 25-cv-165 (D.D.C. July 10, 2025) (ECF No. \n26) (granting consent order for partial stay); Order, MSW Media v. U.S. DOGE Service, No. 25-\ncv-1933 (D.D.C. July 14, 2025) (ECF No. 41) (same); Response to Mot. to Stay, Project on Gov’t \nOversight v. Trump, No. 25-cv-527 (D.D.C. July 18, 2025) (ECF No. 26) (plaintiff agreeing to \ngovernment’s requested stay); Minute Order, Project on Gov’t Oversight v. U.S. DOGE Service, \nNo. 25-cv-1295 (D.D.C. July 18, 2025) (granting unopposed motion for stay). The plaintiffs in \nthose cases, like the plaintiff in this case, have the right to litigate their cases as they choose. Their \ndecisions to consent to a stay have no bearing on this Court’s consideration of the present motion. \nII.  A  STAY  WILL  SIGNIFICANTLY  HARM AMERICAN  OVERSIGHT,  BUT \nDEFENDANTS WILL SUFFER NO HARDSHIP IF THE CASE PROCEEDS.   \nDefendants must show that American Oversight does not risk a “fair possibility” of harm \nfrom a stay, and that Defendants themselves will suffer hardship absent a stay. See Nat’l Indus. for \nBlind, 296 F. Supp. 3d at 137–38. They cannot make a showing on either ground, and thus on each \n  7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 14 of 27\nground independently, their motion should be denied. See Defs.’ Mot. at 6–10 (addressing only \njudicial economy and not hardship to the parties). Defendants’ entire argument boils down to one \nassertion: that “judges in this District have routinely stayed proceedings to promote judicial \neconomy and efficiency where the D.C. Circuit’s ruling in the same or a related matter will bear \non further proceedings before the District Court.” Defs.’ Mot. at 7. But in so arguing, Defendants \nmisapprehend the standard that governs this motion and fail to demonstrate that without a stay, \nthey will suffer hardship or inequity. See Landis, 299 U.S. at 255; Clinton, 520 U.S. at 706. They \nhave thus failed to carry their burden and their motion should be denied.  \nIn deciding whether the movant has met its heavy burden in moving for a stay, the Court \nmust balance three factors: “(1) harm to the nonmoving party if a stay does issue; (2) the moving \nparty’s need for a stay—that is, the harm to the moving party if a stay does not issue; and (3) \nwhether a stay would promote efficient use of the [C]ourt’s resources.”  Ctr. for Biological \nDiversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 20. Defendants’ motion fails as to all three.  \nA.  American Oversight Will Suffer Significant Harm. \n  In deciding whether to grant a stay, courts first consider “‘the injury to the party being \nstayed.’” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 20 (quoting Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd., 668 \nF.3d at 732). If, as here, there is even a “fair possibility” that the nonmovant would be harmed, the \nmovant must then show “‘a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward.’” \nCtr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 20 (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. at 255). Importantly, \nthe party opposing a stay motion need not show that it will “necessarily suffer” harm, because the \n“burden of demonstrating a hardship that warrants staying properly filed legal proceedings is on \nthe movant . . . .” Nat’l Indus. for Blind v. Dep’t of Veterans Affs., 296 F. Supp. 3d 131, 140 (D.D.C. \n2017) (emphasis in original). \n  8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 15 of 27\n  A stay would harm American Oversight in several ways. The government seeks what \namounts to an indefinite stay, because the merits question of DOGE’s agency status (as opposed \nto the propriety of CREW’s discovery requests) is not pending in any court in CREW and could \ntake years to resolve in that litigation. Such a stay harms American Oversight by (1) denying \nAmerican Oversight the right to litigate its case as it sees fit; (2) seeking an improperly indefinite \nstay; (3) delaying the ultimate resolution of this case and American Oversight’s receipt of records \nresponsive to its FOIA requests at issue; and (4) allowing Defendants’ ongoing destruction of \nfederal records due to inadequate recordkeeping policies and practices, in violation of the FRA. \nAs alleged in the Amended Complaint, those records go to the heart of one of the biggest agency-\ncreated crises in American government to date. See generally Am. Compl. Any further delay—\nmuch less the indefinite one proposed by Defendants—harms American Oversight and the public \nit serves by depriving them of access to the requested records and risking continued destruction \nand removal of federal records that may shed light on the government’s role in creating that crisis.  \n1.  A Stay Improperly Denies American Oversight the Right to Litigate Its Case \n  American Oversight has a right to litigate its own case, in its own way, to determine its \nrights, and courts have long recognized that depriving a party of this right by staying proceedings \nmust be the “rare” exception. Landis, 299 U.S. at 255; Belize Soc. Dev. Ltd., 668 F.3d at 732. Here, \nthat means American Oversight should have the right to determine (based on whatever responsive \npleading the defendants file) whether to serve its own discovery requests, which would differ from \nCREW’s,  to  litigate  the  merits  question  of  whether  DOGE  exercises  substantial  authority \nindependent of the President in its own way, using its own evidence, and make case strategy \ndecisions so that American Oversight can “settle[] the rule of law that will define” its rights. See \nLandis, 299 U.S. at 255. Only where the movant has carried its heavy burden to demonstrate a \n  9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 16 of 27\n“clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward” is a stay proper, and Defendants \nhere have failed to do so. See id. \n2.   Defendants Improperly Seek an Indefinite Stay That Harms American Oversight \nA summary of the proceedings in CREW reveals the unreasonableness of the grounds \nasserted by Defendants’ motion and the indefinite nature of the stay they seek. In the district court, \nfollowing DOGE’s motion for summary judgment on the sole grounds that DOGE is not an agency \nsubject to FOIA and the FRA, CREW filed a motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n56(d) for expedited discovery to ascertain facts necessary to determine whether DOGE wields \nsubstantial authority independent of the President. Mot. to Expedite Disc., CREW v. U.S. DOGE \nServ., No. 25-cv-511 (D.D.C. March 27, 2025) (ECF No. 27). The district court granted that \nmotion, Min. Order (D.D.C. Apr. 2, 2025), and Defendants sought a writ of mandamus from the \nCourt of Appeals to halt the district court’s order, 349 F.R.D. 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2025); In re U.S. DOGE \nServ., No. 25-5130, 2025 WL 1393222, at *1 (D.C. Cir. May 14, 2025). The Court of Appeals \ndenied the petition for mandamus, In re U.S. DOGE Serv., 2025 WL 1393222, at *1, and the \ngovernment filed an emergency application to stay the orders of the circuit and district courts with \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. \n  The government’s application to the Supreme Court argued, in essence, that (1) DOGE’s \nagency status is a question of law that depends solely on the text of the executive orders establishing \nit and delineating its purported responsibilities; (2) the separation of powers doctrine precludes \nany discovery against any entity within the Executive Office of the President (“EOP”); and (3) in \nthe alternative, allowing discovery into DOGE’s “recommendations” was overbroad and intrusive \nand that any discovery must be more narrowly tailored. Although the Supreme Court did grant a \nstay, it effectively rejected the government’s first two arguments: the only substantive limitation \nthe Court placed on discovery was to instruct the D.C. Circuit to narrow CREW’s requests \n  10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 17 of 27\nregarding  DOGE’s  “recommendations  and  whether  those  recommendations  were  followed” \nbecause  “inquiry  into  whether  an  entity  is  an  agency  for  the  purposes  of  the  Freedom  of \nInformation Act cannot turn on the entity’s ability to persuade.” U.S Doge Serv. v. Crew, slip op. \nat  1,  no.  24A1222  (U.S.  June  6,  2025),  available  at \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/060625zr_5426.pdf. The Court thus remanded \nto the Court of Appeals to “take appropriate action to narrow the April 15 discovery order \nconsistent with this order,” and ordered that “[t]he April 15, 2025, and May 20, 2025, orders of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of Columbia, case No. 25-cv-511, are stayed pending \nremanded consideration at the Court of Appeals, and disposition of the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari, if such writ is timely sought.”2 Id., slip op. at 2. \n  On July 14, 2025, on CREW’s motion for summary disposition, the Court of Appeals \nnarrowed the scope of discovery in accord with the guidance from the Supreme Court. The district \ncourt subsequently issued a discovery order modifying the discovery as ordered by the Court of \nAppeals, but stayed its schedule “pending disposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari, if such \nwrit is timely sought.” CREW, ECF No. 49. On July 25, the district court then denied DOGE’s \nmotion for summary judgment, which relied solely on the argument that DOGE is not an agency \nsubject to FOIA and the FRA, “as premature, given the potential for discovery following the \n \n2 Defendants wrongly suggest that the Supreme Court’s holding was premised on the principle that \n“an Executive Branch entity’s status under FOIA turns on its formal legal authority . . . .” Defs.’ \nMot. at 4. The Supreme Court made no such finding. Nothing in the Court’s order did anything to \noverturn or undermine decades of D.C. Circuit precedent which instructs that a determination of \nan  EOP  entity’s  agency  status  is  a  mixed  question  of  law  and  fact  requiring  a  functional \nexamination into not only the entity’s formal delegated authority, but also the authority it has \nactually wielded. See, e.g., Meyer v. Bush, 981 F.2d 1288, 1294 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (looking beyond \nthe executive order establishing the entity to also analyze its real-world actions, determining there \nwas “no indication that [the agency in question] directed anyone . . . to do anything.”). \n  11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 18 of 27\ndisposition of any petition for a writ of certiorari that may be filed in this case.” Minute Order, \nCREW (D.D.C.  July 25, 2025). \nThe D.C. Circuit’s July 14 order regarding the scope of CREW’s discovery is the operative \norder that may be the subject of a petition for writ of certiorari. Accordingly, the Supreme Court’s \nadministrative stay remains in place in CREW until at least October 13, the expiration of the \ngovernment’s 90-day window to file a petition, or whenever any such petition is dismissed or \ndecided. In sum, (1) the Supreme Court declined to hold that discovery was inappropriate or \nunavailable to examine whether DOGE is an agency, (2) the Supreme Court, faced with the full \nbreadth of discovery propounded by CREW, required that discovery to be narrowed in one respect, \nand (3) the operative D.C. Circuit order in CREW that determines the timeline of the stay in that \ncase is one that limits discovery precisely as instructed by the Supreme Court.  \n  In seeking to tie the stay to adjudication of DOGE’s agency status, Defendants are asking \nthis Court to stand aside and wait for the resolution of a question that is not even pending in CREW, \nexcusing Defendants here—without any showing of hardship or inequity— from filing a response \nto the Amended Complaint in this case for an indefinite period of time. Consideration of DOGE’s \nagency status in CREW will almost certainly not happen for months or years even at the district \ncourt level. Even if the government declines to petition for a writ of certiorari on the D.C. Circuit’s \nJuly 14 order, discovery in CREW cannot resume until after October 13. And after that date, \ndiscovery will likely take months, with the strong possibility of motions practice and potential \nadditional interlocutory appeals before any merits briefing can occur, much less any hypothetical \nappeals from any final determination by the district court. Such an unjustified, indefinite stay thus \nwould cause significant harm to American Oversight and should be denied. \n  12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 19 of 27\n3.  American Oversight Will Also Be Harmed by the Delay in Adjudication of its FOIA \nRequests \n  FOIA exists “to ensure an informed citizenry, vital to the functioning of a democratic \nsociety, needed to check against corruption and to hold the governors accountable to the governed.” \nNat’l Labor Relations Bd. v. Robbins Tire & Rubber Co., 437 U.S. 214, 242 (1978); see also U.S. \nDep’t of Just. v. Reps. Comm. for Freedom of Press, 489 U.S. 749, 774 (1989) (“FOIA’s central \npurpose is to ensure that the Government’s activities be opened to the sharp eye of public \nscrutiny . . . .” (italics omitted)). Furthermore, it is axiomatic in the FOIA context that “stale \ninformation is of little value,” Payne Enters., Inc. v. United States, 837 F.2d 486, 494 (D.C. Cir. \n1988), and courts have thus sometimes “concluded that a delay in processing of a FOIA request \nwould cause irreparable harm” where it involves “ongoing proceedings of national importance,”  \nBrennan Ctr. for Just. at NYU Sch. of L. v. Dep’t of Com., 498 F. Supp. 3d 87, 101 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(citing Ctr. for Pub. Integrity v. United States Dep’t of Def., 411 F. Supp. 3d 5 (D.D.C. 2019)). \n  American Oversight’s FOIA requests seek records vital to ongoing national discussions \nand debates on issues of high public, media, and congressional interest regarding DOGE’s \ninvolvement in the dismantling of federal agencies, its instructions to agencies on how to respond \nto oversight attempts, and more.  The government’s bald claim that “a stay is unlikely to delay a \nfinal decision regarding” American Oversight’s FOIA requests, Defs.’ Mot. at 10, is baseless. There \nis far too much uncertainty regarding the course each of these separate lawsuits might take to know \nwhether that is true or which suit may first reach the merits question of DOGE’s agency status. A \nstay here thus likely could delay a final ruling on the merits of American Oversight’s FOIA claims \nand thus delay American Oversight’s receipt of any records responsive to those requests. This delay \nfurther harms American Oversight and thwart’s FOIA’s purpose and premise. \n  13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 20 of 27\n4.  American Oversight Will be Harmed by Ongoing Destruction of Records as a Result \nof Defendants’ Deficient Recordkeeping Policies and Practices  \n  Lastly, Defendants have not met their burden to show “no fair possibility” that American \nOversight will be harmed by the deficiencies of Defendants’ recordkeeping policies and practices, \nwhich  risk  the  ongoing  destruction  of  important  federal  records  and  records  responsive  to \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests. See Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. at 20 \n(recognizing  “fair  possibility”  of  harm  to  plaintiffs  whose  organizational  interests  included \nprotection of endangered species put at risk by potential ongoing violations of federal law by \nagency). \n  Under the “no fair possibility” standard, the party seeking a stay bears the burden of \ndemonstrating that “that there is no fair possibility that the stay will work damage to [the non-\nmovant’s] interests.” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 20 (citation modified). In \nCenter for Biological Diversity, plaintiffs alleged that a Biological Opinion issued by the National \nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) represented an ongoing violation of the Endangered Species Act \n(“ESA”) because it would permit lobster fishery that would jeopardize the endangered North \nAtlantic right whale. See id. at 19. NMFS sought a stay on the grounds that in nine months, it \nintended to issue a new Biological Opinion and Take Reduction Plan that would moot plaintiffs’ \nclaims. Id. The court agreed with the plaintiffs that “NMFS’s alleged ongoing violations of the \nESA and Marine Mammal Protection Act would continue unabated during the pendency of a stay, \nfurther endangering North Atlantic right whales and thus harming Plaintiffs’ interests in conserving \nthe ever-diminishing right whale population.” Id. at 20 (internal quotation omitted). Thus, the court \nconcluded that NMFS had “failed to convince the Court that there is no fair possibility that the \nstay will work damage to Plaintiffs’ interests.” Id. (citation modified). \n  14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 21 of 27\n  As in Center for Biological Diversity, American Oversight has alleged ongoing violations \nof important federal law—namely, the Federal Records Act. Specifically, the Amended Complaint \nalleges that DOGE’s use of ephemeral messaging systems such as Signal and document platforms \nsuch as Google Docs, absent adequate policies to ensure preservation of all federal records, \nthreatens the ongoing loss of those records. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 180–221, ECF No. 14. Indeed, every \nday this litigation continues, more records may be destroyed. Where the documents at risk of loss \ninclude those that may be subject to pending FOIA requests by American Oversight, id. ¶¶ 247–\n60, and where Plaintiff is an organization “committed to promoting transparency in government, \neducating the public about government activities, and ensuring the accountability of government \nofficials” through research and FOIA requests, id. ¶ 9, American Oversight (and the American \npublic) will be harmed by the destruction of these records, see Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in \nWashington v. Off. of Admin., 565 F. Supp. 2d 23, 30 (D.D.C. 2008) (finding a “clear” case of \nirreparable harm if plaintiff “could not ultimately access the documents responsive to its FOIA \nrequest because they had not been preserved” because it “would have absolutely no recourse in the \nevent that records potentially responsive to its FOIA requests were destroyed”). \nDefendants claim that their purported compliance with the Presidential Records Act means \nthat American Oversight cannot “show any other prejudice.” Defs.’ Mot. at 10. But even if DOGE \nis fully complying with the Presidential Records Act (“PRA”), that does not ensure compliance \nwith the FRA. Federal law distinguishes “agency records,” “federal records,” and “presidential \nrecords.” “Agency records” under FOIA is the broadest category. Under FOIA, any document is \nan agency record subject to FOIA if it was “created or obtained” by the agency and the agency is \n“in control of the requested materials at the time the FOIA request is made.” U.S. Dep’t of Just. v. \nTax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 144–45 (1989). The definition of “records” under the FRA is somewhat \n  15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 22 of 27\nnarrower, but still robust. See 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A) (defining “records” as those “made or \nreceived by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public \nbusiness and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its legitimate successor \nas evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other \nactivities of the United States Government or because of the informational value of data in them”). \nAnd the definition of “presidential records” under the PRA is narrower still: only those documents \n“created or received by the President, the President’s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the \nExecutive Office of the President whose function is to advise and assist the President, in the course \nof conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, \nstatutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.” 44 U.S.C. § 2201(2). For \nexample, all of Steve Davis’s Signal messages relating to government business would qualify as \nagency  records  under  FOIA  and  as  federal  records  under  the  FRA,  but  they  may  not  be \n“presidential records” under the PRA to the extent they do not relate to carrying out the President’s \n“constitutional, statutory, or other official or ceremonial duties.”  \n  Furthermore,  the PRA’s records preservation requirements are much looser and  less \nenforceable than those that apply to DOGE as an agency. In comparing the FRA with the PRA, the \nD.C.  Circuit  emphasized  that  “[w]hereas  federal  records  are  subject  to  a  strict  document \nmanagement regime supervised by the Archivist, . . . the PRA ‘accords the President virtually \ncomplete control over his records during his term of office.’” Armstrong v. Exec. Off. of the \nPresident, Off. of Admin., 1 F.3d 1274, 1290–91 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation and citation \nomitted). That is, a sitting President has unreviewable authority to order the destruction of \npresidential records. “Neither the Archivist nor an agency head can initiate any action through the \nAttorney General to effect recovery or ensure preservation of presidential records.” Id. at 1291. \n  16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 23 of 27\nMoreover, although the Archivist may “request congressional advice regarding the President’s \nintention to dispose of presidential records. . . . neither the Archivist nor the Congress has the \nauthority to veto the President’s disposal decision.” Id. (internal quotation omitted). \n  As explained in the Amended Complaint, DOGE’s Records Retention policy fails to ensure \nthe adequate preservation of records in at least three key ways. Am. Comp. ¶¶ 222–29, ECF No. \n14. First, it advises, but does not require, that DOGE employees disable auto-delete features on \nmessaging platforms like Signal. Id. ¶ 226. Second, it does not require employees to use work \ndevices for all work-related activities. Id. ¶ 227. Third, it fails to require the preservation of “notes, \ndrafts, or similar documents that are not circulated or that are not created or saved for purposes of \ndocumenting the activities or deliberations of the Administration.” Id. ¶ 228. But even if its policy \ndid not bear these flaws, DOGE’s insistence that it is only subject to the PRA means that, even \nwhile this litigation is pending, the President might order the destruction of these records. \n  The government does not address these risks, instead quoting a ruling in an unrelated matter \nby an unrelated plaintiff that did not oppose a stay in its proceeding. Defs.’ Mot. at 10 (quoting \nJune 17, 2025 Mem. Op. in POGO v. Trump, Civ. A. No. 25-0527 that “Defendants have given the \nCourt ample reasons to believe that they are complying with the PRA”). However, whatever risk \nof harm the plaintiff in that case may or may not be subject to, that decision does not address \n(through some form of non-mutual issue preclusion, or otherwise) the harm that  American \nOversight would face.   \n  In sum, there is far more than a “fair possibility”—and, at minimum, the government has \nfailed to meet its burden of demonstrating that there is no fair possibility—that American Oversight \nwill be harmed by a stay because DOGE will be permitted to maintain its FRA-noncompliant \npolicies and practices that threaten the continued destruction of federal records. \n  17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 24 of 27\nB.  Defendant’s Failure to Demonstrate Hardship or Inequity in Being Required to \nGo Forward Is Fatal to Their Request for a Stay.  \n   Because there is “a fair possibility that the stay will injure” American Oversight in at least \nfour different ways, Defendants must “demonstrate clearly a justification for the potential harm to \nthe Plaintiff[] (presumably rooted in Defendants’ own hardship) . . . .” See Nat’l Indus. for Blind, \n296 F. Supp. 3d at 141. Incredibly, Defendants’ only attempt to demonstrate harm and carry their \nburden is a single sentence stating that “requiring Defendants to continue to defend this action in \nDistrict Court without waiting for appellate resolution of the issues raised here would be a wasteful \nand inefficient exercise for both Defendants and the Court . . . .” Mot. at 10. But it is well settled \nthat “being required to defend a suit, without more, does not constitute a clear case of hardship or \ninequity.” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 21 (citation modified); see also OCA - \nAsian Pac. Am. Advocs., 2025 WL 1393153, at *2 (same); Asylumworks v. Mayorkas, No. 20-CV-\n3815 (BAH), 2021 WL 2227335, at *6 (D.D.C. June 1, 2021) (agency’s “expenditure of resources \nin proceeding with the litigation” was “wholly insufficient to warrant a stay”); United States v. \nHoneywell Int’l, 20 F. Supp. 3d 129, 133 (D.D.C. 2013) (“[T]he time it will take for its witnesses \nto sit for depositions” was insufficient demonstration of hardship.). “This is ‘particularly true of \ncounsel for the United States, the richest, most powerful, and best represented litigant to appear \nbefore [the Court].’” Ctr. for Biological Diversity, 419 F. Supp. 3d at 21 (quoting Greenlaw v. \nUnited States, 554 U.S. 237, 244 (2008)) (alteration in original). \n  Additionally, as discussed supra, the stay sought by the government is likely to last months, \nif not years, because an ultimate merits determination on DOGE’s agency status in the CREW case \ncould require years of litigation and likely multiple rounds of appeals. Thus, it is “sufficiently \nindefinite to require a finding of a pressing need under [the Supreme Court’s decision in] Landis.” \n  18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 25 of 27\nBelize Soc. Dev. Ltd., 668 F.3d at 732. Having made no showing of cognizable harm, much less a \n“pressing need,” Defendants’ motion must fail. \nC.  A Stay Will Not Promote Judicial Economy Because the Issues at Stake in \nCREW’s Case Differ Significantly From Those Presented Here. \n  Defendants’ motion rests on the false premise that the legal questions at issue in CREW \nwill be outcome-determinative or significantly narrow the issues in the instant case and confuses \nwhat is at stake in CREW’s case with what is before the Court here. See Defs.’ Mot. at 9 (“[A] stay \npending further proceedings in CREW may narrow the issues before the Court in this case and the \nscope of any discovery.”). Again, the only pending issue in CREW’s case is whether CREW’s \ndiscovery requests, as narrowed and approved by the D.C. Circuit on July 14 and ordered by the \ndistrict court on July 15, are properly scoped. They appear to be, based on the Supreme Court’s \nJune 6, 2025 order, but that order stalls discovery from going forward only in CREW’s case until \ndisposition of a hypothetical petition for certiorari.  \nHere, Defendants have not even filed a responsive pleading. American Oversight has not \nfiled any motion to take discovery, let alone served actual discovery requests.3 This renders \nnonsensical even Defendants’ fallback position, that a stay should issue at least until resolution of \nthe discovery questions in CREW. Defendants’ assertion that a stay serves judicial economy \nbecause it “may narrow the issues before the Court in this case and the scope of any discovery,” \nsee Defs.’ Mot. at 9, ignores the basic fact that until this case reaches the stage where discovery \ncan be and has been sought, it is impossible to know whether the same issues would even arise \nhere. Defendants thus fall far short of showing the requisite certainty that proceedings on which \nthe stay is premised will reach the same questions of law. Where there is uncertainty about whether \n \n3 American Oversight reserves the right to seek discovery, but whether or how it exercises that \nright would depend, at minimum, on reviewing the government’s responsive pleadings to the \nAmended Complaint.  \n  19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 26 of 27\nthe proceedings upon which the stay is premised will reach the same questions of law, there is no \nbenefit to judicial economy. See, e.g., Dellinger v. Mitchell, 442 F.2d 782, 787 (D.C. Cir. 1971) (it \nis not “unseemly or lacking in respect for a court of coordinate jurisdiction” to take up a question \npending in another court where it is uncertain that the other court will reach the issue); Nat’l Indus. \nFor Blind, 296 F. Supp. 3d at 142–43 (rejecting request for stay where there was “considerable \nuncertainty” regarding whether Federal Circuit would “reach the legal issue that is common to \nthese cases”); United States v. Honeywell, 20 F. Supp. 3d 129, 132 (D.D.C. 2013) (rejecting stay \nof discovery where government failed to “specify what questions of fact or law that the dispositive \nmotions raise, or provide any analysis of how resolution of each question one way or the other \nwould simplify discovery or narrow issues in this case, or state how Honeywell would be bound \nby resolution of an issue in a case to which it is not a party”).  \nAs discussed supra, the merits question of DOGE’s agency status is not yet even pending \nin CREW at the district court level, much less in the D.C. Circuit or Supreme Court, and is not \nlikely to be pending for many months or years. Of course, it would always be helpful to have \nmeaningful guidance from the Supreme Court on important questions, but to stay a case based on \na question that might be pending on an indeterminate timeline in unrelated proceedings is simply \nnot how our court system is set up, nor what stays are meant to enable. See OCA - Asian Pac. Am. \nAdvocs., 2025 WL 1393153, at *2 (“the risk of inconsistent opinions between courts when one \ndoes not bind the other is no reason to force Plaintiff to ‘stand aside’”) (quoting Landis, 299 U.S. \nat 255)); cf. also Hisler v. Gallaudet Univ., 344 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2004) (“[S]tating a \npossibility of inconsistencies in rulings on the same issue, without any explanation on how her \nclaim will suffer any harm, does not establish, in itself, a clear case of hardship.” (quotations \n  20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 17     Filed 08/19/25     Page 27 of 27\nomitted)); Nat’l Indus. for Blind, 296 F. Supp. 3d at 141 (possibility of “inconsistent judgments” \nis not hardship). \n  CONCLUSION \n   For the foregoing reasons, American Oversight respectfully requests that the Court deny \nDefendants’ motion to stay these proceedings and order Defendants to respond to the Amended \nComplaint within 14 days. \nDated: August 19, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n    /s/ David Kronig \n   David Kronig \n  D.C.

Since January 20, 2025, the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency \nhas operated at breakneck speed to overhaul and diminish the Executive Branch of the federal \ngovernment, all while operating largely in secrecy. \n2.  The new agency, commonly referred to as DOGE, has spread its influence and \nembedded staff across the executive branch, dismantling entire agencies, canceling previously \napproved grants and contracts, overruling instructions from Senate-confirmed Cabinet members, \ndirecting the termination of tens of thousands of federal employees, and more. \n3.  Despite, or perhaps because of, DOGE’s unprecedented scope and scale, the agency \nhas obfuscated even the most basic information about its internal operations, up to and including \nthe identity of the person in charge of its efforts. \n4.  This obfuscation features prominently in DOGE’s repeated, systemic failures to \npreserve and produce records pursuant to the Federal Records Act (“FRA”) and Freedom of \nInformation Act (“FOIA”). DOGE uses nongovernmental, ephemeral messaging platforms like \nSignal and electronic document collaboration platforms like Google Docs, which lack the effective \ncontrols or safeguards necessary to ensure that public records are not being wrongfully destroyed.  \n2  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 3 of 69\n5.  This action is necessary to redress Defendants’ failures to meet their obligations \nunder the FRA and FOIA. Specifically, DOGE’s use of ephemeral messaging platforms and \nelectronic document collaboration platforms to conduct official government business without \nadequate policies, whether formal or informal, in place to preserve agency records violates its \nrecord-keeping obligations.  \n6.  Plaintiff American Oversight brings this action under the Federal Records Act \n(“FRA”), 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101 et seq., and the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”), 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 701 et seq., to prevent the unlawful destruction of federal records and to compel Defendants to \nfulfill their legal obligations to preserve and recover federal records created through unauthorized \nor noncompliant use of ephemeral messaging platforms and electronic document platforms, and \nunder the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552 (“FOIA”), and the Declaratory Judgment \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to compel compliance \nwith the requirements of FOIA in connection with FOIA requests for key records regarding \nDefendants’ activities. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n7.  This Court has personal and subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises under federal law, specifically the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ \n701 et seq., the FRA, 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301 et seq., FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552, and the Declaratory \nJudgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202. \n8.  Venue  is  proper  in  this  district  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1391(e)  and  5  U.S.C.  § \n552(a)(4)(B). \n3  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 4 of 69\nPARTIES \n9.  Plaintiff American Oversight is a nonpartisan, non-profit corporation organized \nunder section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and incorporated under the laws of the \nDistrict of Columbia. It is committed to promoting transparency in government, educating the \npublic about government activities, and ensuring the accountability of government officials. \nThrough research and FOIA requests, American Oversight uses the information it gathers, and its \nanalysis of that information, to educate the public about the activities and operations of the federal \ngovernment through reports, published analyses, press releases and other media.  \n10.  In the regular course of its work and in furtherance of its core mission and function, \nAmerican Oversight has submitted FOIA requests to Defendants Department of Government \nEfficiency, U.S. DOGE Service, and U.S. DOGE Temporary Service Organization (collectively, \n“DOGE Defendants” or “DOGE”), and will continue to seek records from the DOGE Defendants \nin the future.1 \n11.  In the regular course of its work and in furtherance of its core mission and function, \nAmerican Oversight has sent more than two dozen FOIA requests to DOGE, and intends to \ncontinue to send FOIA requests to DOGE and make available to the public any records it receives \nin response. \n12.  Defendant U.S. Department of Government Efficiency is a department of the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the \nfederal government within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n \n1 For purposes of this suit, American Oversight uses the acronym “DOGE” to refer collectively to \nDefendants Department of Government Efficiency, U.S. DOGE Service, and U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization because it is the acronym used publicly by Elon Musk, President Trump, \nand other White House officials when referring to actions taken by USDS and/or agency heads \noperating on directives from Musk and other DOGE officials. \n4  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 5 of 69\n551(1),  and  FOIA,  5  U.S.C.  §§  551(1),  552(f)(1).  See  Establishing  and  Implementing  the \nPresident’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” Exec. Order No. 14,158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 \n(Jan. 20, 2025), https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02005.pdf. \n13.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service (“USDS”) is an establishment in the executive \nbranch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the federal \ngovernment within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 551(1), \nand FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 552(f)(1).  See id. \n14.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is an establishment in the \nexecutive branch of the U.S. government headquartered in Washington, D.C., and an agency of the \nfederal government within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), the APA, 5 U.S.C. § \n551(1), and FOIA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), 552(f)(1).  See id. \n15.  Defendant Elon Musk is or was one of the functional heads of DOGE and is sued \nin his official capacity. \n16.  In that capacity, he is or was the agency head of the U.S. Department of Government \nEfficiency, USDS, and U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n17.  Defendant Steven (“Steve”) Davis is or was one of the functional heads of DOGE \nand is sued in his official capacity. \n18.  In that capacity, he is or was the agency head of the U.S. Department of Government \nEfficiency, USDS, and U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization, and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n5  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 6 of 69\n19.  Defendant Amy Gleason is the Acting Administrator of USDS and is sued in her \nofficial capacity. \n20.  In that capacity, she is the agency head of the USDS and obligated to perform \ncertain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. §§ 3101, 3102(1), 3105, and \n3106.  \n21.  Defendant Marco Rubio is the Acting Archivist of the United States and is sued in \nhis official capacity. As Acting Archivist of the United States, Defendant Rubio is obligated to \nperform certain nondiscretionary duties under the FRA. See, e.g., 44 U.S.C. § 3106.  \n22.  Defendant National Archives and Records Administration (“NARA”) is a federal \nagency within the meaning of the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 2901(14), and the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 551(1), \n552(f)(1), and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.  \n23.  As further demonstrated below, because Defendants Department of Government \nEfficiency,  USDS,  and  U.S.  DOGE  Service Temporary  Organization  each  have  duties  and \nauthority that go beyond simply advising the President, they are all subject to FOIA and the FRA. \n24.  Upon information and belief, Defendant Department of Government Efficiency has \npossession, custody, and control of records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests.  \n25.  Upon information and belief, Defendant USDS has possession, custody, and control \nof records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests.  \n26.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendant  U.S.  DOGE  Service  Temporary \nOrganization has possession, custody, and control of records responsive to American Oversight’s \nFOIA requests.  \n6  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 7 of 69\nLEGAL FRAMEWORK \n \nFederal Records Act \n \n27.  The FRA governs the creation, management, and disposal of “records” by federal \nagencies. See generally 44 U.S.C. § 3301 et seq; see also 44 U.S.C. Chs. 21, 29, and 31. \n28.  The FRA defines “records” to include: \n[A]ll recorded information, regardless of form or characteristics, made or received \nby a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of \npublic business and preserved or appropriate for preservation by that agency or its \nlegitimate successor as evidence of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, \nprocedures, operations, or other activities of the United States Government or \nbecause of the informational value of data in them[.] \n \n44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A).   \n \n29.  The  FRA  further  specifies  that  “the  term  ‘recorded  information’  includes  all \ntraditional forms of records, regardless of physical form or characteristics, including information \ncreated, manipulated, communicated, or stored in digital or electronic form.” Id. § 3301(a)(2). \n30.  The  FRA  provides  that  the Archivist’s  determination  about  whether  recorded \ninformation is a federal record is “binding on all Federal agencies,” id. § 3301(b), and NARA’s \nregulations provide that “[w]orking files, such as preliminary drafts and rough notes, and other \nsimilar  materials,  are  records  that  must  be  maintained  to  ensure  adequate  and  proper \ndocumentation if”: \n(1) They were circulated or made available to employees, other than the creator, \nfor official purposes such as approval, comment, action, recommendation, \nfollow-up, or to communicate with agency staff about agency business; and \n(2) They contain unique information, such as substantive annotations or comments \nthat adds to a proper understanding of the agency’s formulation and execution \nof basic policies, decisions, actions, or responsibilities. \n \n36 C.F.R. § 1222.12(c). \n7  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 8 of 69\n31.  As applied to the operations of DOGE, the FRA imposes duties on the heads of the \nagency and the Archivist of the United States.  \n32.  To comply with the statute, the agency head “shall make and preserve records \ncontaining adequate and proper documentation of the organization, functions, policies, decisions, \nprocedures, and essential transactions of the agency and designed to furnish the information \nnecessary to protect the legal and financial rights of the Government and of persons directly \naffected by the agency’s activities.” 44 U.S.C. § 3101. \n33.  An agency head is further required to establish a records management program \nproviding “effective controls over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. \n§ 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records the head of [the] \nagency determines to be necessary and required by regulations of the Archivist,” id. § 3105.  \n34.  Under the FRA, “[a]n officer or employee of an executive agency may not create \nor send a record using a non-official electronic messaging account unless such officer or employee \n(1) copies an official electronic messaging account of the officer or employee in the original \ncreation or transmission of the record; or (2) forwards a complete copy of the record to an official \nelectronic messaging account of the officer or employee not later than 20 days after the original \ncreation or transmission of the record.” Id. § 2911(a). \n35.  When records are handled in a manner that contravenes the FRA or a parallel \nagency record-keeping policy, the FRA obligates the agency head to “notify the Archivist of any \nactual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, corruption, deletion, \nerasure, or other destruction of records in the custody of the agency . . . .” Id. § 3106(a). \n8  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 9 of 69\n36.  The FRA further dictates that the agency head, with the assistance of the Archivist, \n“shall initiate action through the Attorney General for the recovery of records” that the agency \nhead “knows or has reason to believe have been unlawfully removed from [the] agency . . . .” Id.  \n37.  If the agency head fails to initiate an action for recovery of unlawfully removed \nrecords “or other redress within a reasonable period of time after being notified of any such \nunlawful action, or is participating in, or believed to be participating in any such unlawful action,” \nthe FRA dictates that “the Archivist shall request the Attorney General to initiate such an action, \nand shall notify Congress when such a request has been made.” Id. § 3106(b). \n38.  The obligations to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General to \nrecover  unlawfully  removed  records  or  for  other  redress  are  mandatory,  not  subject  to  the \ndiscretion of the agency head nor the Archivist. See Armstrong v. Bush, 924 F.2d 282, 295–96 \n(D.C. Cir. 1991). \n39.  Where both the agency head and the Archivist have “failed to initiate remedial \naction in a timely manner, private litigants may sue under the APA to require them to do so.” \nCitizens for Resp. & Ethics in Washington v. U.S. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 527 F. Supp. 2d 101, \n110 (D.D.C. 2007) (internal quotation omitted). \n40.  Furthermore, “the APA authorizes judicial review of a claim—properly pleaded, of \ncourse—that the [agency’s] recordkeeping policies are arbitrary and capricious and do not comport \nwith the requirements of the FRA.” Id. at 111. \n41.  “The APA also authorizes the Court to entertain a claim that the head of the [agency] \nor the Archivist have breached their statutory obligations to take enforcement action to prevent an \nagency official from improperly destroying records or to recover records unlawfully removed from \nthe agency.” Id. \n9  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 10 of 69\nFreedom of Information Act \n42.  Under FOIA, any document is an agency record subject to FOIA if it was “create[d] \nor obtaine[d]” by the agency and the agency is “in control of the requested materials at the time \nthe FOIA request is made.” U.S. Dep’t of Just. v. Tax Analysts, 492 U.S. 136, 144–45 (1989). \n43.  FOIA requires all federal agencies to make agency records available to the public \nunless one of its specified exemptions applies. See id. at 150–51; 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). \n44.  Within 20 working days of receiving a FOIA request, agencies are required to tell \nthe requestor the scope of records that will be produced or withheld, and the reasons for such \nwithholdings. See 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(A)(i). \n45.  Agencies are further required to make such records “promptly available to any \nperson” who reasonably describes the records they seek. Id. § 552(a)(3)(A). \n46.  An agency may not “destroy[] a document after it has been requested under FOIA.” \nChambers v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 568 F.3d 998, 1004 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \nPresidential Records Act \n47.  Protections under the Presidential Records Act (“PRA”) are limited to documents \n“created or received by the President, the President’s immediate staff, or a unit or individual of the \nExecutive Office of the President whose function is to advise and assist the President, in the course \nof conducting activities which relate to or have an effect upon the carrying out of the constitutional, \nstatutory, or other official or ceremonial duties of the President.” 44 U.S.C. § 2201(2). \n48.  The PRA provides the President broad discretion over the preservation or disposal \nof presidential records. \n49.  In comparing the FRA with the PRA, the D.C. Circuit emphasized that “[w]hereas \nfederal records are subject to a strict document management regime supervised by the Archivist, . \n1 0 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 11 of 69\n. . the PRA ‘accords the President virtually complete control over his records during his term of \noffice.’ . . . . Neither the Archivist nor an agency head can initiate any action through the Attorney \nGeneral to effect recovery or ensure preservation of presidential records.” Armstrong v. Exec. Off. \nof the President, Off. of Admin., 1 F.3d 1274, 1290–91 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted). \n50.  Although the Archivist may “request congressional advice regarding the President’s \nintention to dispose of presidential records . . . , neither the Archivist nor the Congress has the \nauthority to veto the President’s disposal decision.” Id. at 1291 (internal quotation omitted). \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \n \nDOGE’s Formation \n \n51.  In November 2024, a week after the presidential election, then President-elect \nDonald Trump announced that Elon Musk would be named the head of the newly created \nDepartment of Government Efficiency, which Trump referred to as “DOGE.”2  \n52.  The acronym appears to reference the Musk-backed cryptocurrency DOGE coin.3 \n53.  DOGE’s structure and function were initially unclear, including whether it would \nbe housed within the federal government or as an external entity.4 \n54.  During the presidential transition period, the DOGE team operated out of the \nWashington, D.C. office of Tesla, Inc.5  \n \n2 Elena Moore et al., Trump Taps Musk to Lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' with \nRamaswamy, NPR (Nov. 12, 2024, 9:03 PM), https://www.npr.org/2024/11/12/g-s1-\n33972/trump-elon-musk-vivek-ramaswamy-doge-government-efficiency-deep-state.  \n3 Id.  \n4 Moore et al., supra note 2. \n5 Eric Katz, DOGE Agency Deployments Raise Ethical and Influence Concerns, Gov’t Exec., \n(Jan. 15, 2025), https://www.govexec.com/management/2025/01/doge-agency-deployments-\nraise-ethical-and-influence-concerns/402204/.  \n11  \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 12 of 69\n55.  Musk is Tesla’s Chief Executive Officer and largest shareholder.6 \n56.  During  the  presidential  transition  period,  Musk  and  DOGE  representatives \ncommunicated with federal agencies concerning DOGE’s plans for those agencies in the new \nadministration.7  \n57.  These communications happened via Signal in at least some instances.8 \n58.  Upon taking office, Trump issued an executive order “to implement the President’s \nDOGE Agenda, by modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental \nefficiency and productivity.” Establishing and Implementing the President’s “Department of \nGovernment Efficiency,” Exec. Order No. 14,158, 90 Fed. Reg. 8441 (Jan. 20, 2025), available at \nhttps://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-01-29/pdf/2025-02005.pdf. \n59.  This first DOGE executive order renames the U.S. Digital Service as the U.S. \nDOGE Service and creates a temporary organization within it called the “U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization,” “headed by the USDS Administrator” and “dedicated to advancing the \nPresident’s 18-month DOGE agenda.” Id. Under the executive order, the U.S. DOGE Service \nTemporary Organization sunsets on July 4, 2026. See id. \n60.  The first DOGE executive order further requires each “Agency Head” to establish \na DOGE Team within each agency of the executive branch.

Whereas the legacy U.S. Digital Service was a component within the Office of \nManagement and Budget (“OMB”)—a standalone entity within the Executive Office of the \nPresident (“EOP”) that is subject to the FRA and FOIA—the first executive order moved the U.S. \nDOGE Service out of OMB to make it a separate entity within EOP. See id. \n62.  Trump issued a second DOGE executive order on February 11, 2025, that directs \nAgency Heads to develop “a data-driven plan, in consultation with its DOGE Team Lead, to ensure \nnew career appointment hires are in highest-need areas,” and requires that new career appointment \nhiring decisions “be made in consultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead.” See Implementing \nthe President’s “Department of Government Efficiency” Workforce Optimization Initiative, Exec. \nOrder  No.  14,210  at  §  3,  90  Fed.

Trump’s third DOGE-related executive order, issued February 26, 2025, provides \nfurther evidence of DOGE’s agency status.

It requires each Agency Head to work with their embedded DOGE Team Leads to: \n“build a centralized technological system” with the capability to “pause and rapidly review any \npayment for which the approving employee has not submitted a brief, written justification”; review \nexisting contracts and terminate or modify them “to promote efficiency and advance the policies \nof [the] Administration”; provide monthly reports to the USDS Administrator justifying “non-\nessential travel” expenditures; and freeze all credit cards held by agency employees for 30 days.

DOGE’s agency status is being litigated in multiple lawsuits in this district.10 \n65.  At least two judges in this district have preliminarily found that DOGE is likely an \nagency.11 \nLeadership of DOGE \n66.  On  information  and  belief,  the Administration  has  purposefully  obscured  the \nleadership structure of DOGE. \n67.  As described more fully below, at all times relevant to this action, there are at least \nthree individuals who may be the functional head of DOGE or have shared responsibilities for co-\nleading DOGE: Elon Musk, who has been the public face of DOGE since its announcement in \nNovember 2024; Amy Gleason, who the Administration has named as the Acting Administrator of \nthe U.S. DOGE Service; and Steve Davis, a longtime aide to Musk and the person reportedly \nrunning DOGE’s day-to-day operations. \n68.  Elon  Musk  was  named  as  head  of  DOGE  at  its  inception  prior  to Trump’s \ninauguration. \n \n10 See, e.g., First Am. Compl., Am. Oversight v.

Musk directed DOGE’s work upon Trump’s inauguration. \n70.  On information and belief, at all times relevant to this action, Musk has directed at \nleast some of DOGE’s work and was responsible for overseeing the President’s “DOGE Agenda.” \n71.  Trump, White House officials, and Musk himself have repeatedly and publicly \nemphasized Musk’s control over DOGE.   \n72.  On February 5, 2025, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that \nTrump “was elected with a mandate from the American people to make this government more \nefficient. He campaigned across this country with Elon Musk vowing that Elon was going to head \nup the Department of Government Efficiency.”12  \n73.  In the same February 5 press conference, Leavitt, when asked about Musk’s \npotential conflicts of interest, stated that “if Elon Musk comes across a conflict of interest with the \ncontracts and the funding that DOGE is overseeing, then Elon will excuse himself from those \ncontracts.”13 \n74.  The White House told U.S. District Judge Tanya S. Chutkan on February 17, 2025, \nthat Musk is neither the DOGE Administrator nor a DOGE employee and “has no actual or formal \nauthority to make government decisions himself—including personnel decisions at individual \nagencies.”14  \n \n12 White House, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt Briefs Members of the Media, YouTube (Feb. 5, \n2025), https://www.youtube.com/live/0QJrwxIZGW8?t=1450s [24:10 – 24:21].   \n13 Id. \n14 Notice by Elon Musk et al. at 1, and Decl. of Joshua Fisher, State of New Mexico et al. v.

However, that statement is contradicted by Musk’s public statements and other \nevidence, including that Musk directed mass “What did you do last week?” emails to federal \nemployees requiring them to respond or face termination.15  \n76.  The White House’s representation on February 17 is also contradicted by Trump’s \nown public statements.  \n77.  Just three days after the White House’s representations to Judge Chutkan, Trump \ntold an audience of investors and company executives in Miami, “I signed an order creating the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency and put a man named Elon Musk in charge.”16 \n78.  President Trump and Press Secretary Leavitt have repeatedly talked about Musk as \nthe functional leader of DOGE. \n79.  On February 22, 2025, Trump posted on the site Truth Social, “ELON IS DOING \nA GREAT JOB, BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM GET MORE AGGRESSIVE.”17 \n80.  Musk responded on X (formerly Twitter) by posting a screenshot of Trump’s \nmessage and adding, “Will do, Mr. President!”18 \n \n15 Andrea Hsu, A Pattern Emerges in Elon Musk's Federal Shakeup: 'Break First, Ask Questions \nLater', NPR (Feb. 26, 2025), https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5308659/federal-employees-\nmusk-trump-chaos.  \n16 Andrea Shalal & Nandita Bose, Trump Appears to Contradict White House, Says Elon Musk in \nCharge of DOGE, Reuters (Feb. 20, 2025 12:27 PM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-\nappears-contradict-white-house-says-elon-musk-charge-doge-2025-02-20/. \n17 Rachel Wolf, Trump Says Elon Musk Should Be ‘More Aggressive’ on DOGE Cuts, Musk \nResponds, FOX Business (Feb. 22, 2025 11:32 AM), \nhttps://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-says-elon-musk-should-more-aggressive-doge-cuts.  \n18 Id.; see also Elon Musk (@elonmusk), X (formerly Twitter) (Feb. 22, 2025 11:08 AM), \nhttps://x.com/elonmusk/status/1893332118752706661.  \n1 6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 17 of 69\n81.  On February 25, 2025, Leavitt reiterated Trump’s desire for Musk to be “more \naggressive,” explaining that this was “because DOGE thus far has proven incredibly successful in \nmaking our government more efficient.”19 \n82.  In the same February 25 briefing, when asked to identify the USDS Administrator, \nLeavitt stated that “the President tasked Elon Musk to oversee the DOGE effort.”20 \n83.  On February 26, 2025, Musk attended and spoke at length at the first Cabinet \nmeeting of the new administration.21 \n84.  In explaining Musk’s attendance at the Cabinet meeting, Leavitt stated that “Elon \nis working with the Cabinet secretaries and their staff every single day to identify waste and fraud \nand abuse at these respective agencies. All of the Cabinet secretaries take the advice and direction \nof DOGE.”22 \n85.  On March 4, 2025, President Trump in an address to Congress confirmed that Musk \nleads DOGE, stating “. . .

Some Republican senators were given Musk’s phone number so they could have \ndirect access to seek his help getting “problematic cuts” made by DOGE “quickly reversed.”24 \n87.  On April 28, 2025, Musk posted on X (formerly Twitter): “Knock, knock … it’s \n@DOGE.” The post included a photo of Musk himself holding a badge meant to look like a law \nenforcement badge; the badge read “THE DOGEFATHER” above a logo, “DOGE” below the logo, \nand included the “badge number” 69420.25 \n88.  However, in late February, the White House announced that Amy Gleason was the \nActing Administrator of USDS.26 \n89.  Gleason filed a sworn declaration in another action in this District on March 14, \n2025, stating that she “serve[s] as the Acting Administrator of USDS” and is a “full-time, \ngovernment employee at USDS,” and as such, she “oversee[s] all of USDS’s employees and \ndetailees to USDS from other agencies.”27 \n90.

Between  February  5  and  February  18,  DOGE  lacked  “a  formal  acting \nadministrator,” but “at the time, Steve Davis was the senior-most political advisor,” so Davis made \ndecisions that “Gleason later ratified.”33   \n96.  The White House announced that Davis left government service on May 29, 2025.34 \n97.  However, even after the announced departure, Davis remained in touch with DOGE \nstaffers, continuing to act as DOGE’s leader.35  \n98.  For example, in June 2025, Davis called and ran a DOGE meeting in a government \nbuilding at which he purported to announce “DOGE 2.0.” \n99.

However, shortly thereafter, President Trump claimed that Musk was “not really \nleaving.”39 \n103.  Thus,  the  leadership  structure  of  DOGE—like  much  about  its  operations—\ncontinues to be shrouded in mystery. \nDOGE Wields Substantial Independent Authority Across the Executive Branch \n104.   As alleged more fully below, DOGE’s authority extends across the executive \nbranch. \n105.  DOGE enjoys substantial free rein to implement the “DOGE agenda” as it sees fit, \nissuing commands to entities and persons within the executive branch—commands that agency \nofficials and Cabinet secretaries treat as legally authoritative. \n106.  DOGE exercises this authority independent of the President and senior White \nHouse officials, who often are unaware of DOGE’s actions until they are made public.40 \n \n37 Shalini Ramachandran et al., The Fight Between Musk Acolytes and the White House for \nControl of DOGE, Wall St. J.

For instance, even after White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles instructed Musk to \nkeep her informed of his plans, Musk used Office of Personnel Management (“OPM”) systems to \nsend an email to 2.3 million federal employees without clearing his plan through any White House \nofficials.41 \n108.  The message instructed federal employees to send an email documenting their \naccomplishments for the previous week and said that any nonresponse would be considered a \nresignation.42 \n109.  In just the first three weeks of the new administration, DOGE staffers accessed the \noffices of at least 15 executive branch agencies.43  \n110.  They have since accessed the offices and/or computer systems of many more \nagencies.  \n111.  With respect to these agencies, DOGE staff have shuttered and dramatically shrunk \nfederal agencies, rendered decisions related to agency payments or agency personnel, ordered \nagency supervisors or staff to take various actions, and gained access to computer systems \npreviously available only to agency employees. \n \nrift-white-house-trumps/story?id=119179219 (“When billionaire Elon Musk posted on X last \nweekend that all federal employees would soon receive an email demanding details of their work \nfrom the past week, senior White House officials—who had not been fully briefed on the plan—\nwere initially caught off guard.”) \n41 See Nandita Bose et al., Ultimatum to Federal Workers Raises Tensions Between Musk, White \nHouse Staff, Reuters (Feb. 27, 2025 6:09 AM), https://www.reuters.com/world/us/ultimatum-\nfederal-workers-raises-tensions-between-musk-white-house-staff-2025-02-27/.  \n42 See id. \n43 See, e.g., Wash.

On or around February 1, 2025, DOGE \npersonnel insisted that they be granted access to systems at USAID, threatening to call law \nenforcement when officials at USAID refused.44   \n113.  DOGE staffers did subsequently gain access to USAID systems, including those \ncontaining classified information.45 \n114.  DOGE personnel halted certain agency payments, overruling Secretary of State \nMarco Rubio, who has also been serving as the Acting USAID Administrator.  \n115.  On January 28, Rubio issued an “Emergency Humanitarian Waiver to Foreign \nAssistance  Pause,”  to  allow  continued  payments  for  “life-saving  humanitarian  assistance \nprograms.”46  \n116.  But despite Rubio’s—as well as USAID managers’ and the White House’s—\nexpress authorization for these payments, DOGE personnel blocked the payments. 47  \n117.

Did that instead.”48 \n119.  As his X post indicates, Musk, as head of DOGE, and by his own admission, \ndirected the reduction of USAID’s workforce and freezing of funds. \n120.  Another  early  DOGE  target  was  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau \n(“CFPB”),  where  DOGE  staff  gained  access  to  systems  that  “manage  the  agency’s  human \nresources, procurement, and finance systems” and  have “taken control of the bureau’s social media \naccounts, locking out career staff.”49 \n121.

This includes messages sent on ephemeral messaging platforms.  \n182.  On information and belief, the former U.S. Digital Service set up a Slack platform \nthat was configured to ensure that the agency was able to comply with its records preservation \nobligations under FOIA and the FRA. \n183.  In February 2025, however, DOGE employees were instructed to stop using Slack \nin order to migrate communications to a platform that would be administered within the Executive \nOffice of the President.101 \n184.  Instead,  DOGE  has  used  ephemeral  messaging  platforms  such  as  Signal  and \nMattermost, an open-source alternative to Slack. \n185.  For example, the instructions the VA DOGE team received from Steve Davis, see \nsupra ¶¶ 174-76, were primarily transmitted using Signal.102 \n186.  Signal is an open-source, encrypted messaging service that allows users to send \ntext, audio, video, and picture messages to other users. \n187.  Signal includes a function that allows users to set time limits by which their sent \nmessages will disappear and be deleted from both the sender’s and recipient’s devices.103 \n188.  Upon information and belief, Signal messages are stored only on an individual’s \ndevice, with no copy or back-up of the messages retained on the Signal’s servers; this means that \n \n101 Jason Koebler & Joseph Cox, DOGE Employees Ordered to Stop Using Slack While Agency \nTransitions to a Records System Not Subject to FOIA, 404 Media (Feb. 5, 2025, 11:49 AM), \nhttps://www.404media.co/doge-employees-ordered-to-stop-using-slack-while-agency-\ntransitions-to-a-records-system-not-subject-to-foia/. \n102 See Elliot, supra n. 96. \n103 For an explanation of ephemeral messaging, see, e.g., Set and Manage Disappearing \nMessages, Signal, https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360007320771-Set-and-manage-\ndisappearing-messages; Stories, Signal, https://support.signal.org/hc/en-\nus/articles/5008009166234-Stories; Disappearing Messages with a Linked Device, Signal, \nhttps://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/5532268300186-Disappearing-Messages-with-a-\nLinked-Device.  \n3 5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 36 of 69\nSignal messages can be preserved by the individual users through screenshots or other means, but, \nonce deleted, messages may not be able to be restored or retrieved.104 \n189.

On information and belief, at least some of these Signal messages were not \npreserved before they were deleted. \n196.

This policy references \nMattermost as a type of electronic communication that is subject to the retention policy.  \nMattermost is used at Elon Musk-controlled companies like Tesla. See, e.g., Casey Newton & \nZoë Schiffer, Twitter Shut Off its Internal Slack, and Now ‘Everyone is Barely Working’, The \nVerge (Feb. 24, 2023, 9:00 AM), https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23613288/twitter-slack-\njira-outages-performance-degradation.  \n3 7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 38 of 69\n199.  On  information  and  belief,  federal  records  responsive  to  Plaintiff’s  FOIA \nrequests—including Signal and Slack communications—have already been removed or destroyed \nor may soon be.   \n200.  On  information  and  belief,  the  use  of  open-source  accounts  and  ephemeral \nmessaging  without  adequate  procedures  and  safeguards  to  retain  those  records  on  official \ngovernment recordkeeping programs emanated from DOGE leadership, including Musk and \nDavis.  \n201.  On  information  and  belief,  DOGE  leadership’s  use  of  ephemeral  messaging \nplatforms necessitates that lower-level DOGE staff also use those platforms, also without adequate \nsafeguards to retain messages on official government recordkeeping programs. \n202.  As such, the use of ephemeral messaging platforms without adequate procedures to \nretain messages on official government recordkeeping programs reflects an agency policy or \npractice. \nDOGE’s Use of Google Docs \n203.  DOGE staffers are “bypassing . . . chains of custody for official government \ndocuments by working simultaneously out of Google Docs instead of circulating single copies of \ndrafts,” with “multiple people in one Google Doc editing things simultaneously.”109 \n204.  Work product created by DOGE staffers on Google Docs and all drafts thereof are \nfederal records that must be preserved under the FRA. The FRA requires working drafts to be \nindividually preserved where they were “circulated or made available to employees, other than the \ncreator” for “approval, comment, action, recommendation, follow-up, or to communicate with \n \n109 See Ulmer et al., supra note 83.  \n3 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 39 of 69\nagency  staff  about  agency  business,”  and  “contain  unique  information,  such  as  substantive \nannotations or comments.” 36 C.F.R. § 1222.12(c). \n205.  The nature of Google Docs, and the fact that multiple DOGE staffers work in a \nsingle document simultaneously, means that draft documents are necessarily circulated or made \navailable to employees. \n206.  Furthermore, on information and belief, many draft Google Docs contain unique \ninformation, such as substantive annotations or comments. \n207.  Other uses of Google Docs include using a single shared document as a shared \nmessage pad—like a physical whiteboard on which people write notes to one another, erasing \nprevious notes along the way—as an alternative to email. \n208.  Only certain paid Google product suites have the ability to show who edited which \npart of a document.110 \n209.  Moreover, Google Docs does not necessarily save all prior versions of a document, \nbut may instead “merge [previous versions] to save storage space.”111 \n210.  On  information  and  belief,  DOGE  has  not  established  effective  controls  or \nsafeguards within its version of Google Docs to ensure that all federal records are captured and \npreserved. \n211.  Accordingly, DOGE’s use of Google Docs runs a substantial risk that federal \nrecords have been wrongfully disposed of already, because prior drafts have likely been lost, along \n \n110 Google Docs Editors Help, Find what’s changed in a file, \nhttps://support.google.com/docs/answer/190843 (stating that seeing “who changed a part of a \ndocument in Google Docs” is “available to only Google Workspace Business Standard, Business \nPlus, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, and Education Plus customers”) (last visited July 22, \n2025). \n111 Id. \n3 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 40 of 69\n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 41 of 69\n219.  Google Docs internal chats are “recorded information . . . made or received by \n[DOGE] in connection with the transaction of public business.” See 44 U.S.C. § 3301. \n220.  Chats within a Google Doc are federal records that must be preserved. \n221.  On information and belief, DOGE uses Google Docs on the instructions of DOGE \nleadership. As such, DOGE’s use of Google Docs without adequate procedures to retain messages \non official government records management programs reflects an agency policy or practice. \nDOGE’s Records Retention Policy \n222.  In a separate FOIA action against DOGE brought by American Oversight in this \nDistrict, DOGE produced a Records Retention Policy. See United States DOGE Service Records \nRetention Policy, Am. Oversight v. Dept. of Govt. Efficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Mar. \n27, 2025), ECF No. 13-2. \n223.  The Records Retention Policy is dated March 25, 2025.   \n224.  March 25 is one day after American Oversight filed a Motion for a Preservation \nOrder that asked the court to order DOGE to preserve all records responsive to the FOIA requests \nat issue in that lawsuit. Pl.’s Mot. for Preservation Order, Am. Oversight v. Dept. of Govt. \nEfficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Mar. 24, 2025), ECF No. 12. \n225.  The Records Retention Policy purports to be in accord with the PRA, not the FRA \nor FOIA. \n226.  The Records Retention Policy advises, but does not require, that DOGE employees, \n“disabl[e] auto-delete features” on messaging services like Signal. \n227.  The  policy  also  states  that  “the  easiest  way  to  comply”  with  recordkeeping \nobligations “is to use work devices for all work-related activities,” but stops short of requiring \nDOGE employees to do so. \n4 1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 42 of 69\n228.  The policy states further that some materials need not be preserved, such as “certain \nmaterials without historical value, such as notes, drafts, or similar documents that are not circulated \nor that are not created or saved for purposes of documenting the activities or deliberations of the \nAdministration,” because those materials “are not covered by the PRA.” \n229.  As such, the policy fails to require the preservation of materials mandated by the \nFRA. \nAmerican Oversight Puts DOGE and NARA on Notice of FRA Violations \n230.  On January 22, 2025, American Oversight sent a letter to Elon Musk in his capacity \nas DOGE’s apparent leader, notifying him of the likely unlawful destruction or removal of federal \nrecords protected by the FRA.114 That same day, American Oversight sent similar letters to the \nDepartments of Defense, Health and Human Services, Homeland Security, Treasury, and Veterans \nAffairs, as well as OMB and NARA, regarding the likely destruction or removal of DOGE \ncommunications.115 \n231.  To date, American Oversight has received no response from Musk or anyone else \nassociated with DOGE to the letter sent January 22. \n232.  American Oversight received a response to one of the January 22 agency letters \nfrom William Fischer, Chief Records Officer of NARA. This letter stated only that “[t]he issues \nraised in your letter are now before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia \nCircuit, see CREW v. U.S. DOGE Service, 1:25-cv-00511.

In early March 2025, a DOGE team accessed confidential data on the computer \nsystems of the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”).116 \n234.  Based on these events, a whistleblower, Daniel Berulis, a technical expert at the \nNLRB, submitted an official disclosure to Congress and the Office of Special Counsel.117  \n235.  The  DOGE  team  demanded  the  highest  level  of  access  to  NLRB  computer \nsystems—“tenant owner level” accounts “with essentially unrestricted permission to read, copy \nand alter data.”  \n236.  But the DOGE team rebuffed NLRB staff’s offer to grant such access in a manner \nthat would log DOGE activity consistent with the NLRB’s cybersecurity policies.118 \n237.  DOGE programmer Jordan Wick wrote code to access NLRB’s internal case \nmanagement system, NxGen.119 \n238.  DOGE programmers insisted that their activities not be logged.120  \n \n116 See Jenna McLaughlin, A Whistleblower’s Disclosure Details How DOGE May Have Taken \nSensitive Labor Data, NPR (Apr. 15, 2025, 5:00 AM), https://www.npr.org/2025/04/15/nx-s1-\n5355896/doge-nlrb-elon-musk-spacex-security.  \n117 Id. \n118 Id. \n119 Id. \n120 Id. \n4 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 44 of 69\n239.  While DOGE programmers were accessing the NLRB’s systems, an unusually large \namount of data exited the NLRB’s network. NLRB technical staff were sufficiently concerned that \nthey launched a formal breach investigation and sought assistance from CISA.121 \n240.  DOGE programmers deleted access logs, records of the data exfiltration, and other \nrecords of their activities from the NLRB’s computer systems.122  \n241.  Deleting access logs from a government computer system in this manner violates \nthe FRA.123 \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA Requests  \n242.  American Oversight has submitted more than 40 FOIA requests to DOGE since \nJanuary 20, 2025. \n243.  American Oversight will continue to submit FOIA requests to DOGE. \n244.  American Oversight has already filed one previous lawsuit against DOGE seeking \nto compel DOGE to produce records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests. See Am. \nOversight v. Dep’t of Gov’t Efficiency, No. 25-cv-0409 (BAH) (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025).  \n245.  DOGE’s use  of  Google  Docs  means  that  records  responsive  to  a  number  of \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests have already or may imminently be disposed of unlawfully. \n246.  Likewise, DOGE’s use of Signal and Mattermost mean that records responsive to \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests have already or may imminently be disposed of unlawfully. \n \n121 Id. \n122 Id. \n123 Id. \n4 4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 45 of 69\nAgency Dismantling FOIA Request \n247.

On April 17, 2025, American Oversight received an email response to one of the \nresubmitted requests not at issue in this lawsuit that appeared to be a blanket denial of all \n17 requests, stating: “As set forth in Executive Order 14158, Establishing and Implementing the \nPresident’s “Department of Government Efficiency,” USDS sits within the Executive Office of the \nPresident, and the USDS Administrator reports to the President’s Chief of Staff.

See supra ¶¶ 248-49. \nSteve Davis Signal Communications Request \n259.  On  June  17,  2025,  American  Oversight  submitted  a  FOIA  request  to \nadmin@DOGE.eop.gov, bearing internal tracking number USDS-25-1567, seeking the following \nrecords from January 20, 2025, through the date the search is conducted: \n1.  All email communications  (including emails, complete email chains, \ncalendar invitations, and  attachments  thereto) sent or  received  by  Steven  Davis, \nor anyone communicating on his behalf, such as an assistant or scheduler, that contain \nany of the following terms: \n \nKey Terms: \na.  Signal \nb.  “group chat” \nc. “E-meeting” \nd. “E meeting” \n \n2.  All messages sent or received by Steven Davis related to official government business \n(including complete message threads or conversations) on the messaging app Signal, \nincluding any app that can interface with Signal or otherwise borrow its technology \n(including but not limited to TeleMessage). \n \nSee Exhibit 7. \n260.  DOGE has not acknowledged receipt of this request nor otherwise communicated \nabout this request with American Oversight. \nDOGE’s Use of Signal, Mattermost, and Google Docs Violates FOIA and the FRA \n \n261.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have used Signal, without implementing \nadequate safeguards to preserve and prevent destruction of messages, to communicate about \nmatters that may otherwise have been discussed via email, to avoid creating and preserving records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests for emails.  \n4 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 53 of 69\n262.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have used Mattermost platforms, without \nimplementing  adequate  safeguards  to  preserve  and  prevent  destruction  of  messages,  to \ncommunicate about matters that may otherwise have been discussed via official government \ncommunications  platforms,  thereby  avoiding  creating  and  preserving  records  responsive  to \nAmerican Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n263.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  have  used  Google  Docs,  without \nimplementing adequate safeguards to preserve and prevent destruction of communications, to \ncommunicate about matters that may otherwise have been discussed via email, thereby avoiding \ncreating and preserving records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n264.  Upon information and belief, Defendants have used Google Docs to avoid creating \nand separately preserving individual drafts of documents with commentary and that reflect which \nindividuals created which sections, thereby avoiding creating and preserving records responsive \nto American Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n265.  Upon  information  and  belief,  Defendants  Musk,  Davis,  and  Gleason  (the \n“Individual Defendants”), in their capacities as heads of DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve \nmessages sent or received in Signal chats or to recover any that have been lost or deleted.  \n266.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve messages sent or received in Mattermost chats or to \nrecover any that have been lost or deleted. \n267.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve messages sent or received in Google Docs chats or to \nrecover any that have been lost or deleted. \n4 4 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 54 of 69\n268.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve all prior drafts of federal records produced in Google \nDocs with their commentary and reflecting which individuals contributed which sections to \ndocuments, nor taken steps to recover any prior drafts that have been lost or deleted. \n269.  Upon information and belief, the Individual Defendants, in their capacities as heads \nof DOGE, have not taken steps to preserve records in other electronic communication systems that \npermit ephemeral messaging or can be configured or used not to preserve records. \nExhaustion of FOIA Administrative Remedies  \n \n270.  As of the date of this Complaint, the DOGE Defendants have failed to: (a) notify \nAmerican Oversight of a final determination regarding any of the FOIA requests at issue here, \nincluding the scope of responsive records Defendants intend to produce or withhold and the \nreasons for any withholdings; or (b) produce the requested records or demonstrate that the \nrequested records are lawfully exempt from production. \n271.  More than 20 working days have passed since all FOIA requests at issue in this \nlawsuit were filed. \n272.  Through Defendants’ failures to respond to American Oversight’s FOIA requests \nwithin the time period required by law, American Oversight has constructively exhausted its \nadministrative remedies and seeks immediate judicial review.  \n273.  Further, as the DOGE Defendants claim not to be subject to FOIA and denied some \nof American Oversight’s FOIA requests on that ground, the DOGE Defendants have failed to \nestablish any procedures for administrative review. Thus, any attempt to administratively appeal \nthe denials would be futile and American Oversight has constructively exhausted its administrative \nremedies and seeks immediate judicial review. \n4 5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 55 of 69\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \nCount I – as to Defendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \nDOGE Records Retention Policy—Ephemeral Messaging Systems \n \n274.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n275.  Messages in Signal chats, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral \nmessaging systems responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded \ninformation . . . made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the \ntransaction of public business,” are federal records under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and \nmust be preserved and safeguarded against removal or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1), 2911, and § 3105. \nFederal records may only be alienated or destroyed through the careful process set forth in the \nFRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting forth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n276.  Individual Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably \nshould  know  that  the  communications  in  Signal,  Mattermost,  Google  Docs  chats,  or  other \nephemeral messaging system chats constitute “records” under the FRA. \n277.  The DOGE Records Retention Policy fails to require measures that would prevent \nthe automatic deletion of messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral \nmessaging system chats, which violates the Individual Defendants’ obligations under the FRA. \n278.  Through its failure to provide for measures that would prevent the deletion of \nmessages, automatic or otherwise, sent on ephemeral messaging platforms, the DOGE Records \nRetention Policy fails to provide “effective control[] over the creation and over the maintenance \nand use of records,” id. § 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of \nrecords,” id. § 3105, in violation of the Individual Defendants’ obligations under the FRA. \n4 6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 56 of 69\n279.  The formal retention policy therefore violates the FRA and its implementation by \nthe Individual Defendants is a final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in \na court of law.  \n280.  Moreover,  the  Individual  Defendants’  implementation  of  the  DOGE  Records \nRetention Policy is an agency action that is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \notherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nCount II – as to Defendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \nDOGE Records Retention Informal Policy—Ephemeral Messaging Systems \n281.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n282.  Messages in Signal chats, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, or other ephemeral \nmessaging systems responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded \ninformation . . . made or received by a Federal agency under Federal law or in connection with the \ntransaction of public business,” are federal records under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and \nmust be preserved and safeguarded against removal or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1), 2911, and § 3105. \nFederal records may only be alienated or destroyed through the careful process set forth in the \nFRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting forth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n283.  Individual Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably \nshould  know  that  the  communications  in  Signal,  Mattermost,  Google  Docs  chats,  or  other \nephemeral messaging system chats constitute “records” under the FRA. \n284.  By permitting and engaging in the use of Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats \nor other ephemeral messaging systems, without adequate measures to preserve all records in \nofficial recordkeeping systems or prevent the deletion, automatic or otherwise, of messages, to \n4 7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 57 of 69\ncommunicate  regarding  agency  business,  Defendants  have  failed  to  establish  a  records \nmanagement program providing “effective control[] over the creation and over the maintenance \nand use of records,” id. § 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of \nrecords,” id. § 3105. \n285.  The use of ephemeral messaging systems, that on information and belief lack FRA-\ncompliant retention measures, by agency heads Musk and Davis to message their subordinates \nwithin DOGE necessitates that lower-level staffers use noncompliant messaging systems and thus \nreflects an informal agency policy or practice. \n286.  The informal recordkeeping policy and practices Individual Defendants have in \nplace at DOGE—namely, the use of ephemeral messaging systems that either do not forward all \nrecords to official recordkeeping systems or are set to auto-delete messages—are inadequate, \narbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with the FRA. \n287.  Through  their  failure  to  require  measures  that  would  prevent  the  deletion  of \nmessages, automatic or otherwise, sent on ephemeral messaging platforms, Individual Defendants \nhave implemented informal recordkeeping policy and practices at DOGE that fail to provide \n“effective control[] over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. § 3102(1), \nand to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,” id. § 3105, in violation of the \nFRA. \n288.  The informal recordkeeping policy and practices therefore violate the FRA and are \nfinal agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court of law. \n289.  Moreover, the informal recordkeeping policy and practices are agency actions that \nare  arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. \n4 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 58 of 69\nCount III – as to Defendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \nFailure to Notify Archivist or Initiate Recovery Action—Ephemeral Messaging \n290.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n291.  Upon information and belief, messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats \nor other ephemeral messaging system chats have not been and are not being maintained in \naccordance with the FRA.  \n292.  Upon information and belief, messages in Signal, Mattermost, Google Docs chats, \nor other ephemeral messaging system chats responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests are \nbeing or will imminently be destroyed in contravention of the FRA.  \n293.  Individual Defendants’ failure to properly preserve federal records amounts to \nremoval of agency records from the agency itself and violates the FRA. \n294.  Individual Defendants’ failures and violations have injured American Oversight by \ncompromising federal records that may be responsive to American Oversight’s pending and future \nFOIA requests, thereby increasing the likelihood that American Oversight will be unable to obtain \nresponsive federal records now and in the future. \n295.  Each Defendant is on notice of the unlawful removal or destruction of agency \nrecords, at minimum because of their receipt of the January 22, 2025, letter from American \nOversight Chief Counsel Ron Fein. See supra ¶ 230.  \n4 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 59 of 69\n296.  Each Defendant is further on notice of the unlawful removal or destruction of \nagency records because of public reporting detailing concerns about DOGE’s recordkeeping \npractices and concerns over the wider use of Signal across the executive branch.125 \n297.  Where, as here, the actual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, deletion, \nerasure, or other destruction of records is known to Individual Defendants, each Individual \nDefendant, in their respective capacities as agency heads, has a nondiscretionary duty under the \nFRA to report the violation to the Acting Archivist. \n298.  Where, as here, the unlawful removal of records is known to Individual Defendants, \neach Individual Defendant, in their respective capacities as agency heads, has a nondiscretionary \nduty under the FRA to initiate an enforcement action through the Attorney General so that the \nalienated records can be recovered.  \n299.  Individual Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to notify \nthe Archivist of the above-described known FRA violations.  \n300.  Individual Defendants have failed to perform their nondiscretionary duties to \ninitiate an action through the Attorney General to preserve and recover the unlawfully removed \nrecords or for other redress.  \n301.  Individual Defendants’ failures to act constitute final agency actions for which there \nis no other adequate remedy in a court of law. Moreover, they are agency actions unlawfully \n \n125 See, e.g., Jason Koebler & Joseph Cox, DOGE Employees Ordered to Stop Using Slack While \nAgency Transitions to a Records System Not Subject to FOIA, 404 Media (Feb. 5, 2025, 11:49 \nAM), https://www.404media.co/doge-employees-ordered-to-stop-using-slack-while-agency-\ntransitions-to-a-records-system-not-subject-to-foia/; Maggie Miller & Amy MacKinnon, Inside \nthe Hazy, Fractured Mess of Signal Use in the Government, Politico (updated Apr. 2, 2025 2:18 \nPM), https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/02/inside-the-hazy-fractured-mess-of-signal-chats-\nin-the-government-00264466.  \n5 0 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 60 of 69\nwithheld or unreasonably delayed, and are also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \notherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \nCount IV – as to Defendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \nDOGE Records Retention Policy—Prior Versions of Google Docs \n \n302.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n303.  Prior versions of documents created in Google Docs responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded information . . . made or received by a Federal \nagency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business,” are federal \nrecords under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and must be preserved and safeguarded against \nremoval or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1) and § 3105. Federal records may only be alienated or \ndestroyed through the careful process set forth in the FRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting \nforth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n304.  Individual Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably \nshould know that prior versions of documents created in Google Docs constitute “records” under \nthe FRA. \n305.  The DOGE Records Retention Policy fails to require the preservation of all such \nprior versions of documents created in Google Docs.  \n306.  The DOGE Records Retention Policy also fails to prevent the use of Google Docs \nas a shared transient message pad because it does not require all communications to be conducted \non FRA-compliant platforms. \n307.  Through its failure to require measures that would preserve all prior versions of \ndocuments created in Google Docs, the DOGE Records Retention Policy fails to provide “effective \n5 1 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 61 of 69\ncontrol[] over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. § 3102(1), and to \n“establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,” id. § 3105. \n308.  The Individual Defendants’ implementation of the formal retention policy therefore \nviolates the FRA and is a final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court \nof law. \n309.

American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n311.  Prior versions of documents created in Google Docs responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests, like all other “recorded information . . . made or received by a Federal \nagency under Federal law or in connection with the transaction of public business,” are federal \nrecords under the FRA, 44 U.S.C. § 3301(a)(1)(A), and must be preserved and safeguarded against \nremoval or loss, see id. § 2904(c)(1), 2911, and § 3105. Federal records may only be alienated or \ndestroyed through the careful process set forth in the FRA. See 44 U.S.C. §§ 3301–3314 (setting \nforth the steps for lawfully disposing of records). \n312.  Individual Defendants, in their capacities as agency heads, know or reasonably \nshould know that prior versions of documents created in Google Docs constitute “records” under \nthe FRA. \n313.  By permitting and engaging in the use of Google Docs without adequate safeguards \nto preserve all prior versions, Individual Defendants have failed to establish a records management \n5 2 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 62 of 69\nprogram providing “effective control[] over the creation and over the maintenance and use of \nrecords,” id. § 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,” id. \n§ 3105. \n314.  DOGE staffers’ typical use of Google Docs was to, inter alia, allow multiple people \nto use the same document simultaneously and avoid recordkeeping obligations. This pattern of use \ndoes not reflect isolated instances of noncompliance with the FRA, but reflects an informal agency \npolicy or practice. \n315.  The informal recordkeeping policies and practices Individual Defendants have in \nplace at DOGE are inadequate, arbitrary, capricious, and otherwise not in accordance with the \nFRA. \n316.  Through its failure to require measures that would preserve all prior versions of \nrecords created in Google Docs, DOGE’s informal recordkeeping policies and practices fail to \nprovide “effective control[] over the creation and over the maintenance and use of records,” id. \n§ 3102(1), and to “establish safeguards against the removal or loss of records,” id. § 3105. \n317.  The Individual Defendants’ implementation of the informal recordkeeping policies \nand practices are therefore not in accordance with the FRA, and such implementation is a final \nagency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in a court of law. \n318.  Moreover, the informal recordkeeping policies and practices are an agency action \nthat is arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance with law. 5 \nU.S.C. § 706. \nCount VI – as to Defendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason  \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.,  \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \nFailure to Notify Archivist or Initiate Recovery Action—Google Docs Prior Versions \n5 3 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 63 of 69\n319.

Moreover, they are agency actions unlawfully \nwithheld or unreasonably delayed, and are also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and \notherwise not in accordance with law. 5 U.S.C. § 706. \nCount VII – as to Defendants NARA and Acting Archivist Rubio \nViolation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., \nfor declaratory and injunctive relief \n \n331.  American Oversight repeats and incorporates by reference each of the foregoing \nallegations as if fully set forth herein. \n332.  Defendants  NARA  and  Rubio,  in  his  capacity  as Acting Archivist,  have  an \nindependent nondiscretionary duty under the FRA to initiate a recovery action or action for other \nredress through the Attorney General when the agency head fails to do so.  \n5 5 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 65 of 69\n333.  Defendants NARA and Rubio have been made aware of the unlawfully alienated \nagency records because of their receipt of the January 22, 2025, letter from American Oversight \nChief Counsel Ron Fein, which was acknowledged by NARA on March 27, 2025. See supra ¶ \n232; Ex. 1. \n334.  Defendants NARA and Rubio have also been made aware of the unlawfully \nalienated agency records because of the widespread public reporting of this alienation. \n335.  Defendant Rubio, as Acting Archivist, knows or reasonably should know that \nDefendants Musk, Davis, and Gleason failed to take appropriate action to preserve and recover \nrecords from the Signal chat.  \n336.  However, Defendant Rubio has also failed to act consistent with his independent \nobligation as Acting Archivist to initiate an action for recovery or other redress. Accordingly, \nDefendants NARA and Rubio are in default of their nondiscretionary obligations under the FRA.  \n337.  This failure to act is a final agency action for which there is no other adequate \nremedy in a court of law. Moreover, it is an agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed, and is also arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, and otherwise not in accordance \nwith law. 5 U.S.C. § 706.  \nCount VIII – as to the DOGE Defendants \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nFailure to Conduct Adequate Searches for Responsive Records \n \n338.  American  Oversight  repeats  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  and \nincorporates them as though fully set forth herein.   \n339.  American Oversight properly requested records within Defendants’ possession, \ncustody, and control. \n5 6 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 66 of 69\n340.  Defendant Department of Government Efficiency has failed to promptly review \nagency  records  for  the  purpose  of  locating  those  records  that  are  responsive  to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests.  \n341.  Defendant USDS has failed to promptly review agency records for the purpose of \nlocating those records that are responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests. \n342.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization has failed to promptly \nreview agency records for the purpose of locating those records that are responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests. \n343.  Each Defendant’s failure to conduct an adequate search for responsive records \nviolates FOIA and applicable regulations.  \n344.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to injunctive and declaratory \nrelief requiring Defendants to promptly search for and produce records responsive to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests. \nCount IX – as to the DOGE Defendants \nViolation of FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552 \nWrongful Withholding of Non-Exempt Responsive Records \n \n345.  American  Oversight  repeats  the  allegations  in  the  foregoing  paragraphs  and \nincorporates them as though fully set forth herein. \n346.  American Oversight properly requested records within Defendants’ possession, \ncustody, and control. \n347.  Defendant Department of Government Efficiency is subject to FOIA and must \ntherefore release in response to a FOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful \nreason for withholding any materials within no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of \neach of American Oversight’s requests.  \n5 7 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 67 of 69\n348.  Defendant USDS is subject to FOIA and must therefore release in response to a \nFOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful reason for withholding any materials \nwithin no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of each of American Oversight’s requests.  \n349.  Defendant U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization is subject to FOIA and \nmust therefore release in response to a FOIA request any non-exempt records and provide a lawful \nreason for withholding any materials within no more than twenty (20) working days of receipt of \neach of American Oversight’s requests.  \n350.  Defendants are wrongfully withholding non-exempt agency records requested by \nAmerican Oversight by failing to produce non-exempt records responsive to American Oversight’s \nFOIA requests.  \n351.  Defendants are wrongfully withholding non-exempt agency records requested by \nAmerican Oversight by failing to segregate exempt information in otherwise non-exempt records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests.  \n352.  Defendants’ failure to provide all non-exempt responsive records violates FOIA and \napplicable regulations. \n353.  Plaintiff American Oversight is therefore entitled to declaratory and injunctive \nrelief requiring Defendants to promptly produce all non-exempt records responsive to American \nOversight’s  FOIA  requests  and  provide  Vaughn  indexes  justifying  the  withholding  of  any \nresponsive records withheld under claim of exemption. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff respectfully requests that this Court: \n(1)  Declare that messages and communications sent through the Signal and Mattermost \napplications in the course of conducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n5 8 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 68 of 69\n(2)  Declare that messages and communications sent through the Google Docs chat \nfeature in the course of conducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n(3)  Declare that prior drafts of documents created in Google Docs in the course of \nconducting agency business are agency records subject to the FRA; \n(4)  Declare that the failure to ensure such messages and communications are preserved, \nas required by 44 U.S.C. § 2911, comprises an unlawful removal of federal records in violation of \nthe FRA; \n(5)  Declare that Defendants’ formal and informal records retention policies violate the \nFRA; \n(6)  Declare that Defendants have violated their respective duties under the FRA and \nAPA; \n(7)  Order Defendants to comply with their respective duties under the FRA and APA, \nincluding by notifying the Archivist of the actual or potential unlawful removal, deletion, or \ndestruction of federal records and by referring the matter to the Attorney General to initiate \nproceedings for the recovery of unlawfully removed records and the recovery or restoration of any \ndeleted or destroyed materials to the extent possible; \n(8)  Order Defendants to preserve all materials relating to Plaintiff’s claims under the \nFRA;  \n(9)  Order Defendants to conduct a search reasonably calculated to uncover all records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests; \n(10)  Order Defendants to produce, within 20 days of the Court’s order, any and all non-\nexempt records responsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests, and Vaughn indexes of any \nresponsive records withheld under claim of exemption; \n5 9 \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01251-RC     Document 14     Filed 07/22/25     Page 69 of 69\n(11)  Enjoin Defendants from continuing to withhold any and all non-exempt records \nresponsive to American Oversight’s FOIA requests; \n(12)  Order  Defendants  to  preserve  all  records  potentially  responsive  to American \nOversight’s FOIA requests; \n(13)  Grant Plaintiff an award of attorneys’ fees and other litigation costs reasonably \nincurred in this action; and \n(14)  Grant Plaintiff any other relief this Court deems appropriate. \n \nDated: July 22, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n    /s/ David Kronig \n   David Kronig \n  D.C.
