    "summary": "<p>Several lawsuits have been brought challenging the Trump administration&rsquo;s attempt to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. This case is one; the others can be found <a href=\"../../../../search/case/?advanced_search=true&amp;special_collection=38881&amp;case_status=5069&amp;case_status=5071&amp;case_status=5074&amp;case_status=5066&amp;issue_general=5386&amp;ordering=-summary_approved_date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">here</a>.</p>\r\n<p>In this case, two organizations involved in research about education policies, practices, and methods sued the Department of Education and its Secretary. The plaintiffs challenged actions taken by the Department regarding the Institute for Education Sciences (IES) and its centers. Under the Education Sciences Reform Act (ESRA), the Department, through IES, is charged with conducting, assessing, collecting, and disseminating research about education practices and policies in the U.S. \"Through IES and its Centers, Congress sought to improve both the quantity and quality of educational data collection.\"&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On March 20, 2025, President Trump signed Executive Order 14,242, titled \"Improving Education Outcomes by Empowering Parents, States, and Communities.\" In this order, President Trump instructed the Secretary \"to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, [to] take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education.\" In keeping with this directive, the Department canceled most of IES's contracts with independent contractors that it used to collect, analyze, and publish educational data. On March 11, the Department also announced a Reduction in Force of nearly 50% of its workforce.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2025, the plaintiffs filed suit in the District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions \"will limit the availability and access of significant datasets that are needed to identify, investigate, evaluate, and improve educational outcomes.\" Furthermore, the plaintiffs alleged that the Department's actions would prevent the IES from carrying out its instructions from Congress to collect and disseminate educational data. Therefore, the plaintiffs argued that the defendant's actions exceeded statutory authority, were not in accordance with law, and were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs also claimed the actions violated the Constitution's separation of powers principles and exceeded the agency's statutory authority under ERSA. The plaintiffs asked the court to declare that the defendants had violated the APA, to enjoin the defendants from refusing to fulfill contracts or destroying any datasets in existence, and to order the defendants to reinstate cancelled contracts and a sufficient workforce to carry out the IES's duties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case was assigned to District Judge Trevor N. McFadden. On May 2, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, telling the court that any delay in granting relief would cause them irreparable harm, given the President's directives to the Department. On May 5, the defendants moved for a stay. The defendants pointed to another related case that was also assigned to Judge McFadden, Association for Education Finance and Policy v. McMahon, arguing that since the plaintiffs in both cases had moved for preliminary injunctions seeking identical relief, the court here should stay the proceedings until a decision was reached in the other case on the preliminary injunction. On May 6, Judge McFadden denied the defendants' motion for a stay. Judge McFadden said that the defendants had only argued that they would suffer hardship from having to litigate two similar cases at the same time, which does not warrant a stay. Furthermore, the judge said that comity concerns do not exist in this case, since both matters were before the same court, rather than before courts in different jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On May 19, the judge held a hearing on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion on June 3, finding that the plaintiffs were \"seeking wholesale correction of general agency operations and bundling together claims to pursue outsized relief.\" 786 F.Supp.3d 13. Rather than bringing a claim against a discrete agency action as required by the APA, the plaintiffs were challenging a programmatic decision, the reduction of workforce and services by the Department. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs were not bringing a justiciable claim under the APA, dooming their request for a preliminary injunction based on the APA.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Turning to the plaintiffs' constitutional claims, the court also found them deficient, stating that \"if every statutory compliance issue triggered separation of powers concerns, virtually all APA cases would balloon into disputes of constitutional proportions.\" Instead, the plaintiffs' constitutional claims in this case were simply statutory violation claims in disguise. Therefore, the court found that the plaintiffs failed to state a plausible claim for relief under the Constitution. Given these deficiencies, the court said the plaintiffs were unlikely to prevail on the merits of their claims and denied their request for a preliminary injunction. 2025 WL 1568301.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The plaintiffs next filed an amended complaint on July 21. The amended complaint removed many of the general allegations of illegal activity by the defendants, instead focusing on ten specific studies and datasets used by the plaintiffs. The amended complaint focused on these ten datasets, their purposes, their use by the plaintiffs, and how their use had been hindered by the defendants' actions. The plaintiffs' claims for relief follow this updated structure, arguing that the defendants' actions in ceasing to provide access to these datasets were arbitrary and capricious under the APA. Finally, the amended complaint also restructures the relief sought, seeking specific injunctions for each of the datasets.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 18, 2025, the Department filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint for a lack of subject matter jurisdiction&mdash;&ldquo;(i) Plaintiffs lack Article III standing, and (ii) Plaintiffs&rsquo; contract claims cannot be brought in this Court under the Tucker Act.&rdquo;&mdash;and failure to state a claim because &ldquo;(i) Plaintiffs fail to challenge any discrete agency action, and (ii) how the Department performs its statutory obligations is committed to sound agency discretion.&rdquo; The plaintiffs filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion on October 9.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.&nbsp;</p>",

The  Education  Sciences  Reform  Act  (“ESRA”)  requires  that  the  federal\ngovernment maintain robust educational data collection capabilities, and that the Department of \nEducation  (“the  Department”)  collect,  maintain,  analyze,  and  disseminate  high-quality  data \nthrough  its  research  initiatives. To  accomplish  these  goals,  ESRA  reorganized  the  existing \nDepartment research initiatives and established the Institute of Education Sciences (“IES”) which \nincludes the four National Centers of Research (collectively, “IES’s Centers”): the National Center \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 34\nfor Education Statistics (“NCES”), National Center for Education Evaluation (“NCEE”), National \nCenter for Education Research (“NCER”), and the National Center for Special Education Research \n(“NCSER”).   \n2.  Congress has taken no action to curtail IES’s and its Centers’ obligations under \nESRA and has instead continued to add further mandates to IES’s collection duties. In support of \nthese data collection mandates, Congress continues to appropriate hundreds of millions of dollars \nto ensure that IES and its Centers can meet their critical legal obligations.  \n3.  Despite these ongoing congressional mandates, Defendants and other officials in \nthe  Trump Administration,  through  Executive  Orders  and  the  Department  of  Government \nEfficiency (“DOGE”) initiatives, have moved swiftly to take actions that restrict the collection and \ndissemination of federal education information as part of the administration’s ultimate goal of \ndismantling the Department. \n4.  The first disruptive action resulting in the restriction of Department data took place \non February 10, 2025, when the Department cancelled over $900 million in Department contracts, \nincluding vendor contracts required to maintain and update data collected by IES and its Centers \nin accordance with congressional mandates.  \n5.  On March 11, 2025, the administration announced a Reduction in Force (“RIF”) of \nnearly fifty percent of the Department’s workforce. Due to the RIF and other actions by the \nDepartment, approximately 90% of IES’s staff was eliminated, shrinking IES to approximately \ntwenty employees, and NCES—one of the nation’s oldest statistical centers—has shrunk from \napproximately 100 employees down to three. Following the Department’s RIF and other agency \nactions related to the shuttering of the Department, IES and its Centers are no longer able to comply \nwith congressional mandates to collect, analyze, and disseminate critical datasets related to \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 34\neducation. \n6.  Where federal education data does exist, the Department has terminated academic \nresearchers’ access to this data in contravention of the congressional mandate to make IES data \npublicly available.  \n7.  Plaintiffs and their members, preeminent education scholars and measurement \nexperts, rely on data from IES’s Centers for their research on pressing educational issues, including \nthe National Assessment of Educational Progress (“NAEP”), EDFacts, National Post Secondary \nStudent Aid Survey (“NPSAS”), Educational Longitudinal Studies (“ELS”), Early Childhood \nLongitudinal Study (“ECLS”), High School Longitudinal Study (“HCLS”), and the Trends in \nInternational Mathematics and Science Study (“TIMSS”).  \n8.  This data from IES’s Centers is critical to Plaintiffs and their members’ research on \neducational inequality in access to resources, opportunities, support, and outcomes. Without this \ndata, Plaintiffs and their members cannot continue their study of educational inequality and the \npractices, programs, and policies that work to improve opportunities and outcomes for historically \nunderserved students, including Black, Latino, and Native American students; students with \ndisabilities; English language learner/multilingual learners; and socioeconomically disadvantaged \nstudents  by:  measuring  national  trends  in  education  access  and  outcomes;  ensuring  that \nmeasurement data is of the highest quality, and valid and reliable for representing disparities in \nstate  and  national  test  scores  among  demographic  groups;  and  measuring  changes  in  the \ndistribution of financial aid.  \n9.  IES’s data not only fuels Plaintiffs and their members’ research, but also technical \nassistance, federal aid calculations, grants to localities, recipients’ compliance efforts, and Census \nBureau statistics. The impending failure of IES to collect future data will have longstanding and \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 34\nfar-reaching impacts on our nation’s education system. \n10.  Not only will Defendants’ actions related to IES’s and its Centers’ data create long-\nterm, irreparable harm, these actions are in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). \nRestricting the collection, maintenance, and analysis of IES’s and its Centers’ data violates the \nAPA because it was carried out in excess of statutory authority, was arbitrary and capricious, and \nwas not in accordance with the law under ESRA. These actions are also unlawful because they \nviolate the constitutional Separation of Powers and constitute unlawful ultra vires agency action.  \n11.  This suit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against Defendants’ unlawful \nrestriction of IES’s and its Centers’ data, and against Defendants’ imminent and ongoing failure to \nmaintain and update IES’s and its Centers’ data as required by Congress. \nPARTIES \n12.  Plaintiff  National Academy  of  Education  (NAEd)  is  a  nonpartisan,  nonprofit \norganization  that  advances  high-quality  research  to  improve  education  policy  and  practice. \nFounded  in  1965,  the  NAEd  has  342  members,  including  those  in  the  United  States  and \ninternational associates, who are elected on the basis of their leading and trusted scholarship related \nto education. NAEd undertakes research studies to address pressing  educational issues  and \nadministers professional development fellowship programs to enhance the preparation of the next \ngeneration of education scholars. NAEd and its members rely on  data to study a wide variety of \npressing  educational  issues,  including  inequities  that  prevent  Black  and  other  historically \nmarginalized  students  from  having  equal  access  to  educational  opportunities.  Using  NAEd \nmember research to improve education policy and practice is integral to NAEd’s mission and \naccess to the IES data is a necessary component of this work. NAEd and its members are injured \nby Defendants’ actions restricting the collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 34\nfederal  education  data  because  Defendants’  actions  prevent  NAEd  and  its  members  from \ncompleting ongoing research, disseminating planned research, and instructing students in their \ncoursework. NAEd and its members are injured by this loss of information due to Defendants’ \nactions, and Defendants’ failure to comply with ESRA and other federal laws.  \n13.  Plaintiff National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME) is a professional \norganization founded in 1938 for individuals involved in assessment, evaluation, testing, and other \naspects of educational measurement. NCME has 1,870 members who are education researchers \nand measurement experts involved in the construction and use of standardized tests; new forms of \nassessment, including performance-based assessment; program design; and program evaluation. \nNCME aims to advance the science and scholarship of educational measurement and promote \nknowledge, understanding, and implementation of best practices in educational measurement \nthrough the publication of research and scholarly journals. NCME members include researchers; \nuniversity faculty; graduate students; test developers; and other professionals with work related to \neducation, psychology, and other testing issues and practices. Serving communities and ensuring \nthat assessment is fair and equitable for all students are essential elements of NCME's mission and \npurposes. NCME and its members are injured by Defendants’ actions restricting the collection, \nmaintenance, analysis, and dissemination of federal education data because Defendants’ actions \nprevent NCME and its members  from completing ongoing research,  disseminating planned \nresearch, and instructing students in their coursework. NCME and its members are injured by this \nloss of information due to Defendants’ actions, and Defendants’ failure to comply with ESRA and \nother federal laws. \n14.  Defendant  United  States  Department  of  Education  is  a  Cabinet  agency \nheadquartered in Washington, D.C., responsible for the oversight of federal education and civil-\n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 34\nrights  laws  and  programs,  including  the  Institute  for  Education  Sciences.  Through  ESRA, \nCongress mandates that the Department, through IES and its Centers, collect, collate, analyze, and \nreport complete statistics on the condition of American education; conduct and publish reports; \nand  review  and  report  on  education  activities  internationally.  20  U.S.C.  §§  9541–48.  The \nDepartment’s  actions,  including  its  attempted  dismantling  and  cessation  of  congressionally \nmandated work at IES and its Centers, and effectuating mass terminations of the Department’s \nstaff or cancelling vendor contracts necessary for the statutorily required collection, maintenance, \nand dissemination of educational data, are not authorized by ESRA. \n15.  Defendant Linda McMahon is the U.S. Secretary of Education and is sued in her \nofficial  capacity.  Defendant  McMahon  authorized  and  approved  the  Department’s  unlawful \ndismantling and cessation of congressionally mandated work at IES and its Centers.   \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n16.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  hear  this  case  under  28  U.S.C.  §§  1331  and \n1346(a)(2), because the matters in this controversy arise under the laws of the United States, and \nthe defendants are United States officials. See 44 § U.S.C. 33501 et seq. and 5 U.S.C. § 702, 704.  \n17.  This  Court  has  jurisdiction  to  grant  declaratory  judgment,  and  to  provide \npreliminary and permanent injunctive relief under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 57 and 65, as \nwell as 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202.  \n18.  Venue is proper in this Court under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e) because defendants \nare agencies of the United States.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  The  Creation  and  Development  of  Federal  Education  Research  Institutes  and \nCenters.  \n19.  Since  the  1860s,  the  federal  government  has  dedicated  significant  resources \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 34\ntowards the collection, analysis, and dissemination of high-quality educational data for the benefit \nof our nation’s students.1 To that end, it has worked to improve and expand educational statistical \nresearch and provide additional resources for the evaluation of the United States educational \nsystem.2 \n20.  In  1979,  Congress  passed,  and  President  Carter  signed,  the  Department  of \nEducation Organization Act (DEOA), Pub. L. 96-88, 93 Stat. 668 (1979) (codified as amended at \n20 U.S.C. §§ 3401–510), establishing the present-day Department under the supervision of a \nSecretary of Education.  \n21.  On November 5, 2002, President Bush signed H.R. 3801, which included ESRA, a \nlandmark act for the improvement of federal education research, statistics, evaluation, information, \nand dissemination. Through ESRA, Congress recommitted to prioritizing the federal government’s \nrole in educational data collection, evaluation, and dissemination.  \n22.  The DEOA created a research office in the Department, which the 2002 ESRA, an \nact “to provide for improvement of Federal education research, statistics, evaluation, information \nand dissemination,” reconstituted as IES, an independent research division. See Pub. L. 107-279; \n20 U.S.C. §§ 9501–84.  \n23.  In  creating  IES,  Congress  established  the  division’s  mission  as  “expanding \nfundamental  knowledge  and  understanding  of  education  from  early  childhood  through \npostsecondary study, in order to provide parents, educators, students, researchers, policymakers, \nand the general public with reliable information about— (A) the condition and progress of \neducation in the United States, including early childhood education; (B) educational practices that \n \n1 Thomas D.

IES has a congressional mandate to “directly or through grants, contracts, or \ncooperative agreements . . . (1) conduct and support scientifically valid research activities, \nincluding basic research and applied research, statistics activities, scientifically valid education \nevaluation, development, and wide dissemination; (2) widely disseminate the findings and results \nof scientifically valid research in education; (3) promote the use, development, and application of \nknowledge gained from scientifically valid research activities; (4) strengthen the national capacity \nto conduct, develop, and widely disseminate scientifically valid research in education; (5) promote \nthe coordination, development, and dissemination of scientifically valid research in education \nwithin the Department and the Federal Government; and (6) promote the use and application of \nresearch and development to improve practice in the classroom.” See id. § 9512. \n25.  In carrying out these mandates, Congress requires IES to establish and operate four \nresearch centers—NCES, NCEE, NCER, and NCSER—to maintain specialized federal education \ndata and information. See id. §§ 9511(c), 9531–34, 9541–48, 9561–64, 9567–67b.  \n26.  IES is the statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the Department. IES was \ncreated “to provide scientific evidence on which to ground education practice and policy and to \nshare this information in formats that are useful and accessible to educators, parents, policymakers, \nresearchers, and the public.”3 \n \n3 Inst. of Educ. Sci., About IES, https://ies.ed.gov/about (last visited Apr. 21, 2025). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 34\n27.  NCES is “the federal statistical agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and \nreporting data on the condition of U.S. education—from early childhood to adult education—to \nhelp improve student outcomes.”4  \n28.  Through IES and its Centers, Congress sought to improve both the quantity and \nquality of educational data collection, by increasing not only the amount of data collected but also \nby setting high standards and processes for review of the research that relied on this data.5 Across \nIES and its Centers’ data-collection programs, utilizing empirical research methods and peer \nreview are major requirements of ESRA.  \n29.  Along with this improvement in the quantity and quality of educational data, \nCongress charged IES with ensuring that the research findings uncovered through IES data would \nbe widely distributed to researchers, schools, educators, parents, students, and other public \nstakeholders.6  An  example  of  this  required  dissemination  is  the  congressionally  mandated \nstatistical report on the conditions and progress of education in the U.S. that NCES is required to \nproduce annually. See 20 U.S.C. § 9545.  \n30.  Congress requires NCES to create the NAEP, also known as “the Nation’s Report \nCard.” See id. § 9621. NCES is required to collect and report NAEP data and ensure that it is \npublicly available in a timely manner following official reporting, and in such a way that facilitates \nfurther research. See id.  \n31.  As stated by NCES on its official website, “[s]ince 1867, NCES has been the federal \nstatistical agency responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data on the condition of U.S. \n \n4 Nat’l Ctr. for Educ.

To achieve this mission, NCES collects and produces \ndata in many ways including “from state reports, direct student assessments, longitudinal studies, \ninternational surveys, postsecondary institutions, adult surveys, and synthesizing data from federal \nsources.”8 \n32.  As noted on NCES’s official website, NCES has a “Congressional mandate to \ncollect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of American education; \nconduct and publish reports; and review and report on education activities internationally.”9 See \n20 U.S.C. §§ 9541–48.  \n33.  Congress has made explicit through statutory provisions in ESRA that NCES’s \nmandate requires NCES to collect, compile, and disseminate statistics on topics including: (A) \nstate and local education reform activities; (B) state and local early childhood school readiness \nactivities;  (C)  student  achievement  in,  at  a  minimum,  the  core  academic  areas  of  reading, \nmathematics, and science at all levels of education; (D) secondary school completions, dropouts, \n \n7 Id.  \n8 Id.  \n9 Nat’l Ctr. for Educ.

See id. § \n9543. \n34.  This congressional mandate also requires NCES to collect, analyze, cross-tabulate, \nand  report  “information  by  gender,  race,  ethnicity,  socioeconomic  status,  limited  English \nproficiency,  mobility,  disability,  urban,  rural,  suburban  districts,  and  other  population \ncharacteristics,  when  such  disaggregated  information  will  facilitate  educational  and  policy \ndecisionmaking.” See id. § 9543(a)(3).

IES datasets include those that are collected, analyzed, and reported through NAEP, \nEDFacts, NPSAS, ELS, TIMSS, and the What Works Clearinghouse.   \n42.  ESRA  requires  that  the  NAEP  measure  “student  academic  achievement  and \nreporting of trends in such achievement in reading, mathematics” and other subjects; ensure that \nthe measurement occurs by using a methodology that is designed to produce “valid and reliable” \nresults, that are based on “widely accepted professional standards;” and that the results are publicly \ndisseminated. See id. §§ 9622(b)(1), 9622(e)(2)(A), 9622(c)(1)(A). The next round of NAEP \nassessments is due to occur in January 2026. \n43.  The NPSAS examines characteristics of students in postsecondary education, with \na special focus on how they finance their education and was designed to fulfill the requirements of \n20 U.S.C. § 1015.

The  Trump  administration  has  been  clear  about  its  goal  of  abolishing  the \nDepartment since before President Trump’s election. President Trump stated in a September 2023 \ncampaign video, “One thing I’ll be doing very early in the administration is closing up the \nDepartment of Education in Washington, D.C.”18 \n49.  Defendant Secretary McMahon shares President Trump’s goal of shuttering the \nDepartment, stating during her confirmation process that the bureaucracy in Washington should be \n“abolished.”19 Once in office, Secretary McMahon described her work as part of “the Department \nof Education’s final mission.”20 \n50.  On March 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing the \nSecretary of Education to dismantle the Department.21 According to this Order, the Secretary shall, \nto the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, “take all necessary steps to facilitate the \nclosure of the Department of Education.” The Order also directs the Secretary to ensure that entities \nreceiving federal assistance “terminate illegal discrimination obscured under the label ‘diversity, \nequity, and inclusion.’” \n51.

Without these contracts, IES and its Centers do not have \nthe resources to collect, analyze, publish, and maintain with integrity for use the federal education \ndata in keeping with ESRA.  \n54.  Despite the necessity of these contracts to the proper legal functioning of IES and \nits Centers, on February 10, 2025, DOGE announced the cancellation of most IES and its Centers’ \ncontracts, constituting over $900 million in contracts.22 The X (formerly Twitter) social media \naccount for DOGE has since posted information regarding the cancellation of about ninety IES \ncontracts, some of which are critical to the basic functioning of IES and to the realization of many \nof IES’s congressional mandates.23 \n55.  Notable examples of contract terminations that will obstruct IES’s ability to uphold \ncongressional mandates include: (1) two contracts for the NPSAS; (2) contracts necessary to the \n \n22 Ryan Quinn & Katherine Knott, $900M in Institute of Education Sciences Contracts Axed, \nInside Higher Ed (Feb. 12, 2025), https://www.insidehighered.com/news/faculty-\nissues/research/2025/02/12/900m-institute-education-sciences-contracts-axed; Jonaki Mehta & \nCory Turner, Trump Targets Education Department Research Arm in Latest Cuts, NPR (Feb. 10, \n2025), https://www.npr.org/2025/02/10/nx-s1-5292444/trump-musk-education-department-\nschools-students-research-cuts. \n23 Department of Government Efficiency (@DOGE), X/Twitter (Feb. 10, 2025, 7:43 PM ET), \nhttps://x.com/DOGE/status/1889113011282907434. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 17 of 34\nCommon Core of Data and the Private School Survey, surveys necessary for the completion of the \ncongressionally required NAEP and EDFacts as well as for the distribution of roughly $16 billion \nin federal Title I funding for low-income children; (3) the contract for the completion of the \nNational Assessment of Adult Education, which IES is required to conduct under section 242 of \nthe Adult Education and Family Literacy Act (AEFLA), 29 U.S.C. § 3332(b)(3)(6); (4) contracts \nnecessary for the creation of the Condition of Education, an annual NCES report statutorily \nrequired by ESRA, 20 U.S.C. § 9545(b); (5) contracts through which IES complies with the \ndissemination requirements under ERSA including contracts for the DATALAB online platform \nand for the What Works Clearinghouse; (6) contracts for peer review of grants and research \nrequired for compliance with the requirements of 20 U.S.C. §§ 9520 and 9576(c); (7) contracts for \nthe TIMSS, Teaching and Learning International Survey (“TALIS”), and other international \nsurveys  and  analyses  through  which  NCES  meets  statutory  requirements  to  acquire  and \ndisseminate data on educational activities and student achievement in the United States compared \nto  foreign  nations;  (8) contracts  through  which  NCES  completes  congressionally  mandated \nlongitudinal data collections, including the High School and Beyond Survey and the Early \nChildhood Longitudinal Study; and (9) contracts for statutorily required Regional Educational \nLaboratories to conduct their statutorily mandated work. \n56.  Following the cancellation of these contracts and others necessary for IES and its \nCenters to fulfill statutory obligations, the Department has failed to replace these contracts or in \nany meaningful way mitigate the damage caused by these cancellations.  \n57.  The Department’s policies regarding these contract terminations will not only lead \nto failures to uphold congressional mandates with regards to future data but may also result in the \ndestruction of existing federal education data required of IES and its Centers.  \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 18 of 34\n58.  Without these contracts, IES and its Centers will not be able to hold up numerous \ncongressional mandates, and the resulting loss of data, as well as the failure to collect future data, \nwill cause irreparable harm to Plaintiffs NAEd and NCME, and their members.  \n2.  The Department’s Reduction in Force. \n59.  On March 11, 2025, the Department announced a RIF of nearly 50% of its \nworkforce.24 \n60.  These cuts have been particularly significant at IES, reducing its workforce from \naround 186 employees down to twenty, 25 with NCES, drastically shrinking from approximately \n100 employees down to three.26 \n61.  These terminated employees lost access to physical IES and its Centers’ facilities \non March 11, 2025, and had only limited IT access until March 21, 2025. This limited access did \nnot allow IES and its Centers' employees to contact any external contractors, and so the soon-to-\nbe terminated employees had no way to transition or protect the contractor-maintained data for \nwhich IES and its Centers are statutorily responsible. \n62.  Upon information and belief, only three contracting officer representatives are left \nat NCES, a staff too small to oversee even the select contracts that remain in force, let alone to \nrecontract for the cancelled contracts that IES and its Centers are statutorily required to replace or \n \n24 U.S. Dep’t of Educ, supra note 20. \n25 Jill Barshay, Chaos and Confusion as the Statistics Arm of the Education Department is \nReduced to a Skeletal Staff of 3, Hechinger Rep.

Due to NCES’s drastically shrunken workforce, it no longer can collect, analyze, \nand disseminate critical datasets, including the NAEP, EDFacts, NPSAS, ELS, and TIMSS. The \ncollection of these datasets involves measuring hundreds of indicators across all school districts \nacross the country. Ordinarily, they require hundreds of Department employees and contractors to \ncomplete.  \n64.  The significant RIF guarantees that IES and its Centers will not be able to uphold \ntheir congressional mandates to not only collect data, but also to ensure that datasets comprise \nvalid and reliable measurements of district, state, and national achievement data and trends that \nmeet high methodological standards. See id. § 9622(b)(2).27  \n65.  IES’s and its Centers’ RIF does not excuse them from their congressional mandates \nto collect, analyze, and disseminate high-quality federal education data. Failure to uphold these \ncongressional mandates will irreparably harm Plaintiffs and their researcher members. \n3.  The Department Has Limited the Availability of and Access to Important \nDatasets. \n66.  The Department’s actions, with regards to the contract terminations and the RIF as \ndescribed above, will limit the availability and access of significant datasets that are needed to \nidentify, investigate, evaluate and improve educational outcomes. \n67.  These datasets have no comparators. Currently, no alternative public or private \nentity has the infrastructure or resources necessary to collect, analyze, and disseminate this type of \ndata.  \n68.  Furthermore, the Department has significantly limited researchers’ access to and \nuse of restricted-use data. Educational researchers, including Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s \n \n27 See also Nat’l Ctr for Educ. Stat., supra note 4. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 20 of 34\nmembers, access and rely upon two categories of IES and its Centers’ data. The first is “public-use \ndata,” which is aggregated and available to the general public. The second is “restricted-use data,” \nwhich contains more granular, individually identifiable information.  \n69.  To  access  restricted-use  data,  a  researcher  must  be  a  member  of  a  qualified \norganization. Qualified members may access restricted-use data through either a “physical” or a \n“remote” data license. Through a physical data license, the researcher will receive a CD-ROM for \ndata that must be accessed in a secure facility called a “cold room,” on a standalone desktop \ncomputer disconnected from the Internet. The remote data license provides access to restricted-use \ndata through a secure online platform.  \n70.  On February 10, 2025, the Department announced that all remote restricted-use \ndata licenses would be terminated effective June 1, 2025, and that it would no longer accept new \napplications. In communications with remote restricted-use data license holders about these \nterminations, IES acknowledged that the terminations may cause difficulties for their educational \nresearch.  \n71.  To share research or analysis informed by restricted data, researchers holding a \nrestricted data license must first obtain IES permission through a disclosure risk review process, \nwhich typically takes five to ten business days. On February 14, 2025, IES informed license \nholders that these disclosure risk reviews may be delayed due to recent reductions in resources.  \n72.  NCES data users received similar communications from the National Science \nFoundation on March 31, 2025, stating first that license renewals and disclosure reviews would be \npaused, and later clarifying that disclosure reviews would continue but that all new and existing \nrequests would likely be delayed.  \n73.  Without access to existing and future federal education data, both public-use and \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 21 of 34\nrestricted-use, Plaintiffs and their member researchers will not be able to carry out vital academic \nresearch, some of which is ongoing and, without continued access to this data, likely to result in a \nwaste of  vast institutional resources, including government grants. Moreover, without these \nresearch results, researchers and the communities they serve will not know what pedagogies are \nworking to support student learning. \nC.  The Department’s Actions Harm Plaintiffs.  \n74.  The  relationship  between  education  researchers  and  federal  education  data \ncollection is symbiotic and mutually beneficial. Education researchers cannot complete their \nresearch without access to federal education data, which is unavailable from any other sources. In \nturn, Congress considers these researchers’ work, including their expertise on research design and \nmethodology, when preparing education data, policymaking, and determining the continued role \nof IES and its Centers. \n75.   The collection and analysis of data is also essential for creating and maintaining \nvalid and reliable educational assessments. Disruptions to the collection of educational assessment \ndata threaten the quality and dependability of the assessments themselves.28  Congress intends for \nthis education research done by Plaintiffs and their members to be available, including through the \nWhat Works Clearinghouse, to inform educational practices by policymakers, state and district \nleaders, and educators to best support all students’ learning. \n76.  Policymakers,  state  and  district  leaders,  teachers,  students,  parents,  and \ncommunities also rely on education researchers and experts to facilitate their understanding of \nIES’s vast data repository and communicate the implications of IES data to improve education \n \n28 Am.

Ass’n, & Nat’l Council on Measurement in Educ., \nStandards for Educational and Psychological Testing (2014), \nhttps://www.testingstandards.net/uploads/7/6/6/4/76643089/standards_2014edition.pdf. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 22 of 34\npolicies and practices, as well as schools’ teaching and learning. This relationship is of paramount \nimportance to the success of the U.S. educational system, a fact that Congress continues to \nacknowledge through legislation and appropriations. \n77.  IES data is particularly vital for researchers who specialize in studying how to \ncreate fair and just educational outcomes for Black, Latino, and Native American students; \nstudents with disabilities; English language learner/multilingual learners and socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged students and communities. \n78.  For example, Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members rely on EDFacts and NAEP \nfor their work on the Educational Opportunity Project, which is a clearinghouse for national \neducational test score data. The Educational Opportunity Project uses NAEP and EDFacts data to \ncreate a publicly available national database of academic performance for every school district and \nschool in the country. It allows anyone to review data on a wide range of metrics, including learning \nloss following the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of neighborhood segregation on student \nachievement, and student performance in reading and math.  \n79.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as those \nmade available through NAEP and EDFacts, or those that enable researchers to answer the same \nquestions with the same accuracy and scope. Therefore, without the continued collection, analysis, \nand dissemination of NAEP and EDFacts data, Plaintiffs’ members cannot continue their work on \nthis groundbreaking project.  \n80.  Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members also rely on the NPSAS to analyze the \ndistribution of federal financial aid to assess whether it is reaching the most disadvantaged \nstudents. For example, one NAEd member plans to study how the distribution of financial aid \nshifted after the passage of the FAFSA Simplification Act, including whether there were changes \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 23 of 34\nin the numbers or demographics of students applying for financial aid.  \n81.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as the \nNPSAS and that enable researchers to answer the same questions with the same accuracy and \nscope. Therefore, without the continued collection, analysis, and dissemination of the NPSAS, \nPlaintiffs’ members cannot continue their work. \n82.  Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members rely on the ECLS for their work on \ntracking student performance in kindergarten and primary school. For example, NAEd’s members \nhave used the ECLS to analyze and track trends in early childhood education. One NAEd member, \nalong with other researchers, plans to use the latest results of the ECLS, which are due to be \ndisseminated in early 2026.  \n83.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as the \nECLS and that enable researchers to answer the same questions with the same accuracy and scope. \nTherefore, without the continued collection, analysis and dissemination of the ECLS, Plaintiffs’ \nmembers cannot continue their work. \n84.  Plaintiffs  NAEd’s  and  NCME’s  members  rely  on  NCEE’s  “What  Works \nClearinghouse” and have been contracted to improve future data collection of this dataset to ensure \nadherence to professional standards in educational testing and measurement and to evaluate how \nto improve testing standards.  \n85.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as the \nWhat Works Clearinghouse and that enable researchers to answer the same questions with the same \naccuracy and scope. Without the continued collection, analysis, and dissemination of this dataset, \nPlaintiffs’ members cannot continue their work.  \n86.  Plaintiffs  NAEd’s  and  NCME’s  members  rely  on  the  National  Household \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 24 of 34\nEducation Survey (NHES). This survey, produced by NCES, is the only nationally representative \ndata on home learning environments. One NAEd member uses the NHES to support their analysis \nof early-learning environments and experiences for children aged 3-5. \n87.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as the \nNHES and that enable researchers to answer the same questions with the same accuracy and scope. \nWithout the continued collection, analysis, and dissemination of this dataset, Plaintiffs’ members \ncannot continue their work.  \n88.  Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members also rely on NAEP’s National Indian \nEducation Study (NIES) to analyze the academic achievement of Native American students in \npublic, private, Department of Defense, and Bureau of Indian Education funded schools. For \nexample, one NAEd member uses the NAEP data and the NIES survey to assess how Native \nAmerica students, across different contexts, are doing on assessments in ELA and mathematics, in \nconjunction with other critical data gained from NIES including school environment, presence or \nabsence of Native teachers (known in research to have a profound influence on student engagement \nand outcomes), and the extent to which the Native language and culture are integrated into \ncurricula. Using this data, the NAEd member can evaluate local pedagogical interventions on test \nscores as well as on high school graduation, college/university matriculation, and graduation rates. \n89.  There are no comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics as the \nNIES and that enable researchers to answer the same questions with the same accuracy and scope. \nTherefore, without the continued collection, analysis, and dissemination of the NIES, Plaintiffs’ \nmembers cannot continue their work. \n90.  Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members rely on EDFacts for detailed school-by-\ngrade level data on the academic performance of students of various sociodemographic groups, \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 25 of 34\nincluding Black, Latino, and Native American students, students with disabilities, and English \nlanguage learner/multilingual learners. \n91.  Plaintiffs  NAEd’s  and  NCME’s  members  also  rely  on  NAEP  data  to  enable \ncomparisons of school-level and district-level academic performance across states that are accurate \nfor students of various sociodemographic groups, including Black, Latino, and Native American \nstudents, students with disabilities, and English language learner/multilingual learners. \n92.  Plaintiffs NAEd’s and NCME’s members rely on Department datasets, including \nthe NAEP and NPSAS, in their instruction and coursework as education professors. Each year, \nthese members expect to utilize the most up-to-date datasets to instruct their students on current \ntrends in federal education and on how to ensure that data collection occurs in a methodologically \nsound manner. They also require their students to use these data sets to conduct analysis for their \ncoursework. \n93.  Plaintiffs  NAEd  and  NCME  also  rely  on  Department  datasets  to  perform \neducational research in service of their missions.  \n94.  As described above, Defendants have cancelled contracts impacting the collection, \nanalysis and dissemination of the NAEP, EDFacts, NPSAS, ELS, TIMSS, and What Works \nClearinghouse. Because of these cancellations, the Department is unable to collect, analyze, and \ndisseminate these datasets in accordance with its statutory mandates, and Plaintiffs and their \nmembers will be unable to obtain and utilize these datasets.  \n95.  As described  above,  Defendants indefinitely delayed their processing  of new \nrestricted-use licenses. Because of this delay, the Department is not able to provide these datasets \nto Plaintiffs and their members. \n96.  Further, because of the significant reduction in force across IES, Department \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 26 of 34\ndatasets, including the NAEP, NPSAS, ELS, TIMSS, and What Works Clearinghouse, cannot be \ncollected in accordance with the highest methodological standards and in a manner that is valid \nand reliable.   \n97.  The unavailability of a wide range of IES datasets severely impairs Plaintiffs and \ntheir members’ ability to perform educational research and teach courses at their academic \ninstitutions. Without updated federal education data, Plaintiffs and their members cannot continue \nto measure and analyze trends in education outcomes; study which pedagogies are effective, fair, \nand unbiased; arm policymakers, states and districts, educators, students, parents, and communities \nwith current information about proven methods for improving student learning and education \noutcomes; or keep the public informed about our national education system.  \n98.  Without redress for Defendants’ actions, Plaintiffs and their members’ educational \nresearch, and their contributions towards improving our educational system, will grind to a halt.  \n99.  Not only will Plaintiffs and their members be harmed by their inability to complete \ntheir research, the students that make up the subject of their research will also be harmed. Without \naccess to this unique federal data, Plaintiffs and their members will not be able to study the \neducational outcomes of Black, Latino, and Native American students, students with disabilities, \nEnglish language learner/multilingual learners, and socioeconomically disadvantaged students. \nFurther, Defendants are the only source of data for educational outcomes based on the demographic \ngroups of students such as Native American students, and there are no other datasets available to \nresearchers studying related demographic educational disparities. \n100.  If researchers are not able to study educational disparities based on race, ethnicity, \nsocioeconomic status, limited English proficiency, mobility, disability, urban, rural, suburban \ndistricts, gender, and other population characteristics, it will not be possible to create effective \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 27 of 34\npolicies for addressing these disparities and closing any achievement gaps.  \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I  \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706 (2)(C) \nExceeds Statutory Authority  \n101.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  allegation  of  the  prior \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n102.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found \nto be . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(C). \n103.  Defendants’ conduct, as described above, constitutes final agency action.  \n104.  Through ESRA, Congress mandates that the Department, through IES and its \nCenters, collect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of American \neducation;  conduct  and  publish  reports;  and  review  and  report  on  education  activities \ninternationally. 20 U.S.C. §§ 9541–48. ESRA further requires that all IES data remain available to \nthe public through online channels. See id. § 9574. \n105.  ESRA does not authorize Defendants to gut IES and its Centers or to disrupt their \ndata collection, maintenance, and dissemination activities. See e.g., Parents Involved in Cmty. \nSchs. v. Seattle Sch. Dist. No. 1, 551 U.S. 701, 745 (2007). \n106.  Only Congress has the authority to amend or repeal this statute.  \n107.  Defendants lack authority to dismantle or otherwise halt congressionally mandated \nwork at IES and its Centers, in whole or in part, including by effectuating mass terminations of the \nDepartment’s staff or cancelling vendor contracts necessary for the statutorily required collection, \nmaintenance, and dissemination of educational data, including but not limited to data collected, \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 28 of 34\nanalyzed,  and  reported  by  NAEP,  EDFacts,  NPSAS,  ELS,  TIMSS,  and  the  What  Works \nClearinghouse. \n108.  Plaintiffs have been injured by Defendants’ conduct and have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \nCOUNT II \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nArbitrary and Capricious \n109.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  allegation  of  the  prior \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n110.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found \nto be . . . arbitrary, capricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n111.  Defendants’ conduct, as described above, constitutes final agency action.  \n112.  Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious in that Defendants failed to provide \nany explanation for the dismantling of IES and its Centers, or for the resulting restriction and \nabandonment of IES and its Centers’ data, and in that Defendants failed to consider the significant \nharms flowing from the restriction of and failure to continue to collect this data.   \n113.  Defendants failed to provide any reasoned explanation for their departure from the \nDepartment’s past practice of maintaining IES and its Centers’ data and the staff and contracts \nnecessary to support the collection, maintenance, and analysis of that data. Defendants failed to \nconsider  the  impact  of  mass  terminations  on  IES  and  its  Centers’  ability  to  carry  out \ncongressionally mandated research collection, analysis, and dissemination. Nor did Defendants \narticulate a reasoned explanation for these mass terminations in light of these congressionally \nmandated requirements.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 29 of 34\n114.  Defendants likewise failed to provide any reasoned explanation for effectuating \nterminations and contract cancellations that will disrupt access to critical and statutorily mandated \ndatasets, collected by IES and its Centers, including, but not limited, to those collected, analyzed, \nand reported through NAEP, EDFacts, NPSAS, ELS, and the What Works Clearinghouse.   \n115.  Despite congressional mandates and risk of irreparable informational injury to \nPlaintiffs  and  their  members,  and  others  who  rely  on  these  statutorily  mandated  datasets, \nDefendants did not consider alternative action or offer a reasoned explanation for their chosen \ncourse of action.  \n116.  Defendants have also failed to consider the reliance interests of students, families, \nschools, states, colleges and universities, and other entities that depend on the effective operations \nof IES and its Centers to operate and to comply with federal laws, including civil rights laws. \n117.  In failing to provide a reasoned explanation or consider alternative actions to the \ndestruction of IES and its Centers and their ability to collect data, the Defendants’ actions are \narbitrary and capricious. \n118.  Plaintiffs have been injured by Defendants’ conduct and have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \nCOUNT III  \nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A) \nNot in Accordance with Law  \n119.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  allegation  of  the  prior \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n120.  Under the APA, a court shall “hold unlawful and set aside agency action . . . found \nto be . . . not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 30 of 34\n121.  Defendants’ conduct, as described above, constitutes final agency action.  \n122.  Defendants’ actions are contrary to law as set out in ESRA. IES and its Centers are \ncreated by ESRA and cannot be abolished, dismantled, or closed by the President or Secretary. \nThat is equally true whether this closure is accomplished by mass firings of IES and its Centers’ \nemployees or by any other means. Thus, Defendants’ dismantlement of IES and its Centers is \ncontrary to the ESRA, which created the IES, and its Centers, in order to \"expand[ ] fundamental \nknowledge and understanding of education . . . in order to provide parents, educators, students, \nresearchers, policymakers, and the general public with reliable information.” 20 U.S.C. § 9511.   \n123.  Defendants’ actions to debilitate IES and its Centers—including, but not limited to, \nthose actions which obstruct the creation and dissemination of datasets created by and made \navailable through NAEP, EDFacts, NPSAS, ELS, and the What Works Clearinghouse—are in \ncontravention with congressional directives requiring federal collection, analysis, and public \ndissemination of educational data. \n124.  Plaintiffs have been injured by Defendants’ conduct and have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \nCOUNT IV  \nU.S. Const. art. I, §§ 1, 4 \nViolation of Separation-of-Powers Doctrine  \n125.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  allegation  of  the  prior \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n126.  The Constitution authorizes private plaintiffs “to sue to enjoin unconstitutional \nactions by state and federal officers.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 \n(2015). The claim “is the creation of courts of equity, and reflects a long history of judicial review \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 31 of 34\nof illegal executive action, tracing back to England.” Id.  \n127.  “The President’s power, if any, to issue [an] order must stem either from an act of \nCongress or from the Constitution itself.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, \n585 (1952). The President acts at the lowest ebb of his power if he acts contrary to the expressed \nor implied will of Congress. Id. at 637 (Jackson, J., concurring). \n128.  The Constitution assigns to Congress the power to dismantle federal agencies. \nNowhere does ESRA or any other statute provide that Defendants, or any executive officer or \nagency, can engage in the dismantling of the Department or cessation of work at IES and its Centers \nthat is mandated by Congress. Neither Defendants nor the Executive has the authority to repeal \nESRA or any statutes which govern IES and its Centers’ activities.  \n129.  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  Constitution’s  separation  of  powers  because \nDefendants have no authority to dismantle the Department through the restriction, destruction, and \nabandonment of IES and its Centers’ data. \n130.  Defendants’  actions  usurp  Congress’s  legislative  authority  and  violate  the \nConstitution’s separation of powers. \n131.  Plaintiffs have been injured by Defendants’ conduct and have no adequate remedy \nat law. \nCOUNT V  \nESRA \nUltra Vires Agency Action \n132.  Plaintiffs  repeat  and  incorporate  by  reference  each  allegation  of  the  prior \nparagraphs as if fully set forth herein. \n133.  Through ESRA, Congress mandates that the Department, through IES and its \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 32 of 34\nCenters, collect, collate, analyze, and report complete statistics on the condition of American \neducation;  conduct  and  publish  reports;  and  review  and  report  on  education  activities \ninternationally. 20 U.S.C. §§ 9541–48. ESRA further requires that all IES data remain available to \nthe public through online channels. See id. § 9574. \n134.  By ignoring its clear obligations under ESRA and disrupting IES’s and its Centers’ \ndata collection, maintenance, and dissemination activities, Defendants have acted ultra vires. \nDefendants’ actions are therefore unlawful and should be enjoined.  \n135.  Plaintiffs have been injured by Defendants’ conduct and have no adequate remedy \nat law.  \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court enter a judgment against \nDefendants and award Plaintiffs the following relief: \n136.  Declare that Defendants have violated the APA by:  \na.  incapacitating IES and its Centers through terminating nearly 90% of IES staff, \nmaking it impossible for IES and its Centers to uphold their statutory mandates \nregarding the collection and dissemination of the highest quality educational \ndata; and  \nb.  cancelling contracts necessary for IES and its Centers to gather, maintain, \nanalyze, and disseminate educational data as mandated by Congress; \n137.  Order Defendants to expeditiously, within thirty days of the Court’s order, to \nreinstate the cancelled contracts or, where another contractor could provide equivalent services, to \npromptly re-bid the contracts, soliciting new contracts to carry out the research and data activities \ncovered by the cancelled contracts; \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 33 of 34\n138.  Enjoin  Defendants  from  allowing  Defendants,  their  employees,  agents  or \nindependent contractors, from destroying datasets, including by cancelling or otherwise failing to \nfulfill vendor contracts, where doing so would deny the public timely access to educational data \nwhich Congress has mandated IES collect and disseminate; \n139.  Require Defendants to restore sufficient employee positions at IES and its Centers \nto ensure Department compliance with congressional and statutory mandates, including those \npositions necessary to ensure that, within a timely manner, IES and its Centers can: \na.  properly oversee all necessary independent contractors, \nb.  grant and renew restricted-use data licenses; and   \nc.  complete disclosure risk reviews for license holders;  \n140.  An order requiring all Defendants to pay Plaintiffs’ reasonable costs, expenses, and \nattorneys’ fees; and  \n141.  Any and all additional relief that Plaintiffs request and this Court deems just and \nproper.   \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 34 of 34\nDated: April 24, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nAmy I.

Compl.”) in full pursuant to Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure (“Rules”) 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6).  \nINTRODUCTION  \nPlaintiffs,  two  membership-based  associations,  ask  the  Court  to  micromanage  the \nDepartment’s Institute of Education Sciences (the “Institute”).  Plaintiffs bring claims under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”) seeking to set aside the Institute’s termination of contracts \nunder the guise that those decisions may impact the data and information upon which Plaintiffs \nand their members rely. \nAs this Court already recognized when it denied Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary \ninjunction, such judicial micromanagement is an overreach without legal basis.  Permitting these \nclaims to proceed would entangle the Court in judicial review, eliminating discretion entrusted to \nthe Secretary to run the Department’s day-to-day operations.  Instead of the Executive Branch \nfaithfully  executing  the  laws  of  Congress,  substantial  aspects  of  a  cabinet-level  agency’s \noperations would instead be put under the control of this Court.   \nThis Court should dismiss the Amended Complaint in full for several independent reasons.  \nFirst, the Court should dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction because (i) Plaintiffs \nlack Article III standing, and (ii) Plaintiffs’ contract claims cannot be brought in this Court under \nthe Tucker Act.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1).  Second, the Court should dismiss this case for failure \nto state a claim because (i) Plaintiffs fail to challenge any discrete agency action, and (ii) how the \nDepartment performs its statutory obligations is committed to sound agency discretion.  See Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  Defendants respectfully request the Court grant this motion and dismiss this \ncase in its entirety. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 10 of 35\nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nThe Department was established as part of the Department of Education Organization Act. \nPub. L. No. 96-88, 93 Stat. 668 (1979). The purpose of the Department is principally  \n(1) to strengthen the Federal commitment to ensuring access to equal educational \nopportunity for every individual; (2) to supplement and complement the efforts of \nStates, the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States, the private \nsector, public and private educational institutions, public and private nonprofit \neducational research institutions, community-based organizations, parents, and \nstudents  to  improve  the  quality  of  education;  (3)  to  encourage  the  increased \ninvolvement of the public, parents, and students in Federal education programs; (4) \nto promote improvements in the quality and usefulness of education through \nfederally supported research, evaluation, and sharing of information; (5) to improve \nthe coordination of Federal education programs; (6) to improve the management \nand efficiency of Federal education activities, especially with respect to the process, \nprocedures, and administrative structures for the dispersal of Federal funds, as well \nas the reduction of unnecessary and duplicative burdens and constraints, including \nunnecessary paperwork, on the recipients of Federal funds; and (7) to increase the \naccountability of Federal education programs to the President, the Congress, and \nthe public. \n20 U.S.C. § 3402. \nUnder the Education Sciences Reform Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9501-9584 (the “Act”), Congress \nestablished an Institute of Education Sciences (the “Institute”) within the Department to: \ncompile statistics, develop products, and conduct research, evaluations, and wide \ndissemination  activities  in  areas  of  demonstrated  national  need  (including  in \ntechnology areas) that are supported by Federal funds appropriated to the Institute \nand ensure that such activities-- (A) conform to high standards of quality, integrity, \nand accuracy; and (B) are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological and are \nfree of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias.  \n20 U.S.C. § 9511(b)(2). The Act also established within the Institute four centers: the National \nCenter for Education Research, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Center \nfor Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, and the National Center for Special Education \nResearch and delineated the duties for each center. Id. §§ 9511–9567.  \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 11 of 35\n  Additionally, the Act states that the Institute shall “[d]isseminat[e] information in a timely \nfashion and in formats that are easily accessible and usable by researchers, practitioners, and the \ngeneral  public”  and  “[u]tiliz[e]  the  most  modern  technology  and  other  methods  available, \nincluding  arrangements  to  use  data  collected  electronically  by  States  and  local  educational \nagencies, to ensure the efficient collection and timely distribution of information, including data \nand reports,” and “[m]ak[e] information available to the public in an expeditious fashion.” Id. \n§ 9575(2), (3), (6).  Moreover, “data collected by the  Institute, including any office, board, \ncommittee, or center of the Institute, in carrying out the priorities and mission of the Institute, shall \nbe made available to the public, including through use of the Internet.” Id. § 9574.  \nII.  Factual Background  \nOn February 26, 2025, the President signed the “Implementing the President’s ‘Department \nof Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative” Executive Order. Exec. Order No. 14,222, \n90 Fed. Reg. 11,095 (Feb. 26, 2025) (the “Contract Executive Order”). The purpose of the order \nwas to “commence[] a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to ensure \nGovernment spending is transparent and Government employees are accountable to the American \npublic.”  Id.  § 1.  Accordingly,  this  Executive  Order  instructed  “[e]ach  Agency  Head,  in \nconsultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, [to] review all existing covered contracts and \ngrants and, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” “terminate or modify (including \nthrough renegotiation) such covered contracts and grants to reduce overall Federal spending or \nreallocate  spending  to  promote  efficiency  and  advance  the  policies  of  [the  President’s] \nAdministration.” Id. § 3(b). Covered contracts are defined as, among other things, “discretionary \nspending through Federal contracts,” but excludes “direct assistance to individuals; expenditures \nrelated  to  immigration  enforcement,  law  enforcement,  the  military,  public  safety,  and  the \nintelligence community; and other critical, acute, or emergency spending, as determined by the \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 12 of 35\nrelevant Agency Head.” Id. § 2(d). The Contract Executive Order instructed the process to \n“commence immediately” and to “prioritize the review of funds disbursed under covered contracts \nand grants to educational institutions . . . for waste, fraud, and abuse.” Id.  \nOn March 20, 2025, President Trump signed the Executive Order entitled “Improving \nEducation  Outcomes  by  Empowering  Parents,  States,  and  Communities[.]”    Exec.  Order \nNo. 14,242, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,679 (Mar. 20, 2025) (the “Department Executive Order”). The \nDepartment  Executive  Order  found  that  the  “Department  of  Education  has  entrenched  the \neducation bureaucracy” that “is not working.” Id. § 1. For example, the Order identified the \nDepartment’s “public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 \nmillion per year.” Id. Ultimately, the Order contemplates that the “[c]losure of the Department of \nEducation would drastically improve program implementation in higher education” and “would \nprovide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.” Id. \nUnder the Department Executive Order, the Secretary of Education was ordered “to the \nmaximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure \nof the Department of Education.” Exec. Order No. 14,242 § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,679. The \n“Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education \nfunds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law.” Id. § 2(b). And the Department \nExecutive Order states that it should “be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject \nto the availability of appropriations.” Id. § 3(b). Accordingly, the Secretary has stated she intends \nto  do  “an  overhaul”  of  the  Department.  U.S.  Dep’t  of  Educ.,  Secretary  McMahon:  Our \nDepartment's Final Mission (Mar. 3, 2025), https://www.ed.gov/about/news/speech/secretary-\nmcmahon-our-departments-final-mission (“Mar. 3, 2025, Speech”) (last visited Sep. 18, 2025).  \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 13 of 35\nIII.  Procedural Background \nOn April 24, 2025, Plaintiffs brought a five-count complaint alleging violations of the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (“APA”), and various constitutional claims.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) \n¶¶ 108-35.  On May 2, 2025, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction generally seeking to \nreinstate Institute employees, programs, and contracts to their pre-February 9, 2025, status.  Pls.’ \nMot. for Prelim. Inj. (ECF No. 14) at 2.  On June 3, 2025, the Court denied that motion, concluding \nPlaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  Mem. Op. (ECF No. 27) at 26-27.  \n  Thereafter, on July 21, 2025, Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint.  Am. Compl. (ECF \nNo. 31).  Plaintiffs Amended Complaint challenges the Institute’s decision to cancel contracts \nassociated with the collection and dissemination of data for certain datasets.  Id. ¶¶ 30-119.  \nAccording to Plaintiffs, those actions are causing them and their members irreparable harm.  Id. \n¶¶ 120-136.  Plaintiffs raise eleven claims.  Counts I through X allege that the cancellation of \ncontracts associated with each study was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A): \n(1)  Count I: National Assessment of Educational Process, id. ¶¶ 34-45, 137-45; \n(2)  Count II: Common Core of Data, id. ¶¶ 46-52, 146-54; \n(3)  Count III: National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, id. ¶¶ 53-63, 155-63; \n(4)  Count IV: Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, id. ¶¶ 64-69, 164-72; \n(5)  Count  V:  Early  Childhood  Longitudinal  Studies-Kindergarten,  id.  ¶¶  70-80, \n173-81; \n(6)  Count VI: High School Longitudinal Study, id. ¶¶ 81-87, 182-90; \n(7)  Count VII: Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study, id. ¶¶88-92; 191-99; \n(8)  Count VIII: Beginning Postsecondary Students, id. ¶¶ 93-99, 200-08; \n(9)  Count IX: National Household Education Survey, id. ¶¶ 100-09, 209-17; and \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 14 of 35\n(10)  Count X: Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study, id. ¶¶ 110-19; \n218-26. \nCount XI alleges the Department’s decision to “cease [the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress]-collection activities is contrary to law,” also in violation of § 706(2)(A).  Id. ¶ 229.  \nAccordingly, Plaintiffs request the Court require Defendants to resume each study.  Id. at 44-45.   \nLEGAL STANDARDS \n“One necessary condition for a case to come within this Court’s limited subject-matter \njurisdiction is that the plaintiff must have standing to pursue the case in federal court.” Travelers \nUnited, Inc. v. Hyatt Hotels Corp., 761 F. Supp. 3d 97, 109 (D.D.C. 2025) (citing Attias v. \nCarefirst, Inc., 865 F.3d 620, 624 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).  Additionally, “[t]he question of whether the \nUnited States has waived its sovereign immunity against suit[] . . . is, in the first instance, a \nquestion of subject matter jurisdiction.” McCarthy v. United States, 850 F.2d 558, 560 (9th Cir. \n1988); Yee v. Jewell, 228 F. Supp. 3d 48, 53 (D.D.C. 2017) (subject matter jurisdiction turns on \nwhether “Congress has waived the United States’ immunity to suit”).  \nA  court  must  dismiss  a  case  when  it  lacks  subject  matter  jurisdiction  pursuant  to \nRule 12(b)(1).  To determine whether there is jurisdiction, the Court may “consider the complaint \nsupplemented by undisputed facts evidenced in the record, or the complaint supplemented by \nundisputed facts plus the court’s resolution of disputed facts.”  Vico Prods. Co. v. Nat’l Lab. Rels. \nBd., 333 F.3d 198, 198 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (citations omitted); see also Jerome Stevens Pharm., Inc. \nv. FDA, 402 F.3d 1249, 1253 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (“[T]he district court may consider materials outside \nthe pleadings in deciding whether to grant a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.”).  \nIt is the plaintiff’s burden to prove subject matter jurisdiction by a preponderance of the \nevidence.  Am. Farm Bureau v. EPA, 121 F. Supp. 2d 84, 90 (D.D.C. 2000).  “Although a court \nmust accept as true all factual allegations contained in the complaint when reviewing a motion to \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 15 of 35\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1), [a] plaintiff[‘s] factual allegations in the complaint . . . will bear \ncloser scrutiny in resolving a 12(b)(1) motion than in resolving a 12(b)(6) motion for failure to \nstate a claim.”  Wright v. Foreign Serv. Grievance Bd., 503 F. Supp. 2d 163, 170 (D.D.C. 2007) \n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). A court need not accept as true “a legal conclusion \ncouched as a factual allegation” or an inference “unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint.”  \nTrudeau v. FTC, 456 F.3d 178, 193 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (internal citation and quotation marks \nomitted). \nA motion under Rule 12(b)(6) tests whether a complaint has successfully “state[d] a claim \nupon which relief can be granted.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).  While detailed factual allegations are \nnot necessary to withstand a Rule 12(b)(6) challenge, a plaintiff must nonetheless provide “more \nthan labels or conclusions” or “a formulaic” recitation of the elements of a cause of action.”  Bell \nAtl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555-56 (2007).  “To survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint \nmust contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible \non its face.’”  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570).  \nA claim is facially plausible only when a plaintiff pleads factual content that enables the \nCourt to “draw [a] reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.”  \nIqbal, 556 U.S. at 678. While the Court must assume that any “well-pleaded factual allegations” \nin a complaint are accurate, conclusory allegations “are not entitled to the assumption of truth.”  \nId. at 679.  Further, the Court “need not accept inferences drawn by the plaintiff if such inferences \nare unsupported by the facts set out in the complaint. Moreover, the court is not bound to accept \nas true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.”  Jack’s Canoes & Kayaks, LLC v. Nat’l \nPark Serv., 937 F. Supp. 2d 18, 27 (D.D.C. 2013) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  \nA complaint that “pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant’s liability, [] stops short \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 16 of 35\nof the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief,” and is insufficient to \nwithstand a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. \nat 557) (internal quotation marks omitted). \nIn considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court may consider “the facts alleged in the \ncomplaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint and matters of which \n[the Court] may take judicial notice.”  Wardrick v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, Civ. A. No. 19-0184, \n2020 WL 1821133, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 10, 2020) (quoting Hurd v. District of Columbia, 864 F.3d \n671, 678 (D.C. Cir. 2017)).  In particular, the Court may take judicial notice of information posted \non official public websites of government agencies, see, e.g., Markowicz v. Johnson, 206 F. Supp. \n3d 158, 161 n.2 (D.D.C. 2016) (citing Pharm. Rsch. & Mfrs. of Am. v. Dep’t of Health & Human \nServs., 43 F. Supp. 3d 28, 33 (D.D.C. 2014) (“Courts in this jurisdiction have frequently taken \njudicial notice of information posted on official public websites of government agencies.” (citing \nCannon v. District of Columbia, 717 F.3d 200, 205 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (taking judicial notice of \ndocument posted on D.C. public website)))), as well as court records, Veg-Mix, Inc. v. Dep’t of \nAgric., 832 F.2d 601, 607 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (holding that “[c]ourts may take judicial notice of \nofficial court records”). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The Court Should Dismiss the Amended Complaint for Lack of Subject-Matter \nJurisdiction. \nA.  Several of the Plaintiffs’ Claims Are Moot. \n“‘Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution permits federal courts to adjudicate only actual, \nongoing controversies.’”  Daimler Trucks N. Am. LLC v. EPA, 745 F.3d 1212, 1216 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (quoting United Bhd. of Carpenters & Joiners v. Operative Plasterers’ & Cement Masons’ \nInt’l Ass’n, 721 F.3d 678, 687 (D.C.Cir.2013)).  “Courts ‘may not decide questions that cannot \n- 8 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 17 of 35\naffect the rights of litigants in the case before them or give opinions advising what the law would \nbe upon a hypothetical state of facts.’”  Id. (quoting Chafin v. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013)).  \n“Moreover, the case ‘must remain live ‘at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint \nis filed.’”  Id. (quoting United Bhd. of Carpenters, 721 F.3d at 687).  A federal court should not \ndecide a case “‘if events have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the \nparties’ rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the future.’”  Id. \n(quoting LaRoque v. Holder, 679 F.3d 905, 907 (D.C. Cir. 2012)).  Here, Plaintiffs seek a court \norder to enjoining the Department “from hindering the collection, maintenance, analysis, and \ndissemination” of ten named studies.  Am. Compl. (ECF No. 31) ¶¶ 232-41.  Contracts for the \nfollowing studies, however, have been rescoped, recompeted, renegotiated, or otherwise remain in \neffect.  \n(1)  National Assessment for Education Progress (Counts I & XI). Plaintiffs allege \nthat the Department “has taken several actions to disrupt the collection, maintenance analysis, and \ndissemination of NAEP data[.]”  Am. Compl. (ECF No. 31) ¶ 42.

Plaintiffs Lack Standing.  \nStanding is a “bedrock constitutional requirement.”  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, \n675 (2023).  It requires that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” in the outcome, which “helps \nensure that courts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as Article III requires.”  FDA v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 379 (2024).  Standing doctrine thus “serves to protect the \n‘autonomy’ of those who are most directly affected so that they can decide whether and how to \nchallenge the defendant’s action.”  Id. at 379–80.  The standing doctrine further ensures that “‘the \nFramers’ concept of the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts in a democratic society’ \nis vindicated, by ensuring decisions meant for the political process are left to the political process.”  \nCoal. for Humane Immigrant Rts. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Civ. A. No. 25-0943 (TNM), 2025 \nWL 1078776, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 10, 2025) (quoting John Roberts, Article III Limits on Statutory \nStanding, 42 Duke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \n- 11 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 20 of 35\nUnder any theory of standing, “the irreducible constitutional minimum” requires that, \n(1) the plaintiff have suffered an “injury in fact” that is “concrete and particularized” and “actual \nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) there must exist “a causal connection between \nthe injury and the conduct complained of”; and (3) it must be “likely, as opposed to merely \nspeculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Friends of Animals v. \nJewell, 828 F.3d 989, 991–92 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, \n560–61 (1992)). \nPlaintiffs can demonstrate standing through informational standing.  FEC v. Akins, 524 \nU.S. 11, 25 (1998).  Membership-based associations, like Plaintiffs, can also establish standing \nthrough “organizational standing” to sue on behalf of themselves, see People for Ethical Treatment \nof Animals (“PETA”) v. Dep’t of Agric., 797 F.3d 1087, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 2015), or “associational \nstanding” to sue on behalf of their members, see Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 \nU.S. 333, 343 (1977).  Plaintiffs here fail to sufficiently allege any kind of standing.  \n1.  Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Informational Standing.  \nTo show informational standing, Plaintiffs have the burden of proving two elements: “(1) it \nhas been deprived of information that, on its interpretation, a statute requires the government or a \nthird party to disclose to it, and (2) it suffers, by being denied access to that information, the type \nof harm Congress sought to prevent by requiring disclosure.” Friends of Animals, 828 F.3d at 992 \n(cleaned up).   Nonetheless, “[a]ny informational injury still must meet the traceability and \nredressability prongs of the traditional standing analysis.”  Architects & Eng’rs for 9/11 Truth v. \nRaimondo, Civ. A. No. 21-2365 (TNM), 2022 WL 3042181, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 2022) (citing \nAkins, 524 U.S. at 25), aff’d, No. 22-5267, 2023 WL 6439491 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 3, 2023).  \nHere, Plaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege any informational standing.  Plaintiffs have not \nalleged they currently lack access to the data or information that they seek from the Institute.  As \n- 12 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 21 of 35\nto all the studies whose contracts Plaintiffs allege were terminated, Plaintiffs’ allegations are \ngrounded in mere speculation that they will not have access to the same or similar data or \ninformation in the future.  See Am. Compl. (ECF No. 31) ¶¶ 130-36.  But even if Plaintiffs could \nshow an informational injury from the cancellation of the contracts for the other studies—only one \npart of the chain they must show for standing—in many cases they cannot connect it to a statutory \nviolation rather than an exercise of proper discretion.  Any programmatic decisions regarding the \nInstitute’s handling of its statutorily required duties or responsibilities are likewise committed to \nagency discretion.  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed., 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990); Norton v. S. Utah \nWilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  Yet Plaintiffs ask this Court to insert itself into this \nprocess, and, in the name of equity, issue a programmatic injunction freezing in place the Institute’s \nprogrammatic structure.  And Plaintiffs ask this Court to do so notwithstanding the Secretary’s \ndiffering judgment about how the Institute should operate.  Having crossed—in Plaintiffs’ mind—\nsome threshold for programmatic change that is as unarticulated as it is inarticulable, Plaintiffs ask \nthis Court to step in and manage the Department’s day-to-day operations.  That is not the law.  \n2.  Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Associational Standing.  \nPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate associational standing.  To show associational standing, an \norganization must demonstrate that “(1) at least one of its members would have standing to sue in \nhis own right, (2) the interests the association seeks to protect are germane to its purpose, and (3) \nneither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires that an individual member of the \nassociation participate in the lawsuit.”  Sierra Club v. EPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \n“When a petitioner claims associational standing, it is not enough to aver that unidentified \nmembers have been injured.”  Chamber of Com. of U.S. v. EPA, 642 F.3d 192, 199 (D.C. Cir. \n2011).  “Rather, the petitioner must specifically ‘identify members who have suffered the requisite \nharm.’”  Id. (quoting Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009)); see also Am. \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 22 of 35\nChemistry Council v. Dep’t of Transp., 468 F.3d 810, 815, 820 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Ctr. for Biological \nDiversity v. Nishida, Civ. A. No. 21-119 (RDM), 2021 WL 827189, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 4, 2021) \n(finding “[t]he associational-standing doctrine demands more” where organizational plaintiff \nfailed to identify “who specifically will suffer harm–and when, how, or why they will suffer it”); \nConf. of State Bank Supervisors v. Off. of Comptroller of Currency, 313 F. Supp. 3d 285, 299 \n(D.D.C. 2018) (“[Plaintiff] fails to identify in its complaint which particular member of the \norganization has been harmed. . . . In this way, the complaint runs afoul of the baseline requirement \nto identify a particular member of the organization that was injured.”).  Indeed, “at least three \ncourts in this district have required an associational plaintiff to identify an injured member by name \nat the motion to dismiss stage.”  Conf. of State Bank Supervisors, 313 F. Supp. 3d at 298–99 \n(emphasis in original; collecting cases). \nHere, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint has failed to identify any specific members who have \nbeen allegedly harmed by Defendants’ actions. See generally Am. Compl (ECF No. 31).  This \nfailure alone subjects Plaintiffs’ claims to dismissal.  But even if the Court were to evaluate the \nstanding of the unidentified members, for the reasons stated below that doom their informational \nand organizational standing, Plaintiffs have failed to show their members have suffered any \nconcrete redressable injury.  As a result, Plaintiffs have failed to allege any associational standing. \nC.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Challenge to the Cancellation \nof the Institute’s Contracts.  \nInsofar as Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of any Institute contracts for any of the Institute \nstudies or programs, the proper course would be for the parties to those contracts to seek \nappropriate recourse under the terms of the contracts—not for Plaintiffs, as nonparties, to seek \nsuch relief through this suit.  Any challenges to the cancellation of the Institute’s contracts are not \nsubject to this Court’s jurisdiction.  Indeed, in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunctive \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 23 of 35\nrelief, this Court has already stated: “But the Court would likely lack jurisdiction to hear any \nindividual contract challenge brought by the organizations or their members if it resembled a \ntraditional contract claim.”  Mem. Op. (ECF No. 27) at 23-24.  Plaintiffs’ claims are exactly those \ntraditional contract claims that this Court is precluded from reviewing.  \nUnder the Tucker Act, any claim based on “an express or implied contract with the United \nStates” must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  The Supreme \nCourt recently reaffirmed this jurisdictional line in California:  \nThe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply “if any other statute that \ngrants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”   \n5 U.S.C. § 702. Nor does the waiver apply to claims seeking “money damages.”  \nIbid. True, a district court’s jurisdiction “is not barred by the possibility” that an \norder setting aside an agency’s action may result in the disbursement of funds.  \nBowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910, 108 S.Ct. 2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 \n(1988). But, as we have recognized, the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does \nnot extend to orders “to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money” along the \nlines of what the District Court ordered here. Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d 635 (2002). Instead, the \nTucker Act grants the Court of Federal Claims jurisdiction over suits based on “any \nexpress or implied contract with the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). \n \nDep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 967 (2025); see also U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops \nv. Dep’t of State, Civ. A. No. 25-0465 (TNM), 2025 WL 763738, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025) \n(explaining that the D.C. Circuit has long “interpreted the Tucker Act as providing the exclusive \nremedy for contract claims against the government” (cleaned up)), appeal docketed No. 25-5066 \n(D.C. Cir.).1 Since California, courts have been reacting by withholding or staying orders that \nwould have required the types of remedies sought here.  See, e.g., Am. Ass’n of Colleges for \nTeacher Ed., v. McMahon, No. 25-1281 (4th Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (granting the Government’s \nmotion to stay a preliminary injunction because of California); Mass. Fair Housing Cent. v. Dep’t \n \n1   On March 28, 2025, the D.C. Circuit denied plaintiffs’ motion for an injunction pending \nappeal and set a schedule for briefing and oral argument for September 2025. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 24 of 35\nof Hous. & Urb. Dev., Civ. A. No. 25-30041 (D. Mass Apr. 14, 2025) (dissolving temporary \nrestraining order considering the Supreme Court’s decision in California).   \nTo determine whether an action is “at its essence a contract action,” this Court looks at \nboth “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and “the type of relief \nsought (or appropriate).”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (cleaned \nup).  In this case, both of those considerations make clear that this Court lacks jurisdiction over \nany claims challenging the cancellation of the Institute’s contracts.  \nPlaintiffs cannot point to the Act and the APA as sources of the rights to the continuation \nof the contracts cancelled by the Institute.  The Act permits the Institute to perform its delineated \nfunctions “directly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.”  20 U.S.C. § 9512 \n(emphasis added).  To the extent the Act requires any of the Institute’s centers to enter contracts \nto perform their duties, Plaintiffs provide no suggestion that the Act requires the Institute to \nmaintain the particular contracts that were terminated.  Given Plaintiffs chiefly complain about the \ntermination of those specific contracts that were cancelled, the source of Plaintiffs’ challenge lies \nwithin those specific contracts themselves.  Moreover, citation to the APA is irrelevant, as the \nAPA itself will not grant jurisdiction where another statutory scheme, here the Tucker Act, applies.  \nSee Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Reserve Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 67-68 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004) (“the Tucker Act impliedly forbids” the bringing of “contract actions” against \n“the government in a federal district court” under the APA (cleaned up)).  \nIn any event, the latter Megapulse factor is dispositive here.  See Megapulse, 672 F.2d \nat 968.  The nature of relief Plaintiffs seek sounds in contract.  See Conf. of Catholic Bishops, 2025 \nWL 763738, at *7-8.  True, Plaintiffs frame their prayers for relief in the form of injunctive relief.  \nAm. Compl., Prayer for Relief.  “Though framed in terms of declaratory and injunctive relief,” a \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 25 of 35\nsuit nonetheless can be one that in substance “is for monetary damages.”  Richards v. Delta \nAirlines, Inc., 453 F.3d 525, 530 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  “No matter how [Plaintiffs] phrase it, what they \nwant is a judicial decree directing [the Institute] to pay” on the contracts.  Id. at 531.  “Yet the rule \nhas long been that a plaintiff cannot transform a claim for damages into an equitable action by \nasking for an injunction that orders the payment of money.”  Id. (citation modified).  “A court must \nlook past the label applied by the plaintiff to determine if the relief is appropriately framed in \nequity.”  Clark v. Feder Semo & Bard, P.C., 527 F. Supp. 2d 112, 117 n.1 (D.D.C. 2007) (citation \nmodified).   \nThus, Plaintiffs “seek[] the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.”  Spectrum \nLeasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  But this Court cannot order \nthe Government to continue to perform under a contract as it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction.  Id.  \nSuch a request for an order that the government “must perform” on its contract is one that “must \nbe resolved by the Claims Court.”  Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 80 (D.C. Cir. \n1985); see also California, 145 S. Ct. at 967 (the “Government is likely to succeed in showing the \nDistrict Court lacked jurisdiction to order the payment of money under the APA,” and “as we have \nrecognized, the APA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a \ncontractual obligation to pay money[.]’” (citation modified)).  Indeed, this Court has already held \nthat it has no jurisdiction to hear a claim by a federal grantee seeking specific performance on a \nfederal grant agreement.  Conf. of Catholic Bishops, 2025 WL 763738, at **6-7.  Citing the D.C. \nCircuit’s ruling in Ingersoll-Rand Co., this Court made this observation: “[t]he Court squints in \nvain to see any daylight. Like those plaintiffs, the [plaintiff] asks the Court to order the Government \nto cancel the termination, pay money due, and reinstate the contracts. . . . That is something this \nCourt lacks the power to do.”  The same is true here. \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 26 of 35\nIn  sum,  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  challenging  the  Departments’ \ncancellation of the contracts for the studies (Counts I-X).  \nII.  Plaintiffs Fail To State a Claim Under the APA.  \nPlaintiffs fail to sufficiently allege any claims under the APA.  First, Plaintiffs ask the Court \nfor a programmatic review, which is impermissible under the APA.  Second, there are adequate \nalternative remedies available as to any challenges to the termination of contracts, thus precluding \nPlaintiffs’ APA challenges.  Finally, the Department’s actions are committed to agency discretion.  \nA.  Plaintiffs Seek Impermissible Programmatic Review. \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint still does not identify a discrete and \ncircumscribed agency action that the Department has taken which could specifically be redressed \nby a federal court.  Plaintiffs must plead “an identifiable action or event” and “direct [their] attack \nagainst some particular ‘agency action’ that causes [them] harm.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891, 899; \nNorton, 542 U.S. at 62 (APA limits judicial review to “circumscribed, discrete agency actions”).  \nThese final agency actions must be “circumscribed [and] discrete.”  Norton, 542 U.S. at 62.  The \nAPA does not provide for “general judicial review of [an agency’s] day-to-day operations,” Lujan, \n497 U.S. at 899, like “constructing a building, operating a program, or performing a contract,” Vill. \nof Bald Head Island v. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 714 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 2013).  The APA thus \ncontains “a prohibition on programmatic challenges,” meaning “challenges that seek ‘wholesale \nimprovement’ of an agency’s programs by court decree.” Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Tex. v. \nUnited States, 757 F.3d 484, 490 (5th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up).  “Because ‘an on-going program or \npolicy is not, in itself, a final agency action under the APA,’ [a court’s] jurisdiction does not extend \nto reviewing generalized complaints about agency behavior.”  Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d \n301, 307 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted).  \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 27 of 35\nIndeed, the D.C. Circuit recently affirmed the application of Lujan and Norton in National \nTreasury Employees Union v. Vought, ---- F.4th ----, 2025 WL 2371608 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 15, 2025).  \nIn a challenge to the alleged dismantling of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the \n“Bureau”),  the  D.C.  Circuit  affirmed  that  the  “APA  does  not  make  federal  courts  ‘roving \ncommissions’  assigned  to  pass  on  how  well  federal  agencies  are  satisfying  their  statutory \nobligations.”  Id. at *10.  Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit found the Plaintiffs’ challenge to the \npurported  shutdown  of  the  Bureau  was  not  agency  action  as  there  had  been  no  formal \npronouncement  of  such  a  shutdown  and  as  a  result,  Plaintiffs  were  merely  challenging  “a \nconstellation  of  then-ongoing  actions—the  February  10  email,  firing  employees,  cancelling \ncontracts,  declining  additional  funding,  and  terminating  the  lease  for  the  Bureau’s  current \nheadquarters.”  Id. at **12, 13.  The Court further noted that Plaintiffs’ challenge was further \nprohibited by Norton given that it sought “an order compelling the [Bureau] to keep providing its \nmandatory services,” even though the relevant statute “gives the agency ‘a great deal of discretion \nin deciding how’ to provide them.”  Id. at *13 (emphasis in original). \nPlaintiffs’ claims (Counts I-XI) and requested relief present exactly the type of wholesale \nchallenge that the APA forbids.  Plaintiffs’ allegations reveal they do not seek judicial review of a \ndiscrete  agency  action.    Rather,  they  seek  wholesale  judicial  review  of  the  Department’s \nmanagement of the Institute’s programs.  Instead of presenting the Court with a “narrow question \nto resolve,” Cobell, 455 F.3d at 307, Plaintiffs challenge a host of individual actions—the \ncancellation of Institute contracts on several studies and programs, see, e.g., Am. Compl. (ECF \nNo. 31) ¶ 2 (alleging “the Department has taken numerous actions which curtail its ability to \ncomply with congressional mandates to collect, analyze, and disseminate ten critical datasets \nrelated to education”).  Moreover, Plaintiffs seek injunctions against the Department “from \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 28 of 35\nhindering the collection, maintenance, analysis, and dissemination” and the “resum[ption]” of each \nstudy.  See id., Prayer for Relief.  Addressing this type of claim requires the Court to supervise all \nagency activities and determine how the agency would accomplish each statutorily-mandated \nfunction—an even more extreme kind of supervisory claim than was at issue and rejected in Lujan.  \nSee 497 U.S. at 892-93.  Such a claim circumvents the purpose of the APA’s discrete agency action \nrequirement, which is to “protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful \ndiscretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack \nboth expertise and information to resolve.”  Norton, 542 U.S. at 66-67. \nIndeed, in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court noted “the \nAPA was never meant to be a bureaucratic windbreak insulating agencies from political gales.  It \ncannot  comprehensively  undo  multifaceted  agency  transformations  wrought  by  political \ndecisions.”  Mem. Op. (ECF No. 27) at 1.  This Court further observed “[i]t is not this Court’s \nplace to breathe life back into wide swathes of the Institute’s cancelled programs and then monitor \nthe agency’s day-to-day statutory compliance; essentially what Plaintiffs seek.”  Id.  As a result, \nbecause Plaintiffs continue to “bundle together broad lists of grievances and seek wholesale \nmodifications to agency operations writ large,” id. at 2, the Court must reach the same resolution \nhere and dismiss Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint for failure to identify discrete agency actions.  \nSee LaShawn A. v. Barry, 87 F.3d 1389, 1393 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (“Inconsistency is the antithesis of \nthe rule of law. For judges, the most basic principle of jurisprudence is that we must act alike in \nall cases of like nature,” thus noting that under the law-of-the-case doctrine, “the same issue \npresented a second time in the same case in the same court should lead to the same result” \n(emphasis in original; citation modified)).  \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 29 of 35\nB.  There Are Adequate Alternative Remedies Available. \nFurthermore, there are adequate alternative remedies available to foreclose Plaintiffs’ APA \nchallenges to the cancellation of the contracts for certain studies.  \nReview under the APA is available only where “there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  The requirement that a plaintiff have “no other adequate remedy in court,” \nid., reflects that “Congress did not intend the general grant of review in the APA to duplicate \nexisting procedures for review of agency action,” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 903.  As the D.C. Circuit has \nobserved, “the alternative remedy need not provide relief identical to relief under the APA, so long \nas it offers relief of the ‘same genre.’”  Garcia v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 519, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n(citation omitted). If there exists an alternative adequate judicial remedy, a plaintiff lacks a cause \nof action under the APA.  See Perry Cap. LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 621 (D.C. Cir. 2017); \nsee also Versata Dev. Corp. v. Rea, 959 F. Supp. 2d 912, 927 (E.D. Va. 2013) (dismissing putative \nAPA claim under Rule 12(b)(6) because decision at issue was not a final agency action and an \nalternative adequate remedy existed by way of appeal to the Federal Circuit).  As explained above, \nall of Plaintiffs’ challenges to the termination of the contracts for certain studies are at essence \ncontract claims, and therefore, the Court of Federal Claims provides an adequate alternative venue \nunder the Tucker Act. \nTo the extent Plaintiffs seek the restoration of each canceled contract, such remedy also is \nprecluded as impermissible money damages claim.  The APA does not waive sovereign immunity \nto a suit for “money damages.”  5 U.S.C. § 702; accord Jibril v. Mayorkas, 101 F.4th 857, 870 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2024)  (“the APA  does  not  authorize  suits  seeking  ‘money  damages’  against  the \nGovernment”).  “Almost invariably . . . suits seeking (whether by judgment, injunction, or \ndeclaration) to compel the defendant to pay a sum of money to [a party] are suits for ‘money \ndamages,’ as that phrase has traditionally been applied.”  Knudson, 534 U.S. at 210 (quoting \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 30 of 35\nBowen, 487 U.S. at 918-19 (Scalia, J., dissenting)); accord Richards v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., 453 \nF.3d 525, 531 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (same).  Accordingly, the APA’s limited waiver of sovereign \nimmunity does not extend to this suit.  See 5 U.S.C. § 702; Jibril, 101 F.4th at 870. \nC.  The Department’s Programmatic Implementation Decisions Are Committed \nto Agency Discretion. \n“Judicial review under [the arbitrary and capricious] standard is deferential, and a court \nmay not substitute its own policy judgment for that of the agency.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio \nProject, 592 U.S. 414, 423 (2021).  Rather, the Court must ensure “that the agency has acted within \na zone of reasonableness[.]”  Id.  “[T]he standard of review is highly deferential” in determining \nwhether an action is arbitrary and capricious, Littlefield v. Dep’t of Interior, 85 F.4th 635, 643 (1st \nCir. 2023), and agency action regarding reallocation of resources and reorganizing of enforcement \npriorities after a change in presidential administrations, if reviewable at all, must be afforded \nhighly deferential rational basis review, cf. Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993) (noting that, \nabsent a statutory directive to the contrary, an agency has unreviewable “capacity to adapt to \nchanging circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees as the most effective \nor desirable way.”).  Plaintiffs bear the burden of alleging that these actions are arbitrary and \ncapricious. City of Olmsted Falls v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 292 F.3d 261, 271 (D.C. Cir. 2002) \n(quotations omitted). Plaintiffs here come nowhere close to meeting their pleading burden.  The \nDepartment is required under the executive orders to perform its statutory obligations.  Ultimately, \nCourts lack the power to “dictat[e] to the agency the methods[] [and] procedures” it uses to \ncomplete its statutory obligations.  See Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 435 U.S. 519, 545 (1978) (quoting Fed. Power Comm’n v. Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., \n423 U.S. 326, 333 (1976)).  To override these principles and enjoin agency leadership from \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 31 of 35\nexercising control over the implementation of any statutorily mandated programs would be an \nextraordinary violation of the separation of powers. \n“In determining whether a matter has been committed solely to agency discretion, [courts] \nconsider both the nature of the administrative action at issue and the language and structure of the \nstatute that supplies the applicable legal standards for reviewing that action.”  Drake v. FAA, 291 \nF.3d 59, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Here, each factor shows that Defendants’ managerial decisions are \ncommitted to agency discretion. \nFirst, decisions on how to implement a program fit neatly among those “categories of \nadministrative  decisions  that  courts  traditionally  have  regarded  as  ‘committed  to  agency \ndiscretion.’”    Lincoln,  508  U.S.  at 191-92  (citation  omitted).    After  all,  the  point  of  the \nDepartment’s actions is to improve efficiency, which allows the Department to “meet its statutory \nresponsibilities in what [the new administration] sees as the most effective or desirable way.” \nLincoln, 508 U.S. at 192.  Similarly, “an agency’s decision not to prosecute or enforce, whether \nthrough civil or criminal process, is a decision generally committed to an agency’s absolute \ndiscretion.”    Heckler  v.  Chaney,  470  U.S.  821,  831  (1985).    The  decisions  on  program \nimplementation reflect the Administration’s effort to realign the Department to provide better \nservice to the American people.  “The agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with \nthe many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.” Id. at 831-32.  \nSecond, Plaintiffs cannot point to a particular statute limiting the Department’s inherent \ndiscretion to maintain the same contracts as before.  Again, agencies generally have broad \ndiscretion to determine how to implement a statute. See Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 543. \nBut even if this Court were to conclude that the Department’s explanations for cancelling \ncontracts is insufficient to withstand judicial review, that would in no way justify the injunctive \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 32 of 35\nrelief that Plaintiffs seek.  See Am. Compl. (ECF No. 31) Prayer for Relief (seeking relief to enjoin \nDefendants  to  resume  studies).    Rather,  “the  proper  course”  would  be  “to  remand  to  the \n[Department] for additional . . . explanation,” not issue any type of injunction.  Fla. Power & Light \nCo. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985).  \nIII.  Defendants Should Be Relieved of Their Obligation to File a Certified List of the \nAdministrative Record and Serve the Administrative Record Simultaneously with \nthis Motion.  \nDefendants should be excused from Local Civil Rule 7(n)(1)’s requirement that Defendants \nfile a certified list of an administrative record and serve an administrative record simultaneously \nwith this dispositive motion.  Pursuant to Local Rule 7(m), counsel for Defendants conferred with \ncounsel for Plaintiffs about this requested relief.  Plaintiffs oppose. \nAn administrative record is not necessary to resolve this motion, which argues that judicial \nreview is not available in this case—a threshold legal issue that does not require review of the \nadministrative record. Moreover, even if judicial review were available, Defendants have moved \nto dismiss by relying entirely on the facts alleged in the Amended Complaint or facts upon which \nthe Court make take judicial notice. \nIndeed, courts in this district routinely grant the government’s requests to defer the filing \nof a certified list of the contents of the administrative record when it is unnecessary in deciding a \ndispositive motion.  See, e.g., Connecticut v. Dep’t of Interior, 344 F. Supp. 3d 279, 294 (D.D.C. \n2018) (Court granted Federal Defendants’ motion to waive compliance with Local Civil Rule 7(n) \nbecause the Court did not need to consider the administrative record in evaluating the motions \nbefore it); Mdewakanton Sioux Indians of Minn. v. Zinke, 264 F. Supp. 3d 116, 123 n.12 (D.D.C. \n2017) (same); Carroll v. Office of Fed. Contract Compliance Programs, 235 F. Supp. 3d 79, 81 \nn.1 (D.D.C. 2017); PETA v. Fish & Wildlife Serv., 59 F. Supp. 3d 91, 94 n.2 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(waiving compliance with Local Civil Rule 7(n) and dismissing complaint).  \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 33 of 35\nFurther, this Court should determine whether it has jurisdiction over this case before \nrequiring Defendants to compile and certify the administrative record.  The Court must determine \nthat it has jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env’t, \n523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (“Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.”) \n(citation omitted); see also Talal Al-Zahrani v. Rodriguez, 669 F.3d 315, 318 (D.C. Cir. 2012) \n(“Because a federal court without jurisdiction cannot perform a law-declaring function in a \ncontroversy, ‘the Supreme Court [has] held “that Article III jurisdiction is always an antecedent \nquestion” to be answered prior to any merits inquiry.’” (quoting Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dist. Court \nfor the Dist. of Columbia, 486 F.3d 1342, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2007))); Ass’n of Battery Recyclers, Inc. \nv.  EPA,  716  F.3d  667,  674  (D.C.  Cir.  2013)  (“this  Circuit  treats  prudential  standing  as  a \njurisdictional issue which cannot be waived or conceded” (citations and quotations omitted)). \nThus, the Court must first determine whether it has jurisdiction given that Defendants have \ndemonstrated in the first instance that no judicial review is available here.  \nAs a result, excusing Defendants from Local Civil Rule 7(n)’s requirements at this juncture \nwould promote judicial economy and conserve resources.  \n \n*   *  * \n \n   \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 32     Filed 09/18/25     Page 34 of 35\nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, Plaintiffs’ Second Amended Complaint should be dismissed. Defendants \nshould also be relieved of their obligation to file a certified list of the administrative record and \nserve the administrative record simultaneously with their Motion to Dismiss. \nDated: September 18, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nJEANINE FERRIS PIRRO \nUnited States Attorney \n \nBRIAN P.

Royal, NJ 08061 \nPlaintiffs, \nvs. \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, \n400 Maryland Avenue, SW \nWashington, D.C. 20202 \nand \nLINDA MCMAHON, in her official capacity \nas Secretary of Education, \n400 Maryland Avenue, SW \nWashington, D.C. 20202 \nDefendants. \nPLAINTIFFS’ MEMORANDUM OF LAW IN SUPPORT OF \nTHEIR MOTION FOR A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION \nThrough the Education Sciences Reform Act (“ESRA”), Congress requires the Defendants \nU.S. Department of Education (the “Department”) and Secretary of Education (collectively, \n“Defendants”) to collect, maintain, analyze, and disseminate high-quality educational data through \nthe Institute of Education Sciences (“IES”), and its research centers, including the National Center \nfor Education Statistics (“NCES”). As recently as 2024, Congress appropriated hundreds of \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 2 of 34\n     \n \nmillions of dollars to the Department to meet its critical legal obligations to collect and disseminate \nfederal educational data.  \nPlaintiffs the National Academy of Education (“NAEd”) and the National Council of \nMeasurement in Education (“NCME”) are educational nonprofit organizations whose members \nare researchers and experts who rely on IES data for their research on pressing educational issues. \nIES  data  is  critical  to  Plaintiffs’  and  their  members’  research  on  ensuring  equal  access  to \neducational resources, opportunities, and support for all students. Among other things, Plaintiffs \nand their members use this data to measure national trends in education outcomes and changes in \nthe distribution of financial aid. Restrictions on the availability and quality of this data severely \nhinder Plaintiffs’ and their members’ work and the development of practices, programs, and \npolicies stemming from this work to improve opportunities and outcomes for all students. \nDespite these harms to Plaintiffs and their members, and in violation of federal mandates, \nDefendants have severely restricted the Department’s ability to collect and disseminate federal \neducational data. For example, Defendants have cancelled over $900 million in contracts necessary \nfor the maintenance and operation of data collected by IES. Defendants have also halved the \nDepartment’s overall workforce and imposed even starker layoffs at IES and NCES, shrinking \nIES’s workforce from over 175 to 20 employees, and NCES’s workforce from approximately 100 \nemployees down to three. This significant reduction in staff renders it impossible for IES to comply \nwith its congressional mandates to collect, analyze, and disseminate critical and high-quality \neducational datasets. Moreover, where federal education data already exists, Defendants have \nterminated Plaintiffs’ and their members’ access to this data in contravention of federal law, which \nrequires Defendants to make IES data publicly available. See, e.g., Bastedo Decl. ¶¶ 10–14, Ex. 1.   \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 3 of 34\n     \n \nDefendants’ restrictions on the collection, maintenance, and analysis of IES data violate \nthe Administrative  Procedure Act (“APA”). Defendants’ actions have been  conducted in an \narbitrary and capricious manner, which exceeds Defendants’ statutory authority and blatantly \ndefies federal laws like ESRA. Defendants’ actions also unlawfully violate the constitutional \nSeparation of Powers, which provides that only Congress can dismantle or significantly limit the \nfunction of federal agencies.  \nDefendants’ failure to provide access to and maintain this statutorily-mandated federal \neducation data irreparably harms Plaintiffs and their members. These harms cannot be remedied at \nsome future time at the close of this litigation. Plaintiffs may never be able to recover IES data lost \nas a result of Defendants’ contract terminations and reductions in the workforce. Without this data, \nPlaintiffs’ and their members’ work will be severely hindered and may need to be abandoned \ncompletely.  \nThe impacts of these harms will be most deeply felt by students of color; students with \ndisabilities; English language learners and multilingual learners; and low-income students who \nbenefit from and rely on Plaintiffs’ and their members’ education work. Preliminary relief is \ntherefore necessary and appropriate to curtail the harms Defendants have already caused and \ncontinue to cause to Plaintiffs, their members, and America’s entire educational system. Plaintiffs \nrespectfully request a preliminary injunction to prohibit Defendants from taking any further action \nto limit access to this crucial data and to immediately restore access to data that has already been \nrestricted.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND  \n \nA. The  Creation  and  Development  of  Federal  Education  Research  Institutes  and \nCenters.  \n \nSince the 1860s, the federal government has dedicated significant resources towards the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 4 of 34\ncollection, analysis, and dissemination of high-quality educational data for the benefit of our \nnation’s students. Thomas D. Snyder, 120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait, \nNat’l Ctr. for Educ. Stat. (1993), https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf, Ex. 2. To that end, it has \nworked to improve and expand educational statistical research and provide additional resources \nfor the evaluation of our educational system. Id. In 2002, President George W. Bush signed H.R. \n3801, which included ESRA, a landmark act “to provide for improvement of Federal education \nresearch, statistics, evaluation, information and dissemination.” See Pub.  L. 107-279; 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 9501–84. Through ESRA, Congress recommitted to prioritizing the federal government’s role \nin educational data collection, evaluation, and dissemination, and reconstituted the Department’s \nprior research office as IES.  \nIES is the statistics, research, and evaluation arm of the Department. IES was created “to \nprovide scientific evidence on which to ground education practice and policy and to share this \ninformation  in  formats  that  are  useful  and  accessible  to  educators,  parents,  policymakers, \nresearchers, and the public.” About IES, Inst. of Educ. Sci., https://ies.ed.gov/about (last visited \nApr. 21, 2025), Ex. 3. \nIES has a congressional mandate to: \ndirectly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements . . . (1) conduct \nand support scientifically valid research activities, including basic research and \napplied research, statistics activities, scientifically valid education evaluation, \ndevelopment, and wide dissemination; (2) widely disseminate the findings and \nresults  of  scientifically  valid  research  in  education;  (3)  promote  the  use, \ndevelopment,  and  application  of  knowledge  gained  from  scientifically  valid \nresearch activities; (4) strengthen the national capacity to conduct, develop, and \nwidely disseminate scientifically valid research in education; (5) promote the \ncoordination, development, and dissemination of scientifically valid research in \neducation within the Department and the Federal Government; and (6) promote \nthe use and application of research and development to improve practice in the \nclassroom.  § 9512.  \nThrough IES, Congress sought to improve both the quantity and quality of educational data \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 5 of 34\n     \n \ncollection by increasing not only the amount of data collected but also by setting high standards \nand processes for the review of the research that relies on this data. National Center for Education \nStatistics (NCES), Nat’l Ctr. for Educ. Stat., https://nces.ed.gov/ (last visited Apr. 21, 2025), Ex. 4. \nAlong with this improvement in the quantity and quality of educational data, Congress \ncharged IES with ensuring that the research findings uncovered through IES data would be widely \ndistributed to researchers, schools, educators, parents, students, and other public stakeholders. Id. \nAn example of this required dissemination is the congressionally mandated statistical report on the \nconditions and progress of education in the United States that the Department is required to \nproduce annually. See 20 U.S.C. § 9545.   \nIn carrying out these mandates, Congress requires IES to establish and operate four \nresearch centers (collectively, “IES’s Centers”), id. § 9511(c), —National Center for Education \nStatistics (NCES), id §§ 9541–48, the National Center for Education Evaluation (NCEE), id §§ \n9561–64, the National Center for Education Research (NCER), id §§ 9531-34, and the National \nCenter for Special Education Research (NCSER), id §§ 9567–67b —to maintain specialized \nfederal education data and information. Each of these research centers are statutorily required to \ncollect, analyze, and disseminate federal education data. See id. \nIES datasets include, among many others, those that are collected, analyzed, and reported \nthrough: \n•  the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which measures student \nachievement in multiple subject areas, see id. § 9622; \n \n•  EDFacts,  which  is  a  centralized  hub  for  high-quality  data from  pre-kindergarten \nthrough grade 12 provided by school districts and state education agencies; The \nEDFacts Initiative, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., https://www.ed.gov/data/edfacts-initiative \n(last visited May 2, 2025), Ex. 5 \n \n•  the  National  Postsecondary  Student  Aid  Study  (NPSAS),  which  examines \ncharacteristics of students in postsecondary education, with a special focus on how they \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 6 of 34\n     \n \nfinance their education and was designed to fulfill the requirements of 20 U.S.C. § \n1015; \n \n•  Education Longitudinal Studies (ELS), which enable the study of the educational \nexperiences, outcomes, and transitions of students throughout their lives, including \ntheir  transitions  into  postsecondary  education  and  the  workforce;  Longitudinal \nSurveys:  Longitudinal  Surveys  Branch,  Nat’l  Ctr.  for  Educ.  Stat., \nhttps://nces.ed.gov/surveys/lsb/ (last visited Apr. 29, 2025) [“Longitudinal Surveys \nBranch, NCES”], Ex. 6; and \n \n•  the What Works Clearinghouse (WWC), which is a resource hub for scientific evidence \non education programs, products, practices and policies. What Works Clearinghouse, \nWhat We Do, Inst. of Educ. Sci., https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/WhatWeDo (last visited \nApr. 29, 2025), Ex. 7. \n \nESRA provides that the above-mentioned datasets from IES’s Centers and any other “data \ncollected by [IES], including any office, board, committee, or center of [IES], in carrying out the \npriorities and mission of [IES], shall be made available to the public, including through use of the \nInternet.” Id. § 9574. \nB.  The  Department’s  Termination  of  Contracts,  Reduction  in  Force,  and  Limited \nAvailability  of  Data.  \n \nOn March 20, 2025, President Trump issued an Executive Order directing the Secretary of \nEducation to dismantle the Department. Exec. Order 14242, 90 Fed. Reg. 13,679 (Mar. 20, 2025), \nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/improving-education-outcomes-by-\nempowering-parents-states-and-communities/, Ex. 8. According to this Order, the Secretary shall, \nto the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, “take all necessary steps to facilitate the \nclosure of the Department of Education.” Id. The Order further states that the Department should \nbe closed, and its main functions “returned to the states,” purportedly because the “federal \neducation bureaucracy is not working.” Id. \nIn carrying out this goal of dismantling the Department, the Administration fired agency \nstaff in mass and canceled hundreds of millions of dollars in Department contracts.   \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 7 of 34\n     \n \ni.  The Department’s Contract Cancellations at IES and its Centers.  \nIES and its Centers rely on contracts with independent contractors and cannot fulfill their \nstatutory mandates without such contracts. NCES, for example, typically employed one employee \nfor every ten contractors. See Jeffrey Mervis, Cancelling Data Collections Could Imperil Efforts \nto  Improve  U.S.  Education,  Science  (Feb.  12,  2025), \nhttps://www.science.org/content/article/canceling-data-collections-could-imperil-efforts-\nimprove-u-s-education-former-trump, Ex. 9; see also Ho Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 10. Contractors are \ninvolved in all aspects of NCES’s work. See Ex. 9. As such, these contract cancellations have \nimpacted IES’s Centers’ ability to collect future data, store and maintain it, and analyze it.

The Department’s Reduction in Force.  \nOn March 11, 2025, the Department announced a Reduction in Force (RIF) of nearly 50% \nof its workforce. Press Release, U.S. Dep’t of Educ., U.S. Department of Education Initiates \nReduction in Force (Mar. 11, 2025), https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-\nof-education-initiates-reduction-force, Ex. 20. These cuts have been particularly significant at IES, \nreducing its workforce from over 175 employees down to twenty, and with NCES drastically \nshrinking from approximately 100 employees down to three. Jill Barshay, Chaos and Confusion \nas the Statistics Arm of the Education Department is Reduced to a Skeletal Staff of 3, Hechinger \nRep.

The reduction in force will compound the harm caused by the loss of independent \ncontractors, therefore making it virtually impossible for IES’s Centers to perform their data \ncollection work as legally required. Additionally, many of the impacted datasets  are not readily \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 10 of 34\n     \n \navailable from any other source.

The Department Disrupted Access to Data  \nFurthermore, the Department has significantly limited researchers’ access to and use of \nrestricted-use data, which is data that requires special permission from the Department in order to \naccess, and other public-use data. For example, in March 2025, the Department issued a stop work \norder on Professor Derek Briggs’ research that relied on restricted-use NAEP data. Briggs Decl. ¶ \n10, 13, Ex. 12. In February 2025, Professor Michael Bastedo applied for a restricted-use data \nlicense for the High School Longitudinal Study (HSLS) data. Bastedo Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 1. In April \n2025, the Department notified Professor Bastedo that it had paused all applications for restricted-\nuse data, and that there was no timeframe for when the application would be reviewed. Id. ¶ 14. \nAs a result, Professor Bastedo has no way of legally accessing this data or continuing this work. \nId. ¶¶ 15-16.   \nARGUMENT \nTo prevail on a request for a preliminary injunction, Plaintiffs with standing must show \nthat: (1) they are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in \nthe absence of preliminary relief, (3) the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor, and (4) the \nrequested relief is in the public interest. Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). Because all \nfactors weigh in Plaintiffs’ favor, this court should grant a preliminary injunction.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 11 of 34\n     \n \nI.  Plaintiffs have Standing.   \n \nArticle III standing requires that a plaintiff demonstrate (1) an “injury in fact,” (2) fairly \ntraceable to the defendant’s challenged action, (3) that is “likely” to be “redressed by a favorable \ndecision.” Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992).  \nPlaintiffs NAEd and NCME can demonstrate both associational standing—“a cognizable \ninjury to one or more of its members,’” Kingman v. Park Civic Ass’n v. Bowser, 815 F.3d 36, 39 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016)—and organizational standing, showing injury to their organizations.  \nA. Associational Standing. \nTo establish associational standing, Plaintiffs must show that “(1) [their] members would \notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (2) the interests [they] seek[] to protect are \ngermane to the organization[s’] purpose; and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.” Ctr. for Sustainable Econ. v. \nJewell, 779 F.3d 588, 596 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quotation marks omitted). \n1.  Plaintiffs’ Members Have Standing to Sue in Their Own Right.  \nPlaintiffs’ members have standing to sue because they have suffered informational injuries \nbased on Defendants’ curtailment of IES data collection, analysis, and dissemination. To plead an \ninformational-injury  claim,  a  plaintiff  must  establish  that  (1)  Congress  created  a  legally \nenforceable right to receive information; and (2) the plaintiff suffered concrete harm due to the \nfailure to receive this information. See Spokeo v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 348 (2016); Federal \nElection Comm’n v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 12 (1998); Rise for Animals v. Vilsack, No. 8:22-CV-\n00810-JRR, 2024 WL 1243847, at *8 (D. Md. Mar. 21, 2024).  \nRegarding the first factor, IES’s Centers have a clear Congressional mandate to conduct \n“scientifically valid” research, “widely disseminate the findings and results” of this research, and \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 12 of 34\n     \n \n“promote the coordination, development, and dissemination of scientifically valid research in \neducation within the Department” and across the federal government. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 9512, \n9541–48. (establishing NCES’s obligation to disseminate federal education data); id. § 9562 \n(establishing same for NCEE); id. § 9533 (establishing same for NCER); id. § 9567b (establishing \nsame for NCSER). \nAs such, Congress has clearly mandated that IES collect and publish federal educational \ndata, and Congress has established a corresponding right for the public to receive this data. Similar \nfederal laws requiring the collection and dissemination of data have been interpreted to create a \ncorresponding right to information. See, e.g., Spokeo, 578 U.S. at 335, 342 (holding that the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act (FCRA) created a statutory right to information by requiring consumer \nreporting agencies to revise credit reports to assure their “maximum possible accuracy” and to \nnotify consumers of their responsibilities under FCRA); Akins, 524 U.S. at 14-15, 20-28 (finding \nthat the Federal Election Campaign Act created a statutory right to information by “impos[ing] \nextensive recordkeeping and disclosure requirements”); Campaign Legal Ctr. v. Fed. Election \nComm’n, 31 F.4th 781, 790 (D.C. Cir. 2022); Friends of Animals v. Jewell, 824 F.3d 1033, 1041 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (“Under the language of Section 10(c), the Secretary of the Interior must disclose \ninformation it receives in connection with any Section 10 permit. . . .Thus, Section 10(c) clearly \ncreates a right to information upon which a claim of informational standing may be predicated.”). \nRegarding the second factor, the inability to receive this information poses concrete harms \nto Plaintiffs’ members. Many of Plaintiffs’ members rely on Defendants’ datasets to complete their \nresearch, scholarship, and instruction.  \nFor  example,  Plaintiffs’  members  rely  on  EDFacts  and  the  National Assessment  of \nEducational Progress (NAEP) for their work on the Educational Opportunity Project, which is a \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 13 of 34\n     \n \nclearinghouse for data on educational achievement across the country. Reardon Decl. ¶ 12-14, Ex. \n14; Ho Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 10. EDFacts and NAEP enable Professors Sean Reardon and Andrew Ho \nto compare school and district scores to each other by stitching various datasets together for a \ncomprehensive perspective on academic opportunity. Reardon Decl. ¶¶ 16-17, Ex. 14; Ho Decl. ¶ \n12, Ex. 10. They learned through public reporting in February and March 2025 that contracts \nnecessary for the collection of these datasets had been cut. Reardon Decl. ¶ 27, Ex. 14; Ho Decl. \n¶ 16, Ex. 10. As a result, they will be unable to continue their work on the Educational Opportunity \nProject due to the Department’s failure to continue to collect, maintain and analyze EdFacts and \nNAEP data. Ho Decl ¶ 19, Ex. 10.  \nProfessor Reardon also relies on the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten \n(ECLS-K) in his research on patterns of kindergarten readiness and the effectiveness of early \nchildhood education programs and elementary schools. Reardon Decl. ¶¶ 22-23, Ex. 14. Collecting \ndata for the ECLS-K is resource intensive, involving 1-on-1 assessments from a trained specialist \nof a random sample of 15,000-25,000 Kindergarten students at multiple points throughout their \nearly childhood education. Id. Reardon learned through public reporting in March 2025 that \ncontracts  associated  with  the  collection,  analysis,  and  dissemination  of  ELCS-K  data  were \ncancelled. Id. ¶ 25. Without access to the new ECLS-K data, Reardon cannot complete research \nexamining school readiness and the factors that lead to improvements in readiness. Id. ¶ 30. \nProfessor Susan Dynarski’s research relies on the National Postsecondary Student Aid \nStudy (NPSAS) to study the distribution of federal financial aid. Dynarski Decl. ¶¶ 6, 10, Ex. 15. \nDynarski plans to study the impact of the recent FAFSA Simplification Act on the number and \ndemographics of students applying for and receiving financial aid, which requires student-level \ndata only collected through NPSAS surveys. Id. ¶ 12. Around February 11, 2025, Dynarski was \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 14 of 34\n     \n \ninformed by education researchers and news reports that contracts necessary for the collection of \nNPSAS data were cancelled. Id. ¶ 13. Without those contracts, existing NPSAS surveys will not \nbe updated, and new NPSAS surveys will not be launched. Id. Consequently, Dynarski’s research \non the impact of the FAFSA Simplification Act will be impossible. Id. \nProfessor Teresa McCarty relies on the National Indian Education Survey (NIES) survey \nfor her research on improving education practice and policy for Native American students. \nMcCarty Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8, 16, 17, Ex. 16. On April 22, 2025, Professor McCarty was made aware \nthrough news sources that access to the NIES would be curtailed or eliminated. Id. ¶ 13. There are \nno comparable datasets to the NIES, id. ¶ 9, so without access to it, her research will be \nsignificantly negatively impacted, undermining the ability to ameliorate longstanding academic \ndisparities experienced by underserved Native American students. Id. ¶ 18. \nPlaintiffs’ members also rely on IES data in their instruction and coursework as education \nprofessors. For example, Professor Elizabeth Tipton and her students rely on the What Works \nClearinghouse (WWC) to identify problems and develop new methods to improve the quality of \neducation research. Tipton Decl. ¶ 18, Ex. 31. As of February 10, 2025, at least six contracts \nsupporting the operation and availability of WWC were canceled, threatening Tipton’s ability to \ncontinue this instruction. Id. ¶ 19. Professor Worell relies on NCES datasets and reports to teach \nhis course on “Psychosocial Development.” Worell Decl. ¶¶ 9-10, Ex. 24 On February 11, Worrell \nlearned through public reporting that contracts necessary to collect and maintain these data sets \nhad been canceled. Id. ¶ 12. Without continued collection and maintenance of this data, his research \nand the research of his students will be substantially hindered. Id. ¶ 14. \nIn sum, there are no other comparable datasets that collect and measure the same metrics \nas those made available through the Department. See Ho Decl. ¶¶ 14-15, Ex. 10; Johnson Decl. ¶ \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 15 of 34\n     \n \n12, Ex. 11; Bastedo Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 1; Reardon Decl. ¶ 15, Ex. 14; Worell Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 24; \nMcCarty Decl. ¶ 9, 17, Ex. 16; Dynarski Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 15; Barnett Decl. ¶¶ 7, 10, 14, Ex. 23.

See, e.g., Pub. Citizen v. U.S. Dep’t of Just., 491 \nU.S. 440, 449 (1989); Jewell, 824 F.3d at 1041 (finding that an animal-rights group would be \nharmed by the failure to obtain information under the Endangered Species Act because the group \nwould have used the information to “meaningfully participate in the Act's permitting process, as \nwell as engage in related advocacy efforts to protect the three antelope species.”); Doctors for \nAmerica v. OPM, CV 25-322 (JDB), 2025 WL 452707 at *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025 (finding that \nplaintiff organization had associational standing based on allegations from several doctor-members \nthat the “denial of information these doctors wish to use in their routine activities has inhibited \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 16 of 34\n     \n \ntheir daily operations and thereby caused an injury both concrete and specific to the work in which \nthey are engaged”). \nThis concrete injury is directly traceable to Defendants’ actions in gutting IES. Defendants’ \ninstitution of the RIF, their cancellation of vital contracts, and their restrictions on data licenses are \ncreating Plaintiffs’ members’ informational injuries. As set forth above, Defendants’ refusal to \nreview restricted-use data licenses, see supra pp. 10, has limited Plaintiffs’ members’ access to \ndata,  and  Defendants’  cancellation  of  contracts,  see  supra  pp.  8–10,  13–14  has  halted  the \ncollection, maintenance, and analysis of IES data. \nEven where data collection lapses or data is lost or destroyed by a third-party contractor, \nthere is a clear causal link between any such lost data and the Defendants’ actions. See Whitman-\nWalker Clinic, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 485 F. Supp. 3d 1, 24 (D.D.C. 2020) \n(noting that this Circuit has “routinely found causation established in cases where the relevant \n‘third-party conduct is voluntary but reasonably predictable.’”). Plaintiffs’ members’ injuries are \nthus traceable to Defendants. Id. at 29. \nPlaintiffs’  members’  injuries  are  clearly  redressable  by  the  relief  sought.  Plaintiffs’ \nmembers will be able to carry out their research and teaching if: (1) Defendants are required to \npromptly  reinstate  or  otherwise  provide  for  new  contracts  necessary  to  fulfill  IES’s \ncongressionally-mandated  data-collection  obligations;  (2)  Defendants  are  enjoined  from \ncancelling any additional necessary contracts or otherwise destroying IES data; and (3) Defendants \nrestore IES employee positions at least to an amount sufficient to ensure compliance with \ncongressional mandates. \n2.  This Suit Is Germane to Plaintiffs’ Organizational Purposes. \nThe members’ interests this suit aims to protect are plainly germane to the missions of both \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 17 of 34\n     \n \nPlaintiffs NAEd and NCME.  \nNAEd’s mission is to advance high-quality research to improve education policy and \npractice. Lee Decl. ¶ 5,Ex. 30. To carry out this mission, NAEd undertakes research studies to \naddress pressing educational issues. Id. ¶ 9. Protecting members’ interests in access to federal \neducation data, critical to member’s research, is clearly germane to NAEd’s mission to advance \nhigh-quality research to improve education policy and practice. Id. ¶ 12.  \nProtecting this access to federal education data is equally critical to NCME’s mission of \nadvancing the science and scholarship of educational measurement. Patz Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 13. In \nparticular, the interests this suit aims to protect are paramount to NCME’s goals of promoting \nknowledge, understanding, and implementation of best practices in educational measurement. Id. \n3.  Neither the Claims Asserted nor the Relief Requested Requires the Participation of \nIndividual Members in the Lawsuit. \n \n“This third element ‘focus[es] on matters of administrative convenience and efficiency, not \non elements of a case or controversy.’” United Food & Com.

Organizational Standing \nPlaintiffs  NAEd  and  NCME  have  organizational  standing  because  Defendants  have \ndeprived them of information they are legally entitled to in a manner that directly affects and \ninterferes with their core activities. See Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights v. DHS, No. 1:25-\ncv-00943 (TNM), 2025 WL 1078776, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 10, 2025) (quoting FDA v. All. for \nHippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367 (2024)); see also Akins, 524 U.S. at 21. “The law is settled that ‘a \ndenial of access to information’ qualifies as an injury in fact ‘where a statute (on the claimants’ \nreading) requires that the information ‘be publicly disclosed’ and there ‘is no reason to doubt their \nclaim that the information would help them.’” Env’t Def. Fund v. EPA, 922 F.3d 446, 452 (D.C. \nCir. 2019) (quoting Jewell, 824 F.3d at 1040–41; see also TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. \n413, 441–42 (2021) (plaintiff suffered a concrete injury when denied legally-required information \nand that denial had “downstream consequences”). Plaintiffs also suffer an injury where, as here, a \nfederal agency delays their access to data. See, e.g., Council of Parent Attorneys & Advocates, Inc. \nv. DeVos, 365 F. Supp. 3d 28, 39–45 (D.D.C 2019); Am. Hist. Ass’n v. NARA, 516 F. Supp. 2d 90, \n106 (D.D.C. 2007) (recognizing that “denial of ‘timely access’” to documents is a cognizable \ninformational injury).  \nAs explained above, IES is required to provide Plaintiffs NAEd and NCME with a variety \nof data under ESRA. See 20 U.S.C. §§ 9512, 9574-75; supra. These provisions require IES “to \nprovide robust public information,” and “create a right to information sufficient for [Plaintiffs’] \ninjury.” Ctr. for Bio. Diversity v. U.S. Int’l Dev. Fin. Corp., 77 F.4th 679, 686 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  \nPlaintiffs utilize this statutorily-required data to carry out their core activities. NAEd’s \nresearch arm regularly identifies, develops, and publishes various research projects. For example, \na recent NAEd project titled “Evaluating and Improving Teacher Preparation Programs” highlights \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 19 of 34\n     \n \nthe  critical  context  surrounding  teacher  education  and  provides  research-informed \nrecommendations for evaluating and improving both teacher-preparation programs and the larger \neducational and policy contexts in which these programs are situated. Lee Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 30. Like \nother  NAEd  research  projects,  this  project  relied  on  IES  data  to  support  its  findings  and \nrecommendations.  \nNCME regularly publishes three journals:  Journal of Educational Measurement (JEM), \nEducational  Measurement:  Issues  and  Practice  (EM:IP),  and  Chinese/English  Journal  of \nEducational  Measurement  and  Evaluation (CEJEME). These  journals  publish  peer-reviewed \nscientific articles that are highly respected and widely cited by scholars. Patz Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. 13. A \nsignificant number of articles in these journals use data collected and disseminated by IES and, \ntherefore, could not be published without IES’ continued work. Id. ¶ 15. \nPlaintiffs are already harmed by Defendants’ conduct because it hampers their ability to \nuse IES data for their research publications. Patz ¶¶ 14-15, Ex. 13. These harms are traceable to \nDefendants’ dismantling of IES and would be redressed by an order requiring the restoration of \nIES through promptly reinstating or otherwise providing for new contracts necessary to fulfill \nIES’s congressionally-mandated data-collection obligations, preventing any further vital contract \ncancelations, ensuring no IES data is otherwise destroyed, and restoring IES employee positions \nat least to an amount sufficient to ensure compliance with congressional mandates. This type of \nredress is available to the court in this case. See Nat’l Treas. Emps. Union v. Vought, No. CV 25-\n0381 (ABJ), 2025 WL 942772, at *46 (D.D.C.

Plaintiffs Are Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Their Claims.   \nA. Administrative Procedure Act  \nUnder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), a court may set aside any final agency \naction found to be “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance \nwith law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).  \n1.  Final Agency Action \nUnder the APA, an “action” constitutes “comprehensively every manner in which an \nagency may exercise its power.” Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001). An \nagency’s action is final if it “‘marks the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process’ \nand determines ‘rights or obligations . . . from which legal consequences will flow.” Nat’l Council \nof Nonprofits v. OMB, No. 25-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 368852 at *10 (D.D.C. Feb. 3, 2025) (quoting \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997)). An action marks the consummation of the \nagency’s decisionmaking if the action “is properly attributable to the agency itself” and is not \n“informal, or only the ruling of a subordinate official, or tentative.” Soundboard Ass’n v. FTC, 888 \nF.3d 1261, 1267 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation omitted). \nThe following actions constitute final agency actions reviewable by this court under the \nAPA: (1) the February 10, 2025 announced cancellation of over $900 million in IES contracts, \nsome of which are critical to the basic functioning of IES and to the realization of many IES \ncongressional mandates; (2) the March 11, 2025 announced RIF of 90% of IES staff including \n97% of NCES staff; and (3) the February 2025 termination of all remote restricted-use data licenses \nand the end of accepting new applications for these licenses.   \nIn announcing and carrying out these actions, the agency has made clear that the actions \nare “properly attributable to the agency itself.” Soundboard Ass’n, 888 F.3d at 1267. These actions \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 21 of 34\n     \n \ncannot be said to be informal and are instead clearly final as “[t]here is nothing abstract about \nfiring employees, cutting off the funding stream, terminating contracts, or stopping all work.” Nat’l \nTreas. Emps. Union v. Vought, No. CV 25-0381 (ABJ), 2025 WL 942772, at *13 (D.D.C. Mar. 28, \n2025); see 5 U.S.C. §§ 702, 704. \n2.  Excess of Statutory Authority  \nThe APA  requires  courts  to  set  aside  agency  action  that  is  “in  excess  of  statutory \njurisdiction,  authority,  or  limitations,  or  short  of  statutory right.”  5  U.S.C.  §  706(2)(C).  In \ndetermining whether agency action exceeds statutory authority, “the question . . . is always whether \nthe agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do.” City of Arlington v. F.C.C., 569 \nU.S. 290, 297–98 (2013). \nCongress mandates IES’s Centers to collect and disseminate federal education data and to \nensure  that  it remains  publicly  available.  See  20  U.S.C.  §§  9541–48 (establishing  NCES’s \nobligation to disseminate federal education data); § 9562 (establishing same for NCEE); § 9533 \n(establishing same for NCER); id. § 9567b (establishing same for NCSER); supra; see also Pub. \nL. 110–336, 122 Stat. 3726 (2008) (H.R. 5893) (allocating $807 million to IES and its Centers); \nH.R. 5894, 118th Cong. (2023) (same). IES’s Centers are further required to carry out these \nmandates to a high standard of quality to ensure the accuracy and validity of the data that is \ncollected, maintained, and analyzed. See id. §§ 9512, 9533, 9534, 9541, 6562, 9563, 9567. \nFurthermore, this data must be kept up-to-date and disseminated to the public in a timely manner. \nSee id. §§ 9541, 9562. By acting contrary to these mandates set forth in ESRA; reducing staff at \nIES to such a degree that it renders it virtually impossible to collect, maintain, analyze, and \ndisseminate data; cancelling contracts necessary for the maintenance, analysis, and dissemination \nof data; and restricting Plaintiffs’ and their members’ use of data, Defendants have clearly violated \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 22 of 34\n     \n \ntheir statutory authority. See id.; see also New York v. EPA, 413 F.3d 3, 41 (D.C. Cir. 2005); Bowen, \n488 U.S. at 208. The provisions of ESRA that require data to be high quality, up-to-date, and timely \nnegate any potential argument that the current barebones staff at IES’s Centers could uphold the \nrigorous statutory mandates in ESRA. Ho Decl. ¶ 16, 17, Ex. 10. \nFurthermore, nowhere under ESRA or any other relevant statute has Congress granted \nDefendants the power to dismantle IES or to remove public access to IES data in the manner \ndescribed above. Without clear statutory authority to act, agency action is in excess of statutory \nauthority. See Michigan v. EPA, 268 F.3d 1075, 1081 (D.C. Cir. 2001); see Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. \nBus. v. OSHA, 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). \n3.  Arbitrary and Capricious  \nUnder the APA, courts must “hold unlawful and set aside” agency action that is “arbitrary, \ncapricious, [or] an abuse of discretion.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). Agency action is arbitrary and \ncapricious if the agency “entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem, offered an \nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or [made a decision \nthat] is so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product of agency \nexpertise.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n43 (1983) [“State Farm”].   \nHere, Defendants’ actions, namely, by reducing staff at IES to such a degree that renders it \nvirtually impossible to collect and maintain, analyze and disseminate data; cancelling contracts \nnecessary for the maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data; and restricting Plaintiffs’ and \ntheir members’ use of data, are arbitrary and capricious for at least two reasons: (1) the Department \nfailed to explain this decision in any matter; and (2) the Department failed to consider the harms \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 23 of 34\n     \n \nflowing from the loss of access to up-to-date, reliable educational data of the highest scientific \nstandards.  \nWhen  an  agency  drastically  changes  its  position,  the APA  requires  that  “it  display \nawareness that it is changing position.” F.C.C. v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 \n(2009) (emphasis in original). Therefore, when an agency’s “new policy rests upon factual findings \nthat contradict those which underlay its prior policy,” the agency must provide “a reasoned \nexplanation” for “disregarding facts and circumstances that underlay or were engendered by the \nprior policy.” Id. at 515–16. The agency must also assess whether its prior policy has “engendered \nserious reliance interests,” and if so, consider whether the agency’s other interests and policy \nconcerns outweigh those reliance interests. See Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. Regents of the Univ. of \nCal., 140 S. Ct. 1891, 1913–15 (2020). \nHere, Defendants’ only public statements about their course of conduct fail to offer any \nmeaningful explanation for their decision-making. DOGE’s February 2025 announcement of \ncutting nearly $900 million in contracts is two sentences long and contains no explanation. See Ex. \n19.  Similarly, the Department’s March 2025 announcement of a nearly 50% reduction in force \nreferences only a “commitment to efficiency, accountability, and ensuring that resources are \ndirected where they matter most: to students, parents and teachers,” with no explanation of how \nhalving the staff would achieve this or why it is warranted. Ex. 10. [cite] Nor did the Department \nprovide any explanation of how it anticipated continuing to comply with ERISA, nor of its plan to \nmaintain the quality and availability of the federally-mandated education data in light of these \nsignificant cuts to the workforce. See id. Similarly, the President’s March 2025 Executive Order \ndirecting the Secretary to dismantle the Department describes that the Department has “entrenched \nthe education bureaucracy and sought to convince America that federal control over education is \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 24 of 34\n     \n \nbeneficial” as its central rationale for the dismantling. Ex. 8.. But none of these announcements \nengage in a cost-benefit analysis, acknowledge the reliance interests at stake, or meaningfully \naccount for this drastic change in position that runs counter to the very aim of the Department, and \nits ongoing congressional mandates. These are all hallmarks of arbitrary, ill-reasoned agency action \nunder the APA. See Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 140 S. Ct. at 1913–15 (setting aside agency action \nas arbitrary based on inter alia the failure to consider serious reliance interests); see also Encino \nMotorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. 211, 222–24 (2016) (same); State Farm, 463 U.S. at 51 \n(same).  \nThis lack of explanation also means that the Department did not grapple with less harmful \nalternatives. These public announcements make clear that the Department did not consider why \nany benefits associated with decimating the IES workforce, cancelling contracts, and restricting \nthe availability of data outweigh the significant costs, including the significant reliance interests \nidentified by Plaintiffs, their members, and the communities who rely on the work of Plaintiffs and \ntheir members to better understand IES data. For example, as described above, Professor McCarty \nrelies on the National Indian Education Survey (NIES) throughout her research  on improving \neducation practice and policy for Native American students. See supra; McCarty Decl. ¶¶ 5, 8, 16, \n17, Ex. 16. Professor McCarty has no other way to access this vital data, as it is only collected and \nmaintained by Defendants. Id. ¶ 18. Professors Ho and Readon are similarly negatively impacted. \nProfessors Ho and Reardon rely on EDFacts and the National Assessment of Educational Progress \n(NAEP) for their work on the Educational Opportunity Project, a clearinghouse for data on \neducational achievement across the country. Reardon Decl. ¶ 12-14, Ex. 14; Ho Decl. ¶ 12, Ex. 10. \nNow that the contracts necessary for the collection of these datasets have been cut, Reardon Decl. \n¶ 27, Ex. 14; Ho Decl. ¶ 16, Ex. 10, they will not be able to continue the Educational Opportunity \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 25 of 34\n     \n \nProject, which cannot be maintained without EdFacts and NAEP data. Ho Decl. ¶ 19, Ex. 10. \nNot only will Plaintiffs and their members be harmed by their inability to complete their \nresearch, the students who make up the subject of their research will also be harmed. Without \naccess to this unique federal data, Plaintiffs’ members will not be able to study the educational \noutcomes of all students, including Black, Latino, and Native American students; students with \ndisabilities;  English  language  learners/multilingual  learners;  and  socioeconomically \ndisadvantaged students. See supra. Further, Defendants are the only source of data for educational \noutcomes based on certain demographic characteristics, including Native American identity, and \nthere are no other datasets available to researchers studying related demographic educational \ndisparities. See, e.g., McCarty Decl. ¶ 9, 17, Ex. 16. If Plaintiffs and their members are not able to \nstudy educational disparities based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, limited English \nproficiency, mobility, disability, urban, rural, suburban districts, gender, and other population \ncharacteristics, it will become impossible to create effective policy addressing these disparities and \nclosing any achievement gaps. See, e.g., id. For example, Professor Johnson relies on NAEP data \nfor his research into how to ensure that federal and state funds supplement and not supplant local \neffort to raise funds for Title I schools. See Johnson Decl. ¶ 14, Ex. 11. Lack of access to NAEP \ndata to support this research “may therefore affect the distribution of Title I funding, undermine \nthe effectiveness of the agency’s anti-discrimination enforcement arm that protects students’ civil \nrights, and leave economically disadvantaged students more vulnerable.” Id. These harms were \nclearly not considered by Defendants before they took action to dismantle IES and its research \ncenters. \nDefendants’ explanations and decision-making here, see Exs. 8, 10, 19, was “not so much \na balance of conflicting policy goals as the acceptance of one without any real consideration of the \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 26 of 34\n     \n \nother.”  Nat’l Ass’n of Regul. Util. Comm’rs v. Interstate Com. Comm’n, 41 F.3d 721, 728 (D.C. \nCir. 1994); see also Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union v. Donovan, 722 F.2d 795, 825–26 (D.C. Cir. \n1983); Heartland Hosp. v.

The Defendants’ failure to consider the “broader, \nreal-world impact[s]” of the incapacitation of IES and its data collection and research functions \nwas, therefore, arbitrary and capricious. American Wild Horse Pres. Campaign v. Perdue, 873 F.3d \n914, 931 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \n4.  Not in Accordance with Law  \nFor all the reasons why the removal of data exceeds the Department’s statutory authority, \nit is also not in accordance with law under the APA. See F.C.C. v. NextWave Pers. Commc’ns, Inc., \n537 U.S. 293, 300 (2003) (“The Administrative Procedure Act requires federal courts to set aside \nfederal agency action that is ‘not in accordance with law’ which means, of course, any law . . .” \n(citation omitted)); Match-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. \n209, 220 (2012) (holding that an agency acts “not in accordance with law” when it “violates a \nfederal statute”); see supra pp. 21–22. \nB.  Separation of Powers \n“[W]henever a separation-of-powers violation occurs, any aggrieved party with standing \nmay file a constitutional challenge.” Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 245 (2021); see also Free \nEnter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010); Boumediene v. Bush, \n553 U.S. 723, 743 (2008) (private plaintiffs may “enforce separation-of-powers principles”); INS \nv. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 958–59 (1983). And “where one branch has impaired or sought to assume \na power central to another branch, the Court has not hesitated to enforce the doctrine.” Chadha, \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 27 of 34\n     \n \n462  U.S.  at  962–63.  Because  Plaintiffs  have Article III  standing,  supra,  they  may  bring  a \nseparation-of-powers claim. \nDefendants have failed to faithfully execute constitutional statutes and actively impeded \ntheir implementation. Defendants have reduced staff at IES to such a degree that renders it virtually \nimpossible to collect and maintain, analyze and disseminate data. Defendants have cancelled the \ncontracts necessary for the maintenance, analysis, and dissemination of data, as well as, restricted \nPlaintiffs’ and their members’ use of data. In doing so, Defendants, an executive agency and \nexecutive branch official, have usurped Congress’s lawmaking authority. “But the President may \nnot decline to follow a statutory mandate or prohibition simply because of policy objections.” In \nre Aiken County, 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Article I of the Constitution vests Congress \nwith “[a]ll legislative powers[,]” U.S. Const. art. I, § 1, including the power to enact, amend, and \nrepeal statutes, Chadha, 462 U.S. at 954. Concurrently, the Constitution mandates the Executive \nBranch “take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed[.]” U.S. Const. art. II, § 1.  \nIn  hamstringing  IES’s  ability  to  fulfill  its  congressional  mandates,  Defendants  have \nviolated their constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause and dramatically infringed on \nCongress’s legislative power by refusing to enforce a duly enacted statute and actively impeding \nits operation. The Constitution instructs that the President and executive agencies, including \nDefendants, “shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Id. “In the framework of our \nConstitution, the President’s power to see that the laws are faithfully executed refutes the idea that \nhe is to be a lawmaker.” Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 587 (1952). In \nviolating and otherwise declining to enforce valid federal laws, Defendants are overstepping their \nconstitutional limits and duties. See Wudajyswara v. Lake, 2025 WL 1166400 at *15 (D.D.C. 2025) \n(citing  Wudajyswara  v.  Lake,  2025  WL  945869  at  *7  (S.D.N.Y.  2025))  (“Withholding \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 28 of 34\n     \n \ncongressionally appropriated funds, and effectively shuttering a congressionally created agency \nsimply cannot be construed as following through on [the] constitutional mandate [of the Take Care \nClause]”). \nDefendants have conducted mass firings and cancelled hundreds of millions of dollars in \ncontracts that IES needs to fulfill its congressional mandates, including cancelling the contract for \nthe completion of the NAEP, which Plaintiffs’ members rely on in their research. See supra pp. 8–\n10, 13–14. Additionally, Defendants have taken steps to restrict the availability of accessible data \nin direct contravention of Congress’s mandate to make the datasets publicly accessible. For \nexample, NCES informed Professor Bastedo, that all applications for restricted-use data, including \nhis own application, were on pause until further notice. Bastedo Decl. ¶ 13, Ex. 1. Without the \nrestricted-use license, he has no other way of continuing his research project. Id. ¶ 14.  \nThrough  these  actions,  Defendants  have  unjustifiably  failed  to  enforce  several \ncongressional mandates and actively impeded their implementation. See In re Aiken Cnty., 725 \nF.3d at 259; see also League of United Latin Am. Citizens v. Exec. Off. of the President, 2025 WL \n1187730 at *37 (D.D.C. Apr. 24, 2025) (“[T]he President's power is at its lowest ebb because his \nunilateral instruction . . . is contrary to the manifest will of Congress, as expressed in the text, \nstructure, and context [of the agency statute]”) (cleaned up)). These mandates include those set \nforth in the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, which provided $793.1 million in \nfunds for “necessary expense for the Institute of Education Sciences” to “remain available through \nSeptember 30, 2025,” which was then extended by continuing resolution on March 15, 2025. See \nPub. L. 118-47, 138 Stat. 693 (Mar. 23, 2024); see also Pub. L. 119-4, 139 Stat. 9 (Mar. 15, 2025). \n“Of course, an agency is not free simply to disregard statutory responsibilities: Congress may \nalways circumscribe agency discretion to allocate resources by putting restrictions in the operative \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 29 of 34\n     \n \nstatutes. . . .” Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 193 (1993); see also City & Cnty. of S.F. v. Trump, \n897 F.3d 1225, 1235 (9th Cir. 2018) (“Absent congressional authorization, the Administration may \nnot redistribute or withhold properly appropriated funds in order to effectuate its own policy goals. \nBecause Congress did not authorize withholding of funds, the Executive Order violates the \nconstitutional principle of the Separation of Powers.”).  \nIII.  The Balance of the Equities Tip Towards Plaintiffs Because Plaintiffs Face Irreparable \nHarm, the Public Interest Will Be Served by the Injunction, and the Injunction Would \nnot Harm Defendants. \n \nWhere, as here, the government is the party opposing a motion for a preliminary injunction, \nthe balance of equities and public-interest factors merge. Miranda v. Garland, 34 F.4th 338, 365 \n(4th Cir. 2022) (quoting Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). Considering the irreparable \nharm posed by Defendants’ conduct to both Plaintiffs, their members and to the public interest, the \nbalance of the equities favor Plaintiffs.  \nAn injury constitutes irreparable harm when it is “both certain and great,” “actual and not \ntheoretical,” and “of such imminence that there is a ‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief.” \nChaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (quoting Wis. \nGas  Co.  v.  FERC,  758  F.2d  669,  674  (D.C.  Cir.  1985)  (per  curiam)).  “[O]bstacles  [that] \nunquestionably make it more difficult for the [plaintiff] to accomplish [its] primary mission ... \nprovide injury for purposes ... [of] irreparable harm.” League of Women Voters of the U.S. v. Newby, \n838 F.3d 1, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2016).  \nPlaintiffs and their members suffer significant irreparable harm from Defendants’ actions, \nand, absent preliminary relief, will continue to face this harm due to their inability to continue their \nresearch that relies on access to the Department’s databases. See supra. Lack of timely access to \ninformation to which plaintiffs are entitled may constitute irreparable harm. See, e.g., Am. Immigr. \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 30 of 34\n     \n \nCouncil v. DHS, 470 F. Supp. 3d 32, 37–38 (D.D.C. 2020); Nat’l Ass’n of the Deaf v. Trump, 486 \nF. Supp. 3d 45, 58 (D.D.C. 2020). This is particularly true where, like Plaintiffs and their members, \norganizations and their members are deprived of access to statutorily required information that \nthey rely on to conduct routine business activities, such as research and teaching. See, e.g., Doctors \nfor Am. v. OPM, CV 25-322 (JDB), 2025 WL 452707 at *8–9 (D.D.C. Feb. 11, 2025) (finding that \nplaintiff  organization’s  members  suffered  irreparable  harm  by  “defendants’  removal  of  the \nwebpages and datasets,” which the members relied upon for their research and work); cf. Jewell, \n824 F.3d at 1041 (finding that an animal-rights group suffered harm by the Secretary of the \nInterior’s failure to disclose information under the Endangered Species Act because the group \nwould have used the information to “meaningfully participate in the Act's permitting process, as \nwell as engage in related advocacy efforts.”). \nHere, Plaintiffs and their members rely on Department data to conduct research, publish \narticles, and develop curriculum. See supra pp. 11–19; Tipton Decl. ¶¶ 12, 17, 18-20, Ex. 31; \nJohnson Decl. ¶¶ 10, 12, Ex. 11; Briggs Decl. ¶ 9, Ex. 12; Bastedo Decl. ¶ 10, Ex. 1; McCarty \nDecl. ¶¶ 8, 9, 11, 12, 18, Ex. 16; Worell Decl. ¶¶ 9, 11, Ex. 24; Barnett Decl. ¶¶ 5-6, Ex. 23. As \ndescribed above, restricted access to this data, or compromises to the integrity of this data, will \nsignificantly hinder Plaintiffs’ and their members’ research, publishing, and teaching, resulting in \nirreparable harm, cf. Wis. Gas. Co., 758 F.2d at 674 (finding that economic harm can “constitute \nirreparable harm ... where the loss threatens the very existence of the movant's business”). \n While Plaintiffs suffer certain and irreparable injury due to Defendants’ unlawful actions, \nDefendants would suffer no cognizable harm if required to restore IES’s research and data-\ncollection  processes  to  comply  with  federal  law.  Defendants  “cannot  suffer  harm  from  an \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 31 of 34\n     \n \ninjunction that merely ends an unlawful practice.” C.G.B. v. Wolf, 464 F. Supp. 3d 174, 218 (D.D.C. \n2020) (quoting Open Communities All. v. Carson, 286 F. Supp. 3d 148, 179 (D.D.C. 2017)).  \nNot only can there be no harm to Defendants in ending unlawful government action, but \nneither can there be any public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action. Open \nCommunities All., 286 F. Supp. 3d at 179 (citation omitted). “To the contrary, there is a substantial \npublic interest in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws.” Id. Beyond the general \npublic interest in requiring the Department to comply with congressional mandates, there is a \nparticularly strong public interest in requiring the Department to comply with congressional \nmandates to provide public access to up-to-date federal education data. IES data fuels not only \nPlaintiffs’ research, but also the research of professors and other academics around the country. \nThis data is also necessary for determining federal-aid calculations, grants to localities, recipients’ \ncompliance efforts, and Census Bureau statistics.  \nKey examples of how IES data is used to benefit the public include maintaining: (1) the \nWWC, which provides evidence-based recommendations, including practice guides for educators \nto improve student outcomes. Ex. 7; (2) the CCD, a comprehensive, annual, national database of \nall public elementary and secondary schools and school districts.  Ex. 25 ; (3) the Private School \nUniverse Survey, the primary database on all private elementary and secondary education in the \nUS,  Private  School  Universe  Survey  (PSS),  Nat’l  Ctr.  for  Educ.  Stat., \nhttps://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pss/#:~:text=This%20is%20the%20Private%20School%20Universe\n%20Survey%20site%2C,download%20questionnaires%2C%20and%20search%20the%20privat\ne%20school%20locator (last visited Apr. 29, 2025), Ex. 26; (4) NAEP, the nation’s report card on \nstudent achievement in the US, at the national and state levels as well as trends over time. Ex. 27; \n(5) the TIMSS, which provides reliable and timely trend data on U.S. students’ mathematics and \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 32 of 34\n     \n \nscience achievement as compared with students in other countries. , Ex. 28; (6) the Program for \nInternational Student Assessment, along with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment, administers international assessments that measure 15-year-old students' reading, \nmathematics, and science literacy, Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), Nat’l \nCtr. for Educ. Stat., https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pisa/ (last visited Apr. 29, 2025), Ex. 29; and (6) \nthe ELS, which include different surveys over time of early childhood and elementary grades, \nmiddle grades, high schools, and postsecondary. Ex. 6. The above examples are only a few of the \nnumerous  ways IES datasets are used. Plaintiffs, their members, and many other education \nresearchers, rely on these and other Department particularly in their research and teaching. See \nsupra pp. 12–14. \nIES data also plays a critical role in ensuring that federal funding is equitably allocated to \nhigh-need schools through, among other grants, the Rural Education Achievement Program \n(REAP) and Title I grants. Ex. 22. For these and other grants, NCES works with the U.S. Census \nBureau to analyze school-district boundaries, income levels, and other characteristics that help the \nDepartment determine grant eligibility. Id. Not only are these datasets necessary for determining \ngrant spending, but they also provide invaluable information into federal spending, more generally \nensuring  that  federal  funds  are  being  employed  effectively  to  achieve  educational  success \nnationwide.  \nLosing access to these datasets will create irreparable and growing harm to our country for \nyears to come. Without IES data, the U.S. educational system will be without information \nnecessary to guide policy or test educational system efficacy. There will be no way to make sure \nthat whole states or other subgroups of students, such as those based on race, do not fall behind. \nBlack,  Latino,  and  Native American  students,  students  with  disabilities,  English  language \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 14-1     Filed 05/02/25     Page 33 of 34\n     \n \nlearners/multilingual learners, and socioeconomically disadvantaged students will be at greatest \nrisk  of  harm from  lack  of  informational  oversight  into  an  educational  system  where  these \nmarginalized students are already disadvantaged. Federal data on educational disparities is crucial \nto creating policies that can effectively close achievement gaps. Without this data, our nation’s \nchildren will risk receiving an ineffective education that would place our country at a competitive \ndisadvantage globally and create serious national security risks. These deleterious impacts make \nclear that Defendants’ actions are extreme and without regard to the public benefit. \n The  balance  of  equities  thus  weighs  decisively  in  favor  of  granting  a  preliminary \ninjunction. The requested relief is vital to prevent irreparable harm to Plaintiffs, the national \neducation system, and the future of our country’s workforce and national security.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs ask this court to issue a preliminary injunction against \nDefendants. \n \nDated: May 2, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nAmy I.

Gov’t Mot. Stay, ECF No. 16 (citing Ass’n for Educ. Finance & Pol’y, Inc., et al. v. \nDep’t of Educ., 25-cv-999 (D.D.C. Apr. 4, 2025)).  Plaintiffs oppose.  Pl. Opp. Mot. Stay, ECF \nNo. 17.  The Court declines to stay this case for the following reasons. \n“[T]he power to stay proceedings is incidental to the power inherent in every court to \ncontrol the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time and effort for itself, for \ncounsel, and for litigants.”  Landis v. N. American Co., 299 U.S. 248, 255 (1936).  “Only in rare \ncircumstances will a litigant in one cause be compelled to stand aside while a litigant in another \nsettles the rule of law that will define the rights of both. . . . [T]he suppliant for a stay must make \nout a clear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward . . . .”  Id.   \nDefendants have not carried their burden to show hardship from moving forward.  \n“[B]eing required to defend a suit, without more, does not constitute a clear case of hardship or \ninequity.”  Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Ross, 419 F. Supp. 3d 16, 21 (D.D.C. 2019).  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 18     Filed 05/06/25     Page 2 of 2\nDefendants have cited only the “time and resources” of litigating parallel cases; in other words, \n“being required to defend a suit.”  Mot. Stay, ECF No. 16, at 4.   \nDefendants’ assertions to the contrary are unsuccessful.  Their best argument is comity.  \nIn situations where two different courts face nearly the same case, comity counsels a later-filed \ncourt to stay pending litigation to avoid conflicting injunctions with an earlier-filed case in \nanother court.  Common Cause v. Judicial Ethics Comm., 473 F. Supp. 1251, 1253-54 (D.D.C. \n1979).  But comity’s motivating concerns do not exist here because both matters are before the \nsame Court.  Defendants also proffer cases discouraging “duplicative” and “parallel” litigation, \nbut these are inapposite because they generally involve the same parties across multiple cases.  \nE.g., Holland v. ACL Transp. Servs., LLC, 815 F. Supp. 2d 46, 55 (D.D.C. 2011); Columbia \nPlaza Corp. v. Sec. Nat. Bank, 525 F.2d 620, 626 (D.C. Cir. 1975).  The cases at bar involve \ndifferent educational nonprofits and professional organizations.  Compare Compl., ECF No. 1, at \n4–5 (listing National Academy of Education and National Council on Measurement in Education \nas plaintiffs) with Ass’n for Educ. Finance & Pol’y, Inc., Compl., ECF No. 1, at 23–27 (listing \nEducation Finance and Policy and the Institute for Higher Education Policy as plaintiffs). \nAccordingly, Defendants have not shown that this is the “rare circumstance[]” that merits \nstaying one case so that Plaintiffs must watch others settle a rule of law that may control their \nrights.   \nThe motion to stay is DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED. \n           \nDated: May 6, 2025        TREVOR N.

Plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits, that they have suffered irreparable harm, and that the balance \nof the equities or the public interest tip in their favor.  The Court should deny Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor preliminary injunction. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nThe Department of Education was established as part of the Department of Education \nOrganization Act.  Pub. L. No. 96-88, 93 Stat. 668 (1979).  The purpose of the Department is \nprincipally   \n(1) to strengthen the Federal commitment to ensuring access to equal educational \nopportunity for every individual; (2) to supplement and complement the efforts of \nStates, the local school systems and other instrumentalities of the States, the private \nsector, public and private educational institutions, public and private nonprofit \neducational research institutions, community-based organizations, parents, and \nstudents  to  improve  the  quality  of  education;  (3)  to  encourage  the  increased \ninvolvement of the public, parents, and students in Federal education programs; (4) \nto promote improvements in the quality and usefulness of education through \nfederally supported research, evaluation, and sharing of information; (5) to improve \nthe coordination of Federal education programs; (6) to improve the management \nand efficiency of Federal education activities, especially with respect to the process, \nprocedures, and administrative structures for the dispersal of Federal funds, as well \nas the reduction of unnecessary and duplicative burdens and constraints, including \nunnecessary paperwork, on the recipients of Federal funds; and (7) to increase the \naccountability of Federal education programs to the President, the Congress, and \nthe public. \n20 U.S.C. § 3402. \nUnder the Education Sciences Reform Act, 20 U.S.C. §§ 9501-9584 (the “Act”), Congress \nestablished an Institute of Education Sciences (the “Institute”) within the Department to: \ncompile statistics, develop products, and conduct research, evaluations, and wide \ndissemination  activities  in  areas  of  demonstrated  national  need  (including  in \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 12 of 50\ntechnology areas) that are supported by Federal funds appropriated to the Institute \nand ensure that such activities-- (A) conform to high standards of quality, integrity, \nand accuracy; and (B) are objective, secular, neutral, and nonideological and are \nfree of partisan political influence and racial, cultural, gender, or regional bias.  \n20 U.S.C. § 9511(b)(2).  The Act also established within the Institute four centers: the National \nCenter for Education Research, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Center \nfor Education Evaluation and Regional Assistance, and the National Center for Special Education \nResearch and delineated the duties for each center.  Id. §§ 9511-9567.  \n  Additionally, the Act states that the Institute shall “[d]isseminat[e] information in a timely \nfashion and in formats that are easily accessible and usable by researchers, practitioners, and the \ngeneral  public”  and  “[u]tiliz[e]  the  most  modern  technology  and  other  methods  available, \nincluding  arrangements  to  use  data  collected  electronically  by  States  and  local  educational \nagencies, to ensure the efficient collection and timely distribution of information, including data \nand reports,” and “[m]ak[e] information available to the public in an expeditious fashion.”  Id. \n§ 9575(2), (3), (6).  Additionally, “data collected by the Institute, including any office, board, \ncommittee, or center of the Institute, in carrying out the priorities and mission of the Institute, shall \nbe made available to the public, including through use of the Internet.”  Id. § 9574.  \nII.  Factual Background \nOn February 26, 2025, the President signed the “Implementing the President’s ‘Department \nof Government Efficiency’ Cost Efficiency Initiative” Executive Order.  Exec. Order No. 14,222, \n90 Fed. Reg. 11,095 (Feb. 26, 2025) (the “Contract Executive Order”).  The purpose of this order \nwas to “commence[] a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to ensure \nGovernment spending is transparent and Government employees are accountable to the American \npublic.”    Id.  §  1.    Accordingly,  this  Executive  Order  instructed  “[e]ach  Agency  Head,  in \nconsultation with the agency’s DOGE Team Lead, [to] review all existing covered contracts and \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 13 of 50\ngrants and, where appropriate and consistent with applicable law,” “terminate or modify (including \nthrough renegotiation) such covered contracts and grants to reduce overall Federal spending or \nreallocate  spending  to  promote  efficiency  and  advance  the  policies  of  [the  President’s] \nAdministration.”  Id. § 3(b).  Covered contracts are defined as among other things, “discretionary \nspending through Federal contracts,” but excludes “direct assistance to individuals; expenditures \nrelated  to  immigration  enforcement,  law  enforcement,  the  military,  public  safety,  and  the \nintelligence community; and other critical, acute, or emergency spending, as determined by the \nrelevant Agency Head.”  Id. § 2(d).  The Executive Order instructed the process to “commence \nimmediately” and to “prioritize the review of funds disbursed under covered contracts and grants \nto educational institutions . . . for waste, fraud, and abuse.”  Id. \nOn  March  20,  2025,  the  President  signed  the  “Improving  Education  Outcomes  by \nEmpowering Parents, States, and Communities” Executive Order.  Exec. Order No. 14,242, \n90 Fed. Reg. 13,679 (Mar. 20, 2025) (the “Department Executive Order”).  The Department \nExecutive  Order  found  that  the  “Department  of  Education  has  entrenched  the  education \nbureaucracy” that “is not working.”  Id. § 1.  For example, the Order identified the Department of \nEducation’s “public relations office that includes over 80 staffers at a cost of more than $10 million \nper year.”  Id.  Ultimately, the Order contemplates that the “[c]losure of the Department of \nEducation would drastically improve program implementation in higher education” and “would \nprovide children and their families the opportunity to escape a system that is failing them.” Id. \nUnder the Department Executive Order, the Secretary of Education was ordered “to the \nmaximum extent appropriate and permitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure \nof the Department of Education.”  Exec. Order No. 14,242 § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,679.  The \n“Secretary of Education shall ensure that the allocation of any Federal Department of Education \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 14 of 50\nfunds is subject to rigorous compliance with Federal law.”  Id. § 2(b).  And the Department \nExecutive Order states that it should “be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject \nto the availability of appropriations.” Id. § 3(b). \nThe Secretary has stated she intends to do “an overhaul” of the Department.  U.S. Dep’t of \nEduc.,  Secretary  McMahon:  Our  Department's  Final  Mission  (Mar.  3,  2025), \nhttps://www.ed.gov/about/news/speech/secretary-mcmahon-our-departments-final-mission.    As \npart of the overhaul, the Department is implementing a reduction in force, which impacts “[a]ll \ndivisions within the Department,” and some divisions will require “significant reorganization to \nbetter serve students, parents, educators, and taxpayers.”  U.S. Dep’t of Educ., U.S. Department of \nEducation  Initiates  Reduction  in  Force  (Mar.  11,  2025), \nhttps://www.ed.gov/about/news/pressrelease/us-department-of-education-initiates-reduction-\nforce (“RIF Press Release”).  The purpose of the reduction in force is “efficiency, accountability, \nand  ensuring  that  resources  are  directed  where  they  matter  most:  to  students,  parents,  and \nteachers.”  Id.  It is “the first step of eliminating . . . bureaucratic bloat,” Filip Timotija, Education \nsecretary:  Mass  layoffs  first  step  toward  total  shutdown,  The  Hill  (Mar.  12,  2025), \nhttps://thehill.com/homenews/education/5190161-lindamcmahon-education-department-mass-\nlayoffs/ (“Hill Article”).  The Department intends to “ke[ep] all of the right people and the good \npeople to make sure that the outward-facing programs . . . the grants, the appropriations that come \nfrom Congress, all of that are being met, and none of that’s going to fall through the cracks.”  Id.  \nAs part of the reduction in force, any staff that may be separated will first be put on administrative \nleave. RIF Press Release. \nAfter the overhaul, the Department has stated that it “will continue to deliver on all \nstatutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview.”  RIF Press Release.  The Secretary stated \n- 4 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 15 of 50\nthat she planned to keep fifty percent of the Department “related to expenditures and key \nprograms” for which Congress has appropriated money.  Ingraham Angle, Education secretary \nsays department took first steps to eliminate ‘bureaucratic bloat’, Fox News (Mar. 11, 2025), \nhttps://www.foxnews.com/video/6369901522112. \nLonger term, Secretary McMahon recognizes that shutting down the Department will \nrequire “work with Congress.”  Hill Article.  The Secretary plans to partner with Congress and \nother federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President \nand the American people.  Lexi Lonas Cochran, Linda McMahon gives Education staffers their \n‘final  mission’,  The  Hill  (Mar.  4,  2025),  https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5175086-\nlindamcmahon-education-department-trump-musk/.  \nPlaintiffs in this case, the National Academy of Education (the “Academy”) and the \nNational Council on Measurement in Education (the “Council”), are membership organizations \nwhose members they allege “rely on data to study a wide variety of pressing education issues.”  \nCompl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 12; see also id. ¶ 13.  Plaintiffs allege that their members rely on unique \nDepartment data for numerous research projects.  Id. ¶¶ 78-93.  They allege that “Defendants have \ncancelled contracts impacting the collection, analysis and dissemination” of the data Plaintiffs’ \nmembers need for their research and that as a result “of these cancellations, the Department is \nunable  to  collect,  analyze,  and  disseminate  these  datasets  in  accordance  with  its  statutory \nmandates, and Plaintiffs and their members will be unable to obtain and utilize these datasets.”  Id. \n¶ 94.  According to Plaintiffs, their members’ ability to access accurate data is also impacted \nbecause “Defendants indefinitely delayed their processing of new restricted-use licenses” and \n“because of the significant reduction in force[.]”  Id. ¶¶ 95-96.  Without access to that data, they \nallege, they suffer irreparable harm.  Id. ¶ 97. \n- 5 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 16 of 50\nIII.  Procedural Background \nOn April 24, 2025, Plaintiffs brought a five-count Complaint, alleging that: (1) Defendants \nhave exceeded their statutory authority in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(C) (“APA”), id. ¶¶ 101-08 (Count 1); (2) Defendants’ actions are arbitrary and capricious \nin violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), id. ¶¶ 109-18 (Count 2); (3) Defendants’ actions \nare not in accordance with law in violation of the APA, 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), id. ¶¶ 119-24; (4) a \nseparation-of-powers claim, U.S. Const. art. I §§ 1, 4, id. ¶¶ 125-31 (Count 4), and (5) an ultra \nvires agency action claim, id. ¶¶ 132-35 (Count 5), id. ¶¶ 132-35.  Plaintiffs ask the Court for a \ndeclaration that Defendants have violated the APA; an injunction ordering Defendants “to reinstate \ncancelled contracts” or to “re-bid the contracts,” refrain from “destroying datasets,” reinstate \nemployees, pay attorney’s fees, and other relief the Court deems just and proper.  Id. ¶¶ 136-41. \n  On May 2, 2025, Plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction.  They ask the Court to order \nDefendants to “maintain” and not to “destroy” any “datasets, including by cancelling or otherwise \nfailing to fulfill vendor contracts,” reinstate and maintain” the Institute’s “data collection, analysis, \nand dissemination activities,” and reinstate the canceled contracts and employees.  Proposed Order \n(ECF No. 14-34) at 1-2. \nLEGAL STANDARDS \nA preliminary injunction is an “extraordinary and drastic remedy” that should “never [be] \nawarded as of right.”  Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 689–90 (2008) (citation omitted).  To warrant \nrelief, the movant must satisfy a four-prong test, establishing “that he is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the \nbalance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.”  Winter v. Nat. \nRes. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008); accord Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. \n- 6 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 17 of 50\nCir. 2011).  The third and fourth factors of the analysis—harm to others and the public interest— \n“merge when the Government is the opposing party.”  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely To Succeed On The Merits. \nA.  The Court Lacks Subject-Matter Jurisdiction. \n1.  Plaintiff’s Lack Article III Standing. \nStanding is a “bedrock constitutional requirement.”  United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. 670, \n675 (2023).  It requires that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” in the outcome, which “helps \nensure that courts decide litigants’ legal rights in specific cases, as Article III requires.”  Food & \nDrug Admin. v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 379 (2024).  Standing doctrine thus \n“serves to protect the ‘autonomy’ of those who are most directly affected so that they can decide \nwhether and how to challenge the defendant’s action.”  Id. at 379–80.  The standing doctrine \nfurther ensures that “‘the Framers’ concept of the proper—and properly limited—role of the courts \nin a democratic society’ is vindicated, by ensuring decisions meant for the political process are left \nto the political process.”  Coal. for Humane Immigrant Rts. v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., Civ. A. \nNo. 25-0943 (TNM), 2025 WL 1078776, at *4 (D.D.C. Apr. 10, 2025) (quoting John Roberts, \nArticle III Limits on Statutory Standing, 42 Duke L. J. 1219, 1220 (1993)). \nUnder any theory of standing, “the irreducible constitutional minimum” requires that, (1) \nthe plaintiff have suffered an “injury in fact” that is “concrete and particularized” and “actual or \nimminent, not conjectural or hypothetical”; (2) there must exist “a causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of”; and (3) it must be “likely, as opposed to merely speculative, \nthat the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.”  Friends of Animals v. Jewell, 828 F.3d \n989, 991–92 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (quoting Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)).  \nImportantly, standing is “not dispensed in gross.”  Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 734 (2008) \n- 7 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 18 of 50\n(quotation marks omitted).  “Rather, a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks \nto press and for each form of relief that is sought.”  Id.  (quotation marks omitted). \nMembership-based associations like Plaintiffs can establish standing in one of two ways: \nthey can assert “associational standing” to sue on behalf of their members, see Hunt v. Wash. State \nApple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977), or “organizational standing” to sue on behalf \nof themselves, see People for Ethical Treatment of Animals v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric. (“PETA”), \n797 F.3d 1087, 1093 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Plaintiffs can also demonstrate informational standing.  \nFEC v. Akins, 524 U.S. 11, 25 (1998).  Plaintiffs here fail to demonstrate any kind of standing. \n(a) Plaintiffs Fail to Demonstrate Organization Standing. \nTo establish organizational standing, a plaintiff must demonstrate “that the defendant’s \nactions cause a ‘concrete and demonstrable injury to the organization’s activities’ that is ‘more \nthan simply a setback to the organization’s abstract social interests.’”  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr. v. \nPresidential Advisory Comm’n on Election Integrity, 878 F.3d 371, 378 (D.C. Cir. 2017) (cleaned \nup).  “For an organizational plaintiff to demonstrate that it has suffered an injury in fact, it must \nshow ‘more than a frustration of its purpose,’ since mere hindrance to a nonprofit’s mission ‘is the \ntype of abstract concern that does not impart standing.’”  Coal. for Humane Immigrant Rts, 2025 \nWL 1078776, at *4 (quoting Food & Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack, 808 F.3d 905, 919 (D.C. Cir. \n2015) (cleaned up)).  Thus, to determine whether a plaintiff’s allegations are sufficient to convey \norganizational standing, a court must find that the plaintiff satisfied two prongs: (1) the defendants’ \n“action or omission . . . injured [the plaintiff’s] interest;” and (2) that the plaintiff “used its \nresources to counteract that harm.”  Elec. Priv. Info. Ctr., 878 F.3d at 378 (quoting PETA, 797 \nF.3d at 1094). \nCritically,  here,  the  Complaint  contains  no  allegations  that  either  plaintiff  “used  its \nresources to counteract the harm” of which Plaintiffs complain.  See generally Compl. (ECF No. \n- 8 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 19 of 50\n1).  Plaintiffs’ brief likewise is silent on the second prong.  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 18-19.  Nor \ndo they acknowledge the second prong.  Id.  At best, Plaintiffs offer a single statement, that the \nCouncil has “committed over $50,000 in funds to support [its] members facing these challenges.” \nMot. Ex. 13, Patz Decl. (ECF No. 14-15) ¶ 22. \nIf the second prong were not already fatal to Plaintiffs’ organizational standing, Plaintiffs \nalso fail the first prong.  “To allege an injury to its interest, an organization must allege that the \ndefendant’s conduct perceptibly impaired the organization’s ability to provide services in order to \nestablish injury in fact.”  Food & Water Watch, 808 F.3d at 919 (quoting Turlock Irrigation Dist. \nv. FERC, 786 F.3d 18, 24 (D.C. Cir. 2015)) (cleaned up).  “An organization’s ability to provide \nservices has been perceptibly impaired when the defendant’s conduct causes an inhibition of [the \norganization’s] daily operations.”  Id. (cleaned up). \nPlaintiffs here assert that they “utilize [the] statutorily-required data to carry out their core \nactivities,” which for the Council consists of “regularly publishing three journals” and holding an \nannual conference to discuss research, both of which Plaintiff claims have been affected by the \nInstitute’s status.  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 18, 19; Ex. 13, Patz. Decl. (ECF No. 14-15) ¶¶ 14, \n17.  As for the Academy, Carole Lee, President of the Academy, states it carries out its missions \nby pointing to three examples of research projects that rely on Institute data and have been affected \nby the Institute’s status. Mot. Ex. 30, Lee Decl. (ECF No. 14-32) ¶¶ 9-11).   \n But pointing to these purported difficulties with research and publication does not satisfy \neither the Council’s or the Academy’s burden to show its mission has been “perceptibly impaired” \nby the Institute’s status.  PETA, 797 F.3d at 1094.  None of the offered declarants state that their \npublication or research have been eliminated or no longer published or performed because of the \nstatus of the Institute’s programs.  The Council Executive Director Richard Patz declares, for \n- 9 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 20 of 50\nexample, that without the Institute’s data collections and research, the Council “will publish less \nresearch in its journals.”  Mot. Ex. 11, Patz Decl. (ECF No. 14-15) ¶ 15.  He concludes that the \nunavailability of data “diminish[es]” the Council’s “ability to produce, publish and disseminate \nscholarship” or that there will otherwise be “substantial risks” to the programs on which the \nCouncil relies.  Id. ¶¶ 19, 20.  Lee similarly states that without access to the data the Academy \n“will be limited in its ability to advance the high-quality research relied upon by scholars, \neducators, advocates and the general public to improve education policy and practice.”  Id. ¶ 12.   \nIn this way, the mere fact that the Institute’s status may make it more difficult for their \noperations does not meet either Plaintiff’s burden to establish organizational standing.  See Coal. \nFor Humane Immigrant Rts., 2025 WL 1078776, at *6 (organizational standing not satisfied where \nchallenged government action merely “has made [] advocacy efforts more difficult to achieve” \n(cleaned up)).  Nor do Plaintiffs explain any limiting principle under which standing would not \narise for every entity and individual as to every downstream ripple effect of every fluctuation in a \ngovernment agency’s operations. \n(b) Plaintiffs and their Members Fail to Demonstrate Information Standing. \nTo show informational standing, Plaintiffs have the burden of proving two elements: “(1) \nit has been deprived of information that, on its interpretation, a statute requires the government or \na third party to disclose to it, and (2) it suffers, by being denied access to that information, the type \nof harm Congress sought to prevent by requiring disclosure.” Friends of Animals, 828 F.3d at 992 \n(cleaned  up).  Nonetheless,  “[a]ny  informational  injury  still  must  meet  the  traceability  and \nredressability prongs of the traditional standing analysis.”  Architects & Eng’rs for 9/11 Truth v. \nRaimondo, Civ. A. No. 21-2365 (TNM), 2022 WL 3042181, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 2, 2022) (citing \nAkins, 524 U.S. at 25), aff’d, No. 22-5267, 2023 WL 6439491 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 3, 2023).  \n- 10 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 21 of 50\nEven if Plaintiffs or their members could show an informational injury—only one part of \nthe chain they must show for standing—in many cases they cannot connect it to a statutory \nviolation  rather  than  a  permissible  exercise  of  discretion.    “The  decision  to  undertake  a \nreorganization necessitating a [reduction in force] is within the discretion of the agency,” McKenna \nv. Dep’t of Interior, 996 F.2d 1235 (Fed. Cir. 1993).  And any other programmatic decisions \nregarding the Institute’s handling of its statutorily required duties or responsibilities are likewise \ncommitted to agency discretion.  Lujan v. Nat’l Wildlife Fed., 497 U.S. 871, 891 (1990); Norton \nv. S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  Yet Plaintiffs ask this Court to insert itself into \nthis process, and, in the name of equity, issue a programmatic injunction freezing in place the \nDepartment’s programmatic structure, personnel, and organization.  And Plaintiffs ask this Court \nto do so notwithstanding the Secretary’s differing judgment about how the Institute should operate.  \nHaving crossed—in Plaintiffs’ mind—some threshold for organization and programmatic change \nthat is as unarticulated as it is inarticulable, Plaintiffs ask this Court to step in and manage the \nDepartment’s day-to-day operations.  That is not the law. \n(c) Plaintiffs Lack Associational Standing. \nTo show associational standing, an organization must demonstrate that “(1) at least one of \nits members would have standing to sue in his own right, (2) the interests the association seeks to \nprotect are germane to its purpose, and (3) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested \nrequires that an individual member of the association participate in the lawsuit.”  Sierra Club v. \nEPA, 292 F.3d 895, 898 (D.C. Cir. 2002). \nFirst,  as  noted  above,  the  individual  members  are  unable  to  establish  informational \nstanding, and therefore Plaintiffs’ claim to associational standing on this basis fails for the same \nreasons noted above. \n- 11 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 22 of 50\nSecond, other harms articulated by the declarants, such as their purported inability to \nprovide relevant research and information to policymakers and legislators, is precisely the sort of \n“highly attenuated chain of possibilities” that “does not satisfy the requirement that threatened \ninjury must be certainly impending.”  Clapper v. Amnesty Intern. USA, 568 U.S. 398, 410 (2013); \nsee also Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499-500 (2009); Whitmore v. Arkansas, \n495 U.S. 149, 157-60 (1990).  Declarants discuss alleged risks to “sound policy decisions by state \nelected and appointed officials.”  Mot. Ex. 23, Barnett Decl. (ECF No. 14-25) ¶ 17; see also Mot. \nEx. 10, Ho Decl. (ECF No. 14-12) ¶ 20; Mot. Ex. 11, Johnson Decl. (ECF No. 14-13) ¶ 14; Mot. \nEx. 15, Dynarski Decl. (ECF No. 14-17) ¶ 16; Mot. Ex. 31, Tipton (ECF No. 14-33) ¶ 21.  Their \nspeculation about the members’ inability to provide research and information to the relevant \ncommunity “amounts to nothing more than speculation about future events that may or may not \noccur.”  Mahorner v. Bush, 224 F. Supp. 2d 48, 50 (D.D.C. 2002) (“The plaintiff’s allegation that \nhe will suffer an increased chance of losing his life if President Bush initiates a military conflict \nwith Iraq, amounts to nothing more than speculation about future events that may or may not \noccur.”), aff’d 2003 WL 349713 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Indigenous People of Biafra v. Blinken, 639 F. \nSupp.3d 79, 85 (D.D.C. 2022) (concluding the John Does who “reasonably fear[] injury at the \nhands of the Nigerian government”—after the United States’s sale of aircrafts to the Nigerian \ngovernment—failed to plead a sufficient injury-in-fact).  \nThus, without injury, Plaintiffs fail to demonstrate associational standing to bring this \naction and seek any relief. \n2.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Any Cancellation of the Institute’s \nContracts. \nInsofar as Plaintiffs seek reinstatement of any Institute contracts, the proper course would \nbe for the parties to those contracts to seek appropriate recourse under the terms of the contracts— \n- 12 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 23 of 50\nnot for Plaintiffs, as nonparties to the contracts, to seek such relief through this suit. Any challenges \nto the cancellation of the Institute’s contracts are not subject to this Court’s jurisdiction. Under the \nTucker Act, any claim based on “an express or implied contract with the United States” must be \nbrought in the Court of Federal Claims. 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). The Supreme Court recently \nreaffirmed this jurisdictional line in California: \nThe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not apply “if any \nother  statute  that  grants  consent  to  suit  expressly  or  impliedly \nforbids the relief which is sought.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. Nor does the \nwaiver apply to claims seeking “money damages.” Ibid. True, a \ndistrict court’s jurisdiction “is not barred by the possibility” that an \norder setting aside an agency’s action may result in the disbursement \nof funds. Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910, 108 S.Ct. \n2722, 101 L.Ed.2d 749 (1988). But, as we have recognized, the \nAPA’s limited waiver of immunity does not extend to orders “to \nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money” along the lines of \nwhat the District Court ordered here. Great-West Life & Annuity \nIns. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212, 122 S.Ct. 708, 151 L.Ed.2d \n635 (2002). Instead, the Tucker Act grants the Court of Federal \nClaims jurisdiction over suits based on “any express or implied \ncontract with the United States.”  28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1).  \n \nDep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, 967 (2025); see also U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops \nv. Dep’t of State, Civ. A. No. 25-465 (TNM), 2025 WL 763738, at *4 (D.D.C. Mar. 11, 2025) \n(explaining that the D.C. Circuit has long “interpreted the Tucker Act as providing the exclusive \nremedy for contract claims against the government” (cleaned up)), appeal docketed No. 25-5066 \n(D.C. Cir.).  Since California, courts have been reacting by withholding or staying orders that \nwould have required the types of remedies sought here.  See, e.g., Am. Ass’n of Colleges for \nTeacher Ed., et al. v. McMahon, No. 25-1281 (4th Cir. Apr. 10, 2025) (granting the Government’s \nmotion to stay a preliminary injunction because of California); Mass. Fair Housing Cent. et al v. \nHUD, Civ. A. No. 25-30041 (D. Mass Apr. 14, 2025) (dissolving temporary restraining order \nconsidering the Supreme Court’s decision in California). \n- 13 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 24 of 50\nTo determine whether an action is “at its essence a contract action,” this Court looks at \nboth “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and “the type of relief \nsought (or appropriate).”  Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (cleaned \nup).  In this case, both of those considerations make clear that this Court lacks jurisdiction over \nany claims challenging the cancellation of the Institute’s contracts, particularly as here, brought \nby entities lacking privity with contracting parties. \nPlaintiffs  improperly point to  the  Act  and  the  APA  as  sources  of  the  rights to  the \ncontinuation of the contracts cancelled by the Institute.  See Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 21, 22; \nCompl. ¶¶ (ECF No. 1) 101-35.  The Act permits the Institute to perform its delineated functions \n“directly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.”  20 U.S.C. § 9512 (emphasis \nadded).  To the extent that the Act requires any of the Institute’s centers to enter contracts to \nperform their duties, Plaintiffs provide no suggestion that the Act required the centers to maintain \nthe particular contracts being challenged.  Given that Plaintiffs seek the reinstatement of those \nspecific contracts that had been cancelled the source of Plaintiffs’ challenge then lies within those \nspecific contracts themselves.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 137.  Moreover, citation to the APA is \nirrelevant, as the APA itself will not grant jurisdiction where another statutory scheme, here the \nTucker Act, applies.  See Albrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Reserve Emp. Benefits Sys., \n357 F.3d 62, 67-68 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (“the Tucker Act impliedly forbids” the bringing of “contract \nactions” against “the government in a federal district court” under the APA (cleaned up)). \nIn any event, the latter Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968, factor is dispositive here.  The nature \nof the relief Plaintiffs seek sounds in contract.  See Conf. of Catholic Bishops, 2025 WL 763738, \nat *7-8.  It asks the Court to “to reinstate the canceled contracts.”  Compl. at (ECF No. 1) ¶ 137.  \nThus, Plaintiffs “seek[] the classic contractual remedy of specific performance.”   Spectrum \n- 14 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 25 of 50\nLeasing Corp. v. United States, 764 F.2d 891, 894 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  But this Court cannot order \nthe Government to continue to specifically perform a contract.  Id.  Such a request for an order that \nthe government “must perform” on its contract is one that “must be resolved by the Claims Court.”  \nIngersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1985); see also California, 145 S. \nCt. at 967 (the “Government is likely to succeed in showing the District Court lacked jurisdiction \nto order the payment of money under the APA,” and “as we have recognized, the APA’s limited \nwaiver  of  immunity  does  not  extend  to  orders  ‘to  enforce  a  contractual  obligation  to  pay \nmoney[.]’”) (cleaned up).  Indeed, this Court has already found that there was no jurisdiction to \nhear a claim by a federal grantee seeking specific performance on a federal grant agreement.  As \nto the D.C. Circuit precedent, Ingersoll-Rand Co., this Court has written: “[t]he Court squints in \nvain  to  see any daylight.   Like  those  plaintiffs, the [plaintiff]  asks the  Court  to order  the \nGovernment to cancel the termination, pay money due, and reinstate the contracts.  That is \nsomething this Court lacks the power to do.”  Conf. of Catholic Bishops, 2025 WL 763738, at *6.  \nThe same is true here. \nThe Court likewise lacks the power to grant Plaintiff’s request to require the Government \n“to re-bid the contracts” and “solicit[] new contracts”   Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 137.  Plaintiffs in \ntheir brief point to no authority that requires any party, let alone the Government, to contract.  \nMoreover, as explained further below, “the allocation of funds from a lumpsum appropriation is \nanother administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to agency discretion.”  Lincoln \nv. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993).  This is particularly clear here where Plaintiffs do not claim \nthat the Institute has to perform all of its duties through contracts, let alone through specific \ncontracts.  In short, the Court cannot require the Executive to enter into new contracts or direct \nfunds that Congress has specifically committed to Executive discretion. \n- 15 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 26 of 50\nIn  sum,  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  over  the  claims  challenging  the  Departments’ \ncancellation of the contracts. \n3.  The Court Lacks Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ Employment Action Claims. \nAlthough district courts have jurisdiction over civil actions arising under federal law, see \n28 U.S.C. § 1331, “Congress may preclude district court jurisdiction by establishing an alternative \nstatutory scheme for administrative and judicial review.”  Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. \nTrump (“AFGE”), 929 F.3d 748, 754 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  As detailed below, Congress has precluded \njurisdiction for the claims brought by Plaintiffs challenging the Department’s reductions in force. \nThe  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  (“CSRA”)  and  Federal  Service  Labor-Management \nRelations  Statute  (“FSL-MRS”),  which  is  set  forth  within  the  CSRA,  together  provide  a \ncomprehensive “scheme of administrative and judicial review” for resolving both disputes between \nemployees  and  their  federal  employers  and  disputes  brought  by  unions  representing  those \nemployees.  AFGE, 929 F.3d at 752 (regarding FSL-MRS); see also Graham v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d \n931, 933 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (regarding CSRA more broadly).  In these statutes, Congress provided \nthat most federal labor and employment disputes must first be administratively exhausted before \nthe employing agency and the applicable administrative review board—either the Merit Systems \nProtection Board for employment disputes, the Federal Labor Relations Authority for labor \ndisputes, or the Office of Special Counsel for certain “prohibited personnel practices.”  Judicial \nreview, if any, is generally available only following the exhaustion of administrative review.  See \nAFGE, 929 F.3d at 752 (citing 5 U.S.C. §§ 7105, 7123(a), (c)); United States v. Fausto, 484 U.S. \n439, 448–50 (1988)); see also 5 U.S.C. § 7703(b) (providing for judicial review in the Federal \nCircuit or other court of appeals). \n“Personnel actions” that fall within the Office of Special Counsel’s purview include “any. \n.  .  significant  change[s]  in  duties,  responsibilities,  or  working  conditions.”    5  U.S.C. \n- 16 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 27 of 50\n§ 2302(a)(2)(A)(xii).    The  CSRA  enumerates  thirteen  circumstances  under  which  personnel \nactions become “prohibited personnel practices,” which must be brought before the Office of \nSpecial Counsel in the first instance.  Id. § 2302(b).  One of those thirteen “prohibited personnel \npractices” occurs when a “personnel action” violates “any law, rule, or regulation implementing, \nor directly concerning, the merit system principles” listed in the statute.  Id. § 2302(b)(12).  These \nprinciples require, in relevant part, “proper regard for [employees’] constitutional rights.”  Id. \n§ 2301(b)(2).  Consequently, personnel actions that implicate violations of constitutional rights are \nprohibited personnel practices that generally fall within the CSRA’s exclusive remedial scheme.  \nSee, e.g., Weaver v. Info. Agency, 87 F.3d 1429, 1432 (D.C. Cir. 1996). \nIn AFGE, the D.C. Circuit applied the “two-step framework set forth in” Thunder Basin \nCoal Co. v. Reich, 510 U.S. 200 (1994) to conclude that the union plaintiffs in that case could not \nchallenge in district court three executive orders related to federal employment.  AFGE, 929 F.3d \nat 754.  Under that framework, district courts lack jurisdiction over suits like this one when the \nintent for exclusive review in the court of appeals is “(i) fairly discernible in the statutory scheme, \nand (ii) the litigant’s claims are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within [the] statutory \nstructure.”  See id. at 755 (citations omitted). \nThe Supreme Court repeatedly has held that the CSRA provides the exclusive means of \nredressing employment disputes involving federal employees.  See Elgin v. Dep’t of Treasury, 567 \nU.S. 1, 10–15 (2012); Fausto, 484 U.S. at 455.  Likewise, the D.C. Circuit repeatedly has \nrecognized that the FSL-MRS and the CSRA readily satisfy the first prong of the Thunder Basin \nframework.  See AFGE, 929 F.3d at 755 (concluding that union plaintiffs could not challenge in \ndistrict court three executive orders related to federal employment); Fornaro v. James, 416 F.3d \n63, 66 (D.C. Cir. 2005); but see Axon Enterprise, Inc. v. FTC, 598 U.S. 175 (2023).  In other \n- 17 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 28 of 50\nwords, Congress intended to make the FSL-MRS and CSRA the exclusive scheme, and they satisfy \nthe first step of the two-step Thunder Basin framework. \nAs to covered actions, beyond restricting judicial review of covered constitutional claims, \nthe CSRA prevents district courts from deciding the merits of APA claims challenging an agency’s \n“‘systemwide’. . . policy interpreting a statute,” its “implementation of such a policy in a particular \ncase,” Nyunt v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Govs., 589 F.3d 445, 449 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (quoting \nFornaro, 416 F.3d at 67–69), or its decision to engage in “‘a type of personnel action’ the [CSRA] \ndoes not cover,” Mahoney v. Donovan, 721 F.3d 633, 635–36 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (emphasis in \noriginal); see generally Grosdidier v. Chairman, Broad. Bd. of Govs., 560 F.3d 495, 497 (D.C. \nCir. 2009) (holding that federal employees “may not circumvent the [CSRA’s] requirements and \nlimitations by resorting to the catchall APA to challenge agency employment actions”).  As the \nD.C. Circuit put it bluntly: “what you get under the CSRA is what you get,” even if what you get \nis nothing at all.  Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67. \nWith respect to any constitutional claims, even in cases centering on CSRA–covered \nactions, the Supreme Court has considered the availability of “meaningful review” in an Article III \njudicial forum when evaluating the scope of the CSRA’s exclusive remedial scheme.  Elgin, 567 \nU.S. at 10.  The D.C. Circuit has similarly consistently determined that federal employees have “a \nright to federal court review of their constitutional claims.”  Weaver, 87 F.3d at 1433.  Although \nthere exists a narrow exception to the exhaustion rule for employees covered under the CSRA \nwhen their “constitutional claim raises issues totally unrelated to the CSRA procedures,” Steadman \nv. Gov., U.S. Soldiers & Airmen’s Home, 918 F.2d 963, 967 (D.C. Cir. 1990), this exception is a \nnarrow one, and does not excuse exhaustion requirement for claims, that, while framed as \nconstitutional challenges, are in truth a disguised “vehicle” to challenge CSRA–covered personnel \n- 18 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 29 of 50\nactions or practices.  Elgin, 567 U.S. at 22; Turner v. U.S. Agency for Global Media, 502 F. Supp. \n3d 333, 366 (D.D.C. 2020). \nHere,  Plaintiffs seek among  other things,  “to restore sufficient employee  positions.”  \nCompl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 139.  But allowing a stranger to the federal-employment relationship such \nas Plaintiffs to raise claims in this Court that the affected federal employees themselves cannot \nraise would upend the entire reticulated process Congress set out in the exclusive statutory schemes \nof the CSRA and other employment statutes.  The “exclusion” of Plaintiffs “from the provisions \nestablishing administrative and judicial review for personnel action” of the type challenged here \n“prevents [Plaintiffs] from seeking review” under other provisions.  Fausto, 484 U.S. at 455; see \nalso Grosdidier, 560 F.3d at 497 (“[T]he CSRA is the exclusive avenue for suit even if the plaintiff \ncannot prevail[.]”). \nWhen a comprehensive scheme of the sort at issue here permits review at the behest of \nsome types of plaintiffs but not others, it implicitly precludes review by plaintiffs who are not \nauthorized to bring claims. For example, Block v. Cmty. Nutrition Inst., 467 U.S. 340, 347 (1984) \nconsidered a statute that permitted dairy handlers to obtain review of certain “market orders” after \nexhausting administrative remedies, but did not authorize review by anyone else.  See id. at 346 \n(citing 7 U.S.C. § 608c).  When a group of dairy consumers sought review of a marketing order, \nthe Supreme Court explained that the statute omits a “provision for participation by consumers in \nany proceeding,” and that “[i]n a complex scheme of this type, the omission of such a provision is \nsufficient reason to believe that Congress intended to foreclose consumer participation in the \nregulatory process.”  Id. at 347.  Hence, the “structure of this Act indicates that Congress intended \nonly producers and handlers, and not consumers, to ensure that the statutory objectives would be \nrealized.”  Id.  And the “restriction of the administrative remedy to handlers strongly suggests that \n- 19 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 30 of 50\nCongress intended a similar restriction of judicial review of market orders.”  Id.  Any other holding \nwould facilitate circumvention of the comprehensive statutory scheme.  See id. at 348. \nThe principles described in Block fully apply to the CSRA and other employment statutory \nschemes.  See Fausto, 484 U.S. at 448 (applying Block to conclude that certain employees who \nlack CSRA appeal rights “should not be able to demand judicial review for the type of personnel \naction covered by that chapter”); see also Thunder Basin, 510 U.S. at 207 (citing Block for \ngoverning standards in determining if review is precluded).  Because Congress intentionally \nforeclosed judicial review by parties other than those whom it specifically authorized to seek relief, \nPlaintiffs, who are not employees of the Department, certainly cannot challenge the Department’s \nemployment actions either. \nFurthermore, even setting aside Plaintiffs’ lack of any role in the federal employment \nrelationship, Plaintiff still cannot bypass Congress’s statutory procedures by artfully labeling their \nclaims as a broad challenge to the March 11, 2025, announced reductions in force.  Pls.’ Br. (ECF \nNo. 14-1) at 20.  Even where challengers “frame their suit as a systemwide challenge to” agency \n“policy” rather than individual benefits determinations, the exclusive review procedures for federal \nemployees remain mandatory.  Fornaro, 416 F.3d at 67–68 (Roberts, J., for the Court); accord \nNyunt,  589  F.3d  at  448–49  (rule  that  federal  employees  may  not  use  APA  challenge  to \n“circumvent” CSRA process “applies to a ‘systemwide challenge’ to an agency policy interpreting \na statute just as it does to the implementation of such a policy in a particular case”) (Kavanaugh, \nJ., for the Court); see also Lacson v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 726 F.3d 170, 175 (D.C. Cir. 2013) \n(describing Elgin as having “echoed and amplified the approach taken” in D.C. Circuit cases such \nas Fornaro and Nyunt).  So should this Court accept Plaintiffs’ characterization of their suit, that \n- 20 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 31 of 50\nwould not allow them to “bypass” the FSL-MRS and CSRA.  See Am. Foreign Serv. Ass’n v. \nTrump, Civ. A. No. 25-352 (CJN), 2025 WL 573762, at *11 (D.D.C. Feb. 21, 2025). \nPlaintiffs’ challenges to the reductions in force also cannot be understood as collateral to \nthe statutory review provisions at issue.  “This consideration is related to whether meaningful \njudicial review is available,” but focuses on “whether the plaintiffs aim[] to seek the same relief \nthey could obtain in the agency proceeding.”  AFGE, 929 F.3d at 759–60 (quotation marks \nomitted).  Surely they do—based on the relief the Complaint seeks, Plaintiffs at this point seek to \n“restore sufficient employee positions.”  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶ 139.  Proceedings before the \nadministrative agencies could culminate in that relief.  See, e.g., Payne v. Biden, 62 F.4th 598, 607 \n(D.C. Cir. 2023), judgment vacated as moot, 144 S. Ct. 480 (2023) (MSPB can resolve “challenges \nto adverse employment actions”).  \nUltimately,  allowing  separate  litigation  by  the  instant  Plaintiffs  would  “seriously \nundermine[]” “[t]he CSRA’s objective of creating an integrated scheme of review,” Elgin, 567 \nU.S. at 14, and harm “the development . . . of a unitary and consistent Executive Branch position \non matters involving personnel action,” Fausto, 484 U.S. at 449.  Thus, the Court does not have \njurisdiction to review any of Plaintiffs’ claims challenging the Department’s reductions in force. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Fail on the Merits. \n1.  Plaintiffs’ APA Claims (Counts I-III) Fail. \n(a) Plaintiffs Have Not Identified A Discrete Agency Action. \nAs a threshold matter, Plaintiffs do not identify a discrete and circumscribed agency action \nthat the Department has taken and that could specifically be redressed by a federal court. Plaintiffs \nmust plead “an identifiable action or event” and “direct [their] attack against some particular \n‘agency action’ that causes [them] harm.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891, 899; see also S. Utah, 542 U.S. \nat 62 (APA limits judicial review to “circumscribed, discrete agency actions”).  These final agency \n- 21 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 32 of 50\nactions must be “circumscribed [and] discrete.”  S. Utah, 542 U.S. at 62.  The APA does not \nprovide for “general judicial review of [an agency’s] day-to-day operations,” Lujan, 497 U.S. at \n899, like “constructing a building, operating a program, or performing a contract,” Vill. of Bald \nHead Island v. U.S. Army Corps. of Eng’rs, 714 F.3d 186, 193 (4th Cir. 2013).  The APA thus \ncontains “a prohibition on programmatic challenges,” meaning “challenges that seek ‘wholesale \nimprovement’ of an agency’s programs by court decree.”  Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Tex. v. \nUnited States, 757 F.3d 484, 490 (5th Cir. 2014) (cleaned up).  “Because ‘an on-going program or \npolicy is not, in itself, a final agency action under the APA,’ [a court’s] jurisdiction does not extend \nto reviewing generalized complaints about agency behavior.”  Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d \n301, 307 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ claims and requested injunction present exactly the type of wholesale challenge \nthat the APA forbids.  Plaintiffs’ allegations reveal that they do not seek judicial review of a \ndiscrete  agency  action.    Rather,  they  seek  wholesale  judicial  review  of  the  Department’s \nmanagement of the Institute.  Instead of presenting the Court with a “narrow question to resolve,” \nCobell, 455 F.3d at 307, Plaintiffs challenge a host of individual actions—the cancellation of \nInstitute contracts, a reduction in Institute staff, and the end of the Institute’s remote access \nprogram, see, e.g., Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶¶ 4-6; Pls.’ Br. at 22-23 (“Defendants’ actions, namely, \nby  reducing  staff  .  .  .;  cancelling  contracts  necessary  for  the  maintenance,  analysis,  and \ndissemination of data; and restricting Plaintiffs’ and their members’ use of data, are arbitrary and \ncapricious . . . .”). \nAddressing this type of claim would require the Court to supervise all the agency’s \nactivities and determine how the agency would accomplish each statutorily-mandated function— \nan even more extreme kind of supervisory claim than was at issue and rejected in Lujan.  See 497 \n- 22 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 33 of 50\nU.S. at 892-93.  Such a claim would completely circumvent the purpose of the APA’s discrete \nagency action requirement, which is to “protect agencies from undue judicial interference with \ntheir lawful discretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which \ncourts lack both expertise and information to resolve.”  S. Utah, 542 U.S. at 66-67. \nAlthough Plaintiffs attempt to cloak this action as an “administrative” challenge or a \nConstitutional  challenge, at  bottom, their  challenge  is  to  the executive orders directing the \ntermination of contracts and reorganization of the Department.  Because an executive order is a \npresidential action, and not an agency action, Plaintiffs’ challenges to any executive order under \nthe APA are not reviewable.  See Louisiana v. Biden, 622 F. Supp. 3d 267, 288 (W.D. La. 2022) \n(holding that a challenge to EO 14008 “cannot be reviewed under the APA because the President \nis not an agency”).  Plaintiffs’ claims that the Contract Executive Order or Department Executive \nOrder was adopted without “hallmarks” of agency actions are all non-cognizable under the APA.  \nSee id.; Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 24. \n(b) Plaintiffs Do Not Identify Any Final Agency Action. \nEven assuming Plaintiffs have identified discrete agency actions, they have not shown that \nthese programmatic actions are final.  “Final agency action” has two components.  First, the action \nmust “mark the ‘consummation’ of the agency’s decisionmaking process[.]”  Bennett v. Spear, 520 \nU.S. 154, 178 (1997) (citation omitted).  It may not be a “preliminary, procedural, or intermediate \nagency action[.]”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  Second, the action must “be one by which ‘rights or obligations \nhave been determined,’ or from which ‘legal consequences will flow.’”  Bennett, 520 U.S. at 178 \n(citation omitted). \nPlaintiffs’ motion claims that the Department’s actions reflect a decision to terminate the \nInstitute is a final agency action.  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 20.  It is telling that Plaintiffs are \nunable to identify any concrete, final decision by the Department to shut down the Institute.  To \n- 23 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 34 of 50\nthe extent that Plaintiffs are relying on any of the individual actions taken with respect to the \nInstitute as the final agency action with respect to the reorganization of the Department, Secretary \nMcMahon in her public statements has indicated those programmatic decisions mark the initiation, \nnot the consummation, of the agency’s decision-making process regarding the reorganization of \nthe Department.   \nThe actions taken so far reflect a decision by Department leadership that agency functions \nneed to be streamlined and reorganized.  Those decisions are thus “preliminary” in nature and “not \ndirectly reviewable.”  See 5 U.S.C. § 704.  “It may be a step, which if erroneous will mature into \na prejudicial result[.]”  Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 112 (1948).  \nBut that does not make the individual programmatic actions themselves the “consummation of the \nadministrative process” reevaluating the agency’s priorities to reorganize the Department.  Id. at \n113. \n(c) There Are Adequate Alternative Remedies Available. \nReview under the APA is available only where “there is no other adequate remedy in a \ncourt.”  5 U.S.C. § 704.  The requirement that a plaintiff have “no other adequate remedy in court,” \nid., reflects that “Congress did not intend the general grant of review in the APA to duplicate \nexisting procedures for review of agency action,” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 903.  As the D.C. Circuit has \nobserved, “the alternative remedy need not provide relief identical to relief under the APA, so long \nas it offers relief of the ‘same genre.’”  Garcia v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 519, 522 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n(citation omitted).  If there exists an alternative adequate judicial remedy, a plaintiff lacks a cause \nof action under the APA.  See Perry Cap. LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 621 (D.C. Cir. 2017); \nsee also Versata Dev. Corp. v. Rea, 959 F. Supp. 2d 912, 927 (E.D. Va. 2013) (dismissing putative \nAPA claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (“Rule”) 12(b)(6) because decision at issue was \nnot a final agency action and an alternative adequate remedy existed by way of appeal to the \n- 24 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 35 of 50\nFederal Circuit).  As already described above, this is, in essence, an employment action, and there \nare CSRA and FSL-MRS remedies.  To the extent this case rests on contract claims, then the Court \nof Federal Claims provides an adequate alternative under the Tucker Act. \n(d) Because  the  Contract  Executive  Order  and  Department  Executive  Order \nExpressly Direct the Department to Continue All Actions Required by Law, the \nExecutive Orders Do Not Infringe on the Department’s Statutory Obligations. \nPlaintiffs  are  unlikely  to  succeed  on  the  substantive  merits  of  their  claim  that  the \nDepartment’s statutes foreclosed the actions that the Department has taken pursuant to the Contract \nExecutive Order or Department Executive Order.  Insofar as they are challenging the President’s \nexecutive orders, the claims fail because they rely on characterizations of those orders that are \ninconsistent with their terms.  The Contract Executive Order instructs for the termination of \ncontracts “where appropriate and consistent with applicable law.”  Exec. Order. No. 14,222 § 3(b), \n90 Fed. Reg. at 11,096.  Moreover, the Department Executive Order does not require the immediate \nshutdown of the Department.  To the contrary, the Department Executive Order requires the \nSecretary of Education only to discontinue activities “to the maximum extent appropriate and \npermitted by law.”  Exec. Order No. 14,242 § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,679.  \nDefinitionally, directing the Secretary to end contracts or functions consistent with law \ncannot be interpreted to violate the law.  It is plainly lawful for the President to direct the Secretary \nto act within the agency’s discretion to implement the Act and related statutes consistent with the \nlaw.  See, e.g., Sherley v. Sebelius, 689 F.3d 776, 784 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (“[A]s an agency under the \ndirection of the executive branch, it must implement the President’s policy directives to the extent \npermitted by law.”).  Plaintiffs argue that Defendants violate the Act by terminating contracts and \nreducing the Institute’s staff.  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 26.  But that argument proceeds from a \npremise that the Contract Executive Order and Department Executive Order expressly reject.  \nAgain, the notion that the agency has eliminated any of the Institute’s statutorily mandated \n- 25 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 36 of 50\nprograms is inconsistent with Secretary McMahon’s statement that the Department “will continue \nto deliver on all statutory programs that fall under the agency’s purview.”  RIF Press Release.  \nPlaintiffs point to no authority permitting them to act as the equivalent to a board of directors \noverseeing and vetoing managerial and operational actions entrusted to Agency discretion. \n(e) The Department’s Staffing and Other Programmatic Implementation \nDecisions Are Committed to Agency Discretion. \nPlaintiffs are likewise unlikely to succeed on the merits of their arbitrary and capricious \nclaim, which, as briefed, involves actions committed to agency discretion by law. “Judicial review \nunder [the arbitrary and capricious] standard is deferential, and a court may not substitute its own \npolicy judgment for that of the agency.”  FCC v. Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 \n(2021).    Rather,  the  Court  must  ensure  “that  the  agency  has  acted  within  a  zone  of \nreasonableness[.]”  Id.  “[T]he standard of review is highly deferential” in determining whether an \naction is arbitrary and capricious, Littlefield v. Dep’t of the Interior, 85 F.4th 635, 643 (1st Cir. \n2023), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 1117 (2024), and agency action regarding reallocation of resources \nand reorganizing of  enforcement priorities after a change in presidential  administrations, if \nreviewable at all, must be afforded highly deferential rational basis review, cf. Lincoln, 508 U.S. \nat 192 (noting that, absent a statutory directive to the contrary, an agency has unreviewable \n“capacity to adapt to changing circumstances and meet its statutory responsibilities in what it sees \nas the most effective or desirable way.”). \nAs described above, President Trump and Secretary McMahon have repeatedly articulated \nthe presence of inefficiency and waste at the Department.  This waste impacted the ability of the \nDepartment to perform its underlying mission, which is to support the States and localities in \nproviding education to their citizens.  Based on these findings, the Secretary has taken the first \n- 26 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 37 of 50\nsteps  in  right-sizing  the  Department  through  a  reduction  in  force  and  other  programmatic \ndecisions, such as the end of the remote access program. \nPlaintiffs bear the burden of showing that these actions are arbitrary and capricious.  City \nof Olmsted Falls v. Fed. Aviation Admin., 292 F.3d 261, 271 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (quotations omitted).  \nThey come nowhere close to meeting their burden.  Their arguments contesting whether the \nreductions in force, the contract cancelations, or ending the remote access program will bring \nsavings, efficiency, or its policy objectives reflects a fundamental “lack of understanding” of “the \nnature” of the Department’s actions, see Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, \nInc., 435 U.S. 519, 553 (1978).  Plaintiffs have not pointed to any Department decision to terminate \nthe Institute.  Indeed, Plaintiff states that employees still remain at the Institute, Pls.’ Br (ECF \nNo. 14-1) at 2, and Plaintiffs do not claim that all of the Institute’s contracts have been terminated. \nMoreover,  the  Department  has  stated  its  commitment  to  performing  its  statutory \nobligations.  Ultimately, courts lack the power to “dictat[e] to the agency the methods[] [and] \nprocedures” it uses to complete its statutory obligations.  See Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 545 (quoting \nFed. Power Comm’n v. Transcon. Gas Pipe Line Corp., 423 U.S. 326, 333 (1976)).  To override \nthese principles and enjoin agency leadership from exercising control over their own staffing \nwould be an extraordinary violation of the separation of powers. \nIndeed, the reduction in force and end of the remote access program incorporate the type \nof actions that are “committed to agency discretion by law.”  5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2); Markland v. \nOPM, 140 F.3d 1031, 1033 (Fed. Cir. 1998) (“We accord an agency wide discretion in conducting \na reduction in force; absent a clear abuse of that discretion, a substantial departure from applicable \nprocedures, a misconstruction of governing statutes, or the like, we do not upset a final agency \ndecision.”) (cleaned up).  “In determining whether a matter has been committed solely to agency \n- 27 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 38 of 50\ndiscretion, [courts] consider both the nature of the administrative action at issue and the language \nand structure of the statute that supplies the applicable legal standards for reviewing that action.”   \nDrake v. FAA, 291 F.3d 59, 70 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Here, each factor shows that Defendants’ \nmanagerial decisions are committed to agency discretion. \nFirst, staffing decisions and other decisions on how to implement a program (such as the \nend of the remote access program) fit neatly among those “categories of administrative decisions \nthat courts traditionally have regarded as ‘committed to agency discretion.’”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. \nat 191-92 (citation omitted).  After all, the point of the Department’s actions is to improve \nefficiency, which allows the Department to “meet its statutory responsibilities in what [the new \nadministration] sees as the most effective or desirable way.”  Id. at 192.  Similarly, “an agency’s \ndecision not to prosecute or enforce, whether through civil or criminal process, is a decision \ngenerally committed to an agency’s absolute discretion.”  Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 831 \n(1985).  The reduction in force and other decisions on program implementation (such as the end \nof the access of the remote access program) reflect the Administration’s effort to realign the \nDepartment to provide better service to the American people.  “The agency is far better equipped \nthan the courts to deal with the many variables involved in the proper ordering of its priorities.”  \nId. at 831-32. \nSecond,  Plaintiffs  cannot  point  to  a  particular  statute  limiting the  agency’s  inherent \ndiscretion to reduce headcount or any requirement to have the exact remote access program that \nwas previously in place.  Again, agencies generally have broad discretion to determine how to \nimplement a statute.  See Vt. Yankee, 435 U.S. at 543. \nBut  even  if  this  Court  were  to  conclude  that  the  Department’s  explanation  for  the \nreductions in force or the end of the remote access program is insufficient to withstand judicial \n- 28 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 39 of 50\nreview, that would in no way justify a preliminary injunction.  Rather, “the proper course” would \nbe “to remand to the [Department] for additional . . . explanation,” not any type of injunction.  Fla. \nPower & Light Co. v. Lorion, 470 U.S. 729, 744 (1985). \n(f) The Department’s Funding Decisions Are Committed to the Agency’s \nDiscretion by Law. \nAdditionally, Plaintiffs’ challenge to funding decisions by the Department are committed \nto the agency’s discretion by law.  See 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  In appropriating funds for the \nInstitute, Congress gave the agency broad discretion to decide when and how to spend funds \nconsistent with the various purposes specified in the appropriations laws.  Here, in 2024, Congress \nappropriated funds “[f]or necessary expenses for the Institute of Education Sciences.”  Further \nConsolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. Law 118-47, 138 Stat. 690 (Mar. 23, 2024); S. Rept. \n118-84 at 247 (incorporated into statute by Pub. Law 118-47 § 4 and Explanatory Statement, 170 \nCong. Rec. H1501, 1886 (Mar. 22, 2024).  Congress continued funding at this level for 2025.  Sec. \n1101(a)(8), Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. Law 119-4 (Mar. \n15, 2025). \nThose appropriations provide no standards “against which to judge the agency’s exercise \nof discretion” in making the many choices the agency must make concerning how to spend those \nfunds.  See Heckler, 470 U.S. at 830.  The agency has unreviewable discretion to make choices on \nhow the appropriations are spent.  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192 (“the allocation of funds from a \nlumpsum appropriation is another administrative decision traditionally regarded as committed to \nagency discretion.”).  The Department’s decisions about how best to spend appropriated funds \n“requires  ‘a  complicated  balancing  of  a  number  of  factors  which  are  peculiarly  within  its \nexpertise,”’ and the “agency is far better equipped than the courts to deal with the many variables \ninvolved in the proper ordering of its priorities.”  Id. at 193 (quoting Heckler, 470 U.S. at 831–32). \n- 29 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 40 of 50\nMilk Train, Inc. v. Veneman, 310 F.3d 747 (D.C. Cir. 2002), supports the Government’s \nposition regarding the Executive’s discretion over appropriated funds.  There, the D.C. Circuit \nconsidered a challenge to the Secretary of Agriculture’s implementation of a subsidy program for \nmilk producers, where the agency received an appropriation “to provide assistance directly to . . . \ndairy producers, in a manner determined appropriate by the Secretary” “to compensate dairy \nproducers for economic losses incurred during 1999.”  Id. at 750, 751.  Plaintiffs challenged the \nagency’s method for calculating how much money a milk producer should receive, but the court \nheld that the statutory appropriations language “left to the Secretary the decision about how the \nmoneys for 1999 economic losses could best be distributed,” and that decision was unreviewable.  \nId. at 751–52.  The court also ruled that plaintiffs could challenge the Secretary’s calculation \ninsofar as it compensated dairy producers for the wrong year.  But that was because Congress had \nspecified that compensation must be for “economic losses incurred during 1999.”  Id. at 752.  In \nthat limited regard, “Congress limited the Secretary’s authority to disburse funds.”  Id. \nNo similar limitation exists here: Congress merely appropriated funds for broad purposes, \nincluding for the expenses of Institute operations, and the further delineation of broad purposes \ndoes not require that the Government provide specific amount funds to particular contracts or \nemployee salaries.  See Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024, Pub. Law 118-47, 138 \nStat. 690 (Mar. 23, 2024) (appropriating funds “[f]or necessary expenses for the Institute of \nEducation Sciences”); S. Rept. 118-84 at 247 (incorporated into statute by Pub. Law 118-47 § 4 \nand Explanatory Statement, 170 Cong. Rec. H1501, 1886 (Mar. 22, 2024); Sec. 1101(a)(8), Full-\nYear Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, Pub. Law 119-4 (Mar. 15, 2025).  How \nthose funds “could best be distributed” is not, as in Milk Train, a judicially reviewable question, \nbut instead is left to agency discretion. \n- 30 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 41 of 50\n2.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely to Succeed On their Constitutional Claims (Count \nIV).  \nPlaintiffs’ separation of powers claim is barred at the outset because it is purely statutory.  \nThe Supreme Court has made clear that “claims simply alleging that the President has exceeded \nhis statutory authority are not ‘constitutional’ claims, subject to judicial review[.]”  Dalton v. \nSpecter, 511 U.S. 462, 473 (1994).  This keeps with the long tradition of “distinguish[ing] between \nclaims of constitutional violations and claims that an official has acted in excess of his statutory \nauthority.”  Id. at 472.  The Constitution is implicated only if executive officers rely on it as “[t]he \nonly basis of authority” or if the executive officers rely on an unconstitutional statute.  Id. at 473, \nn.5.    Neither  of  those  situations  applies  here.    Thus,  Plaintiffs  cannot  bring  independent \nconstitutional claim.  See, e.g., Ctr. for Biological Diversity v. Trump, 453 F. Supp. 3d 11, 51–54 \n(D.D.C. 2020) (dismissing constitutional claims challenging border wall construction based on \nDalton). \nContending that the challenged actions violate the separation of powers, Plaintiffs are \nadvancing the similar arguments the Supreme Court rejected in  Dalton.  Plaintiffs’ alleged \nseparation-of-powers  claims  hinge  entirely  on,  respectively,  whether  Defendants  acted  in \naccordance with statutory obligations.  See Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶¶ 125-31; Pls.’ Br. (ECF \nNo. 14-1) at 26-29.  The outcome of the issues Plaintiffs raise depends on resolution of statutory \nclaims rather than any unique separation-of-powers principles.  If Plaintiffs’ argument were \naccepted, then every garden-variety action by a federal agency alleged to be in violation of a \nstatutory provision could also for the same reason be alleged to violate the constitutional separation \nof powers.  “Under Dalton, [Plaintiffs] cannot recast these types of claims as constitutional.”  Ctr. \nfor Biological Diversity, 453 F. Supp. 3d at 53; see also Dalton, 511 U.S. at 474 (stating that the \n“distinction between claims that an official exceeded his statutory authority, on the one hand, and \n- 31 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 42 of 50\nclaims that he acted in violation of the Constitution, on the other, is too well established to permit \nthis sort of evisceration.”).  Thus, Plaintiffs’ ultra vires claim fails.  Plaintiffs also assert in their \nmotion that “Defendants have violated their constitutional duty under the Take Care Clause[.]”  \nPls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 27.  Plaintiffs cannot obtain a preliminary injunction based on a claim \nthey have not asserted in the complaint.  Benoit v. Dist. of Columbia, Civ. A. No. 18-1104 (RC), \n2018 WL 5281908, *5 (D.D.C. Oct. 24, 2018); see also New York Times Co., v. Def. Health \nAgency, Civ. A. No. 21-0566 (BAH), 2021 WL 1614817, at *4 n.6 (D.D.C. Apr. 25, 2021) \n(collecting cases).  Plaintiffs here have not alleged in their Complaint a violation of the Take Care \nClause; their sole constitutional claim is a separations-of-power claim.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) \n¶¶ 125-31.  Plaintiffs as a result are unlikely to succeed on the merits of such claim, and the Court \ncannot grant a preliminary injunction based on that non-pleaded claim. \nNonetheless, the Take Care Clause does not provide a basis to review the actions of \nsubordinate Executive Branch officials.  The Clause speaks only to the President, not to his \nsubordinates, and ensures that the President is principally responsible for the actions of the \nExecutive Branch and directly accountable to the people through the political process.  See Free \nEnter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 492–93 (2010) (“It is his responsibility \nto take care that the laws be faithfully executed.”); id. at 495–97; see also Printz v. United States, \n521 U.S. 898, 922 (1997); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689–90 (1988); Clinton v. Jones, 520 \nU.S. 681, 712–13 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring).  A subordinate Executive officer cannot violate \nthe President’s duty to faithfully execute the laws.  To the extent Plaintiffs seek to challenge the \nactions of the Secretary, they cannot do so through the Take Care Clause, but must do so, if at all, \nthrough the APA, which as explained above, presents separate insurmountable obstacles for \nPlaintiffs. \n- 32 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 43 of 50\n3.  Plaintiffs Are Unlikely To Succeed On Their Ultra Vires Claim (Count V). \nPlaintiffs also repackage their APA claims as an ultra vires claim; but that claim will also \nlikely fail.  “[S]uits for specific relief against officers of the sovereign” allegedly acting “beyond \nstatutory authority or unconstitutionally” are not barred by sovereign immunity.   Larson v. \nDomestic & Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689, 693 (1949).  The exception to sovereign \nimmunity is based on the principle that such ultra vires action by a federal officer “is beyond the \nofficer’s powers and is, therefore, not the conduct of the sovereign.”  Id. at 690.  Here, Plaintiffs \nset forth no ultra vires claim that is distinct from their APA claims.  Compl. (ECF No. 1) ¶¶ 132-35.  \nCount V of the Complaint alleges that Defendants acted ultra vires “[b]y ignoring its clear \nobligations under  [the Act] and disrupting [the Institute’s]  and its Centers’ data collection, \nmaintenance, and dissemination activities.”  Id. ¶ 135.  This count is merely duplicative of the \nAPA claims in Counts I and III, which allege violations of statutory requirements under the Act.  \nId. ¶¶ 101-08, 119-24.  Thus, Plaintiffs’ ultra vires claim fails for the same reasons as do the APA \nclaims. \nII.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Shown  that  They  Will  Face  Irreparable  Harm  Absent  a \nPreliminary Injunction. \nThe D.C. Circuit “has set a high standard for irreparable injury.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches  v.  England,  454  F.3d  290,  297  (D.C.  Cir.  2006).    First,  the  moving party  must \ndemonstrate an injury that is “‘both certain and great’” and “of such imminence that there is a \n‘clear and present’ need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.”  Id. (emphasis in original) \n(quoting Wis. Gas Co. v. Fed. Regul. Comm’n, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  Second, the \ninjury must “be beyond remediation,” meaning the possibility of corrective relief “at a later date . \n. . weighs heavily against a claim of irreparable harm.”  Id. at 297–98 (quoting Wis. Gas, 758 F.2d \nat 674).  Plaintiffs’ various attempts to identify such an injury fail. \n- 33 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 44 of 50\nFirst, Plaintiffs point to the fact that they and their members are unable “to continue their \nresearch that relies on access to the Department’s databases.”  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 29.  But \n“[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily expended \nin the absence of a” preliminary injunction, such as locating alternative sources of information \nalternative, methods of accessing the Institute’s data, or different research projects, “are not \nenough” to show irreparable harm.  Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass’n v. Fed. Power Comm’n, 259 F.2d \n921,  925  (D.C.  Cir.  1958).    Moreover,  Plaintiffs  fail  to  show  that  this  injury  is  “beyond \nremediation” at the preliminary injunction phase.  Mexichem Specialty Resins, Inc. v. EPA, 787 \nF.3d 544, 555 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  In the Freedom of Information Act context, a plaintiff’s ability \n“to obtain all responsive and non-exempt documents at the conclusion of the litigation” makes it \n“difficult for a plaintiff to demonstrate ‘irreparable harm’ that is in fact ‘beyond remediation.’”  \nSai v. Transp. Sec. Admin., 54 F. Supp. 3d 5, 10 (D.D.C. 2014).  Likewise, if Plaintiffs prevail at \na later stage of this litigation, the Court could order restoration of the Institute’s research and \ninformation, which will ameliorate the harm.  See Pub. Citizen Health Rsch. Grp. v. Acosta, 363 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 22–23 (D.D.C. 2018). \nThe irreparable harm from the lack of data is indeed diminished here by the length of time \nsince Plaintiffs and their members learned of the contract cancellations or other issues with \nretrieving Institute data. “An unexcused delay in seeking extraordinary injunctive relief may be \ngrounds for denial because such delay implies a lack of urgency and irreparable harm.”  Newdow \nv. Bush, 355 F. Supp. 2d 265, 292 (D.D.C. 2005).  “The D.C. Circuit has found that a delay of \nforty-four days before bringing action for injunctive relief was ‘inexcusable,’ and ‘bolstered’ the \n‘conclusion that an injunction should not issue,’ particularly where the party seeking an injunction \nhad knowledge of the pending nature of the alleged irreparable harm.”  Open Top Sightseeing USA \n- 34 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 45 of 50\nv. Mr. Sightseeing, LCC, 48 F. Supp. 3d 87, 90 (D.D.C. 2014) (quoting Fund for Animals v. \nFrizzell, 530 F.2d 982, 987 (D.C. Cir. 1975)); see also Mylan Pharms., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F. Supp. \n2d 30, 44 (D.D.C. 2000) (delay of two months in bringing action “militates against a finding of \nirreparable harm”); Biovail Corp. v. FDA, 448 F. Supp. 2d 154, 165 (D.D.C. 2006) (“The delay in \nfiling this suit further undermines any showing of irreparable injury”). \nPlaintiffs claim that the many of the Institute’s contracts were terminated as early as \nFebruary 10, 2025, that their members were notified on February 10, 2025, and that their restricted \nuse licenses for the remote access program would be terminated.  See Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) \nat 7, 20.  The fact that Plaintiffs then have waited nearly than three months to seek injunctive relief \ncalls into doubt their claims that they and their members are suffering irreparable harm from the \nInstitute’s status. \nPlaintiffs also cannot demonstrate irreparable harm by pointing to “[l]ack of timely access \nto information.”  Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) at 29.  Plaintiffs point to no requirement that the Institute \nprovide the data or research on a particular timeline. And while “in general, data is more valuable \nthe more timely it is, [] plaintiffs seeking access to information are not by default entitled to \npreliminary injunctive relief.”  Pub. Citizen, 363 F. Supp. 3d at 22–23.  Moreover, Plaintiffs only \nspeculate that the quality of data will erode without having the same number of staffing and the \nsame exact contracts that were in place prior to February 2025.  See, e.g., Pls.’ Br. (ECF No. 14-1) \nat 30; Ex. 10, Ho Decl. (ECF No. 14-12) ¶ 17 (“With such a significant reduction in staff across \n[the Institute], I do not believe that it is possible to ensure that data I need such as NAEP and \nEDFacts are valid and reliable and meet high methodological standards as statute requires.”); \nEx. 12, Briggs Decl. (ECF No. 14-14) ¶ 16 (“I do not believe that NAEP data can continue to be \ncollected to the highest methodological standards as required by law if there are hardly any staff \n- 35 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 46 of 50\nor contractors available to perform this work”); Ex. 14, Reardon Decl. (ECF No. 14-16) ¶ 29 (“I \ndo not believe that this data can continue to be collected to the highest methodological standards \nas required by law if there are few staff or contractors available to perform this work.”); Ex. 13, \nPatts Decl. (ECF No. 14-15) ¶ 20 (pointing to “experience”); Ex. 16, McCarty Decl. (ECF \nNo. 14-18) 15; Ex. 23, Barnett Decl. (ECF No. 14-25) ¶ 12.  Such “speculation” based on nothing \nother than the declarants’ beliefs or experience does not satisfy Plaintiffs’ burden for making a \n“credible showing of a likelihood of irreparable harm.”  Pub. Citizen, 363 F. Supp. 3d at 23. \nSecond, Plaintiffs point to the harm to the purported data or research should the Institute’s \nstaffing and contracts not be reinstated as they were prior to February 2025.  See Pls.’ Br. (ECF \nNo. 14-1) at 31-33.  But that assertion is misplaced because “harm that might befall unnamed third \nparties does not satisfy the irreparable harm requirement in the context of emergency injunctive \nrelief, which must instead be connected specifically to the parties before the Court.”  State v. Musk. \n--- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2025 WL 520583, at *4 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (quoting Church v. Biden, \n573 F. Supp. 3d 118, 146 (D.D.C. 2021)); see also Kansas v. United States, 124 F.4th 529, 534 \n(8th Cir. 2024) (“The irreparable-harm analysis focuses on the moving party, not the nonmoving \nparty or some third party.”) (citation omitted).  By focusing on the any purported damage to the \ndata or research, Plaintiffs here essentially point to the harm that non-parties, those in the \ncommunity  who  rely  on  their  research  and  publications,  would  suffer  from  the  purported \ndiminished quality in the research that Plaintiffs and their members produce or publish.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs fail to demonstrate irreparable harm. \nIII.  The Equities and Public Interest Weigh Against Relief. \nThe third and fourth requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction—the balance of \nharms and whether the requested injunction will disserve the public interest—“merge when the \nGovernment is the opposing party.”  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  These factors tilt decisively against \n- 36 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 47 of 50\ngranting a preliminary injunction here.  See Kim v. FINRA, 698 F. Supp. 3d 147, 172 (D.D.C. \n2023) (“[A] court can deny preliminary injunctive relief solely on the balance of equities and \npublic interest factors even in cases, like this, involving constitutional claims.”), appeal dismissed, \nNo. 23-7136, 2025 WL 313965 (D.C. Cir. Jan. 27, 2025).  Granting a preliminary injunction would \ndisrupt the Department’s efforts to perform the overhaul of the Department as the Secretary \nenvisioned or comply with the Contract Executive Order to “terminate . . . such covered contracts \n. . . to reduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to promote efficiency and advance \nthe policies of [the] Administration,” Exec. Order. No. 14,222 § 3(b), 90 Fed. Reg. at 11,096, as \nwell as the Department Executive Order’s directive to “the maximum extent appropriate and \npermitted by law, take all necessary steps to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education \nand return authority over education to the States and local communities while ensuring the \neffective and uninterrupted delivery of services, programs, and benefits on which Americans rely,” \nExec. Order No. 14,242 § 2(a), 90 Fed. Reg. at 13,679. \nThe public has an interest in permitting the President to take decisive action when it comes \nto setting his policy priorities for the Institute.  Entering any sort of preliminary relief would \ndisplace and frustrate the President’s decision about how to best address those issues.  Heckler, \n470 U.S. at 831–32.  As discussed above, Plaintiffs will not suffer any irreparable harm from the \ndenial of their request for preliminary relief, because Plaintiffs have not shown that their harm \ncould not otherwise be mediated later, or they have asserted harms on behalf of parties not before \nthis Court. \nIV.  Any Preliminary Injunction Should Be Limited. \nFor the reasons explained above, Plaintiffs are not entitled to a preliminary injunction.  But \nif the Court concludes otherwise, the relief granted “must be narrowly tailored to remedy the \nspecific harm shown,” Neb. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs. v. U.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., \n- 37 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 48 of 50\n435 F.3d 326, 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted), and “should be no more burdensome to the \ndefendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs,” Madsen v. Women’s Health \nCtr., Inc., 512 U.S. 753, 765 (1994) (citation omitted).  The expansive relief that Plaintiffs seek \nflouts these well-established principles and should be significantly narrowed, if awarded at all.  \nAs such, any preliminary injunction should do no more than necessary to alleviate the \nirreparable harm to any specific Plaintiff that the Court finds to have established such harm.  \nExtending relief that is either broader in substance or scope (i.e., wholesale reinstatement of \nstaffing at or any contracts for programs that Plaintiffs do not even utilize) would violate the \nfoundational Article III principle that judicial remedies “must be tailored to redress the plaintiff’s \nparticular injury.”  Gill v. Whitford, 585 U.S. 48, 73 (2018).  A federal court may entertain a suit \nonly by a plaintiff who has suffered a concrete “injury in fact,” and the court may grant relief only \nto remedy “the inadequacy that produced [the plaintiff’s] injury.”  Id. at 66 (citation omitted).  \nPrinciples of equity reinforce those limitations, and “[u]niversal injunctions have little basis in \ntraditional equitable practice.”  Dep’t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 (2020) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring). \nV.  Any Preliminary Injunction Should Be Accompanied by Security and Stayed. \nAny preliminary injunction should also require Plaintiffs to post security.  Under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(c), the Court may issue a preliminary injunction “only if the movant \ngives security” for “costs and damages sustained” by Defendants if they are later found to “have \nbeen wrongfully enjoined.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(c).  In the event the Court issues an injunction here, \nthe Court should require Plaintiffs to post an appropriate bond commensurate with the scope of \nany injunction.  See DSE, Inc. v. United States, 169 F.3d 21, 33 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (stating that Rule \n65(c) places “broad discretion in the district court to determine the appropriate amount of an \ninjunction  bond”).    Particularly  given  that  the  relief  requested  by  Plaintiffs  could  hinder \n- 38 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 21     Filed 05/09/25     Page 49 of 50\nDefendants’ ability to conduct the reorganization of the Department in a manner consistent with \nthe President’s policies, the Court should consider the implications of any order prohibiting the \nPresident from implementing his policy objectives. \nFinally, to the extent the Court issues any injunctive relief, Defendants respectfully request \nthat such relief be stayed pending any appeal that is authorized by the Solicitor General, or at a \nminimum that such relief be administratively stayed for a period of seven days to allow the United \nStates to seek an emergency, expedited stay from the court of appeals if an appeal is authorized. \nCONCLUSION \n  For these reasons, Defendants respectfully request that the Court deny Plaintiffs’ motion \nfor preliminary injunction. \nDated: May 9, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n   \nEDWARD R.

Civil Action No. 25-1266 (TNM) \n \nDEPARTMENT OF EDUCTION, et al., \n \n    Defendants. \n \nDEFENDANTS’ MOTION TO STAY PROCEEDINGS \n  Defendants Department of Education and Linda McMahon, in her official capacity as \nEducation Secretary (collectively, the “Department”), respectfully move to stay all proceedings \npending the hearing and determination of the plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction in \nAssociation for Education Finance and Policy, Inc. v. McMahon, Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) \n(D.D.C. Apr. 17, 2025).  The preliminary injunctions in both cases seek identical relief and staying \nthe  proceedings  in  this  later-filed  case  when  briefing  on  plaintiffs’  motion  for  preliminary \ninjunction in Civ. A. No. 25-999 is complete and set for a hearing on May 9, 2025, ensures “the \njust, speedy, and inexpensive determination” of Plaintiffs’ claims here.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.  Pursuant \nto Local Civil Rule 7(m), the parties conferred, through counsel, and Plaintiffs indicate that they \noppose Defendants’ request.  \n“District courts have the discretion to stay or dismiss a pending suit when parallel litigation \nthat is factually related is ongoing in another forum.”  Holland v. ACL Transp. Servs., LLC, \n815 F. Supp. 2d 46, 55 (D.D.C. 2011)  (citing Handy v. Shaw, Bransford, Veilleux & Roth, \n325 F.3d 346, 349 (D.C. Cir. 2003)).  It is generally understood that separate parallel proceedings \nare a judicial inconvenience and that courts should “avoid duplicative litigation.”  Colo. River \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 16     Filed 05/05/25     Page 2 of 5\nWater Conservation Dist. v. United States, 424 U.S. 800, 817 (1976); see also Columbia Plaza \nCorp. v. Sec. Nat. Bank, 525 F.2d 620, 626 (D.C. Cir. 1975) (“Sound judicial administration \ncounsels  against  separate  proceedings,  and  the  wasteful  expenditure  of  energy  and  money \nincidental to separate litigation of identical issues should be avoided.”). \nIn order to determine if a stay is appropriate, the Court should consider the circumstances \nin this case, “weigh[ing] competing interests and maintain[ing] an even balance.”  See Wrenn v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 179 F. Supp. 3d 135, 137 (D.D.C. 2016); see, e.g., Landis v. North Am. \nCo., 299 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1936) (“[T]he powers to stay proceedings is incidental to the power \ninherent in every court to control the disposition of the causes on its docket with economy of time \nand effort for itself, for counsel, and for litigants.  How this can best be done calls for the exercise \nof judgment, which must weigh competing interests and maintain an even balance.”).  “A trial \ncourt may, with propriety, find it is efficient for its own docket and the fairest course for the parties \nto enter a stay of an action before it, pending resolution of independent proceedings which bear \nupon the case.”  See Hisler v. Gallaudet Univ., 344 F. Supp. 2d 29, 35 (D.D.C. 2004) (quoting \nLeyva v. Certified Grocers of California, Ltd., 593 F.2d 857, 863–64 (9th Cir. 1979)).  Because if \na sister court has examined its power to adjudicate a case and entered judgment that binds the \nparties, “the interests of comity mandate respect for the holding of [that] sister court when a de \nnovo review has the potential effect of subjecting one party to conflicting orders from two courts \nof  comparable  jurisdiction  and  authority.”   See Common  Cause  v.  Judicial  Ethics  Comm., \n473 F. Supp. 1251, 1253–54 (D.D.C. 1979).  “To do otherwise, would be tantamount to having \n[one trial court, for example,] sit as an appellate court, reviewing the decision of another trial \ncourt.”  See id. at 1254.  So, indeed, a party requesting a stay of proceedings “must make out a \n- 2 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 16     Filed 05/05/25     Page 3 of 5\nclear case of hardship or inequity in being required to go forward, if there is even a fair possibility \nthat the stay for which he prays will work damage to someone else.”  Landis, 299 U.S. at 255.  \nHere, at the outset, Plaintiffs concede that this matter and Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) \ninvolve common issues of fact and grow out of the same event or transaction.  Notice of Related \nCases (ECF No. 1-4).   Indeed, in this matter and Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM), the plaintiffs have \nmoved for preliminary injunctions that seek the same relief.  Plaintiffs in Civ. A. No. 25-999 \n(TNM) broadly ask the Court for an injunction requiring the Department to restore a program run \nby the Institute for Education Services, including reinstatement of employees and contracts, access, \nand  preservation  of  data.      Proposed  Order,  Ass’n  for  Ed.  Fin.  &  Policy  v.  McMahon, \nCiv. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) (D.D.C. Apr. 17, 2025).  Plaintiffs here similarly seek the restoration \nof that same program, including reinstatement of employees and contracts, access, and data.  \nProposed Order (ECF No. 14-34). \nCritically, Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) commenced first, briefing on the plaintiffs’ motion \nfor preliminary injunction in that case is now complete, and the Court has scheduled a hearing on \nthat motion for May 9, 2025.  Min. Order, Ass’n for Ed. Fin. & Policy v. McMahon, Civ. A. No. \n25-999 (TNM) (D.D.C. Apr. 18, 2025).  Because both matters involve substantially the same \nrequested relief and the same defendants, this Court’s decision in Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) will \nimpact, influence, and/or determine the outcome of Plaintiffs’ claims in this matter.  Staying this \nmatter pending this Court’s resolution of the preliminary injunction motion in Civ. A. No. 25-999 \n(TNM), therefore, advances judicial economy and efficiency, and preserves the parties’ resources.  \nTo the extent there are issues remaining in this instant matter as it relates to the preliminary \ninjunction, those narrower issues can be resolved after the Court adjudicates the preliminary \ninjunction motion in Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM).   \n- 3 - \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01266-TNM     Document 16     Filed 05/05/25     Page 4 of 5\nAccordingly, because Civ. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) commenced first, both matters involve \nthe same defendants and substantially similar requested relief, and to avoid the need for the parties \nand the Court to spend any time and resources addressing the same potential issues, the Department \nrespectively requests that the Court the stay this matter until the preliminary injunction motion in \nCiv. A. No. 25-999 (TNM) is resolved.  A proposed order is attached. \nDated: May 5, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n  Washington, DC   \nEDWARD R. MARTIN, JR., D.C.

This upheaval is understandably jarring for those who rely \non studies and data produced by the Institute.  Education advocacy groups that use the Institute’s \ndata filed two suits under the Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”).  They want a preliminary \ninjunction to stop the sudden changes and restore things to how they used to be. \n  But the APA was never meant to be a bureaucratic windbreak insulating agencies from \npolitical gales.  It cannot comprehensively undo multifaceted agency transformations wrought by \npolitical decisions.  APA challenges must focus on specific agency actions and seek equally \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 2 of 27\ntargeted remedies.  But the challenges here bundle together broad lists of grievances and seek \nwholesale modifications to agency operations writ large.  It is not this Court’s place to breathe \nlife back into wide swathes of the Institute’s cancelled programs and then monitor the agency’s \nday-to-day statutory compliance; essentially what Plaintiffs seek.  Such widespread modification \nto agency operations must come instead from “the offices of the Department or the halls of \nCongress, where programmatic improvements are normally made.”  Lujan v.

See \n \n1  The Court collectively refers to Plaintiffs in the first case as “the Association” and Plaintiffs in \nthe second case as “the Academy.”  The Court also uses the abbreviations “Assoc.” (Case No. \n25-cv-999) and “Acad.” (Case No. 25-cv-1266) in record citations to distinguish between the \ntwo sets of filings.  Citations are to CM/ECF pagination where possible. \n \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 3 of 27\n20 U.S.C. §§ 9531–67.  These centers have different structures, missions, and statutory \nmandates. \nThe Institute has flexibility on how to carry out its statutory missions.  It can generally do \nso “directly or through grants, contracts, or cooperative agreements.”  20 U.S.C. § 9512.   \nTraditionally, it has relied heavily on contracts and contractors.  See, e.g., Jeffrey Mervis, \nCanceling Data Collections Could Imperil Efforts to Improve U.S. Education, Science (Feb. 12, \n2025), Ex. 9, Acad. ECF No. 14-11, at 3 (The Statistics Center “has fewer than 100 employees, \nand more than 1000 contractors.”).  It is also required to use contracts “to establish a networked \nsystem of 10 regional educational laboratories.”  20 U.S.C. § 9564(a).  These laboratories \nprovide “training . . . and technical assistance” to state and local education agencies and school \nboards.  Id. § 9564(f)(1).  They also “develop[e] and widely disseminat[e]” research and reports \nto help improve academic achievement.  Id. § 9564(f)(2). \n  The data collected and disbursed by the Institute’s subcomponents provides a high-\nresolution picture of the American education system.  The federal government has many uses for \nthis data, but it is not the only beneficiary of the Institute’s work.  The material is also an \ninformational treasure trove for nonprofit organizations and individual researchers.  This is by \ndesign.  Part of the Institute’s mission is to “provide parents, educators, students, researchers, \npolicymakers, and the general public with reliable information” and data about education issues.  \n20 U.S.C. § 9511(b)(1).  In furtherance of this mission, the Institute is statutorily required to \nmake its research and data publicly available.  20 U.S.C. § 9574 (“Subject to [confidentiality \nprovisions], data collected by the Institute . . . shall be made available to the public.”).  The \nstatutes for many of the individual centers echo the importance of public access, mandating \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 4 of 27\nvarying levels of data disclosure.  See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 9533(a)(7) (Research Center); id.  \n§ 9546(e)(2) (Statistics Center); id. §§ 9562(a)(2), (3) (Evaluation Center). \nThe number of studies and reports produced by the Institute is breathtaking, and many are \ncarried out by the Statistics Center through contracts.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 6-1, \nat 21–23.  It is unnecessary to construct a comprehensive list, but describing some will set the \nstage for Plaintiffs’ concerns. \nFirst, there is the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study.  See Assoc. Compl. ¶ 33.  \nThe Statistics Center oversees this study, which is designed to fulfill a statutory requirement to \nresearch how students are funding their educations and how the cost of attendance and ensuing \ndebt impacts them.  See 20 U.S.C. § 1015a(k); Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 22.  The Statistics \nCenter also oversees a National Assessment of Educational Progress, a statutorily required long-\nterm academic achievement trend assessment.  See 20 U.S.C. § 9622; Acad. Compl. ¶ 42. \nNext is the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, a database administered by \nthe Statistics Center.  Acad. Compl. ¶ 34 & n.10.  This system helps the Statistics Center “meet \nits mandate to report full and complete statistics on the condition of postsecondary education in \nthe United States.”  National Center for Education Statistics, NCES Handbook of Survey \nMethods - Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) [https://perma.cc/SQ2G-\nGXCP].  It includes a legion of data collected from Title IV-eligible colleges and universities.  \nSee id.  \nThere are also an assortment of Educational Longitudinal Studies that follow students \nover the course of their academic careers and beyond.  Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj., ECF No. 14-1, at \n6.  For example, the Beginning Postsecondary Students Longitudinal Study follows students \nthrough their post-high school educational journeys.  See National Center for Education \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 5 of 27\nStatistics, Beginning Postsecondary Students (BPS) [https://perma.cc/4WM4-95ZM].  There are \nlongitudinal studies for other age groups too, like kindergarteners.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 23 \n(discussing ECLS-K:2024). \n  The list goes on, but the Court will not.  This overview barely scratches the surface of the \nagency’s work, but it suffices to say that the Institute controls a complex web of studies and \neducation-related programs spanning every corner of the American education system.   \nWhile most of its research is public, the Institute must safeguard data containing \nindividually identifiable information.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 27–28.  Researchers who want \nto see this “restricted-use” data must get a license from the Institute.  The licenses can either be \n“physical” or “remote.”  Id. at 28.  Researchers with physical licenses get CDs that they can only \nuse in “cold rooms,” meaning standalone desktop computers in secure locations disconnected \nfrom the internet.  Id.  Researchers with remote licenses can use a web-based portal through their \nown computer from anywhere.  Id. \nBut things started to change earlier this year.  On February 10, 2025, at the urging of the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency, the Institute began canceling large swathes of the \ncontracts it uses to implement its studies and programs.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21.  Waves \nof cancellations followed in the days to come.  See id. at 24–25.  Many agency functions ground \nto a halt, including the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study, the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress, and the ECLS-K:2024 longitudinal study of kindergarteners, to name a \nfew.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 22–23 (identifying programs and corresponding contract \naward IDs that have been cancelled).  But it was not just contracts getting axed.  The Institute \nalso announced in an email on February 10 that it is terminating the remote-access program for \nrestricted-use data.  See Voight Decl. Ex. 1, Assoc. ECF No. 6-10, at 11.  And on March 11, the \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 6 of 27\nSecretary of Education announced a reduction-in-force (“RIF”) to reduce the agency’s staffing \nby 50%, though Plaintiffs maintain the actual percentage ended up even higher.  See Assoc. Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. at 26–27; Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 20.  Finally, on March 20, the President issued \nan Executive Order directing the Secretary of Education to “facilitate the closure of the \nDepartment of Education” “to the maximum extent appropriate and permitted by law.”  Exec. \nOrder No. 14242, 90 Fed. Reg. 13679 (Mar. 20, 2025). \n  This litigation and the two preliminary injunction motions followed in late April.  There \nare two cases, both against the Department of Education and the Secretary of Education \n(collectively, “the Department”).  Each case has two Plaintiffs.  Plaintiffs in the first case (No. \n25-cv-999) are the Association for Education Finance and Policy and the Institute for Higher \nEducation Policy.  The first organization strives to “provide a forum for discussion and debate as \nto what drives effective education and related services” for people of all ages.  Assoc. Compl. ¶ \n9.  The second focuses on “research, policy, and advocacy” surrounding access to postsecondary \neducation.  Id. ¶ 10.  They and their members rely on Institute-produced data for these activities.  \nSee Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 31–36. \nPlaintiffs in the second case (No. 25-cv-1266) are the National Academy of Education \nand the National Council on Measurement in Education.  The former works to “advance[] high-\nquality research to improve education policy and practice.”  Acad. Compl. ¶ 12.  The latter is a \nprofessional organization that promotes advancement in “assessment, evaluation, testing, and \nother aspects of educational measurement.”  Id. ¶ 13.  These Plaintiffs and their members also \nrely on data from the Institute in their activities.  See Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 11–16, 18–19. \nIn both cases, Plaintiffs allege the Department is taking steps to “dismantle” the Institute.  \nSee, e.g., Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 14 (The Department has started “to dismantle” the \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 7 of 27\nInstitute.); Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 25 (The Department is taking “action to dismantle” the \nInstitute.).  But no Plaintiff challenges the Executive Order itself—that is, the order actually \ndirecting the drawdown of the Department.  See Assoc. Reply, ECF No. 17, at 11 (“Plaintiffs do \nnot challenge an executive order.”); Acad. Reply, ECF No. 23, at 15 (“Plaintiffs’ claims are not \nbased on Presidential executive orders.”).  Instead, Plaintiffs focus mostly on agency actions that \npredate the Executive Order.  They challenge the decisions to cancel contracts, reduce staffing, \nand modify data access procedures, asserting those actions were arbitrary and capricious and \nviolated the Institute’s statutory mandates.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 37; Acad. Mot. \nPrelim. Inj. at 20.  All Plaintiffs invoke the APA, with another constitutional challenge from \neach.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 2; Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 3. \nAfter Plaintiffs moved for preliminary injunctions, the Court held a joint hearing.  See \nPrelim. Inj. Hearing Tr. (“Hr’g Tr.”), Assoc. ECF No. 20 and Acad. ECF No. 25; see also Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 42(a) (authorizing joint hearings).  All parties had an opportunity to be heard.  Given \nthe substantial overlap in factual and legal issues, the Court addresses both cases in this opinion, \nbut it separately analyzes the distinct issues raised by the two cases when necessary.  Accord \nCntr. for Biological Diversity v. Trump, 453 F. Supp. 3d 11, 21 n.1 (D.D.C. 2020).   \nII. \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right,” but as \nan exercise of discretion by a court sitting in equity.  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 24 (2008).  The movant faces a high bar for success, as it must establish four elements \n“upon a clear showing”: (1) that it is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) that it likely will suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief; (3) that the balance of equities supports \ngranting the relief; and (4) that the public interest favors the injunction.  Id. at 20, 22.  Where, as \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 8 of 27\nhere, the Government is the party opposing injunctive relief, the latter two factors “merge.”  \nNken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).   \nWhile a successful plaintiff must make a clear showing across all four elements, a court \nneed not necessarily consider each prong to deny relief.  If a plaintiff fails to show that it is likely \nto succeed on the merits, a court may deny the preliminary injunction request without reaching \nthe remaining factors.  See Arkansas Dairy Co-op Ass’n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Agr., 573 F.3d 815, \n832 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (taking this approach); Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms & \nExplosives, 920 F.3d 1, 10 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (same); see also Winstead v. EMC Mortg. Corp., 621 \nF. Supp. 2d 1, 4–5 (D.D.C. 2009) (same). \nIII. \nNeither the Association nor the Academy has shown the APA is a viable cause of action \nfor their claims.  The APA can ferry discrete challenges to particular agency actions into court.  \nBut Plaintiffs pile aboard so many broad complaints that their claims sink underneath the sheer \nweight of the relief they seek.  The APA was not built to vindicate programmatic challenges to \nday-to-day agency operations, which is precisely what Plaintiffs assert.   \nAs for the constitutional claims, they are constitutional in name only.  They simply \nrepackage the impermissible APA claims and try to sneak them in through a constitutional back \ndoor.  But that door is locked by precedent.  So Plaintiffs have not made a “clear showing” that \nthey are likely to succeed on the merits of their claims.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  The Court will \nthus deny both motions for preliminary injunctions. \nA. \nUnder the APA, a person “suffering legal wrong because of agency action . . .  is entitled \nto judicial review thereof.”  5 U.S.C. § 702.  Courts are empowered to “hold unlawful and set \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 9 of 27\naside” a challenged agency action if it is “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or \notherwise not in accordance with law.”  Id. § 706(2).  To be reviewable, an agency action must \nbe “final,” meaning it (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s decisionmaking process” \nand (2) determines “rights or obligations” or “legal consequences will flow” from it.  Bennett v. \nSpear, 520 U.S. 154, 177–78 (1997) (cleaned up).   \nCourts “have long recognized that the term [agency action] is not so all-encompassing as \nto authorize . . . judicial review over everything done by an administrative agency.”  Indep. \nEquip. Dealers Ass’n v. EPA, 372 F.3d 420, 427 (D.C. Cir. 2004) (cleaned up).  The APA is a \nremedial scalpel, used to excise “circumscribed [and] discrete” improper actions.  Norton v. S. \nUtah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. 55, 62 (2004).  But it is the wrong tool for plaintiffs hoping to \nbludgeon through broad “programmatic” attacks that “demand a general judicial review of [an \nagency’s] day-to-day operations.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 899.   \nSome examples help shade these contours.  Start with Lujan itself.  There, the Bureau of \nLand Management (“BLM”) had a “land withdrawal review program.”  497 U.S. at 877.  The \nprogram was a collection of individual actions by which the BLM classified federally owned \nland into categories to designate how it could be used.  See id. at 877–78.  Enter the plaintiffs.  \nAt bottom, they wanted to invalidate the BLM’s classification decisions.  Id. at 879.  So they \nmounted an APA challenge against the agency’s classification program as a whole, alleging \nwidespread deficiencies.  See id. at 891.  The end goal was not merely to invalidate a few \nspecific decisions but to vitiate all of the agency’s classifications decisions.  Id. at 879. \nThe Supreme Court rejected the attempt.  Why?  Because “flaws in [an] entire \n‘program’—consisting principally of the many individual actions referenced in the complaint, \nand presumably actions yet to be taken as well—cannot be laid before the courts for wholesale \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 10 of 27\ncorrection under the APA.”2  Id. at 893.  The land classification program was not itself \nchallengeable because it was not a “single [agency] order or regulation, or even . . . a completed \nuniverse of particular [agency] orders and regulations.”  Id. at 890.  And while the plaintiffs \nidentified some specific decisions and showed harm from those decisions, that did not entitle \nthem to relief from “all such decisions.”  Id. at 882 (emphasis added).  The power to issue that \nsort of holistic change to agency operations belongs not to courts but to “the offices of the \nDepartment or the halls of Congress, where programmatic improvements are normally made.” \nId. at 891. \n  Another group of plaintiffs launched a similar challenge in Sierra Club v. Peterson, 228 \nF.3d 559 (5th Cir. 2000).  They objected to a Forest Service program that allowed “even-aged \ntimber management” when the government sold lumber—a technique where all the trees in a \ngiven area are cut down at the same time.  Id. at 562.  The plaintiffs identified some allegedly \nimproper sales under this program but did not limit their challenge to just those individual sales.  \nLike the Lujan plaintiffs, they tried to use these individual sales as bellwethers and then \nextrapolate the remedy to modify the entire timber management process.  See id. at 566 (They \n“challenged past, ongoing, and future timber sales.”).  But the court was not having it.  The Fifth \nCircuit rejected the plaintiffs’ attempt to “challenge an entire program by simply identifying \nspecific allegedly improper final agency actions within that program.”  Id. at 567 (emphasis \nadded).  Applying Lujan, the court concluded that large events comprised of many individual \nactions cannot be challenged “simply because one [action] . . . is ripe for review [and] adversely \n \n2  To be clear, there is a difference between improperly challenging a “program” that is not itself \nan action and properly challenging a “specific order or regulation” that “appl[ies] some particular \nmeasure across the board to” downstream agency decisions.  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 890 n.2.  \nPlaintiffs identify no such specific order here.  The most obvious candidate—the Executive \nOrder—post-dates most of the actions at issue here and has not been challenged by any Plaintiff. \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 11 of 27\naffects one of” the plaintiffs.  Id. at 568 (quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 893).  Thus, the proper \ncourse is to challenge only those “circumscribed [and] discrete” actions within a program—not \nthe entire program and every decision made under it.  S. Utah Wilderness All., 542 U.S. at 62. \nIn sum, plaintiffs cannot get “wholesale” improvement to agency operations under the \nAPA by bundling together a collection of discrete actions, presenting them as facets of a single \nevent, and then challenging that event instead of the individual actions.  See Lujan, 497 U.S. at \n893.  And plaintiffs cannot circumvent this restriction by purporting to challenge one or two \ndiscrete actions but then extrapolating the requested relief across the board so that it amounts to \n“wholesale” improvement.  See Peterson, 228 F.3d at 567–68. \nA recent D.C. Circuit decision is illustrative.  See Widakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL \n1288817, at *3 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025) (per curiam).  Much as the Lujan plaintiffs tried to unify \na series of discrete actions under a land management program, the Widakuswara plaintiffs sought \nto cast a series of individual personnel and grant actions as the embodiments of a decision to \n“dismantle” an agency.  See id.  While they identified some specific actions, they sought to \nleverage these individual challenges into broad relief that would prevent “wholesale shuttering” \nof the agency.  Id.  The court recognized that many of the “individual” actions the plaintiffs \nchallenged might allow for “viable, discrete claims.”  Id.  But “[t]he ‘dismantling’ that [the] \nplaintiffs allege[d] [was] a collection of ‘many individual actions’ that [could not] be packaged \ntogether and ‘laid before the courts for wholesale correction under the APA.’”  Id. (quoting \nLujan, 497 U.S. at 893); accord Found. on Economic Trends v. Lyng, 943 F.2d 79, 86 (D.C. Cir. \n1991).   \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 12 of 27\nTo be sure, Widakuswara was a non-precedential emergency stay decision.3  Id. at *1.  \nStill, it is a helpful representation of the APA’s limitations in a case that bears resemblance to \nthis dispute.  And it is to that dispute that the Court now turns. \nB. \n1. \nFirst on deck is the Association’s case (No. 25-cv-999).  The Association challenges four \nagency actions:  (1) “the decision to terminate programs by canceling contracts en masse”; (2) \n“the decision to terminate the Regional Educational Laboratory program”; (3) the “reduction-in-\nforce affecting 90% of [the Institute’s] staff”; and (4) the decision to “terminate[] the remote \naccess program for restricted-use data.”  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 37.  Despite purporting to \ntarget four individual actions, the Association’s framing of its case gives away the game and lays \nbare the true scope of its challenge. \nThe Association repeatedly presents this case as an attempt to stop the wholesale \n“dismantling” of the Institute.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 36 (alleging “the injuries to [the \nAssociation] . . . are caused by Defendants’ dismantling of [the Institute]”); id. at 46 \n(“Defendants’ actions to dismantle [the Institute] are contrary to” various statutes.); id. at 49 \n(“Defendants’ actions effectively dismantle [the Institute].”); id. at 49 (accusing the Department \nof taking “actions to shut down a statutorily created agency”).  As the Association succinctly put \n \n3 In Widakuswara, an appellate panel stayed two injunction provisions requiring the government \nto reinstate employees and restore grants.  2025 WL 1288817, at *1.  A series of Circuit en banc \norders—also non-precedential—declined to reconsider the stay of employee reinstatements but \ndid allow the grant restoration provision to take effect.  See Assoc. Not. Suppl. Auth., ECF No. \n22.  In doing so, the orders did not discuss Lujan or programmatic challenges.  See id. at 4–5 \n(May 22 order on employee reinstatements), 15–17 (May 28 order on grant restorations).  \nNotwithstanding these subsequent unpublished developments, the Court finds the Widakuswara \npanel’s Lujan discussion persuasive and considers it accordingly.   \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 13 of 27\nit:  “While Defendants have not completed the dismantling of [the Institute], they have taken at \nleast four discrete agency actions to carry out that goal”—the four actions the Association \nchallenges.  Id. at 37.   \nThe Complaint bundles these four actions together as well.  Count II lists them together \nrather than dividing them into individual challenges.  See Assoc. Compl. ¶¶ 89–99.  And Count \nIII, which alleges arbitrary and capricious action, does not even list the four specific actions at \nall.  See id. ¶¶ 100–02.  Instead, it lodges a general allegation that the Department acted \n“arbitrarily and capriciously by attempting to render an executive agency incapable of carrying \nout the statutory functions that Congress has directed it to fulfill.”  Id. ¶ 102. \nIn its quest to revivify the Institute, the Association seeks a remedy larger than the sum of \nthe individual injuries it alleges.  The overall goal is not incremental correction by fixing specific \nerroneous decisions, but a grand decree blocking all actions that risk “render[ing] an executive \nagency incapable of carrying out [its] statutory functions.”  Id.  To that end, the Association \nwants a sweeping order that “reinstate[s] any . . . research, data collection, or dissemination \nactivity that was terminated, halted, or paused” and imposes tight restrictions on when and how \nthe Institute can terminate any program in the future.  Assoc. Rev. Prop. Order., ECF No. 12-3, \n¶ 2.  That relief goes far beyond asking the Court to “hold unlawful and set aside” specific \nactions because they were flawed.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  Staffing levels, contract decisions, and \ndata access procedures are merely paths by which the Association seeks to dictate large-scale \nalterations in day-to-day agency operations.   \nBut the Association cannot contest the Department’s process of dismantling the Institute \n“by simply identifying specific allegedly improper final agency actions within that program.”  \nPeterson, 228 F.3d at 567 (emphasis added).  To the extent that unilateral dismantlement (or \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 14 of 27\nlarge-scale reorganization) is underway, it is not challengeable as a final agency action any more \nthan the land classification process in Lujan was challengeable.  And it cannot be “laid before the \ncourts for wholesale correction under the APA.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 893.  The Department \nargues as much in both cases.  Opp’n to Assoc. Mot., ECF No. 16, at 32–33; Opp’n to Acad. \nMot., ECF No. 21, at 22–23. \nThe programmatic nature of the Association’s challenge dooms its motion.  The Court \nneed go no further to deny the preliminary injunction as to these APA claims.  But the problems \nwith the Association’s case do not end there, and explaining the other flaws helps further \nilluminate why this is a programmatic challenge. \n2. \nExamining the purported final agency actions drives the point home.  Start with the \ncontract cancellations.  The Association gestures at a “decision” to “terminate programs by \ncanceling contracts en masse.”  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 37.  Yet it is unclear from the \nAssociation’s facts that these cancellations all stem from a single decision.  Indeed, its timeline \nsuggests otherwise.  To the extent that there was a single decision, the Association has not \nidentified it so the Court can hardly review it.   \nRemember, the contracts were not all axed in one fell swoop.  Most cancellations were \nclustered between February 9 and February 11.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21.  But others \nhappened later.  The Association specifically mentions contract cancellations on February 13, \nFebruary 19, and even March 10.  Id. at 24–25.  And at least one cancelled contract was \nreinstated in late February, suggesting the agency was continuing to evaluate contracts in some \ncapacity after February 10.  Id. at 25.  All of this indicates that the Association is improperly \nbundling together a series of actions for wholesale correction rather than challenging one \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 15 of 27\n“circumscribed [and] discrete” action.  S. Utah Wilderness All, 542 U.S. at 62.  The \nAssociation’s strategy echoes those unsuccessfully fielded by the Lujan and Peterson plaintiffs.  \nIt is trying to use a few specific contract cancellations as bellwethers to bring about large scale \nchanges—mass program reimplementation and general statutory compliance—across the \nInstitute. \nThe proposed preliminary injunction order also reflects a programmatic focus.  The \nAssociation asks not just for reinstatement of contracts, but also reinstatement of “any . . . \nresearch, data collection, or dissemination activity that was terminated, halted, or paused.”  \nAssoc. Rev. Prop. Order. ¶ 2.  The supremacy of programs, not contracts, is further evident from \nthe Association’s uncertainty as to exactly how many contract terminations are included in its \nchallenge.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 21 (perhaps 90 but maybe “as many as 170 \ncontracts”).  The briefing points that direction too, with headers that focus on the big-picture \n“termination of [the Institute’s] research and dissemination activities”—not the termination of its \ncontracts.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 40; see also id. at 46.  All of this indicates the true focus is \nwholesale correction, not remediation for a narrow band of erroneous decisions. \nThe Supreme Court’s warning in Southern Utah rings true here:  “If courts were \nempowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they \nwould necessarily be empowered, as well, to determine whether compliance was achieved.”  542 \nU.S. at 66.  Such a framework would inevitably devolve into judicial supervision, and it would \nbecome “the task of the supervising court, rather than the agency, to work out compliance with \nthe broad statutory mandate.”  Id. at 66–67.  Judges were never meant to be czars overseeing the \nday-to-day affairs of agencies.  Thus, the Association’s challenge to the mass termination of \nprograms via contract cancellations is precisely the sort of broadside attack that Lujan forbids.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 16 of 27\nAnd the general statutory compliance it seeks as relief runs counter to Southern Utah.  More, this \nobjection to scores—hundreds?—of  cancelled contracts is just one of the four targets of the \nAssociation’s ire.   \nThe Association’s challenge to the RIF fares no better.  It contests the “reduction-in-force \ngenerally, not . . . anything particular about how it was carried out.”  Assoc. Reply at 10–11 \n(cleaned up).  Unsurprisingly then, the primary focus is not on the RIF itself, but “the cessation \nof . . . activities [caused] by the reduction-in-force.”  Id. at 11 (emphasis added).  In other words, \nthe Association does not assert the agency lacked the authority to conduct the RIF, that the \nagency violated procedural requirements in carrying out the RIF, or that it or its members have \nany direct stake in the underlying personnel actions.4 \nThat leaves the Association to challenge the diasporic results of the RIF, rather than the \ndecision to implement it.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 42, 46 (warning the RIF will result in \nwidespread statutory deficiencies).  In essence, the Association asks the Court to decide not \nwhether the RIF was carried out properly, but whether it should have been carried out at all.  It is \nnot the place of this Court to substitute its own judgment for that of the agency on staffing issues.  \nDoing so would be tantamount to “general judicial review of the [Institute’s] day-to-day” \nemployment decisions.  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 899.   The Association is “merely us[ing]” the RIF \n“as evidence to support [its] sweeping argument that the [Institute’s] ‘on-the-ground’ \n \n4  Indeed, it appears unlikely that either organization or their members would have standing to \nchallenge the RIF itself.  After all, they have no direct stake in the Institute’s employment \ndecisions because “the plaintiffs. . . lack . . . employment relationships with the federal \ngovernment.”  Assoc. Reply at 1.  And even if they did have an employment relationship, \n“federal employees may not use the [APA] to challenge agency employment actions.”  Filebark \nv. U.S. Dep’t of Transp., 555 F.3d 1009, 1010 (D.C. Cir. 2009). \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 17 of 27\nmanagement” of its statutorily mandated programs is deficient.  Peterson, 228 F.3d at 567.  \nLujan closed the door on challenges like this—and Southern Utah nailed it shut. \nNext, the “decision to terminate the Regional Educational Laboratory program.”  Assoc. \nMot. Prelim. Inj. at 37.  The Association does not even mention the Laboratory terminations in \nits proposed injunction, much less seek any specific relief as to that decision.  See Assoc. Rev. \nProp. Order.  The lack of a request for an independent remedy underscores that the Laboratory \nterminations are really one piece of a broader challenge to the “dismantling” of the Institute. \nFinally, consider the termination of the remote access program.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. \nInj. at 37.  On the surface, this challenge looks more like standard APA fare.  It targets one \nclearly identifiable decision to terminate one discrete program, see id., and the proposed \ninjunction mentions that decision.  See Assoc. Rev. Prop. Order. ¶ 7.  So the claim might be \nviable if brought as a standalone APA challenge.  The problem for the Association is that it did \nnot bring the remote access claim as a standalone challenge.  See Found. on Economic Trends, \n943 F.2d at 86 (“[T]he many individual actions referenced in the record . . . cannot be laid before \nthe courts for wholesale correction even if one happens to be ripe for review and is adversely \naffecting one of the plaintiffs . . . .”) (cleaned up). \nRemember, Count II (contrary to law) bundles remote access in with the other issues \nwhile challenging the Department’s overall “decision to end the programs and activities of [the \nInstitute].”  See Assoc. Compl. ¶ 90; id. ¶¶ 89–99.  And Count III (arbitrary and capricious) \nfocuses on the “attempt[] to render an executive agency incapable of carrying out . . . statutory \nfunctions” without directly mentioning remote access.  Assoc. Compl. ¶ 102.  When viewed in \ncontext, the remote access termination is being used as evidence of the Association’s bigger \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 18 of 27\ncontention that “violation of the law is rampant within” the attempt to dismantle the Institute.  \nLujan, 497 U.S. at 891.   \nTrue, the Association has “identified some specific [decisions] in [its] pleadings that [it] \nargue[s] are final agency actions.”  Peterson, 228 F.3d at 567.  And true, the APA lets the \nAssociation “challenge a specific final agency action which has an actual or immediately \nthreatened effect.”  Id. (cleaned up).  But daisy-chaining those premises together still does not let \nthe Association “challenge an entire program by simply identifying specific allegedly-improper \nfinal agency actions within that program, which is precisely what [it] did here.”  Id. \n3. \nIt should come as no surprise that Lujan bars the Association’s way.  The Court \nforecasted these concerns at oral argument and asked the Association for its best cases to show \nwhy Lujan does not prevent its APA challenges.  Hr’g Tr. at 30:17–19.  The Association gave \ntwo cases:  Meina Xie v. Kerry, 780 F.3d 405 (D.C. Cir. 2015) and American Fuel & \nPetrochemical Manufacturers v. Environmental Protection Agency, 937 F.3d 559 (D.C. Cir. \n2019).  Hr’g Tr. at 30:20–31:8.  Neither does much for it. \nXie was a visa mandamus case involving an attempt to compel agency action under the \nAPA.  780 F.3d at 405.  The case does not cite Lujan or consider its ban on programmatic \nchallenges.  Xie does, however, briefly discuss Southern Utah.  Id. at 407–08.  Its takeaway from \nSouthern Utah is that courts can compel agencies to act if action is legally required, but plaintiffs \ncannot ask for a general “compliance” order that requires judicial management of daily agency \ntasks.  See id. at 408.  Nothing in that conclusion conflicts with the Court’s decision today. \nAmerican Fuel at least mentions Lujan and programmatic challenges, albeit briefly.  The \npetitioners challenged an Environmental Protection Agency final rule involving renewable \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 19 of 27\nenergy production targets for the fuel market.  Am. Fuel, 937 F.3d at 568.  They protested that \nthe agency did not “comply with the requirements” in the Endangered Species Act because it \nfailed to consult another agency to ensure the rule would not harm endangered species.  Id. at \n591.  Although the petitioners criticized a broader renewable energy program the final rule was \npart of, “their actual challenge [was] to the . . . Rule.”  Id.  So the challenge was not \nprogrammatic because it targeted one agency action—the promulgation of a final rule—and \nalleged that the agency’s procedure in making the rule violated one provision in the Endangered \nSpecies Act.  See Pet. ¶ 2, No. 18-1040 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 9, 2018).  That contrasts with the \nAssociation’s contention that the Department violated at least a dozen different statutory \nprovisions by canceling one-hundred-plus contracts, instituting a RIF, terminating ten separate \nRegional Educational Laboratories, and modifying data access procedures.  The Association’s \ncase bears far more resemblance to Lujan than to American Fuel.  So neither of the Association’s \ntwo strongest cases save it. \n4. \nThe Association also tries its luck at a separation of powers claim grounded in the same \nconduct as its APA challenges.5  But the Supreme Court has rejected the notion “that every \naction by the President, or by another executive official, in excess of his statutory authority is \nipso facto in violation of the Constitution.”  Dalton v. Specter, 511 U.S. 462, 472 (1994).  To the \ncontrary, courts “often distinguish[] between claims of constitutional violations and claims that \n \n5  The Association makes a passing reference to the Department’s actions being ultra vires too. \nAssoc. Prelim. Inj. Mot. at 49.  But it does not develop this argument so the Court does not \naddress it.  See New York Rehab. Care Mgmt., LLC v. N.L.R.B., 506 F.3d 1070, 1076 (D.C. Cir. \n2007) (declining to consider an argument that was “included [in] a heading” but not discussed \nfurther because “[i]t is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal \nway, leaving the court to do counsel’s work.”). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 20 of 27\nan official has acted in excess of his statutory authority.”  Id.  The Constitution is implicated \nwhen the challenged executive acts are taken by “inherent constitutional” authority or when the \nstatute the executive relies on for authority is itself unconstitutional.  See id. at 473 & n.5.  That \nis not the case here because the Association’s claim is based on executive officials violating \nstatutory requirements relating to the Institute’s mission. \nThe Association still contends that the overall decision to shut down an agency exists \noutside of statutory considerations, because only Congress has the “power to make a law” that \nshutters an agency.  See Assoc. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 49 (quoting Wilkerson v. Rahrer, 140 U.S. \n545, 562 (1891)).  But in the same breath, the Association says the Department acted “in direct \ncontravention of both the statutes that establish [the Institute] and its functions, and of 20 U.S.C. \n§ 3473(a), which prohibits the Secretary from ‘aboli[shing]’ any statutory entity within [the \nEducation Department].”  Id. (emphasis added).  So it is truly alleging a statutory violation, not a \nconstitutional issue.  Plus, the Association expressly disavows any challenge to the Executive \nOrder, the only thing resembling a shutdown order that it has flagged.  Assoc. Reply at 11; \nOpp’n to Assoc. Mot. at 33–34.  The Association is left instead to rely on the same concern that \nanimates its APA claims:  the Institute is allegedly not performing functions that statutes require \nit to perform.  The attempt at a constitutional claim is just a repackaging of the APA challenge.  \nDalton forecloses that option, as “claims simply alleging that the [executive branch] has \nexceeded [its] statutory authority are not ‘constitutional’ claims.”  511 U.S. at 473.  Thus for the \nAssociation’s so-called constitutional claim, it is unlikely to succeed on the merits because it \nfails to state a claim for relief altogether.   \n* * * \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 21 of 27\nAt this early stage, the Court is unconvinced the APA gets the Association where it wants \nto go.  The Association’s plea for the Court to step in and stop the “dismantling” of the Institute \nis a request for the sort of programmatic relief reserved for “the offices of the Department or the \nhalls of Congress.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891.  True, some of the individual actions the Association \nidentifies may be ripe for standalone challenges, such as the end of the remote access program.  \nBut as currently structured, these individual claims are impermissibly bundled as part of a larger \nprogrammatic challenge.  The Association has chosen to swing for the fences, in hopes it will get \neverything it wants.  But that is a losing gambit.  “The ‘dismantling’ that plaintiffs allege is a \ncollection of ‘many individual actions’ that cannot be packaged together and ‘laid before the \ncourts for wholesale correction under the APA.’”  Widakuswara, 2025 WL 1288817, at *3 \n(quoting Lujan, 497 U.S. at 893).  At the preliminary injunction stage, it is on the Association to \nmake “a clear showing” that it has a cause of action under the APA.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.  It \nhas not met that burden.6 \nC. \nTurn next to the Academy’s case (No. 25-cv-1266).  The second case encompasses \ndistinct claims and different Plaintiffs, but the analysis follows a similar trajectory.  The \nAcademy challenges three things:  “(1) the February 10, 2025 announced cancellation of over \n$900 million in [Institute] contracts, some of which are critical to the basic functioning of [the \nInstitute] and to the realization of many . . . congressional mandates; (2) the March 11, 2025 \nannounced RIF of 90% of [Institute] staff including 97% of NCES staff; and (3) the February \n \n6  As part of its “contrary to law” argument under the APA, the Association also claims \nviolations of the Impoundment Control Act and the Anti-Deficiency Act.  Assoc. Mot. Prelim. \nInj. at 48.  Having already found that the Association’s claims are likely programmatic, the Court \ndoes not address these separately because they are part of the same wholesale challenge. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 22 of 27\n2025 termination of all remote restricted-use data licenses and the end of accepting new \napplications for these licenses.”  Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 20.  But again, the framing and the \nrequested relief give away the game.  This is a programmatic challenge in disguise. \nThe Academy contends that the Department “took action to dismantle [the Institute].”  Id. \nat 25.  And each discrete decision was a step toward the “goal of dismantling [the Institute].”  Id. \nat 6.  So the Academy says the harms it is experiencing “are traceable to Defendants’ \ndismantling of [the Institute].”  Id. at 19.  The Complaint follows the same pattern, focusing on \nthe Department’s “dismantlement” of the Institute as the primary issue.  See Acad. Compl. ¶¶ \n112, 117 (Count II); id. ¶¶ 122, 123 (Count III).  The focus of the relief is also general statutory \ncompliance, not the individual actions the Academy purports to challenge.   \nFor instance, the Academy explains that it “only reference[s] contracts because” the \nInstitute relies “on contracts . . . to accomplish [its] statutorily required duties.”  Acad. Reply at \n4.  The “requested relief seeks to ensure that [the Institute] can operate as statutorily required . . . \nwithout regard to whether any one contract is in effect or not.”  Id. at 3.  In fact, the Academy \nsurmises, the contracts would not need to be reinstated if the Institute just “hire[d] sufficient . . . \nemployees to accomplish [its] statutory duties.”  Id. at 4.  Put another way, the Academy is \nchallenging the decision to cancel contracts, but it does not really care about the decision to \ncancel contracts.  It cares about the Institute’s failure to perform a wide array of statutorily \nmandated functions.   \nThe same holds true for the decision to end remote access for restricted-use data.  See \nAcad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 20.  It is telling that the Academy’s proposed injunction makes no \nmention at all of the remote-access program.  See Acad. Prop. Order, ECF No. 14-34.  Instead, it \nwants the Institute to restore “sufficient employee positions” to “ensure that,” among other \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 23 of 27\nthings, the Institute “grant[s] and renew[s] restricted-use data licenses.”  Id.  It would be a \nsurprising thing for the Academy to argue a decision was erroneous but then not request a \ncorresponding remedy if the issue were truly an independent challenge.  But these purportedly \nindividual challenges are merely alter egos of the Academy’s holistic dissatisfaction with daily \nagency operations. \nThen there is the Tucker Act.  When a dispute involves a government contract, district \ncourts must undertake a specific analysis to decide whether the Tucker Act divests the court of \njurisdiction.  See Transohio Sav. Bank v. Dir., Off. of Thrift Supervision, 967 F.2d 598, 609 (D.C. \nCir. 1992) (“[T]his Court and others have interpreted the Tucker Act as providing the exclusive \nremedy for contract claims against the government.”).  The Tucker Act requires case-by-case \nassessment based on the source of a plaintiff’s rights and the nature of the relief sought.  See \nAlbrecht v. Comm. on Emp. Benefits of Fed. Rsrv. Emp. Benefits Sys., 357 F.3d 62, 68 (D.C. Cir. \n2004).  For instance, asking a court to reinstate a contract—the relief sought here—can look a lot \nlike a jurisdictionally improper order for specific performance.  See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United \nStates, 780 F.2d 74, 80 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (“[A] request for specific performance must be resolved \nby the Claims Court.”); accord U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops v. U.S. Dep’t of State, --- F. Supp. \n3d ---, 2025 WL 76738, at *5 (D.D.C. 2025).  Maybe it is, maybe not.  But either way, courts at \nleast need to ask these questions when dealing with government contract disputes. \nThe Tucker Act looms large here because some Academy members perform work under \nInstitute contracts and could likely show harm from the cancellation of those contracts.  See \nDecl. of Andrew Ho, Acad. ECF No. 14-12, ¶ 21; Decl. of Derek Briggs, Acad. ECF No. 14-14, \n¶ 9, 13.  It is unclear how many other members are party to Institute contracts or whether the \norganizations themselves have contracts.  But the Court would likely lack jurisdiction to hear any \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 24 of 27\nindividual contract challenge brought by the organizations or their members if it resembled a \ntraditional contract claim.  See Albrecht, 357 F.3d at 67–68 (explaining that the Tucker Act \nextends to contract cases involving “injunctive relief”).  In other words, the Tucker Act might \nbar members from individually seeking the relief that the Academy now seeks for all of them.  \nAllowing potentially prohibited individual claims to move forward simply because the Academy \nhas bundled them together risks vitiating the jurisdictional limitations Congress imposed in the \nTucker Act.  Given the “extraordinary” and discretionary nature of the relief sought, see Winter, \n555 U.S. at 24, this Court is reluctant to take such a step.   \nLike the Association, the Academy is seeking wholesale correction of general agency \noperations and bundling together claims to pursue outsized relief.  It wants a court order for the \nInstitute to “reinstate and maintain all congressionally mandated data collection, analysis, and \ndissemination activities.”  Acad. Prop. Order ¶ 2.  But that relief necessarily involves a muddled \n“general order[] compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates.”  S. Utah Wilderness \nAll., 542 U.S. at 66.  Such an order would inevitably lead to enforcement disputes and require the \nCourt “to determine whether compliance was achieved.”  Id.  The Court cannot scrutinize the \nminutiae of how the Institute’s multitudes of studies are carried out.  Such questions are best left \nto “expert judgment of agencies specifically created to deal with complex and technical issues.”  \nPeterson, 228 F.3d at 566.  In short, the relief the Academy desires cannot be found in a \ncourtroom.  They are instead the province of “the halls of Congress, where programmatic \nimprovements are normally made.”  Lujan, 497 U.S. at 891.  Thus, the Academy has not made “a \nclear showing” that it has a cause of action under the APA.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 22.   \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 25 of 27\n* * * \nSeparate from its APA claims, the Academy also asserts a separation of powers \nviolation.7  It tries to season it differently by sprinkling in the Take Care Clause, but it still tastes \nthe same as the APA claims.  See Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 26–29.  The focus remains a \ngeneralized displeasure over the Institute’s failure to comply with its statutory mandates.   \nAt the start, the Court notes that “[w]hether claims brought directly under the Take Care \nClause are even justiciable is open to debate.”  Citizens for Resp. & Ethics in Wash. v. Trump, \n302 F. Supp. 3d 127, 130 (D.D.C. 2018), aff’d, 924 F.3d 602 (D.C. Cir. 2019).  Even if such \nclaims are justiciable, the Academy’s Complaint does not raise the Take Care Clause—only a \nseparation of powers claim premised on the executive’s attempt to “dismantle” the agency.  See \nAcad. Compl. ¶ 129; see also Opp’n to Acad. Mot. at 32 (pointing this out).  So the Academy \ncannot now add a new basis for relief in its motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Sai v. \nTransp. Sec. Admin., 54 F. Supp. 3d 5, 9 (D.D.C. 2014).  Plus, both the Take Care Clause and the \nseparation of powers issues are just doppelgängers of the Academy’s APA claim.  The Academy \nsimply reiterates how the executive is “hamstringing [the Institute’s] ability to fulfill its \ncongressional mandates.”  Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 27.  As the Department argues, if every \nstatutory compliance issue triggered separation of powers concerns, virtually all APA cases \nwould balloon into disputes of constitutional proportions.  See Opp’n to Acad. Mot. at 31.  \n \n7  The Complaint and reply brief include an ultra vires claim too, but the Academy never \nmentioned it in the initial preliminary injunction motion.  See Acad. Mot. Prelim. Inj. at 20–29 \n(discussing the APA and separation of powers only); Acad. Reply at 17 (arguing a likelihood of \nsuccess on the ultra vires claim).  It is a “basic precept that arguments generally are forfeited if \nraised for the first time in reply” or if a party was initially “obscure on the issue . . . and only \nwarmed to the issue in their reply brief.”  Twin Rivers Paper Co. LLC v. Sec. & Exch. Comm’n, \n934 F.3d 607, 615 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (cleaned up).  So the ultra vires claim is forfeited for \npurposes of the preliminary injunction because the Court is now ruling only on the Academy’s \nmotion, not the Complaint. \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 26 of 27\nAgain, not every statutory violation by an executive agency “is ipso facto in violation of the \nConstitution.”  Dalton, 511 U.S. at 472.  The Court will not rush to read constitutional issues into \nAPA claims simply because a plaintiff invokes constitutional language.  And to the extent that \nthe Executive Order might be more susceptible to constitutional claims, the Academy does not \nchallenge it.  See Acad. Reply at 2.  So the Academy is unlikely to succeed on the merits of a \nseparation of powers or Take Care Clause challenge because it fails to state a plausible claim for \nrelief. \nD. \n  In sum, Plaintiffs’ failure to show that they are likely to succeed on the merits is fatal to \ntheir motions.  See Arkansas Dairy, 573 F.3d at 832.  This deficiency is weighty.  Even assuming \nthat Plaintiffs could prevail on the remaining factors, the overall balance still tips sharply against \ngranting a preliminary injunction.  See City of Las Vegas v. Lujan, 891 F.2d 927, 931 (D.C. Cir. \n1989) (explaining that district courts have “latitude” in balancing the factors, and that balancing \nreceives deference on appeal).  After all, without a likelihood of success, there is “no justification \nfor the court’s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration and judicial review.”  Am. \nBankers Ass’n v. Nat’l Credit Union Admin., 38 F. Supp. 2d 114, 140 (D.D.C. 1999) (quoting \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Comm’n v. Holiday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. \n1977)).   \nIt would be easier for Plaintiffs if they could resolve their array of concerns through a \nsingle APA action with sweeping relief.  It would probably drive some measure of judicial \nefficiency too.  But for better or worse, the Court is bound by the scope-of-review limitations \nCongress has imposed on the APA.  These limitations are necessary to “avoid encroaching on the \nother branches of government.”  Peterson, 228 F.3d at 566.  Fidelity to the law, not convenience, \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00999-TNM     Document 25     Filed 06/03/25     Page 27 of 27\nis the Court’s North Star.  As Plaintiffs themselves recognize in their briefs, separation of powers \nis vital.  Treating the APA as a panacea for whatever ails society would erode that separation and \ncall up the specter of judicial overreach. \nIV. \nFor these reasons, Plaintiffs’ motions for preliminary injunctions will both be denied.  \nSeparate orders will issue in each case. \n           \nDated: June 3, 2025          TREVOR N.
