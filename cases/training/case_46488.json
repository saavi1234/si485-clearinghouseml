The grants were designed to fund outbreak prevention programs and to ameliorate the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic. To terminate these grants, HHS and the CDC were statutorily required to make a determination that the individual recipient of a grant had in some way violated federal laws or regulations or the Constitution itself. HHS and the CDC did not undertake these case-by-case evaluations, instead ending the grants en masse and without alleging any violation of federal law by any of the grant recipients.

The lawsuit sued HHS and its Secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., as well as the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and its Acting Director. Plaintiffs sought vacatur of defendants&rsquo; grant termination decisions and an injunction requiring defendants to reinstate the cancelled grants, spend the money appropriated by Congress, and resume the normal operation of the grant programs; and attorneys&rsquo; fees.

Plaintiffs state and allege as follows: \n     INTRODUCTION \n1.  The COVID-19 pandemic ravaged American society, killing over a million people, \ndecimating the economy, and forever shifting our understanding of public health. In response, \nCongress appropriated billions of dollars for programs designed to remedy the effects of that \npandemic and to prepare for similar threats to the public health from infectious diseases. Some of \nthis money (e.g. the American Rescue Plan Act) went to rebuilding the American economy. And \nsome went to fund important public health programs around the country and prepare governments \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 55\nand other stakeholders to respond to other public health emergencies, especially those involving \ninfectious diseases. Having seen the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress understood \nthat America needed to be better prepared for potential outbreaks of communicable disease.  \n2.  Counties and cities across the United States benefitted from this funding. The \nmoney has supported the important and cutting-edge public health work of identifying, monitoring, \nand  addressing  infectious  diseases;  ensuring  access  to  necessary  immunizations,  including \nimmunizations for children; and strengthening emergency preparedness to avoid future pandemics. \nBecause local governments are often the first line of defense during a public health emergency, \nthese programs allowed local governments to expand and improve their ability to identify and \nrespond to public health crises like communicable disease outbreaks. \n3.  Like  many  issues  these  days,  the  COVID-19  pandemic—and  governments’ \nresponses to it—became politicized. Debates over mask mandates, vaccinations, remote schooling, \nand other issues have raged since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued \nafter the public health emergency ended. When President Donald Trump took office for his second \nterm, he made dismantling the federal government’s approach to COVID-19 a priority. He issued \na rescission of executive orders issued by President Joe Biden related to the COVID-19 pandemic, \nincluding orders designed to prevent future pandemics and build a sustainable public health \nworkforce.1 \n4.  And on March 24, 2025, President Trump’s picks to lead the Department of Health \nand Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control unilaterally eliminated congressionally \nappropriated federal grants that provide over $11 billion to Plaintiff Local Governments and other \n \n1 See Exec. Order No. 13,996, 86 Fed. Reg. 7197 (Jan. 26, 2021); Exec. Order No. 13,997, 86 \nFed. Reg. 7201 (Jan. 26, 2021); Exec. Order No. 14,002, 86 Fed. Reg. 7229 (Jan. 27, 2021). \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 55\nentities for programs designed to address the effects of the pandemic and to prepare communities \nfor future potential outbreaks. The funding, which Plaintiff Local Governments received both \nthrough existing and new grant programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, was not limited to the \nduration of the pandemic. Indeed, the funding was generally expected to address the effects of the \npandemic and prepare Plaintiff Local Governments for future public health crises.  \n5.  Defendants’ decision to terminate these “COVID-related” CDC grant programs en \nmasse (the “Mass Termination Decision”) was done in one fell swoop. Contravening Congress’s \ndecision to extend funding for pandemic preparedness, Defendants announced that they would “no \nlonger waste billions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans \nmoved on from years ago.” Brandy Zadrozny, CDC is pulling back $11B in Covid funding sent to \nhealth departments across the U.S., NBC News (Mar. 25, 2025), https://perma.cc/35SS-V2WE. \nNeeding  cover  for  their  obviously  illegal  actions,  Defendants  provided  a  cursory  basis  for \ntermination of the programs: they had been terminated for “cause.” Defendants explained their \ndecision to summarily terminate the programs by stating threadbare variations of: “The end of the \n[COVID-19] pandemic provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants.”  \n6.  But Defendants’ belief that the end of the COVID-19 pandemic justifies an end to \nall COVID-related expenditures cannot be a lawful basis to terminate the programs at issue “for \ncause.”       If Defendants wanted to terminate any of the Plaintiff Local Governments’ funding “for \ncause,” they were required to do so via individual determinations—determinations that ordinarily \nrequire some form of noncompliance with the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, regulations, or \nterms and conditions of the federal award. See 45 C.F.R. §§ 75.371-75.375 (“Remedies for \nNoncompliance”). The termination letters issued to Plaintiff Local Governments do not identify \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 55\nany failures to comply on their part; nor could they, as Plaintiff Local Governments have complied \nwith the terms of the respective grants, something which Defendants do not dispute. \n7.  Defendants’ proffered reason for the Mass Termination Decision makes even less \nsense given the way in which Congress appropriated the funds. Congress did not limit this funding \nto the period of the COVID-19 emergency nor even to COVID-19-specific projects. Instead, \nmotivated by the fact that public health departments were unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic, \nCongress made wide-ranging investments in U.S. public health infrastructure designed to extend \nbeyond the immediate public health emergency. Moreover, after the end of the COVID-19 public \nhealth emergency, Congress reviewed the COVID-19-related appropriations and rescinded certain \nfunds but decided not to rescind any of the funds at issue.  \n8.  The  Mass  Termination  Decision  has  been  devastating  to  Plaintiff  Local \nGovernments’ public health departments and their employees, including public health employee \nmembers of Plaintiff AFSCME. With the cessation of these grant programs, the public health \ndepartments run by Plaintiff Local Governments will need to cease critical operations and lay off \nstaff—and indeed these layoffs have already begun, with AFSCME members losing their jobs. \nThe Mass Termination Decision is also a massive blow to U.S. public health generally, at a time \nwhere state and local public health departments need to address burgeoning infectious diseases \nand chronic illnesses, like the measles, bird flu, and mpox.  \n9.  The Mass Termination Decision is unlawful for multiple reasons. First, unilaterally \nterminating  funds  as  Defendants  have  done  violates  the  U.S.  Constitution.  Nothing  in  the \nConstitution empowers agencies—or the President—to usurp Congress’s exclusive power of the \npurse and refuse to spend appropriated funds for the purposes Congress specified.  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 55\n10.  Second, Defendants’ actions violate Congress’s appropriation statutes, which make \nno mention of termination upon the conclusion of the COVID-19 public health emergency. Indeed, \nCongress’s actions after the emergency was declared over indicate that Congress did not want the \nfunding to end in the way Defendants terminated it. \n11.  Third, Defendants’ actions violate HHS’s own regulations, which narrowly limit \nthe grounds for terminating federal grants. The regulation certainly does not give Defendants \nauthority to renege en masse on their grant obligations or to effectively impound appropriated \nfunds in defiance of Congress.  \n12.  Finally, the Mass  Termination Decision is arbitrary and capricious and lacks \nreasoned  explanation.  Among  other  things,  the  explanation  given  for  the  terminations—\nDefendants’ uninformed conclusion that the grants are “no longer necessary” because the COVID-\n19 public health emergency ended—is based on factors that Congress did not intend Defendants \nto consider and improperly assumes without support that the funds were only intended for \npandemic-related use.       \n13.  Defendants’  actions  have  caused  Plaintiffs  multiple,  ongoing  harms.  The \nterminations will lead to immediate cessation of grant-funded projects and threaten to deprive \nPlaintiff Local Governments’ residents of essential public health services—all in the midst of \ncontinuing dangers posed by COVID-19 and other diseases, including deadly measles outbreaks \nin Texas, Ohio, Tennessee, Missouri, and other states across the country. The abrupt, retroactive \ntermination of programs that provide millions of dollars in funding that Plaintiffs have relied upon \nfor years threatens to halt Plaintiff Local Governments’ necessary and lifesaving ongoing public \nhealth work, including work to keep deadly infectious diseases from spreading. Absent prompt \nrelief from this Court, the consequences of Defendants’ actions will be devastating.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 55\n14.  Accordingly, through this lawsuit, Plaintiffs bring this action against Defendants \nHHS, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., CDC, and CDC Acting Director Susan Monarez \nseeking to: vacate and set aside the wholesale elimination of CDC’s COVID-19-related grant \nprograms; preliminarily and permanently enjoin Defendants to reinstate the eliminated grant \nprograms and to continue to administer the grant to the same extent and in the same manner as \nprior to the unlawful terminations, as provided in the notices of award and HHS regulations; and \nto declare that the terminations violate the U.S. Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act \n(“APA”). \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n15.  This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 because this action arises \nunder Article I and Article II of the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the APA, \n5 U.S.C. §§ 701–706. \n16.  The Court has authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide temporary, \npreliminary, and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure; the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201–2202; the All Writs Act, 28 \nU.S.C. § 1651; and the Court’s inherent equitable powers. The Administrative Procedure Act \nfurther authorizes the Court to grant temporary and permanent relief from agency action. 5 U.S.C. \n§§ 705–706. \n17.  Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b) and (e) because a substantial part of the \nevents or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this judicial district, Defendants are \nUnited States agencies and officers sued in their official capacities, and at least one Plaintiff and \nat least one Defendant resides in and has its principal place of business in this district. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 8 of 55\nPARTIES \n18.  Plaintiff Harris County (“Harris County”) is a local government entity located in \nthe state of Texas. With a population exceeding 4.8 million people, Harris County is the most \npopulous county in Texas and the third most populous county in the United States. The county’s \ngoverning body is the Harris County Commissioners Court, which is responsible for “all county \nbusiness,” Tex. Const. art. V, § 18(b), including “protect[ing] the public health.” Tex. Health & \nSafety Code § 121.003(a). The grants at issue in this action enable Harris County to fulfill its duty \nto protect the health and welfare of its residents. Harris County administers the projects funded by \nthese grants through the Harris County Public Health Department (“Harris County Public Health” \nor “HCPH”), a county agency. HCPH provides a broad range of critical public health services to \nHarris County residents. \n19.  Plaintiff the City of Columbus (“Columbus”) is a municipal corporation organized \nunder Ohio law. See Ohio Const., art. XVIII. Columbus is the capital of Ohio. It is the largest city \nin the state and the fourteenth largest city in the United States, with a population of over 905,000, \naccording to 2020 Census estimates. Columbus’s public health department, Columbus Public \nHealth, provides a wide range of health care services on behalf of its residents including infectious \ndisease  investigation,  mitigation,  and  community  response  coordination.  Columbus  receives \nfunding from CDC to strengthen its disease response, workforce capacity, and health information \nsystems. \n20.  Plaintiff  the  Metropolitan  Government  of  Nashville  &  Davidson  County \n(“Nashville”) is a combined municipal corporation and county government organized and existing \nunder Tennessee law. Nashville is the largest city in Tennessee, with a population of more than \n650,000 people. Nashville’s Public Health Department’s mission is to protect, improve and sustain \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 55\nthe health and well-being of all people in Nashville and Davidson County. It provides a long list \nof services to residents, including clinical health services, epidemiological tracking of health status \nand health surveillance, public education, and emergency preparedness coordination. Nashville \nreceives funding from CDC to provide immunizations to children, conduct health screenings and \nresource navigation, and educate its residents to prevent spread of communicable diseases. \n21.  Plaintiff the City  of Kansas City (“Kansas City”) is  a municipal corporation \norganized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Missouri. Its population is \napproximately 508,090, according to 2020 Census estimates. The Kansas City Health Department \nis a city agency with about 290 employees that works to improve the health outcomes of Kansas \nCity residents through community-directed programs, services, and collaboration. Kansas City \nreceives funding from CDC to support critical public health work including to develop laboratory \ncapacity  for  infectious  disease  testing,  to  connect  vulnerable  populations  to  health  care,  to \nvaccinate uninsured adults, and to train various actors in the community on public health best \npractices. \n22.  Plaintiff  AFSCME  is  a  labor  union  representing  approximately  1.4  million \nmembers in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico in both the public and private \nsectors. AFSCME’s public employee members work for a wide array of state, county, and \nmunicipal employers, including many state and local health departments. AFSCME members who \nwork in public health rely on the grants at issue in this case to fund their positions, and cancellation \nof these grants has led directly to layoffs of AFSCME members as well as worsened working \nconditions for AFSCME members who continue to be employed in public health work. AFSCME \nbrings this suit on behalf of its state and local employee members who have been injured, as well \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 55\nas in AFSCME’s own right as an organization harmed by the loss of members due to layoffs \nstemming from the grant cuts. \n23.  Defendant Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., is the Secretary of HHS and that agency’s \nhighest-ranking official. He is charged with the direction, supervision, and management of all \ndecisions and actions of that agency and of HHS’s subordinate agencies, including CDC. See 42 \nU.S.C. § 242c(b). Plaintiffs sue him in his official capacity.  \n24.  Defendant  HHS  is  an  agency  of  the  federal  government  headquartered  in \nWashington, D.C. \n25.  Defendant Susan Monarez purports to be the Acting Director of CDC. Plaintiff sues \nher in her official capacity. Although there appears to be a serious question about whether Monarez \nis eligible to continue serving as Acting Director following the President’s nomination of her to be \nCDC Director,2 Plaintiffs name her as a defendant out of an abundance of caution but reserve the \nright to substitute an officer authorized to perform the duties of the Acting Director. Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 25(d) (providing that when a public officer “ceases to hold office,” the “officer’s successor is \nautomatically substituted as a party” and “any misnomer not affecting the parties’ substantial rights \nmust be disregarded”). \n \n2  The President named Monarez as Acting Director of CDC on January 23, 2025. His subsequent \nnomination of her to serve as Director of CDC on March 24 should render her ineligible to continue \nserving as Acting Director under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 5 U.S.C. § 3345(b). \nNonetheless, the CDC website continues to list her as Acting Director, and it has been reported \nthat official CDC communications continue to identify her as Acting Director.

Defendant CDC is an agency of the federal government and a subordinate agency \nof HHS. It is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia.  \nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS \n \nI.   Congress appropriates billions of dollars in public health funding. \n \n27.       Congress provided funding for grants-in-aid to local and state governments \nthrough the passage of several COVID-related appropriations acts, including:  \n▪  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), Pub. L. No. \n116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020); \n▪  The  Coronavirus  Response  and  Relief  Supplemental  Appropriations  Act,  2021 \n(“CRRSAA”), Pub. L. No. 116-260, 134 Stat. 1182 (2021) (Division M of a larger \nconsolidated appropriations act); \n▪  The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), Pub. L. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4 (2021); \n▪  The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, Pub. L. \nNo. 116-123, 134 Stat. 146 (2020); and \n▪  The  Paycheck  Protection  Program  and  Health  Care  Enhancement  Act  (“Paycheck \nProtection Act”), Pub. L. No. 116-139, 134 Stat. 620 (2020).  \n28.  These laws were a direct response to the outbreak and devastation of COVID-19. \nCongress sought to respond to the nationwide public health crisis and economic devastation, \npromote recovery, and ensure that the nation would be better prepared for future public health \nthreats. In addition to directing funds toward ameliorating the immediate effects of the COVID-19 \noutbreak, Congress sought to address the longer-term challenges it knew the country would face \nin COVID-19’s wake, including gaps in the public health system and the need for investment in \ncritical public health infrastructure.  \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 12 of 55\n29.  In the CARES Act, Congress appropriated $4.3 billion to Defendants “to prevent, \nprepare for, and respond to coronavirus,” requiring that: no less than $1.5 billion “shall be for \ngrants to or cooperative agreements with States, localities,” and other entities, “including to carry \nout  surveillance,  epidemiology,  laboratory  capacity,  infection  control,  mitigation, \ncommunications, and other preparedness and response activities”; and that no less than $500 \nmillion “shall be for public health data surveillance and analytics infrastructure modernization.” \nCARES Act, 134 Stat. at 554–55. The Act states that “the term ‘coronavirus’ means SARS-CoV-\n2 or another coronavirus with pandemic potential.” 134 Stat. at 614. \n30.  In the CRRSAA, Congress appropriated $8.75 billion to Defendants “to prevent, \nprepare for, and respond to coronavirus,” providing that the appropriated amounts “shall be for \nactivities to plan, prepare for, promote, distribute, administer, monitor, and track coronavirus \nvaccines to ensure broad-based distribution, access, and vaccine coverage.” 134 Stat. at 1911. \nCongress instructed that no less than $4.5 billion of that amount should go to states, localities, and \ncertain other designated entities, that at least $300 million be used “for high-risk and underserved \npopulations,  including  racial  and  ethnic  minority  populations  and  rural  communities,”  and \nspecified that funding requirements could be satisfied “by making awards through other grant or \ncooperative agreement mechanisms.” 134 Stat. at 1911–12. The CRRSAA provides that the term \n“coronavirus” “means SARS–CoV–2 or another coronavirus with pandemic potential.” 134 Stat. \nat 1185. \n31.  ARPA provided billions to HHS and CDC “to plan, prepare for, promote, distribute, \nadminister, monitor, and track COVID-19 vaccines”; “strengthen vaccine confidence in the United \nStates”; “improve rates of vaccination throughout the United States”; and “strengthen and expand \nactivities and workforce related to genomic sequencing, analytics, and disease surveillance,” \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 13 of 55\namong other objectives. 135 Stat. at 37–41. Out of that amount, and to fulfill those objectives, \nCongress required that the CDC award grants or cooperative agreements to state and local public \nhealth departments. Id. at 37, 40-42. Congress specifically appropriated funds so that HHS would \n“award grants to, or enter into cooperative agreements or contracts with, State, local, and territorial \npublic health departments to establish, expand, and sustain a public health workforce.” Id. at 41. \n32.  The Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act \nprovided $2.2 billion to CDC “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to COVID-19 domestically and \ninternationally.” Not less than $950,000,000 of the amount was required to be used for grants to \nor cooperative agreements with states and localities so that they could “carry out surveillance, \nepidemiology,  laboratory  capacity,  infection  control,  mitigation,  communications,  and  other \npreparedness and response activities.” 134 Stat. at 147.  \n33.  The Paycheck Protection Act appropriated billions to be transferred to HHS and \nCDC for states and localities to “develop, purchase, administer, process, and analyze COVID–19 \ntests, including support for workforce, epidemiology, use by employers or in other settings, scale \nup of testing by public health, academic, commercial, and hospital laboratories, and community-\nbased testing sites, health care facilities, and other entities engaged in COVID–19 testing, conduct \nsurveillance, trace contacts, and other related activities related to COVID–19 testing.” 134 Stat. at \n624.  \n34.  Congress did not limit the expenditure of the funds appropriated by these provisions \nto the duration of COVID-19’s status or designation as a “pandemic.”  \n35.  In contrast, when Congress intended to tie the availability of funds to a declaration \nof a public health emergency, it did so expressly within the laws themselves. E.g., American \nRescue Plan Act of 2021, § 9402, 135 Stat. at 127 (“during the emergency period . . . and the 1-\n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 14 of 55\nyear period immediately following the end of such emergency period”); id. § 9811(hh), 135 Stat. \nat 211–12 (“ends on the last day of the first quarter that begins one year after the last day of the \nemergency period”); CARES Act, § 1109(h), 134 Stat. at 306 (“until the date on which the national \nemergency . . . expires”). \nII.  HHS/CDC uses the money appropriated by Congress to fund grants that support Plaintiff \nLocal Governments’ critical public health projects. \n \n36.  Consistent with the Congressional mandate, Defendants used the appropriated \nfunds to offer grant awards and cooperative agreements to states and localities, including Plaintiff \nLocal Governments.       \nHarris County, Texas \n37.  Defendants awarded four grants to Harris County. Two (the Embrace HOPE Grant \nand the CHW Grant) were awarded directly to the County. Two more (the IMMU Grant and the \nIDCU Grant) came through the Texas Department of State Health Services (“Texas DSHS”), \nwhich acted as a pass-through entity for the funds. Harris County administered the projects funded \nby these grant awards through its department, Harris County Public Health. \nA.  Embrace HOPE Grant \n \n38.  On May 27, 2021, Defendants awarded the Harris Cares: Embrace HOPE (Healing, \nOpportunity, Prosperity, Equity) Grant (the “Embrace HOPE Grant”) to Plaintiff Harris County. \nThe grant provides $27,627,507 in federal funding to the county over a budget and performance \nperiod running from June 1, 2021 to May 31, 2026. On the date Defendants terminated this grant, \nover $4 million of funding remained to be distributed to Harris County. The Embrace HOPE Grant \nis funded by money that Congress appropriated through CRRSAA.  \n39.  The initial grant period for the Embrace HOPE Grant was June 1, 2021 to May 31, \n2023. On December 15, 2022, Defendants amended the notice of award to extend the end date to \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 15 of 55\nMay 31, 2024, and Harris County approved that extension on January 10, 2023. On February 22, \n2024, Defendants amended the notice of award to reflect a further extension of the end date to May \n31, 2026, and Harris County approved that extension on May 7, 2024. \n40.  Harris  County  uses  Embrace  HOPE  Grant  funds  for  projects  including:  the \nestablishment of a wastewater surveillance program, which provides critical surveillance data for \nemerging  and  infectious  diseases;  the  revitalization  and  modernization  of  epidemiologic \nsurveillance systems; data modernization and visualization; the development of community health \nworker training; enhanced workforce development; and the release and maintenance of a public \ndata  hub.  The  grant  also  supports  Harris  County  in  addressing  COVID-19-related  health \ndisparities, enabling it to prevent and control the transmission of COVID-19 and other diseases \namong high-risk and underserved populations in the County. Prior to its termination, the grant had \nenabled Harris County to test 961 wastewater samples, investigate over 8,000 reported conditions, \nand respond to 65 outbreaks in the county. \n41.  The Embrace HOPE Grant supports the work of four full-time and ten temporary \nHarris County employees, as well as thirteen vendors.  \nB.  Community Health Workers (CHW) Grant \n \n42.  On August 23, 2021, Defendants awarded the Community Health Workers for \nPublic Health Response and Resilient Communities Grant (the “CHW” grant) to Plaintiff Harris \nCounty. The CHW grant is funded with money appropriated by Congress in the CARES Act.  \n43.  The initial grant award provided $2,999,755. to Harris County for a budget and \nperformance period running from August 31, 2021, until August 30, 2024. On July 13, 2022, \nDefendants issued a second award under the CHW grant that provided an additional $2,999,755 \nto Plaintiff Harris County. On July 3, 2023, Defendants issued a third award under the CHW grant, \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 16 of 55\nproviding an additional $3,749,982 to Harris County. On July 15, 2024, Defendants issued a notice \nof award extending the grant period end date to August 30, 2025. All told, the CHW grant obligated \nDefendants to provide a total of $9,749,492 in funding to Plaintiff Harris County over a period \nextending from August 31, 2021, until August 30, 2025. \n44.  When Defendants terminated this grant, over $1 million had yet to be paid. \n45.  The CHW grant funds activities involving outreach, canvassing, and education. The \ngrant supports the training and deployment of community health workers, whose efforts address \nhealth disparities in Harris County by strengthening partnerships with community members and \norganizations. The grant directly supports a team of resource navigators who help community \nmembers sign up for public benefits programs, as well as a team that uses a data-driven approach \nto organize community events and conduct canvassing activities that reach over 40,000 Harris \nCounty residents every year. The work supported by the CHW grant prioritizes outreach to \nresidents with the greatest need for public health services in order to increase awareness and \nutilization of Harris County’s programs and services. Notably, the project title listed in the various \nnotices of award for this grant is “Before Always Has an After: Navigating Beyond the Pandemic,” \nunderscoring the fact that the availability of the grant funds was never intended to be restricted to \na narrow window based on Defendants’ opinion about COVID-19’s status as a “pandemic.” \n46.  The CHW  grant  funds the work of twelve full-time employees and nineteen \nvendors.  \nC.  Immunization (IMMU) and Infectious Disease Control Unit (IDCU) Grants \n \n47.  Defendants awarded millions of dollars in grant funding through an award titled \n“National Initiative to Address COVID-19 Health Disparities Among Populations at High-Risk \nand Underserved, Including Racial and Ethnic Minority Populations and Rural Communities.” The \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 17 of 55\nTexas  DSHS,  acting  as  a  pass-through  entity  for  the  funds  pursuant  to  42  U.S.C.  § 247b, \nsubsequently entered into two grant agreements with Harris County. The funds were appropriated \nby Congress in the CARES Act and the CRRSAA. \nThe IMMU Grant \n48.  On May 25, 2021, Harris County received $26,500,670 from Defendants (via Texas \nDSHS) through the Immunization COVID-19 Grant Program (the “IMMU Grant”). On October \n12, 2021, Texas DSHS increased the IMMU Grant award by an additional $19,347,909. In total, \nHarris County’s IMMU Grant budget was $45,848,579. The IMMU Grant is funded by money \nthat  Congress  appropriated  in  the  CARES  Act  to  expand  the  Immunization  Cooperative \nAgreement program, as well as money appropriated in the CRRSAA. When Defendants terminated \nthis grant, more than $13 million of those funds remained to be paid to Harris County. \n49.  The IMMU Grant’s funding period was initially set to run from May 26, 2021, \nthrough June 30, 2024. On May 7, 2024, Harris County and Texas DSHS extended the program’s \nend date to June 30, 2025. \n50.  The purpose of the IMMU Grant is to support vaccine administration, call center \noperations (for questions about vaccines, vaccine appointments, and vaccine-preventable diseases \nsuch as perinatal hepatitis B), data analytics and informatics, disease  and health reporting, \nimmunization-related media campaigns, and community outreach and education. The grant assists \nHarris County in reducing health disparities related to vaccine access and increasing vaccine \nuptake, including COVID-19 vaccines (including yearly boosters), particularly among populations \ndisproportionately  affected  by  the  outbreak  of  COVID-19.  This  funding  strengthens  Harris \nCounty’s immunization planning and implementation and assists it in evaluating vaccine behaviors \nand  perceptions.  The  IMMU  Grant  has  enabled  Harris  County  to  administer  7,364  mobile \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 18 of 55\nimmunizations, conduct 340 data analysis projects, investigate 1,142 reported cases of vaccine-\npreventable  diseases,  and  achieve  31  million  media  impressions  related  to  immunization \ncampaigns. \n51.  From the start, it was understood by all that the activities funded by the IMMU \nGrant were not focused exclusively on COVID-19. In the October 2021 amendment, for example, \nthe statement of work recognized that part of Harris County’s work would “focus on COVID-19, \ninfluenza, and other necessary vaccines.” This understanding continued, even after the expiration \nof the COVID-19 “public health emergency” declaration in May 2023. For instance, on August \n29, 2023, Harris County accepted an amendment to its agreement with Texas DSHS that modified \nthe statement of work to be performed under the IMMU Grant to include, inter alia, ensuring “high \nquality and safe administration of all vaccines” and “equitable distribution and administration of \nall vaccines” (emphasis added), neither excluding COVID-19 from this work nor confining the \nwork to COVID-19. \n52.  The  IMMU  Grant  funds  the  work  of  33  full-time  employees,  31  temporary \nemployees, and 25 vendors.  \nThe IDCU Grant \n53.  On August 11, 2020, Harris County accepted $1,227,447 in grant funding from \nDefendants, with the Texas DSHS acting as a pass-through entity, via the Infectious Disease \nControl Unit Grant (the “IDCU Grant”). On September 15, 2021, the grant budget was increased \nby $1,534,309. On August 6, 2024, the grant budget was further increased by $1,150,732. In all, \nthe IDCU Grant budget totaled $3,912,488. \n54.  The funding for the IDCU Grant comes from the CARES Act, and at least part of \nthe funding was distributed via CDC’s Epidemiology and Laboratory Capacity (“ELC”) program, \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 19 of 55\nwhich was established long before the COVID-19 outbreak and oversees an array of projects that \nstrengthen the ability of public health agencies to respond to, prevent, and control known and \nemerging  (or  re-emerging)  infectious  diseases.  CDC’s  ELC  Cooperative  Agreement  is  a \nmechanism that funds the nation’s state and local health departments and has funded local \nresponses to a variety of pathogens including H1N1 (swine flu), Zika, and Ebola. The program \nprovides resources to strengthen epidemiologic capacity, enhance laboratory capacity, improve \nhealth information systems, and promote cooperation among various components of public health \ndepartments. When Defendants terminated the grant, over $1 million remained to be paid to Harris \nCounty. \n55.  The IDCU Grant period was initially set to begin on August 12, 2020, and end on \nApril 20, 2022. On September 14, 2021, the end date was extended to July 31, 2023. On April 5, \n2022, an amendment to the agreement between Harris County and the Texas DSHS extended the \nend date further to July 31, 2024. Finally, on March 26, 2024, an amendment to the agreement \nbetween Harris County and Texas DSHS extended the end date to July 31, 2026.  \n56.  The  IDCU  Grant  funds  infectious  disease  surveillance,  case  intake,  and \ninvestigation (of COVID-19 and other notifiable conditions). The grant supports Harris County in \nresponding  to  the  COVID-19  outbreak  by  enhancing  case  identification,  improving  disease \nsurveillance, and strengthening specimen collection operations. This funding enables HCPH to \nconduct infectious disease case intake and investigation, including COVID-19, to mitigate the \nspread of the virus and protect public health. Through the grant, HCPH has investigated over 8,000 \nreported conditions and responded to 65 outbreaks countywide.  \n57.  As with the other grants, it was understood that the activities funded by the IDCU \nGrant would not be focused exclusively on COVID-19, and it was clear that the grant was intended \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 20 of 55\nto fund activities (both COVID- and non-COVID-related) even after the COVID-19 “public health \nemergency” declaration expired in May 2023. For example, the revised statement of work in the \nAugust  6,  2024,  amendment  provided  that  “COVID-funded  laboratory,  surveillance, \nepidemiology, and informatics personnel may work on other respiratory pathogens and syndromes \nmore broadly, in addition to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, as long as COVID-19 testing or \nsurveillance is included in the effort.” That same revised statement of work also stated that “where \nCOVID-19 is referenced, it will now include other respiratory pathogens and syndromes.”  \n58.  The IDCU Grant funds the work of four full-time employees and one vendor.  \nColumbus, Ohio \n59.  Defendant CDC, through the Ohio Department of Health, which acted as a pass-\nthrough entity for the funds, awarded the City of Columbus Enhanced Operations grant funding \nfor the City’s public health department, Columbus Public Health, and for its CelebrateOne \ninitiative, operated out of the mayor’s office. Columbus Public Health used this funding to \nstrengthen its disease response, workforce capacity, and health information systems. CelebrateOne \nused the funding, locally known as the Ohio Health Improvement Zones grant, to reduce infant \nmortality and improve maternal health in the most underserved zip code in the City of Columbus.  \n60.  Columbus  Public  Health  first  received  the  funding  award  for  the  Enhanced \nOperations grant on August 1, 2022. This first round of funding lasted through July 31, 2023. \nThen, on August 1, 2023, Columbus Public Health applied for and received additional Enhanced \nOperations funds. This initial award was for $2.1 million, to be used by July 31, 2024. Over the \ncoming year, Columbus Public Health received more than $2.7 million in additional funding along \nwith an extension of the grant period until December 31, 2025. Later, on December 24, 2024, \nColumbus Public Health received another $1.2 million in Enhanced Operations funds to use by \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 21 of 55\nthe end of 2025. In total, Columbus Public Health had over $6 million in Enhanced Operations \ngrant funding, to be spent by December 31, 2025.  \n61.  Columbus Public Health used these funds to hire disease intervention specialists, \nwho conduct infectious disease tracing, investigations, and community response coordination, and \nupgrade Columbus’s electronic health records system. Though the distribution of these grants was \nspurred by the COVID-19 pandemic, it was clear to Columbus Public Health that the money was \nnot meant to be used solely, or even largely, for purposes related to COVID-19. In fact, the funding \nwas distributed to Columbus Public Health after the end of the declared Public Health Emergency \nassociated with COVID-19. Instead, Columbus Public Health, with permission of the Ohio \nDepartment of Health, used the funding to increase their preparedness for any future pandemic or \ndisease outbreak, such as the current measles outbreak. At the time of the mass terminations, \nColumbus Public Health had more than $3 million left in Enhanced Operations funding and had \nalready planned for the money to be spent by December 31, 2025, on full-time staff, such as \nDisease Intervention Specialists, and health information system modernization.  \n62.  Columbus’s CelebrateOne initiative received Enhanced Operations federal funding \nin the form of an Ohio Health Improvement Zones grant. CelebrateOne first received an award of \n$200,000  in  July  of  2022  with  an  initial  performance  period  ending  on  May  31,  2023. \nCelebrateOne later received $156,000 in supplemental funds from CDC and an extension on the \ngrant performance period, as well as an additional no-cost extension. In total, CelebrateOne had \n$356,000 to spend by June 30, 2025. CelebrateOne used CDC funding to contract with community \npartners that provide critical services related to infant and maternal health, including lactation and \nbreastfeeding services, mental health support, and free prenatal care, among others. The Ohio \nHealth Improvement Zones grant allowed CelebrateOne to provide targeted interventions to the \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 22 of 55\n43232 zip code in Columbus, an underserved area with the highest infant mortality rate in the city. \nFamilies in this zip code previously lacked access to healthcare and other support systems that \nother communities had, but with CDC funding, CelebrateOne was able to fund service providers \nwith an intensive focus on this underserved area. At the time of the termination, CelebrateOne still \nhad $103,000 of federal funds remaining and had already contracted with community partners to \nuse these funds to pay for services through June of 2025.  \nNashville, Tennessee      \n63.  In 2021 and 2022, Defendant CDC, through the State of Tennessee, which acted as \na pass-through entity for the funds, provided Nashville with two grants related to COVID-19: the \nELC grant and the Immunization and Vaccines for Children (“VFC”) grant. \n64.   Nashville initially received $9 million in VFC funds and later  amended and \nrenewed the grant contract for over $4.3 million effective July 2023 through June 30, 2026. The \ncontract included supplemental COVID vaccination funding to support vaccines for children. The \nVFC funding enabled the creation of Nashville’s mobile health unit, or “strike team,” which was \nvery effective in reaching communities hardest hit by the COVID-19 epidemic. The strike team \ndiscovered and addressed issues beyond the pandemic, including barriers to enrollment to public \nschool due to lack of health services.  \n65.  Nashville received approximately $26 million in ELC funding, including a renewal \nfor $8.3 million that was meant to last for a grant period of July 1, 2023, through July 31, 2026. \nThis grant provided significant COVID-19 response funding, for contact tracing, laboratory costs, \nand testing. In partnership with 85 community organizations, Nashville distributed COVID-19 and \nflu combination tests to residents to help prevent the spread of illness. The ELC grant also provided \nfunding to address homelessness issues, particularly at the height of the pandemic.  \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 23 of 55\n66.  In 2021, Nashville applied for and was awarded a total of $3 million through the \nCHW grant from Defendant CDC. The grant agreement has changed over time, but generally \nNashville used the funds to provide COVID-19- related services, testing, contact tracing and \nimmunizations, particularly in high-risk communities. Nashville had been using the CHW grant to \nfund health screening and resource navigation across five health clinics in the county in partnership \nwith two trusted community partners. It has also planned to incorporate resource navigation and \nhealth screening into its homeless services. \nKansas City, Missouri \n67.  Defendant CDC awarded four total grants to Kansas City in connection with \nCOVID-19. One was awarded directly to Kansas City: the National Initiative to Address COVID-\n19 Health Disparities Among Populations at High-Risk and Underserved, Including Racial and \nEthnic Minority Populations and Rural Communities (“Health Disparities”) grant. Three were \nawarded through the State of Missouri, which acted as a pass-through entity for the funds, provided \nKansas City with three grants related to the COVID-19 pandemic: the ELC-ED Epidemiology & \nLaboratory Capacity Enhancing Detection Expansion (“ELC-ED”) grant, the CHW grant, and the \nCOVID-19 Adult Vaccination Supplemental (“AVS”) grant.  \n68.  The ELC-ED grant was first awarded in 2021 and set to expire in June of 2023. \nHowever, it was later renewed through July 31, 2025, with a total grant amount of $3.8 million. \nKansas City used the ELC-ED grant as part of a multi-year project to develop capacity to test for \ninfectious diseases like COVID-19, influenza, and measles at the city level, rather than relying on \ncounty facilities. Kansas City presently does not have the capacity to run these tests, and has to \nsend results to the state government in Jefferson City which delays time for test results. Pursuant \nto this project, Kansas City used ELC-ED funds to train staff on testing procedures and to undergo \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 24 of 55\na certification process for its facilities. It was at the final step of purchasing lab equipment for its \nfacilities when the ELC-ED grant was cancelled.  \n69.  The CHW grant awarded Kansas City $607,200 in 2023, and it was renewed for \nanother $607,200 in 2024 for a grant period ending in June 2025. The City used CHW funds to \nhire community navigators to screen residents of public housing complexes for common untreated \nhealth issues, such as high blood pressure, and connect them with access to health care.  \n70.  The AVS grant funded vaccinations for uninsured adults. The funding was initially \nused primarily for COVID-19 vaccinations, but more recently Kansas City used it to administer \nother vaccinations, such as the Hepatitis B vaccination. \n71.  In 2021, Kansas City applied for and received $3,674,514 from Defendant CDC \nthrough the Health Disparities grant. It was originally scheduled to end May 31, 2023, but was \nultimately  extended  until  May  31,  2025.  Kansas  City  used  this  grant  to  train  workplaces, \ncommunity-based organizations, and other entities on best practices to avoid the spread of illness, \nincluding how to use personal protective equipment. Funding also supported public education on \nvaccinations, including the importance of the COVID-19 vaccine and the measles vaccine.  \nAFSCME Members \n72.  AFSCME and its members around the country have felt the brunt of these grant \ncancellations in various ways: layoffs and terminations from employment, reshuffling into new \njobs,  and  more.  These  include  not  only  AFSCME-represented  employees  who  have  been \nterminated from their jobs working for Plaintiff City of Columbus’ Public Health Department, but \nalso  numerous  state  and  local  employees  represented  by  AFSCME  in  other  states  and \nmunicipalities. \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 25 of 55\n73.  For example, the State of Alaska received a number of HHS COVID-era grants, \nvalued at $172 million. One, worth $40 million, funded the immunization and vaccination of \nchildren. Another provided $96 million to improve epidemiology laboratories in the state that work \nto control the spread of infectious diseases. Alaska also applied for and received an award under \nthe  Health  Disparities  grant.  The  Alaska  State  Department  of  Health  used  these  grants  to \nadminister programs for improving public health access and increasing laboratory capacity for \nmonitoring disease rates, and to hire employees to create and distribute public health programming \nrelated to vaccination. Much of the CDC funding used by the Alaska State Department of Health \nwas set to expire in 2027. However, due to the early termination of this funding, 23 employees \nrepresented by AFSCME at the Alaska State Department of Health were laid off. Some of these \nemployees were moved to new positions within the department that they had not applied for or \nsought, while others were terminated from employment entirely. \n74.  Another example: Jackson County, Ohio also received Enhanced Operations funds \nfrom CDC, through the Ohio Department of Health. Jackson County Health Department received \nthe CHW grant on August 31, 2021, totaling $4.4 million. This funding was scheduled to expire \non August 30, 2025. Over the past four years, this funding was used to hire community health \nworkers  who  engaged  in  public  health  outreach,  vaccination,  and  pairing  individuals  with \nhealthcare providers in counties across Ohio. Although the funding was initially allocated during \nthe height of the COVID-19 pandemic, its purpose was to bolster community resilience generally \nfor public health emergencies, not limited to COVID-19. When this funding was cut by HHS, three \nAFSCME members were laid off and are currently out of work receiving no pay.  \n \n \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 26 of 55\nIII.      Congress and Defendants continue funding the grants, even after the COVID-19 \n“public health emergency” declaration expires in May 2023. \n \n75.  On  May  11,  2023, the  HHS  Secretary’s  final  extension  of  the  public  health \nemergency declaration pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 247d expired. However, the effects of the COVID-\n19 pandemic continued, as did Congress’s desire to promote public health measures related to \nCOVID and pandemics generally, as well as preparations for future public health outbreaks and \ncrises. \n76.  Subsequent  Congressional  action  reaffirmed  what  was  already  clear:  that  the \nfunding provided by the COVID-19-related appropriations laws was to remain available regardless \nof COVID-19’s continuing status as a “pandemic” or as a declared “public health emergency.”  In \nearly June 2023, shortly after the expiration of the public health emergency declaration, Congress \ncanceled $27 billion in related appropriations through the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. \nL. No. 118-5, Div. B, 137 Stat. 10, 23 (June 3, 2023). In that Act, Congress reviewed various \nCOVID-related laws and rescinded those funds that it determined were no longer necessary. Id., \nDiv. B §§ 1–81. Congress chose not to rescind the funding for the grants at issue in this case. \n77.  Defendants implicitly acknowledged that the funding for these grants remains \navailable even after the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration expired in May 2023. \nDefendants never attempted to terminate the grants until March 2025 and continued to affirm their \nsupport of the programs funded by the grants. For example, Defendants extended a number of \nPlaintiff Harris County grants’ end dates. In February 2024, Defendants extended Embrace HOPE \ngrant’s end date to May 2026. Defendants granted an additional $3.7 million in funding for the \nCHW Grant in July 2023, and in July 2024 they extended the grant period to August 2025.  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 27 of 55\nIV.    Defendants suddenly eliminate COVID-19-related grant programs and  terminate \nPlaintiff Local Governments’ grant funding. \n \nA.  Defendants eliminate public health funding through a mass purge of “COVID-\nrelated” CDC grants. \n \n78.  On March 24, 2025, in connection with the Mass Termination Decision, Defendants \nterminated approximately $11.4 billion in CDC grants to states, localities, and other entities. \nPlaintiff Local Governments’ grants were among those terminated.  \n79.  The terminations are nationwide in scope, have a massive financial impact, and \nwere abruptly implemented. Defendants did not engage in any individualized consideration of the \naffected grants. Instead, Defendants apparently deemed the CDC grant programs to be “COVID-\nrelated” and designated them for immediate elimination based on one criterion: their funding \nderived from COVID-era appropriations acts passed by Congress. \n80.  On March 25, 2025, HHS Director of Communications Andrew Nixon issued a \npublic statement confirming that the terminations were all based on the single Mass Termination \nDecision. The statement read: “The COVID-19 pandemic is over, and HHS will no longer waste \nbillions of taxpayer dollars responding to a non-existent pandemic that Americans moved on from \nyears ago. HHS is prioritizing funding projects that will deliver on President Trump’s mandate to \naddress our chronic disease epidemic and Make America Healthy Again.” Zadrozny, CDC is \npulling  back  $11B  in  Covid  funding  sent  to  health  departments  across  the  U.S., \nhttps://perma.cc/35SS-V2WE. The statement’s reference to Defendants’ “prioritizing funding \n[alternative] projects” suggests that Defendants intend to use the money that was appropriated for \nthe terminated grants for other purposes, in contravention of Congress’ appropriations. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 28 of 55\n81.  On  March  29,  2025,  a  spreadsheet  was  uploaded  to  the  HHS  website  titled \n“HHS_Grants_Terminated.”3 The document identifies over a thousand grants terminated by HHS, \nincluding those that were part of the mass termination of CDC grants on March 24. The spreadsheet \nlists detailed information for each grant. The last two columns are labeled “Presidential Action” \nand “For Cause (Put X if applicable).” Notably, only one of the grants listed is identified as having \nbeen terminated “For Cause,” and it was not a CDC grant terminated in accordance with the Mass \nTermination Decision. All of the CDC grants in the document list “N/A - Departmental Authority” \nunder “Presidential Action.” The government has continued to update this list through the date of \nfiling of this complaint. All of the CDC grants in the document continue to be designated “N/A – \nDepartmental Authority” instead of “for cause.” \n82.  The Mass Termination Decision, and Defendants’ implementation of that decision, \ninflicted massive disruption upon grant recipients and hampered critical public health work. The \ngrant terminations were effective immediately, and Defendants gave no prior notice or advance \nwarning to grantees of their decision, which deprived Plaintiff Local Governments and others of \nthe opportunity to plan for a huge loss of funding. \n83.  Defendants’  Mass  Termination  Decision  did  not  entail  any  particularized \nconsideration of the targeted grants, let alone reasoned evaluation of the permissible grounds for \nterminating the grants. As already noted, none of the CDC grants that Defendants terminated are \nidentified in the HHS spreadsheet as having been terminated “for cause.” And, as demonstrated by \nthe notices of termination received by Plaintiff Local Governments, and by public reporting, \n \n3 The version of the document uploaded on March 29, 2025 is located at https://perma.cc/V73X-\nRP5J. The government continues to update this list at \nhttps://taggs.hhs.gov/Content/Data/HHS_Grants_Terminated.pdf.  \n \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 29 of 55\nDefendants recited essentially the same boilerplate reason for terminating all the grants. “The CDC \nreviewed a list of HHS-provided Covid grants and cooperative agreements and identified the \nprograms that were no longer needed.” Zadrozny, CDC is pulling back $11B in Covid funding sent \nto health departments across the U.S., https://perma.cc/35SS-V2WE. \nB.  Defendants implement the Mass Termination Decision and notify Plaintiff Local \nGovernments of the termination of their grants. \n \n84.  Defendants’ terminations of Plaintiff Local Governments’ grants resulted directly \nfrom  the  implementation  of  the  Mass  Termination  Decision.  Because  Plaintiff  Local \nGovernments’  grants  were  funded  by  money  appropriated  by  Congress  in  COVID-related \nappropriations laws, including the CARES Act and the CRRSAA, Defendants marked them for \nelimination, without any consideration of whether termination was permissible or warranted.  \n85.  On March 25, 2025, Plaintiff Harris County received notice that Defendants had \nterminated the Embrace HOPE Grant, effective immediately. The amended notice of award stated \nin relevant part: \nTermination: The purpose of this amendment is to terminate this award which is funded \n  by COVID-19 supplemental appropriations. The termination of this award is for cause. \n  HHS regulations permit termination if “the non-Federal entity fails to comply with the \n  terms and conditions of the award”, or separately, “for cause.” The end of the pandemic \n  provides cause to terminate COVID-related grants and cooperative agreements. These \n  grants and cooperative agreements were issued for a limited purpose: to ameliorate the \n  effects of the pandemic. Now that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative  \nagreements are no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out. Termination of \n  this award is effective as of the date set out in your Notice of Award.  \n \nNo additional activities can be conducted, and no additional costs may be incurred.  \nUnobligated award balances will be de-obligated by CDC.  \n \nThe termination notice forbids the grantee from performing compensable work after the date \nindicated. \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 30 of 55\n86.  On March 25, 2025,  Harris County received notice that Defendants had terminated \nthe CHW Grant. The amended notice of award contained a termination provision with language \nidentical to that contained in the Embrace HOPE Grant termination. It, too, listed an effective \ntermination date of March 24, 2025.  \n87.  On March 25, 2025, the Texas DSHS notified Harris County that Defendants had \nterminated the IMMU and IDCU Grants. Texas DSHS wrote that it was “issuing this notice to \npause all activities immediately” because it had been “notified that the federal grant funding for \nImmunization/COVID  Epidemiology  Laboratory  Capacity  (ELC/COVID),  and  Health \nDisparities/COVID, is terminated as of March 24, 2025.”  \n88.  The termination notices for the Embrace HOPE and CHW Grants also contain the \nfollowing directive requiring complete closeout within 30 days: \nCloseout: In order to facilitate an orderly closeout, we are requesting that you \nsubmit all closeout reports identified below within thirty (30) days of the date of \nthis  NoA.  Submit  the  documentation  as  a  “Grant  Closeout”  amendment  in \nGrantSolutions. The reporting timeframe is the full period of performance. Please \nnote, if you fail to submit timely and accurate reports, CDC may also pursue other \nenforcement actions per 45 CFR Part  75.371. \n \nThe regulations, however, provide 90 days for closeout. See 45 C.F.R. § 75.381. \n89.  On March 26, 2025, Columbus Public Health received email notice that CDC was \nterminating its Enhanced Operations grant more than eight months early. Columbus Public Health \nwas informed that “[o]n March 25, 2025, Ohio Department of Health (ODH) staff were notified \nthrough revised Notices of Award placed in the [grant] portal that” the Enhanced Operations grant \nwas “revised to change the period of performance end date to March 24, 2025.”  The notice \nindicated that the Ohio Department of Health had been given less than 30 days to submit its \ncloseout report and thus Columbus Public Health would need to prepare and submit its final \npaperwork by April 4, 2025. \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 31 of 55\n90.  On  March  25,  2025,  CelebrateOne  received  an  email  notice  from  the  Ohio \nDepartment of Health, notifying it that the federal government had unilaterally terminated several \nCDC grants to the state, and that the Ohio Health Improvement Zones funding was included in \nthose terminations. CelebrateOne was told that the grant had been cancelled as of the previous day, \nMarch 24th, and that, due to the premature cancellations, the Ohio Department of Health could not \ncompensate contractors for any work completed after March 24, 2025.  \n91.  Similarly, on March 25, 2025, Nashville received an amended “Notice of Award” \nfrom CDC dated March 24, 2025, terminating its CHW grant for cause. The termination language \nin the notice was identical to that received by Harris County. \n92.   Nashville also received a short memorandum dated March 25, 2025, from the State \nof Tennessee that both of its passthrough grants, ELC and VFC, were terminated effective March \n24, 2025. According to the memorandum, “[d]ue to [a] decision by the federal government, the \nfunding source for [Nashville’s] services ha[d] been eliminated.”  The Tennessee Department of \nHealth acknowledged that this was an “abrupt shift in plans” and reiterated that this was solely \n“due  to  the  decision  to  engage  in  an  immediate  termination  of  funding  from  the  federal \ngovernment.”  Nashville was instructed to stop all activities related to these grants and to submit \nall invoices by Friday, April 11, 2025.  \n93.  On March 25, 2025, Kansas City heard from colleagues in other cities that CDC \nfunding had been terminated and checked the federal grant portal for status, only to locate the \nnotice of termination. The notice was effective the previous day, March 24, and indicated that their \nHealth  Disparities  grant  was  terminated  “for  cause”  with  the  cause  being  “the  end  of  the \npandemic.” The termination language in the notice was identical to that received by Harris County \nand Nashville and reproduced above.  \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 32 of 55\n94.  On March 25, 2025, Kansas City also received communications from the Missouri \nDepartment of Health and Senior Services similarly notifying them that their CHW and AVS \ngrants had been terminated, and on March 28, Kansas City received a letter indicating the same \nregarding the ELC-ED grant. The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services had not \nreceived advance notice of the CDC grant terminations and stated in its communications to Kansas \nCity that it was “not clear if additional awards will be terminated in the future.” The Department \nacknowledged that the “unexpected termination of awards by CDC leaves the department and \n[their] valued partners in a very difficult situation,” and thanked Kansas City for its “partnership \nand understanding.”  \nC.  Defendants also notify other public health employers of AFSCME members of the \nterminations of their grants.  \n \n95.  AFSCME represents public employees affected by these grant terminations at state \nand local governments around the country, in addition to those at Plaintiff City of Columbus. To \ntake just one example of an affected local government employer of AFSCME members, on March \n24, 2025, Jackson County,  Ohio’s “Community Health Workers for  COVID Response and \nResilient Communities” (CCR) grant was terminated. This grant was worth $4 million.  \n96.  To take one example of a state government employer of AFSCME members, on \nMarch 24, 2025, the Alaska Department of Health was notified that the following CDC grants, \noriginally awarded to it during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be terminated: the ELC grant, the \nVFC grant, and the Health Disparities grant. These grants allocated $172 million to the State of \nAlaska. \nD.  Defendants did not terminate the grants “for cause.” \n \n97.  Defendants stated that “the end of the [COVID-19] pandemic” constituted “cause.”  \nDefendants  do  not  identify  any  authority  in  support  of  the  Mass  Termination  Decision. \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 33 of 55\nTermination  notices  allude  vaguely,  without  citation,  to  “HHS  regulations.”  45  C.F.R. \n§ 75.372(a)(2)4 does permit for cause termination, but Defendants did not cite this regulation as \ntheir basis for termination. Nor could they: the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency \ndoes not satisfy it.  \n98.  Nothing  in  5  C.F.R.  § 75.372(a)(2)’s  text,  history,  or  interpretation  supports \nDefendants’  assertion  that  the  “end  of  the  [COVID-19]  pandemic”  supports  a  “for  cause” \ntermination. When HHS has examined what “for cause” means in the past, it has explained that it \ngenerally involves noncompliance of the grantee. Even though Plaintiff Local Governments were \nin compliance, Defendants’ apparent classification of their grant terminations as being “for cause” \nlikely triggers the requirement that “the HHS awarding agency must report the termination to the \nOMB-designated integrity and performance system” pursuant to 45 C.F.R. § 75.372(b). Grantees \nmay also have requirements to report compliance to their respective states. Nashville, for example, \nis required to certify to the State of Tennessee that it has “not within a three (3) year period \npreceding… had one or more public transactions (federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or \ndefault.” A failure to so certify may make Nashville less competitive for future grant awards. \nDefendants’  baseless  and  illegal  Mass  Termination  Decision  thus  has  serious  potential \nconsequences for future grant-funding opportunities. \n99.  Defendants’ stated reason for the Mass Termination Decision—the claim that the \nCOVID-19 pandemic is “over” and that “COVID-related grants and cooperative agreements” are \ntherefore  “no  longer  necessary”—is  a  policy  disagreement  with  Congress.  That  such  a \n \n4 45 C.F.R. § 75.372(a)(2) lists four grounds for terminating a grant: (1) if the grantee “fails to \ncomply with the terms and conditions of the award”; (2) “for cause”; (3) “with the consent of” the \ngrantee; and (4) by the grantee. 45 C.F.R. § 75.372(a). Defendants did not invoke any of the other \ngrounds, and none applies to Plaintiff Local Governments.  \n \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 34 of 55\ndisagreement is not a “for cause” basis for terminating grants is underscored by Defendants’ grant \ntermination spreadsheet, which indicates that these grants were terminated based on “Departmental \nAuthority,” and not “for cause.”  \nV.  Defendants’ elimination of COVID-19-related grant programs—and the resultant \nterminations of grants—has caused, and will continue to cause, immediate and \nirreparable harm to Plaintiffs. \n \n100.   Defendants’ immediate and unlawful termination of millions of dollars in grant \nfunding that provides critical support to Plaintiff Local Governments’ vital public health programs \nis causing, and will continue to cause, significant and irreparable harm to Plaintiffs. For years, \nPlaintiff Local Governments have operated their programs in reliance on the fact that, as long as \nthey complied with the terms and conditions of the grants, they would receive the promised funds \nfor the time periods stated in the awards.  \n101.  The  sudden  loss  of  these  funds  creates  immediate  harm  to  Plaintiff  Local \nGovernments’ crucial public health projects. It threatens Plaintiff Local Governments’ ability to \nprotect the health of their residents and makes Plaintiff Local Governments vulnerable to imminent \npublic health threats like the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas and elsewhere across the country. \nSee Doe 1 v. Perkiomen Valley Sch. Dist., 585 F. Supp. 3d 668, 702 (E.D. Pa. 2022) (“An increased \nrisk of contracting a life-threatening disease like COVID-19 easily constitutes an irreparable \ninjury.”). \n102.  Defendants’ classification of Plaintiff Local Governments’ grants as having been \nterminated “for cause” will likely have an adverse impact on consideration of Plaintiff Local \nGovernments’ applications for future federal funding opportunities. \n103.  In addition, the terminations are imposing immediate and irreparable constitutional \nharms on Plaintiffs. Cnty. of Santa Clara v. Trump, 250 F. Supp. 3d 497, 537 (N.D. Cal. 2017) \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 35 of 55\n(recognizing irreparable harm in the form of constitutional injury due to violation of the separation \nof powers doctrine and deprivation of Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights).  \n104.  It is also unclear whether the appropriated funds will remain available. Defendants’ \npublic statements have indicated that the funds will be used for other purposes, likely making their \nrecovery impossible. \n105.  Plaintiff Local Governments are not named plaintiffs in Colorado v. HHS, No. \n1:25-cv-121 (D.R.I. complaint filed Apr. 1, 2025), and they have not received any relief from the \ninjunctions  entered and in that case, id. (TRO entered Apr. 5, 2025, ECF No. 54; motion for \npreliminary injunction filed Apr. 8, 2025, ECF No. 60). As to the members of Plaintiff AFSCME, \nwhile AFSCME members in states covered by the Colorado litigation have seen some benefit from \nthat case in those states—for example, AFSCME members in Washington State who had been told \nthey would be laid off have since been informed those layoffs are paused as a result of the \nlitigation—AFSCME members outside the covered states continue to be harmed, including but not \nlimited to the AFSCME members terminated by Plaintiff City of Columbus’s Public Health \nDepartment, and only an order in this case can provide the funds necessary to redress those \nAFSCME members’ harms.  \nHarris County, Texas      \n106.  Defendants’  termination  of  Plaintiff  Harris  County’s  Embrace  HOPE  Grant \nthreatens to drastically decrease the County’s disease surveillance capacity, which will undercut \nits ability to rapidly detect emerging diseases and outbreaks and develop timely public health \ninterventions to safeguard the health and well-being of Harris County residents. This will lead to \nslower  public  health  response  and  interventions  (vaccine  distribution,  outreach,  awareness \ncampaigns, etc.) to prevent the spread of communicable diseases and ensure the safety of county \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 36 of 55\nresidents. Without funding, Harris County’s wastewater surveillance program will cease in its \nentirety.  \n107.  Beginning in late January 2025, Texas began to see a deadly outbreak of measles. \nHundreds of cases have been identified, with many resulting in hospitalization. Two school-aged \nchildren who lived in Texas have died. Measles is a highly contagious disease, and cases of measles \nhave recently been detected in Harris County. Losing the ability to perform wastewater monitoring \nwill diminish Harris County’s ability to respond effectively to this public health crisis. \n108.  The  terminated  grant  funding  has  also  enabled  Harris  County  to  conduct \nepidemiological and surveillance activities for over 80 notifiable disease conditions, including \nmeasles, outbreaks of sexually transmitted infections, mpox, Zika, and tuberculosis. It is especially \nimportant that Harris County continue to be able to monitor and respond to outbreaks of these \ndiseases due to the county’s large population and status as an international and domestic travel \nhub. \n109.  Defendants’ termination of Harris County’s CHW Grant will also directly impair \nthe County’s community outreach efforts, including the HCPH Connect and Outreach Programs. \nThrough the HCPH Connect program, Harris County deploys a team of state-certified resource \nnavigators who provide vulnerable county residents with both over-the-phone and in-person, one-\non-one assistance in applying for federal, state, and local benefit programs including: SNAP food \nbenefits;  WIC  program;  TANF  cash  help;  various  healthcare  benefits  including  Medicaid, \nMedicare Savings Program, and CHIP to help residents pay for medical bills and medications; the \nHealthy Texas Women program, which helps individuals pay for health exams, screenings, and \nfamily planning services; and the Harris Health System’s Financial Assistance Program, which \nprovides financial assistance for medical care for low-income county residents who have no other \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 37 of 55\npublic or private health care benefits. HCPH Connect also secures linkages to additional resources \nand service providers for community members’ needs. Without funding, the HCPH Connect \nprogram will no longer be able to operate due to the loss of staff and the team and will not be able \nto support residents, adversely affecting nearly 2,000 community members who apply for state and \nfederal benefits annually.  \n110.  The  HCPH  Outreach  Team  consists  of  CHWs  who  engage  with  community \nmembers in many important ways. Through community events, they partner with businesses and \norganizations to engage in public spaces such as grocery stores, bakeries, flea markets, health fairs, \nfood distribution sites, schools, clinics, and universities. They also distribute “care kits” that \ncontain up-to-date information in both English and Spanish on COVID-19, Mpox, other HCPH \nprograms, and additional community resources. They provide in-person and virtual presentations \nin English and Spanish, engage in community canvassing and phone calls, publish a bi-monthly \nnewsletter, and run conferences, workshops, and internships. Without these grants, the number of \nevents the Outreach team can sustain and support will be reduced, ultimately lowering the overall \nnumber of community members they can see each year. In turn, this will lead to negative public \nhealth outcomes, including the potential spread of highly contagious diseases. \n111.  Defendants’ termination of Harris County’s IMMU Grant threatens to significantly \nreduce Harris County’s vaccination outreach activities. This will decrease vaccine access for many \nvulnerable  populations  in  Harris  County,  including  children,  elderly  community  members, \nindividuals with compromised immune systems, and individuals with chronic conditions. Harris \nCounty’s disease helpline (call center) will have significantly reduced ability to offer necessary \nservices to the community and support broad services across HCPH, including scheduling clinic \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 38 of 55\nand vaccines appointments, providing disease guidance, and supporting community needs during \ndisasters.  \n112.  Defendants’ termination of the IDCU Grant reduces Plaintiff’s ability to rapidly \ndetect emerging diseases and outbreaks across Harris County. This will lead to slower public health \nresponses and interventions (vaccination distribution, outreach, and awareness campaigns, etc.) to \nprevent  the  spread  of  communicable  diseases  and  ensure  the  safety  of  the  county’s \nresidents. Defendant’s termination of the Embrace HOPE Grant exacerbates these effects. \n113.  The terminations create severe and immediate budget uncertainty for Harris County \nand interfere with the county’s ability to budget and plan for the future and to properly serve \nresidents. Cnty. of Santa Clara, 250 F. Supp. 3d at 508, 537 (recognizing immediate, irreparable \nharm due to order that created “budget uncertainty by threatening to deprive the Counties of \nhundreds of millions of dollars in federal grants that support core services in their jurisdictions” \nand explaining that this “uncertainty interferes with the Counties’ ability to budget, plan for the \nfuture, and properly serve their residents” and that counties’ need to “take steps to mitigate the risk \nof losing millions of dollars in federal funding, which will include placing funds in reserve and \nmaking cuts to services . . . will cause the Counties irreparable harm”).  \n114.  The terminations are requiring Harris County to divert its limited resources to \nimmediately respond to the chaos created by Defendants’ actions; they are likely to result in the \nloss of dozens of grant-funded employees; and they threaten imminent and irreparable injury to \nPlaintiff’s reputation and goodwill among adversely affected employees, residents who lose access \nto vital health services, and vendors providing goods and services in support of grant-funded work.      \n \n \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 39 of 55\nColumbus, Ohio \n115.  Due to the grant terminations, Columbus Public Health was forced to terminate, \ndue to lack of funding, eleven employees working in infectious disease investigations: nine disease \ninvestigation specialists and two office assistants. These critical staff members were hard at work \nprotecting the community from measles and other infectious disease outbreaks. Without them, \nColumbus Public Health has only one disease investigation specialist left. These layoffs have \nsignificantly weakened Columbus Public Health’s ability to conduct disease investigation and \nmitigation during an active measles outbreak in the state of Ohio. Additionally, Columbus Public \nHealth has also been forced to cover the expenses of six additional staff members, previously \nlargely funded with CDC dollars, through its general fund, pulling funding away from other \nimportant operational and service budgets.  \n116.  Without the previously awarded CDC funds, Columbus Public Health will also no \nlonger be able to modernize its health information system. Columbus Public Health is currently \nusing an electronic health information system different and more out of date than that of most \nhospitals and health centers. This makes it difficult for Columbus Public Health clients to access \nmedical records regarding care received at city-run clinics when they travel or visit other providers. \nWithout centralized electronic health records, patients that turn to a new hospital or clinic for \nurgent medical care may struggle to receive efficient and effective care because their providers \ncannot access up to date health information including allergies and prior existing health conditions. \nWithout the Enhanced Operations funding, Columbus Public Health cannot upgrade to a modern \nrecord-keeping system that allows for providers to easily share critical health and treatment \ninformation between different clinics and hospitals.  \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 40 of 55\n117.  Similarly, parents and children in Columbus’s most underserved neighborhood will \nsuffer due to the early termination of CelebrateOne’s federal grant. CelebrateOne used Enhanced \nOperations funding to target critical healthcare and other services to a community that faced \nsignificant barriers in accessing prenatal and infant care and had the highest infant mortality rate \nin the city. Without Enhanced Operations grant funding, CelebrateOne will be unable to offer \nimportant and effective interventions that are proven to lower infant mortality, and families in the \nneighborhood will be left without sufficient services and care. \n118.  AFSCME members have been terminated due to the grant terminations. Eleven \nbargaining unit employees of Columbus Public Health represented by AFSCME, including three \nAFSCME members, were terminated effective May 2, 2025. Columbus Public Health has agreed \nthat it will prioritize these employees to fill vacancies as funding permits. Without the grant funds \npreviously  allocated  to  Columbus  Public  Health,  these  AFSCME  members  are  without \nemployment and pay, and can only hope to be reinstated to their previous jobs if funding returns. \nNashville, Tennessee      \n119.  As a result of the loss of ELC and VFC grant funds, Nashville has had to lay off \nthree employees and have had several programs disrupted.  \n120.  One employee funded through the ELC grant managed COVID and flu testing in \npartnership with 85 organizations was let go, and the loss of funding has forced an end to the \nprogram. This means that thousands of tests will not be distributed through trusted community \ngroups and at-risk populations in Nashville will have less protection against COVID-19.  \n121.  Nashville’s mobile health unit, which the VFC helped create during COVID, will \nnow have less reach than planned—both because the team is no longer able to purchase the vehicle \nthey planned to use as a mobile medical unit, but also because they had to quickly find alternate \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 41 of 55\nfunding for the staff under the grant. At this juncture, the new funding tied to staff means that they \nwill no longer be able to attend certain community gatherings they had previously served or \nprovide services to children outside of the public school system. This budget disruption could \nmean a decrease in services elsewhere a result of the budget adjustments, including the school \nnursing program.  \n122.  Nashville Public Health lost funding for sixteen full time positions as a result of the \ntermination of its CHW grant.  \n123.  Nashville conducted much of the work for this grant through two local clinics, so \nin addition to losing its own staff, the community health clinic partners are also harmed by \nNashville’s inability to continue to provide funding for their staff.  \n124.  The staff under the CHW grant conducted health and resource barrier screenings \nacross the city—providing hundreds of resource navigations and screenings a year, and all of these \nefforts are now stymied. \n125.  Nashville also had a homelessness services project that they had already begun to \nlaunch—including advertising six open positions—that can no longer move forward. These \npositions would have provided essential resource navigation and health screening for the unhoused \npopulation in Nashville.  \n126.  In the grant awards process, the State of Tennessee requires Nashville to certify that \nthey “have not within a three (3) year period preceding… had one or more public transactions \n(federal, state, or local) terminated for cause or default.” Because the CHW grant termination \ndesignates the termination as “for cause”, Nashville can no longer certify to this effect and will \nhave to include an addendum for the next three years to explain this termination. \n \n \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 42 of 55\n \nKansas City, Missouri \n127.       Without its ELC-ED funding, Kansas City’s plan to test for infectious diseases \nat the city level have been frustrated. It already used funds to train staff on testing and obtain \nrequired certifications for the labs. Kansas City needed only to complete the purchase of the actual \nlab equipment, which it planned to do before the June 30, 2025 expiration of the funds. Now it \ncannot purchase this equipment, which renders useless its significant prior work on this project. \n128.  Kansas City has also lost funding for its adult vaccination program due to the loss \nof the AVS grant. This program offered vaccinations to protect against a variety of serious \nillnesses, such as Hepatitis B.  \n129.  Kansas  City  is  further  unable  to  expand  its  successful  community  navigator \nprogram, which was funded by the CHW grant. Because of the program’s success in improving \naccess to preventative health care, Kansas City successfully applied for other funding to grow the \nprogram, but that additional funding is now merely keeping the existing program afloat.  \n130.  Finally, Kansas City has also been forced to cancel its public health education \nprograms, funded by the Health Disparities grant, that trained workplaces on avoiding the spread \nof illnesses. The reduction and cancellation of these programs make Kansas City more vulnerable \nto the spread of any infectious disease.  \nAFSCME Members at Non-Plaintiff Public Health Employers  \n131.   AFSCME members employed in public health by state and local governments \nother than the Plaintiff Local Governments are also being irreparably harmed. For example, as a \nresult of its loss of federal funding from the grants at issue in this case, Jackson County Health \nDistrict laid off three grant-funded employees and AFSCME members, effective on April 18, \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 43 of 55\n2025. These employees were Community Health Workers who engaged in public health outreach \nto improve community resilience to public health emergencies. The loss of funding has resulted in \nthree AFSCME members’ loss of employment and pay in Jackson County. \n132.  To take a state government example, due to its loss of over $50 million in unspent \nfederal grant funding at issue in this case, the Alaska State Department of Public Health has laid \noff AFSCME-represented employees across the state of Alaska, including in Anchorage, Juneau, \nand Wasilla. Twenty-three of these employees were members of AFSCME. Sixteen of these \nAFSCME members have lost their jobs entirely, with their last day of working having been April \n4,  2025.  These  employees  included  Public  Health  Specialists,  Nurse  Consultants,  Program \nCoordinators, Research Analysts, and Administrative Assistants; they have lost their jobs, their \nbenefits including health insurance, and their ability to perform the meaningful public health \nservice to which they had dedicated their lives. The other seven AFSCME members were given \nthe option to be reassigned to other positions they had not applied for or requested, and all seven \nwere reassigned, forcing them to lose the employment they initially applied for and work in \nunfamiliar  and  less  favorable  jobs  moving  forward.AFSCME  as  an  organization  is  also \nexperiencing irreparable harm through the loss of its members’ public health employment. The \ngreatest loss to the union from the loss of these members is the loss of seeing colleagues and fellow \npublic servants out of work and unable to help the communities they love, but there are other \npractical harms to the union as an organization as well: lost dues revenue that the union relies upon \nto perform its critical representational work and, due to the resulting loss in size to its bargaining \nunits, reduced strength at the bargaining table where it negotiates wages, benefits, and other erms \nand conditions of employment for these public servants. \n \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 44 of 55\n \nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCount I \nU.S. Constitution – Separation of Powers \n(Against Defendants Kennedy and Monarez) \n \n133.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n134.  The federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong v. Exceptional Child Ctr., Inc., \n575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015).  \n135.  The Constitution separates the powers of the federal government “into three defined \ncategories, Legislative, Executive, and Judicial.” Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 721 (1986) \n(quoting INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951 (1983)). The purpose of the constitutional separation \nof powers is to “diffus[e] power the better to secure liberty.” Id. (quoting Youngstown Sheet & \nTube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring)). \n136.  The Constitution vests “[a]ll legislative Powers” exclusively in Congress. U.S. \nConst., art. I, § 1. The Executive Branch has no power “to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.” \nClinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 438 (1998); see also U.S. Const., art. I, § 7, cl. 2 \n(Presentment Clause) (specifying the President’s limited role in enacting laws). \n137.  The Constitution also grants the “power of the purse”—the authority to raise and \nspend public money—exclusively to Congress. The Spending Clause gives to Congress alone the \npower to raise revenue and to “pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general \nWelfare of the United States.” U.S. Const., art. I, § 8, cl. 1. The Appropriations Clause reinforces \nCongress’s exclusive control over the public fisc: it prohibits the payment of any money from the \nTreasury unless the specific funds in question have been “appropriated”—that is, authorized for \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 45 of 55\nexpenditure for an identified purpose —by an act of Congress. Id. § 9, cl. 7. The “fundamental” \npurpose of the Appropriations Clause “is to assure that public funds will be spent according to the \nletter of the difficult judgments reached by Congress as to the common good and not according to \nthe individual favor of Government agents.” Off. of Pers. Mgmt. v. Richmond, 496 U.S. 414, 428 \n(1990); see also Cincinnati Soap Co. v. United States, 301 U.S. 308, 321 (1937) (observing that \nthe Appropriations Clause “was intended as a restriction upon the disbursing authority of the \nExecutive department”). \n138.  The  separation  of  powers  prohibits  the  Executive  from  usurping  Congress’s \nexclusive authority to legislate, to spend, and to appropriate public funds. City & Cnty. of S.F. v. \nTrump, 897 F.3d 1225, 1231 (9th Cir. 2018) (“[The] Constitution exclusively grants the power of \nthe purse to Congress, not the President.”). The Executive can no more refuse to spend money that \nCongress has directed it to spend—in the amount and for the purpose that Congress has specified \nin an appropriations act—than it can spend money without Congressional approval. If it does so, \nthe Executive violates the separation of powers and its own constitutionally mandated duty to “take \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.” Art. II, § 3. \n139.  As  Executive  Branch  officers,  Defendants  Kennedy  and  Monarez  have  no \nconstitutional authority to unilaterally amend or repeal any appropriations laws, including the \nCARES Act, the CRRSAA, and other acts passed during the height of the COVID-19 outbreak. \nNor has Congress given Defendants any such power by statute. Cf. Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. § 682 et seq. (specifying procedures, not applicable \nhere, by which the President may propose certain withholdings of budget authority, subject to \nCongressional review). Even if the Executive has “policy reasons” “for wanting to spend less than \nthe full amount appropriated by Congress for a particular project or program,” it “does not have \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 46 of 55\nunilateral authority to refuse to spend the funds.” In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. \nCir. 2013) (Kavanaugh, J.) (noting that, even in circumstances where statute permits the President \nto “propose the rescission of funds,” it remains with Congress to “decide whether to approve a \nrescission bill” (citing 2 U.S.C. § 683 and Train v. City of N.Y., 420 U.S. 35 (1975))). \n140.  Defendants’ Mass  Termination  Decision, and  its implementation, constitute a \nunilateral cancellation of Congressional appropriations by the Executive and therefore violates the \nconstitutional separation of powers. By terminating grant programs en masse because Congress \nauthorized the funding  of those programs  through “COVID-related” laws, Defendants  have \neffectively repealed those laws, in contravention of Congress’s exclusive power of the purse and \nthe Executive’s duties under the Take Care Clause.  \n141.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief \nprohibiting  Defendants  from  implementing  or  otherwise  enforcing  the  Mass  Termination \nDecision. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Mass Termination \nDecision and its implementation are unlawful and violate the constitutional separation of powers. \nCount II \nU.S. Constitution – Spending Clause \n(Against Defendants Kennedy and Monarez) \n \n142.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n143.  The federal courts possess the power in equity to grant injunctive relief “with \nrespect to violations of federal law by federal officials.” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27.  \n144.  Congress’s exercise of its Spending Clause power is limited. Congress may not \nplace conditions on grants to state and local governments unless those conditions are expressly \nand unambiguously stated in advance. Pennhurst State Sch. and Hosp. v. Haldermann, 451 U.S. \n1, 17 (1981) (explaining that there can be no voluntary and knowing acceptance if the recipient of \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 47 of 55\nfederal funding “is unable to ascertain” the conditions). The conditions must also relate to the \nfederal interest in the particular program. South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207–08 (1987).  \n145.  What the Spending Clause prevents Congress itself from doing, it also a fortiori \nprohibits Executive Branch officers—including Defendants Kennedy and Monarez—from doing. \n146.  Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision, and their implementation of it, violates \nthe Spending Clause because it retroactively conditions the receipt of federal funds in a manner \nunrelated to the federal interest in the affected programs. \n147.  The Mass Termination Decision imposes a retroactive and ambiguous condition on \nthe affected grant programs: it unilaterally alters the terms of those programs, requiring their \nimmediate and total cancellation based on Defendants’ sudden announcement of their opinion that \nthe programs are no longer necessary because the COVID-19 pandemic has ended. This condition \nwas not  expressly or unambiguously stated in  advance;  indeed, it contravenes the relevant \nCongressional appropriations acts, which do not make funding contingent on COVID-19’s status \nas a pandemic or authorize unilateral termination of funding based on Defendants’ views about \nCOVID-19. The condition also contradicts the federal government’s reaffirmations of the affected \nprograms after the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration expired in May of 2023.  \n148.  The condition imposed by the Mass Termination Decision is not reasonably related \nto  the  federal  interest  in  the  affected  programs.  No  authority,  including  the  applicable \nappropriations laws, makes COVID-19’s status as a “pandemic” relevant to the accomplishment \nof the grant programs’ purposes. In fact, that condition contradicts the federal interest in the \naffected programs, which are intended to support a range of public health initiatives, including \nlong term investments in public health infrastructure. \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 48 of 55\n149.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief \nprohibiting  Defendants  from  implementing  or  otherwise  enforcing  the  Mass  Termination \nDecision. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Mass Termination \nDecision and its implementation are unlawful and violate the Constitution. \nCount III \nEquitable Ultra Vires Claim \n(Against Defendants Kennedy and Monarez) \n \n150.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n151.  The equitable power of federal courts to enjoin “violations of federal law by federal \nofficials,” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 326–27, includes cases in which a federal officer has acted \nunconstitutionally as well as cases in which the officer has acted “beyond th[e] limitations” set by \nfederal statute. Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 689 (1949).  \n152.   Defendants Kennedy and Monarez lacked constitutional and statutory authority to \nissue or implement the Mass Termination Decision. As explained above, their actions violate the \nConstitution’s separation of powers, exceed the limits of the Spending Clause, and have no basis \nin any federal statute. \n153.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief \nprohibiting  Defendants  from  implementing  or  otherwise  enforcing  the  Mass  Termination \nDecision.  Plaintiffs  are  further  entitled  to  a  declaratory  judgment  that  Defendants’  actions, \nincluding the issuance and implementation of the Mass Termination Decision, are unlawful and \nexceed Defendants’ constitutional and statutory authority. \nCount IV \nAPA – Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision – Unconstitutional and Contrary to Statute \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n154.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 49 of 55\n155.  Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision, and its implementation, constitutes final \nagency action subject to APA review.  \n156.  The APA prohibits agency action that is “contrary to constitutional right, power, \nprivilege, or immunity . . . in excess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of \nstatutory right . . . or otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A)–(C). \n157.  The Executive Branch has no inherent constitutional authority to amend or repeal \nlegislation, including by refusing to spend funds in contravention of Congressional appropriations. \nDefendants’ Mass Termination Decision, and its implementation, does just that: it eliminates, \nwholesale, federal grant programs because they are funded through COVID-related appropriations \nlaws. Defendants’ assertion that the grant programs are no longer necessary is, at most, an ordinary \npolicy disagreement and does not give Defendants “unilateral authority to refuse to spend the \nfunds” that Congress has appropriated. In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 261 n.1.  \n158.  Defendants’ Mass  Termination  Decision, and its implementation,  violates the \nconstitutional separation of powers, and limitations on the Spending Clause power, and is therefore \n“contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(B). \n159.  Defendants’  Mass  Termination  Decision  and  its  implementation  is  also \nunauthorized by statute. It defies the relevant appropriations acts and is not permitted by any other \nstatute, including the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, 2 U.S.C. § 682 \net seq. Defendants’ nationwide termination of billions of dollars in critical public health funding \nalso runs afoul of the major question doctrine, which requires Congress to “speak clearly” if it \nintends to authorize agencies to exercise powers of “vast economic and political significance.” \nAla. Ass’n of Realtors v. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 594 U.S. 758, 764 (2021).  \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 50 of 55\n160.

Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to vacatur of the Mass Termination Decision, \nand of Defendants’ actions implementing the Mass Termination Decision, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. Plaintiffs are also entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \nDefendants from implementing or otherwise enforcing the Mass Termination Decision, and from \nreinstituting those actions for the same or similar reasons and without the necessary constitutional \nor statutory authority. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Mass \nTermination Decision is contrary to law, contrary to constitutional right and power, outside of \nDefendants’ statutory authority, and violates the APA. \n     Count V \nAPA – Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision – Violation of Agency Regulations  \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n162.  Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference all preceding paragraphs. \n163.  An agency violates the APA’s bar on arbitrary and capricious action, 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(A), “if it acts in a manner that is contrary to its own regulations.” Pol’y & Rsch., LLC v. \nU.S. Dep’t of Health & Hum. Servs., 313 F. Supp. 3d 62, 72 (D.D.C. 2018) (Jackson, J.). An agency \n“is not free to ‘ignore or violate its regulations while they remain in effect.’” Id. (quoting U.S. \nLines, Inc. v. Fed. Mar. Comm’n, 584 F.2d 519, 526 n.20 (D.C. Cir. 1978)); accord United States \nv. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 693–96 (1974); United States ex rel. Accardi v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. \n260 (1954). \n164.  The sole authority that Defendants allude to in support of the Mass Termination \nDecision and its implementation is a regulation, issued by HHS, which states that a “Federal \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 51 of 55\naward may  be  terminated  .  .  . for  cause.”  45  C.F.R.  § 75.372(a)(2)  (the  “HHS  For-Cause \nRegulation”). But nothing in that regulation’s history or prior interpretation by HHS supports \nDefendants’ use of it to terminate federal grant programs en masse, and in contravention of \nCongressional mandate, in order to advance their own policy views about COVID-19 or the \ncontinuing worth of critical public health programs. \n165.  Because the HHS For-Cause Regulation does not authorize Defendants’ Mass \nTermination Decision and its implementation, those agency actions are “arbitrary, capricious . . . \nor otherwise not in accordance with law.” 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n166.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to vacatur of the Mass Termination Decision, \nand of Defendants’ actions implementing the Mass Termination Decision, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. Plaintiffs are also entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \nDefendants from implementing or otherwise enforcing the Mass Termination Decision, and from \nreinstituting those actions for the same or similar reasons and without the necessary constitutional \nor statutory authority. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Mass \nTermination Decision is arbitrary, capricious, otherwise not in accordance with law, and violates \nthe APA. \nCount VI \nAPA – Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision – Arbitrary and Capricious \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n167.

Prometheus Radio Project, 592 U.S. 414, 423 \n(2021). Agency action violates this requirement \nif the agency has relied on factors which Congress has not intended it to consider, \nentirely  failed  to  consider  an  important  aspect  of  the  problem,  offered  an \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 52 of 55\nexplanation for its decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency, or \nis so implausible that it could not be ascribed to a difference in view or the product \nof agency expertise.  \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 (1983).  \n169.   Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision, and its implementation, is arbitrary and \ncapricious for multiple reasons. For example, Defendants’ reliance on the purported end of \nCOVID-19’s status as a “pandemic” for its decision to terminate the funding at issue is unexplained \nand inconsistent with appropriations laws and Congressional and agency actions following the \nexpiration of the COVID-19 public health emergency declaration in May of 2023. \n170.  Defendants’ stated reason for the Mass Termination Decision is also unreasonable \non its face. Defendants stated that the purpose of the terminated grant programs is to ameliorate \nthe effects of COVID-19, and then asserted in conclusory fashion that the end of COVID-19’s \n“pandemic” status negates that purpose, even though that status says nothing about the continuing \neffects of COVID-19 or the need to ameliorate those continuing effects.  \n171.  Congressional and agency actions have also made clear that the grant programs \nwere intended to respond to the long-term effects of the COVID-19 outbreak and to advance \nbroader  public  health  purposes  beyond  COVID-19,  including  investment  in  public  health \ninfrastructure. Defendants failed to consider these important aspects of the problem when issuing \nand implementing the Mass Termination Decision.  \n172.  Accordingly, Plaintiffs are entitled to vacatur of the Mass Termination Decision, \nand of Defendants’ actions implementing the Mass Termination Decision, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706. Plaintiffs are also entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting \nDefendants from implementing or otherwise enforcing the Mass Termination Decision, and from \nreinstituting those actions for the same or similar reasons and without the necessary constitutional \nor statutory authority. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a declaratory judgment that the Mass \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275     Document 1     Filed 04/24/25     Page 53 of 55\nTermination Decision is arbitrary, capricious, otherwise not in accordance with law, and violates \nthe APA. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray that this Court: \n(A) Declare unlawful and vacate Defendants’ Mass Termination Decision;  \n(B) Declare unlawful and vacate Defendants’ terminations of Plaintiffs’ grants; \n(C) Enjoin Defendants to reinstate the eliminated grant programs and to spend the funding \nappropriated  by  the  following  laws  for  the  purposes  specified  by  Congress:  The \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, Pub.

Case No. 25-cv-1275 (CRC) \n \nROBERT F. KENNEDY, JR., in his official \ncapacity as Secretary of the United States \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, et \nal.,   \nDefendants.          \n \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \nThe COVID-19 pandemic prompted Congress to enact a series of sweeping bipartisan \nmeasures in response to the most devastating public-health crisis the nation had experienced in a \ncentury.  The bulk of this legislation sought to ameliorate the immediate effects of the pandemic \nthrough, among other things, direct payments to taxpayers, extensions of unemployment \nbenefits, financial assistance to businesses, states, and municipalities, and funding for COVID-19 \ntesting and vaccine development.  At the same time, Congress took a longer view toward \nmitigating the risks and consequences of future pandemics.  It did so by authorizing billions of \ndollars for grants to state and local governments to modernize and improve their public-health \nsystems.  The Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) and the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention (“CDC”) proceeded to award these grants and make payments to the \nrecipients during both the first Trump administration and the Biden administration.  The grantees \nhave put the money to good use, investing in vaccine research, infection control, medical \ninfrastructure, patient outreach, and more.   \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 2 of 42\nBut the new Trump administration recently announced that it was terminating all grants \nissued under these COVID-era laws “for cause.”  Even though Congress clearly intended the \nfunding to address future pandemics and public-health issues as well, the sole reason offered for \nthe terminations was that the COVID-19 pandemic is over.  The terminations cancelled about \n$11 billion in future payments to grantees nationwide, forcing state and local governments to lay \noff staff and suspend ongoing public-health programs.   \nThe terminations included grants issued to four plaintiffs in this case: Harris County, \nTexas; Columbus, Ohio; Davidson County and Nashville, Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri.  \nThese jurisdictions sued, claiming that the rescissions violated not the terms of the individual \ngrants but the Constitution, the statutes authorizing the grants, and applicable federal regulations.  \nThey are joined by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees, AFL-\nCIO, a union that represents many employees who were affected by the grant terminations.   \nPlaintiffs now move for a preliminary injunction reversing the terminations.  As \nexplained below, the Court will grant plaintiffs’ motion in certain respects and deny it in others.  \nThe resulting relief will run only to some of the grants held by the four local-government \nplaintiffs, not to all terminated grants nationwide. \nI.  Background \nA.  Legislative Background \nThe grants involved in this case were issued under five statutes passed during the \nCOVID-19 pandemic.  The first three, which overlap significantly, are: (1) the Coronavirus \nPreparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2020 (“CPRSAA”), Pub. L. No. \n116-123, 134 Stat. 146 (2020); (2) the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \n(“CARES Act”), Pub. L. No. 116-136, 134 Stat. 281 (2020); and (3) the Coronavirus Response \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 3 of 42\nand Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act (“CRRSAA”) of 2021, Pub. L. No. 116-260, div. \nM., 134 Stat. 1182 (2020).  All three laws, which were passed by overwhelming bipartisan \nmajorities,1 appropriated billions of dollars “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus,” \nincluding about $7 billion that “shall be for grants to or cooperative agreements with” state and \nlocal governments and other entities.2  CPRSAA, 134 Stat. at 147; CARES Act, 134 Stat. at 554; \nCRRSAA, 134 Stat. at 1911–12.  All three define “coronavirus” as “SARS-CoV-2,” which is the \nvirus that causes COVID-19, “or another coronavirus with pandemic potential.”  CPRSAA, 134 \nStat. at 155; CARES Act, 134 Stat. at 614; CRRSAA, 134 Stat. at 1185. \nThe remaining two statutes are the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care \nEnhancement Act (“Paycheck Protection Act”), Pub. L. No. 116-139, 134 Stat. 620 (2020), and \nthe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, 135 Stat. 4 (2021).3  As relevant here, \nthese two laws also allocated federal funds for state and local entities to pursue a range of public-\n \n1 The CPRSAA passed by votes of 415–2 and 96–1 in the House and Senate respectively; \nthe CARES Act passed 419–6 and 96–0; and the CRRSAA passed as part of the 2021 \nConsolidated Appropriations Act 327–85 and 92–6.  H.R.6074 - Coronavirus Preparedness and \nResponse Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/6074; H.R.748 - CARES Act, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/748; H.R.6074 - Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental \nAppropriations Act, 2020, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6074. \n2 A cooperative agreement is a legal instrument by which the federal government enters a \n“relationship” with a recipient to provide support to the recipient in carrying out some public \npurpose.  See 31 U.S.C. § 6305.  Because the parties do not identify any relevant legal \ndifferences between grants and cooperative agreements, the Court will generally refer to the \nawards at issue here as “grants.” \n3 The Paycheck Protection Act also enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support, passing by \nunanimous consent in the Senate and by a vote of 388–5 in the House.  H.R.266 - Paycheck \nProtection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-\ncongress/house-bill/266.  The American Rescue Plan, however, was passed by a slim majority.  \nH.R.1319 - American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-\ncongress/house-bill/1319. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 4 of 42\nhealth initiatives.  The Paycheck Protection Act earmarked billions of dollars to state and local \ngovernments to “develop, purchase, administer, process, and analyze COVID-19 tests,” and \nimprove their testing infrastructure.  134 Stat. at 624.  The American Rescue Plan allocated \nbillions more for state and local governments to distribute COVID-19 vaccines, “strengthen \nvaccine confidence in the United States,” and “establish, expand, and sustain a public health \nworkforce.”  135 Stat. at 39, 41.  The relevant funding provisions were not expressly tied to the \nduration of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Congress made the funds available until they are \nexpended.  American Rescue Plan Act, 135 Stat. at 38; Paycheck Protection Act, 134 Stat. at \n623.   \nUsing this spending authority, HHS and the CDC issued billions of dollars of grants to \nstate and local governments to fund public-health projects.  In 2023, following the expiration of \nthe COVID-19 emergency declaration, Congress, again in bipartisan fashion, rescinded some \n$27 billion in pandemic-era appropriations via the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, Pub. L. No. \n118-5, 137 Stat. 10 (2023).  Because the Act rescinded only unobligated appropriations, any \ngrants that had already been issued were left undisturbed.  See id. at 23–30; 2d Decl. of Jamie \nLegier (“2d Legier Decl.”) ¶¶ 18, 22. \nB.  Factual Background and Procedural History \nPlaintiffs include four local governments: Harris County, Texas; Columbus, Ohio; \nDavidson County and Nashville, Tennessee; and Kansas City, Missouri.  These jurisdictions \nreceived grants under the five pandemic-era funding laws discussed above.  They are joined by \nthe American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFL-CIO (“AFSCME”), a \nunion representing employees of local and state governments across the country that also \nreceived grants under those statutes.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 5 of 42\nThe relevant grants were issued by HHS and the CDC.  They were intended for a wide \nrange of public-health purposes beyond the COVID-19 emergency, including hiring staff for \nmunicipal public-health departments, launching vaccination drives in underserved communities, \nbuilding labs to test for infectious diseases, modernizing recordkeeping systems, investing in \ninfection surveillance, and more.  See PI Mot. at 9–11 (summarizing declarations in the record \nfrom grant recipients).  None of these grants was affected by Congress’s subsequent recission of \nCOVID-19-specific funding in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023. \nOn March 24, 2025, the new Trump administration abruptly changed course.  It decided \nto terminate and cease payments on all the grants at issue.  HHS notified grantees via a template \nletter stating that the grants had been terminated “for cause” because “[t]he end of the pandemic \nprovide[d] cause to terminate COVID-related grants and cooperative agreements.”  See, e.g., \nDecl. of Brandon Maddox (“Maddox Decl.”), Ex. A at 5 (sample termination letter).  For grants \nthat went to state pass-through entities, state authorities informed the local recipients of HHS’s \ndecision and directed them to pause any spending of grant money.  See, e.g., Decl. of Edward \nJohnson (“Johnson Decl.”), Ex. A. (sample notice email).  The four local-government plaintiffs \nhad roughly $32.7 million in future grant payments due to them when the grants were \nterminated.  Pls.’ Resp. Gov’t Suppl. Decl. at 2.   \nSeveral states then sued HHS in the District of Rhode Island alleging that the rescissions \nviolated the Constitution, various statutes, and agency regulations.  See Compl. ¶¶ 96–\n130, Colorado v. Dep’t of Health & Human Servs., No. 1:25-cv-121-MSM-LDA (D.R.I. filed \nApril 1, 2025).  That court issued a temporary restraining order and then a preliminary injunction \nagainst the government, enjoining the rescissions and barring HHS from withholding funds \nbased on the terminations.  Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *5, 24.  The order, however, was \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 6 of 42\nlimited to the plaintiff states, id. at *24, and none of the local-government plaintiffs here are in \nthose states.  As a result, the local-government plaintiffs filed their own lawsuit in this Court and \npromptly moved for a preliminary injunction.  The Court heard argument on that motion, which \nis now ripe for the Court’s consideration. \nII.  Legal Standard \n“A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.”  Winter \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  A party seeking such relief must, “by a clear \nshowing, carr[y] the burden of persuasion” and demonstrate “(1) a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits, (2) that it would suffer irreparable injury if the injunction were not \ngranted, (3) that an injunction would not substantially injure other interested parties, and (4) that \nthe public interest would be furthered by the injunction.”  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. \nEngland, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006); see Winter, 555 U.S. at 20.  The last two factors \nmerge when the government is a party.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nIII.  Analysis \nThe Court will begin with plaintiffs’ standing before turning to the likelihood of success \non the merits, irreparable harm, and the balance of equities. \nA.  Standing \nAll five plaintiffs have standing.  Begin with the local governments.  To establish \nstanding, they must show “(1) an injury in fact, (2) a sufficient causal connection between the \ninjury and the conduct complained of, and (3) a likelihood that the injury will be redressed by a \nfavorable decision.”  Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus, 573 U.S. 149, 157–58 (2014) (cleaned \nup).  Here, the government’s termination of the grants deprived the jurisdictions of funding.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 7 of 42\nThat injury could be redressed by an injunction vacating the termination decisions.  The \ngovernment does not argue otherwise. \nThe government does challenge AFSCME’s standing.  The Court will begin, and end, \nwith associational standing.  An association has standing on behalf of its members when “(a) its \nmembers would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to \nprotect are germane to the organization’s purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the \nrelief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit.”  Hunt v. Wash. \nState Apple Advert. Comm’n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).  Here, individual members of AFSCME \nhave standing because they were employed by grant recipients and were let go because their \nemployers lost grant funding.  E.g., Decl. of Heidi Heddings (“Heddings Decl.”) ¶¶ 2, 5–7, 9 \n(AFSCME member notified that she would be laid off due to the loss of government funding); \nDecl. of Eva Hewitt Decl. (“Hewitt Decl.”) ¶¶ 2, 7 (similar); see Summers v. Earth Island Inst., \n555 U.S. 488, 498 (2009) (holding that an organization must provide “specific facts . . . that one \nor more of [its] members would be directly affected” by the challenged action (cleaned up)).  \nThose employees’ interests in continued employment are plainly germane to AFSCME’s purpose \nas a labor union advocating on its members’ behalf.  Finally, individual participation by \nAFSCME members is not necessary here, as is typically the case “when an association seeks \nprospective or injunctive relief for its members[.]”  United Food & Com. Workers Union Local \n751 v. Brown Grp., Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 546 (1996).  The government does not dispute that all the \ngrants across the country were terminated wholesale for the same reason and in the same manner.  \nDetermining whether those terminations were lawful therefore does not require participation by \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 8 of 42\nindividual AFSCME members because they were all affected by the same government action.  \nAFSCME thus has associational standing.4 \nB.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nTo obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must make “a clear showing” that they have \na “substantial likelihood of success on the merits” of their claims.  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297.  \nPlaintiffs assert six claims.  They allege that the terminations (1) violate the separation of \npowers; (2) violate the Spending Clause; (3) are ultra vires; (4) violate the appropriations statutes \nthat authorized the grants; (5) violate HHS regulations; and (6) are arbitrary and capricious.  See \nCompl. ¶¶ 133–72.  The Court concludes that, at this early stage in this case, plaintiffs have \ndemonstrated a likelihood of partial success on the merits as to their separation of powers and \nultra vires claims but not as to the remaining four claims. \n1.  Separation of Powers \na.  Jurisdiction \nBefore reaching the merits of plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers claim, the Court first must \ndetermine whether it has statutory jurisdiction to consider it or, as the government argues, the \nTucker Act vests exclusive jurisdiction in the Court of Federal Claims.  The Court recently \nconfronted the same question when it issued a preliminary injunction in American Bar \nAssociation v. Department of Justice, No. 25-cv-1263 (CRC), 2025 WL 1388891 (D.D.C. May \n14, 2025).  That case involved a First Amendment retaliation challenge to DOJ’s rescission of \ndomestic-violence training grants issued to the American Bar Association.  Id. at *1.  As the \n \n4 Because the Court concludes that AFSCME has associational standing, it need not \ndecide whether AFSCME also has organizational standing due to a concrete impairment of its \norganizational mission.  See FDA v. All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 393–94 (2024) \n(discussing organizational standing). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 9 of 42\nCourt explained there, the Tucker Act deprives this Court of jurisdiction when a claim is “at its \nessence contractual[.]”  Id. at *5; see Crowley Gov’t Servs. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1102 (D.C. \nCir. 2022).  The “longstanding test” in this Circuit to determine whether a claim is essentially \ncontractual examines “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims” and “the \ntype of relief sought.”  ABA, 2025 WL 1388891, at *5 (quoting Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106); see \nMegapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982). \nBeginning with the test’s first prong, the source of the right plaintiffs seek to vindicate \nthrough their separation-of-powers claim is the Constitution.  The core principle underlying this \nclaim is that the Constitution gives Congress, not the Executive Branch, exclusive power over \nspending.  See Dep’t of Navy v. FLRA, 665 F.3d 1339, 1346 (D.C. Cir. 2012) (Kavanaugh, J.) \n(describing Congress’s “exclusive power over the federal purse”).  That principle in turn requires \nagencies to spend the money that Congress appropriates in a manner consistent with Congress’s \ndirections.  The Executive Branch, in other words, cannot decline to spend congressionally \nappropriated funds simply because it prefers not to spend them.  That is precisely what plaintiffs’ \nseparation-of-powers claim alleges here:  HHS refused to spend the money as Congress directed \nbased on its own policy-driven assessment of what public-health spending is necessary following \nthe end of the COVID-19 emergency.  They argue that HHS’s refusal to spend is inconsistent \nwith the broader, forward-looking goals Congress sought to achieve through the grants, as well \nas Congress’s decision not to rescind the appropriations that funded those grants even after the \nemergency period had passed.  Thus, the thrust of plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers claim is that \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 10 of 42\nHHS has acted unconstitutionally by refusing to spend funds, not that HHS breached any \nindividual grant’s terms.5   \nTo be sure, the spending that plaintiffs claim was unlawfully withheld is, in a sense, \n“contractual” in that the funds were obligated as part of grants to or cooperative agreements with \nstate and local governments.  But as the Court explained in ABA, and the D.C. Circuit has \nrepeatedly held, the mere presence of a contract in relation to a claim is not enough to deprive \nthis a district court of jurisdiction over the claim.  2025 WL 1388891, at *5; Crowley, 38 F.4th at \n1106.  What matters for purposes of plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers claim is that the Executive \nBranch allegedly did not spend funds that it was required to spend, not that the funds were \nearmarked for contractual grant payments.  Had the funds been earmarked to fund, say, public \nawareness campaigns by HHS itself rather than grants to state and local governments, the \nseparation-of-powers analysis would be the same. \nThe government’s assertion of a contractual defense—that the end of the COVID-19 \npandemic was somehow “cause” for terminating the grants—does not change the analysis either, \nfor similar reasons.  In Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959 (D.C. Cir. 1982), Megapulse, a \nfederal contractor, alleged that the government impermissibly disclosed proprietary information \nthat the company had produced to the government as part of its contractual duties.  Id. at 961–62.  \nThe government argued in response that its contracts with Megapulse permitted the release of the \ninformation at issue and so the case belonged in the Court of Federal Claims.  Id. at 969.  The \nD.C. Circuit sided with Megapulse.  Id. at 969–70.  It held that “the mere existence of such \n \n5 Of course, plaintiffs may well be wrong about what the separation of powers permits, \nbut that goes to the merits of their claim, not the Court’s jurisdiction.  “[I]t is common practice \nfor federal courts to evaluate their subject-matter jurisdiction (or lack thereof) . . . separate and \napart from the merits of the plaintiff’s claims.”  Cause of Action Inst. v. IRS, 390 F. Supp. 3d 94, \n98 (D.D.C. 2019) (K.B. Jackson, J.). \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 11 of 42\ncontract-related issues” was not enough to “convert this action to one based on the contract.”  Id. \nat 969.  Same here:  The government’s defense that HHS was entitled to cancel the grants under \ntheir “for cause” termination provision does not convert plaintiffs’ affirmative separation-of-\npowers claim into a contractual one. \nNor does it matter to the jurisdictional analysis that plaintiffs sued only after their grants \nwere terminated.  While that fact may go to plaintiffs’ injury for standing purposes, it does not \ndefine the source or nature of their constitutional claim.  As the Supreme Court has made clear, \nstanding is analytically distinct from the plaintiff’s legal rights.  TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n594 U.S. 413, 427–30 (2021).  Plaintiffs must show that the alleged violation of their legal rights \ninjured them in some concrete and particularized way.  Id.  Applying that framework here, \nplaintiffs’ claim is that the Executive Branch violated their rights under the separation of powers \nby refusing to spend monies that Congress appropriated.  So understood, plaintiffs’ claim is that \nthe Executive Branch is required to follow the law—not the law of contracts, but the law of the \nConstitution.  That kind of claim is often difficult to bring because in many cases the plaintiff \nmerely has “[a]n interest shared generally with the public at large in the proper application of the \nConstitution and laws,” which “will not do.”  Arizonans for Off. Eng. v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, \n64 (1997).  These plaintiffs, by contrast, have a concrete and particularized interest because their \ngrants were directly affected by the alleged noncompliance.  The grants therefore supply the link \nrequired by Article III between plaintiffs and the Executive Branch’s allegedly unlawful decision \nnot to spend appropriated funds.  The grants do not, however, transform a claim anchored in the \nConstitution into one “founded on a contract,” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. \nMoving to the second prong of the D.C. Circuit’s test for determining whether a claim is \ncontractual (the type of relief sought), the injunctive, prospective relief plaintiffs seek also \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 12 of 42\nsupports district-court jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs “seek[] a declaration that Defendants acted \nunlawfully when they terminated the grants . . . and an injunction preventing Defendants from \nterminating the agreements on that basis.”  ABA, 2025 WL 1388891, at *6.  Courts have long \ngranted such injunctions to remedy “violations of federal law by federal officials.”  Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 327 (2015) (citing Am. Sch. of Magnetic Healing v. \nMcAnnulty, 187 U.S. 94, 110 (1902)).  And while plaintiffs’ requested remedy may “effectively \nresult in the continuation of monetary grants payment by the federal government,” ABA, 2025 \nWL 1388891, at *6, the Supreme Court has held that such an order “undo[ing]” agency action is \nnot an order for “money damages[.]”  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 (1988).  As \nfurther evidence that plaintiffs are not seeking damages, they expressly disavowed any \nretroactive payments and request only vacatur of the allegedly unlawful terminations.  Oral Arg. \nTr. at 17:1–7.   \nAccordingly, plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers claim is not essentially contractual under \nthe D.C. Circuit’s two-part test. \nThe Supreme Court’s recent order in Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. \n966 (2025), does not change the Court’s conclusion.  The only claim before the Supreme Court \nin that case was that the government’s mass termination of grants was arbitrary and capricious \nunder the APA.  Id. at 968; see id. at 975–76 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (discussing plaintiffs’ \narbitrary-and-capricious challenge to the grant terminations).  The Supreme Court’s order \ntherefore says nothing about whether constitutional claims like this one must be funneled to the \nCourt of Federal Claims simply because they implicate a contract.  See ABA, 2025 WL \n1388891, at *6 (holding that the Court had jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim \ndespite the Supreme Court’s order in Department of Education).  The Court will elaborate on the \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 13 of 42\ncontours of Department of Education below in discussing plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious \nclaim. \nFinally, the Court concludes that it likely has jurisdiction over plaintiffs’ separation-of-\npowers claim because the Court of Federal Claims appears not to have jurisdiction and cannot \ngrant the prospective relief that plaintiffs seek.  The D.C. Circuit has “categorically reject[ed] the \nsuggestion that a federal district court can be deprived of jurisdiction by the Tucker Act when no \njurisdiction lies in the Court of Federal Claims.”  Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 176 \n(D.C. Cir. 2006).  The Federal Circuit has in turn held that “the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments, the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and the \ndoctrine of the separation of powers” do not provide “a sufficient basis for jurisdiction” in the \nCourt of Federal Claims “because they do not mandate payment of money by the government.”  \nLeBlanc v. United States, 50 F.3d 1025, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 1995).  The Supreme Court has also \nobserved that “the Court of Federal Claims does not have the general equitable powers of a \ndistrict court to grant prospective relief[.]”  Me. Cmty. Health Options v. United States, 590 U.S. \n296, 327 (2020) (quotation marks omitted).  Tellingly, the government demurred at oral \nargument when asked whether the Court of Federal Claims would have jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’ claims in this case or could afford plaintiffs relief.  See Oral Arg. Tr. 49:16–50:16.   \nThe Court rejects the government’s implicit suggestion that no court would have \njurisdiction over constitutional claims that happen to involve a contract.  If the government were \nright, then no court would have jurisdiction over a First Amendment retaliation claim like the \none in ABA.  And no court would have jurisdiction over a claim that the government rescinded \ncontracts on the basis of protected traits like race, religion, or sex.  Foreclosing judicial review \nentirely to such a broad class of constitutional claims cannot be reconciled with the “strong \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 14 of 42\npresumption favoring judicial review of administrative action,” Mach Mining, LLC v. EEOC, \n575 U.S. 480, 486 (2015), and the “long history of judicial review of illegal executive action, \ntracing back to England,” Armstrong, 575 U.S. at 327.  And to the extent the government is \narguing that “[a] separation-of-powers claim should be treated differently than every other \nconstitutional claim, it offers no reason and cites no authority why that might be so.”  Free \nEnterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010). \nb.  Congress’s Spending Power \nBefore turning to the merits, the Court will take one more detour to provide some \nbackground on Congress’s appropriations power.  The Constitution vests Congress with the \npower to pass spending laws and the President with the duty to “faithfully execute[]” those laws.  \nU.S. Const. Art. I § 8 cl. 1; id. Art. II § 3.  That allocation of authority gives Congress the ability \nto set how the federal government spends its money.  So when Congress calls for money to be \nspent, the President generally must spend it.  In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 261 n.1 (D.C. Cir. \n2013) (Kavanaugh, J.); Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 44 (1975) (holding that if \nCongress authorizes some amount, then the President must allot that amount for expenditure).  \nThe President can, with the consent of Congress, rescind certain appropriations by following \nprocedures set forth in the Impoundment Act, 2 U.S.C. § 683.   \nWhen Congress appropriates funds for expenditure, it can specify that those funds will be \navailable until a certain date or for certain purposes.  Gov’t Accounting Off., 1 Principles of \nFederal Appropriations Law 5-3 (3d ed. 2004) (citing 13 Op. Att’y Gen. 288, 292 (1870) \n(recognizing that the Executive Branch should follow the limitations Congress sets on funding)).  \nSuch an appropriation might look something like this:  “There is hereby appropriated $5,000,000 \nto remain available until September 30, 2025, for office supplies.”  That provision specifies the \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 15 of 42\namount the agency must spend ($5 million), the date by which the agency must spend it \n(September 30, 2025), and what the agency must spend it on (office supplies).  The agency \nwould then “obligate” those funds, perhaps by placing a rather large order of pens, and then \nspend the funds by paying the agency’s chosen vendor.  Once the September 30 deadline passes, \nhowever, federal law would generally prohibit the agency from further obligating or re-\nobligating that $5 million.  31 U.S.C. § 1502(a); 1 Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 5-\n80. \nAppropriations for federal grants and cooperative agreements work much the same way.  \nIf Congress appropriates money for certain grants and specifies a deadline to obligate those \nfunds, then the agency must issue grants up until that deadline.  31 U.S.C. § 1502(a).  The grant \nperiods may extend beyond the availability deadline.  For example, agencies may issue a two-\nyear grant using funds made available for only one year so long as the grant was issued prior to \nthe one-year deadline.  See 1 Principles of Federal Appropriations Law 5-48–50.  But once the \navailability deadline passes, the agency cannot issue any new grants or re-obligate the funding. \nOnce Congress appropriates the funds, it ordinarily leaves agencies “significant \ndiscretion in administering the funds appropriated[.]”  AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. Dep’t of \nState, No. 25-cv-400 (AHA), 2025 WL 752378, at *17 (D.D.C. March 10, 2025).  When \n“Congress merely appropriates lump-sum amounts without statutorily restricting what can be \ndone with those funds, a clear inference arises that it does not intend to impose legally binding \nrestrictions[.]”  Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S. 182, 192 (1993).  The upshot is that if Congress \nspeaks, agencies must listen.  If it does not, then agencies are left with broad discretion as to how \nto spend appropriated funds.  \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 16 of 42\nc.  Merits \nThose principles in mind, the Court turns to the merits of plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers \nclaim and concludes that they are likely to succeed as to grants issued under statutes whose \navailability deadlines have passed. \nBegin with the statutes whose funds are no longer available for obligation.  The \nappropriations under three of the five statutes at issue in this case—the CPRSAA, CARES Act, \nand CRRSAA—have expired.  See CPRSAA, 134 Stat. at 147 (funds “to remain available until \nSeptember 30, 2022”); CARES Act, 134 Stat. at 554 (“September 30, 2024”); CRRSAA, 134 \nStat. at 1911 (“September 30, 2024”).  As a result, those funds are no longer available for new \nobligations or re-obligation.  So, by canceling the challenged grants at issue in this case, the \nExecutive Branch has effectively said that it will never spend the funds that Congress \nappropriated—without invoking either the Impoundment Act or any other statute that might \nauthorize the rescission of appropriated funds. \nThe Executive Branch does not have such broad power to refuse to spend appropriated \nfunds.  As then-Judge Kavanaugh put it, “the President does not have unilateral authority to \nrefuse to spend” funds that Congress has appropriated simply because of “policy reasons[.]”  In \nre Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 261 n.1.  Or, as former Chief Justice Rehnquist put it while serving \nin the Executive Branch:  “With respect to the suggestion that the President has a constitutional \npower to decline to spend appropriated funds, we must conclude that existence of such a broad \npower is supported by neither reason nor precedent.”  Id. (quoting Memorandum from William \nH. Rehnquist, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to Edward L. Morgan, \nDeputy Counsel to the President (Dec. 1, 1969), reprinted in Executive Impoundment of \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 17 of 42\nAppropriated Funds: Hearings Before the Subcomm. on Separation of Powers of the S. Comm. \non the Judiciary, 92d Cong. 279, 282 (1971)). \nThe question, then, is whether it appears likely that HHS refused to spend \ncongressionally appropriated funds here for policy reasons.  The template grant termination \nletters explained that “[n]ow that the pandemic is over, the grants and cooperative agreements \nare no longer necessary as their limited purpose has run out.”  Maddox Decl. Ex. A at 5.  On its \nface, that explanation sounds in the affirmative contract defense of frustration of purpose, which \nmight in some circumstances relieve the government from fulfilling its payment obligations \nunder the grants. \nBut Congress has expressly rejected HHS’s position not just once but twice when it made \nclear that augmenting municipal public-health spending is necessary separate from the COVID-\n19 emergency.  When Congress passed these three statutes, it specified that the funds were \nintended to fight “coronavirus” generally, which includes both the virus that causes COVID-19 \nand “another coronavirus with pandemic potential.”  CPRSAA, 134 Stat. at 147, 155; CARES \nAct, 134 Stat. at 554, 614; CRRSAA, 134 Stat. at 1185, 1911–12.  Congress thus expressed its \njudgment that spending was needed for both the immediate term and after the pandemic had run \nits course.  Congress made its goals even more explicit when it passed the Fiscal Responsibility \nAct of 2023 after the pandemic had ended.  A large bipartisan majority of Congress rescinded \nsome pandemic-era funds but left the funds at issue here untouched, doubling down on \nCongress’s view that spending to combat coronavirus in general should continue even after the \npandemic ended.   \nAgainst this backdrop, HHS’s refusal to spend the appropriated grant funds is revealed as \na quintessential policy choice by the Executive Branch:  We no longer think it necessary to spend \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 18 of 42\nfederal funds on helping local governments prevent and mitigate future pandemics because the \nlatest one has ended.  That may be a defensible policy determination, but it cannot be squared \nwith Congress’s contrary legislative choices.  When such a conflict arises, controlling law is \nclear:  Congress’s laws trump the President’s preferences.  In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 261 \nn.1.  \nThe government responds that it satisfied any statutory duties Congress imposed.  It \npoints out that it obligated sufficient funds by issuing grants whose total value exceeded the \nminimum amount Congress allocated for grants under the relevant statutes.  See 2d Legier Decl. \nEx. 1.  And, as to the CPRSAA and CARES Act, it says, it actually spent the minimum amount \nthat Congress authorized for state and local government grants.  Id.  Both arguments come up \nshort. \nThe government cites no authority for its contention that appropriations statutes require \nagencies merely to obligate, rather than spend, appropriated funds.  See Gov’t Opp’n at 28.  Nor \ncould it, given that the D.C. Circuit has made clear that “the President does not have unilateral \nauthority to refuse to spend” based solely on policy reasons.  In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 261 \nn.1 (emphasis added); see also AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal., 2025 WL 752378, at *17 \n(“[A]ppropriations laws reflect an exercise of Congress’s own, core constitutional power to \ndetermine whether and how much money is spent.”).  In any case, even if the government were \ncorrect, HHS has now de-obligated these funds.  It would make a mockery of Congress’s \nspending power if the Executive Branch could fulfill its constitutional and statutory duties \nthrough the sleight of hand of obligating funds and later de-obligating them. \nNor has the government established that HHS satisfied its spending requirements by \ndisbursing the minimum amount of money required by Congress to state and local governments \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 19 of 42\nfor grants under two of the statutes.  The relevant appropriations bills set both a top-line spend \nnumber and a minimum amount that must be used for grants.  For example, the CARES Act \nappropriated $4.3 billion “to prevent, prepare for, and respond to coronavirus,” and allocated \n“not less than” $1.5 billion for grants and cooperative agreements.  134 Stat. at 554.  The fact \nthat HHS has paid out more than $1.5 billion in grant money under the CARES Act does not \nsatisfy the separate requirement that HHS spend $4.3 billion in total.  To be sure, Congress did \nnot require HHS to spend more than $1.5 billion in grants.  But HHS nevertheless obligated more \nthan $1.5 billion in grants from the $4.3 billion Congress appropriated.  And because the funds \nthat were obligated have expired and are no longer available for new obligations, HHS’s decision \nto de-obligate funds by terminating grants under the CARES Act amounts to a refusal to spend \nthe total amount that Congress appropriated.6 \nTo be clear, the Court does not mean to say that the Executive Branch must spend every \nsingle penny of every single appropriation that Congress passes.  The Court does not, for \nexample, think it unconstitutional for an agency project to come in under budget.  There may \nalso be circumstances where agencies terminate grants for bona fide reasons such as misconduct \nby the grantee and do not re-obligate the funds due to practicality reasons or administrative \noversight.  In such circumstances, the Court doubts that leaving spare change in the couch \ncushions violates the separation of powers.  The D.C. Circuit also has acknowledged that the \nPresident may be able to decline to spend funds on activities he independently believes would be \nunlawful.  See In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 262 n.3.  But none of those scenarios fit what HHS \n \n6 The above does not change the source of plaintiffs’ right for jurisdictional purposes.  \nAgain, the mere fact that the spending at issue is in some sense “contractual” in nature is \nimmaterial to this analysis.  The same result would follow even if the cancelled spending had not \nbeen in the form of grant agreements. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 20 of 42\nhas done here.  HHS appears instead to have willfully decided not to spend funds based on policy \nobjections to Congress’s enactments, objections that Congress has overruled not once but twice.  \nIn doing so, the agency likely violated the separation of powers.  Id. at 261 n.1. \nThe two remaining appropriations bills, the American Rescue Plan Act and the Paycheck \nProtection Act, are different.  Those two statutes made funds “available until expended[.]”  \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act, 135 Stat. at 38; Paycheck Protection Act, 134 Stat. at 623.  Those \nopen-ended appropriations mean that HHS can re-obligate any money freed up by the \ntermination of plaintiffs’ grants.  In other words, HHS has not refused to spend these funds; it \nhas declined to spend them in a certain way.   \nSo if plaintiffs are to show a likelihood of success on their separation-of-powers claim as \nto grants issued under these statutes, they must demonstrate that Congress specified the manner \nin which these funds would be spent.  To do so, plaintiffs rely again on Congress’s rescission of \nCOVID-19-specific grants through the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.  Congress’s \nforbearance as to other grants, plaintiffs argue, reveals that “HHS had no authority to cancel any \ngrants that Congress left in place” in 2023.  Oral Arg. Tr. at 7:21–25.   \nPlaintiffs place too much weight on congressional silence.  The default presumption \nwhen Congress does not specify restrictions on how a lump-sum appropriation must be used is \nthat it meant to “leave[] it to the recipient agency . . . to distribute the funds among some or all of \nthe permissible objects as it sees fit[.]”  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192 (quoting Int’l Union, United \nAuto., Aerospace & Ag. Implement Workers of Am. v. Donovan, 746 F.2d 855, 861 (D.C. Cir. \n1984)).  Here, nothing in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 purports to limit agency \ndiscretion over how to spend appropriated funds.  All the relevant part of the bill does is march \nthrough a long list of dozens of appropriations and either rescind them or reduce their amount.  \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 21 of 42\nSee Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, 137 Stat. at 23–30.  Had Congress meant to forbid HHS \nfrom canceling the grants at issue, it could have easily said as much.  But it did not.  So the \n“clear inference” from Congress’s decision to leave well enough alone is that it did not intend to \nlimit further what HHS could do with funds appropriated under the American Rescue Plan Act \nand the Paycheck Protection Act.  Lincoln, 508 U.S. at 192.  \nTo be sure, as discussed above, Congress’s decision to maintain appropriations under the \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act and Paycheck Protection Act makes clear that Congress wanted those \nfunds to be spent.  But the Executive Branch can still fulfill that statutory mandate by \nreallocating the cancelled grant money.  While the odds of that might appear slim given the \ncurrent administration’s posture towards public-health spending, plaintiffs have presented no \nevidence that this administration (or for that matter, a future administration) cannot, or will not, \ndo so.  They have therefore failed, at this early stage, to demonstrate that they are likely to \nsucceed on their claim that the Executive Branch violated the separation of powers by \nterminating grants issued under the American Rescue Plan Act or the Paycheck Protection Act. \n2.  Spending Clause \nNext, plaintiffs argue that the grant terminations violate the Spending Clause.  Because \nthis claim could potentially afford plaintiffs relief as to grants issued under the American Rescue \nPlan Act and the Paycheck Protection Act, the Court will assess whether plaintiffs have \nestablished a likelihood of success on the merits of this claim.   \nTo begin, the Court likely has jurisdiction over this claim for the same reason it has \njurisdiction over plaintiffs’ separation-of-powers claim:  This claim is constitutional, not \ncontractual.  But plaintiffs have not otherwise demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 22 of 42\nThe Spending Clause permits Congress to spend money to “provide for the common \nDefence and general Welfare of the United States[.]”  U.S. Const. Art. I § 8 cl. 1.  That grant of \nauthority, while broad, is not unlimited.  As relevant here, when Congress chooses to attach \nstrings or conditions to grant funding, it must do so “unambiguously” such that the recipient \nknowingly accepts those terms.  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 208 (1987); see Pennhurst \nState Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, 17 (1981).  As a corollary to that requirement, \nCongress may not “surpris[e]” grantees with “post acceptance or ‘retroactive’ conditions.”  \nPennhurst, 451 U.S. at 25.  Here, plaintiffs argue that terminating the grants at issue on the \ngrounds that the COVID-19 emergency has ended violated these constitutional principles by \nadding a retroactive condition to the grants. \nAt the outset, it is unclear that this limitation on Congress’s spending power applies to the \nExecutive Branch.  The Spending Clause grants authority to Congress in Article I.  It does not, \non its face, purport to limit what the Executive Branch may do under Article II.  And the Court is \nnot aware of any cases that have extended Spending Clause doctrines to the Executive Branch.  \n(Presumably, the argument for extending those cases would be that if Congress cannot do \nsomething, then the Executive Branch cannot do it either when executing the laws that Congress \nhas passed.)  But because the government did not dispute that this limit on Congress’s authority \nalso extends to the Executive Branch, see Gov’t Opp’n at 32, the Court will assume without \ndeciding for the purposes of this motion that the Spending Clause also prohibits the Executive \nBranch from imposing retroactive conditions on grant awards.7 \n \n7 The APA, which prohibits arbitrary and capricious agency action and requires agencies \nto explain themselves when they change course, may separately limit the government’s ability to \nimpose retroactive conditions on grant awards.  Cf. FDA v. Wages & White Lion Investments, \nLLC, 145 S. Ct. 898, 918–19 (2025) (describing the change-in-position doctrine and noting its \noverlap with constitutional due process protections). \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 23 of 42\nThe government instead argues that any conditions on the grants were adequately \ncommunicated to plaintiffs in advance because the relevant award documents expressly permit \nthe agency to terminate the grants for cause.  See Gov’t Opp’n at 32; id. Ex. F at 42 (grant award \nto Harris County providing for for-cause termination).  HHS regulations—which plaintiffs are \npresumed to have been aware of when they accepted the funds—also permit HHS to terminate a \ngrant award “for cause[.]”  45 C.F.R. § 75.372(a)(2); see Heckler v. Cmty. Health Servs. of \nCrawford Cnty., Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 63 (1984) (“[T]hose who deal with the Government are \nexpected to know the law[.]”).  As a result, the key issue here is what constitutes “cause” for \ntermination.8  Plaintiffs primarily argue that “cause” for termination refers to when a grantee \nfails to comply with the terms of the grant.  See PI Mot. at 25; PI Reply at 16–17.  That \nargument, while plausible, is not entirely persuasive. \nIn support of their position, plaintiffs rely mainly on past HHS adjudicatory decisions, \nincluding one in which the agency opined:  “‘For cause’ means a grantee has materially failed to \ncomply with the terms of the grant.’”  Child Care Ass’n of Wichita/Sedgwick County, 1982 WL \n189587, at *2 (H.H.S. June 8, 1982); see also Kisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 573 (2019) (noting \nthat courts may rely on agency interpretations to the extent they have the “power to persuade”).  \nPlaintiffs also point out that the relevant HHS regulation is housed under a subpart of the Code \nof Federal Regulations titled “Remedies for Noncompliance.”  45 C.F.R. Part 75 Subpart D.   \nOn the other hand, strong textual evidence suggests that “cause” is not so limited.  Courts \nordinarily, though not always, read statutes and regulations to avoid surplusage.  See Newman v. \nFERC, 27 F.4th 690, 698–99 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  Plaintiffs’ definition of “cause” runs headlong \n \n8 The government seems to assume, and plaintiffs do not appear to dispute, that “cause” \nmeans the same thing under both the grant awards and the relevant HHS regulations.  See Gov’t \nOpp’n at 28–29; PI Reply at 12–13, 16–17. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 24 of 42\ninto this presumption.  The relevant HHS regulation provides that a grant “may be terminated in \nwhole or in part as follows: (1) . . . if the non-Federal entity fails to comply with the terms and \nconditions of the award; [or] (2) . . . for cause[.]”  45 C.F.R. § 75.372(a)(1)–(2).  If, as plaintiffs \nargue, “cause” merely refers to noncompliance, then part (2) would be entirely duplicative of \npart (1). \nAt oral argument, plaintiffs raised the possibility that “cause” refers to more general \n“wrongdoing” by the grantee.  Oral Arg. Tr. at 15:17–19.  That argument might solve the \nsurplusage problem.  But it is underdeveloped at this early juncture.  It was not raised in \nplaintiffs’ briefing and plaintiffs do not cite any evidence or authority in support of that \ninterpretation.  Contrast Pierre-Noel ex rel. K.N. v. Bridges Public Charter Sch., 113 F.4th 970, \n980–82 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (relying on dictionaries and the statute’s terms, scheme, and purpose” to \nanalyze the scope of a funding condition); see also Kisor, 588 U.S. at 575 (holding that courts \nmust “exhaust all the traditional tools of construction” when analyzing agency regulations).   \nPlaintiffs’ cursory treatment of this argument is insufficient to establish a likelihood of success \non the merits as to this claim.  Cf. Allaithi v. Rumsfeld, 753 F.3d 1327, 1334 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(“In this circuit, it is not enough merely to mention a possible argument in the most skeletal way, \nleaving the court to do counsel’s work[.]”). \nTo sum up, plaintiffs’ claim that the terminations are unconstitutional because HHS \nretroactively conditioned the grant awards lacks clear constitutional underpinning and is \notherwise underdeveloped.  Again, the burden rests on plaintiffs to make a “clear showing” on \nthe merits.  Chaplaincy, 454 F.3d at 297.  The Court thus concludes that plaintiffs have not at this \nearly stage made a sufficiently compelling showing to warrant preliminary relief on their \nSpending Clause claim.   \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 25 of 42\n3.  APA \nPlaintiffs additionally assert three claims under the APA, alleging that the termination \ndecisions are contrary to statute, contrary to agency regulations, and arbitrary and capricious.  \nUnlike plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, these three APA claims squarely implicate the Supreme \nCourt’s recent decision in Department of Education v. California because, as noted earlier, that \ncase exclusively involved claims under the APA.  See 145 S. Ct. at 968.  The Court therefore \nmust determine how, if at all, that decision changed the legal landscape surrounding plaintiffs’ \nAPA claims.   \nThe Court will take it from the top.  The APA generally permits a plaintiff to sue the \nUnited States to challenge agency action to obtain “relief other than money damages.”  5 U.S.C. \n§ 702.  There is, however, an exception to that broad waiver of sovereign immunity: “if any other \nstatute that grants consent to suit expressly or impliedly forbids the relief which is sought.”  Id.  \nThe D.C. Circuit has long held that the Tucker Act is one such statute.  Sharp v. Weinberger, 798 \nF.2d 1521, 1523 (D.C. Cir. 1986).  The Tucker Act, as discussed above, waives the federal \ngovernment’s sovereign immunity as to claims founded on contracts with the government.  28 \nU.S.C. § 1491.  Based on the Tucker Act’s separate consent to suit, the D.C. Circuit has held that \nthe APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not permit district courts to hear a case that is \nessentially contractual under the two-part test previously described that examines the source of \nthe right and the nature of the remedy sought.  See Crowley, 38 F.4th at 1106. \nThe Supreme Court, however, has not adopted this two-part test.  Nor has it held that the \nTucker Act requires that all contract claims go to the Court of Federal Claims regardless of the \ntype of relief sought.  As the D.C. Circuit has recognized, Supreme Court case law—and the text \nof both the APA and the Tucker Act themselves—might best be read to suggest that district \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 26 of 42\ncourts can grant equitable relief as to contract claims, while damages claims based on a contract \nmust go to the Court of Federal Claims.  See Transohio Savings Bank v. Director, Off. of Thrift \nSupervision, 967 F.2d 598, 611–13 (D.C. Cir. 1992), abrogated on other grounds as recognized \nin Perry Cap. LLC v. Mnuchin, 864 F.3d 591, 621 (D.C. Cir. 2017); id. at 613 (“Nothing in the \nlanguage of either the Tucker Act or the APA requires special treatment for contract claims.”).   \nWhat the Supreme Court has addressed is how to distinguish between money damages \nand equitable relief.  Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879 (1988), involved a dispute between \nMassachusetts and the federal government over a Medicaid reimbursement.  Medicaid, of course, \nis a cooperative federal program in which states agree to provide healthcare services to low-\nincome individuals and families.  Id. at 883.  In exchange, the federal government reimburses \nstates for approved healthcare expenses.  Id. at 883–84.  One year, HHS disallowed certain \nexpenses claimed by Massachusetts, finding them ineligible for reimbursement under an HHS \nregulation.  Id. at 886–87.  Believing it had been short-changed, Massachusetts sued HHS under \nthe APA, arguing that HHS had violated the Medicaid statute and HHS regulations.  Id. at 887.  \nThe district court sided with Massachusetts.  Id. at 888.  It exercised jurisdiction and entered an \norder setting aside HHS’s denial of reimbursement without directing payment of any specific \namount of funds.  Id.  The federal government argued before the Supreme Court that, because \nvacating HHS’s denial would lead to funds being paid to Massachusetts, Massachusetts was \nreally seeking money damages and therefore had to go to the Court of Federal Claims.  Id. at \n891. \nThe Supreme Court disagreed for two independent reasons.  Bowen, 487 U.S. at 909.  \nThe Court first held that an order setting aside a disallowance decision is not an order for a \n“money judgment.”  Id.  Of course, vacating a decision to withhold funds will likely lead the \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 27 of 42\ngovernment to pay up.  But to the extent that a court’s vacatur order does so, the payment of \nfunds “is a mere byproduct of that court’s primary function of reviewing the Secretary[ of Health \nand Human Services]’s interpretation of federal law.”  Id. at 910.  Next, the Court held that even \nif the district court had ordered payment of money, “such payments are not ‘money damages[.]’”  \nBowen, 487 U.S. at 910.  It explained that the district court’s order afforded “specific relief” in \nthat it “und[id] the Secretary’s refusal to reimburse the State[.]”  Id.  Money damages, on the \nother hand, “provide relief that substitutes for that which ought to have been done[.]”  Id.   \nThe upshot of the Supreme Court’s twin holdings in Bowen is this:  The Tucker Act does \nnot bar district courts from vacating the government’s decision not to pay funds just because the \ndistrict court’s order would result in, or even direct, the payment of money by the federal \ngovernment to the plaintiff. \nCourts in this district and elsewhere have grappled with whether the Tucker Act divests \ndistrict courts of jurisdiction in a raft of grant-termination cases that have been filed since \nPresident Trump returned to office.  One of the first of these cases was AIDS Vaccine Advocacy \nCoalition v. Department of State, No. 25-cv-400 (AHA) (D.D.C. filed Feb. 10, 2025), which \nchallenged President Trump’s decision to suspend federal grants for foreign-aid projects.  2025 \nWL 752378, at *3.  By statute, the federal government is required to issue grants for public-\nhealth projects in foreign countries.  Id. at *2.  After President Trump paused all foreign-aid \nspending, grant recipients sued the government, alleging that the funding pause violated the APA \nand constitutional separation-of-powers principles.  Id. at *3, 7.  The district court granted a \ntemporary restraining order enjoining the government from enforcing the pause in foreign-aid \ngrants and, after concerns about the government’s compliance arose, ordered the government to \n“unfreeze funds for work completed prior to the TRO[.]”  Id. at *4. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 28 of 42\nThe government sought a stay of that order—though not the underlying TRO itself—\nfrom the D.C. Circuit and then the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court, over the dissent of four \njustices, denied the stay request, explaining that because the district court’s compliance deadline \nhad passed, the district court “should clarify what obligations the Government must fulfill to \nensure compliance with the temporary restraining order[.]”  Dep’t of State v. AIDS Vaccine \nAdvoc. Coal., 145 S. Ct. 753, 753 (2025).  The Court did not otherwise address the stay factors, \nincluding whether the government was likely to succeed on the merits.  See id.  In dissent, \nJustice Alito opined that the district court likely lacked jurisdiction to issue the underlying TRO.  \nId. at 753 (Alito, J., dissenting). \nThe Supreme Court’s decision not to stay the district court’s order in AIDS Vaccine \nAdvocacy Coalition, together with Bowen, might suggest that a majority of the Court did not \nagree with Justice Alito on whether district courts have jurisdiction to vacate grant revocations or \npauses.  See, e.g., Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-5144, 2025 WL 1288817, at *10–14 (D.C. Cir. \nMay 3, 2025) (Pillard, J., dissenting) (discussing Bowen and AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition \nin another grant-rescission case).  Whatever the case, AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition is not \nthe Supreme Court’s most recent word in this area.  That would be Department of Education v. \nCalifornia.   \nThat case involved congressional statutes providing for grants to states for hiring, \ntraining, and supporting teachers in underserved areas.  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 970 \n(Jackson, J., dissenting).  In February, the administration terminated over 100 grants issued under \nthose laws.  Id. at 970–71.  It offered grant recipients a single paragraph of explanation that said, \nin essence, that the grants were no longer consistent with the administration’s priorities regarding \n“DEI initiatives.”  Id. at 971.  States then sued to challenge the rescissions.  The district court \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 29 of 42\ngranted a TRO, finding that the states were likely to succeed on their claim that the rescissions \nwere arbitrary and capricious because the one-paragraph explanation was too conclusory to \nsatisfy the APA.  California v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-10548 (MJJ), 2025 WL 760825, at *3 \n(D. Mass. Mar. 10, 2025).  The TRO required the government to restore the plaintiffs to the pre-\ntermination status quo and enjoined the government from enforcing the terminations.  Id. at *5. \nThe Supreme Court stayed the TRO.  Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 969.  In a brief order, \nthe Court explained that the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity does not extend to “orders to \nenforce a contractual obligation to pay money along the lines of what the District Court ordered \nhere.”  Id. (quotation marks omitted).  It also explained that the APA’s waiver does not apply \nwhen another statute gives the government’s consent to suit and pointed out that the Tucker Act \nvests the Court of Federal Claims with jurisdiction over contract suits.  Id. \nThe Supreme Court’s brief foray into the jurisdictional issue left many questions \nunanswered.  For one, it did not explain what distinguished this case from AIDS Vaccine \nAdvocacy Coalition.  It would seem that the jurisdictional barrier identified by the Court in \nDepartment of Education would also be present in that earlier case and should have required the \nCourt to grant the stay the government sought.  Justice Alito and three other justices thought as \nmuch at the time.  For another, the order did not identify what specifically was wrong with the \ndistrict court’s order or explain how the district court had impermissibly enforced a contractual \nobligation to pay money.  After all, the district court did not order payment of funds; it merely \nordered a return to the status quo and vacated a termination of funds.  And under Bowen, to the \nextent vacatur leads to payment of funds, that is merely a permissible byproduct of the court’s \nordinary judicial review.  See 487 U.S. at 910.  So perhaps the Court found dispositive the fact \nthat the states were suing over grants.  But as mentioned above, the Supreme Court has never \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 30 of 42\nadopted a test for identifying contractual claims or held that contract claims against the federal \ngovernment, even for prospective equitable relief, all must go to the Court of Federal Claims.  If \nthe Court meant to hold as much, it did not say so.  Finally, the Court did not address the fact that \nthe Court of Federal Claims cannot grant prospective equitable relief.  If grant recipients seek an \norder barring the administration from enforcing the grant rescissions going forward, are they \nsimply out of luck?  The Court gave no answer. \nPerhaps because of these unanswered questions, different judges have applied \nDepartment of Education in different ways.  At least one district court has denied preliminary \nrelief where a plaintiff failed to distinguish the case.  See Pippenger v. U.S. DOGE Serv., No. \n25-cv-1090 (BAH), 2025 WL 1148345, at *5 (D.D.C. Apr. 17, 2025).  At least four judges on \nthe D.C. Circuit appear to have suggested that Department of Education forecloses district-court \njurisdiction in grant-termination cases altogether.  See Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-5150, 2025 \nWL 1521355, at *2 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting, joined by Henderson, Rao, \nWalker, JJ.).  Other courts, by contrast, have distinguished Department of Education in some \nrespect.  Some have differentiated between the types of claims at issue.  As mentioned before, in \nABA, this Court explained that Department of Education did not discuss claims where the \nplaintiff’s asserted right comes from the Constitution.  2025 WL 1388891, at *6.  And in \nWidakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-cv-1015 (RCL), 2025 WL 1166400 (D.D.C. April 22, 2025), the \ndistrict court distinguished Department of Education on the ground that the Widakuswara \nplaintiffs’ rights came from a statute that expressly directed that funds be given as grants to \nspecific recipients.  Id. at *9.  A circuit judge drew a similar distinction, which the en banc D.C. \nCircuit later endorsed.  Widakuswara v. Lake, No. 25-5150, 2025 WL 1288817, at *13 (Pillard, \nJ., dissenting); Widakuswara, 2025 WL 1521355, at *1 (en banc) (per curiam) (agreeing with \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 31 of 42\nJudge Pillard “substantially”).  And finally, other district courts have declined to follow \nDepartment of Education even as to APA claims, reasoning that the Supreme Court’s \nunpublished order did not displace Bowen and governing D.C. Circuit law.  See, e.g., S. Educ. \nFound. v. Dep’t of Educ., No. 25-cv-1079 (PLF), 2025 WL 1453047, at *9 (D.D.C. May 21, \n2025). \nTo be clear, uncertainty over where to draw the jurisdictional line between the APA and \nthe Tucker Act is not solely a result of Department of Education.  Even before the Supreme \nCourt’s order, the test for whether a claim is essentially contractual was somewhat imprecise.  \nFor one, what should courts do when the source of the plaintiff’s right is part contractual and part \nstatutory or constitutional?  The D.C. Circuit has suggested, though not clearly held, that such \nclaims might be permitted to proceed in district court.  Transohio, 967 F.2d at 609 (“The answer \nto the sovereign immunity and jurisdiction questions depends on . . . [whether] plaintiffs’ claims \nare founded only on a contract.” (emphasis added)).  For another, what is the difference between \nordering the government to perform its contractual obligations and vacating the government’s \nrescission of a contract?  The former is generally not permitted, while the latter is a classic \nfunction of judicial review.  See Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. United States, 780 F.2d 74, 79–80 (D.C. \nCir. 1985) (discussing limitations on specific performance in cases involving government \ncontracts).  Moreover, as far as the Court is aware, the D.C. Circuit has not expressly addressed \nwhether the D.C. Circuit’s two-part test is meant to be conjunctive or disjunctive—that is, \nwhether the source of the right and the relief sought both must be contractual to deprive district \ncourts of jurisdiction, or if just one of the two does the trick.  Compare Crowley, 38 F.4th at \n1113 (claim belongs in the Court of Federal Claims if the “asserted right is based in contract and \n[the plaintiff] seeks . . . monetary relief” (emphasis added)) and ABA, 2025 WL 1388891, at *6 \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 32 of 42\n(contractual relief alone “is not enough”), with U.S. Conf. of Catholic Bishops v. Dep’t of State, \nNo. 25-cv-456 (TNM), 2025 WL 763738, at *5 (D.D.C. March 11, 2025) (the type of remedy \nalone “is dispositive”). \nGiven all this legal uncertainty, less is more.  The Court declines at this time to address \nplaintiffs’ contrary-to-statute and contrary-to-regulation claims under the APA because they are \nlargely duplicative of plaintiffs’ constitutional claims and are potentially foreclosed by \nDepartment of Education.  Those APA claims turn on what the underlying appropriations \nstatutes and regulations mean, issues the Court has already addressed when analyzing whether \nplaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits on their constitutional claims.  \nSo even if the Court were to reach the merits of these two APA claims, plaintiffs would not \nobtain any additional relief.  Untangling the competing strands of jurisdictional case law now, on \na limited preliminary-injunction record and when the governing law may well change in the \nmonths, weeks, or even days ahead, would therefore not be an efficient use of judicial resources.  \nCf. ABA, 2025 WL 1388891, at *4 (addressing only one of six claims where plaintiffs could \nobtain full relief based solely on that claim); Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & \nBudget, 763 F. Supp. 3d 36, 52–53 (D.D.C. 2025) (similar).9 \nPlaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim, however, is a different story.  The theory \nunderlying that claim is that terminating all the affected grants with a boilerplate, one-paragraph \nexplanation flubs the APA’s requirement that agencies adequately explain their decisions by \naddressing reliance interests, accounting for any changes in agency position, and weighing \n \n9 The Court began its analysis of plaintiffs’ likelihood of success on their constitutional \nclaims for similar reasons.  Should the case proceed to summary judgment, the Court will not \nhave that luxury.  See Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.S. 692, 705 (2011) (“[A] longstanding principle \nof judicial restraint requires that courts avoid reaching constitutional questions in advance of the \nnecessity of deciding them.” (quotation marks omitted)). \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 33 of 42\nalternative options.  See PI Mot. at 24–29.  Because the same explanation was offered as to all \nthe termination decisions, a finding by the Court that the government’s explanation was \ninadequate would apply across the board as to all the grant rescissions, including rescissions \nunder the American Rescue Plan Act and the Paycheck Protection Act, which the Court found \nlikely did not violate the separation of powers.  Accordingly, the Court must consider the merits \nof this claim to determine whether to grant plaintiffs the relief they seek, and therefore must also \ndecide whether it likely has jurisdiction over the claim. \nPlaintiffs have not shown a sufficient likelihood that the Court has jurisdiction over \nplaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim in light of Department of Education.  Like this case, \nDepartment of Education involved a statute that required the Executive Branch to issue grants to \nstate and local government entities for specified purposes.  145 S. Ct. at 970 (Jackson, J., \ndissenting) (describing the statutes authorizing the grants at issue).  Like this case, the Executive \nBranch terminated all those grants en masse with a boilerplate, one-paragraph explanation.  Id. at \n971 (reproducing the “single paragraph regarding the [agency’s] justification for the grant \ntermination”).  And like this case, the plaintiffs challenged that explanation under the APA on \nthe ground that one paragraph does not cut it.  Id. at 971, 975.  It was this claim that the Supreme \nCourt held likely belonged in the Court of Federal Claims:  A claim that appears in all material \nrespects identical to the one that plaintiffs press here.  Contrary to the government’s arguments, \nDepartment of Education is not binding authority.  See Lunding v. N.Y. Tax Appeals Tribunal, \n522 U.S. 287, 307 (1998) (explaining that summary actions “do not have the same precedential \nvalue as does an opinion of [the Supreme] Court after briefing and oral argument on the merits” \n(cleaned up)).  But when the highest court in the land answers the same question now before this \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 34 of 42\nCourt, in a similar preliminary posture and on facts materially identical to those in this case, this \nCourt cannot but listen. \nOne final point.  In the Colorado case proceeding parallel to this one, the District of \nRhode Island eschewed Department of Education and relied instead on Bowen to find \njurisdiction over APA arbitrary-and-capricious claims.  See Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *9.  \nThis Court respectfully disagrees.  While this case is similar to Bowen in many respects, it \ndiffers in that Bowen was not a contract case.  Bowen involved a statutory grant of Medicaid \nfunds made by Congress, rather than grant agreements made with executive-branch agencies like \nthe ones at issue in this case.  See 487 U.S. at 882–84 (describing the statutory payments at \nissue).  Perhaps that distinction should not be legally significant.  After all, the Supreme Court \nhas “repeatedly characterized . . . Spending Clause legislation” like Medicaid as “‘much in the \nnature of a contract.’”  Nat’l Fed’n of Indep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 576–77 (2012) \n(emphasis in NFIB) (quoting Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186 (2002)); Pennhurst, 451 U.S. \nat 17 (same); see also Bowen, 487 U.S. at 923 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (“The Medicaid Act itself \ncan be analogized to a unilateral offer for a contract—offering to pay specified sums in return for \nthe performance of specified services[.]”).  Still, the fact remains that Department of Education is \nthe case that speaks, however tersely, most directly to the issues and facts underlying plaintiffs’ \narbitrary-and-capricious APA claim.  Without further guidance from the Supreme Court or the \nD.C. Circuit or a meaningful distinction between plaintiffs’ arbitrary-and-capricious claim and \nthe one in Department of Education, the Court concludes that plaintiffs have not presently shown \na likelihood of success on this claim. \n* * * \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 35 of 42\nPlaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their separation-of-powers claim \nonly as to grants issued under the CPRSAA, CARES Act, and CRRSAA.  They therefore have \nalso demonstrated a likelihood of success on their ultra vires claim as to those three statutes.  \nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on their other claims.  The Court \nstresses, however, that its decision is “necessarily preliminary,” and based solely on the “limited \nrecord” currently before the Court.   Alpine Sec. Corp. v. FINRA, 121 F.4th 1314, 1330 (D.C. \nCir. 2024) (emphasis in original).  The Court leaves open the possibility that further development \nof the issues and the record in this case, on a less compressed timeline, might (or might not) \nimprove plaintiffs’ prospects. \nC.  Irreparable Harm \nNext, plaintiffs have established irreparable harm because the local governments will be \nforced to end public-health programming without grant funding and AFSCME’s members are \nbeing terminated without any means of compensation. \n1.  Local-Government Plaintiffs \nBegin with the local-government plaintiffs.  As courts in this district have held, a loss of \nfederal funding can cause irreparable harm when it “threatens the very existence of the \n[recipient’s] operations.”  ABA, 2025 WL 1388891, at *8 (cleaned up); see Climate United Fund \nv. Citibank, N.A., No. 25-cv-698 (TSC), 2025 WL 1131412, at *17 (D.D.C. Apr. 16, 2025) \n(“Obviously, when an organization is created to fulfill the objectives of a grant and its existence \nrelies on grant money, harm is certain once the grant funds are withdrawn.”).  Here, the local-\ngovernment plaintiffs have filed declarations explaining why the loss of federal funding \ncontinues to force them to lay off employees, cut public-health programming, and suspend other \noperations that the grants were intended to promote.  See Decl. of Jennifer Kiger ¶ 11 (Harris \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 36 of 42\nCounty forced to cancel its wastewater surveillance program for disease detection); Decl. of \nMarvia Jones ¶¶ 7, 10 (“Kansas City cannot presently afford to purchase the lab equipment” \nneeded to test for COVID-19, influenza, measles, sexually transmitted diseases, and other \ninfectious diseases); Decl. of Thomas Sharp ¶ 20 (Nashville was forced to suspend child \nvaccination outreach in private schools).  Those cuts will in turn make it harder for these \nplaintiffs to investigate, monitor, and respond to public-health threats.   \nFor example, Columbus, Ohio’s Department of Public Health had to lay off 11 public-\nhealth employees “charged with infectious disease tracing, investigations, and community \nresponse coordination” who were “preparing to investigate and address the current measles \noutbreak in Ohio” when the grants were terminated.  Johnson Decl. ¶ 17.  Following these \nlayoffs, Columbus Public Health “is operating at about twenty-five percent capacity for [its] \ndisease tracing and investigation work.”  Id. ¶ 19.  Furthermore, the loss of funding has \nprevented Columbus Public Health from upgrading its “out of date” data infrastructure system to \none used in “[m]ost hospitals and federally qualified health centers . . . to store patient records[.]”  \nId. ¶ 22.  Without the upgrade, Columbus Public Health will have a harder time accessing \nmedical records from other providers when treating patients in city-run clinics.  Id.  Losing the \ngrant funding has also forced Columbus Public Health to redirect resources from other priorities \nto compensate.  It has redeployed some nursing staff away from direct services to focus on \ninvestigating infectious diseases.  Id. ¶ 19.  And it has been forced to draw upon general funds to \ncover salaries for other employees funded by the now-cancelled grants, money that could be used \nfor other programs.  Id. ¶ 21.   \nSimilar costs and challenges now face all the local-government plaintiffs.  These burdens \ncannot be easily undone.  Even restoring all funding at a later date cannot make up for lost time \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 37 of 42\nthat would have been spent fulfilling plaintiffs’ public-health departments’ missions of \npreventing infectious disease.  See League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 9 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (finding irreparable injury where government action “ma[d]e it more difficult” \nfor organizations to “accomplish their primary mission of registering voters” and there was no \npossibility of a “do over”). \n2.  AFSCME \nAFSCME also faces irreparable harm because its declarations confirm that many \nAFSCME employees have already lost their jobs, with hundreds more at risk of job loss due to \nthe termination of federal funding to state and local governments.  See Heddings Decl. ¶ 9 \n(AFSCME member in Alaska terminated because of loss of grant funding); Hewitt Decl. ¶ 8 (16 \nAFSCME members in Alaska lost jobs following grant termination); Decl. of Amy Spiegel ¶ 11d \n(AFSCME in Washington State learned that 265 members were at risk of losing their jobs \nbecause of lost funding); Decl. of Shaun O’Brien (“O’Brien Decl.”) ¶ 7 (“Numerous individuals \nwho lost their jobs because HHS and the CDC swiftly and abruptly pulled promised funding are \nAFSCME members.”); Decl. of John Henry, Jr. ¶ 9 (Ohio informed eleven members of a \nAFSCME bargaining unit (at least some of which are also dues-paying members) that they \nwould be terminated).   \nTo be sure, loss of employment is typically not considered irreparable harm because a \nwrongfully terminated employee often can obtain retroactive relief such as backpay.  See Farris \nv. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76, 79–80 (D.D.C. 2006).  But job loss can be an irreparable harm \nwhere such remedies may be unavailable.  See, e.g., Am. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps., AFL-CIO v. \nUnited States, 104 F. Supp. 2d 58, 76 (D.D.C. 2000) (finding irreparable harm where plaintiffs \n“might be precluded from suing the federal government to recoup pay and benefits they lost” due \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 38 of 42\nto an allegedly unlawful termination).  Here, AFSCME members who lose their jobs due to \nfederal-funding cuts likely cannot sue the federal government to recover backpay or any other \nremedies.  That is because they are employed not by the federal government but by state and \nlocal governments, so any suit against the federal government for backpay or other damages \nwould likely be barred by sovereign immunity.  See Clark v. Lib. of Cong., 750 F.2d 89, 103 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984).  Nor does the government point to any other remedies that might be available \nto a terminated AFSCME member.  Accordingly, the Court concludes that AFSCME members \nwould suffer irreparable harm absent a preliminary injunction. \nD.  Balance of Equities and the Public Interest \nAs for the remaining preliminary-injunction factors, the central question is what, if any, \nrelief would be appropriate in light of the burdens upon others and the public interest.  The Court \nmust consider “what is necessary, what is fair, and what is workable[.]”  North Carolina v. \nCovington, 581 U.S. 486, 488 (2017) (quoting New York v. Cathedral Acad., 434 U.S. 125, 129 \n(1977)).  The Court will begin with the four local-government plaintiffs before considering the \nwisdom of the broader nationwide relief plaintiffs seek. \n1.  Local-Government Plaintiffs \nThe equities and public interest favor an injunction as to the four local-government \nplaintiffs.  One factor that weighs heavily in plaintiffs’ favor is that these funds were earmarked \nfor programs that promote the public health.  Such programs benefit not only those who live in \nplaintiffs’ jurisdictions but also those in surrounding areas.  For example, infectious diseases \nobviously can spread across county lines.  So the public has an interest in funding activities \naimed at minimizing the spread of such diseases.  See Banzhaf v. FCC, 405 F.2d 1082, 1096 \n(D.C. Cir. 1968) (“Whatever else it may mean, however, we think the public interest \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 39 of 42\nindisputably includes the public health.”); Nat’l Immigr. Proj. of Nat’l Laws.’ Guild v. Exec. \nOff. of Immigr. Rev., 456 F. Supp. 3d 16,34 (D.D.C. 2020) (“It goes almost without saying, of \ncourse, that promoting public health—especially during a pandemic—is in the public interest.”). \nOn the other hand, the federal government is rightly concerned about the potentially \nirrevocable loss of taxpayer dollars.  If plaintiffs are awarded preliminary injunctive relief, then \nthe government may be required to resume payments on plaintiffs’ grants.  But if plaintiffs were \nlater to lose on the merits or on appeal, then the federal government would be hard-pressed to get \nthose funds back.  See Dep’t of Educ., 145 S. Ct. at 968–69 (noting that the funding recipients \n“have not refuted the Government’s representation that it is unlikely to recover the grant funds \nonce they are disbursed.”).  Plaintiffs gesture at the possibility that HHS regulations might permit \nthe agency to offset any wrongfully paid out funds against other HHS grants plaintiffs hold.  See \nPI Mot. at 40.  But that possibility is too uncertain on this record to warrant much weight.  See \nOral Arg. Tr. at 41:4–10 (plaintiffs refusing to “commit to setting off any monies if ultimately \nthe government were to prevail on the merits”).   \nEven so, the Court finds that the potential burden on the public fisc is not sufficiently \ngreat here to deny the local-government plaintiffs preliminary relief.  At the time of the grant \nterminations, these four plaintiffs had approximately $32.7 million left on grants awarded either \ndirectly to them or via state pass-through entities.  Pls.’ Resp. Gov’t Suppl. Decl. at 2.  Plaintiffs \ndid not specify which statutes funded those grants.  See id.  But even assuming that all $32.7 \nmillion came from now-expired funds, that amount of money, while substantial, would be a \nrelatively small outlay for the federal government.  HHS was appropriated tens of billions of \ndollars to spend under the relevant appropriations laws and cancelled some $11 billion in \noutstanding grants.  Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *1.  The amount of money allegedly owed \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 40 of 42\nto plaintiffs is less than 0.5% of the amount of money cancelled.  And it is uncertain in any event \nthat the full $32.7 million would be paid out while the merits of this case are fully litigated.  As \nplaintiffs’ counsel represented at argument, these grants work on a reimbursement model, so \nplaintiffs would draw from them as they incur expenses.  Oral Arg. Tr. at 16:22–24. \nGiven the irreparable harm to the local-government plaintiffs, the significant public \ninterest in promoting the public health, and the relatively small financial burden on the federal \ngovernment, the Court finds that the equities favor granting a preliminary injunction to the four \nlocal-government plaintiffs as to any grants issued directly or indirectly to them under statutes \nwhose funding authorizations have now expired.   \nThe Court also exercises its broad discretion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(c) \nto decline to impose any bond for similar reasons.  What is a light burden to the federal \ngovernment would be a much heavier one to the cash-strapped local governments.  Requiring a \nbond to cover any wrongfully paid out grant funds therefore would largely undo the relief that \nthe Court finds is appropriate.  See Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. Off. of Mgmt. & Budget, No. \n25-cv-239 (LLA), 2025 WL 597959, at *19 (D.D.C. Feb. 25, 2025). \n2.  Nationwide Relief \nPlaintiffs also seek nationwide relief, primarily based on the theory that AFSCME has \nmembers all over the country who are affected by the grant terminations.  See PI Reply at 22–23.  \nThe Court finds that the equities and public interest do not support such a sweeping remedy. \nAt the outset, the Court notes that the District of Rhode Island issued injunctive relief as \nto 23 states and the District of Columbia.  See Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *24.  Any further \ninjunction from this Court is therefore unnecessary as to those states. \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 41 of 42\nNext, AFSCME’s declarations fail to establish the kind of diffuse, nationwide effects \nnecessary to justify such sweeping injunctive relief.  AFSCME submitted six declarations that \ndiscuss funding cuts in four places:  Alaska, Washington State, Jackson County, Ohio, and \nColumbus, Ohio.  Of those locales, two are or will soon be covered by more tailored injunctions:  \nWashington State was a plaintiff in the Colorado case, while Columbus, Ohio is a plaintiff here.  \nAccordingly, the effects of the grant cancellations in those two places do not provide any reason \nfor the Court to expand the scope of its injunction.  The remaining two jurisdictions are not \nenough either.  AFSCME reports that 23 members in Alaska and three members in Jackson \nCounty were laid off due to the funding terminations.  O’Brien Decl. ¶ 6a–b.  26 AFSCME \nmembers, almost all of whom are located in just one state, are not enough to warrant an \ninjunction as to 27 states and hundreds of municipalities across the country. \nThe government’s side of the ledger further counsels against broad nationwide relief.  \nAccording to plaintiffs, the government cancelled $11 billion in grant money nationwide.  While \na substantial portion of that is presumably subject to the Colorado injunction, the relief plaintiffs \nseek here could end up requiring the Executive Branch to disburse billions of dollars more.  To \nbe sure, HHS may well be required by statute to disburse those funds.  But that issue has not yet \nbeen finally resolved and is shrouded in considerable legal uncertainty, as explained above.  \nShould it turn out that the government is not required to pay out these grants, then the \ngovernment would likely be left without any means of recovering large sums of taxpayer money.  \nThat potential for irreversible error of such a large magnitude strongly counsels in favor of a \nlimited injunction that focuses only on the comparatively small amount potentially due to the \nlocal-government plaintiffs. \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-01275-CRC     Document 33     Filed 06/17/25     Page 42 of 42\nThe Court also will not cover Alaska or Jackson County, Ohio individually either.  \nNeither jurisdiction sued to recoup these funds, a decision that their elected officials were \nentitled to make for themselves and their constituents.  The Court will not override that decision \nlightly, especially given the uncertainty over the jurisdictional issues discussed above.  Should \nthe Court eventually hold the blanket grant rescissions unlawful, then the appropriate course may \nwell be for the Court to vacate those rescissions as to all grant recipients.  The APA, after all, \nrequires courts to “set aside” agency action found to violate it.  5 U.S.C. § 706(2).  But neither \nthe APA nor the equities require the extraordinary remedy of a hastily issued order that could \nlead the federal government to pay money to entities that have not asked for it.   \nThe Court therefore will deny plaintiffs’ motion to the extent it seeks relief beyond the \nfour local-government plaintiffs. \nIV.  Conclusion \nFor these reasons, the Court grants plaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction in part \nand denies it in part.  A separate Order follows. \n \n \n           \n  CHRISTOPHER R.
