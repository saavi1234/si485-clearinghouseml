    "summary": "<p>This case was a highly unusual federal criminal prosecution of a sitting state court judge&mdash;who was alleged by the Trump Administration to have interfered with an immigration arrest.</p>\r\n<p>On April 24, 2025, a federal grand jury in the Eastern District of Wisconsin indicted Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan on two counts: (1) obstruction of a federal administrative proceeding under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1505, and (2) concealment of a person from arrest under 18 U.S.C. &sect; 1071. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman and referred for pretrial matters to Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph.</p>\r\n<p>According to the indictment, Judge Dugan, while presiding over her courtroom in Milwaukee County Circuit Court on March 14, took steps to prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers' arrest of a noncitizen criminal defendant under an immigration detainer. Federal prosecutors alleged that she challenged the agents&rsquo; authority, directed them to speak with the chief judge, resumed the hearing off the record, and permitted the defendant to leave through a secure non-public exit. The government contended that these actions constituted deliberate obstruction of lawful federal enforcement efforts.</p>\r\n<p>Judge Dugan moved to dismiss the indictment on May 14. Represented by former U.S. attorneys and experienced criminal defense counsel, she argued that her alleged conduct was fully within the scope of her judicial duties and was protected by absolute judicial immunity. She contended that the charges violated the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers, the Tenth Amendment&rsquo;s federalism protections, and the longstanding principle that judicial acts&mdash;especially those involving courtroom management&mdash;cannot be criminalized. Her briefing drew heavily from <em>Trump v. United States (2024)</em>, where the Supreme Court held that the President cannot be prosecuted for official acts, and argued that the same logic applied to judges. She also invoked constitutional avoidance and argued that the relevant criminal statutes could not be construed to reach judicial conduct without raising serious constitutional questions.</p>\r\n<p>Amici curiae briefs were filed on both sides. A coalition of 138 former federal and state judges moved to support dismissal, emphasizing the risk of chilling judicial independence and public trust. They argued that courtroom decision-making must be insulated from criminal sanction, and that accountability for judges is properly handled through appeal or state judicial conduct commissions. In response, the Center for American Rights filed an amicus brief arguing that public officials&mdash;judges included&mdash;are not immune from prosecution for obstructing justice, and that allowing immunity here would set a dangerous precedent.</p>\r\n<p>On July 7, Magistrate Judge Nancy Joseph issued a Report and Recommendation that recommended that the court deny the motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 1870854. She concluded that no federal court had recognized absolute judicial immunity as a bar to criminal prosecution, rather than civil liability. While the alleged conduct may have occurred near or within the courtroom, she found that whether it was \"judicial in nature\" and immune from prosecution was not a question that could be resolved on the pleadings. The Report emphasized that judges have historically been held criminally liable for corruption or obstruction where warranted, citing precedents such as United States v. Claiborne and United States v. Joseph. She recommended that the case proceed to trial, with the motion to dismiss denied in full.</p>\r\n<p>On July 22, Judge Dugan filed objections to the Report and Recommendation, reiterating her constitutional arguments and asserting that the magistrate failed to address controlling authority on judicial independence. On July 29, the government filed its response, urging the district court to adopt the magistrate&rsquo;s recommendation and allow the case to proceed to trial.</p>\r\n<p>On August 26, 2025, the district court adopted the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation and denied Judge Dugan's motion to dismiss. 2025 WL 2452678. First, it rejected Judge Dugan's assertion of a general rule of immunity from criminal liability for judicial acts, agreeing instead with the government that \"there is no general rule of immunity, and what defendant calls exceptions are simply examples of the types of prosecutions that have been brought against judges.\" Even applying a more limited version of judicial immunity that shields judges from criminal liability for official acts taken in good faith, the court reasoned that viewing the facts alleged in the indictment in the light most favorable to the government, as required on a motion to dismiss, the defendant's alleged conduct would fall outside the scope of that more limited immunity.&nbsp; Rejecting, next, Judge Dugan's Tenth Amendment arguments, the court noted the absence of authority for the proposition that federal criminal statutes of general applicability cannot be applied to state court judges.&nbsp; It reasoned that the indictment did not purport to command or commandeer the defendant to participate in federal immigration enforcement but rather charged obstruction with those efforts under a statute of general applicability (and not one that targeted the states or state officials). Finally, the court rejected the defendant's constitutional avoidance argument related to alleged ambiguity in two of the words used in count two of the indictment, rejecting the assertion of ambiguity and noting that she did not propose a competing, plausible construction of those terms. Judge Dugan filed a motion to reconsider the decision on September 4, 2025.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On September 19, 2025, the Court addressed the parties&rsquo; proposed jury questionnaires. The Court first issued an order allowing the government to submit a questionnaire identifying the case, reasoning that identifying the case will promote judicial efficiency by allowing the Court to identify potential jurors who have already formed an opinion about the case and to dismiss them early. The Court next addressed Judge Dugan&rsquo;s proposal to include questions that touch on hobbies, activities, news sources, and politics. The Court indicated that given the particular circumstances of the case, it is appropriate to ask some questions about political issues to ensure a fair and impartial jury.</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "This case is about Wisconsin Circuit Judge Hannah Dugan, who was indicted by a federal grand jury in April 2025 for allegedly stopping ICE agents from arresting a noncitizen in her courtroom. She was charged with obstruction of a federal proceeding and concealing a person from arrest. Federal prosecutors claimed she interfered by questioning the agentsโ authority, directing them to speak with the chief judge, holding part of the hearing off the record, and letting the defendant leave through a secure exit.\r\n\r\nJudge Dugan argued she was just doing her job and was protected by judicial immunity, which means judges canโt be prosecuted for things they do officially in court. She said prosecuting her would hurt the independence of judges, and several former judges filed briefs agreeing with her. However, the government said public officials, including judges, can be prosecuted for breaking the law.\r\n\r\nA magistrate judge found thereโs no clear legal rule that judges are immune from criminal prosecution and recommended the case should go to trial. The district court agreed, saying even judges can face criminal charges if their actions go beyond their official duties or involve crimes like obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe court also discussed how to pick a fair jury, deciding to screen out potential jurors who already have strong opinions about the case, and to ask some questions about political beliefs because of the high-profile nature of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe case is still ongoing as of now.",

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nPlaintiff,\nv. Case No. 25-CR-89\nHANNAH C. DUGAN\nDefendant.\nDECISION AND ORDER\nDefendant Hannah Dugan moves to dismiss the indictment charging her with concealing\na  person  from  arrest,  18  U.S.C.  ยง  1071,  and  obstructing  removal  proceedings  of  the\nDepartment of Homeland Security, 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505. Summarized, the government alleges\nthat defendant, a state court judge, concealed from arrest and obstructed the apprehension of\na person wanted by federal immigration authorities for removal. The magistrate judge handling\npre-trial proceedings in this case issued a recommendation that the motion be denied.\nDefendant objects, requiring me to review the matter de novo. Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(b).\nI. THE INDICTMENT\nWhen considering a motion to dismiss, the court limits its review to the face of the\nindictment, assumes all facts alleged are true, and views the facts in the light most favorable\nto the government. See Boyce Motor Lines, Inc. v. United States, 342 U.S. 337, 343 n.16\n(1952); United States v. White, 610 F.3d 956, 958 (7th Cir. 2010); United States v. Yashar, 166\nF.3d 873, 880 (7th Cir. 1999). The parties have in their briefing related additional facts, but\nconsideration of those facts on a motion to dismiss would be improper. See United States v.\nYasak, 884 F.2d 996, 1001 (7th Cir. 1989). \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 1 of 27     Document 48\n\nThe indictment alleges:\nCOUNT ONE\nTHE GRAND JURY CHARGES THAT:\nOn or about April 18, 2025, in the State and Eastern District of Wisconsin,\nHANNAH C. DUGAN\nknowingly concealed E.F.R., a person for whose arrest a warrant and process\nhad been issued under the provisions of the law of the United States, so as to\nprevent the discovery and arrest of E.F.R., after notice and knowledge of the fact\nthat a warrant and process had been issued for the apprehension of E.F.R.\nIn violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1071.\nCOUNT TWO\nTHE GRAND JURY FURTHER CHARGES THAT:\nOn or about April 18, 2025, in the State and Eastern District of Wisconsin,\nHANNAH C. DUGAN\ndid corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct, and impede the due and proper\nadministration of the law under which a pending proceeding was being had\nbefore a department and agency of the United States, namely the administrative\narrest of E.F.R. for purposes of removal proceedings conducted by the United\nStates Department of Homeland Security, by committing affirmative acts to assist\nE.F.R. to evade arrest, including:\na)  confronting  members  of  a  United  States  Immigration  and  Customs\nEnforcement (ICE) Task Force and falsely telling them they needed a judicial\nwarrant to effectuate the arrest of E.F.R.;\nb) upon learning that they had an administrative warrant for E.F.R.โs arrest,\ndirecting all identified members of the ICE Task Force to leave the location\nof the planned arrest (a public hallway outside of Courtroom 615 of the\nMilwaukee County Courthouse) and go to the Chief Judgeโs office;\nc) addressing E.F.R.โs Milwaukee County Circuit Court criminal case off the\nrecord while ICE Task Force members were in the Chief Judgeโs office;\n2\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 2 of 27     Document 48\n\nd) directing E.F.R. and his counsel to exit Courtroom 615 through a non-\npublic jury door; and\ne) advising E.F.R.โs counsel that E.F.R. could appear by โZoomโ for his next\ncourt date.\nIn violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505. \n(R. 6.)\nII. DISCUSSION \nIn her motion, defendant argued that (1) she enjoys absolute judicial immunity for the\nofficial acts alleged in the indictment; (2) this prosecution violates the Tenth Amendment and\nthe Constitutionโs vertical separation of powers by intruding on the authority of state judges to\nmanage their own courtrooms and proceedings; and (3) ยงยง 1071 and 1505 should be construed\nso as to avoid the constitutional issues she raises. (R. 21 at 2.) The magistrate judge concluded\nthat, while the Supreme Court has granted judges immunity from civil liability, no such rule has\nbeen  established  in  the  criminal  context.  (R.  43  at  27-31.)  She  further  concluded  that\ndefendantโs  Tenth  Amendment  claim  required  the  assessment  of  disputed  facts  and\ncharacterization of the events underlying the indictment, which could not be done on a motion\nto dismiss. (R. 43 at 31-32.) Finally, the magistrate judge rejected the constitutional avoidance\nargument, as defendant identified no ambiguity in the charging statutes. (R. 43 at 32-34.)\nA. Immunity\nIn her objections, defendant begins with the proposition that every act alleged in the\nindictment is โโpart of a judgeโs job.โโ(R. 45 at 1, quoting the Report and Recommendation [R.\n43] at 30.) In other words, they are all โofficial acts.โ (R. 45 at 4; see also R. 47 at 3, โcore\njudicial actsโ.) She then posits that immunity is not restricted to the civil sphere; it protects\n3\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 3 of 27     Document 48\n\nagainst criminal liability for most official acts. (R. 45 at 3; R. 47 at 3.) She admits three\nexceptions to the general rule of judicial immunity: (1) wholly unofficial acts, e.g., a judge who\nmurders his wife in their home or who shares child pornography files on his own time; (2) graft\nor coercive sexual gratification, for which collateral judicial acts are the inducement or the\nthreat; and (3) official acts that deprive persons of their constitutional rights under statutes\nenacted pursuant to the Reconstruction Amendments, which abrogated judicial immunity. (R.\n45 at 3, 14-19; R. 21 at 13.)1 Defendant concludes that her case involves none of these\nexceptions: all of the acts alleged in the indictment were done in her capacity as a judge; the\nindictment alleges no graft or self-interest, such as a bribe or kickback in exchange for an\nofficial act; and there is no allegation that she violated individual rights protected by the\nThirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. (R. 45 at 20-21.) While the indictment does\nallege  that  defendant  โknowinglyโ  concealed  E.F.R.  and  โcorruptlyโ  obstructed  the\nadministration of law, she remains immune for the charged acts, as immunity operates to\nforeclose inquiry into motives. (R. 45 at 22; R. 47 at 1.)\nThe government responds that the Supreme Court has never recognized absolute\njudicial immunity from criminal liability (R. 46 at 5), and that defendantโs assumption of\nimmunity, subject to exceptions, wrongly inverts the analysis (R. 46 at 13). The government\nargues that defendantโs creation of categorical exceptions to immunity constitutes an attempt\nto explain away the many historical prosecutions of judges in a gerrymandered way, one which\nexcludes the conduct alleged here. (R. 46 at 13-14.) The government further contends that,\neven if a doctrine of immunity for judicial acts existed, the evidence in this case will show that\n1To be clear, in the objections defendant contends that the graft cases are really a\nsubcategory of the unofficial acts cases. (R. 45 at 16.)\n4\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 4 of 27     Document 48\n\ndefendant went well beyond her judicial role; instead, all events arose from her unilateral, non-\njudicial, and unofficial actions outside the role of a Wisconsin state judge by obstructing a\nfederal immigration matter over which she had no authority. (R. 46 at 15-16.) Although the\nmagistrate judge allowed that some of the allegations described conduct that could be\nconsidered part of a judgeโs job, she clarified that defendant was not being prosecuted for\nopining on the fly, managing her courtroom, or allowing someone to appear by Zoom; rather,\nthe indictment charged specific violations of federal criminal laws. (R. 46 at 18-19.) The\ngovernment concludes that defendant is not immune simply because she encountered federal\nagents while working at the courthouse. (R. 46 at 19.)\nThe dispute between the parties boils down to this: Defendant posits a general rule of\nimmunity, subject to certain exceptions which account for the previous (and legitimate)\nprosecutions of judges. According to the government, there is no general rule of immunity, and\nwhat defendant calls exceptions are simply examples of the types of prosecutions that have\nbeen brought against judges. A review of the relevant history reveals the government has the\nbetter of the argument.\nThe concept of judicial immunity is often traced to Floyd v. Barker, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305\n(Star Chamber 1607), where a judge who presided over a murder trial was hailed into a rival\ncourt and charged with conspiracy for his role. Lord Coke concluded that โa Judge, for any thing\ndone by him as Judge, by the authority which the King hath committed him, and as sitting in\nthe seat of the King (concerning his justice) shall not be drawn into question before any other\nJudge, for any surmise of corruption, except before the King himself[.]โ Id. at 1307. \nRelying on Floyd and similar English authorities, early American courts granted judicial\nimmunity in civil cases, although at times they stated the rule more broadly. E.g., Yates v.\n5\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 5 of 27     Document 48\n\nLansing, 5 Johns. 282, 291 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1810), affโd, 9 Johns 395 (N.Y. 1811) (โThe doctrine\nwhich holds a judge exempt from a civil suit or indictment, for any act done, or admitted to be\ndone by him, sitting as judge, has a deep root in the common law.โ); id. at 293 (โIn the case of\nFloyd v. Barker (12 Co. 23), the subject underwent a solemn consideration by Lord Coke, and\nall the judges; and their resolution was . . . that no judge, who tries and gives judgment in a\ncriminal case, or does any act in court, was to be questioned for it either at the suit of the party\nor of the king.โ); see also Hamilton v. Williams, 26 Ala. 527, 533 (Ala. 1855) (quoting the rule\nfrom Yates, 5 Johns. at 291).2\nThe Supreme Court first addressed the issue in Randall v. Brigham, 74 U.S. 523 (1869), \na case in which a lawyer filed a civil action against a state court judge alleging that the judge\nwrongly removed him from the state bar. Relying on Floyd, Yates, and other authorities, the\nCourt found the judge immune, stating: โ[I]t is a general principle applicable to all judicial\nofficers, that they are not liable to a civil action for any judicial act done within their jurisdiction.โ\nId. at 535. In Bradley v. Fisher, 80 U.S. 335, 347 (1872), also a civil action brought by a lawyer\nalleging wrongful removal from the bar by a judge, the Court, again citing Yates and Floyd,\nconcluded that a judge โcannot be subjected to responsibility for [a judicial act] in a civil action,\nhowever erroneous the act may have been, and however injurious in its consequences it may\nhave proved to the plaintiff.โ The Court continued: \n2As defendant notes, a recent civil case also stated the rule broadly. See Rockett v.\nEighmy, 71 F.4th 665, 669 (8th Cir. 2023) (โJudicial immunity continues to apply today, not only\nin prosecutions like Floyd, but in civil-rights actions brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.โ). In\nSpalding v. Vilas, 161 U.S. 483, 494 (1896), the Court quoted from Yates, 5 Johns. at 291, but\nthat case involved a claim of civil immunity by the Postmaster General, not a judge. As\ndefendant concedes in reply, these references are dicta. (R. 47 at 6.) But to be fair, some  of\nthe language relied upon by the government is too. I have considered all of the caselaw cited\nin deciding this motion.\n6\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 6 of 27     Document 48\n\nThe principle . . . which exempts judges of courts of superior or general authority\nfrom liability in a civil action for acts done by them in the exercise of their judicial\nfunctions, obtains in all countries where there is any well-ordered system of\njurisprudence. It has been the settled doctrine of the English courts for many\ncenturies, and has never been denied, that we are aware of, in the courts of this\ncountry. \nId. The Court also clarified that this exemption of judges from civil liability cannot โbe affected\nby the motives with which their judicial acts are performed. The purity of their motives cannot\nin this way be the subject of judicial inquiry.โ Id.\nIn Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), the Court granted immunity to a judge sued\nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 based on his involvement in a prosecution of civil rights protestors. The\nCourt explained:\nWe find no difficulty in agreeing with the Court of Appeals that Judge Spencer is\nimmune from liability for damages for his role in these convictions. The record is\nbarren of any proof or specific allegation that Judge Spencer played any role in\nthese arrests and convictions other than to adjudge petitioners guilty when their\ncases came before his court. Few doctrines were more solidly established at\ncommon law than the immunity of judges from liability for damages for acts\ncommitted within their judicial jurisdiction, as this Court recognized when it\nadopted the doctrine, in Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335 (1872). This immunity\napplies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly, and\nit โis not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the\nbenefit of the public, whose interest it is that the judges should be at liberty to\nexercise their functions with independence and without fear of consequences.โ\n(Scott v. Stansfield, L. R. 3 Ex. 220, 223 (1868), quoted in Bradley v. Fisher,\nsupra, 349, note, at 350.) It is a judgeโs duty to decide all cases within his\njurisdiction that are brought before him, including controversial cases that arouse\nthe most intense feelings in the litigants. His errors may be corrected on appeal,\nbut he should not have to fear that unsatisfied litigants may hound him with\nlitigation charging malice or corruption. Imposing such a burden on judges would\ncontribute not to principled and fearless decision-making but to intimidation.\nId. at 553-54 (footnote omitted).\nThe Court continued, in a number of subsequent cases, to afford judicial immunity in civil\nactions brought under ยง 1983, including some with egregious facts. See, e.g., Stump v.\n7\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 7 of 27     Document 48\n\nSparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978)  (immunity for order authorizing sterilization of a minor\nperformed under false pretenses); Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980) (judge civilly immune\nfor improperly issuing an injunction as part of an alleged conspiracy with other defendants,\nalthough the action could proceed against the other defendants, which may require the judge\nto testify and defend his judicial conduct); Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991) (immunity\ngranted where a judge, angered that a lawyer failed to appear in his courtroom, ordered the\npolice to forcibly and with excessive force seize and bring the lawyer into his courtroom). \nIn sum, then, a โlong line of [the] Courtโs precedents acknowledges that, generally, a\njudge is immune from a suit for money damages.โ Mireles, 502 U.S. at 9 (collecting cases).3\nโThe Court, however, has recognized that a judge is not absolutely immune from criminal\nliability, Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 348-349 (1880), or from a suit for prospective\ninjunctive relief, Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522, 536-543 (1984), or from a suit for attorneyโs\nfees authorized by statute, id., at 543-544.โ Id. at 10 n.1.4 \n3The  Court  has  explained  that  this  immunity  is  overcome  in  only  two  sets  of\ncircumstances. โFirst, a judge is not immune from liability for nonjudicial actions, i. e., actions\nnot taken in the judgeโs judicial capacity. Second, a judge is not immune for actions, though\njudicial in nature, taken in the complete absence of all jurisdiction.โ Id. at 11-12 (internal\ncitations omitted). The Court has also clarified that โimmunity is justified and defined by the\nfunctions it protects and serves, not by the person to whom it attaches.โ Forrester v. White, 484\nU.S. 219, 227 (1988). In other words, immunity does not attach simply because the defendant\nis a judge. The Court has drawn a โdistinction between judicial acts and the administrative,\nlegislative, or executive functions that judges may on occasion be assigned by law to perform.โ\nId. The former gain immunity, the latter do not.\n4The specific holdings of Pulliam have been superseded by statute. See Pub. L.\n104-317, ยง 309(c), 110 Stat. 3847, 3853 (1996) (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983)\n(โ[I]n any action brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officerโs\njudicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a declaratory decree was violated\nor declaratory relief was unavailable.โ); Pub. L. 104-317, ยง 309(b), 110 Stat. 3847, 3853 (1996),\n(codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. ยง 1988(b)) (โ[I]n any action brought against a judicial officer\nfor an act or omission taken in such officerโs judicial capacity such officer shall not be held\n8\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 8 of 27     Document 48\n\nIn Ex parte Virginia, a state court judge was charged with excluding Black persons from\ngrand and petit juries. 100 U.S. at 340. The charging statute provided that: \nno citizen, possessing all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by\nlaw shall be disqualified for service as grand or petit juror in any court of the\nUnited States, or of any State, on account of race, color, or previous condition of\nservitude; and any officer or other person charged with any duty in the selection\nor summoning of jurors who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen for the\ncause aforesaid shall, on conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor,\nand be fined not more than $5,000. \nId. at 344. In declining to grant habeas relief to the judge, the Court spent most of its opinion\ndiscussing Congressโs authority to enact the statute pursuant to the Thirteenth and Fourteenth\nAmendments. Id. at 344-48. At the end of the opinion, the Court briefly discussed immunity:\nIt was insisted during the argument on behalf of the petitioner that Congress\ncannot punish a State judge for his official acts; and it was assumed that Judge\nCole,  in  selecting  the  jury  as  he  did,  was  performing  a  judicial  act.  This\nassumption cannot be admitted. Whether the act done by him was judicial or not\nis to be determined by its character, and not by the character of the agent.\nWhether he was a county judge or not is of no importance. The duty of selecting\njurors might as well have been committed to a private person as to one holding\nthe office of a judge. It often is given to county commissioners, or supervisors, or\nassessors. In former times, the selection was made by the sheriff. In such cases,\nit surely is not a judicial act, in any such sense as is contended for here. It is\nmerely a ministerial act, as much so as the act of a sheriff holding an execution,\nin determining upon what piece of property he will make a levy, or the act of a\nroadmaster in selecting laborers to work upon the roads. That the jurors are\nselected for a court makes no difference. So are court-criers, tipstaves, sheriffs,\n&c. Is their election or their appointment a judicial act?\nBut if the selection of jurors could be considered in any case a judicial act, can\nthe act charged against the petitioner be considered such when he acted outside\nof his authority and in direct violation of the spirit of the State statute? That\nstatute gave him no authority, when selecting jurors, from whom a panel might\nbe drawn for a circuit court, to exclude all colored men merely because they were\nliable for any costs, including attorneyโs fees, unless such action was clearly in excess of such\nofficerโs jurisdiction.โ). However, the Courtโs consideration of common law immunity principles\nremains instructive, as defendant acknowledges. (R. 45 at 6-7; R. 47 at 5.) I discuss Pulliam\nfurther below.\n9\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 9 of 27     Document 48\n\ncolored. Such an exclusion was not left within the limits of his discretion. It is idle,\ntherefore, to say that the act of Congress is unconstitutional because it inflicts \npenalties upon State judges for their judicial action. It does no such thing.\nId. at 348-49.\nThe Court returned to the issue in OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488 (1974), a case in\nwhich the plaintiffs sought injunctive and equitable relief against a number of county officials,\nincluding two judges, alleging ongoing civil rights violations in the handling of criminal cases.\nThe Court held that the complaint failed to satisfy the case or controversy requirement imposed\nby Article III, id. at 493, and that granting relief would also result in unwarranted federal\nintervention into state proceedings, id. at 500. The Court concluded that the unavailability of\ninjunctive  relief  did  not  mean  federal  law  would  exercise  no  deterrent  effect  in  these\ncircumstances:\nJudges who would willfully discriminate on the ground of race or otherwise would\nwillfully deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights, as this complaint alleges,\nmust take account of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242. See Greenwood v. Peacock, supra, at\n830; United States v. Price, 383 U.S. 787, 793-794 (1966); United States v.\nGuest, 383 U.S. 745, 753-754 (1966); Screws v. United States, 325 U.S. 91,\n101-106 (1945); United States v.  Classic, 313 U.S. 299 (1941). Cf. Monroe v.\nPape, 365 U.S. 167, 187 (1961). That section provides:\nโWhoever, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, or custom,\nwillfully subjects any inhabitant of any State . . . to the deprivation of any rights,\nprivileges, or immunities secured or protected by the Constitution or laws of\nthe United States, or to different punishments, pains, or penalties, on account\nof such inhabitant being an alien, or by reason of his color, or race, than are\nprescribed for the punishment of citizens, shall be fined . . . or imprisoned . .\n. .โ\nWhatever may be the case with respect to civil liability generally, see Pierson v.\nRay, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), or civil liability for willful corruption, see Alzua v.\nJohnson, 231 U.S. 106, 110-111 (1913); Bradley v. Fisher, 13 Wall. 335, 347,\n350, 354 (1872), we have never held that the performance of the duties of\njudicial,  legislative,  or  executive  officers,  requires  or  contemplates  the\nimmunization of otherwise criminal deprivations of constitutional rights. Cf. Ex\nparte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880). On the contrary, the judicially fashioned\n10\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 10 of 27     Document 48\n\ndoctrine of official immunity does not reach โso far as to immunize criminal\nconduct proscribed by an Act of Congress. . . .โ Gravel v.

Judges are immune from ยง 1983\ndamages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens.โ).5 \n5While the statements in Dennis, Imbler, and OโShea could be deemed dicta, lower\nfederal courts have broadly denied criminal immunity to judges. See, e.g., United States v.\nClaiborne, 727 F.2d 842, 845 (9th Cir. 1984) (โ[T]he Constitution does not immunize a sitting\nfederal judge from the processes of criminal law.โ); id. at 847 (โArticle III protections, though\ndeserving utmost fidelity, should not be expanded to insulate federal judges from punishment\nfor their criminal wrongdoing.โ); id. at 848 (โWe . . . think it unlikely that judicial independence\nwould be measurably diminished by subjecting judges to the processes of criminal laws.โ);\nUnited States v. Hastings, 681 F.2d 706, 711 (11th Cir. 1982) (โIndeed, the miniscule increment\nin judicial independence that might be derived from the proposed rule would be outweighed by\nthe tremendous harm that the rule would cause to another treasured value of our constitutional\nsystem: no man in this country is so high that he is above the law. . . . A judge no less than any\nother man is subject to the processes of the criminal law.โ) (citing Dennis, Imbler, and OโShea);\nid. at 711 n.17 (โThe rule of absolute immunity from criminal prosecution of active federal\njudges for acts committed in their official capacities poses too great a threat to the public\ninterest in the rule of law to be adopted by this court.โ); United States v.

Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503\n(1974). Indeed, the judges here have been indicted by a federal grand jury for the conduct for\nwhich damages are sought in this case.โ). Cf. United States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 373\n11\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 11 of 27     Document 48\n\nThus, while the Court has declined to grant judicial immunity in the context of a criminal\ncivil rights violation,6 and cited 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 as an example of a statute that might be used,7\nthe Court has never suggested that judges are immune from prosecution for other crimes\ninvolving official acts. The Courtโs discussion in Pulliam further shows that the Court has not\naccepted a common law immunity rule as broad as defendant suggests. \nIn Pulliam, the plaintiffs obtained injunctive relief under ยง 1983, as well as costs and\nattorneyโs fees under ยง 1988, in an action brought against a state judge.8 466 U.S. at 524-25.\nThe Court surveyed the common law, drawing a parallel between the use of the prerogative\nwrits of mandamus and prohibition by the Kingโs Bench to control collateral and inferior courts\nin England, and the ability of federal courts in this country to grant injunctions against state\n(1980) (noting a similar rule for state legislators, drawing โthe line at civil actionsโ). While these\nwere bribery and kickback cases, I cannot accept defendantโs attempt to distinguish them from\nher situation, for the reasons set forth below. \n6Defendant argues that the Court in Ex parte Virginia essentially ducked the immunity\nissue, holding that the judgeโs acts were ministerial rather than judicial. (R. 45 at 13.) The Court\nitself has said the case did more than that. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 10 n.1; see also Pulliam, 466\nU.S. at 541 n.21 (โThe Court assumed that the judge was performing a ministerial rather than\na judicial function. It went on to conclude, however, that even if the judge had been performing\na judicial function, he would be liable under the statute. 100 U.S., at 348-349.โ).\n7Defendant states that Ex parte Virginia would have been better framed as a recognition\nof congressional power under the Reconstruction Amendments, an argument in keeping with\nher contention that prosecutions under 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 are the exception that proves the rule.\n(R. 45 at 12-13; R. 47 at 6.) As discussed in the following text, however, the Court has never\nsuggested that judges are immune from charges under other criminal statutes, and lower\nfederal courts have regularly held they are not, as noted above. The Courtโs citation of 18\nU.S.C. ยง 242, โthe criminal analog to ยง 1983,โ Imbler, 424 U.S. at 429, in cases like OโShea is\nbest understood, not as endorsing an exception to immunity, but reassurance that civil rights\nviolations will not necessarily go unpunished if judges are granted immunity from civil damages\nactions under ยง 1983. \n8As noted above, Congress later amended ยงยง 1983 and 1988 in response.\n12\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 12 of 27     Document 48\n\njudges. Id. at 535-36. The Court further concluded that permitting injunctive relief posed no\nsignificant threat to judicial independence, stressing the limitations already imposed by the\nrequirements for obtaining equitable relief against any defendant. Id. at 536-37.9 โAbsent some\nbasis for determining that such a result is compelled, either by the principles of judicial\nimmunity, derived from the common law and not explicitly abrogated by Congress, or by\nCongressโ own intent to limit the relief available under ยง 1983, we are unwilling to impose those\nlimits ourselves on the remedy Congress provided.โ Id. at 539-40. \nThe Court acknowledged its previous holding in Pierson, granting immunity from\ndamages actions under ยง 1983, but in that case the Court โsimply declined to impute to\nCongress the intent to abrogate common-law principles of judicial immunity. Absent the\npresumption of immunity on which Pierson was based, nothing in the legislative history of ยง\n1983 or in this Courtโs subsequent interpretations of that statute supports a conclusion that\nCongress intended to insulate judges from prospective collateral injunctive relief.โ Id. at 540.\nApparently, then, the presumption of immunity the Court acknowledged in Pierson extended\nno further than civil damages. \nFinally, the Court was unmoved by the dissentersโ complaint that injunctive relief carried\nwith it the threat of contemptโwith the possibility of a fine or even imprisonmentโwhich could\ndeter even the most courageous judge from exercising free and independent judgment. Id. at\n555 (Powell, J., dissenting); see id. at 538 n.19 (majority acknowledging that a judge risks\n9Of course, the requirements for obtaining a criminal conviction are even greater. See\nClaiborne, 727 F.2d at 848 (โFirst, aside from Article III safeguards, judges enjoy the same\nprotection  as  ordinary  citizens  do  from  vindictive  prosecution.

(R. 45 at 6.) The first is Commonwealth v. Tartar, 239 S.W.2d\n265 (Ky. Ct. App. 1951), where a judge was indicted for โwrongfully and corruptlyโ certifying a\nlist of grand jurors. While a state statute described the manner in which grand jurors were to\nbe selected, failure to comply was not made a statutory offense. Instead, the prosecutor argued\nthe judge committed the โcommon law offense of misfeasance in office.โ Id. at 266. The trial\ncourt sustained a demurrer to the indictment, and in a brief opinion the appellate court affirmed.\nThe court of appeals first noted that โjudges acting in their official capacities should be\nprotected from harassment by either civil suits or criminal prosecutions.โ Id. (citing Yates). The\ncourt then stated: \nWe believe the authorities are generally in agreement that misfeasance of a\njudicial officer, acting in his official capacity, did not constitute a criminal offense\nunder the common law. The reasons for such rule are sound, since otherwise\njudges  might  be  unduly  burdened  defending  charges  instigated  by  other\ngovernmental officers or aggrieved members of the public. \nId. \nIt is unclear whether the Tartar court found the judge immune or decided that the\nindictment failed to charge a common law offense against the judge. As the magistrate judge\nnoted, one commentator, after stating a general rule that โjudicial immunity does not exempt\njudges from criminal liability,โ in discussing Tartar stated:\nThe one area where judges can be said to enjoy immunity from criminal liability\nis  for  malfeasance  or  misfeasance  in  the  performance  of  judicial  tasks\nundertaken in good faith. In some states malfeasance or misfeasance in office\n14\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 14 of 27     Document 48\n\nis made criminal either by statute or common law rule. However, this criminal\nliability  will  be  precluded  by  judicial  immunity  unless  the  malfeasance  or\nmisfeasance is accompanied by bad faith.\nJeffrey M. Shaman, Judicial Immunity from Civil and Criminal Liability, 27 San Diego L. Rev.\n1, 18 (1990) (internal footnotes omitted).10 If this is indeed the rule, it is inapplicable here, as\ndefendant is not charged under a state statute or common law prohibition on malfeasance or\nmisfeasance in office but rather a federal criminal statute of general applicability. (R. 43 at 17.)\nAt all events, Tartar is a thin reed upon which to rest a claim of criminal judicial immunity,\nsubject to narrow exceptions. \nThe other case is United States v. Chaplin, 54 F. Supp. 926 (S.D. Cal. 1944), where a\njudge was indicted for conspiracy to deprive civil rights under a predecessor to 18 U.S.C. ยง 242. \nThe court, surveying caselaw dating back to England (and distinguishing Ex parte Virginia as\na case involving ministerial acts), agreed the judge was immune from prosecution. Id. at 928-\n33.  The cases upon which the court relied generally involved civil immunity. The Chaplin court\n10In a more recent article, Professor Combs states: โ[W]hereas American law provides\njudges absolute immunity against civil lawsuits, it provides no immunity whatsoever against\ncriminal prosecutions.โ See Nancy Amoury Combs, Redressing Judicial Misbehavior: An\nIntegrated Approach to Judicial Immunity, 58 U.C. Davis L. Rev. 1165, 1171 (2024); see also\nid. at 1174 (โ[T]he bottom line is that judicial immunity is bipolar. Judges are entirely shielded\nfrom  civil  money  damage  suits,  but  they  have  no  shielding  whatsoever  from  criminal\nprosecutions.โ);  id. at 1183 (โBy contrast, judges possess no immunity whatsoever from\ncriminal prosecutions.โ); id. at 1186 (โ[I]t is uncontroverted that the doctrine of judicial immunity\ndoes not shield judges from criminal liability for their judicial acts.โ) (citing Shaman, supra, at\n18-20; Samuel P. Stafford, An Overview of Judicial Immunity: Including Legal Representation\nof Judges, State Ct. J. 1, 4 (1977) (โIt is axiomatic that common law judicial immunity has never\nbeen extended to shield a judge from criminal liability.โ)). โThat said, somewhat tangentially,\nsome cases have held that the misfeasance of a judge, when acting in his official capacity,\ndoes not constitute a criminal offense.โ Id. at 1186 n.119 (citing Tartar). One federal court has\nsuggested,  citing  Tartar,  that  โthere  may  exist  a  common  law  immunity  from  criminal\nprosecutionโ for acts done in the judgeโs official capacity โundertaken in good faith.โ Hastings,\n681 F.2d at 711 n.17. I discuss this further below.\n15\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 15 of 27     Document 48\n\ndid cite Commonwealth v. Addison, 4 Dall. 225, 1 L. Ed. 810 (Pa. 1801), which involved a\ncriminal accusation against a judge,11 but the Addison court did not explicitly rely on immunity,\nstating, in full:\nWe  are,  unanimously,  of  opinion,  that  the  case  does  not  present  to  our\nconsideration an indictable offence; and, of course, it is not a case, in which an\ninformation ought to be granted. But we are (with the same unanimity) of opinion,\nthat every Judge has a right, and, emphatically, that it is his duty, to deliver his\nsentiments upon every subject that occurs in Court. We add, so far as the\nexpression of our sense of decorum may have weight, that we think, it would be\nindecent  and  improper,  in  any  presiding  Judge,  to  attempt  to  prevent  his\nassociates from the exercise of this right; from the performance of this duty.\nMotion refused. \nId.\nThe Chaplin court did make a strong policy argument that judges should be immune\nfrom criminal civil rights prosecutions, just as they are from civil damages actions:\nThe immunity which has clothed judges for a century and a half in our country\nfound  its  genesis  in  the  English  common  law  simultaneously  with  the\nindependence of the judiciary. The disappointed litigant cannot embarrass the\njudge in a civil action for damages irrespective of the justice of his decision, nor\ncan a defendant upon whom sentence has been pronounced, recover damages\nagainst the judge for the real or supposed wrong. A decision in favor of the\nGovernment in the instant criminal actions would place the official action of every\njustice of the peace, municipal or city court judges, Superior Court Judges,\nAppellate Court judges and Supreme Court judges in our country at the mercy of\na United States Attorney. Every sentence imposed on a defendant would be\nsubject to review by the representative of the Department of Justice, and if, in the\njudgment of the Attorney General of the United States or the United States\nAttorney for the District, the decision deprived the defendant of his civil rights, the\njudge could be indicted, tried, and, if convicted, punished. Every defendant\nsentenced to the county jail or the penitentiary is deprived of his civil rights, and\n11In Addison, the attorney general made a motion for a rule to show cause why an\ninformation should not be granted against the defendant, the President of the Courts of\nCommon Pleas, on the affidavit of J.C. Lucas, an associate Judge of the Court of Common\nPleas of Allegheny county, stating that he had been wilfully prevented by Judge Addison from\ndelivering his sentiments to the grand jury. Id.\n16\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 16 of 27     Document 48\n\nin many instances the civil rights are not revived upon release. The same\nreasoning would apply to our Federal Courts. To sustain the Governmentโs\ncontention would be to destroy the independence of the judiciary and mark the\nbeginning of the end of an independent and fearless judiciary. No doubt unjust\ndecisions have been rendered and individuals have suffered damage, and others\nhave been unjustly imprisoned, while a few innocent men have suffered the\ndeath penalty as the result of a juryโs verdict. No judicial system yet devised by\nman is perfect. The rich tradition, the long line of decisions, the confidence of our\npeople in the state and federal judiciary, the experience of over a century and a\nhalf expressed in our legal lore, coextensive with our national existence, cannot\nbe ignored in deciding this issue. The house should not be burned to destroy the\nmouse. To sustain the Governmentโs contention would invite similar actions\nagainst grand and petit jurors, prosecuting attorneys and attorneys representing\nclients before our courts and juries, now immune.\nId. at 933-34.\nSignificant as those concerns might be, it is hard to square Chaplin with subsequent\ncases like OโShea, 414 U.S. at 503 (โJudges who would willfully discriminate on the ground of\nrace or otherwise would willfully deprive the citizen of his constitutional rights, as this complaint\nalleges, must take account of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242.โ), and Imbler, 424 U.S. at 429 (โEven judges,\ncloaked with absolute civil immunity for centuries, could be punished criminally for willful\ndeprivations of constitutional rights on the strength of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242, the criminal analog of\nยง 1983.โ), as the magistrate judge noted. (R. 43 at 18.) Indeed, even defendant acknowledges\nthat judges are not immune from prosecution for official acts under civil rights laws. In sum,\nthen, Chaplin also provides little support for defendantโs contention here.\nFinally, defendant appeals to the recent decision in Trump v. United States, 603 U.S.\n593 (2024), where the Supreme Court held the President is entitled to absolute immunity from\ncriminal prosecution when exercising his core constitutional powers, and at least presumptive\nimmunity for all his official acts. Defendant contends that the Court relied on judicial immunity\ncases for official acts, extending to the President what judges had first. (R. 45 at 3.) The Trump\n17\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 17 of 27     Document 48\n\ndecision relied primarily on the Presidentโs โunique position in the constitutional scheme, as the\nonly person who alone composes a branch of government.โ Id. at 610 (internal citation and\nquote marks omitted). The Court concluded, based on separation of powers principles, that\nimmunity  was  required  to  safeguard  the  independence  and  effective  functioning  of  the\nExecutive Branch, and to enable the President to carry out his constitutional duties without\nundue caution. Id. at 614. These same concerns do not arise when one of the nationโs many\njudges is subject to prosecution. Further, while the Court relied on its previous decision in Nixon\nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982), granting the President immunity from civil damages actions,\na decision which in turn cited Pierson v. Ray, the Court said nothing about criminal immunity\nfor judicial acts.\nUltimately, as the Supreme Court has stated, โthe official seeking absolute immunity\nbears the burden of showing that such immunity is justified for the function in question.โ Burns\nv. Reed, 500 U.S. 478, 486 (1991);12 see also Antoine v. Byers & Anderson, 508 U.S. 429, 432\n(1993) (โThe proponent of a claim to absolute immunity bears the burden of establishing the\njustification for such immunity.โ). Defendant has not done so here.13\n12โWe have been quite sparing in our recognition of absolute immunity, and have refused\nto extend it any further than its justification would warrant.โ Id. at 487 (internal citation and\nquote marks omitted). \n13In her objections reply, defendant argues that, under Pulliam, โthe burden is not on\n[her] to demonstrate that Congress or the United States Supreme Court created judicial\nimmunity in criminal cases. The burden is on the government to show that the original criminal\njudicial immunity has been abrogated.โ (R. 47 at 5.) However, this assumes courts in this\ncountry have accepted a common law rule of criminal judicial immunity in the first place; as\ndiscussed above, they have not. See Combs, supra, at 1174 (โ[T]he bottom line is that judicial\nimmunity is bipolar. Judges are entirely shielded from civil money damage suits, but they have\nno shielding whatsoever from criminal prosecutions.โ). Defendant argues that the reasons for\njudicial immunity are stronger in the criminal context. (R. 45 at 8-10; R. 47 at 9.) It is true that\nthe consequences for a judge, if criminally convicted, will likely be greater than if she is found\n18\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 18 of 27     Document 48\n\nThis is not to gainsay the very real concerns defendant raises. She wonders why, if\nofficial acts enjoy no immunity, a judge could not be prosecuted for handling contraband during\na trial or scheduling a hearing in a manner that inconveniences federal law enforcement\nofficers.14 (R. 45 at 2; R. 47 at 10-11.) Saying โthat is not the way the criminal justice system\noperatesโ (R. 46 at 22), and that as a matter of โcommon-senseโ operatives in the system\nwould not violate the criminal law if they โare in good faith carrying out their required dutiesโ (R.\n46 at 23), as the government does, is unsatisfying.\nAs the Eleventh Circuit noted in permitting the prosecution of a judge for bribery, โthis\ncivilly liable. And, while a public employee can be indemnified for a damages judgment, one\ncannot shift to an insurer the loss of liberty that comes with a criminal conviction. However, as\nProfessor Combs explains, โcriminal prosecutions and civil suits differ in key ways,โ and โthese\ndifferences go a long way toward justifying the current doctrinal dichotomy.โ Combs, supra, at\n1217. โ[C]ivil suits present a greater threat to judges than criminal prosecutions both because\njudges are far more likely to be the target of a meritless civil suit than a meritless criminal\nprosecution and because the risk of a judgment against the judge is higher for a civil suit. Thus,\nbecause civil suits present a greater threat, immunity from these suits provides greater benefits,\nincluding to the value of judicial independence.โ Id. First, disappointed private litigants are far\nmore likely to bring a civil suit against a judge than a prosecutor is to launch a criminal\nprosecution. Id. at 1219. Second, a far broader range of harms are compensable as civil\nwrongs than are punishable as crimes. Id. at 1223. Third, it is easier for a plaintiff to win a civil\ncase than it is for a prosecutor to secure a conviction on the same facts, given the different\nburden of proof. Id. at 1223-24. Finally, โcivil tort suits exist primarily to recompense individual\nvictims who have suffered harm whereas criminal prosecutions not only vindicate the rights of\nindividual victims but also society as a whole. . . . Consequently, immunity from criminal\nprosecution imposes costs not just on the individual victim of the judgeโs wrongful act but also\non the larger community.โ Id. at 1225-26. Defendant concedes that the Supreme Court has\nnever had occasion to apply judicial immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts outside\nthe context of civil rights protected by the Reconstruction Amendments. But this is so, she\ncontends, because prosecutions like this one have so rarely been attempted. (R. 45 at 10-11;\nR. 47 at 8.) The particulars of this case may be unusual; nevertheless, as discussed above and\nin the magistrate judgeโs recommendation, there is no firmly established judicial immunity\nbarring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. (R. 43 at 27.)\n14Or, in a hypothetical closer to the mark, could a state court judge be prosecuted for\nobstruction if she remands an undocumented person into custody to answer for state charges,\nthereby thwarting a planned arrest and removal by federal immigration agents? \n19\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 19 of 27     Document 48\n\nis not a case in which a judge is prosecuted for acts in his official capacity undertaken in good\nfaith. In such a case, there may exist a common law immunity from criminal prosecution.โ\nHastings, 681 F.2d at 711 n.17 (citing Braatelien v. United States, 147 F.2d 888, 895 (8th Cir.\n1945); Commonwealth v. Tartar, 239 S.W.2d 265, 266 (Ky. App.1951)).15 But this leads to the\ngovernmentโs fallback position, that defendant is not being prosecuted for official acts in the\nordinary course of her duties. (R. 46 at 15.) Instead, the government contends, the events\nalleged in the indictment arose from her unilateral, non-judicial, and unofficial actions outside\nthe role of a state court judge. (R. 46 at 16.) While it would be improper to consider facts\noutside the four corners of the indictment on a motion to dismiss, viewing the facts that are\nalleged in the light most favorable to the government, as I must at this stage, and accounting\nfor  the  indictmentโs  allegation  that  defendant  โknowingly  concealedโ  E.F.R.  and  acted\nโcorruptly,โ I cannot say as a matter of law that defendantโs alleged conduct falls within even\nthis more limited version of immunity. See United States v. Joseph, No. 19-cr-10141, 2020 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 132387, at *8 (D. Mass. July 27, 2020) (โOf course, any such immunity, if it exists,\nwould never shield corruption or bribery. Where the Indictment charges that Joseph acted\nโcorruptly,โ it is not within this Courtโs province on a motion to dismiss to determine whether\njudicial immunity, even if its reach encompasses criminal liability, provides a viable shelter for\nJoseph in the circumstances alleged here.โ) (internal citations and quote marks omitted).\n15In Braatelien, the court stated โthat as a general rule a judge cannot be held criminally\nliable for erroneous judicial acts [d]one in good faith. 30 Am. Jur., Judges, 52. But he may be\nheld criminally responsible when he acts fraudulently or corruptly. Judicial title does not render\nits holder immune to crime even when committed behind the shield of judicial office.โ 147 F.2d\nat 895. However, the court denied the defendantโs immunity claim on factual grounds, stating:\nโBraatelien was not indicted for an erroneous or wrongful judicial act. . . .The crime charged is\ndistinct from his official acts. It might have been consummated without the performance of a\nsingle judicial act on his part.โ Id. \n20\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 20 of 27     Document 48\n\nThere is no basis for granting immunity simply because some of the allegations in the\nindictment describe conduct that could be considered โpart of a judgeโs job.โ As the magistrate\njudge noted, the same is true in the bribery prosecutions, concededly valid, where the judges\nwere  prosecuted  for  performing  official  acts  intertwined  with  bribery.  (R.  43  at  29-30.)\nDefendant argues that the gravamen of the offense in such cases is accepting the bribe (an\nunofficial act), with the collateral official act done in response presented as an evidentiary detail\nto complete the story. (R. 45 at 16-20.) The cases do not support this distinction.16 See\nHastings, 681 F.2d at 707 (โIn this case we are asked to decide whether an active federal judge\ncan be subject to federal criminal prosecution for acts involving the exercise of his judicial\nauthority.โ); Wallace, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 109163, at *35, *40-41 (holding that a judge had\ncivil but not criminal immunity for his โjudicial actsโ of sentencing juveniles to detention).17 Or\nas the government puts it, a judge may use judicial acts or tools as the means to accomplish\nan unlawful end.18 (R. 46 at 21.) Finally, to the extent defendant argues this category of cases\n16As defendant notes, Justice Barrett discussed this issue in her partial concurrence in\nTrump. (R. 45 at 18; R. 47 at 9.) However, her views did not carry the day. In any event, for the\nreasons stated above, Trump is inapposite.\n17Professor Combs notes that a few cases suggest criminal acts somehow cease to be\njudicial acts. However, the earliest example, Braatelien, discussed in note 15 above, involved\na situation where the defendantโs criminal acts were โdistinct from his judicial acts.โ Combs,\nsupra, at 1195-96. โFortunately, only a few courts implied that criminal judicial acts somehow\nceased to be judicial acts. Moreover, even when that rationale has appeared, it has typically\nbeen paired with the primary rationale that courts invoke when rejecting immunity for judicial\ncrimes: namely, a summary cost-benefit analysis that is deemed to weigh against immunity for\ncrimes.โ Id. at 1196.\n18It is also worth noting that the question is not whether the charged acts are โpart of a\njudgeโs job.โ As the Supreme Court has made clear, judges enjoy immunity from civil damages\nactions for their โjudicial acts,โ but not for โthe administrative, legislative, or executive functions\nthat judges may on occasion be assigned by law to perform.โ Forrester, 484 U.S. at 27.\n21\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 21 of 27     Document 48\n\nrequires the judge act for the purpose of self-enrichment or gratification, she provides no\nauthority for the proposition that the motive must be financial to be โcorrupt.โ And to the extent\ndefendant contends a court cannot inquire into the judgeโs motive for judicial acts, the same\ncould be said in the bribery cases. Accordingly, even if a more limited version of judicial\nimmunity exists, it does not support dismissal of the instant indictment.\nB. Tenth Amendment\nIn the objections, defendant contends that the magistrate judge missed the importance\nof the Tenth Amendment here; she argues that, outside the context of the Reconstruction\nAmendment enforcement clauses, Congress lacks authority to punish criminally the official acts\nof state judges. (R. 45 at 22; R. 47 at 13.) However, defendant cites no authority for the\nproposition that federal criminal statutes of general applicability may not be applied to state\ncourt judges, as alleged in the instant indictment.\nIt is true that the Constitution establishes a system of โdual sovereignty.โ Printz v. United\nStates, 521 U.S. 898, 918 (1997). Although the states surrendered many of their powers to  the\nnew federal government, they retained a residual and inviolable sovereignty, which is reflected\nin various provisions of the Constitution, including the Tenth Amendment. Id. at 918-19. And\nthe Supreme Court has enforced limitations on the federal governmentโs ability to intervene in\nstate affairs. But none are plainly applicable here.19 For instance, the indictment in no way\n19Defendant cites Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446, 447-48 (1923), where the\nCourt held that a party was exempt from service of process initiating a federal action while\nattending a state court hearing. (R. 45 at 25.) While the Court noted โthe necessities of the\njudicial administration,โ in which federal and state courts have โequal interest,โ id. at 448, I see\nnothing in the decision imposing a Tenth Amendment barrier to the instant prosecution. In a\ncase closer to the mark, the Supreme Court declined to recognize an evidentiary privilege\nbarring the introduction of evidence of the legislative acts undertaken by a state senator in\nexchange for bribes. Gillock, 445 U.S. at 361-62. The Court first concluded that the separation\n22\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 22 of 27     Document 48\n\nsuggests that the federal government may commandeer state judges into assisting in the\nenforcement of federal immigration law. Cf. Printz, 521 U.S. at 935. Nor does the indictment\nassert federal power to superintend the daily functioning of state courts. (R. 45 at 24-25; R. 47\nat 12.) Whether this case involves the routine work of a state court and judge, as defendant\ncontends (R. 45 at 26), or whether defendant added extraneous activities to her usual duties\nin order to defeat enforcement of federal immigration law, as the government alleges (R. 46 at\n19, 25), is not something that can be decided on a motion to dismiss. See Joseph, 2020 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 132387, at *10 (โAt bottom, the defendantsโ constitutional arguments require the\nassessment of disputed facts, characterizations of the events underlying the Indictment, or\nother evidentiary analysis.โ). \nThat state law permits discipline of judges for ethical violations, as defendant notes (R.\n45 at 26), does not preclude the bringing of federal criminal charges. Cf. Hastings, 681 F.2d\nat 709 (rejecting the argument โthat Congress has the exclusive primary jurisdiction to try and\npunish a federal judge for high crimes and misdemeanors through the impeachment processโ);\nof powers doctrine gave no support to the grant of a privilege to state legislators in federal\ncriminal prosecutions. While the federal government has limited powers with respect to the\nstates, โin those areas where the Constitution grants . . . the power to act, the Supremacy\nClause dictates that federal enactments will prevail over competing state exercises of power.โ\nId. at 370; see also United States v. Schock, 891 F.3d 334, 337 (7th Cir. 2018) (โNeither the\nseparation of powers generally, nor the Rulemaking Clause in particular, establishes a personal\nimmunity from prosecution or trial. The separation of powers is about the allocation of authority\namong the branches of the federal government. It is an institutional doctrine rather than a\npersonal one.โ). The Court further concluded that โGillockโs argument, resting on the Tenth\nAmendment, has no special force with regard to state legislators; on the rationale advanced,\nstate executive officers and members of the state judiciary would have equally plausible claims\nthat the denial of an evidentiary privilege to them resulted in a direct federal impact on\ntraditional state governmental functions.โ Gillock, 445 U.S. at 371; see also id. at 373 (โWe\nconclude, therefore, that although principles of comity command careful consideration, our\ncases disclose that where important federal interests are at stake, as in the enforcement of\nfederal criminal statutes, comity yields.โ). \n23\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 23 of 27     Document 48\n\nIsaacs, 493 F.2d at 1140-41 (rejecting the argument that impeachment, rather than criminal\nconviction, is the only means of removing a judge from office). Nor does one indictment against\none judge result in the usurpation of Wisconsinโs power to select, discipline, and remove its\nown judges. (R. 45 at 27.) Defendant cites Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991), where the\nCourt declined to apply the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to Missouri state court\njudges absent a clear statement that Congress intended to interfere with the stateโs power to\ndefine the qualifications of its own officials. (R. 45 at 27; R. 47 at 13.) Again, permitting this\nprosecution to proceed poses no similar threat to Wisconsinโs sovereignty. Cf. Gillock, 445 U.S.\nat 371 (holding that denial of an evidentiary privilege to a state legislator prosecuted for federal\ncrimes was not analogous to a direct regulation of state employee wages). Nor does defendant\ncite any authority for the proposition that a clear statement from Congress is needed before a\ncriminal statute of general applicability may be applied to a state official. (R. 47 at 13.) \nIn reply, defendant cites the recent decision in United States v. Illinois, No. 25 CV 1285,\n2025 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 142735 (N.D. Ill. July 25, 2025), where the court dismissed the\ngovernmentโs complaint against the state of Illinois and various local entities and officials\nchallenging so-called โsanctuary policies.โ (R. 47 at 13-14.) The court noted that the term\nโsanctuary policiesโ is a misnomer, as none of them immunized anyone to the reach of the\nfederal government. Instead, they generally prohibited state and local government support of\ncivil immigration activities, e.g., complying with detainers, giving immigration agents information\nabout non-citizens. Id. at *5-6. The government claimed that these policies were designed to\nand in fact interfered with the governmentโs enforcement of federal immigration law. Id. at *7.\nThe  court  engaged  in  a  wide-ranging  discussion  of  preemption  and  inter-governmental\nimmunity, ultimately concluding that the sanctuary policies reflected the defendantsโ decision\n24\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 24 of 27     Document 48\n\nnot  to  participate  in  enforcing  civil  immigration  law,  a  decision  protected  by  the  Tenth\nAmendment and the anti-commandeering doctrine. Id. at *76. As indicated above, the instant\nindictment commands no one to participate in federal immigration enforcement; rather, it\ncharges obstruction with those efforts pursuant to a statute of general applicability (not one\nregulating states and their political subdivisions, as in the cited case, see id. at *43).\nC. Avoidance  \nFinally, in the objections defendant alleges ambiguity in the terms โcorruptlyโ and\nโproceedingโ used in count two. (R. 45 at 27.) Presumably, the court would construe these\nterms such that ยง 1505 does not apply to the conduct alleged, avoiding the need to determine\nwhether the federal government could, consistent with the Tenth Amendment, use ordinary\ncriminal statutes to target state judicial acts. (See R. 47 at 14-15.)\nThe canon of constitutional avoidance comes into play only when, after the application\nof ordinary textual analysis, a statute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction;\nthe canon functions as a means of choosing between them so as to avoid constitutional\nconcerns. Clark v. Suarez Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 385 (2005). In other words, the canon is a\ntool  for  choosing  between  competing  plausible  interpretations  of  a  provision;  it  has  no\napplication in the absence of ambiguity. Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 50 (2014).\nDefendant cites no case finding these terms, as used in 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505 and further\ndefined in 18 U.S.C. ยง 1515(b), ambiguous. Instead, she relies on Snyder v. United States, 603\nU.S. 1, 5 (2024), where the Court held that 18 U.S.C. ยง 666โwhich makes it a crime for state\nand local officials to โcorruptlyโ solicit, accept, or agree to accept โanything of value from any\nperson, intending to be influenced or rewardedโ for an official actโcovered bribes but not\ngratuities. As part of its analysis, the Court did note federalism concerns with a more expansive\n25\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 25 of 27     Document 48\n\nconstruction  of  the  statute,  as  state  and  local  governments  had  adopted  a  variety  of\napproaches to regulating their officialsโ acceptance of gratuities. Id. at 14-15. The Court also\nhad fair notice concerns, as the government did not โidentify any remotely clear lines separating\nan innocuous or obviously benign gratuity from a criminal gratuity.โ Id. at 16. The Court declined\nto rely on the governmentโs promise that federal prosecutors could be trusted not to enforce\nthe statute against small-time violators. Id. at 17.\nAs noted, however, the issue in Snyder was whether ยง 666 covered gratuities as well as\nbribes. The Court did not find the term โcorruptlyโ to be ambiguous.20 Nor did the Court address\nthe canon of constitutional avoidance. Moreover, as the government notes, defendant cites no\nauthority for this court to decide non-constitutional statutory interpretation questions on a\nmotion to dismiss. (R. 46 at 28.) Finally, even if it would be appropriate to address the issue\nnow, defendant posits no competing, plausible construction of the statutory terms. (R. 46 at 28.)\nRather, the issues she raises regarding whether the conduct alleged is covered by the statutes\nare properly addressed at trial.21 \n20To the extent the Court considered the term, it did so in concluding that ยง 666 is a\nbribery statute. Id. at 11-12 (โTherefore, the dividing line between ยง201(b)โs bribery provision\nand ยง201(c)โs gratuities provision is that bribery requires that the official have a corrupt state\nof mind . . . Section 666 shares the defining characteristics of ยง201(b)โs bribery provision: the\ncorrupt state of mind and the intent to be influenced in the official act. The statutory text\ntherefore strongly suggests that ยง666โlike ยง201(b)โis a bribery statute, not a gratuities\nstatute.โ); id. at 18 (โThe bribery statute for federal officials, ยง201(b), uses the term โcorruptly.โ\nBut the gratuities statute for federal officials, ยง201(c), does not. The term โcorruptlyโ therefore\nsignals that ยง666 is a bribery statute.โ).\n21To the extent defendant raised additional issues in making her avoidance argument\nbefore the magistrate judge, I agree with the magistrate judgeโs analysis. (R. 43 at 32-34.)\n26\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 26 of 27     Document 48\n\nIII. CONCLUSION\nTHEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED that the magistrate judgeโs recommendation (R. 43) is\nadopted, and defendantโs motion to dismiss (R. 15) is denied.\nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this matter is scheduled for in-court hearing on\nWednesday, September 3, 2025, at 11:00 a.m. to address further scheduling. \n  Dated at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this 26th day of August, 2025.\n/s/ Lynn Adelman                                                    \nLYNN ADELMAN\nDistrict Judge\n27\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 08/26/25     Page 27 of 27     Document 48",

Background and Experience. \n1.  I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (โFBIโ) and have been \nso employed since 2014.  I am currently assigned to the Milwaukee Field Office.  As such, I am \nan investigative or law enforcement agent of the United States authorized under Title 18, United \nStates Code, Section 3052, that is, an officer of the United States who is empowered by law to \nconduct investigations, to make arrests, and to collect evidence for various violations of federal \nlaw.  I am also a Certified Public Accountant (โCPAโ) and worked as a CPA for seven years before \nmy employment with the FBI. \n2.  I am currently assigned to a White-Collar Crimes Squad, which investigates public \ncorruption crimes, civil rights crimes, and financial crimes. During my tenure with the FBI, I have \nparticipated in investigations involving the corruption of public officials, to include facilitation \npayments and kickbacks. I have participated in all aspects of investigations including, among other \nthings, executing arrest warrants.  \n3.  I base this affidavit upon personal knowledge and upon information reported to me \nby other federal law enforcement officers during and as part of their official duties, all of whom I \nbelieve to be truthful and reliable. In this affidavit, โcase agentsโ refers to me and other FBI Special \nAgents who directly have participated with me in this investigation. I also base this affidavit upon \ninformation provided by citizen witnesses and other information as described below. \nII.  Purpose of Affidavit. \n4.  I make this affidavit in support of a criminal complaint charging HANNAH C. \nDUGAN (b. 1959): with (1) obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 13     Document 1\n\nof the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505; and (2) concealing \nan individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, \nSection 1071. \n5.  This affidavit is intended to show merely that there is probable cause for the \nrequested criminal complaint and does not set forth my complete knowledge regarding this matter. \nIII.  Probable cause. \nA.  Background.  \n \n6.  I am aware from a review of public records that on March 18, 2025, Eduardo Flores-\nRuiz (โFlores-Ruizโ) (b. 1994) was charged in Milwaukee County Circuit Court Case Number \n2025CM000814 with three counts of Battery-Domestic Abuse-Infliction of Physical Pain or \nInjury.  \n7.  Agents  from  the  United  States  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (โDHSโ), \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations (โICE EROโ) \nidentified Flores-Ruiz as an individual who was not lawfully in the United States.  A review of \nFlores-Ruizโs Alien Registration File (โA-Fileโ) indicated that Flores-Ruiz is a native and citizen \nof Mexico and that Flores-Ruiz had been issued an I-860 Notice and Order of Expedited Removal \nby United States Border Patrol Agents on January 16, 2013, and that Flores-Ruiz was thereafter \nremoved to Mexico through the Nogales, Arizona, Port of Entry. There is no evidence in the A-\nFile or DHS indices indicating that Flores-Ruiz sought or obtained permission to return to the \nUnited States.  \n8.  The  Milwaukee  ICE  ERO  Office  determined  through  biometric  fingerprint \ncomparison that the fingerprints of the individual charged in Milwaukee County Case Number \n2025CM000814 match those in the A-File for the Eduardo Flores-Ruiz removed from the United \n  2\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 13     Document 1\n\nStates as described above.  On or about April 17, 2025, an authorized immigration official found \nprobable cause to believe Flores-Ruiz was removable from the United States and issued a warrant \nfor his arrest.  The warrant provided, โYOU ARE COMMANDED to arrest and take into custody \nfor removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the above-named alien \n[Flores-Ruiz identified on warrant].โ Upon his arrest, Flores-Ruiz would be given a Notice of \nIntent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order. He would then have an opportunity to contest the \ndetermination by making a written or oral statement to an immigration officer.   \n9.  The Milwaukee ICE ERO Office was aware that on April 18, 2025, Flores-Ruiz \nwas scheduled to attend a hearing in his criminal case. The hearing was set to take place in \nCourtroom 615, in front of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge HANNAH C. DUGAN. Based \non the above information, on April 18, 2025, members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force \ntraveled to the Milwaukee County Courthouse, with Flores-Ruizโs arrest warrant in hand, for the \npurpose of executing the warrant.  \n10.  I am aware that law enforcement routinely executes warrants and makes arrests in \nthe public areas of buildings such as the Milwaukee County Courthouse. The reasons for this \ninclude not only the fact that law enforcement knows the location at which the wanted individual \nshould be located but also the fact that the wanted individual would have entered through a security \ncheckpoint and thus unarmed, minimizing the risk of injury to law enforcement, the public, and \nthe wanted individual. As such, members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force developed a plan \nto arrest Flores-Ruiz in a public area outside of Courtroom 615 following his scheduled criminal \ncourt appearance before Judge DUGAN.    \n11.  I  am  aware  that  two  prior  arrests  in  public  areas  of  the  Milwaukee  County \nCourthouse Complex of individuals who were not lawfully present in the United States had \n  3\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 13     Document 1\n\nreceived public attention. Both incidents involved individuals who had been charged with criminal \noffenses but who were not in custody and appearing for scheduled hearings in their criminal cases. \nI also am aware that pursuant to its policies, which had been made known to courthouse officials, \nthe  Milwaukee  ICE  ERO  Task  Force  was  focusing  its  resources  on  apprehending  charged \ndefendants making appearances in criminal cases โ and not arresting victims, witnesses, or \nindividuals appearing for matters in family or civil court. \nB.  Arrival of arrest teams at the Milwaukee County Courthouse and \nnotification of intended arrest. \n \n12.  Six members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force planned to take part in the \narrest of Flores-Ruiz on April 18, 2025. This included ICE ERO Deportation Officer A, Customs \nand  Border  Protection  Officer  A,  FBI  Special  Agents  A  and  B,  and  Drug  Enforcement \nAdministration (โDEAโ) Special Agents A and B. The agents were generally dressed in plain \nclothes and intended to effectuate the arrest in as low-key and safe of a manner as possible.  \n13.  At approximately 8:00 am on April 18, 2025, Deportation Officer A and CBP \nOfficer A arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, presented identification to a security \nguard, and explained that they were present to make an arrest. Deportation Officer A and CBP \nOfficer A were asked to show not only their credentials but also their badges. The security guard \nstated that she needed to speak with a supervisor. A shift sergeant with Milwaukee County \nSheriffโs Office was contacted and spoke to Deportation Officer A. They discussed the details of \nthe planned arrest, including in which courtroom Flores-Ruiz was set to appear. The sergeant asked \nthat any arrest wait until after the completion of the scheduled hearing before Judge DUGAN. As \nthis was standard practice, Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A agreed, and they were \nallowed to proceed unescorted to the public hallway outside of Courtroom 615. \n  4\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 13     Document 1\n\n14.  The other members of the arrest team were already present in the sixth floor public \nhallway when Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A arrived. Before Deportation Officer A \nand CBP Officer A arrived outside of Courtroom 615, FBI agents A and B had advised the \ncourtroom deputy for Courtroom 615 that law enforcement was there to arrest Flores-Ruiz. FBI \nAgent A displayed his credentials to the courtroom deputy and informed him that they were there \nto assist ICE in arresting Flores-Ruiz. They agreed that the arrest would take place after Flores-\nRuizโs court appearance. The agents then left the courtroom and took positions at different \nlocations in the public hallway.  \n15.  Case agents have interviewed the courtroom deputy present in Courtroom 615 on \nApril 18, 2025, who corroborated the above information. The courtroom deputy had opened the \ndoors to the courtroom at approximately 8:15 am and reported that individuals began checking in \nfor the list of matters scheduled for that morning. The courtroom deputy had received a list of \nindividuals appearing that day, and the courtroom deputy checked in defendants while attorneys \nchecked in with the clerk.  \n16.  The courtroom deputy explained that at approximately 8:15 am, FBI agents advised \nthat they were working with ICE and were planning to arrest Flores-Ruiz. The courtroom deputy \nasked that the agents wait outside and arrest Flores-Ruiz after the hearing. The agents agreed and \nleft the courtroom.  \n17.  The courtroom deputy told case agents that after an ICE arrest in the courthouse \nearlier that month, a shift sergeant had asked bailiffs to alert a supervisor at the Milwaukee County \nSheriffโs Office if ICE agents were in the building. Accordingly, the courtroom deputy notified a \nshift sergeant.   \n  5\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 13     Document 1\n\n18.  Arrest team members reported that while waiting outside of the courtroom, a \nwoman  approached  and  took  photos  of  arrest  team  members.  DEA  Agent  B,  who  was \ninconspicuously seated away from the group, was not photographed. The individual taking \nphotographs of the agents has been identified by multiple witnesses as an attorney employed by \nthe State of Wisconsin Public Defenders Office (โAttorney Aโ). \n19.  Team members observed Flores-Ruiz arrive on the 6th floor of the courthouse at \napproximately 8:43 a.m. He was greeted by his attorney, and the two entered Courtroom 615 \ntogether. \nC.  Judge DUGAN learns of ICEโs presence and confronts members of the arrest \nteam. \n \n20.  Witnesses  have  described  Judge  DUGANโs  response  to  learning  of  ICEโs \npresence. For example, the courtroom deputy indicated that when Flores-Ruiz arrived, Judge \nDUGAN already was on the bench and conducting proceedings (unrelated to the Flores-Ruiz \nmatter). The courtroom deputy observed Attorney A (the individual who had photographed the \nagents) enter and approach Judge DUGANโs clerk. Attorney A stated that there appeared to be \nICE agents in the hallway. Attorney A told the clerk where the agents were seated and what they \nwere wearing.  \n21.  The courtroom deputy reported that the clerk then got up and talked with Judge \nDUGAN. Judge DUGAN became visibly angry, commented that the situation was โabsurd,โ left \nthe bench, and entered chambers. At the time, Flores-Ruiz was seated in the gallery of the \ncourtroom.  \n22.  Another individual, Attorney B, was working as an Assistant District Attorney in \nJudge  DUGANโs  courtroom  on  April  18,  2025.  According  to  Attorney  B,  there  were \n  6\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 13     Document 1\n\napproximately eight criminal cases, including Flores-Ruizโs case, scheduled for pretrial hearings \nthat morning. Attorney B was aware that the victims from Flores-Ruizโs criminal case were in \ncourt. While Attorney B was busy preparing for that morningโs docket, Attorney B heard someone \nannounce, โICE is here.โ Shortly thereafter, Attorney B heard Judge DUGAN say that she was \ngoing to call the Chief Judge before leaving the courtroom.   \n23.  Members of the arrest team reported the following events after Judge DUGAN \nlearned of their presence and left the bench. Judge DUGAN and Judge A, who were both wearing \njudicial robes, approached members of the arrest team in the public hallway. Judge Aโs courtroom \nis located adjacent to Judge DUGANโs courtroom. Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge \nDUGAN was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor. Judge DUGAN addressed \nDeportation Officer A and asked if Deportation Officer A was present for a court appearance. \nWhen Deportation Officer A responded, โno,โ Judge DUGAN stated that Deportation Officer A \nwould need to leave the courthouse. Deportation Officer A stated that Deportation Officer A was \nthere to effectuate an arrest.  Judge DUGAN asked if Deportation Officer A had a judicial warrant, \nand Deportation Officer A responded, โNo, I have an administrative warrant.โ Judge DUGAN \nstated that Deportation Officer A needed a judicial warrant. Deportation Officer A told Judge \nDUGAN that Deportation Officer A was in a public space and had a valid immigration warrant. \nJudge DUGAN asked to see the administrative warrant and Deportation Officer A offered to show \nit to her.  Judge DUGAN then demanded that Deportation Officer A speak with the Chief Judge. \nJudge DUGAN then had a similar interaction with FBI Agent B and CBP Officer A.  After finding \nout that they were not present for a court appearance and that they were with ICE, Judge DUGAN \nordered them to report to the Chief Judgeโs office. \n  7\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 8 of 13     Document 1\n\n24.  Judge A then escorted members of the arrest team away from Courtroom 615, down \nthe hall, and through a set of double doors towards the reception area for the Chief Judgeโs office. \nDEA Agent B, who was not recognized by Judge DUGAN and Judge A as being part of the arrest \nteam, remained behind outside of Courtroom 615.  \n25.  The courtroom deputy reported observing a portion of the above-described events \nin the hallway. According to the courtroom deputy, shortly after Judge DUGAN was advised of \nICEโs presence, the courtroom deputy left the courtroom to look for an unrelated defendant (whom \nthe courtroom deputy was seeking to arrest for an open warrant). The courtroom deputy saw Judge \nDUGAN in her robe in the public hallway telling one of the federal agents that he needed to go \ntalk to the Chief Judge. Judge DUGAN appeared visibly angry and was walking quickly. As soon \nas the agent entered the Chief Judgeโs vestibule area, the courtroom deputy saw Judge DUGAN \nwalk south down the hallway and enter a locked door near Courtroom 615. I am familiar with the \nfloor plan for the sixth floor of the courthouse and believe the door Judge DUGAN entered led to \na non-public hallway from which she could access her courtroom and chambers. \n26.  DEA Agent B, who had remained in the hallway and had not been recognized as a \nmember of the arrest team, reported that Judge DUGAN walked around the hallway and appeared \nto be looking for additional agents before she returned to her courtroom.  \n27.  Once inside the office of the Chief Judge, Deportation Officer A showed Judge A \nhis credentials and the administrative warrant. Judge A asked the Chief Judgeโs clerk to make a \ncopy of the warrant and asked whether the Chief Judge was available. The clerk advised that the \nChief Judge was not in the building but later advised that he was on the phone. At that point, Judge \nA left, and Deportation Officer A went inside a more private area of the Chief Judgeโs office to \nspeak with him on the phone. During their conversation, the Chief Judge stated he was working \n  8\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 13     Document 1\n\non a policy which would dictate locations within the courthouse where ICE could safely conduct \nenforcement actions. The Chief Judge emphasized that such actions should not take place in \ncourtrooms or other private locations within the building. Deportation Officer A asked about \nwhether enforcement actions could take place in the hallway. The Chief Judge indicated that \nhallways are public areas. When the Chief Judge expressed interest in talking to ICE ERO \nmanagement about this policy, Deportation Officer A provided him with contact information for \nICE EROโs Assistant Field Office Director. \n28.  While Deportation Officer A was speaking with the Chief Judge, DEA Agent A, \nCBP Officer A, and FBI Agents A and B waited in the vestibule area outside the Chief Judgeโs \nOffice. DEA Agent A departed the area after a short while.  Judge DUGANโs courtroom deputy \nthen approached the remaining arrest team members and stated that the courtroom deputy was not \nthe one who had notified Judge DUGAN about their arrest plans. The courtroom deputy also made \na comment about Judge DUGAN โpushingโ Flores-Ruizโs case through, which the arrest team \ninterpreted to mean that Judge DUGAN was attempting to expedite Flores-Ruizโs hearing.   \nD.   Judge DUGAN escorts Flores-Ruiz through a โjury doorโ to avoid his arrest.  \n \n29.  Multiple witnesses have described their observations after Judge DUGAN returned \nto her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the Chief Judgeโs office. For \nexample, the courtroom deputy recalled that upon the courtroom deputyโs return to the courtroom, \ndefense counsel for Flores-Ruiz was talking to the clerk, and Flores-Ruiz was seated in the jury \nbox, rather than in the gallery. The courtroom deputy believed that counsel and the clerk were \nhaving an off-the-record conversation to pick the next court date. Defense counsel and Flores-Ruiz \nthen walked toward each other and toward the public courtroom exit. The courtroom deputy then \nsaw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like โWait, come with me.โ \n  9\n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 13     Document 1\n\nDespite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge \nDUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the โjury door,โ \nwhich leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse. These events were also unusual for two reasons. \nFirst, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge DUGAN direct people not to sit in the jury \nbox because it was exclusively for the juryโs use.  Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only \ndeputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back \njury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.   \n30.  Attorney  B  similarly  explained  that  after  returning  to  the  courtroom,  Judge \nDUGAN forcefully motioned for Flores-Ruizโs attorney and a male she did not know (Attorney B \nhad never met Flores-Ruiz) to approach. Flores-Ruizโs attorney appeared to be confused by the \njudgeโs gesture but complied with her directive.  Judge DUGAN commanded Flores-Ruizโs \nattorney and the male to leave through a backdoor of the courtroom. Attorney B then saw Judge \nDUGAN  escort  Flores-Ruizโs  attorney  and  the  male  through  a  non-public  door  near  the \ncourtroomโs jury box. Shortly thereafter, Judge DUGAN  came back to the courtroom and \nconducted hearings on that morningโs docket. Later that morning, Attorney B realized that Flores-\nRuizโs case had never been called and asked the court about it. Attorney B learned that Flores-\nRuizโs case had been adjourned. This happened without Attorney Bโs knowledge or participation, \neven though Attorney B was present in court to handle Flores-Ruizโs case on behalf of the state, \nand even though victims were present in the courtroom. \n31.  A Victim Witness Specialist (VWS) employed by the Milwaukee County District \nAttorneyโs Office was present in Courtroom 615 on April 18, 2025. The VWS made contact with \nthe victims in Flores-Ruizโs criminal case, who were also in court. The VWS was able to identify \nFlores-Ruiz based upon the victimsโ reactions to his presence in court. The VWS observed Judge \n  10 \n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 11 of 13     Document 1\n\nDUGAN gesture towards Flores-Ruiz and an unknown Hispanic woman.  The VWS stated she \nbelieved the Hispanic woman may have been an interpreter.  However, based on the VWSโs \ndescription of the woman and other witness statements, I believe the Hispanic woman to which \nthe VWS referred was Flores-Ruizโs attorney.  The VWS stated that Judge DUGAN then exited \nthrough the jury door with Flores-Ruiz and the Hispanic woman. The VWS was concerned because \nFlores-Ruizโs case had not yet been called, and the victims were waiting.   \n32.  Another attorney (โAttorney Cโ), who was in Courtroom 615 on April 18, 2025, to \nrepresent a client, also advised case agents that he observed Judge DUGAN forcefully direct two \nindividuals, a man and a woman, to leave through the jury door. Attorney C indicated that this was \ndone with a โsternโ tone.  \nE.  Ruiz makes it out of the courthouse and is arrested after a foot chase. \n \n33.  After leaving the Chief Judgeโs vestibule and returning to the public hallway, DEA \nAgent A reported that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney were in the public hallway. DEA Agent B also \nobserved Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the hallway near Courtroom 615 and noted that Flores-\nRuiz was looking around the hallway. From different vantage points, both agents observed Flores-\nRuiz and his counsel walk briskly towards the elevator bank on the south end of the sixth floor.  I \nam familiar with the layout of the sixth floor of the courthouse and know that the south elevators \nare not the closest elevators to Courtroom 615, and therefore it appears that Flores-Ruiz and his \ncounsel elected not to use the closest elevator bank to Courtroom 615.  DEA Agent A followed \nFlores-Ruiz and his attorney towards the south elevator bank. At approximately 8:50 a.m., DEA \nAgent A alerted other members of the arrest team that DEA Agent A was on the elevator with \nFlores-Ruiz. While on the elevator, Flores-Ruiz and his attorney spoke to each other in Spanish, \n  11 \n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 12 of 13     Document 1\n\nwhich DEA Agent A did not understand. They exited the elevator on one of the bottom floors of \nthe courthouse and used the Ninth Street public entrance/exit to leave the building.  \n34.  Having received the above-referenced information from DEA Agent A, other \nmembers of the arrest team scrambled to locate Flores-Ruiz and arrest him. DEA Agent B and FBI \nAgents A and B took another elevator down to one of the bottom floors of the courthouse and \nquickly exited the building onto 9th Street. After DEA Agent A notified the team that Flores-Ruiz \nwas in the front of the courthouse near the flagpole, the agents ran towards the front of the \ncourthouse. FBI Agent B and DEA Agent A approached Flores-Ruiz and identified themselves as \nlaw enforcement. Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued. \nThe agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended \nhim near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and \ndetained. Around 9:05 a.m., or approximately 22 minutes after the arrest team first spotted Flores-\nRuiz on the sixth floor of the courthouse, FBI Agent A communicated to the surveillance team that \nFlores-Ruiz had been arrested. Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A were notified that Flores-\nRuiz was in custody while they were still inside the courthouse speaking with the Chief Judge on \nthe phone. \nIV.  Conclusion. \n35.  Based on the above information, I have probable cause to believe that Judge \nDUGAN violated Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505, and Title 18, United States Code, \nSection 1071. \n  12 \n \nCase 2:25-mj-00397-SCD     Filed 04/24/25     Page 13 of 13     Document 1",

DUGAN,               Case No. 25-CR-00089 \n                 \nDefendant.   \n \n \nDEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS \n \n \nHon. Hannah C. Dugan moves for an order dismissing the indictment. This is no \nordinary criminal case, and Dugan is no ordinary criminal defendant. \nDugan is a Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge. She was arrested and indicted \nfor actions allegedly taken in and in the immediate vicinity of her courtroom, involving a \nperson appearing before her as a party. The governmentโs prosecution of Judge Dugan is \nvirtually unprecedented and entirely unconstitutionalโit violates the Tenth Amendment \nand fundamental principles of federalism and comity reflected in that amendment and in \nthe very structure of the United States Constitution. \nThe  problems  with  this  prosecution  are  legion,  but  most  immediately,  the \ngovernment cannot prosecute Judge Dugan because she is entitled to judicial immunity for \nher official acts. Immunity is not a defense to the prosecution to be determined later by a \njury or court; it is an absolute bar to the prosecution at the outset. See Trump v. United States, \n603 U.S. 593, 630 (2024). \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 05/14/25     Page 1 of 7     Document 15\n\nJudge Dugan reserves her right to seek other relief, including by other motions before \nand at trial. But the immunity and federalism issues must be resolved swiftly because the \ngovernment has no basis in law to prosecute her. The prosecution against her is barred. The \nCourt should dismiss the indictment. Rule 12(b), FED. R. CRIM. P., allows the Court to grant \nthe relief Judge Dugan seeks. \nIn support of this motion, Judge Dugan shows: \n1.  The indictment charges Judge Dugan with concealing a person from arrest and \nobstruction for actions she took in and near her courtroom. The alleged conduct ranges \nfrom directing peopleโs movement in and around the courtroom to advising a party that \nhe could appear remotely for his next hearing. ECF 6 at 1โ2. \n2.  The complaint alleges a more cohesive story. In pertinent part, it alleges the \nfollowing.  On  Good  Friday,  April  18,  2025,  Judge  Dugan  was  presiding  over  her \nmisdemeanor docket in the Milwaukee County Courthouse. ECF 1, ยถ15. Among the \nmany defendants with hearings that day was Eduardo Flores-Ruiz. Id., ยถ22. Federal \nagents arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse to execute an administrative arrest \nwarrant for Flores-Ruiz. Id., ยถ8. A deputy in Judge Duganโs courtroom claimed that Judge \nDugan directed Flores-Ruiz to leave her courtroom through a jury door. Id., ยถ29. Flores-\nRuiz emerged from a doorway into the same public hallway a few feet from Judge \nDuganโs courtroom doors. Id., ยถ33. Federal law enforcement saw him, followed him to \nthe elevator, continued to follow Flores-Ruiz out of the courthouse, and then arrested him \nafter a foot chase. Id., ยถยถ33โ34. \n  2 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 05/14/25     Page 2 of 7     Document 15\n\n3.  Even if (contrary to what the trial evidence would show) Judge Dugan took the \nactions the complaint alleges, these plainly were judicial acts for which she has absolute \nimmunity from criminal prosecution. Judges are empowered to maintain control over \ntheir courtrooms specifically and the courthouse generally. Stevens v. Osuna, 877 F.3d \n1293, 1305 (11th Cir. 2017). โ[T]he issuance of an order removing persons from the \ncourthouse in the interest of maintaining such control is an ordinary function performed \nby judges[.]โ Id. \n4.  Judge Duganโs subjective motivations are irrelevant to immunity. โJudges are \nentitled to absolute immunity for their judicial acts, without regard to the motive with \nwhich those acts are allegedly performed.โ Id.; accord Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. at \n618  (โIn  dividing  official  from  unofficial  conduct,  courts  may  not  inquire  into  the \nPresident's motivesโ). \n5.  Since at least the early 17th century in England, and carried on through common \nlaw in the United States, judges of record have been entitled to absolute immunity for \nofficial acts with a few exceptions not applicable here. Floyd & Barker, 12 Co. Rep. 23, 25, \n77 Eng. Rep. 1305, 1307 (Star Chamber 1607); see Bradley v. Fisher, 80 U.S. 335, 347โ48 \n(1871), citing Floyd, 12 Co. Rep. at 25; see Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 553โ54 (1967), citing \nBradley, 80 U.S. at 349โ50. \n6.  Judge Dugan therefore has both immunity from conviction and immunity from \nprosecution. โThe essence of immunity โis its possessorโs entitlement not to have to \nanswer for [her] conductโ in court.โ Trump, 603 U.S. at 630, quoting Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 \nU.S. 511, 525 (1985); Mitchell, 472 U.S. at 526 (โThe entitlement is an immunity from \n  3 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 05/14/25     Page 3 of 7     Document 15\n\nsuit rather than a mere defense to liability; and like an absolute immunity, it is effectively \nlost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.โ) (emphasis in original).  \n7.  Congress did not abrogate this common law immunity in 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1071 and \n1505 as it did in 18 U.S.C. ยง 242. Compare Pierson, 386 U.S. at 554 (42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 did not \nabrogate civil judicial immunity) to Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 429 (1976) (18 U.S.C. \nยง 242 allows the criminal prosecution of judges for civil rights violations). Congress \nenacted 18 U.S.C ยง 242 under Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment with an express \nfocus on the unconstitutional behavior of state actors, including judges. But 18 U.S.C. ยงยง \n1071 and 1505 are generic criminal statutes enacted pursuant to Congressโ Article I \npowers and reflecting no congressional intent to abrogate a bedrock immunity available \nto state judicial officials.   \n8.  It is doubtful that Congressโ Article I powers would extend to criminalizing the \nactions of state court judges in their courtrooms. Criminalizing the official acts of a state \ncourt judge controlling her courtroom would implicate all the concerns that motivated \nthe Tenth Amendment. And nothing in this indictment alleges any violation of a personโs \nconstitutional rights in ways that implicate the unique concerns of the Reconstruction \nAmendments. But the Court need not decide whether Congress could have abrogated \njudicial immunity in 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 1071 and 1505 because Congress did not do so. Neither \nshould be construed to criminalize an official act of a state court judge, and the indictment \ndoes not allege that they do. \n9.  The problems with this indictment run deeper. Immunities aside, the indictment \nruns afoul of the Tenth Amendment and constitutional principles of federalism. Federal \n  4 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 05/14/25     Page 4 of 7     Document 15\n\npower is limited to specific, enumerated areas in the Constitution. All other powers โare \nreserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.โ U.S. CONST. AMEND. X. That \nincludes the general police power: the states retain it; the federal government does not \nhave it. Unsurprisingly, then, the American judicial system empirically is almost entirely \nthe realm of the states. Federal civil jurisdiction is limited. U.S. CONST. ART. III. Federal \ncriminal jurisdiction is limited. See e.g., United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549, 561, 561 n.3 \n(1995). Thatโs why over 99.4% of criminal cases filed in this country are in state courts.* \n10. The  governmentโs  prosecution  here  reaches  directly  into  a  state  courthouse, \ndisrupting active proceedings, and interferes with the official duties of an elected judge. \nโA State defines itself as a sovereign through โthe structure of its government, and the \ncharacter of those who exercise government authority.โโ McDonnell v. United States, 579 \nU.S. 550, 576 (2016), quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460 (1991). Judge Dugan \nwas  elected  by  the  people  of  Milwaukee  County  to  adjudicate  their  disputes  and \nadminister the laws of Wisconsin. WIS. CONST. ART. VII, ยงยง 2, 7. The federal government \nviolated  Wisconsinโs  sovereignty  on  April  18  when  it  disrupted  Judge  Duganโs \ncourtroom, and it is violating Wisconsinโs sovereignty now with this prosecution. The \nCourt should end the violation of Wisconsinโs sovereignty and dismiss the indictment. \n11. As a practical matter, counsel for Judge Dugan stand ready to file briefs and to \nparticipate in an evidentiary hearing if either or both will aid the Court, but they stand \non the observation that any further proceedings in this case, other than immediate \ndismissal, are barred by official acts immunity and judicial immunity. Regardless, in the \n \n* Statistics available at: \nhttps://www.courtstatistics.org/court-statistics/state-versus-federal-caseloads  \n  5 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 05/14/25     Page 5 of 7     Document 15\n\nevent this prosecution moves forward, Judge Dugan reserves her right to supplement this \nmotion with briefing and other filings submitted within 20 days of arraignment, as \nprovided in Criminal Local Rule 12(b)(1). \nDated at Madison, Wisconsin May 14, 2025. \n            Respectfully submitted, \n            HON.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,                \n     \nPlaintiff, \n                  \n                 \nv.                Case No. 25-CR-0089-LA \n \n \nHANNAH C. DUGAN, \n                 \nDefendant. \n \n \n \nDEFENDANTโS OBJECTIONS \nTO MAGISTRATE JUDGEโS RECOMMENDATION ON \nMOTION TO DISMISS \n \n \n \nI. \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \n \n  Today the Court confronts a case in which a state judge faces federal prosecution for \nofficial acts in the course of her ordinary judicial duties, and nothing more. The magistrate \njudge agrees that every act this indictment names is โpart of a judgeโs job.โ Report & \nRecommendation at 30 (July 7, 2025) (Dkt. 43). The indictment alleges no graft, no quid pro \nquo, no unofficial acts at all. It does not allege violation of any personโs civil rights that the \nThirteenth,  Fourteenth,  or  Fifteenth  Amendments  protect.  This  is  a  federal  criminal \nprosecution of a state judge for doing her job; not in the way that some federal agents \npreferred, true, but her job all the same. Yet the magistrate judge would allow it to proceed. \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 1 of 30     Document 45\n\n  Why?  Under the magistrate judgeโs proposed rule, every official act of state judges \npotentially is fair game for federal prosecution: \nAgain, the distinction that takes these official duty cases out of the shield of \nimmunity is not self-enrichment or the motive of the judge. It is whether the \ncriminal law has been violated. In other words, a judgeโs actions, even when \ndone in her official capacity, do[ ] not bar criminal prosecution if the actions \nwere done in violation of the criminal law. \n \nReport & Recommendation at 28 (July 7, 2025) (Dkt. 43); see also id. at 23, 29 (to same effect). \n \n  That recommendation offers no limiting principle and clashes with first principles \nand decisions as recent as Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024). It posits a rule that \nwould have been anathema to the Framers. They yielded sovereignty only to a federal \ngovernment with strictly limited powers. The idea that the federal government someday \ncould arrest and prosecute state judges for official acts in derogation of long-settled English \nimmunity would have been wrong to them. \n  It still is. If this Court adopted the recommendation, state and federal judges would \nbe vulnerable to prosecution by the federal executive any time they handle a trial involving \ncontraband in evidence or schedule a hearing in ways that inconvenienceโand thus \narguably impedeโfederal officers. A judge handling a child pornography case or a drug \ncase, with either child pornography images or controlled substances passed around as \nevidence in court (that is, possessed and distributed), would be at the mercy of federal law \nenforcement. So would any state or federal judge scheduling a hearing or holding over an \nundocumented accused, victim, or material witness in ways that irritate or slow federal \nofficers hoping to arrest or remove the undocumented person with a crucial role in the case.1   \n \n1 Some of these examples seem farfetched. So did this prosecution until it happened. \n  2 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 2 of 30     Document 45\n\n  But the magistrate judge errs. In fact from the start, American law has prevented \nsuch prosecutions on principled grounds. Immunity is not restricted to the civil sphere; it \nprotects against criminal liability for most official acts. Indeed, it began in the criminal \nsphere and extended to the civil from there.  \n  For purposes here, the central lessons of Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024), \nare that as to federal criminal prosecutions, official acts are immune, it is not sufficient to \nrely on the discretion of federal prosecutors, and immunity must be resolved before trial. \nNote at the outset that the Report & Recommendation echoes the mistake that the district \ncourt made in Trump. That district court acknowledged civil immunity from damages for \npresidents. But it denied the motion to dismiss, writing, โโformer Presidents do not possess \nabsolute federal criminal immunity for any acts committed while in office.โโ Trump, 603 U.S. \nat 604 (quoting district court opinion). \n  That is not just a superficial parallel to this case. The linkage between judicial \nimmunity and the presidential immunity that Trump settled is deeper than that. As Judge \nDugan traced in her earlier briefs, Trump rests in significant part on judicial immunity cases \nfor official acts. Presidents and former presidents now have what judges had first. \n  Now, it is not as clear that judicial immunity is or must be coextensive with the \npossible limits of presidential immunity, which Trump left fuzzy at the edges. Judicial \nimmunity does not and need not extend beyond official acts. Unofficial acts, including those \ninvolving graft or coercive sexual gratification for which collateral judicial acts are the \ninducement  or  the  threat,  get  no  criminal  judicial  immunity.  Official  acts  that  deny \nindividual constitutional rights under the Reconstruction Amendments do not, either. \n  3 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 3 of 30     Document 45\n\n  Other  official  actsโthat  is,  not  involving  graft  or  sexual  gratification,  and  not \ndenying constitutional rightsโclearly do enjoy judicial immunity from prosecution. As to \nordinary criminal laws, the Foundersโ vision remains intact: federal prosecutors cannot \ntarget a judgeโs official actions in and around the courtroom. That immunity leaves plenty \nof scope for prosecuting corrupt judges.  \nThe  Court  can  avoid  definitively  resolving  these  constitutional  questions  by \nrecognizing that the statutes at issue here do not reach the conduct alleged. There are \ncountless ways to obstruct justice or harbor a fugitive that do not involve the exercise of \nstate judicial power. There is no reason to think that the Congress that enacted these statutes \nthought it was empowering federal agents to arrest and prosecute state judges for official \nacts. And there is no reason to extend these statutes to circumstances that threaten to upend \nthe federal-state balance and chill state judges in the discharge of their official duties. \nWhether by recognizing the breadth of immunity or the limits of the statutes at issue, this \nCourt should dismiss the indictment. \n \nII. \n \nOBJECTIONS \n \n \n  Again, the magistrate judge agrees that each of the five specific acts this indictment \nalleges (in Count 2, because Count 1 claims only that Judge Dugan โconcealedโ E.F.R.) โall \nare part of a judgeโs job.โ Report & Recommendation at 30. They were, in other words, \nofficial acts and the magistrate judge does not contend otherwise.  \n  4 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 4 of 30     Document 45\n\n  Picking up there, Judge Dugan relies on her previous motion and two briefs. She also \nagrees with the amicus brief of 138 former state and federal judges (Dkt. 22-1). \nA. Judicial Immunity from Criminal Prosecution for Official Acts. \n \n  State  supreme  courts  and  our  highest  federal  court  repeatedly  and \nconsistently have recognized judicial immunity from prosecution for more than 200 years, \neven  if  the  magistrate  judge  remains  unconvinced  that  the  Supreme  Court  ever  has \nrecognized criminal judicial immunity in any setting. The recognition of immunity from \nprosecution for official judicial acts has flowed from Lord Cokeโs foundational decision in \nFloyd v. Barker, 12 Co. Rep. 23, 24-25, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305, 1307 (Star Chamber 1607).2 See \nDefendantโs Memorandum at 5-11 (Dkt. 21). The Report & Recommendation does accept \nthat this first clear statement of judicial immunity doctrine applied to criminal prosecutions \nfor official acts. That was the explicit issue in Floyd. See Report & Recommendation at 4-5. \n    Lord Cokeโs decision in Floyd articulated the rule that came to America and \nthat  the  Framersโand  early  American  courts  and  prosecutors  steeped  in  English \ncommon lawโsurely understood. From the first years of the nineteenth-century, state \ncases explicitly recognized criminal immunity for judges. See Yates v. Lansing, 5 Johns. \n282, 290โ94, 1810 WL 1044 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1810) (Chancellor Kent relying on Floyd), aff'd, \n1811 WL 1445 (N.Y. 1811);3 and Hamilton v. Williams, 26 Ala. 527, 533, 1855 WL 345 (Ala. \n \n2  Precursors to judicial immunity may date back to the mid-fourteenth century. See Jay Feinman & Roy S. \nCohen, Suing Judges: History and Theory, 31 S.C. L. REV. 201, 206 (1980). \n \n3 Although some have forgotten him, Chancellor James Kent was for ten years the highest-ranking judge in \nNew York, the first professor of law at Columbia University, and the author of Kentโs COMMENTARIES ON \nAMERICAN LAW. That was in its sixth edition when he died in 1847. The Supreme Court cited Kentโs \nCOMMENTARIES as recently as last year. Sheetz v. County of El Dorado, California, 601 U.S. 267, 277โ78 (2024). See \nalso history.nycourts.gov/figure/james-kent/; www.britannica.com/biography/James-Kent. The magistrate \njudge devalues the importance Yates in shaping American law. Chancellor Kent and Justice Joseph Story (1779โ\n  5 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 5 of 30     Document 45\n\n1855). An 1871 U.S. Supreme Court decision then relied expressly on Floyd and Yates in \nextending the established criminal immunity of judges to civil cases. Bradley v. Fisher, 80 \nU.S. (13 Wall.) 335, 347 nn.12 & 13, 347โ48 (1871). A quarter century later, the Supreme \nCourt recognized in Spalding v. Vilas, 161 U.S. 483, 494 (1896), that judicial criminal \nimmunity is part of the nationโs law: โThe doctrine which holds a judge exempt from a \ncivil suit or indictment for any act done or omitted to be done by him, sitting as judge, has \na deep root in the common law.โ Spalding, 161 U.S. at 494, quoting Yates (italics added). \n    Twentieth-century cases again explicitly acknowledged judicial immunity \nfrom criminal prosecution for official acts not involving constitutional rights under the \nReconstruction Amendments. See Commonwealth v. Tartar, 239 S.W.2d 265, 266 (Ct. App. \nKy. 1951) (sustaining demurrer to indictment of judge for acts in official capacity), \nquoting 48 C.J.S., Judges, ยง 71; and United States v. Chaplin, 54 F. Supp. 926 (S.D. Cal. 1944). \nEven a twenty-first-century decision acknowledges judicial immunity for official acts not \nviolating individual constitutional rights. Rockett v. Eighmy, 71 F.4th 665, 668โ69 (8th Cir. \n2023) (civil case recognizing that, โJudicial immunity continues to apply today, not only \nin prosecutions like Floyd, but in civil-rights actions brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983โ). \n    Importantly,  Pulliam  v.  Allen,  466  U.S.  522  (1984),  continues  to  shape \nimmunity analysis around the common law. First, courts should refer to the common \nlaw. And second, they should assess whether Congress has abrogated a common law \n \n1845; author of COMMENTARIES ON THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES (1833)) were the only two \npreeminent antebellum American judges who also have been remembered as important commentators on \nUnited States law. For that matter, Lord Cokeโs importance needs no further comment. \n  6 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 6 of 30     Document 45\n\nimmunity. Pulliam, 466 U.S. at 529. Pulliam itself relied extensively on Floyd, see id. at 530โ\n32, making clear that Floyd anchors common law on this topic and remains vital.  \n    In deciding whether Congress abrogated the immunity of state actorsโor \nwhenever the federal-state balance is alteredโcourts must demand clear statements from \nCongress and recognize that โthe Fourteenth Amendment does not override all principles \nof federalism.โ Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 469 (1991) (rejecting extension of ADEA \nto high state officials, even though that act generally was within Congressโs power under \nthe Commerce Clause); see also City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 519 (1997) (Section 5 \nof the Fourteenth Amendment is a positive grant of power, but Congressโs realm under \nthat enforcement clause โextends only to โenforc[ing]โ the provisions of the Fourteenth \nAmendment;โ citing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 326 (1966)).  \n    So it is not clear that Congress has the power to abrogate the immunity of \nstate officials at all except when exercising its distinct powers under the Reconstruction \nAmendments. At a bare minimum, Congress would need to indicate an intent to abrogate \nwith clarity. Congress did not here.4 \n \n4  Judge Dugan knows of no evidence that Congress ever has sought to abrogate judicial immunity from \nprosecution for official acts of state officers, even assuming that Congress could. If Congress already had the \npower to punish the acts of state officers, including judges, for official acts under color of state law, the three \nenforcement clauses in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments would be sheer surplusage. \nConstitutional text cannot be read that way. Here, a court would have to read not just one constitutional clause \nas surplusage, but three: the separate enforcement clauses in all three Reconstruction Amendments. \n \n    In fact, as Gregory v. Ashcroft, City of Boerne, and Katzenbach all suggest implicitly, before the Reconstruction \nAmendments the Tenth Amendment foreclosed congressional power to enact federal crimes punishing state \nofficers for official acts. See also Ex Parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 346 (1880) (โNor does it make any difference that \nsuch legislation [the 1876 Act criminally punishing the exclusion of otherwise qualified Black jurors] is \nrestrictive of what the State might have done before the constitutional amendment was adopted. The \nprohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment are directed to the States, and they are, to a degree, restrictions of \nState power. It is these which Congress is empowered to enforce, and to enforce against State action, however \nput forth, whether that action be executive, legislative, or judicialโ). Judge Dugan returns to the Tenth \nAmendment in part II.B below. \n  7 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 7 of 30     Document 45\n\n1.  Lack of Opportunity for Application does not Undermine Acceptance. \n \n  The problem, then, is not that Judge Dugan can point to only four centuries \nof decisions expressly recognizing judicial immunity from criminal prosecution for official \nacts. The problem is that the magistrate judge and the government cannot point to a single \ndecision denying judicial immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, outside the \nconceded exception for statutes enacted pursuant to the Reconstruction Amendments. \n  The fact that the Supreme Court necessarily has referred to that criminal \nimmunity in dicta, because the cases before it unsurprisingly were civil, does not erode the \nrecognition of criminal immunity. Consider the obvious. In civil cases, there would be no \nreason to mention criminal immunity at all if it was not extant and alive. Continued \nrecognition of judicial immunity from indictment for official acts acknowledges the origins \nand ongoing vitality of that application of judicial immunity. It does not proclaim absence \nor suggest that we await emergence of criminal immunity. \n  No, the opposite. Criminal immunity has been around longer than civil. \nPutting aside fair questions about the exact scope of that civil immunity, the temptation to \nextend criminal immunity to civil immunity for judgesโ official acts was understandable \nbecause attempted civil litigation against judges has proliferated since the nineteenth \ncentury. Yet the reasons for judicial immunity are stronger, if anything, in its original \ncriminal application: the risk that a judge will be arrested, shackled, and jailed for carrying \nout the duties of his or her office, and the in terrorem effect that necessarily would have on \nthat judge and others, is a much greater threat to the judicial task and role than civil cases.  \n  8 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 8 of 30     Document 45\n\n  Floyd identified several reasons supporting judicial immunity. Floyd, 12 Co. \nRep. at 24-25. In modern parlance, those were finality; maintaining the dignity of, and \nrespect for, courts; and preventing harassment of judges by litigation. Nancy Amoury \nCombs, Redressing Judicial Misbehavior: An Integrated Approach to Judicial Immunity, 58 U.C. \nDAVIS L. REV. 1165, 1188 (2024), citing Floyd, 77 Eng. Rep. at 1307. Another rationale emerged \nlater: judicial independence. Combs, Redressing Judicial Misbehavior, 58 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. at \n1190-92; see also Yates, 5 Johns. at 291. That one has become preeminent. Criminal immunity \nfits better with that top concern than civil immunity, too, given the loss of liberty and \nreputation that criminal prosecutions alone threaten. \n    Like the England of Lord Coke, the modern United States has rival courts, an \nunavoidable aspect of federalism. Criminal immunity not only prevents a judge from being \nwalked  handcuffed  into  a  rival  court;  unlike  civil  immunity,  it  also  protects  judicial \nindependence from the executive branch. A disappointed litigant can file a lawsuit, but the \nexecutive branch can search, arrest, and jail. Those powers endanger judicial independence \nmuch more than a civil litigant ever could. \n  Beyond that, in civil cases, judges and other state actors are unlikely to carry \ntheir own defense costs: practically, either state Attorney Generalโs offices or local city \nattorneys or county corporation counsel usually defend. When there are civil judgments \nagainst police officers and other law enforcement actors who have only qualified immunity, \nthese actors are entirely or mostly indemnified more than 99% of the time. See Joanna C. \nSchwartz, Police Indemnification, 89 N.YU. L. REV. 885, 912โ17 (2014). More, even when a \njudgment includes punitive damages, the officers themselves almost never pay any part of \n  9 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 9 of 30     Document 45\n\nthat. Schwartz, Police Indemnification at 917-18. There is no reason to think judges would be \ndifferent. At worst, civil liability would be an insurable risk for judges (or for the states that \nemploy them), altogether unlike criminal prosecution. One cannot shift to an insurer the \nloss of liberty, or stigma and lost civil liberties as a convicted felon. Even as to finality, \ncriminal prosecutions are clumsy ways to review the propriety of a judgeโs official acts, and \noften may not avoid an appeal or collateral attack by parties to the underlying case anyway.  \n  Yet it is civil immunity for judges that has grown mostโand came latest. The \nrationales for judicial immunity might have suggested just the opposite. Still, criminal \nimmunity has remained largely fixed where it was in the nineteenth century, other than \nwhere legislation under the Reconstruction Amendments, current 18 U.S.C. ยงยง 241, 242, has \ncurtailed rather than expanded it. \n  It is true, then, that the Supreme Court never yet has had occasion to apply \njudicial immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts outside the context of violating \nrights assured under the Reconstruction Amendments. But that is not because judicial \nimmunity from prosecution for official acts rightly is in question. It has not been in question \nsince the foundational English case in 1607. That likely is because the Justice Department \nunder only one president in United States history has sought to prosecute state judges for \nofficial conduct anything like that alleged here.5  \n \n5  The 2019 federal indictment of a Massachusetts state judge, Shelley Richmond Joseph, is the only case with \nremotely similar facts that Judge Dugan, the government, or the magistrate judge have found. At least on the \nresearch of the parties and the magistrate judge, every other federal prosecution of a judge since the founding \nhas arisen from palpable graft, coercive sexual gratification, or other conduct wholly unrelated to judging, \nagain outside the setting of individual constitutional rights protected by the Reconstruction Amendments. \n  10 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 10 of 30     Document 45\n\n  A paucity of opportunities to apply judicial immunity to criminal prosecution \nfor official acts is not empirical evidence that the law withholds that immunity, then. \nInstead, it is a reminder that the law so long has extended immunity to official acts untainted \nby graft or self-gratification that federal prosecutors rarely have been reckless enough to \nattempt such a prosecution. \n  Fundamentally, the magistrate judge is wrong in asserting that while โLord \nCokeโs pronouncements have taken root in American common law regarding judicial \nimmunity in civil cases, the same cannot be said regarding criminal prosecutions.โ Report \n& Recommendation at 16 (italics in original). Civil immunity has taken root, that much is \nright; but criminal immunity for a judgeโs official acts is the very soil in which that civil \nimmunity is rooted. We are not awaiting the Supreme Courtโs extension or expansion of \ncivil immunity to criminal immunity. Contra Report & Recommendation at 36; see also id. at \n26. Civil immunity is itself the extension and expansion. \n2.  The Exception for Official Acts Violating Statutes Enacted Pursuant To The \nReconstruction Amendments Proves the General Rule. \n \n    All parties recognize that Congress does have the power to abrogate judicial \nimmunity  pursuant  to  the  enforcement  clauses  of  the  Thirteenth,  Fourteenth,  and \nFifteenth Amendments. See OโShea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (denying injunctive \nrelief and observing, โJudges who would willfully discriminate on the ground of race or \notherwise  would  willfully  deprive  the  citizen  of  his  constitutional  rights,  as  this \ncomplaint alleges, must take account of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242โ); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, \n428โ29 (1976) (recognizing civil immunity but observing, โEven judges, cloaked with \nabsolute  civil  immunity  for  centuries,  could  be  punished  criminally  for  willful \n  11 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 11 of 30     Document 45\n\ndeprivations of constitutional rights on the strength of 18 U.S.C. ยง 242, [ ] the criminal \nanalog of ยง 1983โ) (note omitted).  \n    That exception proves the rule. The Reconstruction Amendments changed \nthe constitutional order and gave Congress power to criminalize official state conduct \nthat would have been unthinkable to the founders; unthinkable as a civil war itself. \n    And  this  new,  extraordinary  power  was  limited  to  statutes  enacted \npursuant to the Reconstruction Amendments, such as 18 U.S.C. ยง 242. As to ordinary \ncriminal statutes like those at issue here enacted under Article I powers that remain \nunamended since the framing, Congress lacks any comparable power to criminalize the \nofficial  acts  of  state  officials,  judges  included.  The  distinction  not  only  reflects  our \nnational history in which official acts in some states were abused to deny civil rights, but \nis critical to protecting individual liberty. It is one thing to empower federal prosecutors \nto ensure that state officials do not deny rights guaranteed to the People. It is quite \nanother thing to empower federal prosecutors to arrest and prosecute state judges who \ndo not stand accused of violating anyoneโs civil rights, but of interfering with federal law \nenforcement priorities. The latter is far more threatening to the federal-state balance and \nnot within scope of the Reconstruction Amendments.   \n    Although both the Court and the parties must take Ex Parte Virginia, 100 \nU.S. 339 (1880), on its own terms, the case would have been better framed as a recognition \nof congressional power under the Reconstruction Amendments to enact new federal \ncrimes and apply them to state judges who violate the individual rights that those \namendments protect. There, a state judge faced federal prosecution for excluding Black \n  12 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 12 of 30     Document 45\n\nprospective jurors. On a pretrial petition for a writ of habeas corpus, he raised a judicial \nimmunity bar, arguing that โCongress cannot punish a State judge for his official acts.โ \nEx  Parte  Virginia,  100  U.S.  at  348.  The  Court  disagreed,  because  of  the  Fourteenth \nAmendment. Id. at 349. Even beyond that, the judgeโs act was โoutside of his authority \nand in direct violation of the spirit of the State statute.โ Id. The exclusion of Black jurors \nsimply because they were Black โwas not left within the limits of his discretionโ under \nstate law. Id. \n    The Court in effect ducked the judicial immunity challenge by holding that \nthe judgeโs acts were โministerial,โ not judicial acts at all. Id. at 348. It ducked again in \nholding that not even state law permitted the judge to exclude Black jurors.6 Here, the \nmagistrate judge misreads Ex Parte Virginia. The Court did not, as she says, hold that, \nโeven if the act was judicial, the judge had no authority to select jurors in violation of the \nConstitution.โ Report & Recommendation at 14. It could have, but did not. Rather, it held \nthat state law gave the judge no authority to exclude Black jurors, which underscored the \nconclusion that his acts were not judicial at all. \n     So the case, on its holding, goes squarely into the category of unofficial acts, \nfor which judges have no criminal immunity. It would have fit better in the category of \nofficial acts that violate individual rights under the Fourteenth Amendment, and thus do \nnot enjoy criminal immunity even though official. In any event, the Court allowed the \n \n6  Of course it is chancy and maybe nearly idle to second-guess a 145-year old decision with wispy reasoning; \nunderstood. But that said, Ex Parte Virginia was a U.S. Supreme Court decision directly concerning a state judge \ncharged with a federal crime for the way in which he selected jurors and jury pools. It would have been easy \nenough for the Court just to say there is no criminal judicial immunity, ever, if the Report & Recommendation \nis right. That would have ended Ex Parte Virginia, were it so. \n  13 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 13 of 30     Document 45\n\njudgeโs prosecution to go forward under a post-Reconstruction statute that rested on the \nenforcement clause of the Fourteenth Amendment for its legitimacy. Ex Parte Virginia, \n100 U.S. at 349. \n    That leaves all other official acts. They continue to fall within judicial \nimmunity, including in criminal cases, as they long have. Again, the magistrate judge has \nthe relationship between criminal and civil judicial immunity backwards. \n3.  There is No Serious Line-Drawing Problem Between Genuinely Official Acts \nand Unofficial Acts that Exploit a Judicial Office. \n \na.  Unofficial Acts Cases.  \n      Recognizing judicial immunity for official acts poses no threat to \nfederal  criminal  prosecutions  targeting  graft  or  sexual  misconduct.  Indeed,  federal \nprosecutions of sitting members of Congress for such conduct have peacefully co-existed \nwith the Speech or Debate Clause. Sexual misconduct or privately distributing child \npornography are as unofficial as they get, and it is well-established that bribery can be \nprosecuted by targeting the corrupt promise rather than the official act of casting a vote. \nSee, e.g., United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 526 (1972) (prosecution of former U.S. \nSenator; taking a bribe not a legislative act). \n      The largest set of those unofficial acts cases is easy and obvious: there \nis no immunity for murder, sexual assault, distributing child pornography through a \nmessaging app, tax evasion, drunk driving and so on, no matter if a judge does it. See \nDefendantโs Memorandum at 11-14 (Dkt. 21); Defendantโs Reply Memorandum at 2-3, 8-\n10  (Dkt.  28).  For  an  additional  colorful  Wisconsin  case  that  Judge  Dugan  did  not \npreviously cite, see United States v. Raineri, 670 F.2d 702 (7th Cir. 1982) (Iron County judge \n  14 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 14 of 30     Document 45\n\nprosecuted for a variety of federal crimes in connection with running a prostitution ring \nthrough a Hurley strip bar in which he had extensive involvement); and see Archie v. \nLanier, 95 F.3d 438, 441 (6th Cir. 1996) (denying civil immunity claim because stalking and \nsexual assault never are judicial acts).  \n      For that matter, when someone who currently is a federal judge \ncommits perjury in a grand jury investigation of crimes before he was a judge, or chooses \nto sit privately for an FBI interview about that earlier activity and lies, these are unofficial \nacts entirely. Nothing about being a grand jury witness or a voluntary participant in an \nFBI interview has any connection to a judicial role. That was the sad coda to Otto Kerner, \nJr.โs career. See United States v. Isaacs, 493 F.2d 1124, 1132โ44 (7th Cir. 1974) (per curiam \nwith one judge dissenting in part and concurring in part and one judge dissenting).7  \n      Unofficial acts cases provide a good reminder. The term โabsolute \nimmunityโ is potentially misleading, in a judicial context or any other. Judge Dugan has \nacknowledged from the start that unofficial acts get no immunity from prosecution. \n      There  is  a  subcategory  of  these  cases  in  which  judges  faced \nprosecution for unofficial acts, but in which judicial acts were connected to the wholly \nunofficial and criminal. These are most of the graft cases collectively, and the few sexual \nassault cases where a judge used his judicial status as a means of coercion or intimidation. \n \n7 Notably, most of those unofficial act cases offer no indication that the defendant-judge even sought to raise a \njudicial immunity bar or argument. Perhaps its inapplicability was as obvious to their lawyers and them as it \nis to Judge Dugan and her lawyers. One partial exception is Isaacs. But even there, Judge Kerner argued only \nthat judicial immunity barred his prosecution until after impeachment. Isaacs, 493 F.2d at 1140-44. His indicted \nconduct was wholly unofficialโindeed, some of it preceded his time as a judgeโand the court correctly \nrejected that limited immunity argument. Just for the sake of completeness, note that the Seventh Circuit later \noverruled Isaacs on unrelated grounds, after the demise of the intangible rights theory of fraud. United States v. \nGimbel, 830 F.2d 621, 626 (7th Cir. 1987). \n  15 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 15 of 30     Document 45\n\nTo be clear, these cases all are in the category of unofficial acts and rightly so. That is \nwhere  Judge  Dugan  has  grouped  them  from  the  outset,  see  again  Defendantโs \nMemorandum at 11-14; Defendantโs Reply Memorandum at 2-3, although in her opening \nbrief she broke out this subset as a third bullet point. \n      In all of them, the promised or actual judicial act was connected but \nadjunct. Every time, some linked judicial act was held out as an inducement for a bribe \nor kickback, or as a threat by which to extort either money or the pretense of consent \n(acquiescence, not true consent) to a sexual encounter. And in each of those cases, graft \nor sexual imposition that was the gravamen of the prosecution. The indictments alleged \ngraft or coercion as their centerpiece. It was bribery, extortion, kickbacks, or assault that \nthe indictments charged, not judicial acts alone or in their own right. \n      Take United States v. Claiborne, 727 F.2d 842 (9th Cir. 1984) (per \ncuriam), where a federal judge solicited and accepted a $30,000 bribe from a Nevada \nbrothel owner to rule favorably on motions in a pending case. Judge Dugan still thinks \nthis case the closest one reported, although the magistrate judge disagrees. Report & \nRecommendation at 22-23. But Judge Dugan agrees with the magistrate judge that Harry \nClaiborne had no immunity from prosecution. The dispute with the magistrate judge \ncomes down to the gravamen of the charged crimes: whether the indicted acts were \nofficial and still got no criminal immunity, as the magistrate judge contends, or they were \nunofficial acts leveraging a promise of judicial acts, as Judge Dugan sees them.  \n      In Claiborne, the government did not accuse the judge of crimes for \nhow he handled, or intended to handle, motions and pending cases. It did not challenge \n  16 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 16 of 30     Document 45\n\nthe correctness of his judicial or official acts. No, it indicted him for soliciting a bribe, \nscheming to defraud a brothel owner, obstructing justice by urging a witness to give false \ntestimony before a grand jury, failing to report the bribes on his income tax returns, and \nfailing to disclose a loan on his financial disclosure form. Claiborne, 727 F.2d at 843 & 843 \nn.1. All of that plainly was unofficial conduct. The expected disposition of motions was \nbut the quid pro quo allegation that 18 U.S.C. ยง 201(b)(2) requires for bribery, and nothing \nmore. That is, the indictment claimed that Judge Claiborne sold his office, even if the \nhandling of motions after taking a bribe would have been in form a judicial act. Compare \nBrewster, 408 U.S. at 526 (again, taking a bribe for a later vote is not a legislative act and \ngets no immunity). \n      The  gravamen  of  the  charges  against  Harry  Claiborne  did  not \nconcern his judicial acts, then; it concerned wholly unofficial conduct, like seeking and \ntaking bribes, cheating on income taxes, suborning perjury, scheming to defraud a person \nof money, and failing to disclose a loan on a form. All of that the indictment alleged. \nJudge  Claiborne  mimicked  Judge  Kerner  before  him  in  asserting  only  that  judicial \nimmunity barred his prosecution until after his removal from office by impeachment. \nClaiborne, 727 F.2d at 843-44.8 Given the unofficial acts that were the real subject of the \nindictment, the Ninth Circuit properly rejected that limited immunity claim. \n      The โKids for Cashโ case that Judge Dugan raised and the Report & \nRecommendation discusses at pages 20โ22 and 27 is the same for these purposes. There \n \n8 The subsequent history of that case, which was an interlocutory appeal on the limited immunity argument, \nis interesting. After a first jury deadlocked, the government elected to dismiss the four bribery counts. A second \njury then acquitted Claiborne of the failure to disclose the loan, but convicted him on the two tax counts. The \nNinth Circuit affirmed the convictions. United States v. Claiborne, 765 F.2d 784 (9th Cir. 1985). \n  17 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 17 of 30     Document 45\n\nagain, the eventual indictment did not seek to punish those two Pennsylvania state judges \nfor sentencing juveniles to detention or for any other judicial act. It sought to punish them \nfor racketeering: a whole pattern of corrupt self-enrichment that exploited their judicial \nacts but as to which those acts themselves were not the gravamen of the crimes. The \njudicial acts were but the lever or means by which the judges extracted kickbacks and \nenriched themselves illicitly. \n      Contrary to the magistrate judgeโs view, then, those judges did not \nface criminal liability for โclearly judicial acts.โ Report & Recommendation at 22. They \nfaced criminal liability for a scheme of graft and racketeering that linked and exploited \ntheir  judicial  acts  as  means  of  committing  the  broader  crimes.  The  essence  of  the \nindictment there was entirely unofficial conduct, as to which official acts were but the \ninducement or predicate for the crimes. \n      In  a  sense,  that  case  anticipated  Justice  Amy  Coney  Barrettโs \nconcerns in her partial concurrence in Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024). Justice \nBarrett did not join the majorityโs conclusion that a presidentโs official acts cannot even \nbe used as evidence in prosecuting him for unofficial acts. Trump, 603 U.S. at 650-57 \n(Barrett, J., concurring in part). Relevant here, she wrote:   \nThe Constitution, of course, does not authorize a President to \nseek or accept bribes, so the Government may prosecute him \nif he does so. [ ] Yet excluding from trial any mention of the \nofficial  act  connected  to  the  bribe  would  hamstring  the \nprosecution. To make sense of charges alleging a quid pro quo, \nthe jury must be allowed to hear about both the quid and \nthe quo, even if the quo, standing alone, could not be a basis \nfor the Presidentโs criminal liability. \n \n  18 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 18 of 30     Document 45\n\nTrump,  603  U.S.  at  655-56  (Barrett,  J.,  concurring  in  part),  citing  Art. II,  ยง4  (listing \nโBriberyโ as an impeachable offense), and the Memorandum from L. Silberman, Deputy \nAtty. Gen., to R. Burress, Office of the President, Re: Conflict of Interest Problems Arising \nOut of the Presidentโs Nomination of Nelson A. Rockefeller To Be Vice President Under \nthe Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the Constitution 5 (Aug. 28, 1974) (suggesting that the \nfederal bribery statute applies to the President). \n      The jury in the โKids for Cashโ case logically did hear, and rightly \nshould have heard, testimony about sentences to detention and efforts to bully probation \nagents. That evidence did not make official acts the essence of the prosecution; it only \nhelped prove the clearly unofficial graft. In the same way, Justice Barrett agreed that a \npresident cannot be prosecuted for, say, granting a pardon, even corruptly. That is an \nofficial act, regardless of motive. But she was right: he could be prosecuted for taking a \nbribe. And if the bribe related to the official act of a pardon, in her view a jury properly \ncould hear evidence of the pardon in deciding the bribery charge. \n      The same is true as to judges tried for wholly unofficial acts like graft \nor coerced sex. The indictment can include, and the jury can hear, the collateral official \nacts. But it is not asked to convict, and cannot be, for those official acts. It is asked to \nconvict on the unofficial acts that the official acts were used to induce or procure. \n      In the end, the magistrate judge misunderstands the โKids for Cashโ \ncase and others like it involving graft. The โKids for Cashโ case indeed may be an \nexample of how the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have over-extended civil \n  19 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 19 of 30     Document 45\n\njudicial immunity. But that case does not establish, or fairly suggest, that the original \ncriminal judicial immunity from which civil immunity grew does not exist. \nb.  This Case. \n      This case stands in sharp contrast to the unofficial acts cases, both \nthose that had no connection at all to a judgeโs official role and those that did. Here, the \ngovernment offers nothing in the indictment other than official acts. On this narrow \npoint, the magistrate judge is exactly right: once more, everything the indictment alleges \nhere was an official act, or as the magistrate judge puts it, โall part of a judgeโs job.โ \nReport & Recommendation at 30. \n      This  indictment  does  not  claim,  or  even  hint  at,  bribe-seeking, \nextortion, kickbacks, theft, or graft of any kind. It does not describe any such acts. In fact, \nit includes nothing suggesting self-interest at all; no act beyond the official.  \n      So when the magistrate judge then moves on more broadly just a \nparagraph later to assert that, โAt bottom, the indictment does not charge Dugan for \nโopining on the fly,โ managing her courtroom, or allowing someone to appear by Zoom \nfor future hearings,โ Report & Recommendation at 30, she is flatly wrong. That quite \nliterally is what this indictment does charge in Count 2, the felony charge. See Indictment \n(Dkt. 6), Count 2.9  \n      More importantly, it is all that the indictment charges as to acts. \nThese are judicial acts, official acts, and they may not be prosecuted as crimes. The acts \nthemselves are immune, because they are official judicial acts and no more. There is no \n \n9 Count 1, the misdemeanor, does not offer even that much. It claims only concealment of E.F.R., and alleges \nno specific acts at all. \n  20 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 20 of 30     Document 45\n\nallegation of a crooked quid pro quo or other illegal act. The official acts are the gravamen, \nindeed the whole, of this indictment. That sets this case apart from all unofficial acts cases. \n      And it is why the indictmentโs rote inclusion of the statutory mens \nrea element, โcorruptly,โ does not salvage it, despite the magistrate judgeโs view. See \nReport & Recommendation at 29, 30. Judge Dugan is immune from prosecution for these \nofficial acts. As to that reality of an immunity bar, judicial immunity is no different than \nthe presidential immunity that arose from earlier judicial immunity cases: there can be \nno inquiry into motives, if the acts themselves are official and immune. The prosecution \nis barred at the outset. See Trump, 603 U.S. at 618. \n      There is no serious line-drawing problem, then, between the official \nand the unofficial. That means there also is no line-drawing problem as to judicial \nimmunity and lack of judicial immunity, because it is easy enough to discern when an \nindictment alleges that official acts violated constitutional rights that the Thirteenth, \nFourteenth,  or  Fifteenth  Amendments  assure.  The  magistrate  judgeโs  parade  of \nhorriblesโโmust  Congress  comb  through  every  federal  criminal  statute  to  indicate \nwhich statutes apply to judges and which do not?,โ Report & Recommendation at 14โis \neasily ended. The answer is no: all federal crimes apply to the unofficial acts of judges, \nand none of them apply to a judgeโs official acts unless those official acts fall within 18 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 241 or 242 because they violate the Reconstruction Amendments.  \n      This indictment does not concern any right that the Thirteenth, \nFourteenth, or Fifteenth Amendments protect. It does not concern any individual right, \nperiod. Rather, it is limited to official acts affecting federal executive policies.  \n  21 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 21 of 30     Document 45\n\n      Even the law review article that the magistrate judge thrice cites, \nReport  &  Recommendation  at  4,  5,  17,  supports  immunity  from  prosecution  here, \nnotwithstanding its pinched view of criminal immunity for judges generally. See Jeffrey \nM. Shaman, Judicial Immunity from Civil and Criminal Liability, 27 SAN DIEGO L. REV. 1, 18 \n(1990) (โThe one area where judges can be said to enjoy immunity from criminal liability \nis for malfeasance or misfeasance in the performance of judicial tasks undertaken in good \nfaithโ). The indictment here charges nothing but the performance of judicial tasks, and \nother  than  bare  repetition  of  the  statutory  mental  elements  of  โcorruptlyโ  and \nโknowinglyโ offers nothing to suggest bad faith. For that matter, a bar like immunity \noperates at the outset to foreclose factual inquiry into motives and good or bad faith \nassessments. Anyway, it is not clear from the indictment that the alleged acts even would \nrise to the level of misfeasance, let alone malfeasance. \n    In all, Judge Dugan has judicial immunity from prosecution on both counts \nof this indictment. The magistrate judge is mistaken. \nB.  The Tenth Amendment. \n  The  Report  &  Recommendation  also  missed  the  importance  of  the  Tenth \nAmendment here. Until the Reconstruction Amendments and their separate enforcement \nclauses, Congress had no power to abrogate judicial immunity as to federal prosecutions of \nstate officials who acted under color of state law, including judges. The Reconstruction \nAmendment enforcement clauses changed that; they ceded new power to Congress. But \nwhen Congress passes criminal laws pursuant to its ordinary Article I powers, it enjoys no \ncomparable extraordinary power to punish criminally the official acts of state judges or \n  22 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 22 of 30     Document 45\n\nofficials. This case involves only statutes passed pursuant to Congressโ Article I powers, and \nthere is no indication that Congress imagined it was reaching official judicial acts, let alone \ntrying to abrogate immunity for those acts. \n  Again, this case does not concern an alleged violation of any right that the Thirteenth, \nFourteenth, or Fifteenth Amendments protect. It is outside the ambit of Congressโ powers \nunder those amendments. So, Judge Dugan necessarily returns to the Tenth Amendment. \n  Just as its structure implies a horizontal separation of powers, the Constitutionโs \nstructure also establishes a vertical separation of powers.10 Federal law is supreme in its \nallocated realm. U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 2. There, it tops any state law to the contrary. But its \nrealm is limited and explicitly demarcated. The statesโor the people at baseโretain all \npowers not allocated expressly to the federal government. No sovereign, neither federal nor \nthe many states, is subordinate to another. Yet the federal and state governments are \nseparated vertically, so to speak, with each bound to respect the otherโs realm.  \n  The Tenth Amendment is the most explicit assertion of this vertical separation of \npowers. It reads in full: \nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor \nprohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the \npeople. \n \nU.S. CONST. amend. X. \n \n10 While still at the University of Wisconsin Law School, Professor Victoria Nourse was first to make popular \nuse of this term in a context broader than, but including, the one Judge Dugan describes here. See Victoria \nNourse, The Vertical Separation of Powers, 49 DUKE L.J. 749 (1999). Nourse borrowed the term from Justice \nKennedy. See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.S. 417, 452 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring); Nourse, Vertical \nSeparation of Powers, 49 DUKE L.J. at 751 n. 10. \n  23 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 23 of 30     Document 45\n\n  Specifically, the Constitutionโs vertical separation of powers means the Court now \nmust assess whether the federal government, through its executive branch, has lawful \npower to exact criminal punishment from Judge Dugan for doing in and near her courtroom \nas the indictment contends. This is the core question here under the Tenth Amendment.  \n  That  is,  has  the  federal  government  constitutional  power  to  command  a  state \ngovernment officer not to do as it alleges Judge Dugan did in the discharge of her official \nduties under state law? To tell her, no, you cannot muse that a judicial warrant is necessary \nto arrest someone in your state courthouse; no, you cannot send federal agents down the \nhall to confer with the chief judge; no, you cannot handle a routine court appearance off the \nrecord and while some agents are not directly outside your courtroom in the hallway; no, \nyou cannot usher a person out a second door so that he re-enters the same hallway a few \nfeet from the doors agents expected him to use; and no, you cannot allow a party in a \npending case to make future court appearances by Zoom? More, can the federal government \ninsist that a state judge answer federal criminal charges if she does any or all of those things? \n  It cannot. The federal government does not count this power among those delegated \nto it under the Constitution. While a state judge is bound by federal law in deciding cases, \nTesta v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386, 392โ94 (1947), the issues here are not about properly honoring \nfederal  law  when  state  law  conflicts  with  it.  The  Supremacy  Clause  and  the  Tenth \nAmendment are part of the same Constitution. A federal assertion of power that offends the \nTenth Amendment enjoys no supremacy. \n  Nothing in the Constitution allows the federal government to superintend the \nadministration  and  case-by-case,  daily  functioning  of  state  courts  as  this  indictment \n  24 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 24 of 30     Document 45\n\nproposes. Even less has the federal government the power to supersede the judgment of \nstate judges in and near their courtrooms, on prosaic matters like the indictment alleges. \nState law provides and controls that power. \n  Consider the brief opinion in Page Co. v. MacDonald, 261 U.S. 446 (1923). There a \nresident of Ontario, Canada, brought suit against a corporation in Massachusetts state court. \nThe corporation then sued her in federal court in Massachusetts, claiming that her state \naction was libelous. The corporation served her with the federal summons and complaint \nwhile she was attending the state court case. She pleaded in abatement, alleging statutory \nimmunity from service while attending a court proceeding. \n  The Supreme Court sustained her claim of immunity from service of process under \nthose  circumstances.  That  immunity  was  founded  on  โthe  necessities  of  the  judicial \nadministration,โ and both federal and state courts have equal interest in those necessities. \nPage  Co.,  261  U.S.  at  448.  The  federal  government  could  not  claim  that  its  judicial \nadministration interests overrode the stateโs judicial administration interests in its own \ncourts. In effect, that is exactly what the federal executive branch claims here. \n  And this indictment arises in the context of ordinary state judicial and criminal \nenforcement proceedings. Empirically, almost all criminal cases are in state courts in this \ncountry, under state law. That is a natural consequence of the fact that the states retain the \ngeneral police power: they did not delegate that power to the federal government, although \nvalid  federal  powers  sometimes  may  produce  similar  results.  Hamilton  v.  Kentucky \nDistilleries & Warehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146, 156 (1919) (Brandeis, J.); see also Berman v. Parker, \n348 U.S. 26, 32 (1954) (explaining breadth of โpolice powerโ).  \n  25 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 25 of 30     Document 45\n\n  This case, involving the routine work of a state court and judge, is quite unlike the \npeculiar power of the federal government to control adoption of Indian children in state \ncourts  through  the  Indian  Child  Welfare  Act,  even  though  marriage,  adoption,  and \ndomestic relations generally are reserved to states. See Haaland v. Brackeen, 599 U.S. 255, 272โ\n91 (2023) (ICWA does not violate anti-commandeering doctrine of Tenth Amendment \nbecause of Congressโs express, plenary authority under Article I, ยง 1 to legislate with respect \nto Indian tribes; rejecting Tenth Amendment arguments in the specific context of adoption \nof Indian children). The federal government has no similar grant of authority here that \nwould give it the control that this indictment asserts. \n  Judge Dugan instead had that authority and control. She is a duly elected Wisconsin \nstate judge, WIS. CONST. art. VII, ยง 7, and here was performing duties that both Wisconsin \nlaw and her chief judge assigned. WIS. STAT. ยงยง 753.03, 757.01, WIS. SCR 70.19(3)(a). The state \nhas a comprehensive system for correcting errors on direct appeal or by writ. WIS. STAT. chs. \n808, 809. It has a code of judicial ethics. WIS. SCR Ch. 60. It has a rule giving judges control \nover courthouse security. WIS. SCR 68.04. It has an established judicial disciplinary body, \nthe Judicial Commission. That Commission has the power to enforce ethical requirements. \nWIS. CONST. art VII, ยง 11; WIS. STAT. ยง 757.83; WIS. ADMIN. CODE ยงยง JC 1 through JC 6. The \njudicial  disciplinary  process  under  state  law  extends  to  the  conduct  alleged  in  this \nindictment. WIS. SCR 60.02, 60.03; WIS. ADMIN. CODE ยง JC 3.07.11 And Wisconsin allows \nremoval of judges by impeachment, recall, or address. WIS. CONST. art. VII, ยงยง 1, 11, 13. \n \n11 The Wisconsin Supreme Court already has invoked its disciplinary power by suspending Judge \nDugan during the pendency of this case. \n  26 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 26 of 30     Document 45\n\n  All of these means of filling the state judiciary, overseeing it, and disciplining it are \nsquarely within the powers that states retain under the U.S. Constitution. The states \ndelegated the federal government no power to interfere with or replace state powerโand \nstate lawโas to any of these functions. For that matter, again, Congress never has claimed \nthat it was exercising any such claimed power in enacting the two statutes at issue here. \n  This case fits the reasoning of Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991), then. There, the \nSupreme Court held that, in the absence of a plain statement by Congress, the Court would \nnot apply the ADEA to state court judges because it was โat least ambiguous whether \nCongress intended that appointed judges . . . be includedโ in that federal age discrimination \nlaw. Gregory, 501 U.S. at 470. Without a plain statement of congressional intent, Gregory \nrelied on the long line of cases recognizing โthe authority of the people of the States to \ndetermine the qualifications of their most important government officials.โ Id. at 463. That \nauthority lies at the heart of representative government, Gregory noted, and โis a power \nreserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment.โ Id. \nC. Constitutional Avoidance. \n  The indictmentโs reference to the unusual mental element of the crime charged in \nCount 2, โcorruptly,โ and its mention of a โproceedingโ both leave ambiguity. The \nmagistrate judge herself implicitly acknowledges the ambiguity as to the mens rea element \nof Count 2: she proposes that a jury can decide whether Judge Dugan acted corruptly or \nโwas merely performing her judicial duties.โ Report & Recommendation at 32. Again \nimplicitly in the magistrate judgeโs view, Judge Dugan would be guilty if the former, but \nnot guilty if the latter. Yet the magistrate judge offers no explanation of how a jury would \n  27 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 27 of 30     Document 45\n\ndistinguish  those  two  things  or  what  โcorruptlyโ  might  mean  here.  The  term \nโproceedingโ  also  remains  wholly  undefined,  even  by  alleged  example,  and  the \ngovernment  has  been  coy  about  what  โproceedingโ  it  claims  was  at  issue.  See \nGovernment Response at 23-24 (Dkt. 25). In both places, the canon of constitutional \navoidance would have a proper role in resolving the ambiguity. \n  Indeed, just last year, the Supreme Court rejected an effort by federal prosecutors \nto expand criminal activity by invoking a vague definition of corruptly and leaving it to \nthe jury to sort out later whether a particular arrangement was corrupt. In Snyder v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 1 (2024), the Supreme Court limited 18 U.S.C. ยง 666 to true quid pro quo \nbribery and rejected the governmentโs effort to extend the statute to corrupt or wrongful \ngratuities for past official acts. The Court faulted the government for failing to present a \nworkable definition of โcorruptly,โ Snyder, 603 U.S. at 15-16, and underscored that, for a \nstatute that applies to countless state and local officials, the government needs to give \nmore clear notice of what conduct was criminal. Id. at 15-16. \n  The same logic applies here. No one alleges that Judge Duganโs conduct was \nwrong or corrupt in the sense of quid pro quo corruption. An effort to extend the statutes \nhereโwhich have endless applications that do not implicate judicial conductโto official \njudicial actions with no more clarity or protection than a jury instruction on โcorruptlyโ \ncannot help but affect judicial actions adversely and upset the state-federal balance. \n  Moreover, as the Supreme Court underscored in Snyder, courts cannot construe \ncriminal  statutes  on  the  assumption  that  federal  prosecutors  will  employ  their \n  28 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 28 of 30     Document 45\n\nprosecutorial discretion responsibly and focus on the most serious cases. See id. at 17. \nThey do not always do that, as this case proves. \n  If the Court cannot avoid the constitutional issues and the bar to prosecution that \nJudge Dugan asserts, then concededly there is no role for this canon. Dismissal on either \njudicial  immunity  or  Tenth  Amendment  grounds  would  moot  the  doctrine  of \nconstitutional avoidance. Judge Dugan otherwise stands on her earlier briefing. See \nDefendantโs Memorandum at 33-35 (Dkt. 21); Defendantโs Reply at 13-14 (Dkt. 28). \n \nIII. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n \n  The federal government has no right or power to prosecute a state judge for the five \nacts or decisions that this indictment alleges. It never has. The issue at bottom is not that the \nSupreme Court never clearly has extended immunity for official judicial acts to criminal \nprosecution. That Court repeatedly has recognized and endorsed common law judicial \nimmunity from criminal prosecution for official acts, outside individual rights under the \nReconstruction Amendments. Indeed, the Supreme Court has extended criminal immunity \nto civil immunity as well. \n  Neither count in this indictment can stand. Both are barred by judicial immunity \ntoday, just as at this nationโs founding. The Tenth Amendment confirms that. \nDated at Madison, Wisconsin, July 15, 2025. \n \n \n  29 \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/15/25     Page 29 of 30     Document 45\n\n            Respectfully submitted, \n            HON.

      "text": "UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \n \n        Plaintiff, \n \n  v.              Case No. 25-CR-89 (LA) \n \nHANNAH C. DUGAN, \n \nDefendant. \n \n \nRESPONSE TO DEFENDANTโS OBJECTIONS \nTO MAGISTRATE JUDGEโS REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \n \n \n  The United States of America, by Acting United States Attorney Richard G. \nFrohling, hereby responds to defendant Hannah C. Duganโs objections to the \nMagistrate Judgeโs Report and Recommendation. For the following reasons, and \nthose stated in the report and the governmentโs prior response, this Court should \noverrule Duganโs objections and deny her motion to dismiss. \nINTRODUCTION \n \nDugan faces a two-count indictment alleging that on April 18, 2025, she \nattempted to unlawfully prevent the arrest of โE.F.R.,โ who was wanted on a \nfederal immigration warrant for โpurposes of removal proceedings conducted by \nthe United States Department of Homeland Security.โ (Dkt. 6.) More particularly, \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 1 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nthe indictment alleges that Dugan, upon learning that federal agents planned to \nexecute the warrant in the Milwaukee County Courthouse: \nknowingly concealed E.F.R. to prevent his discovery and arrest on a \nwarrant, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1071 (Count One); and \n \ncorruptly  endeavored  to  influence,  obstruct,  and  impede  E.F.R.โs \narrest on a warrant by committing affirmative acts to assist E.F.R. in \nevading such arrest, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505 (Count Two). \n \n(Dkt. 6.)  \nThe affirmative acts alleged in Count Two include: \na.  confronting  members  of  a  United  States  Immigration  and \nCustoms Enforcement (ICE) Task Force and falsely telling them \nthey needed a judicial warrant to effectuate the arrest of E.F.R.; \n \nb.  upon  learning  that  they  had  an  administrative  warrant  for \nE.F.R.โs arrest, directing all identified members of the ICE Task \nForce  to  leave  the  location  of  the  planned  arrest  (a  public \nhallway outside of Courtroom 615 of the Milwaukee County \nCourthouse) and go to the Chief Judgeโs office; \n \nc.  addressing E.F.R.โs Milwaukee County Circuit Court criminal \ncase off the record while ICE Task Force members were in the \nChief Judgeโs office; \n \nd.  directing E.F.R. and his counsel to exit Courtroom 615 through \na non-public jury door; and \n \ne.  advising E.F.R.โs counsel that E.F.R. could appear by โZoomโ \nfor his next court date. \n(Dkt. 6 at 2.) \n2 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 2 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nDugan moved to dismiss the indictment based on judicial immunity, and \nalternatively,  because  of  the  โvertical  separation  of  powersโ  in  the  Tenth \nAmendment. See Dkt. 15, 21, 45. More particularly, Dugan argued that she is \nentitled to absolute immunity from prosecution, claiming that the common law \npermits only three categories of crimes against judges, that none of them is charged \nhere, and that she must avoid trial altogether. And citing the Tenth Amendment, \nshe argued that the federal government lacks authority to prosecute state-court \njudges for official acts. See id. \nIn response, the government explained that judges have immunity from \ncivil suit but not from federal criminal prosecution, and if judicial immunity \napplies at all, it immunizes only โjudicial acts,โ which does not help Dugan \nbecause she acted outside her official role. See Dkt. 28 at 8-20. The government also \nexplained that the Tenth Amendment provides no personal immunity and does \nnot prevent the prosecution of state officials, including judges, for violating federal \nlaw.  \nIn  a  37-page  report,  Magistrate  Judge  Joseph  thoroughly  analyzed  the \npartiesโ submissions. See Dkt. 43. Judge Joseph applied the proper standard of \nreview, namely, that the indictmentโs allegations are presumed true and viewed \nmost favorably to the government. Next, after an exhaustive review of the history \nof judicial immunity, she found no authority to bar this prosecution and rejected \n3 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 3 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nDuganโs argument as an unprecedented and unauthorized expansion of judicial \nimmunity outside its historical civil-law context. The magistrate judge also found \nthat Duganโs reliance on the Tenth Amendment and the principle of constitutional \navoidance was misplaced. \nDugan  now  has  objected,  essentially  repeating  the  arguments  that  the \nmagistrate judge rejected. For the reasons set forth below, because the magistrate \njudgeโs  analysis  was  comprehensive  and  correct,  the  Court  should  overrule \nDuganโs objections and deny her motion pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 59(b)(3). \nARGUMENT \nI.  The doctrine of judicial immunity applies to civil suits but does not shield \nDugan from criminal liability for the acts alleged in the indictment.  \n \nIn her objections, Dugan asserts that she is beyond the reach of statutes that \napply to ordinary citizens who obstruct federal arrests because, unlike them, she \nis entitled to immunity for her โofficial actsโ as a Wisconsin state court judge. (Dkt. \n45  at  1.)  In  particular,  Dugan  claims  that  the  magistrate  judgeโs  report  and \nrecommendation  โclash[es]  with  first  principlesโ  and  a  doctrine  of  judicial \nimmunity that dates back โfour centuries,โ as well as the Supreme Courtโs recent \ndecision in Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024). (Dkt. 45 at 2-3, 8.)  \nDugan is wrong about the application and scope of judicial immunity. In \nthe simplest terms, to quote the magistrate judge: โ[J]udges are not immune from \n4 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 4 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \ncriminal prosecution for acts wholly outside their official roles as judges,โ and \neven when a judgeโs actions are โrelated to official duties,โ there is no immunity \nfor conduct that violates the criminal law. (Dkt. 43 at 26-27.) Instead, โgenerally, a \njudge is immune from a suit for money damagesโ for judicial acts. Mireles v. Waco, \n502 U.S. 9 (1991) (per curiam) (emphasis added). The protection of judges from \ncivil liability arose because it was in the public interest to have judges who were \nat liberty to exercise their independent judgment about the merits of a case without \nfear.โ Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24, 31 (1980). But it does not protect judges from \nprosecution for their official acts. \nTo the contrary, the Supreme Court long โhas recognized that a judge is not \nabsolutely immune from criminal liability.โ Mireles, 502 U.S. at 10 n.1 (citing Ex \nparte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339, 348-49 (1880)). In fact, the Supreme Court has made \nclear that โthe judicially fashioned doctrine of official immunity does not reach so far as \nto immunize criminal conduct proscribed by an Act of Congress.โ OโShea v. Littleton, 414 \nU.S. 488, 503 (1974) (cleaned up; emphasis added). The Court โhas never suggested \nthat  the  policy  considerations  which  compel  civil  immunity  for  certain \ngovernmental officials also place them beyond the reach of the criminal law. Even \n5 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 5 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \njudges, cloaked with absolute civil immunity for centuries, could be punished \ncriminally.โ Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 428-29 (1976).1 \nGiven the pronouncements from the Supreme Court, it is no surprise that \nmany cases have been prosecuted against judges who violate criminal statutes. See \nDkt. 28 at 9-11 (collecting cases); see also United States v. Joseph, et al., 2020 WL \n4288425 (D. Mass. July 27, 2020) (rejecting similar arguments for dismissal). Dugan \nattempts to explain away the absence of cases supporting her position by arguing \nthat judicial immunity from criminal prosecution is so entrenched that it has \nalways applied, and no extension from civil law is needed. See Dkt. 45 at 14 \n(claiming โthe magistrate judge has the relationship between criminal and civil \njudicial immunity backwardsโ). \nDuganโs repetition of the same arguments that she made to the magistrate \njudge fails to demonstrate error in the report and recommendation. The magistrate \n \n1Imbler and OโShea are discussed below in connection with Duganโs argument about \nabrogation of immunity in Section 242. Dugan previously criticized the government for \nnot including references to Section 242 when citing these cases. See Dkt. 38 at 3 n. 1. To be \nclear,  these  cases,  which  involved  immunity  under  Section  1983,  referenced  the \npossibility of criminal liability for civil rights violations under Section 242. In so doing, \nhowever, they did not suggest that Section 242 was an exception to a broader rule of \njudicial immunity for criminal conduct. The idea behind the Courtโs references to Section \n242 was to illustrate that immunity in the civil contextโ for civil rights violationsโwould \nnot necessarily mean that such violations went unpunished. In this context, it was only \nnatural for the Court to reference Section 242, which it described as โthe criminal analog \nto ยง 1983.โ Imbler, 424 U.S. at 429. \n \n6 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 6 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \njudge exhaustively analyzed relevant authorities, examining the cases cited above \nand others that were decided before and after the nationโs founding through the \nmodern era. The judge also examined the civil-rights statutes and common law on \nwhich Dugan relies. The judge considered Duganโs related contention that only \nthree categories of crimes may be pursued against judges, none of which are \ncharged here. (Dkt. 43 at 5-27.) Having done so, the magistrate judge definitively \nrejected Duganโs arguments for dismissal. (Dkt. 43 at 27.) \nIn her objections, Dugan relies heavily on Floyd v. Barker, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305, \n1307 (Star Chamber 1607). However, as the magistrate judge recognized, Floyd has \nno discernible effect on the question of judicial criminal immunity in this case. \n(Dkt. 43 at 4.) Floyd involved an unusual collision between the Court of the Star \nChamber  and  the  common-law  courts  of  Jacobean  England.  Lord  Coke \ndetermined that a claim of conspiracy brought against a judge of the Courts of \nAssize โfor any thing done by him as Judgeโ while trying a murder case was โnot \nexaminable in the Star-Chamber,โ because both the Star Chamber and the Courts \nof Assize drew their authority from the King and therefore only โthe King himselfโ \ncould review the judgeโs actions. Floyd, 77 Eng. Rep. at 1307. Allowing each of the \nKingโs courts to superintend the others in such a manner, Lord Coke reasoned, \nwould โtend[] to the slander of the justice of the Kingโ and thereby โscandal of the \nKing himselfโ; result in โcontinual calumniationsโ that would โsubver[t]โ the \n7 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 7 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nKingโs authority โto deliver justice  to all his subjectsโ; and usurp the Kingโs \nprerogative to supervise his judges. Id.  \nAccordingly, Floyd arose in an unusual legal context that has no parallel in \nmodern American lawโcertainly not in this case, involving a federal prosecution \nof a state judge for federal crimes she committed outside the scope of her judicial \nduties. To that end, the magistrate judge found only two pertinent cases where the \nSupreme Court invoked FloydโRandall v. Brigham, 74 U.S. 523 (1868), and Bradley \nv. Fisher, 80 U.S. 335 (1871). But, as the magistrate judge observed, those cases cited \nFloyd only โas authority for judicial immunity in the civil context.โ (Dkt.  43 at 13.) \nThe magistrate judge accurately remarked that, โin the 154 years since Bradley was \ndecided, Dugan does not cite, and I have not found, cases where the Supreme \nCourt invoked Floyd for the proposition that judicial immunity bars the criminal \nprosecution of judges for judicial acts.โ (Id.) Duganโs objections likewise fail to \nproduce such a case, and the government knows of none. \nSimilarly, contrary to Duganโs assertion (Dkt. 45 at 6), the Supreme Court \ndid not adopt judicial immunity in the criminal context in Spalding v. Vilas by citing \nan 1810 state civil case that mentions the word โindictment.โ See 161 U.S. 483, 494 \n(1896) (citing Yates v. Lansing, 5 Johns. 282, 291 (N.Y. 1810)). As the magistrate \njudge correctly recognized, isolated statements in civil cases โ like Spalding or the \nsmattering of lower-court decisions that Dugan cites โ provide โweak supportโ \n8 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 8 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nfor Duganโs assertion โof a well-establishedโ doctrine of judicial immunity from \nprosecution. (Dkt. 43 at 17). And interpreting them that way would be at odds with \nthe Supreme Courtโs statements rejecting judicial immunity for criminal acts. See \nOโShea, 414 U.S. at 503; Imbler, 424 U.S. at 428-29. \nIn response to the magistrate courtโs well-reasoned explanation of why \nmodern Supreme Court decisions likewise do not support her claim of judicial \nimmunity, see Dkt. 43 at 6-13 (discussing Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967); Nixon \nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731 (1982); Stump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978); Dennis, 449 \nU.S. 24; Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988); Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991); and \nUnited States v. Trump, 603 U.S. 593, 630 (2024)), Duganโs objection cites only \nTrump.  \nTrump is clearly distinguishable. That decision held that the President has \ncriminal immunity for official acts based on the presidencyโs โunique position in \nthe constitutional schemeโ and the โunique risks to the effective functioning of \ngovernmentโ if Presidents were forced to constantly assess whether their decision-\nmaking while in office might one day prompt criminal inquiries. 603 U.S. at 611, \n613. Applying Trump outside the presidential context to the tens of thousands of \npeople across the country who serve in โjudicialโ roles would be an unwarranted \nand baseless extension. As the magistrate judge explained: โWhile Dugan asserts \nthat Trump simply extended to the President the same immunity from prosecution \n9 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 9 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nthat judges already have, this argument makes a leap too far. Trump says nothing \nabout criminal immunity for judicial acts.โ (Dkt. 43 at 25.) \nConsistent  with  the  magistrate  judgeโs  analysis,  judges  have  been \nprosecuted in dozens of cases for a wide range of criminal conduct, including \nobstruction. See, e.g., Kugler v. Helfant, 421 U.S. 117 (1975) (judge indicted on \ncharges of obstruction and lying to a grand jury); United States v. Cochran, 682 F. \nAppโx  828  (11th  Cir.  2017)  (affirming  state  judgeโs  conviction  for  witness \ntampering in violation of ยง 1512); United States v. Baumgartner, 581 F. Appโx 522 \n(6th Cir. 2014) (affirming state judgeโs conviction for misprision); United States v. \nGrubb, 11 F.3d 426 (4th Cir. 1993) (affirming state court judgeโs conviction under ยง \n1503 for obstructing grand jury investigation); United States v. Claiborne, 727 F.2d \n842, 843 n.1 (9th Cir. 1984) (judge prosecuted for urging a grand jury witness to lie, \nin violation of ยง 1503); United States v. Ash, No. 19-mj-9341-UA (S.D.N.Y. filed Oct. \n4, 2019) (state court judge prosecuted under ยง 1512); United States v. Moreland, \nCrim. No. 17-00066 (M.D. Tenn. May 24, 2018) (state court judge convicted under \nยง 1512); United States v. Walker, Crim. No. 14-00093-DCB-FKB (S.D. Miss. Oct. 7, \n2014) (state court judge convicted under ยง 1512); United States v. DeLaughter, Crim. \nNo. 09-0002-GHD-SAA (N.D. Miss. July 30, 2009) (state court judge convicted \nunder ยง 1512 for lying to FBI about case in which he made rulings favorable at the \nrequest of a friend); see also Dkt. 28 at 9-11 (collecting cases). \n10 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 10 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nDugan faults  the  magistrate  judge  for  followingโand  would  have this \nCourt ignoreโthe Supreme Court and modern practice. She suggests that the \nSupreme Courtโs statements in OโShea and Imbler should be disregarded as dicta, \nor as strictly applying to violations of civil rights statutes passed under Congressโs \nauthority to enforce the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments. (Dkt. \n21 at 9; 45 at 11.) Duganโs argument also assumes that, because Congress did not \nexplicitly  abrogate  judicial  immunity  in  either  of  the  statutes  charged  in  the \nindictmentโas it did in 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 (concerning deprivation of civil rights) โ \nshe  is  immune  from  prosecution.  But  there  was  no  judicial  immunity  from \ncriminal prosecution in the first place, and thus, nothing to abrogate.  \nIn other words, Section 242, which arose in a very particular historical \ncontextโindeed, partly in response to judges violating civil rightsโshould not be \ntaken for the proposition that judges are immune from criminal prosecution in the \nabsence of a specific abrogation of immunity. Moreover, Sections 1505 and 1071 \nhave been on the books for many years, during which time (1) the Supreme Court \nhas never indicated that there is any judicial immunity for criminal conduct, and \n(2) prosecutions of judges have taken place under other generally applicable laws, \nincluding under bribery and public corruption statutes that contain no specific \nabrogation of judicial immunity. See, e.g., United States v. Hastings, 681 F.2d 706, \n11 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 11 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \n710 (11th Cir. 1982) (involving obstruction of justice under ยง 1503 and conspiracy \nunder ยง 371); see also Dkt. 28 at 9-11 (collecting cases). \nAs  the  magistrate  judge  correctly  recognized,  Duganโs  unprecedented \nargument that Congress must clearly abrogate judicial immunity assumes that: (1) \nโjudicial immunity from criminal prosecution is established in American law,โ \nwhich has only โweak evidenceโ; and (2) โยง 242 is an exception to that rule,โ which \nโoverlooks the specific historical context in which ยง 242 was passed.โ See Dkt. 43 \nat 15-16, 18-19. The magistrate judge also correctly declined to require Congress to \nโcomb through every federal criminal statute to indicate which statutes to apply \nto judges and which do not.โ (Dkt. 43 at 19.) \nThe magistrate also correctly rejected Duganโs related assertion that judicial \nimmunity permits the prosecution of only three โcategoriesโ of crimes against \njudges and that none apply to her. As Dugan would have it, judges may be \nprosecuted  for  โwholly  unofficial  actsโ  (first  category),  deprivation  of \nconstitutional rights under ยง 242 (second category), and actions related to their \njudicial duties if they engaged in self-serving activity like fraud (third category). Only \nthe  third  category  merited  discussion  under  the  facts  presented,  and  the \nmagistrate judge agreed with the government that there was no authority limiting \nso-called โjudicial actโ prosecutions to those involving crimes with a self-serving \nmotive. (Dkt. 43 at 20.) To quote the magistrate judge: โBut whether a judge seeks \n12 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 12 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nhis own self-gratification or self-enrichment is not the distinguishing feature for \nimmunity. What matters is whether the judge, even in performing her official \nduties, is accused of committing a crime.โ (Dkt. 43 at 20.) \nThe magistrate judge explained that Duganโs categories were inconsistent \nwith historical prosecutions of judges, including in cases like Wallace v. Powell, 2009 \nWL 4051974 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 20, 2009), and Claiborne, 727 F.2d 842, cases in which \nDugan concedes that judges were validly convicted for criminal acts. See Dkt. 43 \nat 20; Dkt 45 at 16-17. Dugan characterizes these cases as concerning unofficial acts, \nwhich (in her view) only tangentially implicated judicial acts. But there is no need \nto draw these amorphous lines in the first place, because no authority supports \nthat judicial-criminal immunity exists and that it depends on such permutations. \nDuganโs assumption of immunity wrongly inverts the analysis on a motion \nto dismiss charges that are properly pled in an indictment. Even in her view, \ncriminal  prosecutions  of  state  judges  are  undisputedly  permitted  in  certain \ncircumstances. However, this does not in any way imply the creation of categories \nwhere  prosecutions  are  forbidden  in  other  circumstances.  Dugan  is  simply \nattempting  to  explain  away  the  historical  prosecution  of  judges  in  a \ngerrymandered  way,  that  even  then  relies  on  amorphous  and  contestable \ndistinctions to carve her case out.  If it were in fact true that judges enjoy general \n13 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 13 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \njudicial immunity subject to certain defined exceptions, one would expect that \nsome court at some point would have said so. \nQuite simply, the Supreme Court has never retreated from its observation \nthat  judicial  immunity  does  not  apply  in  criminal  cases.  As  such,  whether \nsomething is a judicial act has never been the focus. Rather, the dividing line is \nwhether the conduct fits the elements of a criminal statute. The magistrate judgeโs \nrecommendation followed these principles.   \nAt a minimum, Duganโs objection would not provide a sound reason to \ndismiss  the  indictment  now.  Accepting  her  claim  about  the  nature  of  her \nprosecution would require fact-finding, which is untenable on a motion to dismiss, \na principle that the magistrate judge followed (Dkt. 43 at 3) (citing Yashar, 166 F.3d \nat 880) and to which Dugan has not objected.  \nDuganโs proposal also would create a situation in which the same conduct \nwould constitute a โjudicial actโ for civil immunity purposes but not a โjudicial \nactโ for criminal immunity purposes. For example, suppose a judge makes a \nfavorable  judicial  decision  in  return  for  compensation.  That  is  undeniably  a \njudicial act for which there would be civil but not criminal immunity. See, e.g., \nWallace, 2009 WL 4051974 at *6, *8-9 (holding that judicial decisions were โjudicial \nactsโ subject to civil judicial immunity, even if they were motivated by bribery; \nnoting the same judges were indicted for that behavior; and pointing out that \n14 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 14 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nโegregious behavior by judges is subject to prosecution under the criminal lawโ \nas a reason justifying absolute civil judicial immunity).  \nII.  Even if judicial immunity applies, it immunizes only โjudicial acts,โ and \nDugan is not being prosecuted for doing โher jobโ as a state-court judge. \n \nMoreover, even assuming such a fact-specific analysis were appropriate at \nthis  stage,  it  would  still  not  justify  dismissal.  As  the  government  previously \nexplained, because judicial immunity does not apply, this Court need not inquire \ninto whether the charged acts are โjudicialโ or โnon-judicialโ in character. (Dkt. 28 \nat 15-20.) The magistrate judge did essentially that, discussing โjudicialโ and \nโofficialโ acts only to emphasize their irrelevancy to the pivotal issue of whether \njudicial immunity from prosecution exists at all. It does not, so this Court should \nlikewise decline such an inquiry. However, even if a doctrine of immunity for \njudicial acts applied in a criminal case, it would not help Dugan. As alleged in the \nindictment, and discussed further below, Dugan went well beyond her official role \nwhen she endeavored to prevent federal law enforcement officers from executing \na valid arrest of E.F.R. in a public area of the Milwaukee County Courthouse. \nCentral to Duganโs arguments is the misconception that she is charged for \ncommitting โofficial acts in the course of her ordinary dutiesโ as a โstate judge,โ \nand she was doing โher jobโ and โnothing more.โ (Dkt. 15 at 5; 21 at 2; 45 at 1, 4.) \nThe government addressed this in its prior response, refuting Duganโs factual \n15 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 15 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nclaims that went beyond the four corners of the indictment, were contradicted by \nmaterials provided in discovery, and presented a view of the indictment least \nfavorable to the government. (Dkt. 28 at 5-7.) For example, Dugan asserted that \nagents โdisrupted active proceedings,โ โdisrupted [Duganโs] courtroom,โ and \nโdecided how they wanted [Dugan] to control [her] courtroom and the people in \nand near it.โ  (Dkt. 15 at 5; Dkt. 21 at 1, 17-18). Dugan continues to make these \nunsupported claims in her objections. (Dkt. 45 at 1, 24-25.) \nAs  the  government  indicated,  none  of  this  is  true,  and  nothing  in  the \nindictment or the anticipated evidence at trial supports it. (Dkt. 28 at 5-7.) Instead, \nall  events  arose  from  Duganโs  unilateral,  non-judicial,  and  unofficial  actions \noutside the role of a Wisconsin state judge by obstructing a federal immigration \nmatter over which she had no authority. (Dkt. 28 at 7.) The evidence will show that \nher actions included pausing an unrelated case, leaving her courtroom, disrupting \nproceedings in a colleagueโs courtroom, clearing agents out of the public hallway, \nquickly returning to her courtroom, directing E.F.R.โs attorney to โtake your client \nout and come back and get a dateโ and then to go through the jury door and โdown \nthe stairs,โ stating she would take โthe heatโ for her actions, and then  physically \nescorting  E.F.R.  and  his  attorney  into  a  non-public  hallway  with  access  to  a \nstairwell that led to a courthouse exit.  \n16 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 16 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nEndeavoring  to  obstruct  an  unrelated  proceeding  before  a  different \nsovereignโin a public space where federal agents had every right to enforce \nfederal lawโis not โa function normally performed by a [state court] judge.โ \nStump, 435 U.S. 349. As the Court observed in Ex parte Virginia, a judge does not \nengage in a judicial act when she acts โoutside of [her] authority and in direct \nviolation of the spiritโ of a criminal statute. 100 U.S. at 348. \nNow, in her objections, Dugan claims that the magistrate judge โagrees that \nevery act this indictment names is โpart of a judgeโs job.โโ See Dkt. 45 at 1, 4 \n(quoting Dkt. 43 at 30). Going even further, Dugan says that the allegations are \nโofficial acts and the magistrate judge does not contend otherwise.โ (Dkt. 45 at 4.) \nDugan misstates the magistrate judgeโs analysis, which refutes, rather than \nsupports, her official-acts argument. At the outset of evaluating Duganโs motion, \nthe  magistrate  judge  properly  relied  on  the  truth  of  the  allegations  in  the \nindictment  and  declined  to  resolve  any  โfactual  dispute  that  is  inextricably \nintertwined with [Duganโs] potential culpability.โ See Dkt. 43 at 2-3.  \nDuganโs objections nonetheless seize on a sentence much later in the report \nwhere the magistrate judge used the phrase โpart of a judgeโs jobโ in paraphrasing \nsome of the indictmentโs allegations. (Dkt. 43 at 30.) In doing so, the magistrate \njudge  was  addressingโand  rejectingโDuganโs  attempt  (i)  to  expand  judicial \nimmunity outside civil law and (ii) to distinguish other official-acts cases (like self-\n17 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 17 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nenrichment) that, according to Dugan, are within the three permissible categories \nof crimes that can be prosecuted against judges. See Dkt. 43 at 26-28. \nThus, the magistrate judge did not endorse Duganโs official-acts argument, \nfactually or legally. Rather, after tracing the history of judicial immunity in the \nUnited States, the judge asked and answered the question posed by Duganโs \nargument: โApplying the principles above, does judicial immunity shield Dugan \nfrom prosecution because the indictment alleges she violated federal criminal law \nwhile performing judicial duties? The answer is no.โ (Dkt. 43 at 27.) The magistrate \njudge continued, reasoning that: โThe indictment here, as in Joseph, alleges that \nDugan acted โcorruptly.โ And as the Joseph court found, to the extent immunity \nexists in the criminal context, it does not shield against corruption. In my view, \nthis is consistent with the cases where judges were prosecuted for performing \nofficial acts that were intertwined with bribery or extortionโeven where judges \nare acting in their official role, when the judicial acts violate criminal law, judicial \nimmunity does not bar prosecution.โ See id. at 29.  \nAlthough the magistrate judge allowed that some of the allegations describe \nconduct that could be considered โpart of a judgeโs job,โ see Dkt. 43 at 30, she \nultimately  attributed  no  weight  to  this  observation because โ[a]t  bottom,  the \nindictment  does  not  charge  Dugan  for  โopining  on  the  fly,โ  managing  her \ncourtroom, or allowing someone to appear by Zoom for future hearings.โ (Id. at \n18 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 18 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \n30.)  Instead,  the  judge  recounted  the  allegations  again,  concluding  that  the \nindictment does not rely on Duganโs unsupported interpretation of โofficial actsโ \nany more than the cases in which even Dugan agrees charges were properly \nbrought. See Dkt. 43 at 30.2  \nDugan is not immune from prosecution simply because she encountered \nfederal agents while working at the courthouse. She was not just doing โher jobโ \nwhen she added extraneous activities to her legitimate actions as a state judge to \ndefeat the enforcement of federal immigration law. As Dugan has acknowledged, \nshe โwas elected by the people of Milwaukee County to adjudicate their disputes and \nadminister the laws of Wisconsin.โ WIS. CONST. ART. VII, ยงยง 2, 7. (Dkt. 15 at 50 \n(emphasis added). Her actions to prevent arrest on a federal warrant, and to \nobstruct federal immigration proceedings, could not have been in furtherance of \nthat state judicial authority because Dugan has no judicial authority with respect \nto federal law. \nDugan  nonetheless  appears  to  equate  the  authority  of  the  federal \ngovernment to that of a โduly elected Wisconsin state judge.โ (Dkt. 45 at 26.) Both \n \n2Even in the civil context (where immunity applies), the Supreme Court has made clear \nthat whether actions were โpart of a judgeโs jobโ is not the standard. In Forrester, 484 U.S. \n219, for example, the Court distinguished โbetween judicial acts and the administrative, \nlegislative, or executive functions that judges may on occasion be assigned by law to \nperform.โ Id. at 228. Although the latter functions may be part of a judgeโs job, they are \nnot โjudicial actsโ which trigger immunity from civil liability. \n \n19 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 19 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nby law and Duganโs own reckoning, she cannot point to any basis empowering \nher to involve herself with federal agents who were enforcing federal law outside \nof Duganโs courtroom. On April 18, 2025, federal agents were not, despite Duganโs \nmischaracterization, acting in a manner that they โpreferred;โ they were doing \ntheir job, enforcing federal law, independent of and unrelated to Duganโs โjobโ \nand authority as a state judge. Agents took steps not to affect Duganโs docket. It \nwas Duganโs unilateral decision to step outside her authority and obstruct federal \nagents, not by โmusingโ about the federal arrest warrant they were executing (see \nDkt. 45 at 24), but by taking affirmative actions that went beyond her state judicial \nrole to prevent E.F.R.โs arrest on the warrant, in violation of federal law, all of \nwhich the magistrate judge correctly assumed to be true in deciding the motion. \nDugan  is  wrong  to  claim  that  her  actions  alleged  in  the  indictment, \nconstrued in the most favorable light to the government, were those of a โduly \nelected  Wisconsin  state  judgeโ  who  โwas  performing  the  duties  that  both \nWisconsin law and her chief judge assigned her [under] Wis. Stats. ยง ยง 753.03, \n757.01, [and] Wis. SCR 70.19(3)(a).โ (Dkt. 21 at 28-29; Dkt. 45 at 26.) Nothing in \nthose statutes or court rules, or any others not cited by Dugan, authorizes a \nWisconsin judge to intervene in the enforcement of federal immigration law. See \nArizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 399 (2012) (federal law preempts state-court \n20 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 20 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \njurisdiction over federal immigration law); see also Intโl Assโn of Machinists v. Allen, \n904 F.3d 490, 498 (7th Cir. 2018).3 \nDugan also argues that Magistrate Judge Joseph misunderstands Wallace, \n2009 WL 4051974, the โKids for Cashโ case, in which judges received kickbacks \nfrom detention facilities to place juveniles at their institutions. See Dkt. 45 at 17-19. \nShe argues that the โofficial actsโ in those cases were merely the means by which \nthe  judges  accomplished  their  โunofficial  graft.โ  That  description  actually \nundermines Duganโs argument. Like the judges in Wallace, Dugan may have used \nsome judicial โactsโ or tools (like wearing her robe when directing agents out of a \npublic hallway, falsely telling them they needed a judicial warrant, adjourning a \ncase off the record after initially telling the lawyer to get her client out and come \nback for a new date, and directing a litigant to use a non-public door to access a \nstairwell), but those judicial โactsโ or tools were simply the means by which she \nused to commit the crime of obstructing federal law enforcement officers. That \nDugan may have had a non-monetary motive, such as disagreement with federal \n \n3In her objection, Dugan asserts that the magistrate judge misread Ex parte Virginia, 100 \nU.S. 339. However, Duganโs own reading of that case cuts against her. According to \nDugan, the Supreme Court โheld that state law gave the judge no authority to exclude \nBlack jurors, which underscored the conclusion that his acts were not judicial at all.โ (Dkt. \n45 at 13) (emphasis supplied by Dugan). Applying Duganโs reading of Ex parte Virginia \nto the indictmentโs allegations against her, phrased as she does, would read: โWisconsin \nlaw gave Dugan no authority to obstruct agents executing a federal warrant, which \nunderscores the magistrate judgeโs conclusion that Duganโs acts were not judicial at all.โ  \n \n21 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 21 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nimmigration  policy,  does  not  mean  that  the  magistrate  judge  somehow \nโmisunderstoodโ Wallace. \nDugan also objects to the recommendation based on the supposed lack of a \nlimiting principle for judicial acts, saying that judges would be โvulnerable to \nprosecution  by  the  federal  executive  any  time  they  handle  a  trial  involving \ncontraband in evidenceโ like โchild pornography or a drug case,โ or โschedule a \nhearing  in  ways  that  inconvenienceโand  thus  arguably  impedeโfederal \nofficers.โ (Dkt. 45 at 1-2.) Duganโs argument proves too much. \nThe criminal law, indeed, the proper functioning of the entire criminal-\njustice  system,  both  on  the  state  and  federal  level,  requires  law-enforcement \nofficers  and  undercover  agents  to  handle  or  seize  contraband,  government \nanalysts to test it, prosecutors to introduce it in court, and court personnelโ\njudges, clerks, and jurorsโto possess it in their official duties. Under Duganโs \nframework, in which complete judicial immunity from criminal law is needed to \nprotect  judges  from  prosecution  in these every-day  scenarios, the  rest  of  the \noperatives in the criminal justice system, from jurors to government analysts to \nlaw enforcement officers to undercover agents, would be left subject to criminal \ncharges for attending to their duties. But that is not the way the criminal justice \nsystem operates. Recognizing the common-sense proposition that operatives in \nthe criminal justice system do not violate the criminal law on mere proof, without \n22 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 22 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nmore, that they are in good faith carrying out their required duties, does not \ntranslate into a need to recognize blanket judicial immunity for all acts done under \nthe guise of a judgeโs duties. \nAdditionally,  Dugan  overlooks  the  limiting  principle  that  the  crimes \ncharged in the indictment, like all crimes, have elements, defined by Congress and \nthe courts, not prosecutors, who must prove them beyond a reasonable doubt. The \nmagistrate  judge  recognized  this,  emphasizing  that  Dugan  is  charged  with \nknowingly concealing E.F.R. to prevent his discovery and arrest on a warrant, in \nviolation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1071 (Count One); and with corruptly endeavoring to \ninfluence,  obstruct,  and  impede  E.F.R.โs  arrest  on  a  warrant  by  committing \naffirmative acts to assist E.F.R. in evading such arrest, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \nยง 1505 (Count Two). (Dkt. 43 at 1-2, 30.) The indictment does not charge Dugan \nwith impeding federal agents by โinconveniencingโ them; there is no such crime. \nIII.  The Tenth Amendment does not preclude criminal prosecution of state \njudges who commit federal crimes.  \n \nThe  magistrate  judge  also  rejected  Duganโs  argument  that  the  Tenth \nAmendment bars  this prosecution. (Dkt. 43 at  31.) Dugan objects, saying  the \nrecommendation โmissed the importance of the Tenth Amendment here.โ (Dkt. \n45 at 22.) Dugan does not specify what the magistrate judge supposedly missed; \ninstead, she largely repeats her prior arguments. (Dkt. 45 at 22-27.) \n23 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 23 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nThe Tenth Amendment reads: โThe powers not delegated to the United \nStates by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the \nStates respectively, or to the people.โ U.S. Const. amend. X.  As the Seventh Circuit \nhas explained: \nThe  Tenth  Amendment  does  not  itself  demarcate  the  boundary \ndividing  state  from  federal  authority;  its  text  โis  essentially  a \ntautology,โ declaring only that the States retain those powers not \nsurrendered. Whether Congress has invaded the province reserved to \nthe States by the Tenth Amendment is therefore a question that must \nbe answered by inquiring whether Congress has exceeded the limits \nof authority bestowed upon it by Article I of the Constitution.  \n \nGillespie v. City of Indianapolis, 185 F.3d 693, 704 (7th Cir. 1999) (quoting and citing \nNew York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156-57 (1992)).  \nThere  is  no  errorโdirectly  or  by  omissionโin  the  magistrate  judgeโs \nanalysis. Duganโs argument was a wide-ranging discussion of federalism that \ntouched  upon,  among  other  things,  the  dormant  Commerce  Clause,  Second \nAmendment  rights,  general  police  power,  and  the  Indian Child  Welfare  Act. \nCritically,  however,  Dugan  did  not  cite  a  single  case  saying  that  the  Tenth \nAmendmentโthrough its โvertical separation of powersโ as Dugan framed itโ\nbars the prosecution of a state judge who commits a federal crime. That alone was \nenough to deny the motion. \nAs the magistrate judge observed, the โcrux of Duganโs argumentโ was that \nthe Tenth Amendment forbids the federal government from prosecuting Dugan \n24 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 24 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nfor  acts  โin  and  near  her  courtroomโ  because  that  would  unconstitutionally \nโsuperintend  the  administration  and  case-by-case  daily  functioning  of  state \ncourts[.]โ See Dkt. 43 at 31 (quoting Dkt. 21 at 26). The judge recommended denial \nbecause that was a โfact-ladenโ determination and โpresented questions for a jury \nthat cannot be resolved on a motion to dismiss.โ See id. at 32 (citing Joseph, 2020 \nWL 4288425 (rejecting similar arguments for dismissal)).  \nDuganโs objections do not explain why the Tenth Amendment โ to the \nextent it might have any application here โ would be so categorical as to require \ndismissal without any further factual development. Indeed, the magistrate judge \nadhered to the applicable standard on a motion to dismiss by construing the \nindictmentโs allegations as true and considering them in the light most favorable \nto the government. If anything, Duganโs objections seek to inject even more factual \ndisputes into the mix. See Dkt. 45 at 24 (asking additional questions about what \nthe federal government can โcommand a state governmentโ to do or not to do).  \nAs to the question of federal authority, the immigration enforcement that \nDugan attempted to obstruct was lawful โ in a public space โ and lay wholly \nwithin the jurisdiction of the federal government. See Arizona, 567 U.S. at 395-99 \n(federal  power  over  immigration  โ  including  removal  โ  is  undoubted  and \nexclusive).  The  sources  of  this  power  include  the  federal  governmentโs \nโconstitutional power to โestablish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,โ Art. I, ยง 8, cl. \n25 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 25 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \n4, and its inherent power as sovereign to control and conduct relations with \nforeign states,โ as well as the Supremacy Clause. Id. (citation omitted). \nAs noted above, Dugan talks about a โvertical separation of powers.โ But \nthe separation of powers โis an institutional doctrine rather than a personal one,โ \nand therefore conveys no โpersonal immunity from [federal] prosecution or trialโ \non a defendant like Dugan. United States v. Schock, 891 F.3d 334, 337 (7th Cir. 2018) \n(no personal immunity for a U.S. congressman); see also Hastings, 681 F.2d at 708-\n09 (no personal immunity for federal judge).   \nDuganโs argument also is difficult to square with the Supremacy Clause and \nthe federal governmentโs authority over immigration and foreign affairs. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Gillock, 445 U.S. 360, 370 (1980) (finding โno supportโ for extending \nspeech-or-debate immunity โto state legislators in federal criminal prosecutions,โ \nbecause โin those areas where the Constitution grants the Federal Government the \npower to act, the Supremacy Clause dictates that federal enactments will prevail \nover state exercises of powerโ); cf. id. (โ[F]ederal interference in the state legislative \nprocess is not on the same constitutional footing with the interference of one \nbranch of the Federal Government in the affairs of a coequal branch.โ). Indeed, the \nSupreme  Court  in  Gillock  expressly  rejected  the  argument  that  the  Tenth \nAmendment confers on state officials an evidentiary immunity against federal \nprosecution, holding that appeals to federalism โhave no special force with regard \n26 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 26 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nto state legislators,โ โstate executive officers and members of the state judiciary,โ even \nif a federal prosecution impinges upon โtraditional state governmental functions.โ \nId. at 371 (emphasis added).   \nIV.  Duganโs invocation of the constitutional avoidance canon is misplaced. \n  Dugan complains that the terms โcorruptlyโ and โproceedingโ are โwholly \nundefinedโ in Count Two of the indictment and faults Magistrate Judge Joseph for \nnot  wrestling  with  the  meaning  of  these  statutory  terms under  the  rubric of \nโconstitutional avoidance,โ i.e., as an alternative to addressing judicial immunity \nor federalism.   \n  The  magistrate  judge  correctly  described  Duganโs  invocation  of  the \nconstitutional avoidance canon as โmisplaced.โ See Dkt. 43 at 32.  โConstitutional \navoidanceโ is not a vague precept, but a carefully-delineated rule of statutory \nconstruction  that  โprovides  that  when  a  serious  doubt  is  raised  about  the \nconstitutionality of an act of Congress, [a court] will first ascertain whether a \nconstruction  of  the  statute  is  fairly  possible  by  which  the  question  may  be \navoided.โ Nielsen v. Preap, 586 U.S. 392, 418-419 (2019) (cleaned up). The canon \ncomes into play only when, โafter the application of ordinary textual analysis, [a] \nstatute is found to be susceptible of more than one construction.โ Id. โSpotting a \nconstitutional issue does not give a court the authority to rewrite a statute as it \npleases.  Instead,  the  canon  permits  a  court  to  โchoos[e]  between  competing \n27 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 27 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nplausible interpretations of a statutory text.โโ Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, \n298 (2018) (quoting Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 381 (2005)). \nDugan cites no case suggesting that a court may rely on the doctrine of \nconstitutional avoidance to bypass the restrictions on a motion to dismiss and \ndecide non-constitutional statutory interpretation questions that are not properly \nbefore it, such as the meaning of the terms โcorruptlyโ and โproceedingโ in Section \n1505. Moreover, Dugan does not posit competing, plausible constructions of those \nterms. Instead, she appears simply to import her own amorphous (and flawed) \nconception  of  judicial  immunity  into  the  application  of  the  relevant  statutes. \nNothing in the statutory text would allow for a plausible construction that includes \nsuch ad hoc carveouts. Dugan cannot dispute that if, for example, a bailiff (or a \nfellow defendant or any other nonjudicial actor) had done some of the things that \nshe did โ like ensuring that E.F.R. left the courtroom in a manner optimized to \navoid federal agents โ that individual could validly be prosecuted. It is therefore \ndifficult to see how her actions do not involve โcorruptlyโ obstructing a federal \nโproceeding.โ \n  Dugan cites but a single case in the โconstitutional avoidanceโ section of her \nobjections, and that case, Snyder v. United States, 603 U.S. 1 (2024), does nothing to \nfurther  her  argument.  Snyder  involved  the  distinction  between  bribes  and \ngratuities and the question of whether 18 U.S.C. ยง 666 criminalizes the latter in \n28 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 07/29/25     Page 28 of 30     Document 46\n\n \n \n \nsituations involving state and local officials. The Supreme Court in Snyder held \nthat it did not. That holding has no relevance to this case, and Snyder does not shed \nany light on the canon of constitutional avoidance, much less suggest that the \ncanon has application here.  The defendant has failed to show, by her citation to \nSnyder  or  otherwise,  that  the  magistrate  judge  erred  in  characterizing  her \nconstitutional avoidance argument as โmisplaced.โ Duganโs argument therefore \nshould be rejected. \nCONCLUSION \n  Duganโs  objections  largely  re-state  arguments  about  judicial  immunity, \nfederalism,  and  constitutional  avoidance  that  the  magistrate  judge  properly \nrejected  in  her  comprehensive  and  well-reasoned  report.

      "text": "Apr24,2025\ns/JDH\n25-M-397 (SCD)\nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 1 of 13     Document 1\n\nAFFIDAVIT IN SUPPORT OF CRIMINAL COMPLAINT \n \n  I, Lindsay Schloemer, being first duly sworn, hereby depose and state as follows: \nI.  Background and Experience. \n1.  I am a Special Agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (โFBIโ) and have been \nso employed since 2014.  I am currently assigned to the Milwaukee Field Office.  As such, I am \nan investigative or law enforcement agent of the United States authorized under Title 18, United \nStates Code, Section 3052, that is, an officer of the United States who is empowered by law to \nconduct investigations, to make arrests, and to collect evidence for various violations of federal \nlaw.  I am also a Certified Public Accountant (โCPAโ) and worked as a CPA for seven years before \nmy employment with the FBI. \n2.  I am currently assigned to a White-Collar Crimes Squad, which investigates public \ncorruption crimes, civil rights crimes, and financial crimes. During my tenure with the FBI, I have \nparticipated in investigations involving the corruption of public officials, to include facilitation \npayments and kickbacks. I have participated in all aspects of investigations including, among other \nthings, executing arrest warrants.  \n3.  I base this affidavit upon personal knowledge and upon information reported to me \nby other federal law enforcement officers during and as part of their official duties, all of whom I \nbelieve to be truthful and reliable. In this affidavit, โcase agentsโ refers to me and other FBI Special \nAgents who directly have participated with me in this investigation. I also base this affidavit upon \ninformation provided by citizen witnesses and other information as described below. \nII.  Purpose of Affidavit. \n4.  I make this affidavit in support of a criminal complaint charging HANNAH C. \nDUGAN (b. 1959): with (1) obstructing or impeding a proceeding before a department or agency \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 2 of 13     Document 1\n\nof the United States, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1505; and (2) concealing \nan individual to prevent his discovery and arrest, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, \nSection 1071. \n5.  This affidavit is intended to show merely that there is probable cause for the \nrequested criminal complaint and does not set forth my complete knowledge regarding this matter. \nIII.  Probable cause. \nA.  Background.  \n \n6.  I am aware from a review of public records that on March 18, 2025, Eduardo Flores-\nRuiz (โFlores-Ruizโ) (b. 1994) was charged in Milwaukee County Circuit Court Case Number \n2025CM000814 with three counts of Battery-Domestic Abuse-Infliction of Physical Pain or \nInjury.  \n7.  Agents  from  the  United  States  Department  of  Homeland  Security  (โDHSโ), \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement, Enforcement and Removal Operations (โICE EROโ) \nidentified Flores-Ruiz as an individual who was not lawfully in the United States.  A review of \nFlores-Ruizโs Alien Registration File (โA-Fileโ) indicated that Flores-Ruiz is a native and citizen \nof Mexico and that Flores-Ruiz had been issued an I-860 Notice and Order of Expedited Removal \nby United States Border Patrol Agents on January 16, 2013, and that Flores-Ruiz was thereafter \nremoved to Mexico through the Nogales, Arizona, Port of Entry. There is no evidence in the A-\nFile or DHS indices indicating that Flores-Ruiz sought or obtained permission to return to the \nUnited States.  \n8.  The  Milwaukee  ICE  ERO  Office  determined  through  biometric  fingerprint \ncomparison that the fingerprints of the individual charged in Milwaukee County Case Number \n2025CM000814 match those in the A-File for the Eduardo Flores-Ruiz removed from the United \n  2\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 3 of 13     Document 1\n\nStates as described above.  On or about April 17, 2025, an authorized immigration official found \nprobable cause to believe Flores-Ruiz was removable from the United States and issued a warrant \nfor his arrest.  The warrant provided, โYOU ARE COMMANDED to arrest and take into custody \nfor removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the above-named alien \n[Flores-Ruiz identified on warrant].โ Upon his arrest, Flores-Ruiz would be given a Notice of \nIntent/Decision to Reinstate Prior Order. He would then have an opportunity to contest the \ndetermination by making a written or oral statement to an immigration officer.   \n9.  The Milwaukee ICE ERO Office was aware that on April 18, 2025, Flores-Ruiz \nwas scheduled to attend a hearing in his criminal case. The hearing was set to take place in \nCourtroom 615, in front of Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge HANNAH C. DUGAN. Based \non the above information, on April 18, 2025, members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force \ntraveled to the Milwaukee County Courthouse, with Flores-Ruizโs arrest warrant in hand, for the \npurpose of executing the warrant.  \n10.  I am aware that law enforcement routinely executes warrants and makes arrests in \nthe public areas of buildings such as the Milwaukee County Courthouse. The reasons for this \ninclude not only the fact that law enforcement knows the location at which the wanted individual \nshould be located but also the fact that the wanted individual would have entered through a security \ncheckpoint and thus unarmed, minimizing the risk of injury to law enforcement, the public, and \nthe wanted individual. As such, members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force developed a plan \nto arrest Flores-Ruiz in a public area outside of Courtroom 615 following his scheduled criminal \ncourt appearance before Judge DUGAN.    \n11.  I  am  aware  that  two  prior  arrests  in  public  areas  of  the  Milwaukee  County \nCourthouse Complex of individuals who were not lawfully present in the United States had \n  3\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 4 of 13     Document 1\n\nreceived public attention. Both incidents involved individuals who had been charged with criminal \noffenses but who were not in custody and appearing for scheduled hearings in their criminal cases. \nI also am aware that pursuant to its policies, which had been made known to courthouse officials, \nthe  Milwaukee  ICE  ERO  Task  Force  was  focusing  its  resources  on  apprehending  charged \ndefendants making appearances in criminal cases โ and not arresting victims, witnesses, or \nindividuals appearing for matters in family or civil court. \nB.  Arrival of arrest teams at the Milwaukee County Courthouse and \nnotification of intended arrest. \n \n12.  Six members of the Milwaukee ICE ERO Task Force planned to take part in the \narrest of Flores-Ruiz on April 18, 2025. This included ICE ERO Deportation Officer A, Customs \nand  Border  Protection  Officer  A,  FBI  Special  Agents  A  and  B,  and  Drug  Enforcement \nAdministration (โDEAโ) Special Agents A and B. The agents were generally dressed in plain \nclothes and intended to effectuate the arrest in as low-key and safe of a manner as possible.  \n13.  At approximately 8:00 am on April 18, 2025, Deportation Officer A and CBP \nOfficer A arrived at the Milwaukee County Courthouse, presented identification to a security \nguard, and explained that they were present to make an arrest. Deportation Officer A and CBP \nOfficer A were asked to show not only their credentials but also their badges. The security guard \nstated that she needed to speak with a supervisor. A shift sergeant with Milwaukee County \nSheriffโs Office was contacted and spoke to Deportation Officer A. They discussed the details of \nthe planned arrest, including in which courtroom Flores-Ruiz was set to appear. The sergeant asked \nthat any arrest wait until after the completion of the scheduled hearing before Judge DUGAN. As \nthis was standard practice, Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A agreed, and they were \nallowed to proceed unescorted to the public hallway outside of Courtroom 615. \n  4\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 5 of 13     Document 1\n\n14.  The other members of the arrest team were already present in the sixth floor public \nhallway when Deportation Officer A and CBP Officer A arrived. Before Deportation Officer A \nand CBP Officer A arrived outside of Courtroom 615, FBI agents A and B had advised the \ncourtroom deputy for Courtroom 615 that law enforcement was there to arrest Flores-Ruiz. FBI \nAgent A displayed his credentials to the courtroom deputy and informed him that they were there \nto assist ICE in arresting Flores-Ruiz. They agreed that the arrest would take place after Flores-\nRuizโs court appearance. The agents then left the courtroom and took positions at different \nlocations in the public hallway.  \n15.  Case agents have interviewed the courtroom deputy present in Courtroom 615 on \nApril 18, 2025, who corroborated the above information. The courtroom deputy had opened the \ndoors to the courtroom at approximately 8:15 am and reported that individuals began checking in \nfor the list of matters scheduled for that morning. The courtroom deputy had received a list of \nindividuals appearing that day, and the courtroom deputy checked in defendants while attorneys \nchecked in with the clerk.  \n16.  The courtroom deputy explained that at approximately 8:15 am, FBI agents advised \nthat they were working with ICE and were planning to arrest Flores-Ruiz. The courtroom deputy \nasked that the agents wait outside and arrest Flores-Ruiz after the hearing. The agents agreed and \nleft the courtroom.  \n17.  The courtroom deputy told case agents that after an ICE arrest in the courthouse \nearlier that month, a shift sergeant had asked bailiffs to alert a supervisor at the Milwaukee County \nSheriffโs Office if ICE agents were in the building. Accordingly, the courtroom deputy notified a \nshift sergeant.   \n  5\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 6 of 13     Document 1\n\n18.  Arrest team members reported that while waiting outside of the courtroom, a \nwoman  approached  and  took  photos  of  arrest  team  members.  DEA  Agent  B,  who  was \ninconspicuously seated away from the group, was not photographed. The individual taking \nphotographs of the agents has been identified by multiple witnesses as an attorney employed by \nthe State of Wisconsin Public Defenders Office (โAttorney Aโ). \n19.  Team members observed Flores-Ruiz arrive on the 6th floor of the courthouse at \napproximately 8:43 a.m. He was greeted by his attorney, and the two entered Courtroom 615 \ntogether. \nC.  Judge DUGAN learns of ICEโs presence and confronts members of the arrest \nteam. \n \n20.  Witnesses  have  described  Judge  DUGANโs  response  to  learning  of  ICEโs \npresence. For example, the courtroom deputy indicated that when Flores-Ruiz arrived, Judge \nDUGAN already was on the bench and conducting proceedings (unrelated to the Flores-Ruiz \nmatter). The courtroom deputy observed Attorney A (the individual who had photographed the \nagents) enter and approach Judge DUGANโs clerk. Attorney A stated that there appeared to be \nICE agents in the hallway. Attorney A told the clerk where the agents were seated and what they \nwere wearing.  \n21.  The courtroom deputy reported that the clerk then got up and talked with Judge \nDUGAN. Judge DUGAN became visibly angry, commented that the situation was โabsurd,โ left \nthe bench, and entered chambers. At the time, Flores-Ruiz was seated in the gallery of the \ncourtroom.  \n22.  Another individual, Attorney B, was working as an Assistant District Attorney in \nJudge  DUGANโs  courtroom  on  April  18,  2025.  According  to  Attorney  B,  there  were \n  6\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 7 of 13     Document 1\n\napproximately eight criminal cases, including Flores-Ruizโs case, scheduled for pretrial hearings \nthat morning. Attorney B was aware that the victims from Flores-Ruizโs criminal case were in \ncourt. While Attorney B was busy preparing for that morningโs docket, Attorney B heard someone \nannounce, โICE is here.โ Shortly thereafter, Attorney B heard Judge DUGAN say that she was \ngoing to call the Chief Judge before leaving the courtroom.   \n23.  Members of the arrest team reported the following events after Judge DUGAN \nlearned of their presence and left the bench. Judge DUGAN and Judge A, who were both wearing \njudicial robes, approached members of the arrest team in the public hallway. Judge Aโs courtroom \nis located adjacent to Judge DUGANโs courtroom. Witnesses uniformly reported that Judge \nDUGAN was visibly upset and had a confrontational, angry demeanor. Judge DUGAN addressed \nDeportation Officer A and asked if Deportation Officer A was present for a court appearance. \nWhen Deportation Officer A responded, โno,โ Judge DUGAN stated that Deportation Officer A \nwould need to leave the courthouse. Deportation Officer A stated that Deportation Officer A was \nthere to effectuate an arrest.  Judge DUGAN asked if Deportation Officer A had a judicial warrant, \nand Deportation Officer A responded, โNo, I have an administrative warrant.โ Judge DUGAN \nstated that Deportation Officer A needed a judicial warrant. Deportation Officer A told Judge \nDUGAN that Deportation Officer A was in a public space and had a valid immigration warrant. \nJudge DUGAN asked to see the administrative warrant and Deportation Officer A offered to show \nit to her.  Judge DUGAN then demanded that Deportation Officer A speak with the Chief Judge. \nJudge DUGAN then had a similar interaction with FBI Agent B and CBP Officer A.  After finding \nout that they were not present for a court appearance and that they were with ICE, Judge DUGAN \nordered them to report to the Chief Judgeโs office. \n  7\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 8 of 13     Document 1\n\n24.  Judge A then escorted members of the arrest team away from Courtroom 615, down \nthe hall, and through a set of double doors towards the reception area for the Chief Judgeโs office. \nDEA Agent B, who was not recognized by Judge DUGAN and Judge A as being part of the arrest \nteam, remained behind outside of Courtroom 615.  \n25.  The courtroom deputy reported observing a portion of the above-described events \nin the hallway. According to the courtroom deputy, shortly after Judge DUGAN was advised of \nICEโs presence, the courtroom deputy left the courtroom to look for an unrelated defendant (whom \nthe courtroom deputy was seeking to arrest for an open warrant). The courtroom deputy saw Judge \nDUGAN in her robe in the public hallway telling one of the federal agents that he needed to go \ntalk to the Chief Judge. Judge DUGAN appeared visibly angry and was walking quickly. As soon \nas the agent entered the Chief Judgeโs vestibule area, the courtroom deputy saw Judge DUGAN \nwalk south down the hallway and enter a locked door near Courtroom 615. I am familiar with the \nfloor plan for the sixth floor of the courthouse and believe the door Judge DUGAN entered led to \na non-public hallway from which she could access her courtroom and chambers. \n26.  DEA Agent B, who had remained in the hallway and had not been recognized as a \nmember of the arrest team, reported that Judge DUGAN walked around the hallway and appeared \nto be looking for additional agents before she returned to her courtroom.  \n27.  Once inside the office of the Chief Judge, Deportation Officer A showed Judge A \nhis credentials and the administrative warrant. Judge A asked the Chief Judgeโs clerk to make a \ncopy of the warrant and asked whether the Chief Judge was available. The clerk advised that the \nChief Judge was not in the building but later advised that he was on the phone. At that point, Judge \nA left, and Deportation Officer A went inside a more private area of the Chief Judgeโs office to \nspeak with him on the phone. During their conversation, the Chief Judge stated he was working \n  8\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 9 of 13     Document 1\n\non a policy which would dictate locations within the courthouse where ICE could safely conduct \nenforcement actions. The Chief Judge emphasized that such actions should not take place in \ncourtrooms or other private locations within the building. Deportation Officer A asked about \nwhether enforcement actions could take place in the hallway. The Chief Judge indicated that \nhallways are public areas. When the Chief Judge expressed interest in talking to ICE ERO \nmanagement about this policy, Deportation Officer A provided him with contact information for \nICE EROโs Assistant Field Office Director. \n28.  While Deportation Officer A was speaking with the Chief Judge, DEA Agent A, \nCBP Officer A, and FBI Agents A and B waited in the vestibule area outside the Chief Judgeโs \nOffice. DEA Agent A departed the area after a short while.  Judge DUGANโs courtroom deputy \nthen approached the remaining arrest team members and stated that the courtroom deputy was not \nthe one who had notified Judge DUGAN about their arrest plans. The courtroom deputy also made \na comment about Judge DUGAN โpushingโ Flores-Ruizโs case through, which the arrest team \ninterpreted to mean that Judge DUGAN was attempting to expedite Flores-Ruizโs hearing.   \nD.   Judge DUGAN escorts Flores-Ruiz through a โjury doorโ to avoid his arrest.  \n \n29.  Multiple witnesses have described their observations after Judge DUGAN returned \nto her courtroom after directing members of the arrest team to the Chief Judgeโs office. For \nexample, the courtroom deputy recalled that upon the courtroom deputyโs return to the courtroom, \ndefense counsel for Flores-Ruiz was talking to the clerk, and Flores-Ruiz was seated in the jury \nbox, rather than in the gallery. The courtroom deputy believed that counsel and the clerk were \nhaving an off-the-record conversation to pick the next court date. Defense counsel and Flores-Ruiz \nthen walked toward each other and toward the public courtroom exit. The courtroom deputy then \nsaw Judge DUGAN get up and heard Judge DUGAN say something like โWait, come with me.โ \n  9\n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 10 of 13     Document 1\n\nDespite having been advised of the administrative warrant for the arrest of Flores-Ruiz, Judge \nDUGAN then escorted Flores-Ruiz and his counsel out of the courtroom through the โjury door,โ \nwhich leads to a nonpublic area of the courthouse. These events were also unusual for two reasons. \nFirst, the courtroom deputy had previously heard Judge DUGAN direct people not to sit in the jury \nbox because it was exclusively for the juryโs use.  Second, according to the courtroom deputy, only \ndeputies, juries, court staff, and in-custody defendants being escorted by deputies used the back \njury door. Defense attorneys and defendants who were not in custody never used the jury door.   \n30.  Attorney  B  similarly  explained  that  after  returning  to  the  courtroom,  Judge \nDUGAN forcefully motioned for Flores-Ruizโs attorney and a male she did not know (Attorney B \nhad never met Flores-Ruiz) to approach. Flores-Ruizโs attorney appeared to be confused by the \njudgeโs gesture but complied with her directive.  Judge DUGAN commanded Flores-Ruizโs \nattorney and the male to leave through a backdoor of the courtroom. Attorney B then saw Judge \nDUGAN  escort  Flores-Ruizโs  attorney  and  the  male  through  a  non-public  door  near  the \ncourtroomโs jury box. Shortly thereafter, Judge DUGAN  came back to the courtroom and \nconducted hearings on that morningโs docket. Later that morning, Attorney B realized that Flores-\nRuizโs case had never been called and asked the court about it. Attorney B learned that Flores-\nRuizโs case had been adjourned. This happened without Attorney Bโs knowledge or participation, \neven though Attorney B was present in court to handle Flores-Ruizโs case on behalf of the state, \nand even though victims were present in the courtroom. \n31.  A Victim Witness Specialist (VWS) employed by the Milwaukee County District \nAttorneyโs Office was present in Courtroom 615 on April 18, 2025. The VWS made contact with \nthe victims in Flores-Ruizโs criminal case, who were also in court. The VWS was able to identify \nFlores-Ruiz based upon the victimsโ reactions to his presence in court. The VWS observed Judge \n  10 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 11 of 13     Document 1\n\nDUGAN gesture towards Flores-Ruiz and an unknown Hispanic woman.  The VWS stated she \nbelieved the Hispanic woman may have been an interpreter.  However, based on the VWSโs \ndescription of the woman and other witness statements, I believe the Hispanic woman to which \nthe VWS referred was Flores-Ruizโs attorney.  The VWS stated that Judge DUGAN then exited \nthrough the jury door with Flores-Ruiz and the Hispanic woman. The VWS was concerned because \nFlores-Ruizโs case had not yet been called, and the victims were waiting.   \n32.  Another attorney (โAttorney Cโ), who was in Courtroom 615 on April 18, 2025, to \nrepresent a client, also advised case agents that he observed Judge DUGAN forcefully direct two \nindividuals, a man and a woman, to leave through the jury door. Attorney C indicated that this was \ndone with a โsternโ tone.  \nE.  Ruiz makes it out of the courthouse and is arrested after a foot chase. \n \n33.  After leaving the Chief Judgeโs vestibule and returning to the public hallway, DEA \nAgent A reported that Flores-Ruiz and his attorney were in the public hallway. DEA Agent B also \nobserved Flores-Ruiz and his attorney in the hallway near Courtroom 615 and noted that Flores-\nRuiz was looking around the hallway. From different vantage points, both agents observed Flores-\nRuiz and his counsel walk briskly towards the elevator bank on the south end of the sixth floor.  I \nam familiar with the layout of the sixth floor of the courthouse and know that the south elevators \nare not the closest elevators to Courtroom 615, and therefore it appears that Flores-Ruiz and his \ncounsel elected not to use the closest elevator bank to Courtroom 615.  DEA Agent A followed \nFlores-Ruiz and his attorney towards the south elevator bank. At approximately 8:50 a.m., DEA \nAgent A alerted other members of the arrest team that DEA Agent A was on the elevator with \nFlores-Ruiz. While on the elevator, Flores-Ruiz and his attorney spoke to each other in Spanish, \n  11 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA     Filed 04/24/25     Page 12 of 13     Document 1\n\nwhich DEA Agent A did not understand. They exited the elevator on one of the bottom floors of \nthe courthouse and used the Ninth Street public entrance/exit to leave the building.  \n34.  Having received the above-referenced information from DEA Agent A, other \nmembers of the arrest team scrambled to locate Flores-Ruiz and arrest him. DEA Agent B and FBI \nAgents A and B took another elevator down to one of the bottom floors of the courthouse and \nquickly exited the building onto 9th Street. After DEA Agent A notified the team that Flores-Ruiz \nwas in the front of the courthouse near the flagpole, the agents ran towards the front of the \ncourthouse. FBI Agent B and DEA Agent A approached Flores-Ruiz and identified themselves as \nlaw enforcement. Flores-Ruiz turned around and sprinted down the street. A foot chase ensued. \nThe agents pursued Flores-Ruiz for the entire length of the courthouse and ultimately apprehended \nhim near the intersection of W. State Street and 10th Street. Flores-Ruiz was handcuffed and \ndetained. Around 9:05 a.m., or approximately 22 minutes after the arrest team first spotted Flores-\nRuiz on the sixth floor of the courthouse, FBI Agent A communicated to the surveillance team that \nFlores-Ruiz had been arrested.

      "text": " UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nEASTERN DISTRICT OF WISCONSIN \n \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, \n \n           Plaintiff,             \n \n           v.              Case No. 25-CR-89  \n \nHANNAH C. DUGAN, \n \n  Defendant. \n \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION  \nON DEFENDANTโS MOTION TO DISMISS  \n \n \nOn May 13, 2025, a grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Wisconsin returned a \ntwo-count indictment against Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah C. Dugan. \n(Docket # 6.) Dugan is charged in Count One with knowingly concealing a person for whose \narrest a warrant and process had been issued, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1071. She is charged \nin Count Two with obstruction of the United States Department of Homeland Securityโs \nremoval proceedings, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505. Dugan was arraigned on the charges \nand entered a plea of not guilty. (Docket # 17.) A jury trial before the Honorable Judge Lynn \nAdelman will be scheduled after resolution of pretrial motions.    \nDugan moves to dismiss the indictment under Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b) on the grounds \nthat  she,  as  a  judge,  is  immune  from  criminal  prosecution  for  judicial  acts,  that  her \nprosecution violates the limits of federal power under the Tenth Amendment, and that the \nindictment could be dismissed under the canon of constitutional avoidance. (Docket # 21.) \nAdditionally, two parties seek leave to file amicus curiae briefs. (Docket # 25; Docket # 32.) \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 1 of 37     Document 43\n\nThe government opposes Duganโs motion (Docket # 28) and objects to the filing of both \namicus briefs (Docket # 29; Docket # 39). \nFor the reasons explained below, I recommend that Duganโs motion to dismiss be \ndenied. Further, the partiesโ requests for leave to file amicus briefs are granted. \nBACKGROUND \nThe indictment charges as follows: \nCount One \nOn or about April 18, 2025, Dugan knowingly concealed E.F.R., a person for whose \narrest a warrant and process had been issued under the provisions of the law of the United \nStates, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of E.F.R., after notice and knowledge of the \nfact that a warrant and process had been issued for the apprehension of E.F.R., in violation \nof 18 U.S.C. ยง 1071; \nCount Two \nOn or about April 18, 2025, Dugan did corruptly endeavor to influence, obstruct, and \nimpede the due and proper administration of the law under which a pending proceeding was \nbeing had before a department and agency of the United States, namely the administrative \narrest  of  E.F.R.  for  purposes  of  removal  proceedings  conducted  by  the  United  States \nDepartment of Homeland Security, by committing affirmative acts to assist E.F.R. to evade \narrest, including: \n \na)  confronting  members  of  a  United  States  Immigration  and  Customs \nEnforcement (ICE) Task Force and falsely telling them they needed a judicial \nwarrant to effectuate the arrest of E.F.R.; \n \nb)  upon learning that they had an administrative warrant for E.F.R.โs arrest, \ndirecting all identified members of the ICE Task Force to leave the location of \n2 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 2 of 37     Document 43\n\nthe  planned  arrest  (a  public  hallway  outside  of  Courtroom  615  of  the \nMilwaukee County Courthouse) and go to the Chief Judgeโs office; \n \nc)  addressing E.F.R.โs Milwaukee County Circuit Court criminal case off the \nrecord while ICE Task Force members were in the Chief Judgeโs office; \n \nd)  directing E.F.R. and his counsel to exit Courtroom 615 through a non-public \njury door; and \n \ne)  advising E.F.R.โs counsel that E.F.R. could appear by โZoomโ for his next \ncourt date. \n \nIn violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505. (Docket # 6.)  \nLEGAL STANDARD \n  Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b)(1) provides that a party may raise by pretrial motion any \ndefense, objection, or request that the court can determine without a trial on the merits. When \ndeciding a motion to dismiss a criminal indictment, the court assumes that the indictmentโs \nfactual allegations are true and must โview all facts in the light most favorable to the \ngovernment.โ United States v. Calhoun, 710 F. Supp. 3d 575, 579 (N.D. Ill. 2024) (citing United \nStates v. Yashar, 166 F.3d 873, 880 (7th Cir. 1999)). The Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \nhowever, โdo not provide a mechanism analogous to the motion for summary judgment in \nthe Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.โ United States v. Abramson, No. 18 CR 681, 2023 WL \n349842, at *3 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 20, 2023). Thus, if the โdefense raises a factual dispute that is \ninextricably intertwined with a defendantโs potential culpability, a judge cannot resolve that \ndispute on a Rule 12(b) motion.โ Id. (citing United States v. Sampson, 898 F.3d 270, 281 (2d \nCir. 2018)).  \nANALYSIS \n  Dugan moves to dismiss the indictment on three grounds. First, she argues that as a \nstate court judge acting within the scope of her official duties, prosecution is barred by judicial \n3 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 3 of 37     Document 43\n\nimmunity. Second, Dugan argues that under the allocation of power retained by the states \nunder the Tenth Amendment, this federal prosecution violates the Constitutionโs separation \nof powers. And third, she argues the indictment should be dismissed under the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance.  \n1.  Judicial Immunity \nBecause the parties differ in their views on the applicable law, it is instructive to begin \nwith a survey of the law on judicial immunity before turning to Duganโs arguments and to \nthe application of the law to this case. \n1.1  The History of Judicial Immunity in Civil Lawsuits  \nJudicial immunity is a long-recognized concept dating back over 400 years to English \ncommon law, insulating the judiciary from civil liability. See Jeffrey M. Shaman, Judicial \nImmunity from Civil and Criminal Liability, 27 San Diego L. Rev. 1, 3 (1990) (citing Floyd v. \nBarker, 77 Eng. Rep. 1305 (Star Chamber 1607)). Prior to the creation of the right to appeal, \na losing litigant would seek nullification of a false judgment and a fine against the judge who \nrendered it. Id. However, once an appeals system was put into place, giving a dissatisfied \nlitigant an avenue for redress, the concept of judicial immunity arose and was gradually \naccepted under the common law. Id. \n    1.1.1  The Early Years \n  The seminal case, Floyd v. Barker, decided by Lord Coke in 1607, addressed the \nquestion of whether a judge presiding over a murder trial could be prosecuted in another court \nfor criminal conspiracy. See Note, Judicial Immunity at the (Second) Founding: A New Perspective \non ยง 1983, 136 Harv. L. Rev. 1456, 1464 (2023). Lord Coke concluded that judges were \nimmune from such prosecutions, stating: โa Judge, for any thing done by him as Judge, by \n4 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 4 of 37     Document 43\n\nthe authority which the King hath committed to him, and as sitting in the seat of the King \n(concerning his justice) shall not be drawn in question before any other Judge . . . .โ 77 Eng. \nRep. at 1307. In other words, Lord Coke pronounced a rule of absolute immunity for all \njudicial acts. \nFloyd is also important for articulating for the first time what are now considered some \nof the modern policies that underlie the doctrine of judicial immunity. Shaman, 27 San Diego \nL. Rev. at 3. Judicial immunity serves the following purposes according to Lord Coke: (1) it \nensures the finality of judgments; (2) it protects judicial independence; (3) it avoids continual \nattacks upon judges who may be sincere in their conduct; and (4) it protects the system of \njustice from falling into disrepute. Id. \nThe first major application of judicial immunity by the United States Supreme Court \noccurred in Randall v. Brigham, 74 U.S. 523 (1868). In Randall, an attorney was accused of \nobtaining  an  agreement  from  a  client  that  was  โunconscionable  and  extortionate,  and \ntherefore grossly unprofessionalโ and was removed from his office as an attorney-at-law. Id. \nat 525โ26. In response, the attorney sued the presiding judge for unlawful removal. Id. The \nCourt, citing Floyd, stated that โit is a general principle applicable to all judicial officers, that \nthey are not liable to a civil action for any judicial act done within their jurisdiction.โ Id. at \n535. The Court left open a possible exception to this absolute immunity, however, โwhere the \nacts, in excess of jurisdiction, are done maliciously or corruptly.โ Id. at 536.  \nThree years later in Bradley v. Fisher, 80 U.S. 335 (1871), the Court made clear that civil \njudicial immunity applies even for malicious or corrupt acts. In Bradley, Attorney Joseph \nBradley was a member of the bar of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and Judge \nGeorge Fisher was one of the justices of that court. Id. at 344. While representing a party \n5 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 5 of 37     Document 43\n\nduring a trial before Judge Fisher, Attorney Bradley allegedly โaccostedโ the judge in a โrude \nand insulting manner.โ Id. After Judge Fisher effectively disbarred Bradley for his behavior, \nBradley sued Judge Fisher for monetary damages. Id. at 344โ45.  \nInvoking Floyd, the Court noted that the โprinciple . . . which exempts judges of courts \nof superior or general authority from liability in a civil action for acts done by them in the \nexercise of their judicial functions . . . has been the settled doctrine of the English courts for \nmany centuries . . . and has never been denied . . . in the courts of this country.โ Id. at 347. \nThe Court further stated the exemption of judges from civil liability cannot be affected by the \nmotives with which their judicial acts were performedโโThe purity of their motives cannot \nin this way be the subject of judicial inquiry.โ Id. Thus, even though Bradley accused Judge \nFisher of โโwantonly, corruptly, arbitrarily, and oppressively intending to remove [Bradley] \nfrom his office as an attorney-at-law,โ id. at 338, the Court concluded that judges were not \nliable in civil actions for their judicial acts, even when such acts were taken in excess of their \njurisdiction, id. at 351.  \n    1.1.2  The Modern Era \n  In Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547 (1967), the Court granted certiorari to consider whether \na  local  judge  was  liable  for  damages  under  42  U.S.C.  ยง  1983  for  an  unconstitutional \nconviction. Id. at 551. Section 1983 allows individuals to civilly sue State actors for depriving \nthem of their rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution. 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983. \nThe plaintiffs were members of a group of white and African-American Episcopal clergymen \nwho attempted to use segregated facilities at an interstate bus terminal. 386 U.S. at 549. They \nsued local police officers and a municipal police justice for false imprisonment after they were \n6 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 6 of 37     Document 43\n\nconvicted of disturbing the peace. Id. The plaintiffs alleged that the judgeโs findings of guilt \nand sentences were based upon racial discrimination. Id. at 551. \n  The Pierson Court had โno difficultyโ finding that the judge was immune from liability \nfor damages for his role in the convictions as โ[f]ew doctrines were more solidly established \nat common law than the immunity of judges from liability for damages for acts committed \nwithin their judicial jurisdiction,โ citing Bradley in support. Id. at 553โ54. The Court stated \nthat immunity โapplies even when the judge is accused of acting maliciously and corruptly, \nand it is not for the protection or benefit of a malicious or corrupt judge, but for the benefit of \nthe public, whose interest it is that the judges should be at liberty to exercise their functions \nwith independence and without fear of consequences.โ Id. at 554 (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted).  \nShortly over a decade later, the Supreme Court again addressed judicial immunity in \nStump v. Sparkman, 435 U.S. 349 (1978). In Stump, the mother of a fifteen-year-old girl \npresented a document entitled โPetition To Have Tubal Ligation Performed On Minor and \nIndemnity Agreementโ to Judge Harold Stump for signature. Id. at 351. Judge Stump \napproved the petition, despite the fact that the petition โwas not given a docket number, was \nnot placed on file with the clerkโs office, and was approved in an ex parte proceeding without \nnotice to the minor, without a hearing, and without the appointment of a guardian ad litem.โ \nId. at 360. The minor was sterilized without her knowledge under the pretext of having an \nappendectomy. Id. at 353. After learning the true nature of the surgery years later, the \ndaughter sued multiple parties, including her mother and Judge Stump, for violation of her \nconstitutional rights. Id. at 352.  \n7 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 7 of 37     Document 43\n\n The Court concluded Judge Stump was immune from civil liability. The Court \nreiterated that the โnecessary inquiryโ in determining immunity is โwhether at the time [the \njudge] took the challenged action he had jurisdiction over the subject matter before him,โ as \na judge โwill not be deprived of immunity because the action he took was in error, was done \nmaliciously, or was in excess of his authority; rather, he will be subject to liability only when \nhe has acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.โ Id. at 356โ57 (internal quotation and \ncitation omitted). The Court found that because the court over which Judge Stump presided \nwas one of general jurisdiction, neither the procedural errors he may have committed nor the \nlack of a specific statute authorizing his approval of the petition in question made him liable. \nId. at 359โ60. Nor did the informality of the proceedings render Judge Stumpโs actions non-\njudicial. Id. at 361. Rather, the factors determining whether a judgeโs act is โjudicialโ relate \nto the nature of the act itself and the expectations of the partiesโโwhether it is a function \nnormally performed by a judgeโ and โwhether [the parties] dealt with the judge in his judicial \ncapacity.โ Id. at 362. And in this case, the Court concluded that because Judge Stump \nperformed the type of act normally performed only by judges and did so in his capacity as a \ncircuit court judge; he was immune from civil liability, despite the โunfairness to litigants that \nsometimes results.โ Id. at 363.  \nTwo years later, in Dennis v. Sparks, 449 U.S. 24 (1980), the Court was again faced with \nthe question of judicial immunity for damages under ยง 1983. In Dennis, a state court judge \nenjoined the production of minerals from certain oil leases owned by the plaintiffs. Id. at 25. \nThe appellate court subsequently dissolved the injunction as having been illegally issued. Id. \nThe plaintiffs sued the judge for monetary damages under ยง 1983, alleging that the injunction \nhad been corruptly issued as the result of a conspiracy between the judge and other defendants \n8 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 8 of 37     Document 43\n\nto deprive plaintiffs of their property, i.e., two years of oil production, without due process of \nlaw. Id. at 25โ26. The court of appeals upheld the district courtโs finding that the judge was \nimmune from liability under ยง 1983, whether or not the injunction was issued as the result of \na corrupt conspiracy. Id. at 26. The Supreme Court affirmed, stating again that the Court has \nconsistently adhered to the rule that judges defending against ยง 1983 actions enjoy absolute \nimmunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial capacities. Id. at 27. \nHowever, while the judge was immune from suit, the Court concluded that the conspiring \nparties could still be held liable under ยง 1983. Id. at 28.  \nThe judgeโs co-conspirators argued that if the case went to trial, โthe charge of \nconspiracy and judicial corruption will necessarily be aired and decided, the consequence \nbeing that the judge, though not a party and immune from liability, will be heavily involved, \nvery likely as a witness forced to testify about and defend his judicial conduct.โ Id. at 30. The \nCourt concluded, however, that there was no constitutionally based privilege immunizing \njudges from being required to testify about their judicial conduct in third-party litigation. Id. \nโNor has any demonstration been made that historically the doctrine of judicial immunity \nnot only protected the judge from liability but also excused him from responding as a witness \nwhen his co-conspirators are sued.โ Id. The Court concluded that judicial immunity was not \nโdesigned to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability,โ such as the \nnormal obligation to respond as a witness when he has information material to a criminal or \ncivil proceeding. Id. at 31 (citing United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 705โ707 (1974)). It \nexplained  that  the  concerns  underpinning  the  concept  of  judicial  immunity,  a  judgeโs \nindependence and judicial performance, are not similarly found when a judge is required to \ntestify against co-conspirators, noting that โa proceeding in which he cannot be held liable for \n9 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 9 of 37     Document 43\n\ndamages and which he need not defend, is not of the same order of magnitude as the prospects \nof being a defendant in a damages action from complaint to verdict.โ Id.  \n  In Forrester v. White, 484 U.S. 219 (1988), the Court again was tasked with determining \nwhat constitutes a judicial act for immunity purposes. Under Illinois law, a circuit court judge \nhas the authority to hire adult probation officers, who were removable at his discretion. Id. at \n221. Judge White hired Cynthia Forrester as an adult and juvenile probation officer. Id. Judge \nWhite subsequently demoted Forrester and then terminated her employment, which Forrester \nalleged was an act of discrimination based on her sex in violation of the Equal Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. 221โ22. After a jury granted an award in Forresterโs \nfavor, Judge White moved for a new trial, which was granted, and then moved for summary \njudgment on the ground that he was entitled to judicial immunity from a civil damages suit. \nId. at 222. Both the district court and court of appeals agreed that Judge White was immune \nfrom damages.  \n  The Supreme Court reversed. In so doing, it noted that โ[r]unning through our cases, \nwith fair consistency, is a โfunctionalโ approach to immunity questionsโ in which the court \nexamines the โnature of the functions with which a particular official or class of officials has \nbeen lawfully entrustedโ and seeks โto evaluate the effect that exposure to particular forms of \nliability would likely have on the appropriate exercise of those functions.โ Id. at 223. The \nCourt stated that difficulties have arisen in attempting to draw the line between truly judicial \nacts, for which immunity is appropriate, and acts that simply happen to have been done by a \njudge. Id. at 227. The Court reiterated that โimmunity is justified and defined by the functions \nit protects and serves, not by the person to whom it attachesโ but also noted that the Court \nโhas never undertaken to articulate a precise and general definition of the class of acts entitled \n10 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 10 of 37     Document 43\n\nto immunity.โ Id. The Court found, however, that the cases โsuggest an intelligible distinction \nbetween judicial acts and the administrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges \nmay on occasion be assigned by law to perform.โ Id.  \n  Thus,  the  Court  found  that  judicial  immunity  did  not  apply  to  acts  such  as \npromulgating a code of conduct for attorneys, which is not an act of adjudication but one of \nrulemaking.  Id.  at  228.  It  concluded  that  in  this  case,  Judge  White  was  acting  in  an \nadministrative capacity when he demoted and discharged Forrester. Id. at 229. The Court \nstated that while those acts may be quite important in providing the necessary conditions of \na sound adjudicative system, the decisions at issue, however, โwere not themselves judicial \nor adjudicative.โ Id. The Court stated that absolute immunity is a โstrong medicine, justified \nonly when the danger of [officialsโ being] deflect[ed from the effective performance of their \nduties] is very great.โ Id. at 230 (alteration in original). And in this case, the danger was โnot \ngreat enough.โ Id. The Court further found that it was not significant that under Illinois law, \nonly a judge could hire or fire probation officers, finding that: โTo conclude that, because a \njudge acts within the scope of his authority, such employment decisions are brought within \nthe courtโs โjurisdiction,โ or converted into โjudicial acts,โ would lift form above substance.โ \nId. Thus, the Court concluded that Judge White was not entitled to absolute immunity for the \ndecision to demote and discharge Forrester. Id.  \n  Three years later, in Mireles v. Waco, 502 U.S. 9 (1991), the Court again considered \nwhether a judge acted within his jurisdiction, and whether the alleged conduct was a judicial \nact. Id. at 11. The plaintiff was a public defender who was scheduled to appear before the \njudge. Id. at 10. After counsel failed to appear, the judge allegedly ordered law enforcement \nto forcibly and with excessive force seize and bring the attorney to the courtroom. Id. The \n11 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 11 of 37     Document 43\n\nCourt stated that case law makes clear that immunity is overcome in only two sets of \ncircumstancesโactions not taken in the judgeโs judicial capacity and actions taken in the \ncomplete absence of all jurisdiction. Id. at 11โ12. As to the first circumstance, in determining \nwhether an act falls within the judgeโs judicial capacity, the Court clarified that the relevant \ninquiry must be the nature and function of the act rather than the act itself. Id. at 13. In other \nwords,  one  must  look  to  the  particular  actโs  relation  to  the  general  function  normally \nperformed by a judge. Id.  \nFor instance, in this case, the judgeโs direction to the court officers to bring a person \nwho is in the courthouse before him is a function normally performed by a judge; however, a \njudgeโs direction to carry out a judicial order with excessive force is not. Id. at 12. The Court \nconcluded, however, that it cannot scrutinize only the particular act in question, because any \nmistake of a judge in excess of his authority would become nonjudicial as no improper act is \nโnormally performedโ by a judge. Id. The Court further explained that because judicial \nimmunity is immunity from suit, not just from damages, judicial immunity is not overcome \nby allegations of bad faith or malice, which ordinarily cannot be resolved without discovery \nand trial. Id. at 11.  \nAs to the second circumstance, the Court concluded that if the judge authorized and \nratified the police officersโ use of excessive force, he acted in excess of his authority; however, \nsuch an actionโtaken in the very aid of the judgeโs jurisdiction over a matter before himโ\ncannot be said to have been taken in the absence of jurisdiction. Id. at 13. Thus, the Court \nfound the judge immune.  \nIn sum, the doctrine that a judge enjoys absolute immunity from civil lawsuits for \nmonetary damages when engaging in judicial acts is solidly established. But see Pulliam v. Allen, \n12 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 12 of 37     Document 43\n\n466 U.S. 522 (1984) (concluding that judicial immunity is not a bar to prospective injunctive \nrelief against a judicial officer acting in her judicial capacity under ยง 1983, nor does it bar an \naward of attorneyโs fees under ยง 1988). This is not, however, a civil lawsuit; Dugan has been \ncriminally charged under federal statutes. Thus, the question is whether the clearly established \nprinciples governing judicial immunity in civil lawsuits applies to the criminal prosecutions \nof judges.   \n1.2  Judicial Immunity from Criminal Prosecution \nAs discussed above, Floyd was a criminal case. Thus, the first mention of judicial \nimmunity in the context of a criminal case goes back to Floyd. As cited above, the Supreme \nCourtโs first major application of judicial immunity was in the two post-Civil War era cases \nof Randall v. Brigham and Bradley v. Fisher. And as authority for judicial immunity in the civil \ncontext, the Randall and Bradley Courts invoked Floyd. However, although the Supreme Court \nlooked to Lord Cokeโs pronouncements as a starting point for judicial immunity in civil cases, \nin the 154 years since Bradley was decided, Dugan does not cite, and I have not found, cases \nwhere the Supreme Court invoked Floyd for the proposition that judicial immunity bars the \ncriminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts.  \nThe most we have gleaned from the Supreme Court about judicial immunity in the \ncontext of criminal cases have been in reference to 18 U.S.C. ยง 242, which is not charged in \nthis case. Section 242, the criminal analogue to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, allows for criminal \nprosecution for the deprivation of constitutional rights while acting under color of state law. \nThis criminal statute was passed as section 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866. See 136 Harv. L. \nRev. at 1467. Although the language of the statute itself does not address its applicability to \njudges, the legislative history of the bill is clear that its applicability to state actors, including \n13 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 13 of 37     Document 43\n\njudges, was of express concern to the drafters. In fact, in vetoing the bill, President Andrew \nJohnson was concerned that section 2 would subject judges to criminal prosecution if they \nโrender judgments in antagonism with its terms,โ asserting that the provision โinvades the \njudicial power of the State.โ CONG. GLOBE, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. 1680 (1866), available at \nhttps://www.congress.gov/congressional-globe/page-headings/39th-congress/(last  visited \nJuly 7, 2025).  \nUpon reconsidering the bill after veto, the billโs sponsor, Senator Lyman Trumbull, \nresponded that โa judge, if he acts corruptly or viciously in the execution or under color of an \nillegal act, may be and ought to be punished; but if he acted innocently the judge would not \nbe  punished.โ  CONG.  GLOBE,  39th  Cong.,  1st  Sess.  1758.  Similarly,  Representative \nWilliam Lawrence of Ohio stated that โit is better to invade the judicial power of the State \nthan permit it to invade, strike down, and destroy the civil rights of citizens. A judicial power \nperverted to such uses should be speedily invaded.โ CONG. GLOBE, 39th Cong., 1st Sess. \n1837. \nSubsequent to the Actโs passage, the Supreme Court upheld a judgeโs prosecution for \na constitutional violation in Ex parte Virginia, 100 U.S. 339 (1880). In this case, a state court \njudge was criminally charged for excluding Black jurors from jury selection in violation of the \nThirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments. Id. at 344. The judge argued that Congress could \nnot punish a state judge for his official acts and by selecting a jury, he was performing an \nofficial judicial act. Id. at 348. The Court disagreed, stating that the duty of selecting jurors is \na ministerial act; however, even if the act was judicial, the judge had no authority to select \njurors in violation of the Constitution. Id. at 348โ49.  \n14 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 14 of 37     Document 43\n\nApproximately 100 years later, while addressing judicial immunity in the civil context \nof ยง 1983, the Court invoked the threat of judicial prosecution under ยง 242 in response to \narguments that civil immunity provides no recourse against corrupt judges. See OโShea v. \nLittleton, 414 U.S. 488, 503 (1974) (โOn the contrary, the judicially fashioned doctrine of \nofficial immunity does not reach so far as to immunize criminal conduct proscribed by an Act \nof Congress.โ) (internal quotation and citation omitted); Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 429 \n(1976) (โEven judges, cloaked with absolute civil immunity for centuries, could be punished \ncriminally for willful deprivations of constitutional rights on the strength of 18 U.S.C. s 242, \nthe criminal analog of s 1983.โ); Dennis, 449 U.S. at 31 (โBut judicial immunity was not \ndesigned to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability. Judges are immune \nfrom ยง 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other \ncitizens.โ). \nIn sum, although the 17th Century English case of Floyd declared judges immune from \ncriminal prosecution for judicial acts, the Supreme Court has only cited Floyd in civil cases \nfor the proposition that judges are immune for purpose of civil damages. The only context in \nwhich the Supreme Court has spoken on judicial immunity from criminal prosecution is \nregarding ยง 242, and the Court found that judges are not immune from criminal prosecution \nunder this statute.  \n1.3   Duganโs Arguments \n  Dugan argues that English law and subsequent American common law begins with \nthe position of absolute judicial immunity save for very limited, specifically articulated \nexceptions,  such  as  Congressโ  statements  in  passing  ยง  242.  She  contends  that  without \nCongress similarly expressing an intent to abrogate the common law of judicial immunity for \n15 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 15 of 37     Document 43\n\ncriminal prosecution of judges under ยงยง 1071 and 1505, it follows that she is immune from \nprosecution under those statutes.  \nGuided by this history, Dugan contends that only three exceptions have been made in \nwhich judges can be criminally prosecuted, none of which applies to her case. First, she argues \nthat a judge can be prosecuted for her wholly unofficial acts. Second, she argues that a judge \ncan be prosecuted for criminal deprivation of a constitutional right under ยง 242. And third, \nshe argues that a judge can be prosecuted if she conducts an official act, but the act is coupled \nwith an ordinary crime for the pursuit of self-enrichment or self-gratification. (Docket # 21 at \n13โ14.) \n      1.3.1  Common Law \n  Floyd is at the foundation of Duganโs argument for the existence of absolute immunity \nto criminal prosecution for judicial acts. Floyd does pronounce such a rule. However, while \nreview of the history of judicial immunity supports that Lord Cokeโs pronouncements have \ntaken root in American common law regarding judicial immunity in civil cases, the same \ncannot be said regarding criminal prosecutions. As discussed above, the only time the \nSupreme Court has cited to Floyd has been in support of judicial immunity in a civil case. I \nam not persuaded, therefore, that Floyd has taken root in American common law to shield \njudges from criminal prosecution for judicial acts as Dugan asserts. \n   Dugan cites to several more recent (i.e., the 19th Century) lower court cases, where, \nin the context of a civil case against a judge, the court cited the general proposition that since \ncommon law, judges are exempt from โa civil suit, or indictment, for any act done, or omitted \nto be done by him, sitting as a judge.โ Hamilton v. Williams, 26 Ala. 527, 530 (1855); see also \nYates v. Lansing, 1810 WL 1044, at *7 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1810) (โThe doctrine which holds a \n16 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 16 of 37     Document 43\n\njudge exempt from a civil suit or indictment, for any act done, or omitted to be done by him, \nsitting as judge, has a deep root in the common law.โ). She also cites an Eighth Circuit case \nfrom two years ago, Rockett v. Eighmy, 71 F.4th 665 (8th Cir. 2023), in which the court states \nthat โ[j]udicial immunity continues to apply today, not only in prosecutions like Floyd, but in \ncivil-rights actions brought under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.โ Id. at 669. But again, these are not \ncriminal  cases  and  the  courtโs  brief  invocation  of  immunity  from  both  โcivil  suit  and \nindictmentโ provides weak support for the existence of a well-established principle of judicial \nimmunity for judicial acts in criminal cases.  \n  Dugan further cites several 20th Century cases that she again argues advances the \nconcept that judges are immune from criminal prosecution for their official acts not involving \nconstitutional rights. (Docket # 38 at 6.) These cases, however, are similarly unconvincing. \nShe cites Com. v. Tartar, 239 S.W.2d 265 (Ky. 1951), a case addressing whether a judge is \ncriminally immune for conducting โmisfeasance in office.โ (Docket # 21 at 9โ10.) The court \nin Tartar concluded that โmisfeasance of a judicial officer, acting in his official capacity, did \nnot constitute a criminal offense under the common law.โ 239 S.W.2d at 266. โMalfeasance \nor misfeasance in office,โ which some states make criminal either by statute or common law \nrule, precludes criminal liability by judicial immunity unless the malfeasance or misfeasance \nis accompanied by bad faith. Shaman, 27 San Diego L. Rev. at 18โ19. But Dugan is not \ncharged under a state statute or common law prohibition on malfeasance or misfeasance in \noffice,  she  is  charged  under  federal  criminal  statute  for  general  offenses  not  related  to \nmalfeasance or misfeasance in office. Thus, Tartar is inapposite.  \nDugan also cites to United States v. Chaplin, 54 F. Supp. 926 (S.D. Cal. 1944) in support \nof her argument. (Docket # 21 at 10.) In Chaplin, a judge was indicted for criminal conspiracy \n17 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 17 of 37     Document 43\n\nto deprive civil rights in violation of a precursor to 18 U.S.C. ยง 242. The court concluded that \nthe judge was criminally immune because he was acting within the scope of his judicial duties. \nWhile  the  court  acknowledged  the  Supreme  Courtโs  holding  in  Ex  parte  Virginia,  it \ndistinguished the case based on the fact that the Ex parte Virginia judge was performing a \nministerial rather than a judicial act in selecting jurors. Id. at 933. While the Ex parte Virginia \nCourt did find the judge was conducting a ministerial act, the Court also stated that even if \nthe selection of jurors could be considered a judicial act, the judge had no authority to exclude \njurors on the basis of their race. 100 U.S. at 348โ49. Furthermore, to the extent any doubt \nremained after Ex parte Virginia whether judges could be prosecuted for a criminal deprivation \nof  constitutional  rights,  all  doubt  was  removed  by  the  Supreme  Courtโs  subsequent \npronouncements in OโShea, Imbler, and Dennis. \nIn short, I am unconvinced that these cases establish settled law on judicial immunity \nfrom criminal prosecutions related to official judicial acts as exists in the context of a civil \nlawsuit for monetary damages.  \n1.3.2  Duganโs ยง 242 Argument \nDugan contends that without Congress expressing an intent to abrogate the common \nlaw of judicial immunity for criminal prosecution of judges under ยงยง 1071 and 1505 as it did \nfor prosecutions under ยง 242, it follows that she is immune from prosecution under those \nstatutes. This argument assumes the truth of two underlying premisesโ(1) that judicial \nimmunity from criminal prosecution is established in American common law and (2) that  \nยง 242 is an exception to that rule. As discussed above, the case for a common law judicial \nimmunity in criminal cases rests on Floyd and Floyd has only been cited by the Supreme Court \n18 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 18 of 37     Document 43\n\nin civil cases. Thus, there is weak evidence for the existence of a common law judicial \nimmunity from criminal prosecution for official judicial acts.  \nMoreover, arguing that the lack of judicial immunity from prosecution for a violation \nof ยง 242 establishes that judges are immune from criminal prosecution under every other \ncriminal statute overlooks the specific historical context in which ยง 242 was passed. And as \nthe government argues, must Congress comb through every federal criminal statute to indicate \nwhich statutes apply to judges and which do not? I am unconvinced that the absence of \njudicial immunity for violations of ยง 242 establishes that judges are immune for judicial acts \nunder all other criminal statutes. \n1.3.3  Duganโs Three Exceptions to Judicial Immunity \nAgain, Dugan asserts that there are only three categories of cases for which judges are \nnot immune from criminal prosecutions. First, a judge can be prosecuted for his wholly \nunofficial acts. Second, a judge can be prosecuted for criminal deprivation of a constitutional \nright under ยง 242. And third, a judge can be prosecuted if he conducts an official act, but the \nact is coupled with an ordinary crime for the pursuit of self-enrichment or self-gratification. \n(Docket # 21 at 13โ14.)  \n The first category, wholly unofficial acts, does not merit discussion. The parties do \nnot dispute that judges are not immune from prosecution for criminal acts wholly unrelated \nto their official duties. (Docket # 21 at 11.) Dugan cites, as an example, a state court judge in \nCalifornia who was recently convicted of murdering his wife as they watched television at \nhome. (Id. at 14 n.6.) No one contends that this judge could reasonably invoke judicial \nimmunity as a defense in that case.  \n19 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 19 of 37     Document 43\n\nDuganโs second category, criminal deprivation of constitutional rights under ยง 242, is \ndiscussed in depth above. Dugan is not charged under ยง 242 and agrees that judges are not \nimmune from prosecution under ยง 242. (Id. at 9.) Thus, I will not address this category further.  \nDuganโs third category of cases, where judges are prosecuted for actions related to \ntheir duties as judges but are coupled with self-serving criminal activity such as accepting \nbribes  or  kickbacks,  warrants  further  discussion.  Dugan  argues  that  these  cases  are \ndistinguishable from other crimes for immunity purposes because of their self-serving nature. \nShe contends that she, in contrast, was acting selflessly (Docket # 38 at 10) with โno hint of \nself-dealingโ (Docket # 21 at 21). But whether a judge seeks his own self-gratification or self-\nenrichment is not the distinguishing feature for immunity. What matters is whether the judge, \neven in performing her official duties, is accused of committing a crime.  \nTake, for example, the infamous โKids for Cashโ scheme in which two Pennsylvania \njudges,  Judges  Michael  Conahan  and  Mark  Ciavarella,  accepted  kickbacks  for  sending \njuveniles to particular private detention centers. Wallace v. Powell, No. CIV.A 3:09-CV-0291, \n2009 WL 4051974, *1 (M.D. Pa. Nov. 20, 2009). The judges were alleged to have used their \ninfluence as judicial officers to select the Pennsylvania Child Care and Western Pennsylvania \nChild Care as detention facilities, and intentionally filled those facilities with juveniles to earn \ntheir  co-conspirators  excessive  profits.  Id.  Judges  Conahan  and  Ciavarella  were  paid \napproximately $2.6 million for their influence. Id.  \nConahan was specifically alleged to have done, amongst other things, remove funding \nfrom the Luzerne County budget from the Luzerne County facility; sign a secret โPlacement \nGuarantee Agreementโ with the Pennsylvania Child Care on behalf of Luzerne County; and \ngrant an injunction which prevented the results of an audit of the Pennsylvania Child Care \n20 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 20 of 37     Document 43\n\nfacility from being disclosed to the public. Id. Ciavarella was alleged to have sentenced \nthousands of juveniles to detention in violation of their constitutional rights. Id. Both judges \nallegedly  pressured  court  probation  officers  to  make  recommendations  in  favor  of \nincarcerating juvenile offenders; concealed their unlawful proceeds; and failed to disclose \ntheir financial relationships with the other defendants. Id.  \nThe judges were civilly sued under ยง 1983 for their actions. The court, considering the \nSupreme Courtโs jurisprudence on judicial immunity to date, found that judges have absolute \nimmunity for conduct pursuant to their role as judicial officers. Id. at *6. The court determined \nthat judicial immunity applies if a judge has jurisdiction over the dispute and conducted a \njudicial act, as opposed to an administrative, executive, or legislative one. Id. at *7. The \nplaintiffs  argued  that  because  the  judgesโ  decisions  were  made  corruptly,  or  in  a \npredetermined fashion, they were not judicial acts. Id. at *8. The court disagreed, stating, for \nexample, that the allegation that Conahan had a corrupt motive for issuing an injunction was \nno different than the allegations against the judge in Dennis, where the Supreme Court found \njudicial immunity. Id. The court stated that Ciavarellaโs determinations of delinquency and \nsentences imposed were judicial acts, and the fact they were made corruptly or with malice \nwas irrelevant. Id. However, to the extent the judgesโ actions were not judicial in nature, such \nas Conahanโs signing of a โPlacement Agreementโ or the budget requests, judicial immunity \ndid not shield this conduct. Id.  \nThe court acknowledged that because of judicial immunity, Ciavarella would escape \ncivil liability for the vast majority of his conduct, no matter how corrupt. Id. at *9. The court \nalso stated, however, citing OโShea, that the judges were still subject to criminal prosecution, \nnoting that the โjudges here have been indicted by a federal grand jury for the conduct for \n21 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 21 of 37     Document 43\n\nwhich damages are sought in this case.โ Id. at *6. And Judges Conahan and Ciavarella were \nindeed indicted under federal racketeering laws. (See Indictment, Docket # 1 in United States \nv. Conahan, et al., Case No. 09-CR-272 (M.D. Penn. 2009).) \nWhat the โKids for Cashโ case shows is that while judges may be civilly immune for \njudicial acts, regardless of their motives, it does not follow that they are also criminally \nimmune for their wholly judicial acts. Recall, the court found that Ciavarellaโs determinations \nof delinquency and sentences were clearly judicial acts. And while judicial immunity shielded \nhim from civil liability, it did not protect him from criminal prosecution for the same acts.  \nDugan cites to United States v. Claiborne, 727 F.2d 842 (9th Cir. 1984) as a โclose callโ \nregarding whether a judge is truly conducting wholly official acts in the context of criminal \nimmunity. (Docket # 38 at 3.) In Claiborne, a federal judge was indicted for soliciting and \nreceiving $30,000.00 from a Nevada brothel owner in return for being influenced in the \nperformance of official acts, specifically, decisions regarding motions in a pending case. The \njudge was further accused of accepting money from this same individual in return for \npromising to secure the reversal of his criminal tax evasion conviction by bribing one or more \nof the judges of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Id. at 843. In finding the judge was not \nimmune from criminal prosecution, the court stated that the โConstitution does not immunize \na sitting federal judge from the processes of criminal law.โ Id. at 845.  \nThe court rejected the argument that judicial independence would be diminished by \nsubjecting judges to criminal prosecution. Id. at 848. The court found that judges enjoy the \nsame  protection  as  ordinary  citizens  from  vindictive  prosecution  and  that  criminal \nprosecution โencounters several procedural barriers-such as the indictment, burden of proof, \nand presumption of innocence.โ Id. The court further concluded that โcriminal conduct is not \n22 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 22 of 37     Document 43\n\npart of the necessary functions performed by public officialsโ and punishment for such \nconduct would not interfere with the operation of a branch of government. Id. Rather, it โcan \nscarcely be doubted that the citizenry would justifiably lose respect for and confidence in a \nsystem of government under which judges were apparently held to be above the processes of \nthe criminal law.โ Id. at 849. \nDugan argues that in Claiborne, the judge, despite conducting the judicial acts of \nhandling motions, โsold his office.โ (Docket # 38 at 3.) While true, this fact does not make \nClaiborne a โclose callโ as to whether immunity would apply. Rather, Claiborne reiterates the \naccepted principle that even when performing clearly judicial acts, such as deciding motions \nin a pending case, a judge is not immune from criminal prosecution for committing crimes \nwhile conducting the judicial act. While many of these cases involve crimes where the judgeโs \nmotivation was financial gain, it does not follow and there is no authority for the proposition \nthat criminal prosecution is limited to such cases.  \n1.3.4  Duganโs Reliance on Trump v. United States \nFinally, Dugan cites to the Supreme Courtโs recent decision in Trump v. United States, \n603 U.S. 593 (2024), where the Court found the President absolutely immune for criminal \nprosecution  for  conduct  within  his  exclusive  sphere  of  constitutional  authority.  While \nacknowledging that Trump was addressing immunity in the context of the President, Dugan \nargues that the Court indirectly addresses judicial immunity because, in her view, Trumpโs \npronouncement of Presidential immunity is grounded in the proposition that judges have \nabsolute immunity in criminal cases for judicial acts.  \nIn Trump, like here, the parties did not dispute that criminal immunity does not apply \nto a Presidentโs unofficial acts. See id. at 615. As to official acts, however, in arguing the \n23 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 23 of 37     Document 43\n\nPresident is absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for acts within the outer perimeter \nof his official responsibilities, President Trump looked to Nixon v. Fitzgerald, a civil case in \nwhich  the  Court  concluded  that,  โIn  view  of  the  special  nature  of  the  Presidentโs \nconstitutional office and functions, we think it appropriate to recognize absolute Presidential \nimmunity  from  damages  liability  for  acts  within  the  โouter  perimeterโ  of  his  official \nresponsibility.โ Id. at 606 (citing Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 756). Trump argued that given the \nCourtโs  pronouncement  in  Fitzgerald  regarding  civil  immunity  for  acts  on  the  โouter \nperimeter,โ he must be absolutely immune from criminal prosecution for such acts as well. \nId.  \nThe Court agreed, finding that the โnature of Presidential power requires that a former \nPresident have some immunity from criminal prosecution for official acts during his tenure \nin office,โ and with respect to the exercise of his โcore constitutional powers,โ the immunity \nmust be absolute. Id. As to non-core official actions falling within the โouter perimeterโ of his \nofficial responsibilities, the Court concluded that the President has at least a presumptive \nimmunity from criminal prosecutions. Id. at 614. The Court found that the government can \novercome this presumption by showing that applying a criminal prohibition to the act would \npose no dangers of intrusion on the authority and functions of the Executive Branch. Id. at \n615.  \nIn coming to this conclusion, the Court reiterated that the President is not above the \nlaw. Id. at 642. It stated that the โPresident, charged with enforcing federal criminal laws, is \nnot above them.โ Id. at 614. However, the Court also found that it had to balance two \ncompeting interestsโthe Presidentโs ability to execute the duties of his office โfearlessly and \nfairlyโ and the fact that federal criminal law seeks to redress a wrong to the public as a whole, \n24 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 24 of 37     Document 43\n\nnot just to an individual. Id. at 614. In finding this balance, the Court concluded that the \nseparation of powers principles necessitate the President having absolute immunity for core \nconstitutional powers and at least a presumptive immunity for all official acts. Id. at 642. \nDugan argues that because the Trump decision repeatedly relied on Fitzgerald, and \nbecause Fitzgerald was rooted in cases applying absolute judicial immunity, it follows that \nTrump, in fact, simply โclarified that the President is entitled to the same immunity from \nprosecution for official conduct that judges have long held.โ (Docket # 21 at 10โ11.) While \nDugan  asserts  that  Trump  simply  extended  to  the  President  the  same  immunity  from \nprosecution that judges already have, this argument makes a leap too far. Trump says nothing \nabout criminal immunity for judicial acts. And in Fitzgerald, while the Supreme Court looked \nto the historical jurisprudence regarding civil judicial immunity, the Court was clear that the \ngrant of absolute immunity for civil damages for โouter perimeterโ acts of the President was \ndue to the โspecial nature of the Presidentโs constitutional office and functions.โ Fitzgerald, \n457 U.S. at 756. Similarly in Trump, the Court noted that the President occupies a unique \nposition in the constitutional scheme as the only person who alone composes a branch of \ngovernment. 603 U.S. at 610.  \nEven so, absolute criminal immunity exists only for a Presidentโs โcore constitutional \npowers,โ meaning those powers specifically articulated in the constitution, such as the power \nto pardon and the power to veto. See id. at 634. It is in those limited cases, because of the \nseparation of powers, that a Presidentโs motive cannot be considered. Id. at 618. Thus, even \nif a president is accused of taking a bribe to grant a pardon, because a pardon is a โcoreโ \npower given to the President by the constitution, it would violate the separation of powers for \nthe judicial branch to question it. However, for the non-core powers, the Supreme Court did \n25 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 25 of 37     Document 43\n\nnot grant the President blanket immunity, instead saying these acts are only presumptively \nimmune and this immunity could be overcome by showing that criminal prohibition posed \nno dangers of intrusion on the separation of powers. Id. at 615. \nPerhaps in some future case the Supreme Court will expand the judicial immunity \nprinciples it has so firmly established in the civil context to the criminal prosecution of judges \nas Dugan urges. At this time, however, I am unconvinced that either the common law or the \nTrump decision provide the authority for applying the civil framework of absolute judicial \nimmunity for judicial acts to the prosecution of judges for crimes that relate to official duties. \n2.  Summary of the Existing Law on Judicial Immunity  \nHaving reviewed the law on judicial immunity in both the civil and criminal contexts \nand having considered the partiesโ arguments on the existing precedent, the applicable law \ncan be summarized as follows. In the civil context, it is well-established and undisputed that \njudges have absolute immunity from civil lawsuits for monetary damages when engaging in \njudicial acts. While it is not always crystal clear what constitutes a โjudicial act,โ the Supreme \nCourt counsels courts to consider whether the act is a function normally performed by a judge \nand whether the parties dealt with the judge in his judicial capacity. See Stump, 435 U.S. at \n362. The Court has stated there is an intelligible distinction between judicial acts and the \nadministrative, legislative, or executive functions that judges may on occasion be assigned by \nlaw to perform. Forrester, 484 U.S. at 227. The Court has articulated that judicial immunity is \nnot overcome by allegations of bad faith or malice. Mireles, 502 U.S. at 11.  \nIn the criminal context, review of the case law supports the following. First, judges are \nnot immune from criminal prosecution for acts wholly outside their official roles as judges. \nDugan cites several examples that fit into this category, such as a state court judge who was \n26 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 26 of 37     Document 43\n\nconvicted of murdering his wife as they watched television at home and a state court judge \nwho was convicted of sexual battery of a female lawyer in his chambers. (Docket # 21 at 14 \nn.6.)  \nSecond, judges are not immune from prosecution for the criminal deprivation of \nconstitutional rights under 18 U.S.C. ยง 242.  \nAnd third, judges are not shielded by judicial immunity from criminal prosecution for \nacts, though related to official duties, are in violation of criminal law. See, e.g., Claiborne, 727 \nF.2d 842; Wallace v. Powell, 2009 WL 4051974.  \n3.  Application of Judicial Immunity to the Allegations in the Indictment \n  Applying the principles above, does judicial immunity shield Dugan from prosecution \nbecause the indictment alleges she violated federal criminal law while performing judicial \nduties? The answer is no. As discussed above, there is no firmly established absolute judicial \nimmunity barring criminal prosecution of judges for judicial acts. Other than the 17th Century \nEnglish case of Floyd, the United States Supreme Court has only applied the concept of \njudicial immunity for judicial acts in civil cases. Even before the lower courts, with the \nexception of the single โmalfeasance in officeโ case cited by Dugan, the cases Dugan cites in \nsupport of her argument arise in the civil context.    \nFurther, the category of cases where judges were prosecuted for conduct performed in \ntheir official role also answers this question in the negative. For example, in the โKids for \nCashโ scheme described above, sentencing juveniles is indisputably within the scope of a \njudgeโs official duties. Thus, the Wallace court found the judges immune from civil suit. 2009 \nWL 4051974, at *9. The judges were still, however, prosecuted criminally because even \n27 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 27 of 37     Document 43\n\nthough the judges were performing official duties, their otherwise criminal conduct did not \nshield them from prosecution.   \n   As discussed earlier, Dugan tries to distinguish her case by arguing that the charged \nacts are โdevoid of the self-enrichment or self-gratification that marks earlier cases in which \njudges were convicted for using judicial status as leverage or opportunity for a bribe, kickback, \nor favor, or to commit another crime.โ (Docket # 21 at 20.) Again, the distinction that takes \nthese official duty cases out of the shield of immunity is not self-enrichment or the motive of \nthe judge. It is whether the criminal law has been violated. In other words, a judgeโs actions, \neven when done in her official capacity, does not bar criminal prosecution if the actions were \ndone in violation of the criminal law. \nFurthermore, consider the only case with similar allegations to this case. In United \nStates v. Joseph, a judge on the Massachusetts District Court, Judge Shelley Richmond Joseph, \nwas, similar to Dugan here, federally charged with obstruction of justice and obstruction of a \nfederal proceeding in violation of ยงยง 1512 and 1505. In that case, an ICE officer working for \nthe Department of Homeland Security arrived at the courthouse to take into custody an \nindividual who had been arrested days earlier who was allegedly the subject of an immigration \ndetainer and warrant based on a final order of removal. United States v. Richmond Joseph, No. \n19-CR-10141, 2020 WL 4288425, at *1 (D. Mass. July 27, 2020). The DHS intended to detain \nthe individual and effect his removal from the United States in the event he was released from \nstate custody. Id. Joseph allegedly facilitated this individualโs departure from the courthouse \nusing the rear sally port door of the lockup on the courthouseโs lower level, rather than \nthrough the main door leading from the courtroom to the lobby where the ICE officer was \nwaiting. Id.  \n28 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 28 of 37     Document 43\n\nJoseph moved to dismiss the indictment on judicial immunity grounds and the parties \nโhotly contest[ed]โ whether judicial immunity insulates against criminal liability or was \nrestricted to civil lawsuits. Id. at *3. The district court declined to resolve the question, finding \nthat even if judicial immunity did extend to the criminal context, it would only apply where \na judge performed judicial acts within her jurisdiction. Id. And in this case, the indictment \nalleged that Joseph acted โcorruptlyโ and such immunity, to the extent it exists, does not \nshield corruption or bribery. Id. The court concluded that it was โnot within this Courtโs \nprovince on a motion to dismiss to determine whether judicial immunity, even if its reach \nencompasses criminal liability, provides a viable shelter for Joseph in the circumstances \nalleged here.โ Id.1  \nThe indictment here, as in Joseph, alleges that Dugan acted โcorruptly.โ (Docket # 6 \nat 2.) And as the Joseph court found, to the extent immunity exists in the criminal context, it \ndoes not shield against corruption. In my view, this is consistent with the cases where judges \nwere prosecuted for performing official acts that were intertwined with bribery or extortionโ\neven where judges are acting in their official role, when the judicial acts violate criminal law, \njudicial immunity does not bar prosecution. \nI agree with Dugan and the amicus brief of the former judges that a judge plays many \nroles when sitting on the bench in a courtroom. She must not only interpret and apply the law \nto the facts, she must also ensure the efficient running of her courtroom. Thus, I agree that \n \n1 Joseph appealed the district courtโs denial on judicial immunity grounds. The First Circuit dismissed the appeal, \nconcluding that it lacked jurisdiction to review the district courtโs dismissal โbased on her asserted common-law \ndefense of judicial immunity.โ United States v. Joseph, 26 F.4th 528, 534 (1st Cir. 2022). As Dugan does here, \nJoseph argued that judicial immunity protected her against not just conviction, but against prosecution. Id. at \n533. The First Circuit disagreed, finding that โjudicial immunity -- even assuming that it applies in this criminal \ncase -- does not provide a right not to be tried that can serve as a basis for interlocutory review.โ Id. The court \nultimately concluded that Joseph could not obtain interlocutory review of her judicial immunity defense unless \nshe could show that her claimed right not to be tried was explicitly grounded in a statute or the Constitution, \nwhich she could not do, relying instead on common law. Id. at 534.  \n29 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 29 of 37     Document 43\n\ndetermining whether a warrant establishes probable cause; directing people outside her \ncourtroom to talk with the Chief Judge about a planned arrest; addressing a case off the \nrecord; telling people in her courtroom what door to use to re-enter the public hallway; and \nallowing a party to appear by Zoom are all part of a judgeโs job. I also agree with Dugan and \nthe former judges that the appellate courts are the proper forum to address disagreements with \na trial judgeโs opinions, errors, or mistakes. However, I do not agree that the case law supports \nthat these judicial acts bar prosecution where the indictment alleges that the acts were done \nโcorruptlyโ or to facilitate violation of the criminal law.  \nAt bottom, the indictment does not charge Dugan for โopining on the fly,โ managing \nher courtroom, or allowing someone to appear by Zoom for future hearings. There are no, \nand there cannot be, federal statutes criminalizing such conduct. Rather, the indictment \ncharges Dugan with violating federal criminal laws by (1) โknowingly conceal[ing] E.F.R., a \nperson for whose arrest a warrant and process had been issued under the provisions of the law \nof the United States, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of E.F.R., after notice and \nknowledge of the fact that a warrant and process had been issued for the apprehension of \nE.F.R., in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 107โ and by (2) โcorruptly endeavor[ing] to influence, \nobstruct, and impede the due and proper administration of the law under which a pending \nproceeding was being had before a department and agency of the United States, namely the \nadministrative arrest of E.F.R. for purposes of removal proceedings conducted by the United \nStates Department of Homeland Security, in violation of 18 U.S.C. ยง 1505.โ \nThis conclusion does not leave judges acting in their official capacities or judicial \nindependence at the mercy of prosecutors. As the Ninth Circuit stated in Claiborne, judges \nenjoy the โsame protections as ordinary citizens from vindictive prosecution.โ 727 F.2d at \n30 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 30 of 37     Document 43\n\n848. A prosecutor seeking to charge a judge of a criminal offense, if proceeding by criminal \ncomplaint as was the case here, must satisfy the reviewing judge that there is probable cause \na federal crime has been committed. Additionally, the prosecutor must then present his case \nto a grand jury as required by the Fifth Amendment. And ultimately, the prosecutor must \nprove each of the elements of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt to a unanimous \njury of twelve citizens.  \nFor these reasons, I recommend that Duganโs motion to dismiss the indictment based \non judicial immunity be denied.   \n4.  Tenth Amendment \nNext, Dugan argues that her prosecution violates the Tenth Amendmentโs separation \nof powers. (Docket # 21 at 23โ31.) The Tenth Amendment provides that: โThe powers not \ndelegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \nreserved to the States respectively, or to the people.โ U.S. Const. amend. X. The Tenth \nAmendment โrestrains the power of Congress, but this limit is not derived from the text of \nthe  Tenth  Amendment  itself,  which,  . . .  is  essentially  a  tautology.  Instead,  the  Tenth \nAmendment confirms that the power of the Federal Government is subject to limits that may, \nin a given instance, reserve power to the States.โ New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, 156โ\n57 (1992).  \nDugan argues that the federal government, through its executive branch, lacks power \nto exact criminal punishment on a state court judge for โdoing in and near her state courtroom \nas the indictment contends.โ (Docket # 21 at 26.) The crux of Duganโs argument is that her \nprosecution  under  federal  law  effectively  overrides  the  State  of  Wisconsinโs  ability  to \nadminister its courts, stating that the Constitution does not allow the federal government โto \n31 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 31 of 37     Document 43\n\nsuperintend the administration and case-by-case daily functioning of state courts as this \nindictment proposes.โ (Id. at 27.)  \nIn Joseph, the Massachusetts judge and her co-defendant courtroom deputy raised a \nsimilar Tenth Amendment challenge. They argued that they were being charged for their \nlawful decision not to assist ICE in administering immigration laws, for the judgeโs decisions \nregarding how to manage her courtroom, and for the deputyโs exercise of his daily duties. \n2020 WL 4288425, at *4. The district court found that addressing these constitutional \narguments  โrequire  the  assessment  of  disputed  facts,  characterizations  of  the  events \nunderlying the Indictment, or other evidentiary analysis. Such fact-laden determinations are \noutside the scope of a motion to dismiss.โ Id.  \n The same is true here. The indictment alleges Dugan violated two federal statutes, 18 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 1071 and 1505, and cites the respective statutory language for both. Whether Dugan \nviolated these statutes as the government accuses, or whether she was merely performing her \njudicial duties as Dugan asserts, these are questions for a jury that cannot be resolved on a \nmotion to dismiss. Additionally, that the allegations could also be addressed, or are better \naddressed,  by  the  stateโs  own  judicial  discipline  procedures  does  not,  as  a  matter  of \nconstitutional law, require dismissal of the indictment.2 For these reasons, I recommend \nDuganโs motion to dismiss on Tenth Amendment grounds be denied.   \n  5.  The Constitutional Avoidance Doctrine \n  Finally, Dugan invokes the canon of constitutional avoidance to support dismissal of \nthe indictment. Duganโs invocation of this canon, however, is misplaced. Constitutional \n \n2 In fact, the Joseph case was ultimately resolved with the government agreeing to drop the criminal case in \nexchange for Josephโs agreement to self-report to the state judicial discipline body. See Massachusetts Judge \nFaces New Scrutiny for Alleged Role in Immigration Case, available at https://courtscast.com/massachusetts-\njudge-faces-new-scrutiny-for-alleged-role-in-immigration-case/(last visited July 7, 2025).  \n32 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 32 of 37     Document 43\n\navoidance is a canon of statutory construction that comes into play when the language of a \nstatute  is  ambiguous;  the  canon  is  โa  tool  for  choosing  between  competing  plausible \ninterpretationsโ of the statute. Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.S. 40, 50 (2014) (internal quotations \nand citations omitted). It counsels courts to first ascertain whether a construction of the statute \nis fairly possible to allow avoidance of the constitutional question. Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \nU.S. 281, 296 (2018). The canon has โno application,โ however, โin the absence of . . . \nambiguity.โ Warger, 574 U.S. at 50 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \n  Dugan first invokes the canon to argue that the two statutes under which she is \nchargedโยงยง 1071 and 1505โconflict with the Constitution based on the Tenth Amendment \nargument she raises above and based on the โintersectionโ between judicial immunity, rooted \nin the common law, and Congressโ enforcement of ยง 242 against state actors, including judges. \n(Docket # 21 at 33.) She argues that the Court can avoid constitutional questions by deciding \nthe case on immunity grounds rather than addressing the Tenth Amendment issue. (Id. at 33โ\n34.) Again, this is not how the canon of constitutional avoidance is used. Dugan does not \nallege  ambiguity  in  either  statute  that  would  require  the  Court  to  consider  a  plausible \ninterpretation  in  harmony  with  the  Constitution.  She  is  simply  repackaging  her  Tenth \nAmendment argument, which, for the reasons explained above, cannot be resolved on a \nmotion to dismiss.   \n  Dugan next invokes the canon to argue that the Court could โeasily and rightlyโ \nconstrue ยงยง 1071 and 1505 to avoid any constitutional concern. (Id. at 34.) But Dugan does \nnot raise any constitutional concerns with either statute. She argues that the indictment fails \nto  allege  conduct  that  constitutes  โconcealmentโ  under  ยง  1071.  (Id.)  This  is  not  a \nconstitutional issue; it is a factual issue to be resolved at trial. She further argues that the \n33 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 33 of 37     Document 43\n\nindictment fails to allege a โproceedingโ within the meaning of ยง 1505. (Id.) The indictment \nalleges that Dugan interfered with the removal proceedings of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. While she argues that such removal proceedings cannot, as a matter of law, \nconstitute a โproceedingโ for purposes of the statute, once again, she is not arguing that the \nstatute is ambiguous.  \nThus,  neither  of  these  questions  invoke  the  use  of  the  canon  of  constitutional \navoidance. Dugan raises no questions of ambiguity in the statutes, and I see none to address. \nThus, I recommend Duganโs motion to dismiss be denied as to this ground as well.  \n6.   Factual Disputes Not Properly Resolved on Motion to Dismiss \nIn litigating this motion, the parties contest both facts alleged in the indictment and \nfacts beyond what is alleged in the indictment. This too counsels against dismissal. The court \ncannot resolve disputed questions of fact on a motion to dismiss. See Abramson, 2023 WL \n349842, at *3. For example, Dugan argues that the federal agents disrupted her courtroom on \nApril 18 to effectuate the arrest (Docket # 15 at 5), while the government asserts that the \nevidence at trial will show that the agents did not disrupt any proceedings, rather, Dugan \naffirmatively chose to pause an unrelated case, leave her courtroom, interrupt a colleagueโs \nproceedings to get her assistance, and then confront the agents in the public hallway (Docket \n# 28 at 6โ7). Dugan further argues that she had a right to make decisions involving her \ncourtroom and cases, including directing individuals to use a certain door, conducting a case \noff the record, and opining โoff the cuffโ on a legal issue and the federal law enforcement \nagents improperly interfered with her right to make those decisions. (Docket # 38 at 10โ12.) \nThe government, however, asserts that Dugan was not simply trying to run her courtroom, \nbut intentionally misdirected the agents to the Chief Judgeโs office, knowing he was not there, \n34 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 34 of 37     Document 43\n\nand then escorted E.F.R. into a non-public hallway with access to a stairwell leading to a \ncourthouse exit to help him evade arrest. (Docket # 28 at 6โ7.)  \n Dugan disputes the governmentโs version of events and the government will have the \nburden of proving its allegations beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. However, these contested \nfacts cannot be resolved at this juncture.  \n7.   Arguments of the Amici  \n  Two separate parties have moved for leave to file amicus curiae (friend of the court) \nbriefs in this case. The first motion was filed by 138 former state and federal judges from \nacross the United States. (Docket # 25.) These judges seek to file an amicus brief in support \nof granting Duganโs motion to dismiss the indictment. The second motion was filed by the \nCenter for American Rights. (Docket # 32.) This organization seeks to file an amicus brief in \nsupport of denial of Duganโs motion to dismiss. Both motions are granted, and I thank the \namici for their time and contribution to the consideration of the important issues presented \nby this motion. \nGenerally, because amici are not parties to the case, they cannot raise issues not \nadvanced by the parties. See, e.g., Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 97 n.4 (1991) \n(โ[W]e do not ordinarily address issues raised only by amiciโ); Butler v. Daimler Trucks N. Am., \nLLC, 74 F.4th 1131, 1144 n.4 (10th Cir. 2023) (finding that because an โamicus is not a party,โ \nthe court โordinarily decline[s] to consider arguments raised only by an amicusโ); Dalombo \nFontes v. Gonzales, 498 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2007) (โ[W]e will not address an issue raised by an \namicus that was not seasonably raised by a party to the case.โ); Christopher M. by Laveta McA. \nv. Corpus Christi Indep. Sch. Dist., 933 F.2d 1285, 1293 (5th Cir. 1991) (โAbsent exceptional \n35 \n \nCase 2:25-cr-00089-LA-NJ     Filed 07/07/25     Page 35 of 37     Document 43\n\ncircumstances, an issue waived by appellant cannot be raised by amicus curiae.โ). Thus, I \nhave disregarded any challenges articulated by the amici that were not raised by either party. \nCONCLUSION \n  It is well-established and undisputed that judges have absolute immunity from civil \nlawsuits for monetary damages when engaging in judicial acts. This, however, is not a civil \ncase. And review of the case law does not show an extension of this established doctrine to \nthe  criminal  context.  Accordingly,  I  recommend  that  Duganโs  motion  to  dismiss  the \nindictment on judicial immunity grounds be denied. I also recommend that the court declines \nher invitation to dismiss the indictment on Tenth Amendment grounds and on the canon of \nconstitutional avoidance. Finally, it is important to note that nothing said here speaks to the \nmerits of the allegations against Dugan. Dugan is presumed innocent, and innocent she \nremains,  unless  and  until  the  government  proves  the  allegations  against  her  beyond  a \nreasonable doubt to a jury at trial.  \nNOW, THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED that Duganโs Motion to Dismiss \nthe Indictment (Docket # 15) be DENIED.  \nIT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the motions to file amicus briefs (Docket # 25 and \nDocket # 32) are GRANTED. \nThe motion for supplemental jury questionnaire (Docket # 24) will be addressed by \nJudge Adelman.  \nYour attention is directed to General L.R. 72(c), 28 U.S.C. ยง 636(b)(1)(B) and Federal \nRules of Criminal Procedure 59(b), or Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 72(b) if applicable, \nwhereby written objections to any recommendation or order herein, or part thereof, may be \nfiled within fourteen days of the date of service of this recommendation or order.
