This investigation is authorized by, and will be\nconducted pursuant to, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized\nPersons Act, 42 U.S.C. Section 1997, et seq.\nThe purpose of the investigation will be to determine\nwhether there exist any violations of the statutory and federal\nconstitutional rights of BRC residents.  The investigation will\nfocus on, but not necessarily be limited to, allegations related\nto an inadequate number of professional and direct care staff,\nabuse and neglect of residents, misuse and overuse of restraints,\ninadequate recordkeeping practices, and the failure to provide\ntreatment sufficient to avoid undue risks to personal safety\nand unreasonable bodily restraint.  The initiation of this\ninvestigation in no way evidences any prejudgment on our part\nthat patient federal rights have been violated.  If any\nviolations are found, we look forward to conferring with you\nand your staff concerning corrective actions that might be\nappropriate.\nAs a means of commencing this investigation, I wish to\npropose an initial meeting in the near future between our\nattorneys and representatives of your office.  It has been our\nexperience that such a preliminary conference can substantially\nexpedite the process.  We also wish to arrange for our attorneys,\n\nconsultants, and perhaps agents of the Federal Bureau of\nInvestigation to visit the Boswell Retardation Center.  We shall\nbe in touch with your staff to work out the specifics of our\nmeeting and later visits.

      "text": "Civil Rights Division\nOffice of the Anistant Attorney General  Washington. DC. 20530\nREGISTERED MAIL\nRETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED  .1\nrN0V I I T997\nHonorable Ray Mabus  .,\no\n(\"nuornnr  U^\"\nJackson, Mississippi  39201  MRJs-002 002\nRe:  Boswell Retardation Center\nDear Governor Mabus:\nOn July 23, 1990, we notified you of our intention to\ninvestigate conditions at the Boswell Retardation Center\n(Boswell) in Sanatorium, Mississippi pursuant to the Civil Rights\nof Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. ยง 1997.  As\ncontemplated by the statute, we are now writing to inform you of\nthe findings of our investigation and to outline the minimum\nmeasures necessary to remedy the unconstitutional conditions at\nBoswell.\nAs part of our investigation, attorneys from the Department\nof Justice toured Boswell for three days in November 1990 with\ntwo consultant psychologists.  We observed residents, interviewed\nstaff, and reviewed records and documentation.  Throughout the\ninvestigation, representatives of both the Department of Mental\nHealth and the facility were helpful and cooperative.  We\nappreciate their efforts.\nOur investigation reveals that conditions at Boswell exist\nwhich deprive residents of their constitutional rights.\nInstitutionalized mentally retarded persons have constitutional\nrights to adequate medical care, reasonably safe conditions of\nconfinement, and such training as would ensure that they are not\nexposed to unreasonable risks to their personal safety and are\nfree from undue bodily restraint.  Youngberg v. Romeo.  4 57  U.S.\n307,  324 (1982).  Conditions at Boswell contravene the residents'\nconstitutional rights in a manner far more egregious than\nencountered in our investigation of the Ellisville State School.\n)  Set out below are our findings and recommendations.  The\n)  unconstitutional conditions revealed by our investigation include\nBoswell's failure to provide minimally adequate training programs\nsufficient to ensure that residents are free from undue\n\n- 2 -\nrestraint, insufficient numbers and training of staff, inadequate\npsychiatric care and recordkeeping, and a physical environment\nwhich threatens the health and safety of residents.\nNotwithstanding these findings, we wish to acknowledge\nBoswell's vocational rehabilitation programs which were\nnoteworthy for those residents served in terms of their\nstructure, management and efficacy.\n\"I. Inadequate Training Programs\nOur consultants considered Boswell's training programs to be\ntotally inadequate and failing to meet acceptable professional\nstandards.  One consultant, Dr. Johnny Matson, rated the programs\n/'as among 5% of the poorest I have seen at facilities around the\n\"country in the last 10 years.\"\nBoswell fails to provide professionally designed and\nimplemented individualized training programs that are sufficient\nto ensure that residents are not subjected to unreasonable\nrestraints.  Following a careful review, our consultant\npsychologists concluded that Boswell's staff are using\nrestraints, isolation and punishment to control the behavior of\nresidents in lieu of necessary training programs.\nBoswell's staff fail to identify and eliminate circumstances\nwhich provoke problem behaviors in residents.  After the onset of\na maladaptive episode, staff intervention is focused solely on\nrestraining the resident or using aversives without resorting to\nalternatives.  Our consultants noted that these procedures are a\nsubstantial departure from accepted professional practice.\nCurrent behavior programs are not data based and thereby do\nnot meet professional standards.  For example, Boswell has no\nadequate facility-wide behavioral observation system that is used\nconsistently and reliably by all staff to collect behavioral\ndata.  In addition, because staff fail to provide behavioral data\nto the consultant psychiatrist for evaluation of the need for\ncontinued medication, he is accordingly limited in his ability to\ndetermine whether medication may be tapered or withdrawn which\nplaces residents at risk of undue chemical restraint.\nThere is also inadequate behavioral programming for\nresidents taking psychotropic medication.  What programming does\nexist, moreover, is not integrated with the use of psychotropic\nmedication which places residents at risk of undue chemical\nrestraint.\nThe psychology policy manual appears to have been adapted\nfrom several sources and is internally inconsistent.  In\n'addition, interviews with the psychology staff strongly suggested\nthat they do not understand some of the basic concepts in the\n\n- 3 -\nmanual, such as reliability, and that they routinely fail to\nfollow its guidelines.\nII. Insufficient Numbers and Training of Staff\nThere is an insufficient number of qualified medical and\npsychology staff at Boswell to provide minimally adequate care\nand training for the resident population or to render\nprofessional judgments with respect to such care and training.\nConsequently, Boswell's residents are not receiving the care and\ntraining necessary to protect them from unreasonable risks to\ntheir personal safety and to ensure freedom from undue bodily\nrestraint.\nThe most glaring staffing deficiency is in the area of\nโขpsychology.  The psychology department's current 1:70 staff-to-\nresident ratio is totally inadequate given the behavioral\nprogramming that is necessary with this resident population.  The\nabsence of a departmental supervisor responsible for all staff\npsychologists further contributes to programmatic incoherence and\ndisjointedness.\nPsychology staff suffer from lack of training in basic\nbehavioral psychology.  This educational deficit greatly\nundermines the quality of the behavior reduction programs\ncurrently in place at Boswell.  Until training is provided to\ninstruct psychologists how to gather and process data linking\nassessment to treatment, the facility's behavior programs will\nnot meet professional standards.\nIn addition, the 3-hour orientation which direct care staff\nreceive in behavior management is totally inadequate.  Not only\nk\nis three hours insufficient to teach basic behavioral skills and\ntheory, it sends the wrong signal to staff who receive a full ten\nhours of instruction in how to restrain clients.  Inasmuch as\nthis structure suggests to personnel that restraint is more\nimportant than active programming in the area of life skills, it\njeopardizes the adequacy of resident care and poses an\nunreasonable risk to their freedom from bodily restraint.\nIII.  Inadequate Psychiatric Care\nThe prescription and monitoring of psychotropic medications\nat Boswell represent significant departures from accepted medical\npractice and fail to protect residents from serious risks of\nharm.\nOur consultants concluded that drugs were often randoir.ly\ngiven, with no rationale offered to justify their prescription.\nIn several instances, individuals were taken off one psychotropic\nโขmedication and placed on another without proper documentation to\njustify the change in prescription.\n\n- 4 -\nOnce a resident is placed on psychotropics, there is no\nsystematic monitoring of the side-effects of the medication by\nqualified staff-  Moreover, the direct care staff, who spend the\nmost time with residents and would therefore be the first to\nnotice side effects, receive no training whatsoever in this area\nand do not take part in the monitoring process.  There is, in\naddition, no systematic, facility-wide procedure to ensure that\neach resident's medication is evaluated on a timely basis.\nWhile medication dosage levels do not appear to present a\nproblem, our consultants found evidence of improper\npolypha-rmacological practices at Boswell.  Of particular concern\nwas the inattention paid-to the use of anticholinergics and the\nheavy use of inter-class polypharmacy.\nFinally, while it appears that some effort is being made to\nreduce the medication of certain residents, there is no policy in\nplace providing for regular trial withdrawals and drug holidays\nfor all residents.  This omission contravenes standards of\nprofessional clinical practice.\nIV. Inadequate Recordkeeping\nBoswell lacks a data gathering system sufficient to provide\ninformation upon which professional decisions may be based\nregarding all aspects of training programs for residents.\nThe ability of Boswell to deliver adequate care to its\nresidents is hindered by the inadequate recordkeeping practices\nat the facility.  A resident's diagnosis and the reasons for\nprescribing certain procedures and medications are seldom written\ninto a resident's record.  When changes a^e made, there is little\nindication in the record -as to the basis for such a change.\nWithout this information, professional care and treatment\ndecisions cannot be made.\nBoswell's practice of keeping medical and training records\nseparately poses a risk to resident safety.  Keeping medical\nrecords in a central location where they are not readily\naccessible to direct care staff is potentially dangerous in that\nit renders staff unable to check drug data when necessary.  In\naddition, without the benefit of a comprehensive record, it is\ndifficult to assess the interaction of drugs and behavioral\ninterventions which is necessary in evaluating treatment effects.\nV. Inadequate Physical Environment\nBoswell's physical environment is grossly out-of-date,\nhaving been originally designed to serve as a tuberculosis\nhospital, and contravenes health and safety standards.\n\n\n\nBoswell's physical environment threatens the safety of\nresidents.  For example, sharp metal pieces were observed .\nprotruding from the walls of many rooms.  These fixtures, part of\nintercom and heating/air systems which are no longer functional,\nare dangerous to residents.  Similarly, rubber gloves found lying\non a bathroom floor and window ledge are cause for concern in\nlight of the presence of patients with pica behavior, i.e.,\ningesting foreign objects.  These same residents are also at risk\nof ingesting used paper towels, soda pop lids and metal coat\nhangers which were also discovered on the wards within their\nreach.\nThe facility also suffers from a general state of disrepair\nand lack of adequate sanitation.  For example, curtains and\ncurtain rods were observed to be missing in some of the\n'residential living areas, and bathroom fixtures such as soap\ndispensers and faucets did not always function properly.  Some of\nthe floors and toilet areas were also in serious need of\ncleaning, as was illustrated by the foul odor emanating from\ncertain bathrooms.  These conditions present an unreasonable risk\nto the health and safety of residents.\nVI. Minimal Remedial Measures\nThe aforementioned conditions result in the deprivation of\nBoswell residents' constitutional rights.  To rectify the\nconditions at Boswell and to ensure that constitutionally\nadequate conditions are established there, we propose to enter\ninto a legally binding and judicially enforceable agreement with\nthe State of Mississippi providing, at a minimum, for the\nfollowing remedies:\n1. Boswell must provide conditions or confinement that\nprotect residents from undue risks to personal safety;\n2. Medication practices must be modified to ensure that they\ncomport with accepted professional medical standards;\n3. Training programs must be professionally designed for\nthose residents for whom such training can reduce or eliminate\nunreasonable risks to their personal safety and/or the use of\nundue bodily restraint.  Residents with self-injurious,\nphysically abusive or other destructive behaviors must be\nidentified immediately and provided training to reduce or\neliminate such behaviors;\n4. Boswell must hire and employ a sufficient number of\nqualified professional staff to provide residents with minimally\nadequate training, as described in paragraph 3 above;\n\n- 6 -\n5- Staff must receive instruction in behavior therapy and\nmethodology sufficient to provide Boswell's residents with\nminimally adequate training, as described in paragraph 3 above;\n6. Recordkeeping and administrative practices must be\nimplemented to ensure that residents' treatment and training are\nbased on or consistent with judgments of qualified professionals.\nInformation about federal financial assistance which ray be\navailable to assist with the remediation process can be obtained\nthrough the United States Department of Health and Human\nServices' Regional Office (Director, Intergovernmental and\nCongressional Affairs, 404-221-2227) and through the United\nStates Department of Education.\nOur attorneys will be contacting your Attorney General's\nOffice shortly to arrange for a meeting to discuss this matter in\ngreater detail.  We seek to resolve these matters in a reasonable\nmanner and in the spirit of cooperation most ably demonstrated in\nour recent negotiations with respect to Ellisville State School.\nWe look forward to working with state officials toward a\nsimilarly satisfactory resolution of this matter.\nSincerely,\nยซ-<*ยซ\"\nJohn R.
