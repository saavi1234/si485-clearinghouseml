    "summary": "<p>This case challenged the state of Michigan's plans to bring a lawsuit against fossil fuel companies to hold them liable for their contribution to climate change and its effects.</p>\r\n<p>On April 30, 2025, the United States filed this lawsuit against Michigan, its Governor, and its Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The DOJ argued that Michigan's lawsuit was pre-empted by the Clean Air Act and the federal government's control over foreign affairs, that it would constitute unconstitutional regulation by a state of territory outside the state, and that it would violate the Interstate Commerce and Foreign Commerce Clauses. Specifically, the DOJ argued that through the Clean Air Act, the Congress anointed the federal EPA as the regulator of greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, under the Supremacy Clause, states were pre-empted from regulating greenhouse gas emissions through state law. The DOJ asked the court to declare that Michigan's state law claims were unconstitutional, and to permanently enjoin Michigan from taking actions to assert Michigan's state law claims.</p>\r\n<p>On June 20, 2025, Michigan moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it entrenched on state sovereignty and should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Michigan argued in the alternative that judicial review should be deferred until it could decide whether to file any of its claims under Michigan state law.</p>\r\n<p>On July 11, 2025, the United States filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint did not name any new parties, causes of action, or forms of requested relief. However, the amended complaint significantly expanded the United States' factual allegations regarding specific steps Michigan has taken toward litigation, including retention of private counsel and requests for proposals to sue fossil fuel companies. Since the amended complaint superseded the original complaint, the court dismissed Michigan's motion to dismiss as moot on July 15, 2025.</p>\r\n<p>On July 31, 2025, Michigan again moved to dismiss the case, arguing that the matter was not ripe, depriving the court of subject-matter jurisdiction. Michigan states that it has not filed any climate-related lawsuits against any fossil fuel industry entity. In addition, even if Michigan does file a climate-related suit in the future, it&rsquo;s unclear who will be sued, where the claims will be brought, and whether the claims will be based in federal or state law. Without specific claims before the court to assess, Michigan argues the court can&rsquo;t properly determine if the state action is preempted or unconstitutional.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>This case is ongoing.</p>",

As a result, Michiganโs initial motion was dismissed as moot.

The United States is facing an energy crisis. Overly restrictive policies and \nregulation have caused inadequate development of Americaโs abundant energy resources. Yet \nโ[a]n affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic \nsecurity of the United States, as well as our foreign policy.โ Executive Order 14260, Protecting \nAmerican Energy From State Overreach ยง 1.  \n2.  As a result, on January 20, 2025, President Trump declared an energy emergency, \nconcluding that the United Statesโ โinsufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and \ngeneration constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nationโs economy, national \nsecurity, and foreign policy.โ Executive Order 14156 ยง 1, Declaring a National Energy \nEmergency.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.2     Filed 04/30/25     Page 2 of 22\n \n3.  As a result of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the American \npeople are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to defend itself from hostile \nforeign actors. Id. \n4.  Michigan intends to sue fossil fuel companies to seek damages for alleged climate \nchange harms. See Scott McClallen, Michigan To Wage War on Oil and Gas Companies, \nMichigan Capitol Confidential (Oct. 14, 2024), \nhttps://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/news/michigan-to-wage-war-on-oil-and-gas-\ncompanies. At a time when States should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable \nsources of domestic energy, Michigan is choosing to stand in the way. This Nationโs Constitution \nand laws do not tolerate this interference. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1345. \n6.  This Court has authority to provide the relief requested under the U.S. \nConstitution, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1651, 2201, and 2202, and its inherent legal and equitable powers. \n7.  The United States has standing to vindicate its sovereign, proprietary, and parens \npatriae interests. E.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012). The United Statesโ \nsovereign interests include ensuring that States do not interfere with federal law, including the \nClean Air Act, or with the federal governmentโs exclusive authority over interstate and foreign \ncommerce, greenhouse gas regulation, and national energy policy. The United Statesโ proprietary \ninterests include its economic interests in revenue from fossil fuel leasing on federal lands, which \ngenerated over $13.8 billion in 2024,1 and its costs for purchasing fossil fuels, which will \n \n1 The Department of the Interior manages land owned by the United States. The Department \nissues leases to produce fossil fuels from federal lands and for production in areas of the Outer \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.3     Filed 04/30/25     Page 3 of 22\n \nincrease if Michigan and other states seek damages from fossil fuel companies. See City of New \nYork v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 103 (2d Cir. 2021) (observing that holding fossil fuel \nproducers โaccountable for purely foreign activity (especially the Foreign Producers) would \nrequire them to internalize the costs of climate change and would presumably affect the price and \nproduction of fossil fuels abroad.โ). Additionally, the United States has parens patriae standing to \nprotect the economic well-being of its citizens and the national energy market from Michiganโs \nattempts to impose extraterritorial and excessive burdens on fossil fuel companies, which will \nraise energy costs for consumers nationwide and disrupt the uniform regulation of fossil fuel \nproduction. These harms affect a substantial segment of the population, and individual litigants, \nsuch as fossil fuel businesses, cannot fully address the nationwide economic and constitutional \ninjuries caused by Michiganโs overreach. \n8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they reside in, or \nconduct a substantial portion of their official business in, Michigan. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1). \n9.  Venue is proper in the Western District of Michigan pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1391, because at least one Defendant resides in the District and because a substantial part of \nthe acts giving rise to this suit occurred within the District. \nPARTIES \n \n10.  Plaintiff is the United States of America, suing on its own behalf, on behalf of its \ncitizens, and on behalf of its executive departments and other subdivisions. \n11.  Defendant State of Michigan is a State of the United States. \n \nContinental Shelf. Each year, the Department collects substantial revenue from those onshore \nand offshore leases. In 2024, the Department collected revenue of more than $490 million for \ncoal, $950 million for gas, and $12.4 billion for oil.

Defendant Gretchen Whitmer is the Governor of the State of Michigan. She is \nsued in her official capacity. \n13.  Defendant Dana Nessel is the Attorney General of the State of Michigan. She is \nsued in her official capacity. \nALLEGATIONS AND APPLICABLE LAW \n \nMichiganโs Climate Change Claims \n \n14.  Michigan has announced its intent to file litigation seeking to hold fossil fuel \ncompanies liable for purported contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. See Scott McClallen, \nMichigan To Wage War on Oil and Gas Companies, Michigan Capitol Confidential (Oct. 14, \n2024), https://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/news/michigan-to-wage-war-on-oil-and-\ngas-companies. The specific theories on which Michigan would sue are known only to Michigan, \nbut the goal of the lawsuit is clearโto extract large sums of money from fossil fuel companies \nfor purportedly causing climate change impacts to Michigan. See id. \nThe Clean Air Act Comprehensively Regulates Nationwide Air Pollution \n \n15.  The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401 et seq., creates a comprehensive program for \nregulating air pollution in the United States and โdisplacesโ the ability of States to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders. City of New York, 993 F.3d at 96. The Act \nimproves the Nationโs air quality by delegating authority to EPA to prescribe national standards \nfor air pollutants, which States then implement. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411. \n16.  In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court concluded that \ngreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are within the Clean Air Actโs \nunambiguous definition of โair pollutant,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 7602(g). Id. at 528-529. Thus, the Clean \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.5     Filed 04/30/25     Page 5 of 22\n \nAir Act delegates to EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases. See Am. \nElectric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut (AEP), 564 U.S. 410, 424-429 (2011). \n17.  For in-state stationary sources, the Clean Air Act generally preserves the ability of \nStates to adopt and enforce air pollution control requirements and limitations on in-state sources, \nso long as those are at least as stringent as the corresponding federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. \nยง 7416. For out-of-state sources, however, the โAct gives states a much more limited role,โ even \nif the pollution from those sources causes harm within their borders.

Regulating these emissions โimplicatesโ not only \nโthe conflicting rights of statesโ but also โour relations with foreign nations.โ Id. at 92.  \n19.  Consistent with the Constitutionโs allocation of supremacy in the field of foreign \npolicy to the federal government, see Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 62 (1941), the federal \ngovernment has demonstrated an active and continuous interest in reconciling protection of the \nenvironment, promotion of economic growth, and maintenance of national security when \nregulating greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels, see City of New York, 993 F.3d at 93 \n(recognizing responsibility of federal government in striking the right โbalanceโ in promoting \nthese goals). The federal government has been actively exercising its authority here and has been \ncontinually evaluating national interests as is its responsibility under the Constitution. It has โin \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.6     Filed 04/30/25     Page 6 of 22\n \nfact . . . addressedโ these interwoven issues on many occasions. Am. Ins. Assโn v. Garamendi, \n539 U.S. 396, 421 (2003). \n20.  In 1987, Congress enacted the Global Climate Protection Act. See Pub. L. No. \n100-204, Title XI, ยงยง 1101โ1106, 101 Stat. 1331, 1407โ09 (1987), reprinted as note to 15 U.S.C. \nยง 2901. Among its other goals, the Protection Act provided that the United States should โwork \ntoward multilateral agreementsโ on the issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Id. ยง 1103(a)(4), 101 \nStat. at 1408. It assigned to the President and EPA the responsibility for devising a โcoordinated \nnational policy on global climate change.โ Id. ยง 1103(b), 101 Stat. at 1408. And the Protection \nAct assigned to the President and the Secretary of State the responsibility for coordination of \nclimate change policy โin the international arena.โ Id. ยง 1103(c), 101 Stat. at 1409. \n21.  In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed, and the Senate unanimously \napproved, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, May 9, 1992, S. \nTreaty Doc. No. 102-38, 1771 U.N.T.S. 107 (entered into force Mar. 21, 1994), which has as its \nโultimate objective . . . stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a \nlevel that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.โ Id., \nArt. 2. \n22.  Under the Framework Convention, โ[a]ll Parties,โ including the United States, \nโshall . . . .  (b) [f]ormulate, implement, publish and regularly update national and, where \nappropriate, regional programmes containing measures to mitigate climate change by addressing \nanthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled \nby the Montreal Protocol, and measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change [and] \n(c) [p]romote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including transfer, of \ntechnologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent anthropogenic emissions of \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.7     Filed 04/30/25     Page 7 of 22\n \ngreenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol in all relevant sectors . . . .โ Id., Art. \n4.1(b), (c). \n23.  The Framework Convention does not set binding limits on greenhouse gas \nemissions for individual countries. It contains no enforcement mechanism. Instead, it includes \ngeneral obligations addressing climate change and creates a framework for cooperation by its \nparties. Among other things, it contemplates the possibility of its parties negotiating โprotocolsโ \nor other specific international agreements in pursuit of its objective. \n24.  Since approving the Framework Convention, the United States has engaged in \ninternational efforts regarding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, balancing foreign \npolicy considerations and domestic energy needs. In particular, the United States is also a party \nto the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. See Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Oct. 15, 2016, S. Treaty Doc. No. 117-1, \nC.N.730.2017. The Amendment commits the United States and other signatory countries to \nphase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas. The \nSenate ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2022, but only after Congress enacted the American \nInnovation and Manufacturing Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7675 in 2020, giving EPA authority under the \nClean Air Act to reduce production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. \n25.  By contrast, the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which \nprovided for greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on UNFCCC Annex I parties, including \nthe United States. Though the United States signed the protocol, President Clinton never \nsubmitted it to the Senate for ratification. Instead, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution \nexpressing disapproval of any protocol or other agreement that provides for disparate treatment \nof economically developing countries. S. Res. 98, 105th Cong. (1997).  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.8     Filed 04/30/25     Page 8 of 22\n \n26.  The United States is similarly not a party to the December 12, 2015 Paris Climate \nAccord (the Paris Agreement). Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, Dec. 13, 2015, in Rep. of the Conference of the Parties on the Twenty-First \nSession, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, annex (2016). In September 2016, President \nObama signed the Paris Agreement but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. On March \n28, 2017, President Trump described how the United States would seek to reconcile the Nationโs \nenvironmental, economic, and strategic concerns. See Exec. Order 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093 \n(Mar. 28, 2017). On November 4, 2019, the United States deposited a notification of withdrawal \nfrom the Paris Agreement. Although on February 19, 2021, President Biden announced that he \nrejoined this expensive and destructive protocol, on February 13, 2025, President Trump \nwithdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement. See Executive Order 14162, Putting \nAmerica First in International Agreements ยง 3(a). The President explained that โ[i]t is the policy \nof my Administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in \nthe development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or \nstifle the American economyโ and that such agreements โmust not unduly or unfairly burden the \nUnited States.โ Id. ยง 2. In other words, the President would put the interests of the American \npeople first in negotiating the terms of any future treaty to implement the Framework Convention \n27.  More recently, on April 2, 2025, President Trump invoked his authority under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to strengthen our Nationโs international \neconomic position by imposing reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. See Executive Order \n14257, Regulating Imports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute \nto Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits. The Executive Order \nspecifically exempts โenergy and energy productsโ from the tariffs.

The Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution provides that โ[t]his \nConstitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof . . . \nshall be the supreme Law of the Land . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to \nthe Contrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2.  \n30.  A state law is preempted under the Supremacy Clause when it intrudes into a field \nexclusively occupied by federal law (field preemption) or when it conflicts with federal law by \nstanding as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congressโs objectives (conflict preemption). \nSee City of Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 316-17 (1981) (field preemption); Hillsborough \nCounty v. Automated Medical Labs., Inc., 471 U.S. 707, 713 (1985) (conflict preemption). \n31.  Michiganโs state law claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. \nยงยง 7401 et seq., because they impermissibly regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and \nobstruct the Clean Air Actโs comprehensive federal-state framework and EPAโs regulatory \ndiscretion, see, e.g., Intโl Paper Co. v. Ouellette, 479 U.S. 481, 500 (1987) (โThe [Clean Water] \nAct pre-empts state law to the extent that the state law is applied to an out-of-state point \nsource.โ); Arizona, 567 U.S. at 399-400 (discussing preemption). \n32.   โThe Clean Air Act is a comprehensive statutory scheme that anoints the EPA as \nthe โprimary regulator of [domestic] greenhouse gas emissions.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at \n99 (quoting AEP, 564 U.S. at 428).  \n33.  Congress delegated to EPA the authority to determine whether and how to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions, thereby displacing federal common law claims and \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.10     Filed 04/30/25     Page 10 of 22\n \noccupying the field of interstate air pollution regulation.

Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 317 (1981) (holding that the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Actโs comprehensive regulatory program displaced federal common law of nuisance, as \nCongress occupied the field of water pollution regulation). \n34.  The Clean Air Actโs comprehensive framework, which includes specific \nprovisions for regulating emissions from stationary and mobile sources (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \nยงยง 7410, 7411, 7521), preempts state attempts to regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions. \nSee City of New York, 993 F.3d at 90-100. Michiganโs claims seeking to hold fossil fuel \nbusinesses liable for global greenhouse gas emissions usurp this federal authority. Michiganโs \nattempt to make fossil fuel companies pay for greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, most of \nwhich occur outside Michiganโs borders, is the type of state regulation of out-of-state interstate \ngreenhouse gas emissions preempted by the Clean Air Act. See Scott McClallen, Michigan To \nWage War on Oil and Gas Companies, Michigan Capitol Confidential (Oct. 14, 2024), \nhttps://www.michigancapitolconfidential.com/news/michigan-to-wage-war-on-oil-and-gas-\ncompanies. \n35.  Michiganโs state law claims conflict with the Clean Air Actโs purposes and \nobjectives by undermining its carefully calibrated cooperative federalism scheme and EPAโs \ndiscretion in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. \n36.  The Clean Air Act establishes a structured partnership between the federal \ngovernment and States, allowing States to regulate in-state stationary sources under specific \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.11     Filed 04/30/25     Page 11 of 22\n \nconditions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7401(a)(3), 7410(a)(2)(C), 7411(d), 7416, but limiting their \nrole in regulating out-of-state or global emissions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7410(a)(2)(C), \n7410(k)(5), 7475(a)(2), 7607(b). And the Clean Air Act contains a citizen-suit savings clause. 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 7604(e). When read together, the Clean Air Act โplainly permit[s] [S]tates to create and \nenforce their own emissions standards applicable to in-state polluters.โ City of New York, 993 \nF.3d at 99. This role โno doubt holds true for both state legislation and common law claims \nunder state law.โ Id. at 100 (citing Merrick v. Diageo Americas Supply, Inc., 805 F.3d 685, 690-\n91 (6th Cir. 2015)). โBut that authorization is narrowly circumscribed, and has been interpreted \nto permit only state lawsuits brought under โthe law of the [pollutionโs] source [s]tate.โโ Id. \n(citations omitted). \n37.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit โdoes not seek to take advantage of this slim \nreservoir of state common law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 99. Rather, the Stateโs suit \ninterferes with the Clean Air Actโs balance by effectively regulating out-of-state emissions. This \nextraterritorial regulation creates a patchwork of state-level penalties that undermines state \nauthority over pollution sources within state borders and frustrates the Clean Air Actโs goal of \nefficiency and predictability in the permit system. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 496; see also AEP, \n564 U.S. at 426 (holding that the Clean Air Actโs delegation to the EPA to regulate greenhouse \ngas emissions displaces federal common law, reflecting federal primacy). Such state \nencroachment on federal authority is preempted, as it obstructs the Clean Air Actโs integrated \napproach to air pollution control. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 497; see also City of New York, 993 \nF.3d at 90-95. \n38.  Moreover, Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit obstructs EPAโs discretion to balance \nenvironmental, economic, and energy considerations in regulating greenhouse gases. The Clean \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.12     Filed 04/30/25     Page 12 of 22\n \nAir Act grants EPA broad authority to promulgate regulations based on its expert judgment, \nincluding whether to impose emissions standards for stationary sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411 \nand for mobile sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7521. By imposing retroactive liability for lawful \nconduct, Michigan would second-guess EPAโs regulatory choices and imposes penalties that \nCongress did not authorize. \n39.  Michiganโs state law claims would further undermine federal objectives by \nincreasing energy costs and disrupting the national energy market, contrary to the Clean Air \nActโs integration with national energy policy. As noted in Executive Order 14156 (ยถ 2), \ninsufficient energy production due to restrictive state policies threatens national security and \neconomic prosperity. By targeting major fossil fuel businesses, many of which operate on federal \nlands or supply federal agencies, Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit would raise costs for federal \noperations and consumers nationwide, obstructing the Clean Air Actโs goal of balancing \nenvironmental protection with economic growth. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401(b)(1) (CAAโs purpose \nincludes protecting air quality โto promote the public health and welfare and the productive \ncapacity of its populationโ). \n40.  If Michigan is permitted to pursue these sorts of state law claims, other States \ncould pursue similar claims, leading to a chaotic โpatchworkโ of regulations that undermine the \nnational interest in readily available and affordable energy and the governmentโs ability to \neffectively administer coherent national environmental policy and regulation of global pollution. \nCity of New York, 993 F.3d at 86. Such fragmentation would frustrate Congressโs intent for a \nunified federal approach to global air pollution. See Hines, 312 U.S. at 67 (state law preempted \nwhen it obstructs federal objectives). \n41.  Thus, Michiganโs state law claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act. \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.13     Filed 04/30/25     Page 13 of 22\n \nCOUNT II \nUnconstitutional Extraterritorial Regulation \n \n42.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n43.  The Constitutionโs structure and provisions, including the Due Process Clause, as \nwell as concepts of State sovereignty and federalism, prohibit a State from regulating \ntransactions, and imposing liability for conduct, occurring outside its borders. Michiganโs state \nlaw claims violate the Constitution by imposing extraterritorial liability for primarily out-of-state \nextraction and refining activities and out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions. Michiganโs \nanticipated lawsuit is irreconcilable with the Constitutionโs commitment of such matters to the \nfederal government and the relative rights and obligations of the federal government and the \nStates under the Constitution. \n44.  The United States has standing to assert this claim to protect its sovereign, \nproprietary, and parens patriae interests. Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit, which would seek \nextraterritorial liability, interferes with the federal governmentโs authority to regulate interstate \nand foreign commerce and greenhouse gas emissions, undermining national energy policy. The \nfinancial burdens of Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit on fossil fuel businesses increase the United \nStatesโ costs for purchasing fuels and threaten revenue from federal leasing. In its parens patriae \ncapacity, the United States seeks to protect citizens nationwide from higher energy costs and \neconomic disruption caused by Michiganโs anticipated overreach, which individual litigants \ncannot fully address due to the nationwide impact of Michiganโs state law claims. \n45.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: โ[N]or shall any \nState deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .โ U.S. \nConst. amend.

The fossil fuel businesses targeted by Michiganโs state law claims are \npersons under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.14     Filed 04/30/25     Page 14 of 22\n \n46.  The Constitutionโs structure and principles of due process mandate that while \nStates are sovereign within their borders, they cannot regulate conduct beyond their borders, \nsuch as by imposing liability for pollution from out-of-state sources. โThe concept of Due \nProcess constraints on a state legislatureโs ability to regulate subject matters and transactions \nbeyond the stateโs boundaries, while perhaps infrequently litigated in those terms, is not new.โ \nGerling Glob. Reinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Gallagher, 267 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (11th Cir. 2001) \n(discussing Due Process limits on legislative jurisdiction). Indeed, โ[t]o resolve disputes about \nthe reach of one Stateโs power,โ the Supreme Court โhas long consulted โฆ the Constitutionโs \nstructure and the principles of โsovereignty and comityโ it embraces,โ along with โthe Due \nProcess Clause.โ Natโl Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 376 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \n47.  It is a well-established โdue process principle that a state is without power to \nexercise โextra territorial jurisdiction,โ that is, to regulate and control activities wholly beyond its \nboundaries.โ  Watson v.

Michiganโs state law claims violate the Constitutionโs structure and principles of \ndue process by seeking to impose economic sanctions on fossil fuel businesses for economic \nactivities that occurred primarily in other States and around the world. \n51.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit would improperly seek to โimpose strict liability \nfor the damages caused by fossil fuel emissions no matter where in the world those emissions \nwere released (or who released them),โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 93, including activities in \nother States and in foreign countries with no connection to Michigan. โSuch a sprawlingโ scope \nโis simply beyond the limits of state law.โ Id. at 92. \n52.  Even if an entity has some contacts with Michigan, such as in-state sales or \noperations, Michiganโs effort to collect damages for out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions does \nnot arise from or relate to those contacts, violating the requirement that a Stateโs regulatory \nauthority be limited to conduct with a substantial nexus to the State. \n53.  Moreover, the global scope of Michiganโs state law claims inherently overreaches \nby seeking to regulate conduct far beyond Michiganโs territorial jurisdiction, contravening the \nDue Process Clauseโs territorial limitations on state sovereignty. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.16     Filed 04/30/25     Page 16 of 22\n \n54.  Thus, Michiganโs state law claims violate the Constitutionโs limits on \nextraterritorial legislation. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Interstate Commerce Clause \n \n55.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n56.  The Constitution gives Congress โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among \nthe several States.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n57.  State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce are unconstitutional, even \nin the absence of federal legislation regulating the activity in question. Oklahoma Tax Commโn v. \nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179 (1995). \n58.  Michiganโs state law claims discriminate against interstate commerce facially, in \npractical effect, and in purpose by targeting commercial activityโfossil fuel extraction and \nrefiningโthat occurs primarily if not exclusively in States other than Michigan, including Texas, \nNew Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. \n59.  Because Michiganโs state law claims discriminate against interstate commerce, \nstrict scrutiny applies, and its anticipated lawsuit can be pursued only if โit advances a legitimate \nlocal purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.โ \nNew Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988). \n60.  Upon information and belief, Michigan has no legitimate local public interest in \ndiscriminating against interstate commerce. \n61.  Moreover, even if Michiganโs state law claims did not facially discriminate \nagainst interstate commerce and did not have non-discriminatory alternatives, it would still \nviolate the Interstate Commerce Clause under the balancing test articulated in Pike v. Bruce \nChurch, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). Under Pike, a state law that regulates evenhandedly and \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.17     Filed 04/30/25     Page 17 of 22\n \nhas only incidental effects on interstate commerce is unconstitutional if the burden imposed on \ninterstate commerce is โclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.โ Id. \n62.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit would also impose substantial burdens on \ninterstate commerce. By targeting fossil fuel businesses for extraction and refining activities and \ngreenhouse gas emissions occurring primarily in other States and foreign countries, Michigan \nwould disrupt the national market for fossil fuels. Michiganโs request for damages would \nincrease energy costs for consumers and businesses nationwide, as these costs are passed through \nthe interstate energy market. The potential for other States to adopt similar laws creates a risk of \nregulatory fragmentation, undermining the uniform national energy market. \n63.  Michiganโs state law claims would impose a substantial and undue burden on \ninterstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits. \n64.  Thus, Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit would violate the Interstate Commerce \nClause. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Foreign Commerce Clause \n \n65.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n66.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2. \n67.  The Constitution gives Congress the โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations . . . .โ  U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.18     Filed 04/30/25     Page 18 of 22\n \n68.  The Foreign Commerce Clause has a negative application. Thus, for example, \nState laws that impose taxes on foreign commerce โwill not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if \nthe taxpayer demonstrates that the taxโ implicates one of the four concerns identified in \nComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). A State law imposing taxes is \nunconstitutional if it (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial nexus to the State; (2) is not \nfairly apportioned; (3) discriminates against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly related to \nthe services provided by the State. See Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. Of California, \n512 U.S. 298, 310-11 (1994) (citing Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279). โIn the unique context of \nforeign commerce, a Stateโs power is further constrained because of the special need for federal \nuniformity.โ Id. at 311 (cleaned up). Thus, โ[a] tax affecting foreign commerce therefore raises \ntwo concerns in addition to the four delineated in Complete Auto.โ Id. โThe first is prompted by \nthe enhanced risk of multiple taxation. The second relates to the Federal Governmentโs capacity \nto speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.โ Id. \n(cleaned up). \n69.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit is not a state tax. But the same limiting principles \nthat apply to a Stateโs power to impose taxes on foreign commerce also apply to a Stateโs power \nto impose penalties, fines, and other civil liability on foreign commerce. \n70.  Michiganโs state law claims discriminate against foreign commerce facially, in \npractical effect, and in purpose by imposing penalties or fines that directly and substantially \nburden foreign commerce. Michigan would seek to impose liability on fossil fuel businesses for \nactivitiesโextraction and refining of fossil fuelsโthat occurred โworldwideโ in foreign \ncountries. Michigan would seek to impose liability on these foreign activities even though they \nlack a substantial nexus to Michigan. Michigan also would discriminate against foreign \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.19     Filed 04/30/25     Page 19 of 22\n \ncommerce and imposes liability that is not fairly related to the services provided by the State. \nMichiganโs anticipated lawsuit would enhance the risk of multiple States imposing overlapping \nliability on foreign commerce for the same activities. And it would harm the federal \ngovernmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when conducting commercial relations with \nforeign governments on issues such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, \nexports and imports of fossil fuels, and national security.  \n71.  The United States does not challenge Michiganโs authority to regulate the local \nactivities of international corporations, such as emissions from in-state facilities or taxes on in-\nstate sales. Ordinary state regulations that incidentally affect foreign commerce without such \nextraterritorial scope or federal interference remain permissible under the Foreign Commerce \nClause. But Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit does not fall within this permissible role for States. \nRather, Michiganโs attempt to expropriate funds from worldwide extraction and refining with \nminimal nexus to Michigan, imposes a disproportionate burden on foreign commerce, and \nundermine the federal governmentโs ability to maintain uniformity in regulating environmental, \ntrade, and national security policy. \n72.  Thus, Michiganโs state law claims violate the Foreign Commerce Clause. \nCOUNT V \nForeign Affairs Preemption \n \n73.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n74.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.20     Filed 04/30/25     Page 20 of 22\n \n75.  Even aside from his military powers as the โCommander in Chief of the Army \nand Navy,โ U.S. Const. art. II, ยง 2, cl. 1, the Constitutions vests broad responsibility for the \nconduct of foreign affairs in the President of the United States. \n76.  The President has โPower, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to \nmake Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.โ Id., art. II, ยง 2, cl. 2. \n77.  The President โnominate[s], and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, . . . appoint[s] Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.โ Id. \n78.  The President โreceive[s] Ambassadors and other public Ministers.โ Id., art. II, \nยง 3. \n79.  The Constitution authorizes the President to โtake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.โ Id. \n80.  In short, โthe supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign \naffairs . . . is made clear by the Constitution.โ Hines, 312 U.S. at 62. \n81.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the provisions of the Constitution that vest \nauthority over foreign affairs in the President to prohibit actions by the States that lie outside \ntheir traditional and localized areas of responsibility and instead interfere with the federal \ngovernmentโs foreign policy, or otherwise has more than an incidental effect in conflict with \nexpress foreign policy. See Garamendi, 539 U.S. at 418-20. \n82.  Michiganโs state law claims fall outside the area of any traditional state interest. \nThey instead regulate โa uniquely international problemโ that is โnot well-suited to the \napplication of state law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85-86. \n83.  By adopting the Framework Convention, the federal government undertook to \nformulate foreign policy with respect to the โstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.21     Filed 04/30/25     Page 21 of 22\n \nthe atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the \nclimate system.โ  Framework Convention, Art. 2. \n84.  By attempting to impose liability based on greenhouse gas emissions purportedly \nattributable to worldwide fossil fuel extraction and refining, Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit could \nundermine the ability of the United States to speak with one voice on a matter of pressing \ninterest around the globe. Michiganโs state law claims also could complicate the United Statesโ \nrelations with foreign countries concerning regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, \nand exports and imports of fossil fuels. And Michiganโs state law claims penalize extraction and \nrefining activities in foreign countries despite the Presidentโs explicit judgment that energy \nimports should be exempt from the tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257. \n85.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit interferes with the United Statesโ foreign policy on \ngreenhouse gas regulation, including but not limited to the United Statesโ participation in the \nFramework Convention and announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris \nAgreement, and is therefore preempted. \n86.  This claim does not challenge Michiganโs authority to enact local regulations that \nincidentally affect international corporations, such as environmental standards for in-state \noperations. Instead, the United States seeks to prevent Michigan from pursuing its state law \nclaims because its imposition of liability for worldwide greenhouse gas emissions directly \nintrudes on the federal governmentโs exclusive authority over foreign affairs, including the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and trade policy. This extraordinary \nextraterritorial reach and conflict with federal foreign policy distinguish Michiganโs state law \nclaims from ordinary state regulations that do not undermine the United Statesโ ability to speak \nwith one voice in international relations. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496     ECF No. 1,  PageID.22     Filed 04/30/25     Page 22 of 22\n \n87.  Simply put, Michiganโs attempt โto recover damages for the harms caused by \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions mayโ not โproceed under [Michigan] law.โ City of New York, \n993 F.3d at 91. \n88.  Thus, Michiganโs state law claims are preempted by the foreign affairs doctrine. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.  Declare Michiganโs state law claims unconstitutional under 28 U.S.C. ยง 2201; \nB.  Permanently enjoin Defendants from taking actions to assert Michiganโs state law \nclaims; \nC.

The United States is facing an energy crisis. Overly restrictive policies and \nregulation have caused inadequate development of Americaโs abundant energy resources. Yet \nโ[a]n affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic \nsecurity of the United States, as well as our foreign policy.โ Executive Order 14260, Protecting \nAmerican Energy From State Overreach ยง 1.  \n2.  On January 20, 2025, President Trump declared an energy emergency, concluding \nthat the United Statesโ โinsufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and generation \nconstitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nationโs economy, national security, and \nforeign policy.โ Executive Order 14156 ยง 1, Declaring a National Energy Emergency.  \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.66     Filed 07/11/25     Page 2 of 66\n \n3.  As a result of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the American \npeople are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to defend itself from hostile \nforeign actors. Id. \n4.  Not satisfied with its legitimate regulatory options, Michigan intends to sue fossil \nfuel companies to seek damages for alleged climate change harms. See infra ยถยถ 14โ28. At a time \nwhen States should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic \nenergy for its residents, Michigan is choosing to stand in the way. This Nationโs Constitution and \nlaws do not tolerate this interference. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1345. \n6.  This Court has authority to provide the relief requested under the U.S. \nConstitution, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1651, 2201, and 2202, and its inherent legal and equitable powers. \n7.  The United States has standing to vindicate its sovereign, proprietary, and parens \npatriae interests. E.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012). The United Statesโ \nsovereign interests include ensuring that States do not interfere with federal law, including the \nClean Air Act, or with the federal governmentโs exclusive authority over interstate and foreign \ncommerce, greenhouse gas regulation, and national energy policy. The United Statesโ proprietary \ninterests include its economic interests in revenue from fossil fuel leasing on federal lands, which \ngenerated over $13.8 billion in 2024,1 and its costs for purchasing fossil fuels, which will \n \n1 The Department of the Interior manages land owned by the United States. The Department \nissues leases to produce fossil fuels from federal lands and for production in areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Each year, the Department collects substantial revenue from those onshore \nand offshore leases. In 2024, the Department collected revenue of more than $490 million for \ncoal, $950 million for gas, and $12.4 billion for oil. U.S. DEPโT OF THE INTERIOR, \nNATURAL RESOURCES REVENUE DATA, https://revenuedata.doi.gov/ (last visited Apr. 30, \n2025). \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.67     Filed 07/11/25     Page 3 of 66\n \nincrease if Michigan and other states seek damages from fossil fuel companies. See City of New \nYork v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 103 (2d Cir. 2021) (observing that holding fossil fuel \nproducers โaccountable for purely foreign activity (especially the Foreign Producers) would \nrequire them to internalize the costs of climate change and would presumably affect the price and \nproduction of fossil fuels abroad.โ). Additionally, the United States has parens patriae standing to \nprotect the economic well-being of its citizens and the national energy market from Michiganโs \nplanned efforts to impose extraterritorial and excessive burdens on fossil fuel companies, which \nwill raise energy costs for consumers nationwide and disrupt the uniform regulation of fossil fuel \nproduction. These harms affect a substantial segment of the population, and individual litigants, \nsuch as fossil fuel businesses, cannot fully address the nationwide economic and constitutional \ninjuries caused by Michiganโs overreach. \n8.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they reside in, or \nconduct a substantial portion of their official business in, Michigan. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1). \n9.  Venue is proper in the Western District of Michigan pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1391, because at least one Defendant resides in the District and because a substantial part of \nthe acts giving rise to this suit occurred within the District. \nPARTIES \n \n10.  Plaintiff is the United States of America, suing on its own behalf, on behalf of its \ncitizens, and on behalf of its executive departments and other subdivisions. \n11.  Defendant State of Michigan is a State of the United States. \n12.  Defendant Gretchen Whitmer is the Governor of the State of Michigan. She is \nsued in her official capacity. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.68     Filed 07/11/25     Page 4 of 66\n \n13.  Defendant Dana Nessel is the Attorney General of the State of Michigan. She is \nsued in her official capacity. \nALLEGATIONS AND APPLICABLE LAW \n \nMichiganโs Threatened and Forthcoming Climate Change Claims \n \n14.  Michigan plans to file litigation seeking to hold fossil fuel companies liable for \npurported contributions to greenhouse gas emissions, as its Attorney General has made clear both \nby word and deed. Michigan has even entered a contract with three law firms to file that \nlitigation and appointed attorneys at those firms to be Special Assistant Attorneys General to \nlitigate the case. \n15.  On or about May 9, 2024, Defendant Nessel (Michiganโs Attorney General) \nissued a request for proposals from private attorneys and law firms โto pursue litigation related to \nthe climate change impacts caused by the fossil fuel industry on behalf of the State of Michigan.โ \nEx. 1, AG Nessel Requests Proposals from Attorneys to Pursue Litigation Against Fossil Fuel \nIndustry for Climate Impact, Mich. Depโt of Attโy Gen. (May 9, 2024), https://perma.cc/G6XU-\nCK58. \n16.  In issuing the request for proposals, Defendant Nessel said, โOur โPure Michiganโ \nidentity is under threat from the effects of climate change . . . . Pursuing this litigation [against \nthe fossil fuel industry] will allow us to recoup our costs and hold those responsible for \njeopardizing Michiganโs economic future and way of life accountable.โ Id. \n17.  Specifically, the request for proposals solicited โproposals from attorneys and law \nfirms to serve as Special Assistant Attorneys General (SAAGs) to pursue litigation related to the \nclimate change impacts caused by the fossil fuel industry on behalf of the State of Michigan \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.69     Filed 07/11/25     Page 5 of 66\n \nthrough the Department of Attorney General.โ Ex. 2, Climate Change, Mich. Depโt of Attโy \nGen., https://perma.cc/K3QL-Y59J. \n18.  The request for proposalsโ Statement of Work confirmed that Defendant Nessel \nsought โto pursue constitutional, statutory, tort and other applicable common-law claims \nextending to the deception and other wrongful actions by the fossil fuel industry to require the \nparties who profited from hiding the consequences of fossil fuel use to bear the costs of climate \nchange on Michigan.โ Ex. 3, Statement of Work (SOW), Mich. Depโt of Attโy Gen., \nhttps://perma.cc/45R5-NSXX. It further asserted, โThe fossil fuel industry has known for \ndecades that the use of fossil fuel products creates greenhouse gas pollution that warms the \nplanet and leads to climate change.โ Id. \n19.  The Statement of Work made clear Defendant Nesselโs intent to bring a lawsuit \nagainst fossil fuel companies: โThe work to be performed consists of assisting the [Department \nof Attorney General] in gathering needed information, determining what claims will be brought, \ndrafting the complaints (as appropriate), conducting affirmative and defensive discovery, taking \nand defending depositions, motion practice, and preparing for and conducting any trials that may \nproceed.โ Id. \n20.   On September 26, 2024, Defendant Nessel signed a contract to accomplish her \nplans to sue fossil fuel companies (the Litigation Contract). Ex. 4, SAAG Contract, State of \nMichigan Department of Attorney General, Climate Change Litigation, https://perma.cc/V5FX-\nBKEU. In the Contract, Defendant Nessel selected three law firms, DiCello Levitt LLP, Sher \nEdling LLP, and Hausfeld LLP, to provide legal services for โClimate Change litigation.โ Id. \nAnd Defendant Nessel appointed attorneys at those firms to be โSpecial Assistant Attorneys \nGeneralโ to pursue that litigation. Id. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.70     Filed 07/11/25     Page 6 of 66\n \n21.  That same day, Defendant Nessel also signed a contingent fee agreement with the \nsame three law firms, which was attached to the Litigation Contract. Ex. 5, Fee Agreement, State \nof Michigan Department of Attorney General, Climate Change Litigation, \nhttps://perma.cc/XS9J-BYLB. The fee agreement specifies what percentage of the recoveries the \nthree law firms would recover from the Climate Change litigation they agreed to pursue for \nMichigan. \n22.  Though Michigan has not yet filed its Climate Change litigation, it is no mystery \nwhat claims it is likely to assert. One of the law firms that Michigan has hired, Sher Edling, is a \nrepeat player that has repeatedly sued fossil fuel companies. On its website, Sher Edling lists \nmany cases that it has brought against fossil fuel companies, including lawsuits on behalf of \nseven states. See Sher Edling LLP, Climate Damage and Deception, https://perma.cc/MA84-\nTNVZ. Those complaints, which are available on the firmโs website, assert claims under the \nplaintiff stateโs statutes or common law. But state-law claims by a state seeking to hold fossil \nfuel companies liable for out-of-state emissions or conduct are preempted by federal law and are \notherwise unconstitutional for all the reasons set forth in this Complaint. \n23.  Even after the filing of this case by the United States, Defendant Nessel \nconfirmed that she will not be deterred from bringing her contemplated state-law claims against \nfossil fuel companies, saying, โThe DOJโs baseless lawsuit is a blatant attempt to intimidate my \noffice and deter us from holding Big Oil accountable.โ Ex. 6, AG Nessel Moves to Dismiss DOJ \nLawsuit Aimed at Blocking Potential Climate Action Against Fossil Fuel Industry, Mich. Depโt \nof Attโy Gen. (June 20, 2025), https://perma.cc/CAM4-ZTZC.  \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.71     Filed 07/11/25     Page 7 of 66\n \n24.  The imminent threat of Defendant Nessel following through on unconstitutional \nlitigation is neither new nor speculativeโshe has a history of taking litigating positions against \ngroups she openly disfavors.  \n25.  During her 2018 campaign, she disparagingly described those holding traditional \nreligious views on marriage and sexuality โas โhate-mongersโโ motivated by โdiscriminatory \nanimus.โ Buck v. Gorden, 429 F. Supp. 3d 447, 467 (W.D. Mich. 2019). Sure enough, once \nDefendant Nessel assumed office as Michiganโs Attorney General, she made good on her action \nagainst those of opposing worldviews. In pending litigation against a religious-adoption agency, \nDefendant Nessel changed the Stateโs position and opposed the agencyโs religious free-exercise \nin making child-placement decisions according to the agencyโs religious beliefsโdespite a \nMichigan statute specifically protecting such decisions. See id. at 457-58, 467. Defendant Nessel \nsought dismissal of a later religious-discrimination suit against her, saying that she was not a \nproper defendant because โshe is simply the Stateโs chief legal counsel [and] is not responsible \nfor Michiganโs change in policy.โ Id. at 467. The court found her assertion untenable, describing \nher as โa pivotal player in the Stateโs total reversal of positionโ in discrimination suits against \nreligious-adoption agencies and finding โa strong inference that [the plaintiff] was targeted based \non its religious belief, and that it was Defendant Nessel who targeted it.โ Id.; accord id. at 462 \n(โGeneral Nesselโs statements create a strong inference that the Stateโs real target is the religious \nbeliefs and confessions of [the plaintiff.]โ). In other words, Defendant Nessel could not have it \nboth ways. She could not openly malign religious free-exercise and then expect a court to turn a \nblind eye when her intentions regarding litigation were in focus. The same goes for assessing her \nstatements and actions against fossil fuel companies. \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.72     Filed 07/11/25     Page 8 of 66\n \n26.  And the risk that Michigan will sue fossil fuel companies is real and imminent, \nnot a mere speculative prospect. Not only has Defendant Nessel made her intentions known, she \nhas hired outside firms as Special Assistant Attorneys General to develop and prosecute that \nlitigation. See supra ยถยถ 14โ21. Hence, the lawsuit โis likely to come to pass.โ New Heights Farm \nI, LLC v. Great Am. Ins. Co., 119 F.4th 455, 460 (6th Cir. 2024). \n27.  This imminent prospect of Michiganโs litigation threatens a concrete injury to the \nsovereign interests of the United States. As alleged in greater detail below, the United States \nendures harm to its national energy policy so long as fossil fuel companies face a prospective \nchaotic patchwork of conflicting requirements from states and local governments. Regardless of \nthe exact theories of liability that Michigan employs, its goals are clearโto extract large sums of \nmoney from fossil fuel companies for purportedly causing climate change impacts to Michigan. \nSee Ex. 3 (explaining that โthe parties who profited from hiding the consequences of fossil fuel \nuse [should] bear the costs of climate change on Michiganโ).  \n28.  This imminent threat of litigation also undermines Congressโs intent in the Clean \nAir Act for a unified federal approach to global air pollution. See id. (noting the prudential \nconsideration of โhardshipโ to a party). And it undercuts the United Statesโ foreign policy on \ngreenhouse gas regulation and energy development. Thus, Michiganโs indisputable threat to \nbring claims against fossil fuel companies is creating a concrete injury. See Fischer v. Thomas, \n52 F.4th 303, 309 (6th Cir. 2022) (finding a claim ripe because an โongoing investigationโ that \ncould lead to an enforcement action had a present impact on affected partiesโ planning their \naffairs). \n29.  And the threats of enforcement via state-law litigation create an injury to the \nUnited Statesโ interestsโforcing fossil fuel companies to divert time, effort, and resources to \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.73     Filed 07/11/25     Page 9 of 66\n \npreparing for claims that are ultimately preempted. See id. This undermines the United Statesโ \nefforts to reduce state restrictions and burdens on energy production that are needlessly creating \na shortage of affordable energy. See supra ยถยถ 2โ3. \n30.  Hence, Michiganโs ongoing efforts to impose state law liability through the \nimminent threat of litigation create a tangible and present harm. Thus, this controversy is ripe, \nand the United States is entitled to the relief it seeks.2 \nThe Clean Air Act Comprehensively Regulates Nationwide Air Pollution \n \n31.  The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401 et seq., creates a comprehensive program for \nregulating air pollution in the United States and โdisplacesโ the ability of States to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders. City of New York, 993 F.3d at 96. The Act \nimproves the Nationโs air quality by delegating authority to EPA to prescribe national standards \nfor air pollutants, which States then implement. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411. \n32.  In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court concluded that \ngreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are within the Clean Air Actโs \nunambiguous definition of โair pollutant,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 7602(g). Id. at 528-529. Thus, the Clean \nAir Act delegates to EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases. See Am. \nElectric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut (AEP), 564 U.S. 410, 424-429 (2011). \n33.  For in-state stationary sources, the Clean Air Act generally preserves the ability of \nStates to adopt and enforce air pollution control requirements and limitations on in-state sources, \nso long as those are at least as stringent as the corresponding federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. \n \n2 Should Michigan desire to end this lawsuit, the United States would accept a stipulation from \nMichigan disavowing any intent to bring state-law claims against fossil fuel companies for \nalleged harms from greenhouse-gas emissions and terminating its Climate Change litigation \nefforts. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.74     Filed 07/11/25     Page 10 of 66\n \nยง 7416. For out-of-state sources, however, the โAct gives states a much more limited role,โ even \nif the pollution from those sources causes harm within their borders. City of New York, 993 F.3d \nat 88. Affected States can: (1) comment on proposed EPA rules and certain permits and plans, \nsee id. ยง 7607(d)(5), ยง 7475(a)(2), ยง 7410(a)(2)(C); 40 C.F.R. ยง 51.102(a); (2) seek judicial \nreview if their concerns are not addressed, see 42 U.S.C. ยง 7607(b); and (3) petition EPA in \ncertain instances, see id. ยง 7410(k)(5). \nThe United Statesโ Foreign Policy on \nGreenhouse Gas Regulation and Energy Development \n \n34.  Greenhouse gas emissions โpresent[] a uniquely international problem of national \nconcern.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85. Regulating these emissions โimplicatesโ not only \nโthe conflicting rights of statesโ but also โour relations with foreign nations.โ Id. at 92.  \n35.  Consistent with the Constitutionโs allocation of supremacy in the field of foreign \npolicy to the federal government, see Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 62 (1941), the federal \ngovernment has demonstrated an active and continuous interest in reconciling protection of the \nenvironment, promotion of economic growth, and maintenance of national security when \nregulating greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels, see City of New York, 993 F.3d at 93 \n(recognizing responsibility of federal government in striking the right โbalanceโ in promoting \nthese goals). The federal government has been actively exercising its authority here and has been \ncontinually evaluating national interests as is its responsibility under the Constitution. It has โin \nfact . . . addressedโ these interwoven issues on many occasions. Am. Ins. Assโn v. Garamendi, \n539 U.S. 396, 421 (2003). \n36.  In 1987, Congress enacted the Global Climate Protection Act. See Pub. L. No. \n100-204, Title XI, ยงยง 1101โ1106, 101 Stat. 1331, 1407โ09 (1987), reprinted as note to 15 U.S.C. \nยง 2901.

In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed, and the Senate unanimously \napproved, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, May 9, 1992, S. \nTreaty Doc. No. 102-38, 1771 U.N.T.S. 107 (entered into force Mar. 21, 1994), which has as its \nโultimate objective . . . stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a \nlevel that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.โ Id., \nArt. 2. \n38.  Under the Framework Convention, โ[a]ll Parties,โ including the United States, \nโshall . . . .

The Framework Convention does not set binding limits on greenhouse gas \nemissions for individual countries. It contains no enforcement mechanism. Instead, it includes \ngeneral obligations addressing climate change and creates a framework for cooperation by its \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.76     Filed 07/11/25     Page 12 of 66\n \nparties. Among other things, it contemplates the possibility of its partiesโ negotiating โprotocolsโ \nor other specific international agreements in pursuit of its objective. \n40.  Since approving the Framework Convention, the United States has engaged in \ninternational efforts regarding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, balancing foreign \npolicy considerations and domestic energy needs. In particular, the United States is also a party \nto the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. See Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Oct. 15, 2016, S. Treaty Doc. No. 117-1, \nC.N.730.2017. The Amendment commits the United States and other signatory countries to \nphase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas. The \nSenate ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2022, but only after Congress enacted the American \nInnovation and Manufacturing Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7675 in 2020, giving EPA authority under the \nClean Air Act to reduce production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. \n41.  By contrast, the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which \nprovided for greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on UNFCCC Annex I parties, including \nthe United States. Though the United States signed the protocol, President Clinton never \nsubmitted it to the Senate for ratification. Instead, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution \nexpressing disapproval of any protocol or other agreement that provides for disparate treatment \nof economically developing countries. S. Res. 98, 105th Cong. (1997).  \n42.  The United States is similarly not a party to the December 12, 2015 Paris Climate \nAccord (the Paris Agreement). Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, Dec. 13, 2015, in Rep. of the Conference of the Parties on the Twenty-First \nSession, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, annex (2016). In September 2016, President \nObama signed the Paris Agreement but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. On March \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.77     Filed 07/11/25     Page 13 of 66\n \n28, 2017, President Trump described how the United States would seek to reconcile the Nationโs \nenvironmental, economic, and strategic concerns. See Exec. Order 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093 \n(Mar. 28, 2017). On November 4, 2019, the United States deposited a notification of withdrawal \nfrom the Paris Agreement. Although on February 19, 2021, President Biden announced that he \nrejoined this expensive and destructive protocol, on February 13, 2025, President Trump \nwithdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement. See Executive Order 14162, Putting \nAmerica First in International Agreements ยง 3(a). The President explained that โ[i]t is the policy \nof my Administration to put the interests of the United States and the American people first in \nthe development and negotiation of any international agreements with the potential to damage or \nstifle the American economyโ and that such agreements โmust not unduly or unfairly burden the \nUnited States.โ Id. ยง 2. In other words, the President would put the interests of the American \npeople first in negotiating the terms of any future treaty to implement the Framework \nConvention. \n43.  More recently, on April 2, 2025, President Trump invoked his authority under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to strengthen our Nationโs international \neconomic position by imposing reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. See Executive Order \n14257, Regulating Imports with a Reciprocal Tariff to Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute \nto Large and Persistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits.

VI, cl. 2.  \n46.  A state law is preempted under the Supremacy Clause when it intrudes into a field \nexclusively occupied by federal law (field preemption) or when it conflicts with federal law by \nstanding as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congressโs objectives (conflict preemption). \nSee City of Milwaukee v.

Congress delegated to EPA the authority to determine whether and how to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions, thereby displacing federal common law claims and \noccupying the field of interstate air pollution regulation. See Massachusetts, 549 U.S. at 528-29 \n(holding that greenhouse gases are โair pollutantsโ under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7602(g)); AEP, 564 U.S. at \n426 (โThe critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to \nregulate carbon-dioxide emissions . . . the delegation displaces federal common law.โ); City of \nMilwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 317 (1981) (holding that the Federal Water Pollution \nControl Actโs comprehensive regulatory program displaced federal common law of nuisance, as \nCongress occupied the field of water pollution regulation). \n50.  The Clean Air Actโs comprehensive framework, which includes specific \nprovisions for regulating emissions from stationary and mobile sources (see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \nยงยง 7410, 7411, 7521), preempts state attempts to regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions. \nSee City of New York, 993 F.3d at 90-100. Michiganโs efforts to pursue state law claims holding \nfossil fuel businesses liable for global greenhouse gas emissions usurp this federal authority and \nimpose a present injury on the United States. See supra ยถยถ 25โ26. Michiganโs threatening to \nmake fossil fuel companies pay through state litigation for claimed effects of greenhouse gas \nemissions, see supra ยถยถ 14โ21, most of which occur worldwideโoutside Michiganโs borders, is \nthe type of state regulation of out-of-state interstate greenhouse gas emissions preempted by the \nClean Air Act.  \n51.  Michiganโs backdoor regulatory efforts conflict with the Clean Air Actโs purposes \nand objectives by undermining its carefully calibrated cooperative federalism scheme and EPAโs \ndiscretion in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.80     Filed 07/11/25     Page 16 of 66\n \n52.  The Clean Air Act establishes a structured partnership between the federal \ngovernment and States, allowing States to regulate in-state stationary sources under specific \nconditions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7401(a)(3), 7410(a)(2)(C), 7411(d), 7416, but limiting their \nrole in regulating out-of-state or global emissions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7410(a)(2)(C), \n7410(k)(5), 7475(a)(2), 7607(b). And the Clean Air Act contains a citizen-suit savings clause. 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 7604(e). When read together, the Clean Air Act โplainly permit[s] [S]tates to create and \nenforce their own emissions standards applicable to in-state polluters.โ City of New York, 993 \nF.3d at 99. This role โno doubt holds true for both state legislation and common law claims \nunder state law.โ Id. at 100 (citing Merrick v. Diageo Americas Supply, Inc., 805 F.3d 685, 690-\n91 (6th Cir. 2015)). โBut that authorization is narrowly circumscribed, and has been interpreted \nto permit only state lawsuits brought under โthe law of the [pollutionโs] source [s]tate.โโ Id. \n(citations omitted). \n53.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit โdoes not seek to take advantage of this slim \nreservoir of state common law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 99. Rather, the Stateโs actions \nthreaten to interfere with the Clean Air Actโs balance by effectively regulating out-of-state \nemissions. This extraterritorial regulation creates a patchwork of state-level penalties that \nundermines state authority over pollution sources within state borders and frustrates the Clean \nAir Actโs goal of efficiency and predictability in the permit system. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at \n496; see also AEP, 564 U.S. at 426 (holding that the Clean Air Actโs delegation to the EPA to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions displaces federal common law, reflecting federal primacy). \nSuch state encroachment on federal authority is preempted, as it obstructs the Clean Air Actโs \nintegrated approach to air pollution control. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 497; see also City of New \nYork, 993 F.3d at 90-95. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.81     Filed 07/11/25     Page 17 of 66\n \n54.  Moreover, Michiganโs actions obstruct EPAโs discretion to balance \nenvironmental, economic, and energy considerations in regulating greenhouse gases. The Clean \nAir Act grants EPA broad authority to promulgate regulations based on its expert judgment, \nincluding whether to impose emissions standards for stationary sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411 \nand for mobile sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7521. By imposing retroactive liability for lawful \nconduct, Michigan would second-guess EPAโs regulatory choices and imposes penalties that \nCongress did not authorize. \n55.  Michiganโs actions further undermine federal objectives by increasing energy \ncosts and disrupting the national energy market, contrary to the Clean Air Actโs integration with \nnational energy policy. As noted in Executive Order 14156 (ยถ 2), insufficient energy production \ndue to restrictive state policies threatens national security and economic prosperity. By targeting \nmajor fossil fuel businesses, many of which operate on federal lands or supply federal agencies, \nMichiganโs actions will raise costs for federal operations and consumers nationwide, obstructing \nthe Clean Air Actโs goal of balancing environmental protection with economic growth. See 42 \nU.S.C. ยง 7401(b)(1) (CAAโs purpose includes protecting air quality โto promote the public \nhealth and welfare and the productive capacity of its populationโ). \n56.  If Michigan is permitted to continue pursuing these sorts of state law claims, other \nStates could pursue similar claims, leading to a chaotic โpatchworkโ of regulations that \nundermine the national interest in readily available and affordable energy and the governmentโs \nability to effectively administer coherent national environmental policy and regulation of global \npollution. City of New York, 993 F.3d at 86. Such fragmentation would frustrate Congressโs \nintent for a unified federal approach to global air pollution. See Hines, 312 U.S. at 67 (state law \npreempted when it obstructs federal objectives). \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.82     Filed 07/11/25     Page 18 of 66\n \n57.  Thus, Michiganโs state law claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act. \nCOUNT II \nUnconstitutional Extraterritorial Regulation \n \n58.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n59.  The Constitutionโs structure and provisions, including the Due Process Clause, as \nwell as concepts of State sovereignty and federalism, prohibit a State from regulating \ntransactions, and imposing liability for conduct, occurring outside its borders. Michiganโs threats \nof state-law enforcement violate the Constitution by imposing extraterritorial liability for \nprimarily out-of-state extraction and refining activities and out-of-state greenhouse gas \nemissions. Any such lawsuit is irreconcilable with the Constitutionโs commitment of such \nmatters to the federal government and the relative rights and obligations of the federal \ngovernment and the States under the Constitution. \n60.  The United States has standing to assert this claim to protect its sovereign, \nproprietary, and parens patriae interests. Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit, which would seek \nextraterritorial liability, interferes with the federal governmentโs authority to regulate interstate \nand foreign commerce and greenhouse gas emissions, undermining national energy policy. The \nfinancial burdens of Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit on fossil fuel businesses increase the United \nStatesโ costs for purchasing fuels and threaten revenue from federal leasing. In its parens patriae \ncapacity, the United States seeks to protect citizens nationwide from higher energy costs and \neconomic disruption caused by Michiganโs overreach, which individual litigants cannot fully \naddress due to the nationwide impact of Michiganโs state law claims. \n61.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: โ[N]or shall any \nState deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .โ U.S. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.83     Filed 07/11/25     Page 19 of 66\n \nConst. amend. XIV, ยง 1. The fossil fuel businesses targeted by Michiganโs state law claims are \npersons under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n62.  The Constitutionโs structure and principles of due process mandate that while \nStates are sovereign within their borders, they cannot regulate conduct beyond their borders, \nsuch as by imposing liability for pollution from out-of-state sources. โThe concept of Due \nProcess constraints on a state legislatureโs ability to regulate subject matters and transactions \nbeyond the stateโs boundaries, while perhaps infrequently litigated in those terms, is not new.โ \nGerling Glob. Reinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Gallagher, 267 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (11th Cir. 2001) \n(discussing Due Process limits on legislative jurisdiction). Indeed, โ[t]o resolve disputes about \nthe reach of one Stateโs power,โ the Supreme Court โhas long consulted โฆ the Constitutionโs \nstructure and the principles of โsovereignty and comityโ it embraces,โ along with โthe Due \nProcess Clause.โ Natโl Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 376 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \n63.  It is a well-established โdue process principle that a state is without power to \nexercise โextra territorial jurisdiction,โ that is, to regulate and control activities wholly beyond its \nboundaries.โ  Watson v. Emps. Liab. Assur. Corp., 348 U.S. 66, 70 (1954) (citing Home Ins. Co. \nv.

Michiganโs efforts to regulate and impose liability for actions beyond its borders \nviolate the Constitutionโs structure and principles of due process by seeking to impose economic \nsanctions on fossil fuel businesses for economic activities that occurred primarily in other States \nand around the world. \n67.  Michigan improperly seeks to โimpose strict liability for the damages caused by \nfossil fuel emissions no matter where in the world those emissions were released (or who \nreleased them),โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 93, including activities in other States and in \nforeign countries with no connection to Michigan. โSuch a sprawlingโ scope โis simply beyond \nthe limits of state law.โ Id. at 92. \n68.  Even if an entity has some contacts with Michigan, such as in-state sales or \noperations, Michiganโs effort to collect damages for out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions does \nnot arise from or relate to those contacts, violating the requirement that a Stateโs regulatory \nauthority be limited to conduct with a substantial nexus to the State. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.85     Filed 07/11/25     Page 21 of 66\n \n69.  Moreover, the global scope predicating any state law claims by Michigan \ninherently overreaches by seeking to regulate conduct far beyond Michiganโs territorial \njurisdiction, contravening the Due Process Clauseโs territorial limitations on state sovereignty. \n70.  Thus, Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability on fossil fuel companies \nviolate the Constitutionโs limits on extraterritorial action. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Interstate Commerce Clause \n \n71.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n72.  The Constitution gives Congress โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among \nthe several States.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n73.  State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce are unconstitutional, even \nin the absence of federal legislation regulating the activity in question. Okla. Tax Commโn v. \nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179 (1995). \n74.  Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability discriminate against interstate \ncommerce facially, in practical effect, and in purpose by targeting commercial activityโfossil \nfuel extraction and refiningโthat occurs primarily if not exclusively in States other than \nMichigan, including Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, \nand North Dakota. \n75.  Because Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability discriminate against \ninterstate commerce, strict scrutiny applies, and its anticipated lawsuit can be pursued only if โit \nadvances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by reasonable \nnondiscriminatory alternatives.โ New Energy Co. of Indiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 \n(1988). \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.86     Filed 07/11/25     Page 22 of 66\n \n76.  Upon information and belief, Michigan has no legitimate local public interest in \ndiscriminating against interstate commerce. \n77.  Moreover, even if Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability did not facially \ndiscriminate against interstate commerce and did not have non-discriminatory alternatives, they \nwould still violate the Interstate Commerce Clause under the balancing test articulated in Pike v. \nBruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). Under Pike, a state law that regulates \nevenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce is unconstitutional if the \nburden imposed on interstate commerce is โclearly excessive in relation to the putative local \nbenefits.โ Id. \n78.  Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability also impose substantial burdens on \ninterstate commerce. By targeting fossil fuel businesses for extraction and refining activities and \ngreenhouse gas emissions occurring primarily in other States and foreign countries, Michigan is \ndisrupting the national market for fossil fuels. Michiganโs forcing fossil fuel companies to \nprepare for and defend against its claims will increase energy costs for consumers and businesses \nnationwide, as these costs are passed through the interstate energy market. Likewise, Michiganโs \nrequest for damages would further increase energy costs. The potential for other States to adopt \nsimilar approaches to regulating fossil fuel companies creates a risk of regulatory fragmentation, \nundermining the uniform national energy market. \n79.  Michiganโs state law claims would impose a substantial and undue burden on \ninterstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits. \n80.  Thus, Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability on fossil fuel companies \nviolate the Interstate Commerce Clause. \n \n \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.87     Filed 07/11/25     Page 23 of 66\n \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Foreign Commerce Clause \n \n81.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n82.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2. \n83.  The Constitution gives Congress the โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations . . . .โ  U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n84.  The Foreign Commerce Clause has a negative application. Thus, for example, \nState laws that impose taxes on foreign commerce โwill not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if \nthe taxpayer demonstrates that the taxโ implicates one of the four concerns identified in \nComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). A State law imposing taxes is \nunconstitutional if it (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial nexus to the State; (2) is not \nfairly apportioned; (3) discriminates against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly related to \nthe services provided by the State. See Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise Tax Bd. Of California, \n512 U.S. 298, 310-11 (1994) (citing Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279). โIn the unique context of \nforeign commerce, a Stateโs power is further constrained because of the special need for federal \nuniformity.โ Id. at 311 (cleaned up). Thus, โ[a] tax affecting foreign commerce therefore raises \ntwo concerns in addition to the four delineated in Complete Auto.โ Id. โThe first is prompted by \nthe enhanced risk of multiple taxation. The second relates to the Federal Governmentโs capacity \nto speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.โ Id. \n(cleaned up). \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.88     Filed 07/11/25     Page 24 of 66\n \n85.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit is not a state tax. But the same limiting principles \nthat apply to a Stateโs power to impose taxes on foreign commerce also apply to a Stateโs power \nto impose penalties, fines, and other civil liability on foreign commerce. \n86.  Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability discriminate against foreign \ncommerce facially, in practical effect, and in purpose by imposing penalties or fines that directly \nand substantially burden foreign commerce. Michigan would seek to impose liability on fossil \nfuel businesses for activitiesโextraction and refining of fossil fuelsโthat occurred โworldwideโ \nin foreign countries. Michigan would seek to impose liability on these foreign activities even \nthough they lack a substantial nexus to Michigan. Michigan also would discriminate against \nforeign commerce and imposes liability that is not fairly related to the services provided by the \nState. Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit would enhance the risk of multiple States imposing \noverlapping liability on foreign commerce for the same activities. And Michiganโs efforts harm \nthe federal governmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when conducting commercial \nrelations with foreign governments on issues such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, \ntrade policy, exports and imports of fossil fuels, and national security.  \n87.  The United States does not challenge Michiganโs authority to regulate the local \nactivities of international corporations, such as emissions from in-state facilities or taxes on in-\nstate sales. Ordinary state regulations that incidentally affect foreign commerce without such \nextraterritorial scope or federal interference remain permissible under the Foreign Commerce \nClause. But Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability do not fall within this permissible \nrole for States. Rather, Michiganโs attempt to expropriate funds from worldwide extraction and \nrefining with minimal nexus to Michigan, imposes a disproportionate burden on foreign \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.89     Filed 07/11/25     Page 25 of 66\n \ncommerce, and undermine the federal governmentโs ability to maintain uniformity in regulating \nenvironmental, trade, and national security policy. \n88.  Thus, Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability on fossil fuel companies \nviolate the Foreign Commerce Clause. \nCOUNT V \nForeign Affairs Preemption \n \n89.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n90.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \n91.  Even aside from his military powers as the โCommander in Chief of the Army \nand Navy,โ U.S. Const. art. II, ยง 2, cl. 1, the Constitutions vests broad responsibility for the \nconduct of foreign affairs in the President of the United States. \n92.  The President has โPower, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to \nmake Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.โ Id., art. II, ยง 2, cl. 2. \n93.  The President โnominate[s], and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, . . . appoint[s] Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.โ Id. \n94.  The President โreceive[s] Ambassadors and other public Ministers.โ Id., art. II, \nยง 3. \n95.  The Constitution authorizes the President to โtake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.โ Id. \n96.  In short, โthe supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign \naffairs . . . is made clear by the Constitution.โ Hines, 312 U.S. at 62. \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.90     Filed 07/11/25     Page 26 of 66\n \n97.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the provisions of the Constitution that vest \nauthority over foreign affairs in the President to prohibit actions by the States that lie outside \ntheir traditional and localized areas of responsibility and instead interfere with the federal \ngovernmentโs foreign policy, or otherwise has more than an incidental effect in conflict with \nexpress foreign policy. See Garamendi, 539 U.S. at 418-20. \n98.  Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability fall outside the area of any \ntraditional state interest. They instead regulate โa uniquely international problemโ that is โnot \nwell-suited to the application of state law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85-86. \n99.  By adopting the Framework Convention, the federal government undertook to \nformulate foreign policy with respect to the โstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the \nclimate system.โ  Framework Convention, Art. 2. \n100.  By attempting to impose liability based on greenhouse gas emissions purportedly \nattributable to worldwide fossil fuel extraction and refining, Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit could \nundermine the ability of the United States to speak with one voice on a matter of pressing \ninterest around the globe. Michiganโs ongoing efforts to impose state law liability also will \ncomplicate the United Statesโ relations with foreign countries concerning regulation of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, and exports and imports of fossil fuels. And Michiganโs \nefforts to impose state law liability penalize extraction and refining activities in foreign countries \ndespite the Presidentโs explicit judgment that energy imports should be exempt from the tariffs \nimposed under Executive Order 14257. \n101.  Michiganโs anticipated lawsuit interferes with the United Statesโ foreign policy on \ngreenhouse gas regulation, including but not limited to the United Statesโ participation in the \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.91     Filed 07/11/25     Page 27 of 66\n \nFramework Convention and announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris \nAgreement, and is therefore preempted. \n102.  This claim does not challenge Michiganโs authority to enact local regulations that \nincidentally affect international corporations, such as environmental standards for in-state \noperations. Instead, the United States seeks to prevent Michigan from pursuing its state law \nclaims because its imposition of liability for worldwide greenhouse gas emissions directly \nintrudes on the federal governmentโs exclusive authority over foreign affairs, including the \nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and trade policy. This extraordinary \nextraterritorial reach and conflict with federal foreign policy distinguish Michiganโs efforts from \nordinary state regulations that do not undermine the United Statesโ ability to speak with one \nvoice in international relations. \n103.  Simply put, Michiganโs attempt โto recover damages for the harms caused by \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions mayโ not โproceed under [Michigan] law.โ City of New York, \n993 F.3d at 91. \n104.  Thus, Michiganโs efforts to impose state law liability on fossil fuel companies are \npreempted by the foreign affairs doctrine.   \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00496-JMB-SJB     ECF No. 8,  PageID.92     Filed 07/11/25     Page 28 of 66\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.
