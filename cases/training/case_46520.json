    "summary": "<p>On April 30, 2025, the United States filed this lawsuit against Hawai'i, its Governor, and its Attorney General in the United States District Court for the District of Hawai'i. The DOJ brought this action after it learned that the state of Hawai'i had plans to bring a lawsuit against fossil fuel companies to hold them liable for their contribution to climate change and its effects. The DOJ argued that such a lawsuit was pre-empted by the Clean Air Act and the federal government's control over foreign affairs, that it would constitute unconstitutional regulation by a state of territory outside the state, and that it would violate the Interstate Commerce and Foreign Commerce Clauses. Specifically, the DOJ argued that through the Clean Air Act, the Congress anointed the federal EPA as the regulator of greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, under the Supremacy Clause, states were pre-empted from regulating greenhouse gas emissions through state law. The DOJ asked the court to declare that Hawai'i's state law claims were unconstitutional, and to permanently enjoin Hawai'i from taking actions to assert Hawai'i's state law claims.</p>\r\n<p>Despite this lawsuit, Hawai'i went ahead with its climate change lawsuit the next day, May 1, in the Circuit Court for the First Circuit of Hawai'i, naming seven fossil fuel companies as defendants. <em>State of Hawai&lsquo;i v. BP p.l.c.,</em> No. 1CCV-25-0000717 (Haw. Cir. Ct. filed May 1, 2025). Hawai'i brought state claims of negligence, public nuisance, private nuisance, trespass, harm to public trust resources, civil aiding and abetting, unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and strict liability for failure to warn. The State argued that the fossil fuel companies had known for decades about the harmful effects of fossil fuel emissions, and to protect their businesses, \"mounted a decades-long campaign of deception to discredit the scientific consensus on climate change; create doubt in the minds of consumers, the media, business leaders, and the public about the climate change impacts of burning fossil fuels; and delay the energy economy's transition to a lower-carbon future while maximizing their own profits.\"</p>\r\n<p>On June 17, in the First Circuit of Hawai'i, Defendants filed a motion to stay proceedings pending resolution of their action against the State in the District Court.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

    "summary_short": "On April 30, 2025, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit against the State of Hawaiโi, its Governor, and Attorney General in the U.S. District Court for the District of Hawaiโi. The DOJ initiated this suit after learning of Hawaiโiโs plans to sue fossil fuel companies for their contributions to climate change. The DOJ argued that Hawaiโiโs proposed lawsuit was pre-empted by the federal Clean Air Act, which grants the EPA the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, making state action in this area unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause. The DOJ also claimed Hawaiโiโs actions would improperly regulate conduct outside its borders and violate the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Clauses. The DOJ sought a declaration that Hawaiโiโs state law claims were unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent Hawaiโi from proceeding.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, on May 1, 2025, Hawaiโi filed its climate change lawsuit in state court against seven fossil fuel companies, citing negligence, nuisance, trespass, harm to public trust resources, civil aiding and abetting, unfair or deceptive practices, and failure to warn. Hawaiโi alleged the companies deliberately misled the public about the dangers of fossil fuels. After defendants moved to stay state proceedings, the court partially granted the motion, pausing the case pending the federal courtโs resolution. The litigation is ongoing.",

The United States is facing an energy crisis. Overly restrictive policies \nand regulation have caused inadequate development of Americaโs abundant energy \nresources. Yet โ[a]n affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to \nthe national and economic security of the United States, as well as our foreign \npolicy.โ Executive Order 14260, Protecting American Energy From State \nOverreach ยง 1.  \n2.  As a result, on January 20, 2025, President Trump declared an energy \nemergency, concluding that the United Statesโ โinsufficient energy production, \ntransportation, refining, and generation constitutes an unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to our Nationโs economy, national security, and foreign policy.โ Executive \nOrder 14156, Declaring a National Energy Emergency ยง 1.  \n3.  As a result of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the \nAmerican people are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to \ndefend itself from hostile foreign actors. Id. \n4.  Hawaii intends to sue fossil fuel companies to seek damages for \nalleged climate change harms. See Sam Spangler, Hawaii To File Lawsuit Against \nFossil Fuel Companies, Khon2 (Apr. 28, 2025), https://www.khon2.com/local-\n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 3 of 31  PageID.3\n \nnews/hawaii-to-file-lawsuit-against-fossil-fuel-companies/ (โโWe will be filing \nsuit, I believe, on Thursday against the fossil fuel companies. They have to pay \ntheir share because climate change and the climate impact is definitely connected \nto generations of extra fossil fuel thatโs been burned.โโ). At a time when States \nshould be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic \nenergy, Hawaii is choosing to stand in the way. This Nationโs Constitution and \nlaws do not tolerate this interference. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n5.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1345. \n6.  This Court has authority to provide the relief requested under the U.S. \nConstitution, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1651, 2201, and 2202, and its inherent legal and \nequitable powers. \n7.  The United States has standing to vindicate its sovereign, proprietary, \nand parens patriae interests. E.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012). \nThe United Statesโ sovereign interests include ensuring that States do not interfere \nwith federal law, including the Clean Air Act, or with the federal governmentโs \nexclusive authority over interstate and foreign commerce, greenhouse gas \nregulation, and national energy policy. The United Statesโ proprietary interests \ninclude its economic interests in revenue from fossil fuel leasing on federal lands, \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 4 of 31  PageID.4\nwhich generated over $13.8 billion in 2024,1 and its costs for purchasing fossil \nfuels, which will increase if Hawaii and other states seek damages from fossil fuel \ncompanies. See City of New York v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 103 (2d Cir. \n2021) (observing that holding fossil fuel producers โaccountable for purely foreign \nactivity (especially the Foreign Producers) would require them to internalize the \ncosts of climate change and would presumably affect the price and production of \nfossil fuels abroad.โ). Additionally, the United States has parens patriae standing to \nprotect the economic well-being of its citizens and the national energy market from \nHawaiiโs attempts to impose extraterritorial and excessive burdens on fossil fuel \ncompanies, which will raise energy costs for consumers nationwide and disrupt the \nuniform regulation of fossil fuel production. These harms affect a substantial \nsegment of the population, and individual litigants, such as fossil fuel businesses, \ncannot fully address the nationwide economic and constitutional injuries caused by \nHawaiiโs overreach. \n1 The Department of the Interior manages land owned by the United States. The \nDepartment issues leases to produce fossil fuels from federal lands and for \nproduction in areas of the Outer Continental Shelf.

Hawaii has announced its intent to file litigation seeking to hold fossil\nfuel companies liable for purported contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. See \nSam Spangler, Hawaii To File Lawsuit Against Fossil Fuel Companies, Khon2 \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 6 of 31  PageID.6\n(Apr. 28, 2025), https://www.khon2.com/local-news/hawaii-to-file-lawsuit-\nagainst-fossil-fuel-companies/. The specific theories on which Hawaii would sue \nare known only to Hawaii, but the goal of the lawsuit is clearโto extract large \nsums of money from fossil fuel companies for purportedly causing climate change \nimpacts to Hawaii. See id. (โโFrankly, fossil fuels deserve to pay their share,โ \nGovernor Green said. โWe were able to weather all of those costs, but it would \nhave been nice to have a couple of billion extra dollars from the fossil fuel \ncompanies. And I will be negotiating that over time.โโ). \nThe Clean Air Act Comprehensively Regulates Nationwide Air Pollution \n15. The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401 et seq., creates a comprehensive\nprogram for regulating air pollution in the United States and โdisplacesโ the ability \nof States to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders. City of New \nYork, 993 F.3d at 96. The Act improves the Nationโs air quality by delegating \nauthority to EPA to prescribe national standards for air pollutants, which States \nthen implement. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411. \n16. In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court\nconcluded that greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are within \nthe Clean Air Actโs unambiguous definition of โair pollutant,โ 42 U.S.C. \nยง 7602(g). Id. at 528-529. Thus, the Clean Air Act delegates to EPA authority to\n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 7 of 31  PageID.7\n \nset nationwide standards for greenhouse gases. See Am. Electric Power Co., Inc. v. \nConnecticut, 564 U.S. 410, 424-429 (2011) (AEP). \n17.  For in-state stationary sources, the Clean Air Act generally preserves \nthe ability of States to adopt and enforce air pollution control requirements and \nlimitations on in-state sources, so long as those are at least as stringent as the \ncorresponding federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 7416. For out-of-state \nsources, however, the โAct gives states a much more limited role,โ even if the \npollution from those sources causes harm within their borders. City of New York, \n993 F.3d at 88. Affected States can: (1) comment on proposed EPA rules and \ncertain permits and plans, see id. ยง 7607(d)(5), ยง 7475(a)(2), ยง 7410(a)(2)(C); 40 \nC.F.R. ยง 51.102(a); (2) seek judicial review if their concerns are not addressed, see \n42 U.S.C. ยง 7607(b); and (3) petition EPA in certain instances, see id. \nยง 7410(k)(5). \nThe United Statesโ Foreign Policy on \nGreenhouse Gas Regulation and Energy Development \n \n18.

Regulating these emissions \nโimplicatesโ not only โthe conflicting rights of statesโ but also โour relations with \nforeign nations.โ Id. at 92.  \n19.  Consistent with the Constitutionโs allocation of supremacy in the field \nof foreign policy to the federal government, see Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 8 of 31  PageID.8\n \n62 (1941), the federal government has demonstrated an active and continuous \ninterest in reconciling protection of the environment, promotion of economic \ngrowth, and maintenance of national security when regulating greenhouse gas \nemissions and fossil fuels, see City of New York, 993 F.3d at 93 (recognizing \nresponsibility of federal government in striking the right โbalanceโ in promoting \nthese goals). The federal government has been actively exercising its authority here \nand has been continually evaluating national interests as is its responsibility under \nthe Constitution. It has โin fact . . . addressedโ these interwoven issues on many \noccasions. Am. Ins. Assโn v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 421 (2003). \n20.  In 1987, Congress enacted the Global Climate Protection Act. See \nPub. L. No. 100-204, Title XI, ยงยง 1101โ1106, 101 Stat. 1331, 1407โ09 (1987), \nreprinted as note to 15 U.S.C. ยง 2901. Among its other goals, the Protection Act \nprovided that the United States should โwork toward multilateral agreementsโ on \nthe issue of greenhouse gas emissions. Id. ยง 1103(a)(4), 101 Stat. at 1408. It \nassigned to the President and EPA the responsibility for devising a โcoordinated \nnational policy on global climate change.โ Id. ยง 1103(b), 101 Stat. at 1408. And the \nProtection Act assigned to the President and the Secretary of State the \nresponsibility for coordination of climate change policy โin the international \narena.โ Id. ยง 1103(c), 101 Stat. at 1409. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 9 of 31  PageID.9\n \n21.  In 1992, President George H. W. Bush signed, and the Senate \nunanimously approved, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \nChange, May 9, 1992, S. Treaty Doc. No. 102-38, 1771 U.N.T.S. 107 (entered into \nforce Mar. 21, 1994), which has as its โultimate objective . . . stabilization of \ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent \ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.โ Id., Art. 2. \n22.  Under the Framework Convention, โ[a]ll Parties,โ including the \nUnited States, โshall . . . .  (b) [f]ormulate, implement, publish and regularly update \nnational and, where appropriate, regional programmes containing measures to \nmitigate climate change by addressing anthropogenic emissions by sources and \nremovals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol, \nand measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to climate change [and] (c) \n[p]romote and cooperate in the development, application and diffusion, including \ntransfer, of technologies, practices and processes that control, reduce or prevent \nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal \nProtocol in all relevant sectors . . . .โ Id., Art. 4.1(b), (c). \n23.  The Framework Convention does not set binding limits on greenhouse \ngas emissions for individual countries. It contains no enforcement mechanism. \nInstead, it includes general obligations addressing climate change and creates a \nframework for cooperation by its parties. Among other things, it contemplates the \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 10 of 31  PageID.10\n \npossibility of its parties negotiating โprotocolsโ or other specific international \nagreements in pursuit of its objective. \n24.  Since approving the Framework Convention, the United States has \nengaged in international efforts regarding climate change and greenhouse gas \nemissions, balancing foreign policy considerations and domestic energy needs. In \nparticular, the United States is also a party to the Kigali Amendment to the \nMontreal Protocol. See Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that \nDeplete the Ozone Layer, Oct. 15, 2016, S. Treaty Doc. No. 117-1, C.N.730.2017. \nThe Amendment commits the United States and other signatory countries to phase \ndown the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas. \nThe Senate ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2022, but only after Congress \nenacted the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7675 in \n2020, giving EPA authority under the Clean Air Act to reduce production and \nconsumption of hydrofluorocarbons. \n25.  By contrast, the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol of \n1997, which provided for greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on UNFCCC \nAnnex I parties, including the United States. Though the United States signed the \nprotocol, President Clinton never submitted it to the Senate for ratification. Instead, \nthe Senate passed a unanimous resolution expressing disapproval of any protocol \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 11 of 31  PageID.11\n \nor other agreement that provides for disparate treatment of economically \ndeveloping countries. S. Res. 98, 105th Cong. (1997).  \n26.  The United States is similarly not a party to the December 12, 2015 \nParis Climate Accord (the Paris Agreement). Paris Agreement to the United \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Dec. 13, 2015, in Rep. of the \nConference of the Parties on the Twenty-First Session, U.N. Doc. \nFCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, annex (2016). In September 2016, President Obama \nsigned the Paris Agreement but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. On \nMarch 28, 2017, President Trump described how the United States would seek to \nreconcile the Nationโs environmental, economic, and strategic concerns. See Exec. \nOrder 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093 (Mar. 28, 2017).  On November 4, 2019, the \nUnited States deposited a notification of withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. \nAlthough on February 19, 2021, President Biden announced that he rejoined this \nexpensive and destructive protocol, on February 13, 2025, President Trump \nwithdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement. See Executive Order 14162, \nPutting America First in International Agreements ยง 3(a). The President explained \nthat โ[i]t is the policy of my Administration to put the interests of the United States \nand the American people first in the development and negotiation of any \ninternational agreements with the potential to damage or stifle the American \neconomyโ and that such agreements โmust not unduly or unfairly burden the \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 12 of 31  PageID.12\n \nUnited States.โ Id. ยง 2. In other words, the President would put the interests of the \nAmerican people first in negotiating the terms of any future treaty to implement the \nFramework Convention \n27.  More recently, on April 2, 2025, President Trump invoked his \nauthority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to \nstrengthen our Nationโs international economic position by imposing reciprocal \ntariffs on U.S. trading partners. See Executive Order 14257, Regulating Imports \nWith a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and \nPersistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits.

Hawaiiโs state law claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act, 42 \nU.S.C. ยงยง 7401 et seq., because they impermissibly regulate out-of-state \ngreenhouse gas emissions and obstructs the Clean Air Actโs comprehensive \nfederal-state framework and EPAโs regulatory discretion, see, e.g., Intโl Paper Co. \nv.

See City of New York, 993 F.3d at 90-100. \nHawaiiโs claims seeking to hold fossil fuel businesses liable for global greenhouse \ngas emissions usurp this federal authority. Hawaiiโs attempt to make fossil fuel \ncompanies โpay their shareโ for greenhouse gas emissions worldwide, most of \nwhich occur outside Hawaiiโs borders, is the type of state regulation of out-of-state \ngreenhouse gas emissions preempted by the Clean Air Act. Sam Spangler, Hawaii \nTo File Lawsuit Against Fossil Fuel Companies, Khon2 (Apr. 28, 2025), \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 15 of 31  PageID.15\n \nhttps://www.khon2.com/local-news/hawaii-to-file-lawsuit-against-fossil-fuel-\ncompanies/. \n35.  Hawaiiโs state law claims conflict with the Clean Air Actโs purposes \nand objectives by undermining its carefully calibrated cooperative federalism \nscheme and EPAโs discretion in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. \n36.  The Clean Air Act establishes a structured partnership between the \nfederal government and States, allowing States to regulate in-state stationary \nsources under specific conditions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7401(a)(3), \n7410(a)(2)(C), 7411(d), 7416, but limiting their role in regulating out-of-state or \nglobal emissions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7410(a)(2)(C), 7410(k)(5), 7475(a)(2), \n7607(b). See also City of New York, 993 F.3d at 88. And the Clean Air Act \ncontains a citizen-suit savings clause. 42 U.S.C. ยง 7604(e). When read together, the \nClean Air Act โplainly permit[s] [S]tates to create and enforce their own emissions \nstandards applicable to in-state polluters.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 99.

Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit โdoes not seek to take advantage of this \nslim reservoir of state common law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 99. Rather, the \nStateโs suit interferes with the Clean Air Actโs balance by effectively regulating \nout-of-state emissions. This extraterritorial regulation creates a patchwork of state-\nlevel penalties that undermines state authority over pollution sources within state \nborders and frustrates the Clean Air Actโs goal of efficiency and predictability in \nthe permit system. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 496; see also AEP, 564 U.S. at 426 \n(holding that the Clean Air Actโs delegation to the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions displaces federal common law, reflecting federal primacy). Such state \nencroachment on federal authority is preempted, as it obstructs the Clean Air Actโs \nintegrated approach to air pollution control. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 497; see \nalso City of New York, 993 F.3d at 90-95. \n38.  Moreover, Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit obstructs EPAโs discretion to \nbalance environmental, economic, and energy considerations in regulating \ngreenhouse gases. The Clean Air Act grants EPA broad authority to promulgate \nregulations based on its expert judgment, including whether to impose emissions \nstandards for stationary sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411 and for mobile sources \nunder 42 U.S.C. ยง 7521. By imposing retroactive liability for lawful conduct, \nHawaii would second-guess EPAโs regulatory choices and imposes penalties that \nCongress did not authorize. \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 17 of 31  PageID.17\n \n39.  Hawaiiโs state law claims would further undermine federal objectives \nby increasing energy costs and disrupting the national energy market, contrary to \nthe Clean Air Actโs integration with national energy policy. As noted in Executive \nOrder 14156 (ยถ 2), insufficient energy production due to restrictive state policies \nthreatens national security and economic prosperity. By targeting major fossil fuel \nbusinesses, many of which operate on federal lands or supply federal agencies, \nHawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit would raise costs for federal operations and \nconsumers nationwide, obstructing the Clean Air Actโs goal of balancing \nenvironmental protection with economic growth. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401(b)(1) \n(CAAโs purpose includes protecting air quality โto promote the public health and \nwelfare and the productive capacity of its populationโ). \n40.  If Hawaii is permitted to pursue these sorts of state law claims, other \nStates could pursue similar claims, leading to a chaotic โpatchworkโ of regulations \nthat undermine the national interest in readily available and affordable energy and \nthe governmentโs ability to effectively administer coherent national environmental \npolicy and regulation of global pollution. City of New York, 993 F.3d at 86. Such \nfragmentation would frustrate Congressโs intent for a unified federal approach to \nglobal air pollution. See Hines, 312 U.S. at 67 (state law preempted when it \nobstructs federal objectives). \n41.  Thus, Hawaiiโs state law claims are preempted by the Clean Air Act. \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 18 of 31  PageID.18\n \nCOUNT II \nUnconstitutional Extraterritorial Regulation \n \n42.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated \nabove. \n43.  The Constitutionโs structure and provisions, including the Due \nProcess Clause, as well as concepts of State sovereignty and federalism, prohibit a \nState from regulating transactions, and imposing liability for conduct, occurring \noutside its borders. Hawaiiโs state law claims violate the Constitution by imposing \nextraterritorial liability for primarily out-of-state extraction and refining activities \nand out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions. Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit is \nirreconcilable with the Constitutionโs commitment of such matters to the federal \ngovernment and the relative rights and obligations of the federal government and \nthe States under the Constitution. \n44.  The United States has standing to assert this claim to protect its \nsovereign, proprietary, and parens patriae interests. Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit, \nwhich would seek extraterritorial liability, interferes with the federal governmentโs \nauthority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and greenhouse gas \nemissions, undermining national energy policy. The financial burdens of Hawaiiโs \nanticipated lawsuit on fossil fuel businesses increase the United Statesโ costs for \npurchasing fuels and threaten revenue from federal leasing. In its parens patriae \ncapacity, the United States seeks to protect citizens nationwide from higher energy \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 19 of 31  PageID.19\n \ncosts and economic disruption caused by Hawaiiโs anticipated overreach, which \nindividual litigants cannot fully address due to the nationwide impact of Hawaiiโs \nstate law claims. \n45.

XIV, ยง 1. The fossil fuel businesses \ntargeted by Hawaiiโs state law claims are persons under the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \n46.  The Constitutionโs structure and principles of due process mandate \nthat while States are sovereign within their borders, they cannot regulate conduct \nbeyond their borders, such as by imposing liability for pollution from out-of-state \nsources. โThe concept of Due Process constraints on a state legislatureโs ability to \nregulate subject matters and transactions beyond the stateโs boundaries, while \nperhaps infrequently litigated in those terms, is not new.โ Gerling Glob. \nReinsurance Corp. of Am. v.

Gore, 517 U.S. 559, 570-71 (1996). โ[I]t follows from these principles of state \nsovereignty and comity that a State may not impose economic sanctions on \nviolators of its laws with the intent of changing the tortfeasorsโ lawful conduct in \nother States.โ Id. at 572. โThe states are not nations, either as between themselves \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 21 of 31  PageID.21\n \nor towards foreign nations,โ and โtheir sovereignty stops short of nationality.โ New \nHampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76, 90 (1883). And โinterstate . . . pollution is a \nmatter of federal, not state, law.โ Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 488. \n50.  Hawaiiโs state law claims violate the Constitutionโs structure and \nprinciples of due process by seeking to impose economic sanctions on fossil fuel \nbusinesses for economic activities that occurred primarily in other States and \naround the world. \n51.  Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit would improperly seek to โimpose strict \nliability for the damages caused by fossil fuel emissions no matter where in the \nworld those emissions were released (or who released them),โ City of New York, \n993 F.3d at 93, including activities in other States and in foreign countries with no \nconnection to Hawaii. โSuch a sprawlingโ scope โis simply beyond the limits of \nstate law.โ Id. at 92. \n52.  Even if an entity has some contacts with Hawaii, such as in-state sales \nor operations, Hawaiiโs effort to collect damages for out-of-state greenhouse gas \nemissions does not arise from or relate to those contacts, violating the requirement \nthat a Stateโs regulatory authority be limited to conduct with a substantial nexus to \nthe State. \n53.  Moreover, the global scope of Hawaiiโs state law claims inherently \noverreaches by seeking to regulate conduct far beyond Hawaiiโs territorial \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 22 of 31  PageID.22\n \njurisdiction, contravening the Due Process Clauseโs territorial limitations on state \nsovereignty. \n54.  Thus, Hawaiiโs state law claims violate the Constitutionโs limits on \nextraterritorial legislation. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Interstate Commerce Clause \n \n55.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated \nabove. \n56.  The Constitution gives Congress โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . \n. . among the several States.โ U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n57.  State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce are \nunconstitutional, even in the absence of federal legislation regulating the activity in \nquestion. Oklahoma Tax Commโn v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179 \n(1995). \n58.  Hawaiiโs state law claims discriminate against interstate commerce \nfacially, in practical effect, and in purpose by targeting commercial activityโfossil \nfuel extraction and refiningโthat occurs primarily if not exclusively in States other \nthan Hawaii, including Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, \nPennsylvania, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. \n59.  Because Hawaiiโs state law claims discriminate against interstate \ncommerce, strict scrutiny applies, and its anticipated lawsuit can be pursued only if \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 23 of 31  PageID.23\n \nโit advances a legitimate local purpose that cannot be adequately served by \nreasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.โ New Energy Co. of Indiana v. \nLimbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988). \n60.  Upon information and belief, Hawaii has no legitimate local public \ninterest in discriminating against interstate commerce. \n61.  Moreover, even if Hawaiiโs state law claims did not facially \ndiscriminate against interstate commerce and did not have non-discriminatory \nalternatives, it would still violate the Interstate Commerce Clause under the \nbalancing test articulated in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). \nUnder Pike, a state law that regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental effects \non interstate commerce is unconstitutional if the burden imposed on interstate \ncommerce is โclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.โ Id. \n62.  Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit would also impose substantial burdens \non interstate commerce. By targeting fossil fuel businesses for extraction and \nrefining activities and greenhouse gas emissions occurring primarily in other States \nand foreign countries, Hawaii would disrupt the national market for fossil fuels. \nHawaiiโs request for damages would increase energy costs for consumers and \nbusinesses nationwide, as these costs are passed through the interstate energy \nmarket. The potential for other States to adopt similar laws creates a risk of \nregulatory fragmentation, undermining the uniform national energy market. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 24 of 31  PageID.24\n \n63.  Hawaiiโs state law claims would impose a substantial and undue \nburden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to any putative \nlocal benefits. \n64.  Thus, Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit would violate the Interstate \nCommerce Clause. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Foreign Commerce Clause \n \n65.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated \nabove. \n66.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of \nthe United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, \nor which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the \nsupreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State \nto the Contrary notwithstanding.โ  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \n67.  The Constitution gives Congress the โPower . . . [t]o regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations . . . .โ  U.S. Const. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n68.  The Foreign Commerce Clause has a negative application. Thus, for \nexample, State laws that impose taxes on foreign commerce โwill not survive \nCommerce Clause scrutiny if the taxpayer demonstrates that the taxโ implicates \none of the four concerns identified in Complete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 \nU.S. 274, 279 (1977). A State law imposing taxes is unconstitutional if it (1) \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 25 of 31  PageID.25\n \napplies to an activity lacking a substantial nexus to the State; (2) is not fairly \napportioned; (3) discriminates against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly \nrelated to the services provided by the State. See Barclays Bank PLC v. Franchise \nTax Bd. Of California, 512 U.S. 298, 310-11 (1994) (citing Complete Auto, 430 \nU.S. at 279). โIn the unique context of foreign commerce, a Stateโs power is \nfurther constrained because of the special need for federal uniformity.โ Id. at 311 \n(cleaned up). Thus, โ[a] tax affecting foreign commerce therefore raises two \nconcerns in addition to the four delineated in Complete Auto.โ Id. โThe first is \nprompted by the enhanced risk of multiple taxation. The second relates to the \nFederal Governmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when regulating \ncommercial relations with foreign governments.โ Id. (cleaned up). \n69.  Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit is not a state tax. But the same limiting \nprinciples that apply to a Stateโs power to impose taxes on foreign commerce also \napply to a Stateโs power to impose penalties, fines, and other civil liability on \nforeign commerce. \n70.  Hawaiiโs state law claims discriminate against foreign commerce \nfacially, in practical effect, and in purpose by imposing penalties or fines that \ndirectly and substantially burden foreign commerce. Hawaii would seek to impose \nliability on fossil fuel businesses for activitiesโextraction and refining of fossil \nfuelsโthat occurred โworldwideโ in foreign countries. Hawaii would seek to \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 26 of 31  PageID.26\n \nimpose liability on these foreign activities even though they lack a substantial \nnexus to Hawaii. Hawaii also would discriminate against foreign commerce and \nimposes liability that is not fairly related to the services provided by the State. \nHawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit would enhance the risk of multiple States imposing \noverlapping liability on foreign commerce for the same activities. And it would \nharm the federal governmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when conducting \ncommercial relations with foreign governments on issues such as regulation of \ngreenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, exports and imports of fossil fuels, and \nnational security.  \n71.  The United States does not challenge Hawaiiโs authority to regulate \nthe local activities of international corporations, such as emissions from in-state \nfacilities or taxes on in-state sales. Ordinary state regulations that incidentally \naffect foreign commerce without such extraterritorial scope or federal interference \nremain permissible under the Foreign Commerce Clause. But Hawaiiโs anticipated \nlawsuit does not fall within this permissible role for States. Rather, Hawaiiโs \nattempt to take โa couple billion extra dollars from the fossil fuel companiesโ for \nworldwide extraction and refining with minimal nexus to Hawaii, imposes a \ndisproportionate burden on foreign commerce, and undermine the federal \ngovernmentโs ability to maintain uniformity in regulating environmental, trade, and \nnational security policy. \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 27 of 31  PageID.27\n \n72.  Thus, Hawaiiโs state law claims violate the Foreign Commerce \nClause. \nCOUNT V \nForeign Affairs Preemption \n \n73.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated \nabove. \n74.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of \nthe United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, \nor which shall be made, under the Authority of the United States, shall be the \nsupreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State \nto the Contrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2. \n75.  Even aside from his military powers as the โCommander in Chief of \nthe Army and Navy,โ U.S. Const. art. II, ยง 2, cl. 1, the Constitutions vests broad \nresponsibility for the conduct of foreign affairs in the President of the United \nStates. \n76.  The President has โPower, by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur.โ Id., \nart. II, ยง 2, cl. 2. \n77.  The President โnominate[s], and by and with the Advice and Consent \nof the Senate, . . . appoint[s] Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.โ \nId. \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 28 of 31  PageID.28\n \n78.  The President โreceive[s] Ambassadors and other public Ministers.โ \nId., , art. II, ยง 3 \n79.  The Constitution authorizes the President to โtake Care that the Laws \nbe faithfully executed.โ Id. \n80.  In short, โthe supremacy of the national power in the general field of \nforeign affairs . . . is made clear by the Constitution.โ Hines, 312 U.S. at 62. \n81.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the provisions of the Constitution \nthat vest authority over foreign affairs in the President to prohibit actions by the \nStates that lie outside their traditional and localized areas of responsibility and \ninstead interfere with the federal governmentโs foreign policy, or otherwise has \nmore than an incidental effect in conflict with express foreign policy. See \nGaramendi, 539 U.S. at 418-20. \n82.  Hawaiiโs state law claims fall outside the area of any traditional state \ninterest. They instead regulate โa uniquely international problemโ that is โnot well-\nsuited to the application of state law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85-86. \n83.  By adopting the Framework Convention, the federal government \nundertook to formulate foreign policy with respect to the โstabilization of \ngreenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent \ndangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.โ  Framework \nConvention, Art. 2. \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 29 of 31  PageID.29\n \n84.  By attempting to impose liability based on greenhouse gas emissions \npurportedly attributable to worldwide fossil fuel extraction and refining, Hawaiiโs \nanticipated lawsuit could undermine the ability of the United States to speak with \none voice on a matter of pressing interest around the globe. Hawaiiโs state law \nclaims also could complicate the United Statesโ relations with foreign countries \nconcerning regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, and exports and \nimports of fossil fuels. And Hawaiiโs state law claims penalize extraction and \nrefining activities in foreign countries despite the Presidentโs explicit judgment that \nenergy imports should be exempt from the tariffs imposed under Executive Order \n14257. \n85.  Hawaiiโs anticipated lawsuit interferes with the United Statesโ foreign \npolicy on greenhouse gas regulation, including but not limited to the United Statesโ \nparticipation in the Framework Convention and announcement of its intention to \nwithdraw from the Paris Agreement, and is therefore preempted. \n86.  This claim does not challenge Hawaiiโs authority to enact local \nregulations that incidentally affect international corporations, such as \nenvironmental standards for in-state operations. Instead, the United States seeks to \nprevent Hawaii from pursuing its state law claims because its imposition of \nliability for worldwide greenhouse gas emissions directly intrudes on the federal \ngovernmentโs exclusive authority over foreign affairs, including the United \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 30 of 31  PageID.30\n \nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change and trade policy. This \nextraordinary extraterritorial reach and conflict with federal foreign policy \ndistinguish Hawaiiโs state law claims from ordinary state regulations that do not \nundermine the United Statesโ ability to speak with one voice in international \nrelations. \n87.  Simply put, Hawaiiโs attempt โto recover damages for the harms \ncaused by global greenhouse gas emissions mayโ not โproceed under [Hawaii] \nlaw.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 91. \n88.  Thus, Hawaiiโs state law claims are preempted by the foreign affairs \ndoctrine. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00179     Document 1     Filed 04/30/25     Page 31 of 31  PageID.31\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.
