Two and one-half months ago on July 2, 2025, the United States and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (collectively, the \"plaintiffs\") sought leave to file a motion for summary judgment in this action. (ECF 33.) The Court, noting the unusual nature of a summary judgment motion so early in the action, required letter briefing on the issue. The defendants, after seeking an extension of its time to file its letter brief, opposed the setting of a summary judgment motion. (ECF 41.) On August 4, 2025, after reviewing the parties' submissions, the Court set a schedule on the plaintiffs' summary judgment motion and expanded the page limitations for all parties on briefing. (ECF 50.) After defendants applied for additional time for consultation in drafting any response to a summary judgment motion, the Court accelerated the date for the plaintiffs to file their motion by over a month, giving the defendants 59 days to prepare and file their response. (ECF 56.) Briefing on the summary judgment motion will be complete by November 19, 2025. Defendants now seek to file their own summary judgment motion with briefing extended out to January 23, 2026. Defendants make two points with appropriate elaboration: the plaintiffs lack standing to bring their claims and their claims lack merit. Defendants are invited to address these important issues in their opposition to summary judgment. Each are independent grounds for denial of plaintiffs' summary judgment motion and, in the case of lack of constitutional standing, dismissal by the Court on its own motion. If and to the extent plaintiffs' summary judgment motion is denied, the Court will hear from the parties as to the appropriateness of defendants filing the proposed motion. The Clerk is requested to terminate the Letter Motion at ECF 78. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge P. Kevin Castel on 9/24/2025) (vfr) (Entered: 09/24/2025)"

The DOJ challenged the Climate Superfund Act, a 2024 New York law that sought to hold fossil fuel companies liable for their contribution to climate change and its effects. The DOJ argued that such a law was pre-empted by the Clean Air Act and the federal government's control over foreign affairs, that it would constitute unconstitutional regulation by a state of territory outside the state, and that it would violate the Interstate Commerce and Foreign Commerce Clauses. Specifically, the DOJ argued that through the Clean Air Act, the Congress anointed the federal EPA as the regulator of greenhouse gas emissions, and therefore, under the Supremacy Clause, states were pre-empted from regulating greenhouse gas emissions through state law. The DOJ asked the court to declare that New York's Climate Superfund Act was unconstitutional, and to permanently enjoin New York from taking actions to implement or enforce the Act. The case was assigned to Judge P. Kevin Castel.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>On June 13, Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The case is ongoing.</p>",

The United States is facing an energy crisis. Overly restrictive policies and \nregulation have caused inadequate development of Americaโs abundant energy resources. Yet \nโ[a]n affordable and reliable domestic energy supply is essential to the national and economic \nsecurity of the United States, as well as our foreign policy.โ Protecting American Energy From \nState Overreach, Exec. Order No. 14260, ยง 1, 90 Fed. Reg. 15,513 (Apr. 8, 2025).  \n2.  As a result, on January 20, 2025, President Trump declared an energy emergency, \nconcluding that the United Statesโ โinsufficient energy production, transportation, refining, and \ngeneration constitutes an unusual and extraordinary threat to our Nationโs economy, national \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 2 of 29\n \nsecurity, and foreign policy.โ Declaring a National Energy Emergency, Exec. Order 14156, ยง 1, \n90 Fed. Reg. 8,433 (Jan. 20, 2025).  \n3.  These problems are โmost pronounced in our Nationโs Northeast and West Coast, \nwhere dangerous State and local policies jeopardize our Nationโs core national defense and \nsecurity needs, and devastate the prosperity of not only local residents but the entire United \nStates population.โ Id. Because of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the \nAmerican people are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to defend itself \nfrom hostile foreign actors. Id. \n4.  At a time when States should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable \nsources of domestic energy, New York has chosen to stand in the way. In December 2024, New \nYork enacted a so-called Climate Change Superfund Act, S.2129B, Chapter 679, Laws of 2024 \nas amended by S.824 (the โSuperfund Actโ), N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยงยง 76-0101 to 76-\n0105 (McKinneyโs 2025). New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes retroactive strict liability and \nextraordinary monetary penalties on businesses that extracted and refined fossil fuels worldwide \nduring the period from 2000 through 2024. N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยงยง 76-0101(9), (21), 76-\n0103(3)(a). By purporting to regulate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, \nthe Act necessarily reaches far beyond the State of New York. The Superfund Act purports to \nregulate nationwide airspace and indeed the entire globe.   \n5.  The Superfund Act is a transparent monetary-extraction scheme.  On its face, the \nstatute purports to build a $75 billion nest egg to fund infrastructure projects within New York, \npaid for by out-of-state businesses. And this $75 billion cost will not be borne solely by the out-\nof-state entities subject to the Superfund Act but also by ordinary Americans from coast to coast, \nindividuals around the world, and in part directly by the United States Treasury, which receives \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 3 of 29\n \nroyalties from oil leases overseen by the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Land \nManagement. \n6.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act attempts to usurp the power of the federal government \nby regulating national and global emissions of greenhouse gases, violating federal law in \nmultiple ways. See City of New York v. Chevron Corp., 993 F.3d 81, 92 (2d Cir. 2021) (holding \nthat the regulation of global greenhouse gas emissions โis simply beyond the limits of state law). \nThe Superfund Act is preempted by the Clean Air Act, exceeds the territorial reach of New \nYorkโs legislative power, unlawfully discriminates against interstate commerce, conflicts with \nfederal interstate commerce power, and is preempted by federal foreign-affairs powers.   \n7.  The Superfund Act is a brazen attempt to grab power from the federal government \nand force citizens of other States and nations to foot the bill for its infrastructure wish list. Along \nthe way, the Superfund Act intrudes on, and interferes with, the federal governmentโs exclusive \nrole in foreign affairs, which includes sensitive policy questions encompassing environmental \nconcerns, economic and trade policies, and national security. This Nationโs Constitution and \nlaws do not tolerate this interference. \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n \n8.  This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1331 and 1345. \n9.  This Court has authority to provide the relief requested under the U.S. \nConstitution, 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 1651, 2201, and 2202, and its inherent legal and equitable powers. \n10.  The United States has standing to vindicate its sovereign, proprietary, and parens \npatriae interests. See, e.g., Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387 (2012). The United Statesโ \nsovereign interests include ensuring that State laws like the Superfund Act do not interfere with \nfederal law, including the Clean Air Act, or with the federal governmentโs exclusive authority \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 4 of 29\n \nover interstate and foreign commerce, greenhouse gas regulation, and national energy policy. \nThe United Statesโ proprietary interests include its economic interests in revenue from fossil fuel \nleasing on federal lands, which generated over $13.8 billion in 2024,1 and its costs for \npurchasing fossil fuels, which will increase due to the Superfund Actโs $75 billion cost recovery \ndemand. See City of New York, 993 F.3d at 103 (observing that holding fossil fuel producers \nโaccountable for purely foreign activity (especially the Foreign Producers) would require them to \ninternalize the costs of climate change and would presumably affect the price and production of \nfossil fuels abroad.โ). Additionally, the United States has parens patriae standing to protect the \neconomic well-being of its citizens and the national energy market from the Actโs extraterritorial \nand excessive burdens, which will raise energy costs for consumers nationwide and disrupt the \nuniform regulation of fossil fuel production. These harms affect a substantial segment of the \npopulation, and individual litigants, such as fossil fuel businesses, cannot fully address the \nnationwide economic and constitutional injuries caused by the Actโs overreach. \n11.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Defendants because they reside in, or \nconduct a substantial portion of their official business in, New York. See FED. R. CIV. P. 4(k)(1). \n12.  Venue is proper in the Southern District of New York pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \nยง 1391, because at least one Defendant resides in the District and because a substantial part of \nthe acts giving rise to this suit occurred within the District. Defendant James has admitted that \nthe Southern District of New York is a proper venue for cases involving the Attorney General. \n \n1 The Department of the Interior manages land owned by the United States. The Department \nissues leases to produce fossil fuels from federal lands and for production in areas of the Outer \nContinental Shelf. Each year, the Department collects substantial revenue from those onshore \nand offshore leases. In 2024, the Department collected revenue of more than $490 million for \ncoal, $950 million for gas, and $12.4 billion for oil.

New Yorkโs Climate Change Superfund Act seeks to impose retroactive fines or \npenalties on major American fossil fuel businesses for what New York alleges are the \nbusinessesโ purported contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. The Superfund Act then funnels \nthose penalty dollars into a fund for New York infrastructure projects that have allegedly been \nnecessitated by climate change โfor purposes of climate change adaptation.โ N.Y. ENVTL. \nCONSERV. LAW ยงยง 76-0101(3), 76-0103(3), (9). \n20.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act singles out a subset of entities (fossil fuel businesses) \nthat (1) extract fossil fuel, which is defined as coal, petroleum products, fuel gases, and natural \ngas, or (2) refine oil. See id. ยงยง 76-0101(10), (12), (13), (18); see also N.Y. ENERGY LAW ยง 1-\n103(7), (8). \n21.  The Superfund Act declares fossil fuel businesses strictly liable for their \npurported indirect contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV.

The Superfund Act would therefore โregulate . . . behavior far beyond New \nYorkโs borders.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 92. New York โdoes not seek to hold [fossil fuel \nbusinesses] liable for the effects of emissions released in New York, or even in New Yorkโs \nneighboring states. Instead, [New York] intends to hold [fossil fuel businesses] liable, under New \nYork law, for the effects of emissions made around the globe . . . .โ Id. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 7 of 29\n \n23.  The Superfund Act excludes downstream users of fossil fuels and entities. It also \nexcludes fossil fuel businesses that lack โsufficient contacts with the state to satisfy the due \nprocess clause of the United States Constitution.โ N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-0101(21). \n24.  As a result of this new strict liability scheme, each fossil fuel business will be \nrequired to pay a substantial โcost recovery demandโโeffectively a retroactive penalty or fine \nbased on the businessโs pro rata share of fossil fuels extracted and refined worldwide from 2000 \nthrough 2024. Id. ยงยง 76-101(7), (9), (21), 76-0103(3)(b). \n25.  The Superfund Act sets a โcost recovery amountโ of $75 billion dollars, which is \nto be collected pro rata from each fossil fuel business for its โcovered greenhouse gas \nemissions.โ Id. ยงยง 76-0101(6), (7), (8), 76-0103(3). \n26.  โCovered greenhouse gas emissionsโ means โthe total quantity of greenhouse gas \nemissions, expressed in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent . . . attributable to the total \namount of fossil fuels extracted by that entity during the covered period, as well as the total \namount of crude oil refined by that entity during the covered period. For the purposes of this \narticle, covered greenhouse gas emissions include those emissions attributable to all fossil fuel \nextraction and refining worldwide by such entity and are not limited to such emissions within the \nstate.โ Id. ยง 76-0101(8). \n27.  The Superfund Act defines โgreenhouse gasโ to mean โcarbon dioxide, methane, \nnitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and any other \nsubstance emitted into the air that may be reasonably anticipated to cause or contribute to \nanthropogenic climate change.โ Id. ยง 75-0101(7); id. ยง 76-0103(15) (defining โ[g]reenhouse gasโ \nby reference to section 75-0101). \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 8 of 29\n \n28.  The Superfund Act requires that the New York Department of Environmental \nConservation issue a notice to each responsible party in โthe same ratio to the cost recovery \namount as the responsible partyโs applicable share of covered greenhouse gas emissions bears to \nthe aggregate applicable shares of covered greenhouse gas emissions of all responsible parties.โ \nN.Y.

ADMIN., New York, State Profile and Energy Estimates, \nhttps://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=NY (updated Jan. 16, 2025) (the โNew York Energy \nProfileโ). At the same time, New York is the Nationโs fifth-largest consumer of petroleum \noverall and the sixth-largest natural gas consumer among the States. Id. \n30.  New York has no coal mines or economically recoverable coal reserves. See id. \n31.  Historically, New York played a significant role in crude oil production. In the \n19th century, it had more than 50 crude oil refineries. See id. But all refineries in New York had \nclosed by the end of the 20th century. See id. From 2000 to June 2024, New York had no \noperating oil refineries. See U.S. ENERGY INFO.

Upon information and belief, nearly all the economic activity and operations that \nNew Yorkโs Superfund Act targets from 2000 to 2024โextraction of fossil fuel and refinement \nof crude oilโoccurred outside New York. \n33.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes liability based on greenhouse gas emissions \ngenerated in many States besides New York and in many other countries besides the United \nStates. \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 9 of 29\n \n34.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes liability on fossil fuel businesses for their \nlawful conduct in extracting and refining fossil fuels in many States besides New York and in \nmany other countries besides the United States. \nThe Clean Air Act Comprehensively Regulates Nationwide Air Pollution \n \n35.  The Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401 et seq., creates a comprehensive program for \nregulating air pollution in the United States and โdisplacesโ the ability of States to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders. City of New York, 993 F.3d at 96. The Act \nimproves the Nationโs air quality by delegating authority to EPA to prescribe national standards \nfor air pollutants, which States then implement. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411. \n36.  In Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007), the Supreme Court concluded that \ngreenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane, are within the Clean Air Actโs \nunambiguous definition of โair pollutant,โ 42 U.S.C. ยง 7602(g). Id. at 528-29. Thus, the Clean \nAir Act delegates to EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases. See Am. \nElectric Power Co., Inc. v. Connecticut (AEP), 564 U.S. 410, 424-29 (2011). \n37.  For in-state stationary sources, the Clean Air Act generally preserves the ability of \nStates to adopt and enforce air pollution control requirements and limitations on in-state sources, \nso long as those are at least as stringent as the corresponding federal requirements. See 42 U.S.C. \nยง 7416. For out-of-state sources, however, the โAct gives states a much more limited role,โ even \nif the pollution from those sources causes harm within their borders. City of New York, 993 F.3d \nat 88.

Greenhouse gas emissions โpresent[] a uniquely international problem of national \nconcern.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85. Regulating these emissions โimplicatesโ not only \nโthe conflicting rights of statesโ but also โour relations with foreign nations.โ Id. at 92 (cleaned \nup).  \n39.  Under the Constitution, foreign-affairs powers are the exclusive domain of the \nfederal government. Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, 62 (1941). Consistent with that structure, \nthe federal government has demonstrated an active and continuous interest in reconciling \nprotection of the environment, promotion of economic growth, and maintenance of national \nsecurity when regulating greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuels. See City of New York, 993 \nF.3d at 93 (recognizing responsibility of federal government in striking the right โbalanceโ in \npromoting these goals). The federal government has been actively exercising its authority here \nand has been continually evaluating national interests as is its responsibility under the \nConstitution. It has โin fact . . . addressedโ these interwoven issues on many occasions. Am. Ins. \nAssโn v. Garamendi, 539 U.S. 396, 421 (2003). \n40.  In 1987, Congress enacted the Global Climate Protection Act. See Pub. L. No. \n100-204, Title XI, ยงยง 1101โ1106, 101 Stat. 1331, 1407โ09 (1987), reprinted as note to 15 U.S.C. \nยง 2901. Among its other goals, the Global Climate Protection Act provided that the United States \nshould โwork toward multilateral agreementsโ on the issue of greenhouse gas emissions.

It assigned to the President and EPA the responsibility for devising \na โcoordinated national policy on global climate change.โ Id. ยง 1103(b), 101 Stat. at 1408.

Bush signed, and the Senate unanimously \napproved, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, May 9, 1992, S. \nTreaty Doc. No. 102-38, 1771 U.N.T.S. 107 (entered into force Mar. 21, 1994), which has as its \nโultimate objective . . . stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a \nlevel that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.โ Id., \nArt. 2. \n42.  Under the Framework Convention, โ[a]ll Parties,โ including the United States, \nโshall . . . .

The Framework Convention does not set binding limits on greenhouse gas \nemissions for individual countries. It contains no enforcement mechanism. Instead, it includes \ngeneral obligations addressing climate change and creates a framework for cooperation by its \nparties. Among other things, it contemplates the possibility of its parties negotiating โprotocolsโ \nor other specific international agreements in pursuit of its objective. \n44.  Since approving the Framework Convention, the United States has engaged in \ninternational efforts regarding climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, balancing foreign \npolicy considerations and domestic energy needs. In particular, the United States is also a party \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 12 of 29\n \nto the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. See Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on \nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, Oct. 15, 2016, S. Treaty Doc. No. 117-1, \nC.N.730.2017. The Amendment commits the United States and other signatory countries to \nphase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons, a greenhouse gas. The \nSenate ratified the Kigali Amendment in 2022, but only after Congress enacted the American \nInnovation and Manufacturing Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7675, in 2020, giving EPA authority under the \nClean Air Act to reduce production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons. \n45.  By contrast, the United States is not a party to the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which \nprovided for greenhouse gas emission reduction targets on UNFCCC Annex I parties, including \nthe United States. Though the United States signed the protocol, President Clinton never \nsubmitted it to the Senate for ratification. Instead, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution \nexpressing disapproval of any protocol or other agreement that provides for disparate treatment \nof economically developing countries. S. Res. 98, 105th Cong. (1997).  \n46.  The United States is similarly not a party to the December 12, 2015 Paris Climate \nAccord (the Paris Agreement). Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention \non Climate Change, Dec. 13, 2015, in Rep. of the Conference of the Parties on the Twenty-First \nSession, U.N. Doc. FCCC/CP/2015/10/Add.1, annex (2016). In September 2016, President \nObama signed the Paris Agreement but did not submit it to the Senate for ratification. On March \n28, 2017, President Trump described how the United States would seek to reconcile the Nationโs \nenvironmental, economic, and strategic concerns. See Exec. Order 13,783, 82 Fed. Reg. 16,093 \n(Mar. 28, 2017). On November 4, 2019, the United States deposited a notification of withdrawal \nfrom the Paris Agreement. Although on February 19, 2021, President Biden announced that he \nrejoined this expensive and destructive protocol, on February 13, 2025, President Trump \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 13 of 29\n \nwithdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement. See Putting America First in International \nAgreements, Executive Order 14162, ยง 3(a), 90 Fed. Reg. 14,162 (Jan. 20, 2025).

In other words, the \nPresident would put the interests of the American people first in negotiating the terms of any \nfuture treaty to implement the Framework Convention. \n47.  More recently, on April 2, 2025, President Trump invoked his authority under the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to strengthen our Nationโs international \neconomic position by imposing reciprocal tariffs on U.S. trading partners. See Regulating \nImports With a Reciprocal Tariff To Rectify Trade Practices That Contribute to Large and \nPersistent Annual United States Goods Trade Deficits, Exec. Order 14257, 90 Fed.

A state law is preempted under the Supremacy Clause when it intrudes into a field \nexclusively occupied by federal law (field preemption) or when it conflicts with federal law by \nstanding as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congressโs objectives (conflict preemption). \nSee City of Milwaukee v.

The Superfund Act is preempted by the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401 et seq., \nbecause it impermissibly regulates out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and obstructs the Clean \nAir Actโs comprehensive federal-state framework and EPAโs regulatory discretion, see, e.g., Intโl \nPaper Co. v.

See City of New York, 993 F.3d at 90-100. New \nYorkโs law, by imposing strict liability and substantial financial penalties on fossil fuel \nbusinesses for their global greenhouse gas emissions, see N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV.

The Superfund Actโs attempt to regulate emissions \nworldwide, most of which occur outside New Yorkโs borders, is the type of state regulation of \nout-of-state greenhouse gas emissions preempted by the Clean Air Act. \n55.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act conflicts with the Clean Air Actโs purposes and \nobjectives by undermining its carefully calibrated cooperative federalism scheme and EPAโs \ndiscretion in regulating greenhouse gas emissions. \n56.  The Clean Air Act establishes a structured partnership between the federal \ngovernment and States, allowing States to regulate in-state stationary sources under specific \nconditions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7401(a)(3), 7410(a)(2)(C), 7411(d), 7416, but limiting their \nrole in regulating out-of-state or global emissions, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. ยงยง 7410(a)(2)(C), \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 16 of 29\n \n7410(k)(5), 7475(a)(2), 7607(b).

ENVTL. CONSERV. Law ยง 76-0103, effectively regulating out-of-\nstate emissions. This extraterritorial regulation creates a patchwork of state-level penalties that \nundermines state authority over pollution sources within state borders and frustrates the Clean \nAir Actโs goal of efficiency and predictability in the permit system. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at \n496; see also AEP, 564 U.S. at 426 (holding that the Clean Air Actโs delegation to the EPA to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions displaces federal common law, reflecting federal primacy). \nSuch state encroachment on federal authority is preempted, as it obstructs the Clean Air Actโs \nintegrated approach to air pollution control. See Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 497; see also City of New \nYork, 993 F.3d at 90-95. \n58.  Moreover, New Yorkโs Superfund Act obstructs EPAโs discretion to balance \nenvironmental, economic, and energy considerations in regulating greenhouse gases. The Clean \nAir Act grants EPA broad authority to promulgate regulations based on its expert judgment, \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 17 of 29\n \nincluding whether to impose emissions standards for stationary sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7411 \nand for mobile sources under 42 U.S.C. ยง 7521. By imposing retroactive liability for lawful \nconduct from 2000 to 2024, the Superfund Act second-guesses EPAโs regulatory choices and \nimposes penalties that Congress did not authorize.  \n59.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act further undermines federal objectives by increasing \nenergy costs and disrupting the national energy market, contrary to the Clean Air Actโs \nintegration with national energy policy. As noted in Executive Order 14156, ยง 1, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8,434, insufficient energy production due to restrictive state policies threatens national security \nand economic prosperity. By targeting major fossil fuel businesses, many of which operate on \nfederal lands or supply federal agencies, the Superfund Act raises costs for federal operations \nand consumers nationwide, obstructing the Clean Air Actโs goal of balancing environmental \nprotection with economic growth. See 42 U.S.C. ยง 7401(b)(1) (Clean Air Actโs purpose includes \nprotecting air quality โto promote the public health and welfare and the productive capacity of its \npopulationโ). \n60.  If laws like New Yorkโs are permitted to stand, other States could enact similar \nliability schemes, leading to a chaotic โpatchworkโ of regulations that undermine the national \ninterest in readily available and affordable energy and the governmentโs ability to effectively \nadminister coherent national environmental policy and regulation of global pollution. City of \nNew York, 993 F.3d at 86. Vermontโs similar legislation imposing strict liability for greenhouse \ngas emissions underscores this risk. Such fragmentation would frustrate Congressโs intent for a \nunified federal approach to global air pollution. See Hines, 312 U.S. at 67 (state law preempted \nwhen it obstructs federal objectives). \n61.  Thus, New Yorkโs Superfund Act is preempted by the Clean Air Act.   \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 18 of 29\n \nCOUNT II \nUnconstitutional Extraterritorial Regulation \n \n62.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n63.  The Constitutionโs structure and provisions, including the Due Process Clause, as \nwell as concepts of State sovereignty and federalism, prohibit a State from regulating \ntransactions, and imposing liability for conduct, occurring outside its borders. New Yorkโs \nSuperfund Act violates the Constitution by imposing extraterritorial liability for primarily out-of-\nstate extraction and refining activities and out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions. The Act is \nirreconcilable with the Constitutionโs commitment of such matters to the federal government and \nthe relative rights and obligations of the federal government and the States under the \nConstitution. \n64.  The United States has standing to assert this claim to protect its sovereign, \nproprietary, and parens patriae interests. New Yorkโs extraterritorial regulation interferes with \nthe federal governmentโs authority to regulate interstate and foreign commerce and greenhouse \ngas emissions, undermining national energy policy. The Superfund Actโs financial burdens on \nfossil fuel businesses increase the United Statesโ costs for purchasing fuels and threaten revenue \nfrom federal leasing. In its parens patriae capacity, the United States seeks to protect citizens \nnationwide from higher energy costs and economic disruption caused by the Superfund Actโs \noverreach, which individual litigants cannot fully address due to the Superfund Actโs nationwide \nimpact. \n65.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides: โ[N]or shall any \nState deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . .โ U.S. \nCONST. amend. XIV, ยง 1. The fossil fuel businesses targeted by New Yorkโs Superfund Act are \npersons under the Fourteenth Amendment. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 19 of 29\n \n66.  The Constitutionโs structure and principles of due process mandate that while \nStates are sovereign within their borders, they cannot regulate conduct beyond their borders, \nsuch as by imposing liability for pollution from out-of-state sources. โThe concept of Due \nProcess constraints on a state legislatureโs ability to regulate subject matters and transactions \nbeyond the stateโs boundaries, while perhaps infrequently litigated in those terms, is not new.โ \nGerling Glob. Reinsurance Corp. of Am. v. Gallagher, 267 F.3d 1228, 1236-37 (11th Cir. 2001) \n(discussing Due Process limits on legislative jurisdiction). Indeed, โ[t]o resolve disputes about \nthe reach of one Stateโs power,โ the Supreme Court โhas long consulted โฆ the Constitutionโs \nstructure and the principles of โsovereignty and comityโ it embraces,โ along with โthe Due \nProcess Clause.โ Natโl Pork Producers Council v. Ross, 598 U.S. 356, 376 (2023) (citation \nomitted). \n67.  It is a well-established โdue process principle that a state is without power to \nexercise โextra territorial jurisdiction,โ that is, to regulate and control activities wholly beyond its \nboundaries.โ Watson v. Emps. Liab. Assur. Corp., 348 U.S. 66, 70 (1954) (citing Home Ins. Co. \nv. Dick, 281 U.S. 397 (1930)). โThe sovereignty of each State, in turn, implie[s] a limitation on \nthe sovereignty of all of its sister Statesโa limitation express or implicit in both the original \nscheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment.โ World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. \nWoodson, 444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980). \n68.  Indeed, the Due Process Clause embodies โmore than a guarantee of immunity \nfrom inconvenient or distant litigationโ but also imposes โterritorial limitations on the power of \nthe respective States.โ Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct. of California, San Francisco \nCnty., 582 U.S. 255, 263 (2017) (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251 (1958)) \n(discussing how the sovereignty of each state imposes limitations on sovereignty of other states). \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 20 of 29\n \nThis limits Statesโ legislative power over certain subject matters just as much as it does judicial \npower. Herederos De Roberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. Teck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1309 (11th \nCir. 2022). \n69.  No single State can enact policies for the entire Nation, nor can a State โeven \nimpose its own policy choice on neighboring States.โ BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. Gore, 517 U.S. \n559, 570-71 (1996). โ[I]t follows from these principles of state sovereignty and comity that a \nState may not impose economic sanctions on violators of its laws with the intent of changing the \ntortfeasorsโ lawful conduct in other States.โ Id. at 572. โThe states are not nations, either as \nbetween themselves or towards foreign nations,โ and โtheir sovereignty stops short of \nnationality.โ New Hampshire v. Louisiana, 108 U.S. 76, 90 (1883). And โinterstate . . . pollution \nis a matter of federal, not state, law.โ Ouellette, 479 U.S. at 488. \n70.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act violates the Constitutionโs structure and principles of \ndue process by imposing economic sanctions on fossil fuel businesses for economic activities \nthat occurred primarily in other States. \n71.  While New Yorkโs Superfund Act purports to limit liability to entities with \nโsufficient contacts with the state to satisfy the due process clause of the United States \nConstitution,โ N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-0101(21), this provision fails to satisfy due \nprocess because the Act โimpose[s] strict liability for the damages caused by fossil fuel \nemissions no matter where in the world those emissions were released (or who released them),โ \nCity of New York, 993 F.3d at 93, including activities in other States and in foreign countries \nwith no connection to New York. โSuch a sprawlingโ scope โis simply beyond the limits of state \nlaw.โ Id. at 92. \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 21 of 29\n \n72.  Even if an entity has some contacts with New York, such as in-state sales or \noperations, the Actโs strict liability for fossil fuel extraction and refining and out-of-state \ngreenhouse emissions does not arise from or relate to those contacts, violating the requirement \nthat a Stateโs regulatory authority be limited to conduct with a substantial nexus to the State. \n73.  Moreover, the Superfund Actโs global scope inherently overreaches, regardless of \nany nexus provision. By imposing a $75 billion cost recovery demand for emissions attributable \nto worldwide fossil fuel activities from 2000 through 2024, the Superfund Act regulates conduct \nfar beyond New Yorkโs territorial jurisdiction, contravening the Due Process Clauseโs territorial \nlimitations on state sovereignty. \n74.  Accordingly, the โsufficient contactsโ provision cannot cure this defect, as the \nSuperfund Actโs focus on global emissions lacks any meaningful connection to New Yorkโs \nlegitimate regulatory interests, rendering it unconstitutional. \n75.  Thus, New Yorkโs Superfund Act violates the Constitutionโs limits on \nextraterritorial legislation. \nCOUNT III \nViolation of the Interstate Commerce Clause \n \n76.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n77.  The Constitution gives Congress โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce . . . among \nthe several States.โ U.S. CONST. art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n78.  State laws that discriminate against interstate commerce are unconstitutional, even \nin the absence of federal legislation regulating the activity in question. Oklahoma Tax Commโn v. \nJefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 179 (1995). \n79.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act discriminates against interstate commerce facially, in \npractical effect, and in purpose by targeting commercial activityโfossil fuel extraction and \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 22 of 29\n \nrefiningโthat occurs primarily if not exclusively in States other than New York, including \nTexas, New Mexico, Louisiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and North Dakota. See \nN.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-0103(3)(a); see also ยง 76-0101(8) (โFor the purposes of this \narticle, covered greenhouse gas emissions include those emissions attributable to all fossil fuel \nextraction and refining worldwide by such entity and are not limited to such emissions within the \nstate.โ). \n80.  Because New Yorkโs Superfund Act discriminates against interstate commerce, \nstrict scrutiny applies, and it can be upheld only if โit advances a legitimate local purpose that \ncannot be adequately served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives.โ New Energy Co. of \nIndiana v. Limbach, 486 U.S. 269, 278 (1988). \n81.  New York has no legitimate local public interest in discriminating against \ninterstate commerce. \n82.  But even if the Court were to somehow find that the Superfund Act advances \nsome legitimate local purpose, it would still fail strict scrutiny because its infrastructure funding \nobjectives can be adequately served by reasonable, non-discriminatory alternatives. For example, \nNew York could fund its $75 billion in infrastructure projects through general taxation, such as \nstate income or sales taxes, or by seeking federal grants, which are commonly used to support \nclimate-related infrastructure without burdening interstate commerce. These alternatives would \nachieve New Yorkโs goals without imposing a discriminatory $75 billion cost recovery demand \non out-of-state fossil fuel businesses, rendering the Superfund Actโs discriminatory approach \nunconstitutional. \n83.  Moreover, even if New Yorkโs Superfund Act did not facially discriminate \nagainst interstate commerce and did not have non-discriminatory alternatives, it would still \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 23 of 29\n \nviolate the Interstate Commerce Clause under the balancing test articulated in Pike v. Bruce \nChurch, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970). Under Pike, a state law that regulates evenhandedly and \nhas only incidental effects on interstate commerce is unconstitutional if the burden imposed on \ninterstate commerce is โclearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.โ Id. \n84.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act purports to serve a legitimate local public interest by \nraising $75 billion to fund infrastructure projects allegedly necessitated by climate change. \nRegardless of whether environmental protection and infrastructure development are valid state \nobjectives, the benefits of the Act are localized to New York and speculative, and the Actโs \nimposition of retroactive liability for global greenhouse gas emissions does not directly address \ncurrent or future environmental challenges within the State. \n85.  The Superfund Act also imposes substantial burdens on interstate commerce. By \ntargeting fossil fuel businesses for extraction and refining activities occurring primarily in other \nStates and foreign countries, the Act disrupts the national market for fossil fuels. The $75 billion \ncost recovery demand will increase energy costs for consumers and businesses nationwide, as \nthese costs are passed through the interstate energy market. And the Actโs retroactive penalties \nfor lawful conduct from 2000 to 2024 discourage investment and innovation in the fossil fuel \nindustry, further burdening interstate commerce. The potential for other States to adopt similar \nlaws creates a risk of regulatory fragmentation, undermining the uniform national energy market. \n86.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes a substantial and undue burden on interstate \ncommerce that is clearly excessive in relation to any putative local benefits. \n87.  New York seeks to hold the largest American fossil fuel businesses liable for their \nextraction and refining activities which, upon information and belief, occur almost exclusively in \nStates other than New York. New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes an aggregate liability of $75 \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 24 of 29\n \nbillion on those fossil fuel businesses. N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-0101(6). The Act will \nraise the cost of energy resources transacted in interstate commerce. \n88.  Thus, New Yorkโs Superfund Act violates the Interstate Commerce Clause. \nCOUNT IV \nViolation of the Foreign Commerce Clause \n \n89.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n90.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. \n2. \n91.  The Constitution gives Congress the โPower . . . [t]o regulate Commerce with \nforeign Nations . . . .โ Id., art. I, ยง 8, cl. 3. \n92.  The Foreign Commerce Clause has a negative application. Thus, for example, \nState laws that impose taxes on foreign commerce โwill not survive Commerce Clause scrutiny if \nthe taxpayer demonstrates that the taxโ implicates one of the four concerns identified in \nComplete Auto Transit, Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 279 (1977). See Barclays Bank PLC v. \nFranchise Tax Bd. of California, 512 U.S. 298, 310 (1994). A State law imposing taxes is \nunconstitutional if it (1) applies to an activity lacking a substantial nexus to the State; (2) is not \nfairly apportioned; (3) discriminates against interstate commerce; or (4) is not fairly related to \nthe services provided by the State. See Barclays Bank PLC, 512 U.S. at 310-11 (citing Complete \nAuto, 430 U.S. at 279). โIn the unique context of foreign commerce, a Stateโs power is further \nconstrained because of the special need for federal uniformity.โ Id. at 311 (cleaned up). Thus, \nโ[a] tax affecting foreign commerce therefore raises two concerns in addition to the four \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 25 of 29\n \ndelineated in Complete Auto.โ Id. โThe first is prompted by the enhanced risk of multiple \ntaxation. The second relates to the Federal Governmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when \nregulating commercial relations with foreign governments.โ Id. (cleaned up). \n93.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act is not a state tax. But the same limiting principles that \napply to a Stateโs power to impose taxes on foreign commerce also apply to a Stateโs power to \nimpose penalties, fines, and other civil liability on foreign commerce. \n94.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act discriminates against foreign commerce facially, in \npractical effect, and in purpose by imposing penalties or fines that directly and substantially \nburden foreign commerce. The Act imposes strict liability on fossil fuel businesses for \nactivitiesโextraction and refining of fossil fuelsโthat occurred โworldwideโ in foreign \ncountries. See N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-0101(8) (โFor the purposes of this article, \ncovered greenhouse gas emissions include those emissions attributable to all fossil fuel \nextraction and refining worldwide by such entity and are not limited to such emissions within the \nstate.โ). The Act imposes liability on these foreign activities even though they lack a substantial \nnexus to New York. The Act does not fairly apportion liability based on commerce in New York. \nThe Act also discriminates against foreign commerce and imposes liability that is not fairly \nrelated to the services provided by the State. The Act enhances the risk of multiple States \nimposing overlapping liability on foreign commerce for the same activities. And the Act harms \nthe federal governmentโs capacity to speak with one voice when conducting commercial \nrelations with foreign governments on issues such as regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, \ntrade policy, exports and imports of fossil fuels, and national security.  \n95.  The United States does not challenge New Yorkโs authority to regulate the local \nactivities of international corporations, such as emissions from in-state facilities or taxes on in-\n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 26 of 29\n \nstate sales. Ordinary state regulations that incidentally affect foreign commerce without such \nextraterritorial scope or federal interference remain permissible under the Foreign Commerce \nClause. But New Yorkโs Superfund Act does not fall within this permissible role for States. \nRather, the Act directly regulates worldwide fossil fuel extraction and refining with minimal \nnexus to New York, imposes a disproportionate $75 billion burden on foreign commerce, and \nundermines the federal governmentโs ability to maintain uniformity in regulating environmental, \ntrade, and national security policy. \n96.  Thus, New Yorkโs Superfund Act violates the Foreign Commerce Clause. \nCOUNT V \nForeign Affairs Preemption \n \n97.  The United States incorporates by reference all allegations stated above. \n98.  The Constitution provides that โ[t]his Constitution, and the Laws of the United \nStates which shall be made in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made, \nunder the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme Law of the Land; . . . any Thing in \nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.โ U.S. Const. art. VI, \ncl.  2. \n99.  Even aside from his military powers as the โCommander in Chief of the Army \nand Navy,โ id. art. II, ยง 2, cl. 1, the Constitution vests broad responsibility for the conduct of \nforeign affairs in the President of the United States. \n100.

The President โnominate[s], and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \nSenate, . . . appoint[s] Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls.โ Id. \n102.

The Constitution authorizes the President to โtake Care that the Laws be faithfully \nexecuted.โ Id. \n104.  In short, โthe supremacy of the national power in the general field of foreign \naffairs . . . is made clear by the Constitution.โ Hines, 312 U.S. at 62. \n105.  The Supreme Court has interpreted the provisions of the Constitution that vest \nauthority over foreign affairs in the President to prohibit actions by the States that lie outside \ntheir traditional and localized areas of responsibility and instead interfere with the federal \ngovernmentโs foreign policy, or otherwise has more than an incidental effect in conflict with \nexpress foreign policy. See Garamendi, 539 U.S. at 418-20. \n106.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act falls outside the area of any traditional state interest. \nIt instead regulates โa uniquely international problemโ that is โnot well-suited to the application \nof state law.โ City of New York, 993 F.3d at 85-86. \n107.  By adopting the Framework Convention, the federal government undertook to \nformulate foreign policy with respect to the โstabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in \nthe atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the \nclimate system.โ  Framework Convention, Art. 2. \n108.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act imposes retroactive liability on fossil fuel businesses \nfor their extraction or refining of fossil fuels โworldwide.โ N.Y. ENVTL. CONSERV. LAW ยง 76-\n0101(8). \n109.  By attempting to impose liability based on greenhouse gas emissions purportedly \nattributable to โworldwideโ fossil fuel extraction and refining, New Yorkโs Superfund Act could \nundermine the ability of the United States to speak with one voice on a matter of pressing \ninterest around the globe. The Act also could complicate the United Statesโ relations with foreign \n27 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 28 of 29\n \ncountries concerning regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, trade policy, and exports and \nimports of fossil fuels. The Act also penalizes extraction and refining activities in foreign \ncountries despite the Presidentโs explicit judgment that energy imports should be exempt from \nthe tariffs imposed under Executive Order 14257. \n110.  New Yorkโs Superfund Act interferes with the United Statesโ foreign policy on \ngreenhouse gas regulation, including but not limited to the United Statesโ participation in the \nFramework Convention and announcement of its intention to withdraw from the Paris \nAgreement, and is therefore preempted. \n111.  This claim does not challenge New Yorkโs authority to enact local regulations that \nincidentally affect international corporations, such as environmental standards for in-state \noperations. Instead, the United States seeks to invalidate New Yorkโs Superfund Act because its \nimposition of retroactive liability for worldwide greenhouse gas emissions directly intrudes on \nthe federal governmentโs exclusive authority over foreign affairs, including the United Nations \nFramework Convention on Climate Change and trade policy. This extraordinary extraterritorial \nreach and conflict with federal foreign policy distinguish the Act from ordinary state regulations \nthat do not undermine the United Statesโ ability to speak with one voice in international relations. \n112.  Simply put, New Yorkโs attempt โto recover damages for the harms caused by \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions mayโ not โproceed under New York law.โ City of New York, \n993 F.3d at 91. \n113.  Thus, New Yorkโs Superfund Act is preempted by the foreign affairs doctrine.   \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03656     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 29 of 29\n \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \nWHEREFORE, the United States respectfully requests that this Court: \nA.
