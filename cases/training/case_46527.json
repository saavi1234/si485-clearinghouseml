          "description": "ORDER CONSOLIDATING CASES AND SETTING BRIEFING SCHEDULE re: (24 in 1:25-cv-03657-CM) MOTION for Preliminary Injunction. I have today received word that the plaintiffs in American Council of Learned Societies et al v. McDonald et al (25-cv-03657) have filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. A few hours ago, I also was assigned a related case, The Authors Guild et al v. National Endowment for the Humanities et al (25-cv- 03923), which appears to be substantially identical to the American Council case. I am tentatively consolidating the two cases for all purposes. All filings should be made under the lower docket number, which is 25-cv-03657. If someone can convince me that that consolidation should be undone, I will take care of it next month. If the plaintiffs in Authors Guild intend to join the motion for a preliminary injunction in American Council, or if they wish to make their own separate motion, they have until May 23, 2025 to do so. If the Government wishes to make any cross motions, it must do so by May 30, 2025. Responsive papers in opposition to the preliminary injunction motion(s) are due on June 5, 2025. Reply papers on the preliminary injunction motion(s) AND responses to any cross motions that the Government makes are due on June 13, 2025. Reply papers on any cross motions made by the Government are due on June 20, 2025. In the highly unlikely event that I require oral argument, I will notify the parties. BY ECF TO ALL COUNSEL. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 5/14/2025) (Motions due by 5/30/2025. Replies due by 6/13/2025. Responses due by 6/5/2025) (ar) (Entered: 05/14/2025)"

Lee Jasperse, and Nicole Jenkins, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated (Dkt. No. 65 in 25-cv-03657) is GRANTED, to the following extent: 1. The Individual Grantee Class, as pleaded, consists of all individual NEH grant recipients whose grants were terminated as part of the April 1-3, 2025 Mass Termination described in the Court's memorandum opinion (the \"Mass Termination\"). The Subrecipient Class, as pleaded, consists of all NEH grant subrecipients whose sponsors' grants were terminated as part of the Mass Termination. Together, the members of the Individual Grantee Class and the Subrecipient Class are referred to herein as 'Class Members,' and the grants to Class Members that were terminated in the Mass Termination are referred to herein as the \"Grants.\" 2. The effectiveness of the termination of The Grants to Class Members is stayed pendente lite; 3. To give effect to this order, Defendants are preliminarily enjoined from re-obligating the funds that would have been payable under the Grants; 4. This preliminary injunction extends only to Class Members and to the Grants. Nothing in this Order imposes any obligations on Defendants with respect to any person who is not a Class Member, or with respect to any NEH grant that was not terminated as part of the Mass Termination: 5. Nothing in this Order precludes Defendants from taking any action consistent with the terms of the grants awarded to Class Members, including disbursing funds to Class Members; however, nothing in this order obligates Defendants to pay out any funds associated with The Grants during the pendency of this lawsuit. SO ORDERED. (Signed by Judge Colleen McMahon on 8/1/2025) (ar) (Entered: 08/06/2025)"

I am ordering simultaneous briefing; if I conclude that responsive briefing is required I will ask for it next week, but as of now I discern no reason why simultaneous briefing should not suffice for the court's purposes. There is absolutely no need to reargue anything that has been fully briefed and is not potentially impacted by CASA; for example, the applicability of the Tucker Act to various claims and the court's power to entertain such claims does not need to be re-addressed. 15 pages should suffice, but you may exceed that by a few more if you believe it absolutely necessary.

    "summary": "<p>On May 1, 2025, the American Council of Learned Societies, the American Historical Association, and the Modern Language Association filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. They named the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and its Acting Chairman, DOGE, and various DOGE officials as defendants. Plaintiffs challenged the dismantling of NEH, including eliminating nearly all of its programs and conducting mass firings of staff. Plaintiffs alleged that the Defendants' dismantling of NEH violated the separation of powers, the Impoundment Control Act, the Appropriations Act, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the First Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Colleen McMahon.</p>\r\n<p>On May 14, 2025, plaintiffs filed a motion for a Preliminary Injunction (PI). That same day, the court consolidated this action with a similar case,<em> <a href=\"../../../../case/46593/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Authors Guild v. National Endowment for the Humanities</a>. </em>On May 27, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.</p>\r\n<p>On May 30, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Combined briefing on the motions to dismiss and for a preliminary injunction is underway.</p>\r\n<p>On July 25, 2025, the court granted in part and denied in part plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. The court stayed defendants' April 2025 grant cancellations for the putative class of grantees and ordered that the grant funds not be regranted to other parties for the duration of the litigation. The court granted preliminary relief because of its finding that plaintiffs were likely to succeed in proving that the grant terminations violated the First Amendment and the APA. Plaintiffs' other claims were dismissed. The court also refrained from directly ordering NEH to pay out the grants, an order it believed had to come from the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\r\n<p>A pretrial conference has been set for September 4, 2025. This case is ongoing.</p>",

(Dkt. No. 75 (the “Am. Compl.”) ¶ 39).1 \n  In the 2024 Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of which \n$192 million was expressly to be used “for support of activities in the humanities, pursuant to \nsection 7(c) of the Act [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] and for administering the functions of the Act.” Pub. \nL. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 282 (Mar. 9. 2024) (the “2024 Act”). In March 2025, by continuing \nresolution, Congress appropriated an additional $207 million, including $192 million in grant and \nadministrative funding, to fund NEH’s activities for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2025. \nPub.  L.  119-24,  §§  1101-08,  139  Stat.  9,  10-12  (Mar.  15,  2025)  (the  “2025  Continuing \nResolution”). These funds were designated for disbursement to a number of recipients in the form \nof awards – some directly to scholars and authors, others to institutions that in turn passed through \ngrant money to sub-recipients – pursuant to regulations that were promulgated pursuant to NEH’s \nrulemaking authority, with notice and comment to affected communities. The terms and conditions \nof these awards provide that only the Office of Grant Management at the NEH has the power to \nissue Notices of Action (grant awards), to revise them and to amend funding levels thereunder. See \nNAT’L  ENDOWMENT  FOR  THE  HUMANITIES,  General  Terms  and  Conditions  for  Awards  to \nOrganizations  (for  grants  and  cooperative  agreements  issued  October 1, 2024, or later), \nhttps://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-2024;  See  also  NAT’L \nENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for Awards to Individuals (for \nawards  with  start  dates  January  1,  2025,  or  later),  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-\nconditions-awards-individuals. \n \n1 Unless otherwise noted, references will be to the docket in Case No. 25-cv-03657. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 3 of 82\n \n  Over the first three days of April 2025, at the behest of representatives of a newly-created \noffice  within  the  Executive  Branch  known  as  the  Department  of  Government  Efficiency \n(“DOGE”), identical emails, purportedly signed by Michael McDonald, the Acting Chairman of \nthe NEH, were sent to at least 1,400 recipients of NEH grant funding, notifying them that their \ngrants were being terminated, effective immediately. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 100-03. \n  Representatives  of  those  recipients  –  including  (i)  individual  grant  recipients  whose \nfunding was cancelled; (ii) prestigious humanities organizations like the American Council on \nLearned Humanities (ACLS), which lost its own NEH funding; and (iii) associations (including \nACLS) whose members were similarly defunded – have commenced two lawsuits in this Court \n(one a class action), challenging the mass grant termination (the “Mass Termination”) and other \nadministrative changes at the NEH as violative of the First Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, the NEH authorizing statute, 20 U.S.C. §§ 951 et seq, and regulations issued \nthereunder, and the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq.2 In both actions, \nPlaintiffs seek preliminary and permanent declaratory and injunctive relief.  \nSeveral  weeks  after  the  filing  of  the  lawsuits,  Plaintiffs  in  both  actions  moved  for \npreliminary injunctions. The Government has cross moved to dismiss both complaints on a variety \nof grounds. (See Dkt. No. 76). The Court ordered preliminary consolidation of the two cases for \nease of administration. (See Dkt. No. 52). \n \n2 The Court is aware of three other lawsuits bringing substantially similar claims: Porwancher v. National \nEndowment for the Humanities et al, 1:25-cv-01180 (D.D.C); Thakur v. Trump, No. 25-CV-04737-RFL \n(N.D. Cal.); and San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, No. 25-CV-01824-JST (N.D. Cal.). So far, \npreliminary injunctions have been entered reinstating some terminated NEH grants to select LGBTQ-\naffiliated organizations, San Francisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1621636 (N.D. Cal. June 9, \n2025), to select researchers at the University of California, Thakur v. Trump, 2025 WL 1734471 (N.D. Cal. \nJune 23, 2025), and to Professor Andrew Porwancher of Arizona State University, Porwancher v. NEH et \nal., 1:25-cv-01180 (D.D.C. July 25, 2025), ECF No. 22.  \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 4 of 82\n \n  By this decision and order, the Court enters a preliminary injunction in Authors Guild, 25-\ncv-3923, staying the April 1-3 Mass Cancellation of grants previously awarded to putative class \nmembers in that case and directing pendente lite that any funds associated with those grants not be \nre-obligated until trial on the merits. The reason is that the class plaintiffs are likely to succeed in \nestablishing that the class members’ grants were terminated in violation of the First Amendment \nto the United States Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act.3 \nBACKGROUND \nA.  PARTIES \n1.  Plaintiffs in Case No. 25 Civ. 3657 (“ACLS Plaintiffs”) \nPlaintiff  ACLS  is  a  nonprofit  organization  whose  members  include  81  scholarly \norganizations. (Dkt. No. 1 (the “ACLS Compl.”) ¶ 12). Its principal place of business is located at \n633 Third Avenue, New York, New York. Id at 1. The mission of ACLS is to advance the \nunderstanding of humanity and human endeavors in an effort to improve the human experience. \nId. ¶ 12. ACLS both conducts projects directly and funds the work of others. Id. ACLS has received \na total of 144 direct grants from the NEH since that agency was founded. Id. ACLS member \norganizations have also received grants directly from the NEH. Id. \nPlaintiff American Historical Association (“AHA”) is a non-profit organization founded in \n1884 and incorporated by Congress in 1889 for the promotion of historical studies. Id. ¶ 13. It is \nheadquartered at 400 A Street SE, Washington DC  20003. Id. at 1. AHA is the largest membership \nassociation of historians in the world, with over 10,400 members. Id. ¶ 13. Both AHA and its \nmembers have received grants from the NEH; AHA members have received over 300 such award \n \n3 The injunction ordered today does not “reinstate” the grants; it simply stays the effectiveness of their termination. \nThis will be explained more fully below. See Section III, infra.  \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 5 of 82\n \nover the last five years, while AHA itself has received nearly 50 NEH grants since the agency was \nfounded. Id.  \nPlaintiff Modern Language Association of America (“MLA”) is a non-profit organization \nfounded in 1883. Id. ¶ 14. Its principal place of business is located at 85 Broad Street, New York, \nNew York. Id. at 1. MLA serves as a leading advocate for the study and teaching of languages and \nliterature, and it operates a publishing program in the humanities. Id. ¶ 14. MLA has over 20,000 \nmembers, whom it supports in a variety of ways, including through its Strategic Partnership \nNetwork, which brings together institutions with a proven commitment to the humanities to \ndevelop critical resources for responding and building a sustainable foundation for the future. Id. \nMLA itself has received nearly 50 grants from the NEH since the agency was founded, and MLA \nmembers have received over 180 such awards during the past three years. Id.  \nAll three plaintiffs in the ACLS action had active NEH grants at the time of the Mass \nTermination, but only ACLS and AHA allege that their grants were terminated. All three plaintiffs \nallege that they have lost or will lose the opportunity to bring claims in the future. All three \norganizations bring claims in their own right, (ACLS Compl. ¶¶ 92-93; 98; 103), as well as in right \nof their members.  \n2.  Plaintiffs in Case No. 25 Civ. 3923 (“Authors Guild Plaintiffs”) \nPlaintiff The Authors Guild was founded in 1912 and is a national non-profit membership \nassociation of more than 14,000 professional, published writers of all genres. Am. Compl. ¶ 11. \nThe Guild, which is headquartered in New York City, counts historians, biographers, academics, \njournalists and other writers of non-fiction and fiction as members. Id. Many Guild members earn \ntheir livelihoods through their writing. Id. Their work covers important issues in history, biography, \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 6 of 82\n \nscience, politics, medicine, business and other areas; they are frequent contributors to the most \ninfluential and well-respected publications in every field. Id. \nThe Guild works to promote the rights and professional interest of authors in various areas, \nincluding copyright, freedom of expression and fair contracts. Id. In addition, it assists members \nin seeking relief when those members do not receive agreed upon funds for their work. Id. The \nAuthors Guild has many members who have received grants from the NEH, including grantees \nunder the NEH’s Public Scholars, Fellowship and Summer Stipend programs whose grants were \npurportedly terminated by Defendants as part of the Mass Termination. Id. \nUnlike ACLS, AHA and MLA, the Authors Guild does not allege that it has ever received \nany grants from the NEH. It brings this case solely in its associational capacity, on behalf of a class \nwhose members include Guild members whose grants were terminated in the recent “Mass \nTermination” of pending NEH grants. Am. Compl. ¶ 11.  \nCo-plaintiffs with The Authors Guild are a number of individual NEH grant recipients.  \nPlaintiff Elizabeth Kadetsky is a professor in the English Department at Penn State \nUniversity. Am. Compl. ¶ 12. NEH awarded her a Public Scholars grant for $60,000 with a grant \nperiod scheduled to begin on May 1, 2025. NEH terminated the grant on April 3, 2025. Id. \nPlaintiff Dr. Valerie Orlando is the Head of Department and Professor of French & \nFrancophone Literatures and Cultures at the University of Maryland, College Park. Am. Compl. ¶ \n13. Dr. Orlando was awarded an NEH Summer Stipend of $6,000. Id. ¶ 14. Her award, which was \nscheduled to have been dispersed on June 1, 2025, was terminated on April 3, 2025. Id. \nPlaintiff Katalin Balog is a resident of this district and a professor of philosophy at Rutgers \nUniversity-Newark. Id. ¶ 15. Professor Balog was awarded a $60,000 grant for the period January \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 7 of 82\n \n1, 2025 through December 31, 2025. Id. ¶ 16. While a portion of the grant has already been \nreceived, the remainder of her grant was terminated on or about April 2, 2025. Id. \nPlaintiff Benjamin Holtzman is a resident of this district and an Assistant Professor of \nHistory at Lehman College. Id. ¶ 17. Professor Holtzman was awarded a $60,000 grant under \nNEH’s Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions program. Id. ¶ 18. The grant, which \nhad a period of performance from September 1, 2024, to August 31, 2025, was cancelled on April \n3, 2025, before it was fully funded. Id. \nPlaintiff William Goldstein was awarded a Public Scholars program grant to support him \nduring the writing of a biography of Larry Kramer, the AIDS activist. Id. ¶ 20. Dr. Goldstein’s \nPublic Scholars award was for $60,000 and was scheduled to run from September 1, 2024 to \nAugust 31, 2025. Id. He has received $50,000 of the awarded funds; he was scheduled to receive \nthe final $10,000 in July 2025, but his grant was terminated on April 3, 2025. Id. \nPlaintiff Lee Jasperse is a Teaching Fellow in the Department of English Language and \nLiterature at the University of Chicago. Id. ¶ 21. On February 19, 2025, Dr. Jasperse received a \nfellowship at the Massachusetts Historical Society (“the MHS”). His acceptance to the MHS \nFellowship program was contingent on the receipt of a $30,000 NEH award under the Fellowship \nPrograms at Independent Research Institutions Program. That funding was terminated effective \nApril 2, 2025. Id. ¶ 22. \nPlaintiff Nicole Jenkins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology and \nCriminology at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and a Visiting Faculty Fellow at Harvard \nUniversity. Id. ¶ 23. On February 11, 2025, Defendant NEH awarded Prof. Jenkins a $60,000 grant \nunder the Awards for Faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities Program so she could \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 8 of 82\n \ncomplete a book. Id. The grant period was set to begin on August 1, 2025, and last through July \n31, 2026. Id. Prof. Jenkins has not received any payments under the grant award to date. Id. In \nApril 2025, NEH terminated her grant. Id. ¶ 24. \n3.  Defendants in Both Actions \nDefendant NEH is a federal agency headquartered in Washington, DC, responsible for \nadministering the NEH grants at issue in this litigation. Id. ¶ 25. Its history and statutory \nauthorization are described more fully below.  \nDefendant  Michael  McDonald  was  the  Acting  Chairman  of  NEH  at  the  time  the \nTermination Notices were issued to NEH Grantees.

The National Endowment for the Humanities \nThe  National  Endowment  for  the  Humanities  is  an  independent  federal  agency  that \nsupports the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction. Am. Compl. ¶ 31. \nThe NEH was authorized by Congress to support high-quality projects and programs in the \nhumanities and make the humanities available to all Americans. Id. ¶ 32. As Congress put it when \ncreating the NEH in 1961, “the humanities belong to all the people of the United States,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 951(1), and the NEH’s mission is to promote that national asset. Id. \nIn enacting the NEH’s founding legislation, Congress recognized that, “An advanced \ncivilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone but must give full value and \nsupport to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better \nunderstanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the future.” 20 \nU.S.C. § 951(3). \nCongress further declared that “Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens. It \nmust therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to the arts and the humanities, \ndesigned to make people of all backgrounds and wherever located masters of their technology and \nnot its unthinking servants.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(4). \nJustifying its decision to fund these efforts, Congress further declared that “it is necessary \nand  appropriate  for  the  Federal  Government  to  help  create  and  sustain  not  only  a  climate \nencouraging  freedom  of  thought,  imagination,  and  inquiry  but  also  the  material  conditions \nfacilitating the release of this creative talent.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(7). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 10 of 82\n \nWhen drafting the NEH’s authorizing legislation, Congress quite explicitly stated that the \nNEH was supposed to serve both a “multicultural” and a novelty function, stating, “It is vital to \ndemocracy to honor and preserve its multicultural artistic heritage as well as support new ideas, \nand therefore it is essential to provide financial assistance to its artists and the organizations that \nsupport their work.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(10) \nTo advance these ideals, Congress established the NEH and authorized it to provide funding \nfor  organizations  and  individuals  involved  in  research,  publication  of  scholarly  works,  and \npromotion of the humanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956 et seq. Setting out the agency’s mission as \ncontemplated  by  Congress,  the  authorizing  statute  provides  that  NEH  may  “enter  into \narrangements,” including “contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of assistance,” to do any and \nall of the following: \n(1)  develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion of progress \nand scholarship in the humanities; \n \n(2)  initiate and support research and programs to strengthen the research and teaching \npotential of the United States in the humanities by making arrangements with \nindividuals or groups to support such activities; \n \n(3)  initiate  and  support  training  and  workshops  in  the  humanities  by  making \narrangements with institutions or individuals; \n \n(4)  initiate and support programs and research which have substantial scholarly and \ncultural significance and that reach, or reflect the diversity and richness of our \nAmerican cultural heritage, including the culture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or \ntribal community initiate and support programs and research which have substantial \nscholarly and cultural significance and that reach, or reflect the diversity and \nrichness of our American cultural; \n \n(5)  foster international programs and exchanges; \n \n(6)  foster the interchange of information in the humanities; \n \n(7)  foster, with groups, education in, and public understanding and appreciation of the \nhumanities; \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 11 of 82\n \n \n(8)  support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities; \n \n(9)  ensure that the benefit of its programs will also be available to our citizens where \nsuch programs would otherwise be unavailable due to geographic or economic \nreasons; and \n \n(10)  foster  programs  and  projects  that  provide  access  to,  and  preserve  materials \nimportant to research, education, and public understanding of, the humanities.  \n \n20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \nThe Senate Committee that reported out the bill authorizing the NEH reiterated what \nCongress had written into the statute in no uncertain terms: “It is the intent of the committee that \nin the administration of this act there be given the fullest attention to freedom of . . . humanistic \nexpression,” and specified that “No undue preference should be given to any particular style or \nschool of thought or expression.” S. Rep. No. 80-300, at 3-4 (1965). To fulfill this goal, the \nauthorizing statute provides that the NEH should fund a broad range of projects, including \nspecifically projects representing traditionally underrepresented recipients. 20 USC § 956(c).  \nThe  statute  also  prohibits  Federal  employees  and  agencies  from  “exercise[ing]  any \ndirection, supervision or control of the policy determination, personnel, or curriculum” of any \ngrantee organization. 20 USC § 953(c). Consistent with this, grant recipients are prohibited from \nusing their funding for any political activity or to “promote any particular political, religious or \nideological point of view.” NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, An Update on NEH Funding \nPriorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump Administration Executive Orders \n(Apr. 24, 2025),  https://www.neh.gov/news/update-neh-funding-priorities-and-agencys-recent-\nimplementation-trump-administration-executive. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 12 of 82\n \nThe authorizing statute provides that the activities of NEH are to be supervised by the \nNational Council on the Humanities, which is made up of the Chairman of the agency and 26 \n“private  citizens  .  .  .  .  who  are  recognized  for  their  broad  knowledge  of,  expertise  in,  or \ncommitment to the humanities.” 20 U.S.C. § 957. The Chairman is appointed to a four-year term, \nid., and is confirmed by the Senate; typically each new president appoints his own Chair, see \nWIKIPEDIA,  National  Endowment  for  the  Humanities  (last  visited  July  22,  2025, \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Endowment_for_the_Humanities.  Members  of  the \nCouncil are appointed to staggered six-year terms; Congress’ goal in so providing was to ensure \nthat members would be appointed across presidential administrations. 20 USC § 957(c). \n2.  The NEH Grant Programs \nPrior to the last few months, the NEH offered 47 different grant programs to support \nmuseums, historic sites, colleges, universities, K-12 teachers, libraries, public television and radio \nstations, research institutions, independent scholars, authors, writers, filmmakers and nonprofits \nnationwide. Am. Compl. ¶ 38. Over its history, the NEH has awarded over $6 billion to support \nmuseums, historic sites, universities, teachers, libraries, documentary filmmakers, public TV and \nradio stations, research institutions, scholars and local humanities programming. Id. ¶ 39. These \ngrants allowed scholars, educators and authors to examine the human condition, promote civics \neducation, understand our cultural heritage, foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs and cultures, \ndevelop  media  and  information  literacy,  create  documentaries  and  podcasts,  facilitate \ngroundbreaking research and preserve and expand access to cultural and historical artifacts. \nId. ¶ 40. Many NEH grants have been used to support research for books that have won prestigious \nprizes, such as the Pulitzer Prize. Id. ¶ 41. Others have funded award-winning documentaries about \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 13 of 82\n \nAmerican history and life, including Ken Burns’ famous television documentary series The Civil \nWar.4 Id. ¶ 42.  \nThe NEH has also provided funding to humanities councils in every U.S. State and \nTerritory. Id. ¶ 43. State and jurisdictional humanities councils tailor their grantmaking and \nprograms  to  the  needs,  resources,  and  interests  of  their  respective  jurisdictions,  while  also \nextending the reach of NEH-funded projects and further strengthening the agency’s connection to \nlocal communities. Id. \nThe NEH disburses grants through a competitive process that is tightly controlled by \nfactors Congress has dictated. NEH typically received around 5,700 applications each year across \nmore than 40 grant programs, and it typically awarded grants to only 16% of applicants. Id. ¶ 44. \nNEH affirmatively works – through its own employees, the National Council on the Humanities, \nand outside peer-reviewers – to support a wide variety of academic disciplines and viewpoints \nwithin those disciplines. Id. \nBefore April 2025, the NEH engaged in a rigorous process for selecting grantees among \nthe many thousands of applicants it receives annually. Id. ¶ 46. Each year, the NEH recruits and \norganizes over 1,000 individual experts into more than 200 peer review panels to review each of \nthe more than 5,500 grant applications the NEH receives annually. See NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR \n \n4 Burns has a lengthy history of NEH support, dating back to the early 1980s and his first documentary film, \nBrooklyn Bridge. The Endowment has funded more than 15 of Burns’ projects, including documentaries on \ncontroversial subjects like the Vietnam War, See Grant No. TR-228365-15, The Vietnam War, NAT’L \nENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, https://apps.neh.gov/publicquery/AwardDetail.aspx?gn=TR-228365-\n15, as well as the much beloved series Baseball, see NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, Ken Burns, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/about/awards/jefferson-lecture/ken-burns-biography.  It  was  recently  reported  that \nNEH provided funding to support Mr. Burns’ latest endeavor, a documentary on the American Revolution. \nSee  Maureen  Dowd,  Donald  Trump,  Our  Foundering  Father,  N.Y.  Times  (July  5,  2025), \nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/05/opinion/donald-trump-fourth-of-july.html. \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 14 of 82\n \nTHE HUMANITIES, NEH’s Application Review Process, https://www.neh.gov/grants/application-\nprocess. \nPeer  review  panels  were  organized  and  overseen  by  NEH  program  officers,  who \nthemselves were experts in the areas of scholarship for which they were asked to review grant \napplications. Am. Compl. ¶ 47. Program officers placed experts on review panels based on a \nvariety of factors, including broad knowledge of the humanities and expertise in specific areas. Id. \n¶ 48. \nAfter a grant application was submitted, a relevant program officer reviewed it and, based \non academic discipline, institutional type, project area, or project type, assigned it to a specific \npeer-review panel for the relevant program. Id. ¶ 49. Each grant application thus received rigorous \nreview by experts in the applicant’s field. Id. ¶ 50. \nThese procedures, which developed over many years, are/were memorialized in directives \nissue by the agency. See, e.g., NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, Public Scholars 2024–\n2025  Notice  of  Funding  Opportunity  (2024),  https://www.neh.gov/sites/default/files/inline-\nfiles/Public%20Scholars%202024%20and%202025%20NOFO.pdf; see also NAT’L ENDOWMENT \nFOR  THE  HUMANITIES,  NEH’s  Application  Review  Process, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/grants/application-process. \nBy statute, the NEH Chair must make all final funding decisions. 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \nHowever, s/he is statutorily prohibited from doing so until the National Council on the Humanities \nreviews evaluations of grant applicants from NEH program officers and peer-review panels and \nsubmits its recommendations to the Chair, who must consider them but is not bound by them. \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 15 of 82\n \n20 U.S.C. §§ 956(c), 957(f);  See also  NAT’L  ENDOWMENT  FOR  THE  HUMANITIES,  NEH’s \nApplication Review Process, https://www.neh.gov/grants/application-process. \n3.  Appropriations \nEach fiscal year, Congress appropriates funds for the NEH to carry out its statutory \nfunctions, including to award grants. Am. Compl. ¶ 52. \nIn the 2024 Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated $207,000,000 to the NEH, of which \n$192,000,000 “shall be available for support of activities in the humanities, pursuant to section \n7(c) [20 U.S.C. § 956(c)] of the Act and for administering the functions of the Act.” Id. ¶ 53. \n$192,000,000 was designated for grants, loans, contracts, and other assistance to further the \nenumerated purposes set forth under the 2024 Act.  \nOn March 15, 2025, Congress enacted the 2025 Continuing Resolution that re-appropriated \nall of the funds appropriated to NEH under the 2024 Act, with the same breakdown on how the \nmoney must be spent. Pub. L. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12 (Mar. 15, 2025). NEH thus \nreceived an additional $207 million that it must spend in 2025, including an additional $192 \nmillion that it must spend on grants and other assistance programs under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). Am. \nCompl. ¶ 54.  \nThus, the vast majority of these funds were appropriated by Congress for the express \npurpose of supporting NEH’s various grant programs – which, at the time of funding, included:   \n•  The Public Scholars Program, which supports the creation of nonfiction with stipends of \n$5,000 per month, or a maximum of $60,000 for a year, conditioned on foregoing all other \nmajor activities (including teaching). Am. Compl. ¶¶ 57, 60. \n \n•  The Fellowships Program, which gives individual scholars uninterrupted time to conduct \nand produce works of literature or scholarship. Id. ¶ 67. This program has facilitated the \ncreation of approximately seven thousand books over the years. Id. ¶ 66. As with the Public \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 16 of 82\n \nScholars Program, the minimum stipend was for $5,000 a month for between six and \ntwelve months. Id. ¶ 69. \n \n•  The Summer Stipends Program provided small grants (covering a period of two months) \nto individuals pursuing advanced research in the humanities at a funding level of $8,000 \nper stipend. Id. ¶ ¶ 73-74. \n \n•  The award for faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities, and Tribal Colleges and Universities provided stipends of $5,000 per month \nfor up to one year for faculty members at these institutions who were conducting research \nand writing relating to the goals of those institutions. Id. ¶¶ 80, 82. \nNEH grantees who participated in these programs were subject to the Program Terms and \nConditions of their various programs, the most recently promulgate of which are found online at \nhttps://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-2024.  These  terms  and \nconditions were promulgated pursuant to the agency’s rule-making authority; changes were posted \npublicly and were subject to a period of public comment prior to being adopted. See Uniform \nAdministrative Requirements, Cost Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, 88 \nFed. Reg. 69,390 (Oct. 6, 2023) (proposed rule) (inviting public comment); see also 89 Fed. Reg. \n30,046 (Apr. 22, 2024) (final rule adopting changes). Consistent with the authorizing statute, the \nterms and conditions prohibit using awards for promotion of a particular political, religious, or \nideological point of view; advocacy for a particular program of social or political action; or support \nof specific public policies or legislation. See NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General \nTerms  and  Conditions  for Awards  to  Organizations,  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-\nconditions-grants-after-oct-2024;  see  also  NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES,  General \nTerms and Conditions for Awards to Individuals (for awards with start dates January 1, 2025, or \nlater), https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-individuals. \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 17 of 82\n \n  2 CFR §200.340 – the provision in the Code of Federal Regulations applicable to federal \ngrants generally – requires that a federal agency disclose, specifically and unambiguously, all \napplicable termination provisions in the terms and conditions of an award. The NEH terms and \nconditions relating to grant termination differ depending on whether the recipient of an award is \nan individual or an organization.  \nThe terms and conditions for individuals provide that “NEH may terminate your fellowship \nor Award for Faculty if, for any reason, you choose to discontinue the proposed program before \nthe end of the period of performance or fail to observe the award’s terms and conditions. If you \ndiscontinue the proposed program before the end of your period of performance, you must return \nany funds received over and above those to which you are entitled.” Am. Compl. ¶¶ 62, 71, 77, 85. \nThe terms and conditions applicable to individual awards do not contain any language about \ntermination predicated on changes in agency priorities.  \nThe terms and conditions for grants to organizations, by contrast, provide that grants may \nbe terminated if they are no longer consistent with agency priorities. “NEH may suspend or \nterminate an award in whole or in part if: an award no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and \npriorities.” See NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for \nAwards  to  Organizations,  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-\n2024. This provision would impact individuals like Plaintiff Jasperse, who was slated to receive \ngrant money that was awarded, not directly to him, but to the MHS, which in turn funded his \nfellowship. Am. Compl. ¶ 21. \nA further limitation on the terms and conditions for termination is found at § 200.340(a)(4), \nwhich provides that the Federal agency or pass-through entity may terminate an award on the \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 18 of 82\n \nground that it no longer effectuates program goals or agency priorities “to the extent authorized by \nlaw.” (emphasis added).  \nA grantee whose funding is terminated is not supposed to be without recourse. The terms \nand conditions and associated regulations give said grantee the right to appeal that termination. \nSpecifically, the NEH terms and conditions applicable to institutions provide that grantees have \nthe right to appeal a termination and set out a procedure for taking such an appeal. See NAT’L \nENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for Awards to Organizations \n(for  grants  and  cooperative  agreements  issued  October 1, 2024,  or  later),  § XIII, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-2024#XIII.5 While the terms \nand conditions for individual grants do not contain a similar provision, see NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR \nTHE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for Awards to Individuals (for awards with start \ndates  January  1,  2025,  or  later),  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-\nindividuals, terminated awards are subject to an objections process, whereby the agency “must \nprovide the recipient with an opportunity to object and provide information challenging the \naction.” 2 C.R.F. § 200.342. \n \n5 “A recipient may appeal NEH’s notice of termination. The IGA must submit the request through eGMS \nReach no later than 30 calendar days after the date of the termination notice and should address it to the \nSenior Deputy Chairman, National Endowment for the Humanities. If appealing, the recipient must provide \na full statement of its position, the pertinent facts, and reasons that support its position. OGM will promptly \nacknowledge the request and forward it to the NEH Senior Deputy Chair, who will consult with the program \noffice, OGM, and the Office of General Counsel.

Events Giving Rise to this Lawsuit: The Mass Termination of Previously- \nAwarded NEH Grants \n \nOn March 13, 2025, NEH Chair Shelly Lowe was directed by the White House to resign \nfrom  her  position.6  See  Shelly  Lowe  Exits  Role  Leading  the  National  Endowment  for  the \nHumanities,  WASH.  POST  (Mar.  12,  2025), \nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/style/2025/03/12/shelly-lowe-national-endowement-\nhumanities/. Shortly thereafter, teams from DOGE began appearing at NEH offices and meeting \nwith NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. Am. Compl. ¶ 96. This followed \na pattern of deploying DOGE teams to multiple agencies, in most cases to carry out mass \nterminations of staff, programs, and grants. Id. ¶ 97. According to the Authors Guild Complaint, \nother agencies similarly impacted in recent months include the National Labor Relations Board, \nthe Inter American Foundation, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the U.S. Institute for \nPeace, the African Development Foundation, and the National Endowment for the Arts. Id.  \nIn or about March 2025 – after the awards of grants at issue in this lawsuit – the Notice of \nFunding Opportunity applicable to the various NEH grant programs was modified to include \nlanguage that awards could not be made for projects that “promot[e] gender ideology;” “Promot[e] \ndiscriminatory equity ideology;” “support for diversity, equity, and including (DEI) or diversity, \nequity,  inclusion  and  accessibility  (DEIA)  initiative  or  activities:  or  “environmental  justice \ninitiatives and activities.” Am.

POST \n(Feb. 25. 2022), https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2022/02/25/shelly-lowe-chair-neh/. \nHowever, as noted above, it is customary for a newly inaugurated President to designate his own NEH \nChair.  \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 20 of 82\n \nOn April 1, 2025, NEH staff members were informed that DOGE sought reductions in \nNEH staff by 70-80%, as well as what could amount to a cancellation of all grants made under the \nBiden administration that had not been fully paid out. Am. Compl. ¶ 98. Acting NEH Chair \nMichael McDonald reportedly told senior staff that DOGE “wants to claw back $175 million’ in \ngrant money that has not yet been disbursed.” Id. Defendants Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox \naccessed lists of open NEH grants and stated that cancelling at least $175 million in grant money \nwas an imperative. Id. ¶ 99. \nAdditional evidence developed in Thakur v. Trump, No. 25-CV-04737-RFL (N.D. Cal.) \nsupports these allegations. In a declaration filed in that case, McDonald stated that open grants \nwere flagged for termination if they involved “diversity, equity, and inclusion,” among other terms, \nand NEH staff were instructed to use spreadsheets  assigning  “High,  Medium,  Low,  or  No \nConnection” labels to outstanding awards to indicate whether and to what extent the grantee’s \nproject appeared to fall afoul of three recent executive orders – specifically Executive Order 14151, \nEnding Radical And Wasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing, issued on January 20, \n2025;  Executive  Order  14173,  Ending  Illegal  Discrimination  and  Restoring  Merit-Based \nOpportunity, issued on January 21, 2025; and Executive Order 14168, Defending Women from \nGender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government, issued on \nJanuary 20, 2025. See Declaration of Michael McDonald ¶¶ 6-9, filed in Thakur v. Trump, No. 25-\nCV-04737-RFL (N.D. Cal. June 19, 2025), ECF No. 48-3 (the “N.D. Cal.

McDonald Declaration, I instructed the Government to \nprovide me with the spreadsheets referenced therein. I received three Excel files:  (i) “NEH-\nAwards-2025 Data Call,” which the Government attests is the spreadsheet discussed at paragraphs \n9 and 10 of the Declaration; (ii) “NEH.Award.Data.2021-2025.Final,” which the Government \nattests is the spreadsheet discussed at paragraphs 13, 14, and 15 of the Declaration; and (iii) “Copy \nof NEH Active Grants (03.28.2025),” which the Government attests is the spreadsheet discussed \nat paragraphs 16 and 17 of the Declaration. These spreadsheets confirm that agency officials \nflagged grants for termination based on their ostensible connection to the study of “DEI,” “gender \nideology,” or “environmental justice.” \nOn or about April 1, 2 and 3, 2025, Defendants Cavanaugh and Fox emailed, or caused to \nbe emailed, nearly identical messages to at least 1,400 NEH grantees, informing them that their \ngrants were being terminated. Am. Compl. ¶ 6. Recipients of these notices included nearly all \ngrantees whose grants were awarded during the Biden Administration. Id. ¶ 100. Plaintiffs refer to \nthese notices as the “Mass Termination,” and the Court finds that moniker appropriate in the \ncircumstances.  \nThe Mass Termination Emails stated as follows:  \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and \nconditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to \nseveral reasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, NEH \nhas reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH \nis repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in furtherance of \nthe President’s agenda. The President’s February 19, 2025 executive order \nmandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and \nfunctions. See Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. \n14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate termination is necessary to \nsafeguard  the  interests  of  the  federal  government,  including  its  fiscal \npriorities…. The termination of your grant represents an urgent priority for \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 22 of 82\n \nthe administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to the \ntraditional notification process is not possible.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 105. The Executive Order cited in the Termination Notice does not relate to the \nNEH or its grant-making function – a fact conceded by Defendants, who admit that the reference \nwas “a mistake” – though one that was never corrected. (Dkt. No. 80 ¶ 13 n.1. (stating the reference \nshould have been to E.O. 14222)). \n   The Termination Notice concluded by telling the recipients, “Please remember that \nyour obligations under the Grant Application continue to apply. Additionally, an audit may \nbe conducted by the NEH after the termination of your grant.” Am. Compl. ¶ 106.7 \nIn some instances, the Termination Notice also provided: \nAny objections or appeals to this termination will be managed in strict accordance \nwith the President’s Executive Orders, including but not limited to: E.O. 14217 \n(Feb. 19, 2025), Commencing the Reduction of the Federal Bureaucracy; E.O. \n14151 (Jan. 20, 2025), Ending Radical and Wasteful Government DEI Programs \nand Preferencing; E.O. 14168 (Jan. 20, 2025), Defending Women from Gender \nIdeology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government; \nand E.O. 14190 (Jan. 29, 2025), Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling.  \nAm. Compl. ¶ 109. None of these Executive Orders contains any information about “objections \nand appeals” or set out any procedure for interposing such objection or taking such appeal. Id. \nSignificantly, these Executive Orders provide that they will be implemented “consistent with \napplicable law.” Am. Compl. ¶ 110.  \n \n7 Among the possible consequences of termination of awards made to individuals is the following: “If during \nyour period of performance you are unable to meet the terms of the award, then you are obliged to inform \nNEH immediately. Because stipend payments are made in advance, you may be required to return a portion \nof the stipend to NEH; if this is the case, NEH will inform you of the amount that you must repay, the basis \nfor the calculation, and the date by which you must repay.” Am. Compl. ¶ 71 (citing the “Termination” \nsection of the Fellowship Program Terms and Conditions”). Thus, anyone whose partially funded grant was \nterminated and who cannot complete the funded project as a result appears to be in danger of having to \nrepay money at the whim of the NEH.  \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 23 of 82\n \nSeveral individual grantees who had their grants  terminated – including specifically \nPlaintiffs Kadetsky, Goldstein, Balog and Orlando – attempted to appeal the termination or sent \ninquiries to NEH regarding the process for appeals. (See Dkt. Nos. 68, 69, 71, 72). NEH responded \nto many of these inquiries by stating that “dispute resolution” was not available or that NEH “is \nunable to offer you a means of dispute resolution.” Am. Compl. ¶ 114. On or about April 29, 2025, \nin a document titled “Guidance for Recipients of Terminated NEH Awards,” NEH Organizational \nGrantees were advised that “NEH is not offering a means of dispute resolution,” even though the \nterms and conditions applicable to such grants specifically provided for an appeal in the event of \ntermination of a grant to an organization. Id. ¶ 112. \nMcDonald advised staff that the NEH’s traditional termination process would not be \nadhered to in connection with the Mass Termination. And indeed, the Mass Termination and \naccompanying Termination Notices were not processed through NEH’s grant management system, \nas  required  by  internal  agency  policies.  They  did  not  emanate  from  the  Office  of  Grant \nManagement, which, according to the terms and conditions, has sole authority to make awards and \nto modify or reduce them. See NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and \nConditions  for  Awards  to  Organizations  (for  grants  and  cooperative  agreements  issued \nOctober 1, 2024,  or  later),  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-\n2024; see also NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for Awards \nto  Individuals  (for  awards  with  start  dates  January  1,  2025,  or  later), \nhttps://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-individuals. The emails did not even \ncome  from  an  NEH  server  or  email  address,  but  from \nGrant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com, a non-governmental email account. Id. ¶ 102. \nThe termination notices were purportedly signed by Defendant McDonald, the Acting Chair of \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 24 of 82\n \nNEH, but Plaintiffs allege that the notices were neither hand-signed by McDonald nor digitally \nsigned with a verifiable digital signature. Id. ¶ 103. \nNeither did McDonald consult with or receive recommendations from the National Council \non the Humanities or with program experts before authorizing this Mass Termination of previously \nawarded grants. Instead, the N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration summarizes how the termination \ndecisions were made as follows: \nOn March 17 - 18, 2025, I worked with NEH Assistant Chairman for Programs Adam \nWolfson to conduct a further individualized review of the spreadsheets to open grants \ncreated by program staff. . . . On March 26, 2025, Mr. Wolfson and I reviewed additional \nspreadsheets of grants that included those the program directors had initially listed as \nhaving no connection to the President’s Executive Orders. On March 31, 2025, I sent \nNEH’s DOGE contacts, Mr. Fox and Mr. Cavanaugh, the final results of NEH’s review in \nwhich  we  identified  grants  that  did  not  appear  to  be  in  conflict  with  the  Trump \nAdministration’s priorities. On or about April 1 - 2, 2025 I terminated a number of, but not \nall, open NEH grants in compliance with Presidential Executive Order 14222 and in \nconsultation with DOGE. . . . As noted above, the policy for selecting grants for termination \nat NEH focused first on identifying open grants that focused on or promoted (in whole or \nin part) “environmental justice,” “diversity, equity, and inclusion” or “diversity, equity, \ninclusion and accessibility,” and “gender ideology.” Subsequently, and in consultation with \nDOGE, I more broadly chose grants for termination that did not contribute to the public’s \nconfidence in how NEH expanded its taxpayer funds as required by NEH’s authorizing \nstatute. See 20 U.S.C. § 951(5). \nN.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration ¶ 13-21.8  \nNearly identical versions of the Termination Notice were sent on April 1, 2 and 3, to both \nindividual  and  organizational  grantees. Am.  Compl.  ¶  100.  No  individualized  review  was \nconducted before grants were cancelled, except to the extent that the aforementioned spreadsheets \n \n8 Plaintiffs plead that McDonald has acknowledged that he did not decide which grants to terminate, although that \nresponsibility rests by statute with him. Am. Compl. ¶ 108. In response to a question from staff about the rationale for \ngrant terminations, he replied that the “rationale was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at other \nagencies and they applied the same methodology here.” Id. However, the N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration appears to \nindicate that McDonald did make the final determinations, or at least participated in making them. As the Court is \ndeciding a Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, I am not limited to the allegations of the pleading or presuming them \nto be true. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 25 of 82\n \nwere used to identify which grants might run afoul of the new Administration’s restriction on \nawards that arguably relate to certain disfavored topics. Id. ¶ 101. Neither was there any finding \nthat any grantee was unable to perform the services for which the grants had been awarded. Id.  \nInterestingly,  McDonald  claims  that  he  chose  for  termination  grants  “that  did  not \ncontribute to the public’s confidence in how NEH expended its taxpayer funds as required by \nNEH’s authorizing statute. See 20 U.S.C. § 951(5).” N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration ¶ 21 \n(emphasis added). But the agency’s authorizing statute specifically requires the NEH to support \nand subsidize activities that “reach or reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural \nheritage, including the culture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community.” 20 U.S.C. § \n956(c)(4). \nAfter the grants were terminated, the NEH put out a press release stating, “In collaboration \nwith the Administration, NEH has cancelled awards that are at variance with agency priorities, \nincluding but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (or DEI) and environmental \njustice, as well as awards that may not inspire public confidence in the use of taxpayer funds.” \nPress Release, NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, An Update on NEH Funding Priorities \nand the Agency’s Recent Implementation of Trump Administration Executive Orders (Apr. 24, \n2025),  https://www.neh.gov/news/update-neh-funding-priorities-and-agencys-recent-\nimplementation-trump-administration-executive.  \nPlaintiffs allege that the Mass Termination was final agency action under the APA. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 704; Am. Compl. ¶ 115. The Mass Termination: (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the \nagency’s decisionmaking process,” and (2) is action “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 178 \n(1997)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  In  particular,  the  Mass  Termination  marks  the \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 26 of 82\n \nconsummation of NEH’s decision-making process with respect to terminated grants because it \nannounces NEH’s decision to immediately terminate those grants in their entirety and does not \nallow for any appeal or reconsideration. Am. Compl. ¶ 115. The Mass Termination is an action by \nwhich rights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow \nbecause it purports to eliminate all government obligations to pay out grant awards and all \ngrantees’ rights to receive their grant awards. Id.  \nI agree with that assessment.  \n5.  Injury to Individual Plaintiffs as a Result of Grant Termination \nThe associational plaintiffs in the ACLS case, the members of those associations, the class \nplaintiffs in Authors Guild and other members of the classes have all pleaded facts concerning how \nthe loss of NEH funding after a grant was awarded impacted them individually. \nAt the time of the Mass Termination, ACLS had two active awards: an award, funded by \nthe Office of Challenge Programs in February 2025, for up to $ 500,000 in Federal matching funds \nto support a three-year cooperative agreement between ACLS and NEH, and an award of a \n$207,000 grant, and up to $105,000 in Federal matching funds, issued by NEH’s Division of \nResearch Programs in 2023. ACLS Compl ¶¶ 92-93. Both grants were terminated in April 2025. \nId. ¶ 93. ACLS alleges that the grants of several of its members have been terminated, id. ¶¶ 95-\n97, and that it had intended to apply for upcoming grant opportunities that have been canceled, id. \n¶ 94. \nAHA also had two active awards: an award of $ 194,261, issued by the Division of \nEducation Programs in March 2025 to fund a three-week program for higher education faculty on \nthe history of U.S. environmental policy, and an award of $ 191,619, issued by the Division of \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 27 of 82\n \nEducation Programs in September 2024 to fund a three-week virtual institute for 30 secondary \nschool teachers on Africa in world history. Id. ¶ 98. Both grants were terminated in April 2025. Id. \n¶ 93. AHA alleges that the grants of several of its members have been terminated, id. ¶¶ 100-02, \nand that it had applied or intended to apply for upcoming grant opportunities that have been \ncanceled, id. ¶ 99. \nMLA had two active awards: a $58,201 “Spotlight in the Humanities” grant, issued by \nNEH’s Division of Education Programs in June 2023 to support a two-year development workshop \nseries for college faculty to reimagine humanities coursework for career readiness, and a grant of \n$30,000 issued by the Office of Data and Evaluation in February 2025 to support a two-day \nconvening of humanities stakeholders to assess the current field of data projects and practices \nrelated to the humanities in higher education. Id. ¶ 103. MLA has not alleged that these awards \nwere terminated. MLA alleges that the grants of several of its members have been terminated, id. \n¶¶ 107-110, and that it had intended to apply for upcoming grant opportunities that have been \ncanceled, id. ¶ 104. \nPlaintiff William Goldstein received a Public Scholars program grant in support of his \nproposed biography of AIDS activist Larry Kramer and received his Termination Notice halfway \nthrough his grant period. Goldstein alleges that, as an independent scholar, he was immediately \nrequired to find alternative work and a new source of income.9 Am. Compl. ¶ 20. \n \n9 Goldstein apparently has several other sources of income: as the founding editor of the books website of \nThe New York Times online; as a book reviewer and interviewer for NBC’s “Weekend Today in New York;” \nand as the curator of public programs at Roosevelt House, the public policy institute of New York’s Hunter \nCollege. Am. Compl. ¶ 19. Which is not to say that he did not need to find a way to replace the income lost \nby the termination of his NEH grant.  \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 28 of 82\n \nPlaintiff Elizabeth Kadetsky, also recipient of a Public Scholars grant, planned to use her \nfunding to complete a book about a 1962 antiquities theft in India as a case study about the \nflourishing trade in illegally acquired antiquities. Id. ¶ 2. As a condition of her grant, Professor \nKadetsky was required to take a one-year leave of absence from her position on the faculty of the \nPennsylvania State University – a leave Penn State was happy, not only to grant, but to subsidize, \nby paying the $35,000 difference between the $60,000 award and her Penn State salary. Id. ¶ 4. \nThe reason Penn State was willing to subsidize its faculty who receive an NEH award is because \nthe university considers an NEH grant to be a “prestigious fellowship.” Id. ¶ 3. Without her grant, \nProfessor Kadetsky has neither any “prestigious fellowship” nor a job for the next academic year.  \nPlaintiff Valerie Orlando received an NEH Summer Stipend to fund her travel to France \nand Algeria in connection with her work on a book on the themes of history and memory in \ncontemporary Algerian literature. Id. ¶ 14. Her book project is now on hold, and the loss of summer \nfunding means she has lost the opportunity to travel at a time when she does not have teaching \nduties. Id. \nPlaintiff Katalin Balog received an NEH Fellowship to work on a book on philosophy and \nconsciousness. Id. ¶ 15. When her grant was terminated after partial funding, she was already on \na leave of absence from her teaching duties (a requirement of accepting the award), so she has at \npresent neither a job nor income. Id. ¶ 16. \nPlaintiff Benjamin Holtzman studies the intersection of political and social history in the \nUnited States, with particular focus on politics, capitalism, race and class, cities and social \nmovements. Id. ¶ 17. His grant was intended to cover the bulk of his living expenses while he \nworked on his book Fighting the White Power Movement in the Late Twentieth Century, a study \nof extremist groups during the 1970s and 1980s. Id. ¶ 18. While he received the bulk of the award \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 29 of 82\n \nbefore it was terminated in April, because he was prohibited from teaching or engaging in “other \nmajor activities,” he is without an alternative source of current income, and is unable to fund \narchival research trips to Atlanta and Kansas City that are needed to continue work on his project. \nId. \nPlaintiff Lee Jasperse has lost the opportunity to become a Fellow of the Massachusetts \nHistorical Society, which had agreed to fund his work on two books exploring how literature \nresponds to persons whose ability to feel or experience sensation has been numbed by various \nincapacitating conditions. Id. ¶ ¶ 21-22. Because it was a condition of the Fellowship that he not \nteach or engage in other major work during the term of his fellowship, Dr Jasperse forewent taking \non other major assignments or work for the six-month period covered by the grant – leaving him \neffectively without income for those months. Id. \nPlaintiff Nicole Jenkins was awarded her grant to complete a book examining Black \nwomen’s navigation of beauty norms, family and U.S. institutions through a Black feminist lens. \nId. ¶ 23. She, too, was required to forego other work as a condition of her grant, and Howard \nUniversity, where she is a non-tenured member of the faculty, gave her a oneyear leave of absence \nfor the period covered by the grant (August 1, 2025-July 31, 2026). Id. Other funding for her work \nwas no longer available by the time the grant was terminated, so loss of her grant endangers her \nability to complete the project that was to have been a core part of her tenure file. Id. ¶ 24. \nThe individual impacts described above are not atypical of the injuries suffered by other \nmembers of the proposed class. Id. ¶ 139. Many NEH grants – including Public Scholars awards, \nFaculty awards, and Fellowship awards – require grantees to forgo teaching and other forms of \nemployment during the grant period, to ensure full-time focus on the funded project. Accordingly, \nmany members of the proposed class sought and obtained leaves of absence or sabbaticals from \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 30 of 82\n \ntheir regular jobs to work on their funded projects. Termination of their grants potentially leaves \nsuch grantees with no source of income during their anticipated grant period. Other class members, \nwhose grants were terminated midway through the grant period, have performed substantial work \non their projects in reliance on the promised grant funds. Much of that work is at risk if the projects \ncannot be completed or if their planned workflows have to be altered due to lack of funds. \nIn addition, all recipients of NEH grants derive non-financial benefits from their NEH \nawards, which have been lost as a result of  the  Mass Termination  of  funding:  publication \nopportunities, including book deals, and honoraria; additional funding from other sources that \nbecomes available because of the prestige of an NEH grant and the confidence that the project has \nbeen vetted by professionals; even job opportunities. These can be summed up in a word: prestige. \nNEH grants conferred prestige in the humanities community, allegedly as a result of the rigorous \nvetting that led to awards.  \nFinally, as noted above, the Termination Notices stated that the grantees’ “obligations under \nthe Grant Application continue to apply,” even though the Government has rescinded funding. \nAm. Compl. ¶ 106. This requirement, Plaintiffs assert, prevents grant recipients from seeking to \nmitigates their losses – or provide for their support – by finding ways to return to work (assuming, \nof course, that their employers have not contracted for temporary replacements). \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 31 of 82\n \n6.  Other Changes at the NEH \nSimultaneously with the Mass Termination, on April 3, 2025, 145 NEH staff members –\nmaking up 80% of NEH’s staff – were reportedly placed on administrative leave. Am. Compl. ¶ \n116. \nOn April 9, 2025, NEH staff received a notice alerting them to an upcoming “multi-step \napproach to restructuring” that promised to include a Reduction in Force (“RIF”). Id. ¶ 117. The \nnotice stated: “NEH is undertaking a multi-step approach to restructuring its internal organization. \nThis restructuring will consolidate administrative and programmatic offices to enhance efficiency \nand streamline functions. As a result, the agency will be forced to reduce the total number of \npositions.” Id. \nThe  very  next  day,  many  NEH  staff  received  RIF  notifications  that  they  would  be \nterminated as of June 10, 2025. Id ¶ 118. Plaintiffs plead, on information and belief, approximately \n70-80% of NEH staff received a RIF notification. Id. \nAs a result of the termination of staff, the NEH has effectively eliminated or nearly \neliminated entire divisions and programs, including but not limited to the Office of Digital \nHumanities, the Office of Federal/State Partnerships, the Office of Data and Evaluation, the Office \nof Native and Indigenous Affairs, the Office of Outreach, and the Office of Partnerships and \nStrategic Initiatives. Id ¶ 119. \nAs a result of Defendants’ actions, the NEH has terminated nearly all of its current grants \nand most of its future programs, despite having nearly $400 million in funding for programs over \nthe last two years, including $192,000,000 it received for grant programs in March 2025. Id ¶ 120. \nIt has also rendered it impossible for the agency to comply with the appeals process for terminated \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 32 of 82\n \ninstitutional  grantees  as  announced  in  the  terms  and  conditions  applicable  to  NEH  grants. \nSee NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General Terms and Conditions for Awards to \nOrganizations,  §  XIII,  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-grants-after-oct-\n2024#XIII, or with the Objections process found in 2 C.F.R. § 200.342. There is simply no one at \nNEH who can performs these functions. \nDays after the Termination Notices revoking tens of millions of dollars in NEH grants were \nsent to Plaintiffs and the Proposed Classes, NEH issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity to award \nup to $17 million in grants to build a “National Garden of American Heroes.” Am. Compl. ¶ 121. \nPlaintiffs allege that this notice of funding is unusual because of its size and the lack of any of the \nrigorous standards for grant-awarding NEH had previously implemented. Plaintiffs also allege that \nit is unusual in that never before had the NEH – rather than the National Endowment for the Arts \n– funded the creation of public visual art.10 Id. \nOn May 8, 2025, NEH announced that it awarded $ 9.55 million in grants for 68 humanities \nprojects. Id. ¶ 122. \nOn May 16, 2025, NEH announced a new grant program “for museums, libraries, archives, \nand  other  cultural  organizations  to  support  public  programs  on  the  ideas  of  the American \nRevolution and the founding of the United States.” Am. Compl. ¶ 123. The program is called \nPublic Impact Projects Celebrating America’s 250th Anniversary. Id. The announcement states \n \n10 The NEH had certainly funded the creation of works that promote public knowledge and awareness of \nthe humanities using the arts and elements of artistic expression. See, e.g., n.4 supra. The Court can find \nnothing in the NEH’s authorizing statute that would prevent the agency from awarding grant money to \nprojects that employ art (in this case, statuary) to memorialize, promote or teach history (one of the \nhumanities) to the public. The proposed National Garden of American Heroes seems far more like the \nNational Baseball Hall of Fame – which employs representational plaques (both artistic and informational \nin nature) to teach the public about the history of the game and honor its (arguably) greatest players – than \nit does the sort of works of visual art that falls traditionally within the purview of the National Endowment \nfor the Arts. The decision by the NEH to fund such an endeavor would ordinarily be “committed to agency \ndiscretion by law.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2).  \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 33 of 82\n \nthat applications are due on July 9, 2025. Id. According to grants.gov, the total program funding is \n$4 million. Id. The Notice of Funding Opportunity states that projects must start between March \n1, 2026, and May 1, 2026. Id. \n7.  Summary of Claims \nPlaintiffs assert claims relating both to the termination of their grants (or their members’ \ngrants) and claims relating to the massive changes made at the NEH (the firing of staff, the \nelimination of programs, the redirecting of funds toward new priorities, including specifically the \nGarden of Heroes). I will refer to the former as “Grant Termination Claims” and to the latter as \n“Institutional Claims.”i \nThe ACLS Plaintiffs’ Complaint: \n  The ACLS Plaintiffs challenge both the termination of grants and the institutional changes \nat the NEH: \n•  Count I: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for violations of the \nSeparation of Powers in connection with Plaintiffs’ Institutional Claims; \n•  Count II: Direct claim for violations of the Separation of Powers in connection \nwith both the Institutional and Grant Termination Claims;  \n•  Count III: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for violations of the \nImpoundment Control Act and Appropriations Act in connection with Plaintiffs’ \nInstitutional Claims;  \n•  Count  IV:  Direct  claim  for  violations  of  the  Impoundment  Control Act  and \nAppropriations Acts in connection with both Plaintiffs’ Institutional and Grant \nTermination Claims;  \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 34 of 82\n \n•  Count  V:  Claim  under  the  Administrative  Procedure  Act  for  arbitrary  and \ncapricious agency action in connection with Plaintiffs’ Institutional Claims;  \n•  Count VI: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for statutory violations \nand  arbitrary  and  capricious  agency  action  in  connection  with  Plaintiffs’ \nInstitutional Claims; \n•  Count VII: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for violations of the \nFirst Amendment in connection with Plaintiffs’ Grant Termination Claims;11 \n•  Count VIII: Direct claim for violations of the First Amendment in connection with \nboth Plaintiffs’ Institutional and Grant Termination Claims; \n•  Count IX: Direct claim asserting that DOGE took action without authority in \nconnection with Plaintiffs’ Institutional and Grant Termination Claims; \nThe Authors Guild Plaintiffs’ Amended Complaint  \nAll claims in this pleading are Grant Termination Claims. The Authors Guild Plaintiffs do \nnot assert any Institutional Claims.  \n•  Count I: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for arbitrary and capricious \nagency action in connection with the Mass Terminations; \n•  Count II: Claim under the Administrative Procedure Act for violations of the \nImpoundment Control Act, NEH Statute, and the First Amendment in connection \nwith the Mass Terminations; \n•  Count  III:  Direct  claim  for  violations  of  the  Impoundment  Control Act  and \nAppropriations Acts in connection with the Mass Terminations; \n \n11 Although Count VII’s title says that it is an “Institutional Claim,” it is clear from the text of pleading that this is a \nmistake, and the count pertains only to Plaintiffs’ Grant Termination Claims. \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 35 of 82\n \n•  Count IV: Direct claim for violations of the Separation of Powers in Connection \nwith the Mass Terminations. \n•  Count V: Direct claim for violations of the First Amendment in connection with \nthe Mass Terminations;  \n•  Count VI: Direct claim asserting that DOGE took action without authority in \nconnection with the Mass Terminations. \nDISCUSSION \nI.  Jurisdiction \nThe claims pleaded in these lawsuits arise under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, the \nauthorizing statute for the National Endowment for the Humanities, 20 U.S.C. § 956 et seq, and \nregulations promulgated thereunder, which can be found at Title 45, Chapter XI, Subchapter D of \nthe Code of Federal Regulations (CFR); and the Constitution of the United States. This Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1331 and the APA. Plaintiffs have not asserted \nclaims for breach of contract and so do not rely on the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1), as a \nbasis for federal jurisdiction. \nVenue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1)(C). This is an action brought \nagainst Government officials acting in their official capacity; several of the plaintiffs reside in this \ndistrict and no real property is involved in this action. Specifically, Plaintiffs American Council of \nLeander Societies, the Modern Language Association and the Authors Guild have their principal \nplaces of business in this district and a significant number of their respective members reside in \nthis district; individual plaintiffs Katalin Balog and Bill Goldstein reside in this District. The \nGovernment has not contested the propriety of venue.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 36 of 82\n \nThe Government raises multiple jurisdictional challenges to Plaintiffs’ ability to bring suit \nin this Court on these claims. Because challenges to the Court’s jurisdiction must be disposed of \nbefore there can be any discussion of the merits, I turn first to those issues.    \na.  Standing \nWhether  a  claimant  has  standing  is  the  threshold  question  in  every  federal  case, \ndetermining the power of the court to entertain the suit. See United States v. Cambio Exacto, S.A., \n166 F.3d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1999). \nTo meet the constitutional requirement of standing, Plaintiffs must establish that they \n“suffered, or will suffer, an injury that is concrete, particularized, and actual or imminent; fairly \ntraceable to the challenged action; and redressable by a favorable ruling.” Murthy v. Missouri, 603 \nU.S. 43, 57 (2024) (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs seeking injunctive relief, moreover, must \nalso show “substantial risk that, in the near future,” the injury will occur. Murthy, 603 U.S. at 44. \nIn sum, the injury-in-fact requirement “screens out plaintiffs who might have only a general legal, \nmoral, ideological, or policy objection to a particular government action.” Food & Drug Admin. v. \nAll. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 381 (2024). \nCausation and redressability, for their part, are usually “flip sides of the same coin.” Sprint \nCmmc’ns Co. v. APCC Servs., Inc., 554 U.S. 269, 288 (2008). The former requires the plaintiff to \nshow that his “injury likely was caused or likely will be caused by the defendant’s conduct.” Food \nand Drug All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 382. And when that is true, “enjoining the action \nor awarding damages for the action will typically redress that injury.” Id. at 381. But if the “plaintiff \nis not himself the object of the government action or inaction he challenges, standing” – though \n“not precluded” – is “ordinarily ‘substantially more difficult’ to establish.” Lujan v. Defs. of \nWildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 562 (1992) (internal citations omitted). \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 37 of 82\n \nTaken together, these bedrock requirements insist that a plaintiff “possess a personal stake” \nin the case, All. for Hippocratic Med., 602 U.S. at 379, which “ensure[s] that courts decide litigants’ \nlegal rights in specific cases” rather than “in the rarified atmosphere of a debating society,” id. \nMoreover, “standing is not dispensed in gross; rather, plaintiffs must demonstrate standing \nfor each claim that they press and for each form of relief that they seek (for example, injunctive \nrelief and damages).” TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 431 (2021). \nWith this in mind, “we proceed to untangle the mass of the plaintiffs’ injuries.” Murthy, \n603 U.S. at 43. To aid us in this “untangling,” I use a summary chart devised by the ACLS Plaintiffs \nthat categorizes the claims asserted in both actions. (See Dkt. No. 86, at 3-4): \nCategory of Claim  Conduct Challenged \n  Elimination of 22 programs \n  Elimination of 6 divisions \n \nFiring 65-75% of employees via RIF \nInstitutional (ACLS Plaintiffs) \nNot spending appropriations \nFunding “Garden of Heroes” \nElimination of programs and divisions, mass \nfiring of staff, not spending appropriations \nGrant Termination (Plaintiffs in Both Actions)  Grant Terminations \n \ni.  Grant Termination Claims: Grant Recipients \nPlaintiffs who are the direct recipients of NEH grants that have been terminated have \nstanding  to  assert  claims  arising  from  those  terminations.  The  Government  has  lodged  no \nobjection, (see Dkt. No. 77, at 12), nor could it. This includes ACLS, AHA and all the individual \nplaintiffs except Lee Jasperse.  \nPlaintiff Jasperse, although not a direct recipient of a NEH grant, has also plausibly alleged \nstanding. Dr. Jasperse alleges that he was slated to be a Fellow at the Massachusetts Historical \nSociety (MHS), the funding for which was entirely (and expressly) supported by a grant from the \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 38 of 82\n \nNEH. He further alleges that, but for NEH’s termination of the grant to MHS, he would have \nretained his grant from MHS. Am. Compl. at 11-12.   \nTherefore, ACLS, AHA, William Goldstien, Elizabeth Kadetsky, Valerie Orlando, Katalin \nBalog, Benjamin Holtzman, Lee Jasperse and Nicole Jenkins have standing with regard to claims \nstemming from their own grant terminations. These claims allege that the Mass Terminations \nviolated the Administrative Procedure Act (ACLS Count VII, AG Counts I, II);12 Separation of \nPowers (ACLS Count II; AG Count IV); the Impoundment Control and Appropriations Acts \n(ACLS Counts III, IV; AG Count III); and the First Amendment (ACLS Count VIII; AG Count V); \nand that DOGE’s actions in connection with the Mass Termination were ultra vires (ACLS Count \nIX; AG Count VI). \nii.  Grant Termination Claims: Associational Standing \nMembership organizations can establish standing based on their own injury or based on \ntheir members’ injuries; the latter standing basis is known as representational or associational \nstanding. Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. \n181, 199 (2023). The Author’s Guild, ACLS, AHA and MLA assert standing with respect to claims \narising from the termination of NEH grants that were awarded to their members. An organization \nhas associational standing to sue on behalf of its members where: “‘(a) its members would \notherwise have standing to sue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane \nto the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires \n \n12 For future reference, “AG Count #” refers to the corresponding enumerated count in the Authors Guild Amended \nComplaint and “ACLS Count #” refers to the corresponding enumerated count in the ACLS Complaint.  \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 39 of 82\n \nthe participation of individual members in the lawsuit.’” Students for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. \nat 181 (quoting Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Advert. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977)). \nThe Authors Guild, ACLS, AHA and MLA each satisfy the three prongs required for \nassociational standing. The Authors Guild identifies itself as a non-profit membership association \nthat “works to promote the rights and professional interests of authors in various areas,” (Dkt. No. \n75 ¶ 11), and counts among its members the above-mentioned Plaintiffs, who have standing in \ntheir own right to bring suit, as well as others who lost NEH grants in the Mass Termination and \ncould similarly sue on their own behalf. All three ACLS Plaintiffs are nonprofit organizations \nwhose  missions  advance  the  public’s  understanding  of  language,  literature  and  the  broader \nhumanities. See ACLS Compl. ¶¶ 12-14. The ACLS Complaint sufficiently alleges that at least \none member of each organization has suffered the termination of a NEH-awarded grant. See id. ¶¶ \n95-110. Indeed, ACLS and AHA plead that they, as organizations, each lost two NEH grants in the \nMass Termination. See id. ¶¶ 92-93; 98.  \nClaims for injunctive relief, relying on a sampling of evidence from association members \n– as we have here – generally satisfy Hunt’s third prong. See, e.g., Ass’n of Am. Physicians & \nSurgeons, Inc. v. Texas Med. Bd., 627 F.3d 547, 551-53 (5th Cir. 2010). This is consistent with the \nholdings of other courts in recent weeks. See, e.g., Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. Educ. v. \nMcMahon, 770 F. Supp. 3d 822, 844 (D. Md. Mar. 2025) (holding that the associational plaintiff \nestablished associational standing by alleging in its compliant that three of its members’ received \ngrants from the U.S. Department of Education, that were subsequently terminated and termination \nof said grants impacted the organization’s core missions); Ass’n of Am. Universities v. Dep't of \nEnergy, No. 25-CV-10912-ADB, 2025 WL 1414135, at *8 (D. Mass. May 15, 2025) (similar \nholding). \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 40 of 82\n \nAccordingly, all Plaintiff organizations have associational standing to pursue the claims \nsummarized in the prior subsection stemming from the termination of NEH grants awarded to their \nmembers. \niii.  The ACLS  Plaintiffs  Lack  Standing  to  Bring Their  Institutional \nClaims  \nIn addition to claims relating to the termination of grants on various grounds, the ACLS \nPlaintiffs (but not the Authors Guild Plaintiffs) assert a number of other claims – claims related to \nthe cancellation of future grant opportunities, the placement of NEH employees on administrative \nleave or their ultimate firing, the NEH’s discontinuation of certain programs and divisions, and the \nfunding of the “Garden of Heroes.” These “Institutional Claims” are brought pursuant to the \nAdministrative Procedure Act (ACLS Counts I, V, VI) and Separation of Powers (ACLS Count II).  \nThe ACLS Plaintiffs lack standing to pursue these Institutional Claims.  \nFirst, these governmental actions – which were not directly visited upon Plaintiffs – are not \nsufficiently traceable to the injury of the allegedly illegal termination of already awarded grants. \nTraceability requires a showing “that the [alleged] injury was likely caused by the defendant.” \nTransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, 594 U.S. 413, 423, (2021). If a plaintiff cannot show that the \nGovernment’s action or inaction is “causally connected to the plaintiff’s injury,” s/he cannot \ndemonstrate Article III standing. California v. Texas, 593 U.S. 659, 660 (2021).  \nPlaintiffs have not alleged facts tending to show that NEH would have to maintain its \ncurrent staffing levels or continue all of the programs that were discontinued in order to redress \nthe action that wronged them – the mass termination of awarded grants in violation of the \nConstitution and the APA.  \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 41 of 82\n \nFurthermore, the Institutional Plaintiffs (ACLS, AHA, MLA) cannot establish standing on \nthe  ground  that  they  or  their  members  were  “planning  on  applying  for  upcoming  grant \nopportunities that have been abruptly cancelled.” ACLS Compl. ¶¶ 94, 99, 104. The ACLS \nPlaintiffs provide supporting declarations alleging that they or their members applied, or were \npreparing to apply, for specific grant programs that have been eliminated. (See Dkt. No. 86, at 13). \nBut while the ACLS Plaintiffs frame this as a “loss of an opportunity to compete” of the sort \nrecognized in Mantena v. Johnson, 809 F.3d 721, 731 (2d Cir. 2015), their reliance is misplaced.  \n In  Mantena,  the  Second  Circuit  held  that  a  petitioner  had  standing  based  on  the \nGovernment’s failure to notify a visa beneficiary of his pending revocation proceeding, in violation \nof regulatory requirements. The plaintiff in Mantena was already engaged in a formal adjudicatory \nprocess; he alleged the loss of a concrete opportunity resulting from a procedural defect. That is \nnot what we have here. Here, we have the sort of “generalized grievance” about Government \nagency operations, which courts have consistently held does not, by itself, amount to an injury-in-\nfact under Article III. Plaintiffs have not established their standing to challenge the NEH’s decision \nnot to operate particular programs or offer particular opportunities in the future.13 \nThe same problem arises with regard to the ACLS Plaintiffs’ claim that the “mass firing of \nNEH staff” and the “loss of entire grant programs” will make it “more difficult for Plaintiffs and \ntheir members to benefit from the professional development and networking opportunities” that \nNEH has historically provided. ACLS Compl. ¶¶ 112-24. Here, the causal chain between the \n \n13 It is also likely that internal NEH decisions regarding what programs to run and what opportunities to extend \nwould fall within the APA’s prohibition against judicial review of agency action “committed to agency discretion by \nlaw.” 5 U.S.C. § 701(a)(2). But the ACLS Plaintiffs’ lack of standing disposes of these claims without the need to \nexamine them further.  \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 42 of 82\n \ngeneral termination of programs and firing of staff and the impact on the ACLS Plaintiffs’ \noperations or on the careers of their members is far too attenuated to support standing. \nMost befuddling is the ACLS Plaintiffs’ challenge to NEH’s decision to invest $17 million \nin the “Garden of Heroes” project. The ACLS Plaintiffs argue that this action will somehow impact \nthem because “Money is zero-sum.” (Dkt. No. 86, at 14). But the ACLS Plaintiffs have not \nidentified any concrete, particularized harm to them resulting from the Government’s decision to \nfund this particular project – nor can I.  \nAs to the Institutional Claims, then, the Government’s Motion to Dismiss the relevant \ncounts in the ACLS Complaint is well taken.  \nb.  Ripeness \nPlaintiffs’ claims that the Mass Terminations constitute an improper deferral or rescission \nof Congressional funds in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (ACLS Count I; AG \nCount II), the Separation of Powers (ACLS Count II; AG Count IV), and the Impoundment Control \nand Appropriations Acts (ACLS Counts III, IV; AG Count III) are not ripe for judicial review. \nCongress appropriated $207 million to NEH, of which $192 million was designated “for \nactivities in the humanities” and $ 15 million to carry out the NEH’s grant program. Pub. L. 118-\n42, 138 Stat. 25, 282 (Mar. 9. 2024) (the “2024 Act”). In March of this year, Congress enacted a \ncontinuing resolution that re-appropriated the same amount of funding that had been appropriated \nto NEH under the 2024 Act, with the same breakdown on how the money was to be spent. See \n2025 Continuing Resolution. \n“Under Article II of the Constitution . . ., the President must follow statutory mandates so \nlong as there is appropriated money available and the President has no constitutional objection to \nthe statute.” In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d 255, 259 (D.C. Cir. 2013); see also Youngstown Sheet & \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 43 of 82\n \nTube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (“When the President takes \nmeasures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress, his power is at its lowest \nebb[.]”). Thus, when Congress appropriates sums of money for certain purposes, the Executive \nmust spend it. See Train v. City of New York, 420 U.S. 35, 42–44 (1975). The President cannot \nrefuse to spend appropriated funds based on policy reasons alone, unless Congress explicitly \napproves the recission. In re Aiken Cnty., 725 F.3d at 259, 261 n.1; see also Impoundment Control \nAct, Pub. L. No. 93-344, 88 Stat. 297 (1974) (appropriated funds “shall be made available for \nobligation” absent congressional recission). \nHowever, the evidence before the Court suggests, not that Defendants are refusing to spend \nthe money appropriated for NEH grants, but rather that they intend to re-obligate those funds to \nother grantees for different projects. (Dkt. No. 80 ¶¶ 19-22). In addition, the awards are sourced to \n“no year” appropriations, meaning Defendants are not required to expend the funds by the end of \na particular fiscal year. Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 281. NEH can still fulfill its statutory mandate \nby reallocating the cancelled grant money. “While the odds of that might appear slim . . ., plaintiffs \nhave presented no evidence that this administration (or for that matter, a future administration) \ncannot, or will not, [spend the money].” Harris Cnty., Texas v. Kennedy, 2025 WL 1707665, at *10 \n(D.D.C. June 17, 2025); Vera Inst. Of Just. V. United States DOJ, 2025 WL 1865160, at *17 \n(D.D.C. July 7, 2025). \nTherefore, these claims are not ripe. For this reason, the Government’s Motion to Dismiss \nthem will be granted.  \nc.  The Tucker Act \nDefendants assert that the terminated NEH grants represent contracts between the grantees \nand the United States, and that Plaintiffs’ claims are essentially claims for breach of those contracts. \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 44 of 82\n \nBecause the Tucker Act vests the Court of Federal Claims with exclusive jurisdiction “to render \njudgment upon any claim against the United States founded . . . upon . . . any express or implied \ncontract with the United States,” 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). The Government argues that this Court \nthus lacks subject matter jurisdiction over all of the Grant Termination claims and so should \ndismiss them as well. Specifically, Defendants argue that the Tucker Act divests this Court of \njurisdiction over “all of Plaintiffs’ claims relating to grant terminations, whether styled as claims \nunder  the  APA,  violations  of  the  separation  of  powers,  Impoundment  Control  Act  or \nAppropriations Act, ultra vires claims, or something else.” (Dkt. No. 77, at 17).  \nAs to this, the Government is wrong.  \nWhether a claim is “founded . . . upon any express or implied contract with the United \nStates” has long been understood to depend upon “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff \nbases its claims, and upon the type of relief sought.” Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. Gen. Servs. \nAdmin., 38 F.4th 1099, 1106 (D.C. Cir. 2022). While the pleadings (and so the introductory pages \nof this opinion) are replete with information about the terms and conditions of their grants, \nPlaintiffs have carefully and deliberately not alleged that their grants were terminated in violation \nof those terms and conditions. Instead, they assert that their grants were terminated in violation of \ntheir First Amendment rights, as well as for reasons that violate both the express terms of the NEH \nauthorizing statute and the APA.   \nDefendants  argue  nonetheless  that  Plaintiffs’  claims  are  “founded  upon”  the  grant \ncontracts. They rely principally on the Supreme Court’s recent issuance of a stay on its Emergency \nDocket in the case Department of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025). In that case, the \nSupreme Court stayed a temporary restraining order that had been issued by The Hon. Myong J. \nJoun of the District of Massachusetts. Judge Joun’s TRO enjoined the Government both from \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 45 of 82\n \nterminating various education-related grants and from “implementing [the grant] terminations . . . \nsuch as [by] suspension or withholding of any funds approved and obligated for the grants.” \nCalifornia v. United States Dep’t of Educ., 769 F. Supp. 3d 72, 80 (D. Mass. 2025). Judge Joun \nheld that the Tucker Act was no bar to his granting the requested relief because, “Plaintiff States \nhave also sufficiently shown that the dispute does not hinge on the terms of a contract between the \nparties, but rather federal statute and regulations put in place by Congress and the Department.” \nId., at 76. \nIn staying the District Court’s decision pending appeal, the Supreme Court reasoned that \nthe Government was likely to succeed in showing that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to \norder the payment of the terminated grants pursuant to the APA because, “The APA’s waiver of \nsovereign immunity does not apply [(i)] if any other statute that grants consent to suit expressly or \nimpliedly forbids the relief which is sought . . . [or (ii)] to claims seeking money damages.” Id. \n(internal quotations omitted). By a 5-4 vote, the Court indicated that the Government’s sovereign \nimmunity waiver was unlikely to apply in California because “the APA’s limited waiver of \nimmunity does not extend to orders ‘to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money’ along the \nlines of what the District Court ordered.” Id. (quoting Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. \nKnudson, 534 U.S. 204, 212, (2002)). And indeed, Judge Joun did order the Department of \nEducation not to hold up payment of the wrongfully terminated grant monies.  \nIn an effort to distinguish this case from California, Plaintiffs argue that their grants are \nnot “contracts” at all. But except as to Plaintiff Jasperse, who did not in fact have a contract with \nthe Government (his fellowship sponsor, MHS, did), I cannot agree. The argument runs contrary \nto Federal Circuit precedent, which defines an enforceable contract for Tucker Act purposes as an \nagreement where there is “(1) mutuality of intent to contract; (2) offer and acceptance; (3) \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 46 of 82\n \nconsideration; and (4) a government representative having actual authority to bind the United \nStates.” Columbus Reg’l Hosp. v. United States, 990 F.3d 1330, 1339 (Fed. Cir. 2021). Federal \ngrant agreements are treated “as contracts when the standard conditions for a contract are satisfied, \nincluding that the federal entity agrees to be bound.” Id. at 1338.  \nPlaintiffs’ contention that the grants are not contracts because they lack bargained-for \nconsideration is also foreclosed by Federal Circuit precedent. Consideration in the context of \nfederal grants “may consist of performance or a return promise to perform, and performance ‘may \nbe a specified act of forbearance, or any one of several specified acts or forbearances of which the \nofferee is given the choice, or such conduct as will produce a specified result.’” Columbus Reg’l \nHosp. v. United States, 990 F.3d 1330, 1340 (Fed. Cir. 2021) (quoting Restatement (Second) of \nContracts § 71 cmt. d (1981)). In that case, the Federal Circuit found consideration present in a \nfederal grant because the recipient “agreed to comply with an array of requirements attached to the \nreceipt, use, and distribution of the grant money.” Id. at 1340.  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ Complaints cite to numerous conditions imposed by the NEH that the \ngrantees accepted, such as where multiple grantees, “as a condition of receiving the [grant money]” \nwere “required by NEH to take a year-long leave of absence from [their] employment to work on \nthe project.” Am. Compl. ¶ 4; see also ¶¶ 16; 18; 60. This requirement of forbearance is repeated \nin the NEH’s General Terms and Conditions, which states, inter alia, that fellowship recipients, \n“must forego teaching, administrative assignments, and other major activities,” faculty having \nbeen awarded grants “must not have course overloads or work overtime during the NEH period of \nperformance,” and public scholars “must reduce their teaching load proportionately” to their grant. \nNEH  General  Terms  and  Conditions  for  Awards  to  Individuals,  at  Section  I.D., \nwww.neh.gov/general-term-and-conditions-awards-individuals  (last  accessed  July  11,  2025). \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 47 of 82\n \nThese  requirements  constitute  the  sort  of  forbearance  that  the  Federal  Circuit  views  as \nconsideration.14 \nHowever, in the California decision, the Supreme Court acknowledged that “a district \ncourt’s jurisdiction ‘is not barred by the possibility’ that an order setting aside an agency’s action \nmay result in the disbursement of funds.” Id. (quoting Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 \n(1988)). The Bowen case, cited by the Court for this proposition, concerned whether “a federal \ndistrict court ha[d] jurisdiction to review a final order of the Secretary of [HHS] refusing to \nreimburse a State for a category of expenditures under its Medicaid program.” Bowen, 487 at \n882. In Bowen, the Supreme Court emphasized that, “Although the Tucker Act is not expressly \nlimited to claims for money damages, it has long been construed as authorizing [in the Court of \nFederal Claims] only actions for money judgments and not suits for equitable relief against the \nUnited States.” Id. at 914 (emphasis added). For that reason, the Court found that where the facts \nof the case, specifically a “Secretary’s interpretation of his regulations” – “may make it appropriate \nfor judicial review to culminate in the entry of declaratory or injunctive relief that requires the \nSecretary to modify future practices . . . We are not willing to assume, categorically, that a naked \nmoney judgment against the United States will always be an adequate substitute for prospective \nrelief fashioned in the light of the rather complex ongoing relationship between the parties.” Id. at \n905. \nThe most salient factor reconciling California with Bowen appears to be that the Court in \nCalifornia viewed the relief ordered by Judge Joun – specifically, his enjoining Defendants from \n“implementing [the grant] terminations . . . such as [by] suspension or withholding of any funds \n \n14 I am constrained to note that the Supreme Court in California could not have ruled as it did without concluding, \nalbeit sub silentio, that the grants in that case were indeed contracts.  \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 48 of 82\n \napproved and obligated for the grants,” CA v. DOE, 769 F. Supp. 3d at 72 – to be the sort of “naked \nmoney judgment” that could and should have been issued by the Court of Federal Claims. By \ncontrast, the Court in Bowen viewed an action involving a more systemic and equitable remedy \nimpacting an agency’s “interpretation of [its] regulations” as falling comfortably within the \njurisdiction of the District Court – even if it might impact some future agency action that would \nrequire the disbursement of funds.   \n I recognize that the Supreme Court’s decision in California is not a final order, see, e.g., \nMerrill v. Milligan, 142 S. Ct. 879 (2022) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (“The principal dissent's \ncatchy but worn-out rhetoric about the ‘shadow docket’ is similarly off target. The stay will allow \nthis Court to decide the merits in an orderly fashion—after full briefing, oral argument, and our \nusual extensive internal deliberations—and ensure that we do not have to decide the merits on the \nemergency docket. To reiterate: The Court’s stay order is not a decision on the merits.”) (emphasis \nadded)), therefore, California does not foreclose the possibility that the Court will someday \nconclude – if it ultimately takes the case on the merits – both that the APA was violated by the \ntermination of the grants at issue, and that the claims asserted under that statute were not, as the \nmajority originally supposed, Tucker Act claims. A number of my fellow jurists have seized on the \npreliminary nature of California – an interlocutory order if ever there was one – to enter \npreliminary injunctions that restore wrongfully terminated grants and/or order the payment of \nmonies thereunder. See, e.g., Thakur v. Trump, 2025 WL 1734471 (N.D. Cal. June 23, 2025); San \nFrancisco A.I.D.S. Found. v. Trump, 2025 WL 1621636 (N.D. Cal. June 9, 2025); Am. Pub. Health \nAss’n v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 1747128 (D. Mass. June 23, 2025), stay denied, Am. \nPub. Health Ass’n v. Nat’l Institutes of Health, 2025 WL 2017106 (1st Cir. July 18, 2025); \nWidakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL 1166400, (D.D.C. Apr. 22, 2025), Widakuswara v. Lake, 2025 WL \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 49 of 82\n \n1166400 (D.D.C. Apr. 22, 2025), stay granted, Widakuswara v. Lake, Nos. 25-5145; 25-5150; 25-\n5151, 2025 WL 1288817 (D.C. Cir. May 3, 2025), on reconsideration en banc, Nos. 25-5150; 25-\n5151, 2025 WL 1521355 (D.C. Cir. May 28, 2025) (vacating the panel’s decision for reasons \narticulated by Judge Pillard in dissent).  \nBut I can take a hint. Unless and until the Supreme Court changes its preliminary views \nabout the Tucker Act, it would be a futile gesture to ignore the Court’s guidance in California and \nenter a preliminary injunction directing that NEH pay Plaintiffs’ their grants pendente lite because \nthe Government is obligated to make those payments. If Plaintiffs whose grants were terminated \n(or those representing their interests) really want a court to order that, “Defendants and their agents \ntake all steps necessary to ensure that the National Endowment for the Humanities disburses funds \non covered grants in the customary manner and in customary timeframes,” (Dkt. Nos. 65, at 1-2; \n65-2, at 2), it would appear to me that they need to seek relief in the Court of Federal Claims. I \ncertainly think it is likely that the Supreme Court will so conclude.  \nBut that does not mean that the Court lacks any jurisdiction over the Grant Termination \nclaims. The Grant Termination Plaintiffs seek both equitable and monetary relief. In Bowen the \nSupreme Court permitted the district court to award relief that specifically did not “order [the at-\nissue] amount to be paid,” and that “did not purport to be based on a finding that the Federal \nGovernment owed [Plaintiffs] that amount, or indeed, any amount of money.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at \n909-10. Instead, the relief in Bowen consisted of telling the Government that it “may not disallow \nthe reimbursement on the grounds given.” Id. at 910.  \nIt thus appears to me that I have the power to tell the Government that it “may not terminate \nthe grants on the grounds given.” Indeed, I am required by my office to do exactly that:  to “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right,” or “in \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 50 of 82\n \nexcess of statutory jurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.” 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(B)-(C). \nIn this case, alternative relief of the sort authorized in Bowen is available to remedy any \nadjudicated violation of the Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights – relief that does not involve the \npayment of money or even a finding that the Government owes money. That, of course, is an \ninjunction setting aside any illegal grant terminations until such time as the Government conducts \nnew termination process (if it chooses to go that route) in a constitutionally compliant manner. Put \notherwise, I have to power to enter an order mandating that, if the Government wants to consider \nterminating all the grants issued by the Biden Administration, or grants that focus on particular \nsubjects, they do so in a manner that complies with the law – and not for those reasons (assuming, \nof course, that those reasons violate the law – which will be discussed below). If Plaintiffs satisfy \nthe standards for entry of an injunction on that basis, that seems to me a logical way to redress any \nviolations of the Constitution, the APA or any other statute on which Plaintiffs rely. \nWere Defendants’ view of the limitations on this Court’s jurisdiction correct, it would \neffectively eliminate Plaintiffs’ ability to obtain any remedy for the violation of their constitutional \nand statutory rights, as alleged in the pleadings. This is particularly relevant in this case where we, \nunlike  in  California,  are  faced  with  constitutional  claims  as  well  as APA  claims  based  on \nDefendants’ alleged violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. \n“The Tucker Act does not itself provide the substantive cause of action; in order to come \nwithin the jurisdictional reach and the waiver of the Tucker Act, a plaintiff must identify a separate \nsource of substantive law that creates the right to money damages.” Samuels v. New York Dep’t of \nLab., 2025 WL 27737, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 3, 2025) (internal citations omitted). “In the parlance \nof Tucker Act cases, that source must be ‘money-mandating’.” Id. Against this backdrop of \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 51 of 82\n \nplaintiffs’ needing to identify a “money-mandating” source of law to bring a claim within the \njurisdiction of the Court of Federal Claims, the Federal Circuit has held seeking vindication for a \nviolation of constitutional rights, which Plaintiffs seek here, “cannot be so interpreted to command \nthe  payment  of  money,”  United  States  v.  Connolly,  716  F.2d  882,  887  (Fed.  Cir.  1983). \nConstitutional principles like “The separation of powers doctrine does not man-date [sic] payment \nof money by the government and thus cannot confer jurisdiction upon the Court of Federal \nClaims,” Jaye v. United States, 781 F. App'x 994, 997-98 (Fed. Cir. 2019) (internal citations \nomitted). \nOn this basis, the D.C. Circuit has “categorically reject[ed] the suggestion that a federal \ndistrict court can be deprived of jurisdiction by the Tucker Act when no jurisdiction lies in the \nCourt of Federal Claims.” Tootle v. Sec’y of Navy, 446 F.3d 167, 176 (D.C. Cir. 2006). As the Ninth \nCircuit recently emphasized in a similar case, “The result requested by the Government would \nmean that no court has jurisdiction to hear plaintiffs’ claims . . . [and is] contrary to common \nsense.” Cmty. Legal Servs., 137 F.4th 932, at * 9 (9th Cir. 2025) (emphasis added). \nFor the aforementioned reasons, I conclude that the Tucker Act does not deprive me of \njurisdiction to hear the Grant Termination Claims. Whether Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \nmerits of those claims is another question entirely. But they cannot be dismissed on jurisdictional \ngrounds.  \nd.  The Motion to Dismiss \nFor  the  reasons  articulated  in  the  section  above,  Defendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss  is \nGRANTED with respect to the following claims: \n•  For lack of standing – ACLS Counts I, II, III, V, VI, VII \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 52 of 82\n \n•  For lack of ripeness – ACLS Counts I, II, IV; AG Counts II (as it relates to the \nImpoundment Control Act); III; IV \nThe Government’s Motion to Dismiss is DENIED with respect to the following claims: \n•  ACLS Counts VIII, IX \n•  AG Counts I, II (except as it relates to the Impoundment Control Act), V, VI \nWith that done, we turn to the Motions for a Preliminary Injunction. \nII.  Plaintiffs’ Motions for Preliminary Injunctions15 \nA preliminary injunction is “an extraordinary remedy, which may only be awarded upon a \nclear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” Winter v. NRDC, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 \n(2008). To succeed on an application for a preliminary injunction, the moving party must show: \n(i) a likelihood of success on the merits; (ii) that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm absent a \npreliminary injunction; (iii) a favorable balance of hardships, and (iv) that a preliminary injunction \nis in the public interest. Id. at 20. \nPlaintiffs  who  are  seeking  a  mandatory  injunction  that  requires  defendants  to  act \naffirmatively face a higher burden still. “A mandatory preliminary injunction should issue only \nupon a clear showing that the moving party is entitled to the relief requested, or where extreme or \nvery serious damage will result from a denial of preliminary relief.” Cacchillo v. Insmed, Inc., 638 \nF.3d 401, 406 (2d Cir. 2011) (internal citations omitted). \n \n15 While Count I in the Authors Guild Amended Complaint (violation of the APA for arbitrary and capricious action, \nas opposed to Count II, which relies on violation of law) remains in this case, I do not rely on that claim in issuing a \npreliminary injunction. That claim is virtually identical to the claim underlying Judge Joun’s preliminary injunction \nthat was stayed in California, and as I previously stated, I do not intend to enter relief of the kind entered in that case \n– although it does not appear that Judge Joun (who was, after all, issuing the most preliminary of order, a TRO – not \neven a preliminary injunction) was focused on the possibility of alternative remedies. See Section I(c), supra. \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 53 of 82\n \nFor the below reasons, the Authors Guild Plaintiffs’ Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is \nGRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART. The ACLS Plaintiffs’ more limited Motion for a \nPreliminary Injunction is DENIED because, after dismissing the majority of the ACLS Plaintiffs’ \nclaims on jurisdictional grounds, their Motion for a Preliminary Injunction rests only on their claim \nthat DOGE acted beyond its authority; the ACLS Plaintiffs specifically did not seek the injunction \non their First Amendment claims. (See Dkt. No. 86, at 3-4) (saying that a chart “summariz[ing] the \nclaims pursued by each plaintiff group in seeking a preliminary injunction,” which did not include \neither ACLS First Amendment claim, “does not include claims in the complaint for which plaintiffs \nare not seeking an injunction.”  \na.  Likelihood of Success on the Merits \nOn the existing record, the Authors Guild Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they are likely \nto succeed on the merits of their claims that the Mass Terminations violate the First Amendment, \nand therefore the APA. However, neither they nor the ACLS Plaintiffs have demonstrated that they \nare likely to succeed on the merits of their claims that DOGE’s actions in connection with the Mass \nTerminations are ultra vires at this stage in the proceedings. Since the ACLS Plaintiffs’ motion for \npreliminary relief rests solely on the “DOGE” claim, the motion must be denied. \ni.  First Amendment  \nCount II of the Authors Guild Amended Complaint16 alleges that Defendants acted contrary \nto law “by terminating Plaintiffs’ and class members’ grants based, at least in part, on Defendants’ \nbelief that the supported works promoted disfavored viewpoints and Plaintiffs’ and class members’ \nmere association, through the grant process, with the prior presidential administration,” which \nunconstitutional action violates the APA. Am. Compl. ¶ 161. Count V of the Authors Guild \n \n16 Other aspects of Count II – specifically as it relates to the Impoundment Control Act – were dismissed on ripeness \ngrounds. See Section I(b), supra. \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 54 of 82\n \nAmended  Complaint  relies  directly  on  the  First Amendment,  alleging  that  Plaintiffs’  First \nAmendment rights have been violated by “Defendants’ viewpoint discrimination and the burden \nDefendants’ actions place on Plaintiffs’ exercise of First Amendment rights.” Am. Compl. ¶ 182. \nSpecifically, the Authors Guild Plaintiffs assert that: \nDefendants’ termination of nearly all NEH grants awarded during the prior Administration, \nand leaving in place existing and future grants that align with particular political and \nideological viewpoints, is “the product of invidious viewpoint discrimination.” Finley, 524 \nU.S. at 587.  \n \n[(i)] Defendants terminated the grants based on the recipients’ perceived viewpoint, in an \neffort to drive such views out of the marketplace of ideas. This is most evident by the \ncitation in the Termination Notices to executive orders purporting to combat “Radical \nIndoctrination” and “Radical … DEI Programs,” and to further “Biological Truth.” It is \nevident from the Termination Notice that Defendants believe Plaintiffs’ speech conflicts \nwith the Administration’s views [on certain subjects], and their grants were terminated at \nleast in part for this reason.  \n \n[(ii)] Defendants concluded Plaintiffs’ speech conflicts with the Administration’s views not \nbased  on  any  individual  analysis  of  particular  grants  but  based  on  Plaintiffs’  mere \nassociation with the prior administration through the grant award process. Defendants’ \ntermination of grants therefore burdens Plaintiffs’ exercise of their expressive association \nrights by creating conditions for federal funding that preclude individuals and organizations \nassociated—no matter how minimally—with individuals and organizations whose speech \nDefendants disfavor. \n \n(Id. ¶ 181). I interpret this as alleging both that the grants were selected for termination because \nthe  projects  they  funded  were  perceived  as  engaging  in  speech  disfavored  by  the  current \nAdministration and because the funding was awarded by the prior Administration.   \nThe First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that “Congress shall make \nno law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. CONST. amend. I. At its core, “the First \nAmendment means that government has no power to restrict expression because of its message, \nits ideas, its subject matter, or its content.” Police Dep’t of Chi. v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95 (1972). \nFirst Amendment violations can come in many forms. While the First Amendment can \ncertainly be used to curtail the Government’s straightforward criminalization of speech, see Texas \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 55 of 82\n \nv. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), courts have not hesitated to hold that the Government is also \nprevented “from doing indirectly what it cannot do directly.” EklecCo NewCo LLC v. Town of \nClarkstown, 2019 WL 2210798, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. May 21, 2019) (citing U.S. v. Oliveras, 905 F.2d \n623, 628 n.8 (2d Cir. 1990)). \nWith respect to the First Amendment’s application to the facts of this case, Plaintiffs rely \nheavily on language from the 1998 Supreme Court decision, Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. \nFinley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998). In Finley, the Supreme Court upheld, against a facial First \nAmendment challenge, the so-called “Williams/Coleman” amendment to the enabling statute of \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, which directed the Chairperson, in establishing procedures \nto judge the artistic merit of grant applications, to “take into consideration general standards of \ndecency and respect for the diverse beliefs and values of the American public.” Id. at 576. In \nupholding the amendment, the Court emphasized that “the ‘decency and respect’ criteria do not \nsilence speakers by expressly threatening censorship of ideas,” and that “the considerations that \nthe  provision  introduces,  by  their  nature,  do  not  engender  the  kind  of  directed  viewpoint \ndiscrimination that would prompt this Court to invalidate the statute on its face.” Id. at 583 (internal \nquotations  omitted).  Since  the Williams/Coleman  amendment  was  not  facing  an  as-applied \nchallenge, the Court specified that it had “no occasion here to address an as-applied challenge in a \nsituation where the denial of a grant may be shown to be the product of invidious viewpoint \ndiscrimination.” Id. at 587. However, the Court was clear in articulating that “even in the provision \nof subsidies, the Government may not ‘aim at the suppression of dangerous ideas,’” id. (quoting \nRegan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 550 (1983)), and that “If the NEA \nwere to leverage its power to award subsidies on the basis of subjective criteria into a penalty on \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 56 of 82\n \ndisfavored viewpoints, then we would confront a different case,” id. Plaintiffs claim that such a \ncase has arisen. \nPlaintiffs argue that Defendants violated their First Amendment rights by withdrawing \nfunding that had previously been awarded to projects because they concluded that those projects \npromoted or were associated with viewpoints they disfavor. (Dkt. No. 65-1, at 19). Specifically, \nPlaintiffs claim that Defendants terminated the NEH grants “not based on a reassessment of their \ncontributions to the humanities,” but “on their perceived viewpoints and associations.” (Dkt. No. \n65-1, at 19).  \nThere is certainly evidence to support that assertion. The Declaration of “Richard Roe” – \na pseudonymous declarant who claims to be a current employee at NEH – states that, in early \nFebruary 2025, NEH staff was informed that the Trump Administration “was planning to terminate \ngrants made during the Biden Administration that violated the President Trump’s Executive Orders \non  K-12  education,  gender  ideology,  and  DEI.”  (Dkt.  No.  30  ¶  1).  Chairman  McDonald’s \ndeclaration in the parallel case in the Northern District of California largely corroborates Roe’s \ntestimony. McDonald states that “Between January 20 and February 7, 2025, Chair [Shelly C.] \nLowe directed NEH program staff to review open grants in light of the new Executive Orders.” \nN.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration ¶ 7.17 McDonald further explains that, “the policy for selecting \ngrants for termination at NEH focused first on first on [sic] identifying open grants that focused \non or promoted (in whole or in part) ‘environmental justice,’ ‘diversity, equity, and inclusion’ or \n‘diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,’ and “gender ideology.’” Id. ¶ 20. He adds that, \n“Subsequently, and in consultation with DOGE, I more broadly chose grants for termination that \n \n17 McDonald also submitted a declaration in this case, but its description of the grant termination process is limited \nto a single sentence:  “I terminated a number of, but not all, open NEH grants in April 2025, in compliance with \nPresidential Executive Order 14222 and in consultation with the Department of Government Efficiency.” (Dkt. No. \n80, at 4). As evidence goes, this is manifestly insufficient to prove anything.  \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 57 of 82\n \ndid not contribute to the public’s confidence in how NEH expended its taxpayer funds as required \nby NEH’s authorizing statute.” Id. ¶ 21.  \nThe N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration includes an attached email from Brett Bobley \n(NEH’s Chief Information Officer) to NEH Senior Management and Division Directors. The email \nsets out “the review criteria for reviewing all the awards from 2021 to the present: As per OMB’s \nJanuary 27, 2025 memo (M-25-13), please identify any funded projects that ‘advance Marxist \nequity,  transgenderism,  or  green  new  deal  social  engineering  policies.’  More  specifically, \nfollowing the descriptions provided in the Administration’s recent Executive Orders, you should \nidentify grants that focus on or promote (in whole or in part): (i) ‘environmental justice’; (ii) \n‘diversity, equity, and inclusion ‘ or ‘diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility’ (even if these \nexact terms are not used); and (iii) ‘gender ideology,’ which, according to the Executive Order, \nreplaces sex with ‘an internal, fluid, and subjective sense of self unmoored from biological facts’ \nor  with  ‘an  ever-shifting  concept  of  self-assessed  gender  identity.’”  N.D.  Cal.  McDonald \nDeclaration, at 5. \nThe Declaration includes another attached email from Adam Wolfson (NEH Assistant \nChairman for Programs) to two DOGE employees, saying, “I've copied below the link for the \naward spreadsheet created by Brett that the program directors used for their historical review \nof NEH’s grants since January 2021. It’s broken down by program office, each one having its own \ntab. The directors reviewed the grants made through their office and entered comments for the \nthree relevant categories (i.e., DEI/DEIA; gender ideology; and environmental justice) and rated \nthem based on level of involvement with any of the categories (high, medium, low, N/A).” Id., at \n7.  \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 58 of 82\n \nThis narrative is corroborated by the NEH’s April 24, 2025 Press Release, saying, “NEH \nhas cancelled awards that are at variance with agency priorities, including but not limited to those \non diversity, equity, and inclusion (or DEI) and environmental justice, as well as awards that may \nnot inspire public confidence in the use of taxpayer funds.” Press Release, NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR \nTHE HUMANITIES, An Update on NEH Funding Priorities and the Agency’s Recent Implementation \nof Trump Administration Executive Orders (Apr. 24, 2025), https://www.neh.gov/news/update-\nneh-funding-priorities-and-agencys-recent-implementation-trump-administration-executive. \n“[E]ven though a person has no ‘right’ to a valuable governmental benefit and even though \nthe government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon \nwhich the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes \nhis constitutionally protected interests -- especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the \ngovernment could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or \nassociations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would \nallow the government to ‘produce a result which [it] could not command directly.’” Perry v. \nSindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972) (quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 526). \n  The process that Chairman McDonald describes for canceling the grants is a textbook \nviolation of the kind described in Perry. McDonald straightforwardly admits that grants were \nterminated, not because the Plaintiffs’ proposals were unworthy of NEH funding or reflected \nundistinguished scholarship, but because the matters they proposed to study ran afoul of the current \nAdministration’s beliefs or preferences. That is clear from the direction given to the NEH staff \nmembers,  who  were  told  to  identify  grants  that  purportedly  advanced  “Marxist  equity, \ntransgenderism, or green new deal social engineering policies,” N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration, \nat 5, or that “focused on or promoted (in whole or in part) ‘environmental justice,’ ‘diversity, \n58 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 59 of 82\n \nequity, and inclusion’ or ‘diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility,’ and “gender ideology,’” id. \n¶ 20.   \nThe fact that this case involves the termination of grants already awarded, as opposed to \nthe awarding of funding in the first place, renders the First Amendment viewpoint discrimination \nall the more transparent. The awards that were terminated had been made in conformity with a \nlong-standing review process that was conducted pursuant to settled rules and procedures. The \nrecord discloses that everyone who was awarded funding from the NEH prior to the spring of 2025 \nemerged from a stringent vetting process that was conducted by experts in their respective fields. \nGrantees were chosen because of the rigor of their scholarship for inclusion in the “notable list” of \n“thousands of our nation’s most significant humanities projects” that have been underwritten by \nthe NEH over the past 50 years.” (Dkt. No. 71-1, at 1). The already-allocated money was then \nperemptorily withdrawn because the new Administration was hostile to particular topics of study \nand points of view. It was withdrawn on this basis simultaneously, from literally hundreds of grant \nrecipients, “eschew[ing] the expert-guided process by which NEH typically acts.” Am. Compl. ¶ \n151.  \nCompounding the transparency of the unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination is the fact \nthat the NEH’s Authorizing Statute specifically requires the agency to activities that “reach or \nreflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage, including the culture of, a \nminority, inner city, rural, or tribal community.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(c)(4). Yet defunding projects that \nreferenced diversity, and minority/tribal culture – areas of study that the NEH was statutorily \n59 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 60 of 82\n \nrequired to support – was one of the primary drivers of the Mass Termination.18  \nThere is also ample evidence that the terminations were motivated by a different but equally \npernicious type of viewpoint discrimination – namely, associational viewpoint discrimination \nagainst grants that were awarded to scholars during the Biden Administration. Here, too, Plaintiffs \nhave demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of a First Amendment claim.  \nThe Elrod/Branti line of Supreme Court cases has made clear that the Government’s \nwithdrawal of a benefit because of the recipient’s association with a political party is limited by \nthe First Amendment. See Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976); Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 \n(1980). The current NEH employee writing under the name Richard Roe attests that after “The \n[NEH] staff spent weeks combing through thousands of grants and indicating which ones might \nbe considered in violation of the new Eos . . . [they] estimated that roughly 25% of grants were in \nviolation of the new EOs and would likely be terminated. (Dkt. No. 30 ¶ 1). Nonetheless, almost \nall Biden-era NEH grants were canceled. Another declarant, current or former NEH employee \nMark Moe, claimed that, at an April 30, 2025 staff meeting, Acting Chairman McDonald told staff \nthat DOGE was focused on terminating awards issued by the Biden administration. (Dkt. No. 50 \n¶ 2). This is further corroborated by the email referenced above, in which Brett Bobley notes that \nthe NEH grant review was structured around “all the awards from 2021 to the present,” N.D. Cal. \nMcDonald Declaration, at 6, and Adam Wolfson describes the “historical review of NEH’s grants \nsince January 2021,” id., at 7. It is no coincident that January 2021 was the month in which \nPresident Biden took office following the 2020 Election.  \n \n18 Ironically, the E.O. that was mistakenly referenced in the Mass Termination Notices specifically speaks to the \ntermination of “non-statutory components and functions”. Executive Order 14217, Commencing the Reduction of the \nFederal Bureaucracy, issued on March 14, 2025 \n \n60 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 61 of 82\n \nIf Roe’s testimony is correct – and I have no reason to disbelieve it, since the Government \noffered not a scintilla of evidence to suggest that animosity to the previous Administration’s actions \nwas not a principal driver of the Mass Termination – then the vast majority of grants terminated \nwere defunded simply because they were awarded by the Democratic administration – a reason \nthat blatantly conflicts with First Amendment principles.  \nDefendants counter by asserting the general principal that the Government’s “decision not \nto subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right.” Rust v. Sullivan, 500 \nU.S. 173, 193 (1991). The case on which they rely, Rust, involved a facial challenge to regulations \npromulgated under Title X of the Public Health Service Act, Section 1008 of which provides that \n“none of the funds appropriated under this subchapter shall be used in programs where abortion is \na  method  of  family  planning.”  42  U.S.C.  §  300a-6. The  Rust  petitioners  claimed  that  the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services regulations under this statute – a statute specifying that \nTitle X projects (i) may not provide abortion counseling or referrals; (ii) may not advocate for \nabortion; and (iii) must be physically and financially separate from prohibited abortion activities \n– constituted facial violations of the First Amendment rights of health care providers and women. \nThe  Court  disagreed,  reasoning  that  Congress  had  not  discriminated  against  viewpoints  on \nabortion, but had “merely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other.” Rust, 500 U.S. \nat 193.  \nHowever, the Court subsequently “explained Rust” by noting that “the counseling activities \nof the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech.” Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, \n531 U.S. 533, 541 (2001). The distinction between governmental speech and private speech \nallowed the Court to distinguish between viewpoint-based funding decisions that can be sustained \n– when the Government is itself the speaker or is using private speakers to transmit information \n61 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 62 of 82\n \npertaining to its own program – and funding decisions but that cannot be sustained if the \nGovernment program is “designed to facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental \nmessage.” Id. at 541-42 (emphasis added). As the Court previously established in Rosenberger v. \nRector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819 (1995), “it does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based \nrestrictions are proper when the [Government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a \nmessage it favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private \nspeakers.” Id. at 834. That, of course, is precisely what the NEH does – expends funds to encourage \na diversity of views (as statutorily mandated) from private speakers – speaker who are not \ndelivering a message either for or from the Government.  \nThere can be no question that the speech at issue in this case is private, not governmental \nspeech. To determine whether contested speech is governmental or private, the Supreme Court has \nidentified  three  primary  factors:  (1) whether  the  medium  has  historically  been  used  to \n“communicate[] messages from the States”; (2) whether the medium is “often closely identified in \nthe public mind with the State,” i.e., whether it is reasonably interpreted as “conveying some \nmessage  on  the  [Government’s]  behalf”;  and  (3) whether  the  government  maintains  direct, \neditorial control over the message’s content. Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, \nInc., 576 U.S. 200, 210-13, 219 (2015) (internal quotations and alterations omitted). None of these \nfactors weighs in favor of finding the scholarly work in the humanities disciplines that is produced \nwith the help of NEH grants to be governmental speech. The Government has not historically used \nindependently published books about issues such as “philosophical consequences of the scientific \nworldview,” (Dkt. No. 71, at 1), or “the entanglement of beauty work, racialized labor, and Black \nwomanhood,” (Dkt. No. 73, at 1) to communicate a message; the public does not closely associate \nsuch works with the Government; and with the exception of terms and conditions in the grant \n62 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 63 of 82\n \nagreements requiring NEH grant-holders to seek approval before making changes to their project \nscope, the Government cannot be said to maintain “direct, editorial control” over the content of \nthe NEH grantees’ work product. Indeed, the authorizing statute prohibits it from “exercise[ing] \nany direction, supervision or control of the policy determination, personnel, or curriculum” of any \ngrantee organization. 20 USC § 953(c). \n  Defendants further insist that their actions do not reflect viewpoint discrimination but \nrather a re-prioritizing the NEH’s focus on awarding grants to projects that “focus on topics in \nAmerican history, culture, and government in any period from the Colonial Era to the present that \nincrease public knowledge of the 250th anniversary of American Independence and American \nexceptionalism.” NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, Funding Opportunity for Individuals \n–  Public  Scholars,  https://www.neh.gov/grants/research/public-scholar-program  (last  accessed \nJuly 14, 2025). But that statement is manifestly false. To illustrate the point, we need only consider \nthe grant taken away from one of the named plaintiffs in Authors Guild – Benjamin Holtzman.  \nDr. Holtzman is a Professor of History at Lehman College in New York City. He studies \nthe intersection of political and social history in the United States, with particular focus on politics, \ncapitalism, race and class, cities, and social movements. Am. Compl. ¶ 17. In other words, he \nstudies American history from a particular point of view, one that takes a hard look at some of the \nless inspiring aspects of the 250-year journey we will commemorate next year. The book he is \nwriting – the one that would have been subsidized by his NEH grant – focuses on something that \nreally happened in recent American history: the re-emergence of racist extremist groups, including \nthe Ku Klux Klan, during the 1970s and 1980s. Id. ¶ 18. So his project fell comfortably within the \nNEH’s new “focus on topics in American history…. from the Colonial Era to the present….” \n63 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 64 of 82\n \nNonetheless, Holtzmann’s grant was terminated. The evidence suggests that this occurred \nsolely and simply as part of an effort to eliminate NEH funding for projects that focus on historical, \nliterary or cultural issues that the current administration finds unpalatable. We do not need to guess \nto reach this conclusion: In the Government’s spreadsheet entitled “Copy of NEH Active Grants \n(03.28.2025),19 Professor Holtzman’s grant was flagged for a connection to DEI through a “Yes” \nhaving been entered into a column labeled, “Yes / No DEI?” In the subsequent column titled “DEI \nRationale,” the spreadsheet says, “This book project explores the grassroots activist network that \nchallenged white power in the late 20th century US, highlighting diverse groups joining forces to \nchallenge white supremacists and transform understandings of racism.”  \nThe spreadsheets reveal that numerous other grants having to do with American history – \nthe ostensible new focus of NEH funding – were terminated, at least in part, for their connection \nto DEI-related topics. Examples include:  (i) an award to LaClaire Mizell, of the Dorchester \nHeritage Center, Inc., to fund an exhibit about the history of indigenous tribes in South Carolina, \nwhich was flagged in the above spreadsheet because, “Dorchester Heritage Center’s collaboration \nwith local Native American tribes and scholars in designing an exhibit, prioritizing accurate \ninformation and the tribes’ storytelling preferences, aligns with DEI principles”; (ii) an award to \nJoseph Dorman, of the Foundation for Excellence in Louisiana Public Broadcasting, to create a \ndocumentary about the Reconstruction-era Colfax Massacre of Black Americans, which the same \nspreadsheet describes as “explor[ing] a historical event that significantly impacted Black civil \nrights, making it relevant to the topic of DEI”; and (iii) an award to Stephanie Halpern, of the \nYIVO Institute for Jewish Research, to process and digitize records of labor unions that were \nfounded in large part by Jewish American immigrants, which was flagged in the spreadsheet \n \n19 This document appears to correspond to the spreadsheet referenced at N.D. Cal. McDonald Declaration ¶¶ 16-17. \n64 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 65 of 82\n \nbecause, “These collections represent Jewish labor unions that fought for workers’ rights, showing \nthe intersection of Jewish immigrant experiences and labor movements.” The Termination Notices \nthat alerted these grant recipients to the loss of their funding stated that the only reason why these \ngrants were being terminated is the reason indicated by the record evidence – the nature of the \nspeech being subsidized. \nFar be it from this Court to deny the right of the Administration to focus NEH priorities on \nAmerican history and exceptionalism as the year of our semiquincentennial approaches. Such \nrefocusing is ordinarily a matter of agency discretion. But agency discretion does not include \ndiscretion to violate the First Amendment. Nor does not give the Government the right to edit \nhistory. Adopting a singular view about American history or American exceptionalism when \nawarding (or terminating the award of) public funds – while excluding whole aspects of that history \nsolely  because  they  relate  to  the  ostensibly  “divisive”  topics  of  “diversity”  or  “equity”  or \n“inclusion,” see, e.g., Executive Order 14151, Ending Radical And Wasteful Government DEI \nPrograms and Preferencing, issued on January 20, 2025, – is a patent violation of the First \nAmendment.   \nIn short, the Government cannot take away monies previously allocated in an effort to \nsanitize from our history matters that do not conform to some preferred, triumphalist version of \nthe past. It cannot muzzle the dissemination of “accurate information” about the indigenous North \nAmerican peoples, deemphasize or ignore historical events that “significantly impacted Black civil \nrights,” or cast aside narratives that “show[] the intersection of Jewish immigrant experiences and \nlabor movements” by removing funding for projects that explore such issues – certainly not on the \nbasis that such things are not part of the 250-year history we plan to celebrate next year. Yet the \n65 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 66 of 82\n \nevidence in the record demonstrates beyond peradventure that this is precisely what occurred at \nthe NEH. \nNeither can the Government assert that such matters do not live up to taxpayer expectations \nabout the expenditure of Government funds because such matters are “divisive” and so do not \naccord with taxpayer expectations about how Government funds should be spent. The statute is \nclear and unambiguous: Congress explicitly directed the NEH to support and subsidize activities \nthat “reach or reflect the diversity and richness of our American cultural heritage, including the \nculture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(c)(4). Congress has \nnot repealed that statute, and the Government has no more right to violate that authorizing statute \nthan it does to edit history. The very fact that it is violating the authorizing statute by acting in this \nmanner brings the constitutional violation into stark relief.   \nThe official motto of the United States of American is E pluribus unum – out of many, one. \nOut of many peoples, from many backgrounds, holding many different viewpoints, one nation. \nConcepts that were deemed anathema for purposes of the Mass Termination – concepts like \ndiversity (out of many), and inclusion (one nation) – are literally written into that motto. The \nAmerican story simply cannot be told by suppressing all conversation about such matters – \nincluding especially conversation about past injustices that some, perhaps many, of us would rather \nforget. But for well over two centuries Americans have shown, again and again, that we can take \na hard look at ourselves without falling apart. Indeed, not a few Americans believe that the most \nexceptional thing about this great country is the fact that we do not forget those things, but explore \nthem and learn from them – even as we march ever onward toward the day when Jefferson’s stirring \ncreedal words “all men are created equal” can finally be said to be true. We are exceptional because \nthe First Amendment prohibits our Government from acting, directly or indirectly, to control \n66 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 67 of 82\n \nspeech even when the Government doesn’t agree with that speech. It ill behooves Defendants to \nundermine that critically important aspect of our exceptionalism.   \nFor these reasons, the Authors Guild Plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success \non  the  merits  of  their  claim for  preliminary  injunctive  relief  on  the  ground  that  the  Mass \nTermination was carried out in violation of the First Amendment.  \nii.  Administrative Procedure Act \nThe Authors Guild Plaintiff further assert that, if they are likely to succeed on the merits of \ntheir First Amendment claim as pleaded in Count V, they are also likely to succeed on the merits \nof their APA claim as pleaded in Count II. They are correct. A court of law is required to “hold \nunlawful and set aside agency action . . . found to be . . . contrary to constitutional right.” 5 U.S.C. \n§ 706(2)(B). If the Mass Terminations were unconstitutional, they necessarily violated the APA. \nTherefore, Plaintiffs have also demonstrated a likelihood of success on the merits of AG \nCount II. \niii.   Ultra Vires Actions Taken by DOGE \nIn addition to their claims predicated on violation of the First Amendment, Plaintiffs in \nboth actions allege that “DOGE’s termination of the grants was unconstitutional because DOGE \nhas no legal authority to terminate another agency’s grants.” (Dkt. No. 25, at 18). They argue that \nDOGE terminated the grants and that in so doing it acted ultra vires. As noted above, this is the \nonly ground on which the ACLS Plaintiffs have moved for preliminary relief that has not been \ndismissed on standing or ripeness grounds. \nPlaintiffs have not demonstrated a likelihood of success on this issue.  \nAn ultra vires claim is “essentially a Hail Mary pass – and in court as in football, the \nattempt rarely succeeds,” DCH Reg’l Med. Ctr. v. Azar, 925 F.3d 503, 509 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (internal \n67 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 68 of 82\n \ncitation omitted). “[A]n agency action allegedly ‘in excess of authority’ must not simply involve a \ndispute over statutory interpretation or challenged findings of fact.” Dart v. United States, 848 F.2d \n217, 231 (D.C. Cir. 1988). The agency must “plainly act[] in excess of its delegated powers and \ncontrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear and mandatory.” Yale New Haven Hosp. \nv. Becerra, 56 F.4th 9, 26-27 (2d Cir. 2022) (cleaned up). \nTo satisfy this rigorous standard, Plaintiffs must prove that Cavanaugh and Fox effectively \nusurped the legal authority to terminate grants that Congress had expressly conferred on the NEH \nChairperson.  \nThe statute creating NEH states that “The Chairperson, with the advice of the National \nCouncil on the Humanities…, is authorized to enter into arrangements, including contracts, grants, \nloans and, other forms of assistance” to carry out the agency’s humanities functions. See 20 U.S.C. \nSec 956(c). The statute does not contain any express language about who can terminate awards. It \nseems that the terms and conditions of the grants provide that they can only be terminated by the \nOffice of Grant Management, which is an office within the NEH. See NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE \nHUMANITIES,  General  Terms  and  Conditions  for  Awards  to  Organizations  (for  grants  and \ncooperative  agreements  issued  October 1, 2024, or later),  https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-\nand-conditions-grants-after-oct-2024; See also NAT’L ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES, General \nTerms and Conditions for Awards to Individuals (for awards with start dates January 1, 2025, or \nlater), https://www.neh.gov/general-terms-and-conditions-awards-individuals. DOGE, obviously, \nis not part of the NEH. Hence the ultra vires argument.  \nThe record evidence certainly indicates that persons associated with DOGE were involved \nin the Mass Termination. However, it does not indicate that DOGE did the terminating, or that the \nNEH was not involved. Acting NEH Chairman McDonald declares that he terminated the grants \n68 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 69 of 82\n \n“in consultation with [DOGE].” (Dkt. No. 80 ¶ 13). The anonymous declarations submitted by \nPlaintiffs are largely consistent with McDonald’s account. Their testimony is to the effect that \nMcDonald, Fox and Cavanaugh were all involved in the decision to terminate the grants of \nPlaintiffs and their members. (See Dkt. Nos. 30 ¶ 2; 31 ¶¶ 2-3; 32 ¶ 8). That the termination notices \nwere “shared outside of the agency’s grant management system,” (Dkt. No. 32 ¶ 14), and that the \nnotices were sent from a non-NEH email address, (see Dkt. No. 31 ¶ 3), is not inconsistent with \nMcDonald’s declaration that he made the final decision. And it is clear that NEH staff worked on \nthe project.  \nPlaintiffs do refer to a weblink to something called the “NEH SLT Meeting Recording,” \nwhich appears to be an unofficial recording of some type of meeting about which I know nothing. \nACLS Compl. ¶ 67 n.12. This recording could be of the April 3, 2025, meeting referenced in the \nJane Doe Declaration. (See Dkt. No. 32 ¶ 16), but I do not know that. In any event, to the extent \nthis video might advance Plaintiffs’ argument that DOGE did the dirty work here, I decline to enter \nthe extraordinary remedy of preliminary injunctive relief on the basis of a leaked video is either \nthe subject of anonymous testimony or no testimony at all – especially in view of the consistent \ntestimony from witnesses for both sides that McDonald was very much involved in the decision-\nmaking process.  \nPlaintiffs also submit a Supplemental Declaration from John Doe. (See Dkt. No. 110-1). \nDoe, a current or former employee at NEH, claims that he has personal knowledge that Defendant \nFox maintained his own spreadsheet showing which grants to terminate that was separate from the \nspreadsheets used at NEH to identify grants that were in conflict with the Administration’s \nExecutive Orders. (Id. ¶¶ 4-7). This, Doe asserts, demonstrates that Fox was operating outside the \n69 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 70 of 82\n \nstandard NEH review process. Fox also attests that Chairman McDonald “confirmed that it was \nDOGE, not him, that chose the grants to terminate.” (Id. ¶ 7).  \nUnfortunately for Plaintiffs, Doe’s anonymous testimony is not sufficiently persuasive to \nget them over the likelihood of success threshold. McDonald has declared under oath that he made \nthe final termination decisions; Roe’s anonymous suggestion to the contrary at most creates an \nissue of fact of the sort that normally preclude entry of a preliminary injunction.20  \nb.  Irreparable Harm \nDemonstrating irreparable harm is “the single most important prerequisite for the issuance \nof a preliminary injunction.” Faiveley Transp. Malmo AB v. Wabtec Corp., 559 F.3d 110, 118 (2d \nCir. 2009). “To satisfy their burden to show irreparable harm, plaintiffs must demonstrate that \nabsent a preliminary injunction they will suffer an injury that is neither remote nor speculative, but \nactual and imminent, and one that cannot be remedied if a court waits until the end of trial to \nresolve the harm.” JTH Tax, LLC v. Agnant, 62 F.4th 658, 672 (2d Cir. 2023).  \nThe  Plaintiffs  that  remain  in  this  case  have  adequately  demonstrated  that  they  face \nirreparable harm from the Defendants’ cancelation of their grants. Where, as here, plaintiffs have, \ninter alia, sufficiently alleged claims under the First Amendment, courts presume irreparable \nharm because  the  “loss  of First  Amendment freedoms,  for  even  minimal  periods  of  time, \nunquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” N.Y. Magazine v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 136 F.3d \n123, 127 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). See also Amaker v. \nFischer, 453 Fed.Appx. 59, 63 (2d Cir. 2011) (citing Bronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of Educ. of \n \n20 At some point, all of these anonymous witnesses are going to have to come forward so that the Court knows who \nthey are and how they came to have the information about which they attest – and, of course be subjected to cross \nexamination.  \n \n70 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 71 of 82\n \nCity of N.Y., 331 F.3d 342, 349 (2d Cir. 2003)) (“Where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or \nregulation that directly limits speech, the irreparable nature of the harm may be presumed”). \nFurther, the record is replete with evidence that the plaintiff grantees have experienced and \nwill continue to experience harm from the cancelation of their grants, and that such harm will not \nbe remediable by future monetary relief. Named plaintiffs have shown that the cancellation of their \ngrants has caused them to seek new employment after having been deprived of large percentages \nof  relied  upon  income  and  to  face  indefinite  postponement,  if  not  cancellation,  of  their \npublications, leading to serious reputational harm in fields that requires its academics to publish \nearly and often throughout their careers. (See Dkt. Nos. 27-29, 33-49, 51, 68-74). As Plaintiffs \nnoted  in  their  briefing,  numerous  other  courts  have  recently  found  that  analogous  grant \nterminations risk irreparable harm absent court intervention. See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits \nv. OMB, 763 F.Supp.3d 36, 57 (D.D.C. 2025); Massachusetts v. N.I.H., 2025 WL 702163, at *1, \n*31 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025); AIDS Vaccine Advoc. Coal. v. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 752378, at \n*19 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025); Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 893530, at *22–*23 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, \n2025). \nPlaintiffs have thus demonstrated an actual and imminent likelihood of irreparable harm \nthat satisfies this element of their preliminary injunction motions.  \nc.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nHaving established a likelihood of success on the merits and irreparable harm, Plaintiffs \nmust  finally  demonstrate  “that  the  balance  of  equities  tips  in  [their]  favor,”  and  that  \n“an  injunction  is  in  the  public  interest.” Sherley  v.  Sebelius,  644  F.3d  388,  392  (D.C.  Cir. \n2011) (quoting Winter, 555 U.S. at 20). However, “When the government is a party to the suit, our \n71 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 72 of 82\n \ninquiries into the public interest and the balance of the equities merge.” We the Patriots USA, Inc. \nv. Hochul, 17 F.4th 266, 295 (2d Cir. 2021). \nWhile Defendants counter that “the injunctions Plaintiffs seek would disrupt NEH’s efforts \nto implement the President’s directives while complying with the agency’s statutory obligations” \nand “would disrupt NEH’s lawful execution of that process,” (Dkt. No. 81, at 14), there is “no \npublic interest in the perpetuation of unlawful agency action.” See Planned Parenthood of N.Y. \nCity, Inc. v. United States HHS, 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018) There is, on the other \nhand, substantial public interest in “having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.” League of Women Voters of U.S. v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016). \nThe scholarship that NEH’s cancellations have imperiled includes works ranging from the \naforementioned book about the southern resistance to the Ku Klux Klan, written by Professor \nHoltzman, (see Dkt. No. 70), to the creation of public databases dedicated to preserving and \nensuring access to great works of art, a project of Professor Eric Hoyt at the University of \nWisconsin-Madison and Associate Professor Mattie Burkert at the University of Oregon, (see Dkt. \nNos. 38; 45). After extensive review, the NEH determined, and I have no reason to disagree, that \nthese works were among “our nation’s most significant humanities projects” and deserved to be \nadded to “this list of distinguished contributions to the humanities,” (see, e.g., NEH Offer Letters, \nDkt. Nos. 68-1; 69-1; 71-1; 72-1; 73-1), because each of these scholars had the potential to \ncontribute something great to his or her respective field and to our shared knowledge of America \nand the world. Then, seemingly without adequate administrative process and for reasons that are \nplausibly alleged to have infringed on the grantees’ First Amendment rights, the NEH reversed \ncourse, pulled funding, imperiling the prospect that these contributions to our understanding of \n72 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 73 of 82\n \nhistory, sociology, and literature, would not see the light of day. On these facts, the balance of \nequities and public interest tilt in favor of granting plaintiffs a preliminary injunction – to preserve \nthe possibility that we may yet get the opportunity to see what these scholars have to teach us. \nIII.  Preliminary Injunctive Relief \nHaving found that Authors Guild has sufficiently demonstrated irreparable harm and its \nlikelihood of success on the merits of its remaining APA claim and First Amendment claim, it is \nentitled to preliminary injunctive relief. What that relief can be is informed first and foremost by \nthe Supreme Court’s recent decision in Trump v. CASA, Inc.,     S. Ct.    , 2025 WL 1773631 (June \n27, 2025). \nIn CASA, the Supreme Court stayed three so-called “universal injunctions” that district \ncourt judges had issued to enjoin the implementation and enforcement of President Trump’s \nExecutive Order No. 14160, which purports to identify circumstances in which a person born in \nthe United States is not recognized as an American citizen. Id., at *4. The Court described these \nuniversal injunctions as “prohibit[ing] the enforcement of a law or policy against anyone,” which \nit held exceeded the court’s maximal authority to provide “complete relief to the plaintiffs before \nthe court.” Id., at ** 4, 11 (emphasis in original). \nSo, who is before the court today, and how broad of an injunction is necessary to provide \ncomplete relief to those individuals? Authors Guild claims to bring its action on behalf of, not just \nthe named plaintiffs whose grants were terminated, but two proposed classes. The first, the \n“Individual Grantee Class,” is defined as “All individual NEH grant recipients whose grants were \nterminated as part of the Mass Termination.” Am. Compl. ¶ 135. The second, the “Subrecipient \nClass,” is defined as “All NEH grant subrecipients whose sponsors’ grants were terminated as part \nof the Mass Termination.” Id. The question, then, is whether “complete relief” should be awarded \n73 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 74 of 82\n \nonly to named plaintiffs Authors Guild, William Goldstein, Elizabeth Kadetsky, Valerie Orlando, \nKatalin Balog, Benjamin Holtzman, Lee Jasperse, and Nicole Jenkins, or also to the “at least 1,400 \n[other] grantees” who received “the same Termination Notice between April 1 and April 3, 2025.” \nId. ¶ 6. \n“Whether the issues framed by the named parties before the court should be expanded to \nencompass the individual claims of additional class members is a matter of judicial administration \nthat should be decided in the first instance by the District Court.” Cooper v. Fed. Res. Bank, 467 \nU.S. 867, 881 (1984). While CASA did away with district courts’ ability to issue universal \ninjunctions that enjoin a defendant’s actions against anyone, the class-wide relief that Plaintiffs are \nseeking in this case appears to have been largely blessed by the Court’s majority opinion. The \nopinion emphasizes that unlike universal injunctions, class actions have a “founding-era forebear” \nin the historical bill of peace, which “involved a group [that] was small and cohesive, and the suit \ndid not resolve a question of legal interpretation for the entire realm.” CASA, 2025 WL 1773631, \nat *9. Likewise, Justice Kavanaugh’s concurring opinion explained that “To be sure, in the wake \nof the Court’s decision, plaintiffs who challenge the legality of a new federal statute or executive \naction and request preliminary injunctive relief may sometimes seek to proceed by class action \nunder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2) and ask a court to award preliminary classwide \nrelief  that  may,  for  example,  be  statewide,  regionwide,  or  even  nationwide.”  Id.,  at  *19 \n(Kavanaugh,  J.  concurring).  CASA’s  recency  means  that  the  permissible  contours  of  such \n“preliminary classwide relief” and “whether a narrower [than universal] injunction is appropriate” \nremains for district court judges to decide “in the first instance.” Id., at *3. \n74 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 75 of 82\n \nSo, must the Authors Guild classes must be formally certified before we can grant \npreliminary relief to the putative class members pending further proceedings? The answer is no. \nWe are so informed by yet another of the Supreme Court’s recent decisions from this term.  \nIn A. A. R. P. v. Trump, 145 S. Ct. 1364 (2025), the Court granted an application for an \ninjunction pendente lite brought by members of a putative class of detainees who faced an \nimminent threat of irreparable harm to their constitutional rights. Id., at 1367. The Court’s grant of \ninjunctive relief to the putative class-members came after the District Court had denied class \ncertification “as to the detainees’ underlying habeas claims challenging the validity of removal \nunder the AEA.” Id. at 1369 n.1. While the Court dismissed the import of the District Court’s \ndenial of class certification because, “in any event, the District Court’s order primarily addressed \nthe detainees’ ability to challenge the validity of AEA removal on a classwide basis,” while “The \napplication before this Court seeks only to vindicate notice rights on a classwide basis,” id., Justice \nAlito’s dissent emphasized his objection to the Court’s issuance of “‘preliminary relief’ to a \nputative class that the District Court has explicitly refused to certify . . . without providing any \nsubstantive analysis suggesting that the District Court's analysis of the class certification issue was \nincorrect.” Id., at 1377. The majority opinion’s response to Justice Alito explicitly addressed how \nthe Court views the intersection of necessarily quick and responsive preliminary relief with the \ndeliberative and fact-intensive class certification process: \nDistrict courts should approach requests for preliminary relief with care and consideration, \nbut  exigent  circumstances  may  impose  practical  constraints.  Preliminary  relief  is \ncustomarily granted on the basis of procedures that are less formal and evidence that is less \ncomplete than in a trial on the merits. The purpose of such relief is merely to preserve the \nrelative positions of the parties pending further proceedings. \n. . . \nAnd because courts may issue temporary relief to a putative class, we need not decide \nwhether a class should be certified as to the detainees’ due process claims in order to \ntemporarily enjoin the Government from removing putative class members while the \nquestion of what notice is due is adjudicated. \n75 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 76 of 82\n \n \nId., at 1368–69 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).  \nThere is no reason for me to assume that the Court in CASA intended to walk back a \npronouncement it made the previous month in A.A.R.P. In fact, CASA’s emphasis on the distinction \nbetween equitable relief that historically applied to “a group [that] was small and cohesive,” and \nuniversal injunctions, which resolved “a question of legal interpretation for the entire realm,” \ncounsels us that limited preliminary relief for a purported but still defined class of individuals is \nnot the type of relief “prohibit[ing] the enforcement of a law or policy against anyone,” to which \nthe decision in CASA applied. CASA, 2025 WL 1773631, at ** 4, 9. \n  Therefore,  preliminary  injunctive  relief  that  relates  solely  to  the  pleaded  classes  – \nconsisting only of individual grant recipients and sub-recipients who received grant termination \nnotices as part of a Mass Termination at NEH that appears to have been conducted in a manner \nthat violates the First Amendment – is not “broader than necessary to provide complete relief to \neach plaintiff with standing to sue.” Id., at *15.  \nCASA was decided after briefing closed on the original motion, so I reopened it to give the \nparties an opportunity to explain how the decision impacted my ability to issue relief in this case. \n(See Dkt. No. 105). In its response, Authors Guild argued that CASA endorsed district courts’ \nability  to  provide  class-wide  relief,  and  explained  why  its  class-members  were  entitled  to \npreliminary relief. Specifically, it argued that the members of the proposed classes would likely \nsatisfy the Rule 23(a) requirements of (i) numerosity – with over 1,400 grantees impacted by the \nunconstitutional NEH grant terminations; (ii) commonality – with common questions including \nwhether the grant terminations were carried out in a manner that violated the First Amendment; \n(iii) typicality – with named plaintiffs having had their grants terminated in nearly identical \nmanners to the other class-members; and (iv) adequacy – with no known conflicts preventing the \n76 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 77 of 82\n \nnamed plaintiffs or their counsel from representing the broader class-members. (See Dkt. No. 107, \nat 7-9). Plaintiffs further explained that their class-members would satisfy Rule 23(b)(2) because \nDefendants acted against all members in the same manner through the terminations and enjoining \nthat agency action would appropriately grant relief. \n  In responding to these arguments, (See Dkt. No. 114), Defendants countered that the \npurported class-members failed to meet Rule 23’s commonality and typicality requirements, and \nthat certification would not be proper under Rule 23(b)(2). As applied to the Grant Termination \nClaims, this boils down to an argument that Plaintiffs do not allege that all class members suffered \nthe same First Amendment injury and therefore lack commonality/typicality. \nThe Government’s position is singularly unpersuasive. \n  Defendants claim that “an analysis of whether a member of a putative class would suffer \nirreparable harm, absent such relief . . . requires . . . individualized considerations” that are not \nsuited to class-wide adjudication. Not so here. The Court has concluded that Plaintiffs are entitled \nto  preliminary  injunctive  relief  solely  because  they  are  likely  to  succeed  on  the  merits  of \ndemonstrating that the Mass Termination pursuant to which their grants were terminated was \ncarried out in violation of the First Amendment. This, in turn, constitutes a violation of the APA \nthat must be held unlawful and set aside as contrary to constitutional right. See 5 U.S.C. § \n706(2)(B).  \nPlaintiffs allege, and the evidence supports a preliminary finding, that the grants terminated \nas part of the Mass Termination were selected for termination for one of two reasons – either \nbecause the matter under study touched on a subject that the current Administration disfavors \n(environmental justice, DEI, or gender ideology), or because the grant was awarded by the \nprevious Administration (the current Administration’s political opponents). Either ground violates \n77 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 78 of 82\n \nthe First Amendment. There is no need for any individualized assessment of whether each class \nmember suffered the same First Amendment injury; the evidence presently before the court \n(including evidence produced by the Government) demonstrates that all putative class members \nhad their grants terminated in the same way, at the same time, and for the same unconstitutional \nreasons (they promoted a disfavored viewpoint or were awarded by the Biden administration). It \nmight be the case that individual members of the class could have had their grants terminated for \nsome perfectly constitutional reason, but at the moment there is no evidence in the record that their \ngrants were actually terminated for such reason. There is, therefore, no basis on which the \nGovernment can assert that the nature of various class members’ First Amendment injury is likely \nto differ.  \nSimilarly, there is no need to explore irreparable harm on any individualized basis. As \nexplained above, “Where a plaintiff alleges injury from a rule or regulation that directly limits \nspeech, the irreparable nature of the harm may be presumed.” Bronx Household of Faith v. Bd. of \nEduc. of City of N.Y., 331 F.3d 342, 349 (2d Cir. 2003). The nature of Plaintiffs’ common \nconstitutional injury preempts the need to individually evaluate the irreparable nature of any other \nconsequential harms that Plaintiffs have suffered or likely will suffer – though I am assured by the \nmany moving declaration that I have received that such harms are very real and very damaging to \npeople who have had their grants summarily terminated for unconstitutional reasons. \nDefendants insist that Plaintiffs do not claim “that every grant implicated by the Mass \nTermination was terminated because it related to ‘K-12 education,’ ‘gender ideology,’ or ‘DEI,’ or \nthat every grant was terminated because of its association with the Biden administration.” (Dkt. \nNo. 114, at 5). But that is manifestly not the case. In Authors Guild’s Memorandum in support of \nits Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, it argues that the absence of any individualized analysis, \n78 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 79 of 82\n \nthe termination of almost every grant issued during the Biden Administration, and the repeated \nreferences to disfavored viewpoints that the current administration associates with its predecessor, \n(see Dkt. No. 65-1, at 20), taken together, strongly suggests that that Defendants took as their \nlodestar the position that any grant (1) that appeared to have anything to do with diversity, equity, \ninclusion, gender or environmentalism, or (2) that was awarded during the Biden administration \nshould be defunded. The record evidence outlined above certainly supports that position. For the \nGovernment to say that Plaintiffs do not assert this is absurd.   \nThe only evidence offered by Defendants to counter the showing made by Plaintiffs is \nActing Chairman McDonald’s averral that he selected some grants that might otherwise have been \nterminated to keep in place “as important for the nation’s semiquincentennial celebrations.” (Dkt. \nNo. 30, at 2). But that does not affect Plaintiffs’ argument that the grants that were terminated were \nchosen because of their content or their association with the prior administration. As illustrated \nabove, McDonald most certainly did not spare from termination every grant relating to American \nhistory in his effort to continue funding for the nation’s 250th birthday party – the Administration’s \nostensibly preferred subject of study. Grants supporting historical research that does not accord \nwith the Administration’s sanitized view of our history were axed for that very reason.  \nAt this stage, this argument appears sufficient, on its own, to provide a common legal \nquestion to all purported class-members, on which the named plaintiffs’ claims are typical, and in \nconnection with which Defendants acted against all members in the same manner. \nOf course, discovery may well lead to the conclusion that some persons who received \nTermination Notices as part of the Mass Termination ought not be part of a fully certified class – \neven though, for purposes of the Mass Termination, they all appear to have been treated identically, \nright down to the termination notice they received. But that is for another day. As the Supreme \n79 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 80 of 82\n \nCourt explained in A.A.R.P., “Preliminary relief is customarily granted on the basis of procedures \nthat are less formal and evidence that is less complete than in a trial on the merits. The purpose of \nsuch relief is merely to preserve the relative positions of the parties pending further proceedings.” \nA. A. R. P., 145 S. Ct. 1364, 1368 (emphasis added). There will be further proceedings, including \nfull briefing on a motion for class certification, as well as full discovery into the process that was \nused to select grants for termination – a process that, aside from the few damning facts discussed \nabove, remains opaque.  \n  Which brings us to our final question – how to structure this preliminary class-wide relief. \nThe Authors Guild Plaintiffs have asked that the Defendants be enjoined from giving effect \nto the grant terminations of April 1-3, 2025; that they be enjoined from future constitutional or \nstatutory violations; that the monies awarded in those grants not be re-obligated; and that the NEH \npay out monies on the ascribed time frames.  \nStarting at the end, any order directing the NEH to pay out monies previously awarded in \naccordance with their schedules necessarily rests on the terms and conditions of the grant contracts; \nthat is relief that can only be awarded by the Court of Federal Claims. I cannot and will not enter \nany such injunction.  \n  I can, however, direct that the grant terminations be temporarily set aside – be placed on \nhold, as it were – until we can hold a trial on the merits. This is not any sort of “universal \ninjunction;” it applies only to the members of the two plaintiff classes pleaded in Authors Guild \n(approximately 1400 persons) and does not in any way restrict the NEH from taking action with \nrespect to anyone else.  \nSimilarly, while I cannot order that the withdrawn grant funding be paid out, I can certainly \ndirect that those funds not be re-obligated pendente lite – essentially, I can enter an order that these \n80 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 81 of 82\n \nfunds be “escrowed” until we can hold a trial. Enjoining the re-obligation of funds means that \nmoney will be available should (for example) the Government conclude that the better part of valor \nis to conduct a constitutionally compliant “do over” – a process that could lead to the reinstatement \nof some or all of the grants. We have not yet had nearly adequate briefing on final remedies; I \nmerely make this observation to note, as I stated earlier, that the payment of money does not appear \nto be the only or even the most likely way to redress the injury suffered here. However, I again \nnote that the fact that the Government may at the end of the day be required to pay out money does \nnot automatically implicate the Tucker Act. Bowen v. Massachusetts, 487 U.S. 879, 910 (1988).21 \n  The injunction is narrowly tailored to maintain the status quo until we can decide whether \nPlaintiffs are entitled to ultimate relief. It does nothing more. It will be entered only in the Authors \nGuild case and not in the ACLS case, because the ACLS Plaintiffs did not move for preliminary \ninjunctive relief on First Amendment grounds – although they asserted First Amendment claims \n(Counts VII and VIII) which remain in the case to be adjudicated.  \nThe Authors Guild Plaintiffs should provide the Court with a proposed order implementing \nthis decision. \nCONCLUSION \nAuthors Guild’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED to the extent described \nabove, ACLS’s Motion for a Preliminary Injunction is DENIED, and the Government’s Motion to \nDismiss is GRANTED to the extent of dismissing ACLS Counts I, II, III, IV, V, and VI, and \n \n21 Note that, just as we were going to press, we learned that the judge in Porwancher reached the same conclusion in \nthat case. \n81 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 116     Filed 07/25/25     Page 82 of 82",

It achieves these ends principally by awarding grants to \nsupport scholars’ research and publication of culturally significant works. This suit involves about \n1,500 such grants, which NEH issued after its highly competitive, months-long, expert-led review \nprocess determined that the funded projects were intellectually significant, of high quality, and \nworthy of the honor and prestige of an NEH grant.  \nThen, over the course of a few days in April, two operatives from the U.S. DOGE Service \n(“DOGE”) swept into NEH and terminated the grants en masse via late-night emails sent from a \nnon-government  email  address  (the  “Mass  Termination”).  There  was  no  expert  review,  no \nindividualized assessment, and no meaningful explanation. Instead, the Mass Termination rested \non  the  conclusory  assertion  that  the  grants  “no  longer  effectuate  the  agency’s  needs  and \npriorities”—a rationale applied identically to every terminated project regardless of its subject \nmatter or merit. \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims challenging these unlawful actions. The \nMass Termination bears exactly none of the hallmarks of the reasoned agency action required by \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The letters attached to the termination emails provide \nno real explanation for the Mass Termination, much less one that would account for the grievous \nharms it inflicts on grantees. Instead, the letters consist of identical, boilerplate, conclusory \nstatements that cite no evidence, misidentify governing law, and ignore the substantial reliance \ninterests at stake. Equally troubling, the Mass Termination appears to target grants based on their \nperceived  viewpoints  and  association  with  the  prior  administration—a  form  of  viewpoint \ndiscrimination prohibited by the First Amendment. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 9 of 35\n \nThe harm to Plaintiffs is both immediate and irreparable. Scholars have structured their \nprofessional lives around these grants, obtaining leaves of absence, performing substantial work \non their projects, and forgoing other opportunities in reliance on NEH’s commitment. With grant \naffiliation and funding terminated midstream or on the eve of disbursement, they are left without \ntime to replan and without viable alternatives to advance their projects and their careers. The Mass \nTermination cuts them off from rare, time-sensitive opportunities that form the basis of career \nadvancement and scholarly contribution, threatening to derail their long-term reputations and the \nvery viability of their work in the public humanities. \nFinally, the balance of harms decisively favors Plaintiffs. Defendants have no legitimate \ninterest in maintaining unlawful agency action, while the public interest lies in preserving the \nexpert-driven process that Congress established to advance the humanities and in benefitting from \nthe works that NEH grants enable. Preliminary relief is both warranted and necessary. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  The National Endowment for the Humanities \nThe  NEH  is  an  independent  federal  agency  that  aims  to  promote  excellence  in  the \nhumanities, convey the lessons of history, and strengthen the nation. When creating the NEH, \nCongress expressly declared that “the humanities belong to all the people of the United States,” \nand recognized that “[a]n advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology \nalone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural \nactivity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and \na better view of the future.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1), (3).  \nTo advance this mission, Congress authorized the NEH to provide funding for individuals \nand organizations involved in research, publication of scholarly works, and promotion of the \nhumanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956. Specifically, Congress provided that the NEH may “enter into \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 10 of 35\n \narrangements,” including “contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of assistance,” to serve ten \nenumerated purposes, including “promot[ing] progress and scholarship in the humanities,” id. \n§ 956(c)(1), “foster[ing] the interchange of information in the humanities,” id. § 956(c)(6), and \n“support[ing] the publication of scholarly works in the humanities,” id. § 956(c)(8). \nOver its history, the NEH has awarded over $6 billion to support museums, historic sites, \nuniversities, teachers, libraries, documentary filmmakers, public TV and radio stations, research \ninstitutions, scholars, and local humanities programming nationwide, cementing the United States’ \nrole as a global leader in the humanities. See Lieberman Decl., Ex. A at 4. NEH grants have \nsupported the building blocks of American civil society, helping to examine the human condition, \npromote civics education, understand our cultural heritage, foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs \nand cultures, develop media and information literacy, create documentaries and podcasts, facilitate \ngroundbreaking research, and preserve and expand access to cultural and historical artifacts. Id. \nB.  The NEH’s Grant Programs \nPrior to the actions at issue in this case, the NEH offered 47 grant programs to support the \nhumanities nationwide. See Lieberman Decl., Ex. B. These programs were highly competitive and \nprestigious. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members were among the recipients of these prestigious \ngrants, including through the Public Scholars Program; the Fellowships Program; the Summer \nStipends Program; the Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) Program; the \nAwards for Faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Program; and the \nFellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions (FPIRI): \n•  Plaintiff Authors Guild is a national non-profit membership association of more \nthan 16,000 professional, published writers of all genres. Authors Guild has many \nmembers who received grants from the NEH, including grantees under the Public \nScholars, Fellowship, and Summer Stipend programs.

Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Bill Goldstein, an independent scholar, received a Public Scholars Award \nfor his biography of Larry Kramer, an AIDS activist whose work pushed the \ngovernment to confront its neglect of the AIDS crisis and helped reframe how \nmarginalized communities organize for survival. Goldstein Decl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Benjamin Holtzman, an Assistant Professor at Lehman College, received \nan Award for Faculty at HSIs for his book project on the activist networks that took \nroot to combat the national resurgence of white supremacist organizing in the late \n1970s and 1980s. Holtzman Decl. ¶ 3. \n•  Plaintiff Katalin Balog, a professor at Rutgers University-Newark, received a \nFellowship Award for her book exploring changes in the concept of mind during \nthe last 300 years and critiques current views on philosophical and moral grounds. \nBalog Decl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Valerie Orlando, a professor at the University of Maryland, was awarded \na Summer Stipend Award for research on a book project about history and memory \nin contemporary Algerian literature. Orlando Decl. ¶ 3. \n•  Plaintiff Nicole Jenkins, an Assistant Professor at Howard University, received an \nAward for Faculty at HBCUs to complete her book examining Black women’s \nnavigation of beauty norms, family, and Black women’s identity-making. Jenkins \nDecl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Lee Jasperse, a Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago, received a \nfellowship at the Massachusetts Historical Society that was supported fully by an \nFPIRI grant. Jasperse Decl. ¶ 2. \nEach of these grants was awarded after a highly competitive, expert-led review process \ndetermined that the projects were intellectually significant, of high quality, and worthy of the honor \nand prestige of an NEH grant. Each year, NEH conducted more than 200 review panels, involving \nnearly 1,000 outside experts, in its evaluation of approximately 5,700 applications across all grant \nprograms. Lieberman Decl., Ex. C. \nC.  The Mass Termination \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump established DOGE as a new component of the \nExecutive Office of the President. E.O. 14,158 § 3(a) (Jan. 20, 2025). The Executive Order \nrequired agencies to work with a “DOGE Team Lead” who would “advise” the agency “on \nimplementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” Id. § 3(c). In a subsequent Executive Order, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 12 of 35\n \nPresident directed agencies to work with DOGE to “terminate or modify ... contracts and grants to \nreduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to promote efficiency and advance the \npolicies of my Administration.” E.O. 14,222 § 3(b) (Feb. 26, 2025). \nIn March 2025, two DOGE operatives—Defendants Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox—\narrived at NEH. John Doe Decl., ECF 31 ¶ 2; Jane Doe Decl., ECF 32 ¶ 8. Cavanaugh and Fox \nmet with senior NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. Jane Doe Decl. ¶ 12. \nOn April 1, 2025, Defendant McDonald, NEH’s Acting Chairman, told NEH staff that DOGE \nsought to “claw back” $170 million in grants. Id. At the end of March or the beginning of April, \nCavanaugh and/or Fox began reviewing a list of open NEH grants and personally choosing which \ngrants would be terminated. John Doe Decl. ¶ 3; Richard Roe Decl., ECF 30 ¶ 2.  \nAcross the first few days of April, Fox emailed nearly 1,500 grantees and informed them \nthat their grants were being terminated (hereinafter, the “Mass Termination”). See Richard Roe \nDecl. ¶ 2; John Doe Decl. ¶ 3; Mark Moe Decl., ECF 50 ¶ 1. This included nearly all grants \nawarded during the Biden administration. Richard Roe Decl. ¶ 2. The termination notification to \ngrantees  did  not  come  from  an  NEH  email  address,  but  rather  from \nGrant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com. Id.; Goldstein Decl., Ex. B. The emails attached \na grant termination letter purportedly signed by McDonald. See Kadetsky Decl., Ex. B; Goldstein \nDecl., Ex. C; Holtzman Decl., Ex. D; Orlando Decl., Ex. B. \nThe termination letters received by Plaintiffs and their members as part of the Mass \nTermination were nearly identical, with boilerplate language and no specific information about \nany grantee or the reasons their specific grants were being terminated. The letters uniformly stated: \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions \nof the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable \ncauses, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, NEH has reasonable cause to \nterminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 13 of 35\n \nallocations  in  a  new  direction  in  furtherance  of  the  President’s  agenda.  The \nPresident’s February 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate all \nnon-statutorily required activities and functions. See Commencing the Reduction \nof the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate \ntermination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities…. The termination of your grant represents an urgent \npriority for the administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to \nthe traditional notification process is not possible.  \nId. Grantees who tried to appeal the termination were ignored or told that “dispute resolution was \nnot available.” Goldstein Decl. ¶ 6; Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 9; Orlando Decl. ¶ 7; Balog Decl., Ex. D. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is warranted if Plaintiffs establish (1) a likelihood of success on \nthe merits; (2) that irreparable harm is likely without preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of \nequities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor; and (4) that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). When the government is the opposing \nparty, the final two factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction To Grant The Requested Relief. \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction and authority to grant the relief requested. As \nmany agencies have done in similar cases, however, Defendants are likely to argue that this suit \nmust be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). \nThis Court should reject that argument, just as courts around the country have done repeatedly in \nrecent weeks.

Apr. 11, 2025); Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 893530, at *3-*6 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. \nEduc. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 863319, at *2-*5 (D. Md. Mar. 19, 2025) (all rejecting same \njurisdictional argument). \nA.  This Court Has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ APA Claims. \nThe APA generally waives the federal government’s immunity from lawsuits challenging \nagency action and “seeking relief other than money damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. That waiver covers \nthis lawsuit, which challenges agency action and seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief. See \nAm. Compl., ECF 65 at 58. Under long-established Supreme Court precedent, the fact that \ncomplying with an injunction may result in the Government’s disbursement of grant funds does \nnot transform the action into one for “money damages” under the APA. Bowen v. Massachusetts, \n487 U. S. 879, 910 (1988). As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, “a district court’s jurisdiction \nis not barred by the possibility that an order setting aside an agency’s action may result in the \ndisbursement of funds.” Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per curiam) (quoting \nBowen, 487 U.S. at 910); see also, e.g., Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *6-*9. \nThe Tucker Act divests district courts of APA jurisdiction only when the plaintiff’s APA \nclaim is really a contract action in disguise—i.e., if it both involves an actual “contract” and is “‘at \nits essence’ a contract action.” Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982). That \nimplied exception is narrow; courts routinely reject the “‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring \nsome reference to or incorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly \nwithin the Tucker Act.’” Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022); \nsee Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, 407-08 (2d Cir. 2015) (applying same test). \nThe Government’s Tucker Act argument therefore “hinges on characterizing Plaintiffs’ claims as \ndisguised contract claims rather than legitimate APA challenges.” Pacito, 2025 WL 893530, at *4.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 15 of 35\n \nThat characterization is wrong, for two independent reasons. First, federal law carefully \ndistinguishes between “grants” and “contracts”; this case involves the former and the Tucker Act \napplies only to the latter. Second, even if NEH grants were “contracts,” there still would be no \nTucker Act jurisdiction because this lawsuit “is not ‘at its essence’ a contract action.” Megapulse, \n672 F.2d at 968. \nThis Case Does Not Involve Contracts. Before even applying the Megapulse test, the court \nmust first find that the instrument at issue is, in fact, a contract. For it to be a contract, it “must \ncontain the four required elements of offer, acceptance, consideration, and proper government \nauthority.” Am. Near E. Refugee Aid v. USAID, 703 F.Supp.3d 126, 131 (D.D.C. 2023). In this \ncontext, the “consideration” requirement is satisfied only if the instrument provides a “tangible” \nand “direct” benefit to the federal government, rather than a “generalized” or “incidental” one. Id. \nMerely advancing U.S. “policy interests” or providing a “generalized benefit” for the public is not \nenough; the benefit must be direct, such as a “financial benefit.” Id. at 133. For example, in St. \nBernard Par. Gov’t v. United States, 134 Fed. Cl. 730 (2017), the Court of Federal Claims lacked \nTucker Act jurisdiction because plaintiff’s removal of debris from public spaces did not provide a \n“direct” benefit to the government, only a “generalized benefit” to the public. Id. at 736; see also \nRefugee Aid, 703 F.Supp.3d at 132-33 (same with respect to government-funded construction of \ninfrastructure in the West Bank).1  \nLikewise  here,  NEH  grants  do  not  confer  “tangible”  and  “direct”  benefits  to  the \ngovernment,  only  “generalized”  ones  to  the  public.  NEH  grants  to  scholars,  writers,  and \n \n1 In distinguishing between contracts and other instruments, courts also look to the Federal \nGrant and Cooperative Agreements Act, 31 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq. Consistent with the cases, the \nFGCAA defines a “contract” as an instrument with the “principal purpose of … acquir[ing] … \nproperty or services for the direct benefit or use of the [] Government,” 31 U.S.C. § 6303(1), while \nit defines a “grant” as an instrument with the principal purpose of “carry[ing] out a public purpose \nof support or stimulation,” id. § 6304(1). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 16 of 35\n \ninstitutions advance the humanities and public understanding as articulated in 20 U.S.C. § 951, \nsupporting books, research, and cultural works that benefit the general public, not the government \nspecifically. That makes NEH awards “grants” rather than “contracts.” Indeed, NEH itself has \nrecognized as much: while it has statutory authority to use both “contracts” and “grants,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(c), it consistently calls the awards at issue here “grants.” See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 59, 68, 75, 83, \n92 (quoting NEH website). Accordingly, the Tucker Act does not apply and does not displace this \nCourt’s jurisdiction. \nThis Is Not “At Its Essence” A Contract Claim. Even where an actual “contract” is \ninvolved, the Tucker Act precludes jurisdiction only when the plaintiff’s claim “is at its essence a \ncontract claim.” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. The mere fact “that a court may have to rule on a \ncontract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform” an \nAPA action into a contract action. Id. Instead, to determine whether a case is “at its essence” a \ncontract action, courts consider “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, \nand … the type of relief sought (or appropriate).” Id.; see Atterbury, 805 F.3d at 406 (applying this \ntest). Here, both factors favor this Court’s jurisdiction. \nFirst, Plaintiffs root their claims in federal statutes, not contract terms. They claim that \nDefendants’ actions violate the APA, the Impoundment Control Act, the NEH’s organic statute, \nand the First Amendment, not the terms of any contract. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 144-89. The “source of \nthe rights” here, Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968, is thus not contractual. Plaintiffs are challenging \nagency overreach and failure to comply with required administrative procedures—the heartland of \nthe APA. Bowen, 487 U.S. at 904-05. Second, “the type of relief sought” differs from the relief \navailable from a Tucker Act claim. Plaintiffs are not asking the Court for money damages or \nspecific performance of grant terms, but simply to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)—i.e., to set aside the Mass Termination and restore the ex ante status quo. See \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 17 of 35\n \nAm. Compl. at 58. This “is not a suit seeking money in compensation for the damage sustained by \nthe failure of the Federal Government to pay as mandated; rather, it is a suit seeking to enforce the \nstatutory mandate itself.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 900. The fact that an injunction may lead to the \ngovernment making grant payments does not strip this Court of jurisdiction. Crowley, 38 F.4th at \n1108. \nThe Government will likely argue—as it has in other cases—that the Supreme Court’s \nemergency-docket order granting a stay in Dep’t of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, \nchanges all of this. It does not. As courts have explained in rejecting that argument, California \n“announces no new rule of law”; it merely reaffirmed the long-standing rule that the APA’s waiver \nof sovereign immunity “does not extend to orders to enforce a contractual obligation to pay \nmoney.” Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 1077401, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 9, 2025); accord Cmty. \nLegal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. HHS, 2025 WL 1168898, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2025) (“[T]he \nGovernment fails to identify anything different about the law following the Supreme Court’s \norder.”); Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 1116157, at *14 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (“The Government overreads the three-page stay order.”). As already \nexplained, Plaintiffs do not seek to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money. \nEven if California made new law, it would not apply to these facts. In California, Plaintiffs’ \nclaims put “the terms and conditions of each individual grant award [] at issue,” California v. DOE, \n132 F.4th 92, 96–97 (1st Cir. 2025), and the district court’s order “require[d] the Government to \npay out past-due grant obligations.” 145 S. Ct. at 968. Because the plaintiffs were suing based on \nthe grant terms and seeking payment of past-due sums, they were plainly seeking “to enforce a \ncontractual obligation to pay money.” California, 145 S. Ct. at 968.2 Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs’ \n \n2 The plaintiffs in DOE did not argue that their awards were not “contracts.” \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 18 of 35\n \nclaims relate to Defendants’ blanket termination of grants, not the terms and conditions of each \nindividual grant, and they seek an order setting aside agency action—the quintessential APA \nremedy—not one mandating payment of past-due sums. See Rhode Island, 2025 WL 1303868, at \n*7 (“Because the [] challenges are based on alleged statutory and constitutional violations and the \nrelief they seek is equitable, the essence of their claims are not contractual.”). \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims seek to redress harms that money damages cannot redress. A final \nreason Plaintiffs’ APA claims are properly before this Court is that, given the nonmonetary nature \nof the harms, “the doubtful and limited relief available in the Claims Court is not an adequate \nsubstitute for review in the District Court.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 901. As discussed in more detail \nin Part III, infra, absent an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer far more than lost dollars; they will \nlose career opportunities, the prestige and publishing opportunities associated with an NEH grant, \nand in some cases the ability to complete projects they have worked on for years. The Court of \nFederal Claims cannot issue relief for nonmonetary harms, see Nat’l Air Traffic Controllers Ass’n \nv. United States, 160 F.3d 714, 716 (Fed. Cir. 1988), making it impossible for Plaintiffs to get \n“complete relief” there, Bowen, 487 at 910. Accordingly, courts regularly hold that APA actions \nmay proceed in district court when money damages would not make plaintiffs whole. See, e.g., \nAm. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. O.P.M., 2025 WL 996542, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2025). The Court \nshould hold the same here. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Non-APA Claims Are Also Properly Before the Court. \nSeparate from their APA claims, Plaintiffs bring implied-right-of-action claims to enjoin \nthe individual Defendants’ ultra vires actions. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 163-89. These claims do not \nrely on the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity; they proceed under the Larson-Dugan doctrine, \npursuant to which officials have no sovereign immunity from suits to enjoin them from exceeding \nconstitutional or statutory mandates. See Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 19 of 35\n \n682, 689 (1949); Pieczenik v. Cambridge Antibody Tech. Grp., 2004 WL 1118500, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nMay 14, 2004) (noting that “no separate waiver of sovereign immunity is needed” when a \ngovernment official acts ultra vires). Like Plaintiffs’ APA claims, these claims seek only non-\nmonetary relief and could not be heard under the Tucker Act, making this the proper forum.  \nII.  Plaintiffs Have A Strong Likelihood Of Success. \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits because the Mass Termination violates the \nAPA, violates the First Amendment, and was undertaken without authority. See 725 Eatery Corp. \nv. City of N.Y., 408 F. Supp. 3d 424, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (plaintiffs “need only show a likelihood \nof success on the merits of at least one of [their] claims.”). \nA.  The Mass Termination Violated the APA. \nThe Mass Termination several times over runs afoul of the APA’s prohibition on arbitrary \nand capricious agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The APA requires an agency to provide a \nreasoned basis for its actions and to “cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given \nmanner.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n48 (1983). An agency must “examine[] the relevant data and articulate[] a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id. at \n43. If the agency fails “to provide even that minimal level of analysis, its action is arbitrary and \ncapricious and so cannot carry the force of law.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. \n211, 221 (2016); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (agency action is “arbitrary and capricious if \nthe agency ... entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem” or “offered an \nexplanation ... so implausible that it could not be ... the product of agency expertise.”). Moreover, \nif an agency reverses a prior position, it must “display awareness that it is changing position,” \n“show that there are good reasons for the new policy” and, where the prior policy has engendered \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 20 of 35\n \nserious reliance interests, provide a “detailed justification” for its change of course. FCC v. Fox \nTV Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).   \nHere,  NEH’s  justification  for  the  Mass  Termination  consists,  in  its  entirety,  of  the \nfollowing: \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions \nof the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable \ncauses, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, NEH has reasonable cause to \nterminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding \nallocations  in  a  new  direction  in  furtherance  of  the  President’s  agenda.  The \nPresident’s February 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate all \nnon-statutorily required activities and functions. See Commencing the Reduction \nof the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate \ntermination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities. \n \nKadetsky Decl., Ex. B; Goldstein Decl., Ex. C; Holtzman Decl., Ex. D; Orlando Decl., Ex. B.3 \nThis conclusory, boilerplate justification fails the APA’s bedrock requirements. \nThat the Mass Termination was arbitrary and capricious is most evident in the fact that \nDefendants canceled nearly 1,500 grants en masse with form letters. Those form letters not include \neven a basic level of analysis as to any one grant; nearly 1,500 grantees were told in boilerplate \nfashion  that their grant  “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities.” Id. Such \n“boilerplate” explanations, “devoid of ... any independent explanation, are grossly insufficient and \nfall far short of reasoned analysis.” Rhode Island, 2025 WL 1303868, at *11; see also Am. Ass’n \nof Colls., 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (“[T]he Department’s use of a template or boilerplate letter \nissued to all Grant Recipients further strengthens Plaintiffs’ argument.”). \n \n3 “[J]udicial review of agency action is limited to the grounds that the agency invoked when \nit took the action.” DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 20 (2020).  Here, the \ntermination letters provide the only contemporaneous explanation for the Mass Termination. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 21 of 35\n \nThe conclusory statements in the form letters do not provide the required “reasoned \nexplanation” for the Mass Termination. See Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1352 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (“programmatic boilerplate” is not a “reasoned explanation”); NRDC v. Dep’t of \nEnergy, 362 F. Supp. 3d 126, 144 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (A “conclusory statement ... falls well short of \nthe APA’s requirement that an agency provided reasoned explanation.”). They begin by asserting \nthat the grants “no longer effectuate[] the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement,” but they do not explain what those “needs and priorities” are, what “conditions” are \nbeing referenced, or “how or why the [agency] concluded” that each individual grantee’s project \nwould not effectuate those criteria. Ass’n of Am. Univs., 2025 WL 1414135, at *12. These \n“conclusory statements do not ‘reasonably’ explain agency action.” Rhode Island, 2025 WL \n1303868, at *10; see also, e.g., Am. Assoc. of Colleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *20-21 (agency’s \nconclusory statement that grants were “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuat[ed], Department \npriorities” was not “reasonable explanation” for mass termination of grants). \nThe termination letters next assert that the grants are “subject to termination due to several \nreasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340 [sic],” but they do not specify any of the four \ndisjunctive grounds for termination in that regulation or explain the basis on which it concluded \nthat any such ground applied with respect to any particular grant. An agency cannot point to \npossible reasons for action; it must provide a reasoned explanation of why it acted: “It will not do \nfor a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency’s action.” SEC v. Chenery \nCorp., 332 U.S. 194, 196–97 (1947); see also Am. Ass’n of Colleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 \n(arbitrary and capricious for termination letters to “merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways in \nwhich the specific grants at issue might be ‘inconsistent’”). That lack of clarity is compounded by \nthe termination letters’ statement that “NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new \ndirection in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” as the regulation does not list a President’s \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 22 of 35\n \nchanging preferences as one of the enumerated bases for termination. 2 C.F.R. § 200.340. And \neven if it did, Defendants again provide no explanation of how or why—or whether—they \nconcluded that any given grant was not “in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”   \nThe termination letters next state that a February 19, 2025, Executive Order “mandates that \nthe NEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and functions,” but the cited Executive \nOrder does not even mention the NEH, let alone “mandate” any action with respect to NEH grants. \nThis “disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given” is the very definition of \n“arbitrary.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). And even if the E.O. mentioned \nthe NEH, the letters still do “not show[] that any analysis was conducted to determine which \n‘[activities] and functions’ of [NEH] are statutorily required, and which are not.” Rhode Island, \n2025 WL 1303868, at *10.  \nThe letters claim that termination is “necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal \ngovernment, including its fiscal priorities,” but, again, provide no explanation for why that is the \ncase or why it provides a basis for termination. Indeed, it is nonsensical to claim “fiscal priorities” \nare safeguarded by abandoning projects after significant taxpayer investment but before they are \ncompleted and made available to enrich the public. Stating an “aspirational goal[]” of saving \nmoney is “not the same as reasoned explanations for why an action is chosen or how the chosen \naction will effectuate the stated goals.” Ass’n of Am. Univs., 2025 WL 1414135, at *12. \nDefendants also failed to provide sufficient reasons for their change in policy and consider \ngrantees’  “serious  reliance  interests.”  Regents  of  the  Univ.  of  California,  591  U.S.  at  30. \nDefendants provided no “reasoned explanation” for why NEH “change[d] course,” id., reversing \nnearly 1,500 decisions it had previously made through a rigorous, expert-guided review process. \nNor could it. Defendant McDonald admitted in an NEH staff meeting that the Mass Termination \nwas completely untethered from any consideration of each grant’s merits. Instead, the agency’s \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 23 of 35\n \n“rationale” for the change in course “was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at \nother agencies and they applied the same methodology here.”4  \nDefendants also did not consider, or even acknowledge, the reliance interests of grantees, \nwhich are significant. See Fox, 556 U.S. at 515-16 (explaining that it is arbitrary and capricious to \nignore reliance interests). For example, many grantees already spent significant time and resources \non funded projects put in jeopardy by Defendants’ change of course. See, e.g., Holtzman Decl. \n¶¶ 7, 9; Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7. Likewise, many abandoned other funding and employment \nopportunities to work on the grant-funded projects. See, e.g., Goldstein Decl. ¶ 4; Jenkins Decl. ¶¶ \n7-9; Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 7; Jasperse Decl. ¶ 4; see also infra Part III (detailing other actions taken in \nreliance on grants). Defendants did not acknowledge any of these reliance interests, much less \nprovide a reasoned basis for acting despite them. Defendants’ failure to “assess the reliance \ninterests” violates the APA. Pacito, 2025 WL 893530, at *11; see Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, \nat *17. \n Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because their stated justification “is \nso implausible that it could not be . . . the product of agency expertise.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43. It is utterly implausible that almost 1,500 projects suddenly and all at once stopped furthering \n“agency priorities”—i.e., advancing the humanities—despite having been selected from among \nthousands of applications as the most meritorious humanities projects. Indeed, far from relying on \nagency expertise, Defendants expressly eschewed the NEH’s standard, expert-guided process for \nevaluating  grant  applications.  Richard  Roe  Decl.  ¶¶  1-2;  John  Doe  Decl.  ¶  3.  The  Mass \nTermination was instead directed by Defendants Cavanaugh and Fox, two DOGE staffers who \n \n4 Recording, 4/3/2025 NEH Meeting, \nhttps://www.rev.com/app/transcript/NjgxMTE2MjgzOGFiYWRjZGM5NTIxYjk5ZEpYN0hBcV\nNYY0xJ/o/VEMwNDc3NTI1NjEz/transcript (last accessed May 23, 2025). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 24 of 35\n \nappeared at the agency only days before implementing it, John Doe Decl. ¶ 3, and who do not \npurport to be experts in evaluating humanities projects. Nothing in the record suggests they (or \nanyone with humanities expertise) evaluated the scholarly or artistic merit of any of the projects \nbefore the Mass Termination. \nDefendants’ actions were arbitrary and capricious in other respects as well. Defendants \n“entirely failed to consider … important aspect[s] of the problem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, \nincluding the significant consequences the termination will have on the grantees, the state(s), and \ncongressional district(s) in which the works are being produced, and the broader public that would \nbenefit from completion and release of the funded works. Defendants also “offered an explanation \nfor [the] decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nAs NEH itself previously determined, the evidence showed that each grantee’s project was worthy \nof an NEH grant. No new evidence came before the agency; it simply ignored the evidence on \nwhich it had previously relied and terminated the grants en masse. Finally, Defendants failed to \nconsider whether the Mass Termination would advance NEH’s statutory purposes, 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 951, 956. Agencies are “bound ... by the ultimate purposes Congress has selected,” New York \nv. DHS, 969 F.3d 42, 82 (2d Cir. 2020), but Defendants failed entirely to consider how its Mass \nTermination could possibly advance Congress’s purposes to, e.g., “develop and encourage the \npursuit of a national policy for the promotion of progress and scholarship in the humanities,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 956(c)(1). \nFor all these reasons, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the grounds that Defendants acted \nunreasonably, arbitrarily, and capriciously in terminating Plaintiffs’ grants. \nB.  The Mass Termination Violated the First Amendment. \nThe First Amendment rests on “[t]he bedrock principle of viewpoint neutrality,” which \n“demands that the state not suppress speech” due to “disagreement with the underlying ideology \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 25 of 35\n \nor perspective that the speech expresses.” Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 390 F.3d 65, 82 (1st \nCir. 2004). Even “in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not ‘aim at the suppression’” \nof ideas it disfavors. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998). The NEH’s \ncharge is to make value-based judgments about which projects will advance “progress and \nscholarship in the humanities,” 20 U.S.C. § 956(c)(1), not to “leverage[s] its power to award \nsubsidies … into a penalty on disfavored viewpoints.” Finley, 524 U.S. at 587. \nFinley in particular is instructive. There, the Supreme Court upheld a provision requiring \nthe National Endowment for the Arts to consider “general standards of decency and respect” in \nawarding grants, finding that the requirement was “merely hortatory.” 524 U.S. at 580. But it made \nclear that it “would confront a different case” if an agency were to deny grants to projects because \nthey expressed disfavored viewpoints. Id. at 587. Even in the context of a public grant program, \nthe government may not impose “a disproportionate burden calculated to drive ‘certain ideas or \nviewpoints from the marketplace,’” or “threaten[] to suppress the expression of particular ideas or \nviewpoints.’” Id. \nDecisions regarding other government benefits echo this rule. Congress may not condition \nits funding of the Legal Services Corporation on its attorneys’ agreement not to express viewpoints \nthe government disfavors. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 540-49 (2001). Congress \nlikewise may not impose viewpoint-based restrictions on granting the government benefit of a \ntrademark. Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). Cities may not withdraw funding from a \nmuseum “because of the perceived viewpoint of the works.” Brooklyn Inst. of Arts & Scis. v. City \nof New York, 64 F. Supp. 2d 184, 202 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). And cities likewise may not discontinue \nan organization’s arts funding because of the organization’s viewpoints on social issues. Esperanza \nPeace & Justice Center v. San Antonio, 316 F. Supp. 2d 433, 447-56 (W.D. Tex. 2001). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 26 of 35\n \nIn violation of those principles, Defendants withdrew funding from projects they believed \npromoted or were associated with viewpoints they disfavor. The sequence of events surrounding \nthe Mass Termination and Defendants’ proffered justifications make that unmistakable. During \nthe Biden Administration, NEH awarded grants to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \nafter concluding that the speech and thought reflected in their projects constituted “contributions \nto the humanities” that would advance the agency’s statutory purposes. E.g., Kadetsky Decl., Ex. \nA. Then, after a change in administration, Defendants began terminating those grants en masse, \nnot based on a reassessment of their contributions to the humanities but, it appears, on their \nperceived viewpoints and associations—ultimately terminating almost every grant awarded during \nthe prior administration. See Richard Roe Decl. ¶ 2. \nFirst, in February 2025, before the Mass Termination, NEH staff was informed that grants \nwould be terminated if they expressed any disfavored viewpoints—i.e., if they “violated the new \nExecutive Orders on K-12 education, gender ideology, and DEI.” Id. ¶ 1.5 Those Executive Orders \nrefer to disfavored views on these subjects as “illegal and immoral,” DEI EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8839; “corrosive … on the validity of the entire American system,” Gender EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8615; and “anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false,” Schooling EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8853. \nThe DEI EO and Gender EO highlight the Biden Administration’s association with and support \nfor these disfavored ideas. See DEI EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8839; Gender EO, 90 Fed. Reg., at 8616. \nMany of the termination letters issued to implement the Mass Termination cited those same \nExecutive Orders. See, e.g., Ex. B, Kadetsky Decl.  \n \n5 The referenced Executive Orders are Exec. Order No. 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“DEI EO”); \nExec. Order No. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \nBiological Truth to the Federal Government, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615, (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Gender EO”); \nand Exec. Order No. 14190, Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling, 90 Fed. Reg. 8853 \n(Jan. 29, 2025) (“Schooling EO”).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 27 of 35\n \nMoreover, shortly after the Mass Termination, NEH released a statement that it had \nterminated awards “at variance with agency priorities, including but not limited to those on \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion, and environmental justice,” Lieberman Decl., Ex. D, confirming \nthat the termination was not based on humanistic merit, but to root out disfavored viewpoints. At \nthe same time, NEH began specifically soliciting projects that promote viewpoints favored by \nDefendants, such as projects that “promote” the Nation’s “record of advancing liberty” and the \nidea of “American exceptionalism.”  Lieberman Decl., Ex. E at 1. NEH further noted that while \nprojects on “the suffragist movement or a history of conservation policies in the United States” \nmight be allowed grant funding, those deemed unfavorable by the Administration would not. \nLieberman Decl., Ex. D. The Mass Termination therefore was not a termination of all projects \ntouching on gender or race or the environment, but of projects Defendants perceived as having a \ndisfavored viewpoint on those topics. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination.  \nTo be clear, Plaintiffs’ projects did not promote any particular political, religious, or \nideological points of view—their grant terms prohibited as much. Yet, given the absence of any \nindividualized  analysis,  the  termination  of  almost  every  grant  issued  during  the  Biden \nAdministration,  and  the  repeated  references  to  disfavored  viewpoints  associated  with  that \nadministration, it appears that Defendants broadly (and haphazardly) acted on their belief that any \ngrantee’s association with an opposing political party’s administration meant  they espoused \ndisfavored views. Even if “the [government] makes a factual mistake about” the speaker’s \nmessage, it violates the First Amendment when it rescinds funding based on its perception of the \nspeaker’s message or associations. Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. 266, 272 (2016); see \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 28 of 35\n \nFinley, 524 U.S. at 580.6 Defendants’ “selections among recipients of public subsidies that favor \nand strengthen those friendly to the government’s message while placing at a disadvantage and \nthus weakening the opponents and skeptics” is the kind of hand on the scale that is constitutionally \nverboten. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc. v. USAID, 430 F.Supp.2d 222, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); \nsee also Rhode Island Latino Arts v. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts, 2025 WL 1009026, at *14 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 3, 2025).7 \nDefendants’ termination of grants based on association with a prior administration has a \nparticularly coercive effect, as it discourages grantees from even associating with groups that \nmight have views disfavored by the current administration. Thus, the manner of the termination \nextends its impact beyond these particular grants and into Plaintiffs’ associational choices, even in \nunrelated contexts. That interference with Plaintiffs’ associational rights is likewise prohibited. \nSee Alliance for Open Society, 570 U.S. at 218 (invalidating a requirement that a federal grantee \nbroadly adopt a specific policy position because “the condition by its very nature affects ‘protected \nconduct outside the scope of the federally funded program’”). \nC.  The Mass Termination Was Ultra Vires. \nPlaintiffs join in and incorporate by reference the arguments in Part A.5 (pp. 18-20) of the \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction in the consolidated case, \n \n6 Defendants’ failure to assess each project individually before labeling it as disfavored \nspeech is yet another reason the Mass Termination was arbitrary and capricious. \n7 Some courts have rejected direct, facial First Amendment challenges to the DEI and \nGender EOs, while recognizing that their conclusions may be different in as-applied challenges. \nSee, e.g., Nat’l Urb. League v. Trump, 2025 WL 1275613, at *26 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) (rejecting \nfacial challenge but “reserve[ing] judgment on the merits of any as-applied challenges to specific \nenforcement actions”); see also Latino Arts, 2025 WL 1009026, at *14 (in as-applied challenge, \nfinding “clear First Amendment violation”). In any event, Plaintiffs are not directly challenging \nthe Executive Orders, or even their application.  Instead, the Executive Orders provide evidence \nthat Defendants used the Mass Termination to suppress particular viewpoints. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 29 of 35\n \nNo. 1:25-cv-03657, which argues that the Mass Termination was unconstitutional because DOGE \nhas no legal authority to terminate another agency’s grants. See ECF 52 (noting that Plaintiffs may \n“join the motion for a preliminary injunction” in the consolidated case). \nIII.  The Mass Termination Is Inflicting Irreparable Harm.  \nPlaintiffs—public  scholars,  literary  researchers,  cultural  historians,  and  early-career \nacademics—face irreparable harm to their career trajectories and their immediate livelihoods. \nThey stand to lose not only the support needed to complete individual projects, but the foundational \nopportunities that make a career in the humanities possible. These harms cannot be reversed later \nwith money damages or delayed resolution. They are, in the clearest legal sense, irreparable. \nSeparately, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment injuries constitute immediate, irreparable harm as a matter \nof law. The Mass Termination has thus caused, and will continue to cause, harm that is “actual and \nimminent, not remote or speculative,” and incapable of being remedied by money alone. Freedom \nHoldings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005). \nFirst, Plaintiffs face irreparable harm to their careers and livelihoods. When the deprivation \nof a key opportunity threatens the continued viability of one’s professional standing, injunctive \nrelief is appropriate. See, e.g., Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d \nCir. 1970) (the right to continue a business “is not measurable entirely in monetary terms”); Roso-\nLino Beverage Distribs., Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 749 F.2d 124, 125-26 (2d Cir. 1984) (loss \nof  “ongoing  business  representing  many  years  of  effort  and  the  livelihood  of  its  owners” \nconstitutes irreparable harm). Moreover, “[m]ajor disruption of a business can be as harmful as \ntermination” of it, Nemer Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v. Jeep-Eagle Sales Corp., 992 F.2d 430, 435 (2d Cir. \n1993). as can “a threatened loss of good will and customers, both present and potential,” trueEX, \nLLC v. MarkitSERV Ltd., 266 F. Supp. 3d 705, 727 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). And when unlawful conduct \nthreatens the viability of a planned professional undertaking, through lost opportunities or future \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 30 of 35\n \nprospects that are inherently difficult to quantify, those harms also qualify as irreparable. See Tom \nDoherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm’t, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 38-39 (2d Cir. 1995).  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ careers face similarly irreparable harm. Their professional survival and \nadvancement depend on their sustained scholarly productivity and associated earned goodwill in \nthe academic community. The scholarship funded by the NEH grants was so essential to their \nprofessional endeavors that Plaintiffs structured their lives around them, forgoing other jobs, \ntaking  leaves  of  absence,  committing  to  months  of  grant-supported  full-time  research,  and \narranging travel for time-sensitive interviews and archival research. See Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 4–7; \nJasperse Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6–8; Orlando Decl. ¶¶ 5–6; Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 4–5; Jenkins Decl. ¶ 8; Authors \nGuild Decl. ¶ 4. For many, their grant terms expressly required them to turn down all other work. \nWith grant affiliation and funding terminated midstream or on the eve of disbursement, they are \nleft without time to replan and without viable alternatives to advance their projects and their \ncareers. See, e.g., Jasperse Decl. ¶¶ 10–11; Jenkins Decl. ¶ 14; Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 10–13; Authors \nGuild Decl. ¶ 4. \nThese harms cannot be remedied with money. To take just one example: Plaintiff Lee \nJasperse, a University of Chicago teaching fellow at the beginning of his career in academia, \nsecured a long-term NEH-funded fellowship to support the completion of his first book. Jasperse \nDecl. ¶ 2. The grant would have supported his living expenses while he conducted critical archival \nresearch at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Id. ¶ 3. But when the NEH terminated his grant, \nDr. Jasperse was left without prospective income and without institutional affiliation that would \nhave carried him into the next academic hiring cycle. He also had to stall relocation efforts that \nwere already underway, and his book is imperiled. Id. ¶¶ 5–7. His situation exemplifies the real-\nlife consequences of termination for many early-career scholars affected by the Mass Termination: \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 31 of 35\n \nthey do not have the resources to absorb the blow, and they may not get another opportunity to \nstay in the profession. \nAll plaintiffs face similar concrete, career-defining harm that cannot be remedied by later \ncompensation. Without NEH support, they cannot complete time-sensitive research critical to \nbooks, tenure, and advancement—opportunities that are not deferrable. See, e.g., Balog Decl. ¶ 6 \n(book facing “significant delay ... and more likely indefinite postponement”); Orlando Decl. ¶ 8 \n(grant-supported research travel scheduled to begin this June involves materials “not accessible \nyear-round” and “cannot be replaced by remote work”); Holtzman Decl. ¶ 9 (“These trips were \ncentral to advancing the project and may now be canceled or indefinitely delayed.”). Others face \nlost job-market opportunities and publication risks. See Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 10–12 (forced to return \nto teaching midyear and facing potential loss of expected promotion tied to NEH grant and book \ncompletion); Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11 (postponed “essential travel to archival collections” and now \nuncertain “whether I can maintain the quality and scope of the project envisioned”); Jenkins Decl. \n¶¶ 14–15 (grant loss jeopardizes book completion and undermines tenure application). For this \ncadre of scholars, an NEH fellowship or grant is not just a cash reward, it is the scaffolding for \ntheir career. Their terminations halt concrete, time-sensitive work and thrust into jeopardy hard-\nearned and significant but ephemeral career opportunities like tenure and book publication. This \ntype of harm is precisely what preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent. \nRecognizing these and similar realities, courts across the country have found that the \nTrump  Administration’s  analogous  grant  terminations  risk  irreparable  harm  absent  court \nintervention. See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 763 F.Supp.3d 36, 57 (D.D.C. 2025) \n(“Because the funding freeze threatens the lifeline that keeps countless organizations operational, \n[plaintiffs] have met their burden of showing irreparable harm.”); Massachusetts v. N.I.H., 2025 \nWL 702163, at *1, *31 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025) (NIH funding freeze that “impacts thousands of \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 32 of 35\n \nexisting grants … without regard for on-going research and clinical trials” constitutes irreparable \nharm because “it is impossible to measure the value of discovery from scientists who choose to \nleave, or of the potential students who now never become scientists at all”); AIDS Vaccine Advoc. \nCoal. v. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 752378, at *19 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (actions that “make it \nmore difficult for the [plaintiffs] to accomplish their primary mission” inflict irreparable harm); \nPacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *22–*23 (similar). The same conclusion is compelled here. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm from the viewpoint discrimination \nreflected in Defendants’ Mass Termination. “[T]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. \n347, 373 (1976).  \nIV.  The Balance Of Equities And The Public Interest Overwhelmingly Favor Relief.  \nThe balance of the equities and public interest favor granting Plaintiffs their requested \nrelief. As Congress found decades ago, “[t]he humanities belong to all the people of the United \nStates.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1). The Mass Termination deprives the public of its access to scholarship \nand  new  ideas  that,  through  careful  review,  NEH  found  would  bolster  democracy,  further \neducational endeavors, and celebrate the country’s cultural heritage. See 20 U.S.C. § 951(2)-(11); \nsee also, e.g., Jenkins Decl. ¶ 2 (“I believe the book ... will spark people to think about the beauty \nindustry and Black womanhood in ways they haven’t before.”); Holtzman Decl. ¶¶ 3, 11 (noting \nbook project “is designed to reach both scholars and a broader audience” and “deepen public \nunderstanding of the humanities and of our nation’s historical challenges”). Some of the works \nwill be lost indefinitely and, for those for which some funding already had been distributed, the \npublic may never receive the benefit of the taxpayer investment in them. See Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 5, \n11 (noting “I have received a portion of the NEH funding” but also that “I will likely be forced to \ndelay my timeline or scale back elements of the book that serve the public interest” due to the grant \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 33 of 35\n \ncancellation); Jasperse Decl. ¶ 7 (describing how his book project has “stalled”); Orlando Decl. ¶ \n8 (“Without this support, I cannot carry out the core research for my book.”).  \nThe Mass Termination also undermines the broader academic infrastructure that supports \npublic-facing scholarship. These grants do more than fund discrete projects; they serve as public \naffirmations of the value of intellectual and humanistic inquiry. Their sudden cancellation sends \nthe opposite message: that even after peer review, Council endorsement, and federal approval, a \nscholar’s project can be discarded without warning. This erodes the fundamental basis of trust \nbetween scholars and their institutions, students, and the public, and it depresses the development \nof future leaders who could contribute to societal advancement for decades to come. See Jasperse \nDecl. ¶¶ 6-9 (describing how, as a junior scholar, the loss of funding could hinder or destroy his \nfuture in his field); Orlando Decl. ¶ 10 (describing the importance of the supported research to \n“generational transmission of insight, critical thinking, and intellectual exploration”). \nThe public interest in enjoining the Mass Termination is particularly strong because “there \nis a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.” League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 \nF.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). “[T]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \nagency action.” Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C. v. HHS, 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). \nAnd while the burden on the public is great without preliminary relief, there is no harm to the \nGovernment because “the government cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an \nunlawful practice.” TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. 3d 73, 85 (D.D.C. 2020). \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court issue a preliminary injunction. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 34 of 35\n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  By:   /s/ Jamie Crooks \n Jamie Crooks (pro hac vice) \n Michael Lieberman (pro hac vice) \nAmanda R.

It achieves these ends principally by awarding grants to \nsupport scholars’ research and publication of culturally significant works. This suit involves about \n1,500 such grants, which NEH issued after its highly competitive, months-long, expert-led review \nprocess determined that the funded projects were intellectually significant, of high quality, and \nworthy of the honor and prestige of an NEH grant.  \nThen, over the course of a few days in April, two operatives from the U.S. DOGE Service \n(“DOGE”) swept into NEH and terminated the grants en masse via late-night emails sent from a \nnon-government  email  address  (the  “Mass  Termination”).  There  was  no  expert  review,  no \nindividualized assessment, and no meaningful explanation. Instead, the Mass Termination rested \non  the  conclusory  assertion  that  the  grants  “no  longer  effectuate  the  agency’s  needs  and \npriorities”—a rationale applied identically to every terminated project regardless of its subject \nmatter or merit. \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims challenging these unlawful actions. The \nMass Termination bears exactly none of the hallmarks of the reasoned agency action required by \nthe Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”). The letters attached to the termination emails provide \nno real explanation for the Mass Termination, much less one that would account for the grievous \nharms it inflicts on grantees. Instead, the letters consist of identical, boilerplate, conclusory \nstatements that cite no evidence, misidentify governing law, and ignore the substantial reliance \ninterests at stake. Equally troubling, the Mass Termination appears to target grants based on their \nperceived  viewpoints  and  association  with  the  prior  administration—a  form  of  viewpoint \ndiscrimination prohibited by the First Amendment. \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 9 of 35\n \nThe harm to Plaintiffs is both immediate and irreparable. Scholars have structured their \nprofessional lives around these grants, obtaining leaves of absence, performing substantial work \non their projects, and forgoing other opportunities in reliance on NEH’s commitment. With grant \naffiliation and funding terminated midstream or on the eve of disbursement, they are left without \ntime to replan and without viable alternatives to advance their projects and their careers. The Mass \nTermination cuts them off from rare, time-sensitive opportunities that form the basis of career \nadvancement and scholarly contribution, threatening to derail their long-term reputations and the \nvery viability of their work in the public humanities. \nFinally, the balance of harms decisively favors Plaintiffs. Defendants have no legitimate \ninterest in maintaining unlawful agency action, while the public interest lies in preserving the \nexpert-driven process that Congress established to advance the humanities and in benefitting from \nthe works that NEH grants enable. Preliminary relief is both warranted and necessary. \nSTATEMENT OF FACTS \nA.  The National Endowment for the Humanities \nThe  NEH  is  an  independent  federal  agency  that  aims  to  promote  excellence  in  the \nhumanities, convey the lessons of history, and strengthen the nation. When creating the NEH, \nCongress expressly declared that “the humanities belong to all the people of the United States,” \nand recognized that “[a]n advanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology \nalone, but must give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural \nactivity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and \na better view of the future.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1), (3).  \nTo advance this mission, Congress authorized the NEH to provide funding for individuals \nand organizations involved in research, publication of scholarly works, and promotion of the \nhumanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956. Specifically, Congress provided that the NEH may “enter into \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 10 of 35\n \narrangements,” including “contracts, grants, loans, and other forms of assistance,” to serve ten \nenumerated purposes, including “promot[ing] progress and scholarship in the humanities,” id. \n§ 956(c)(1), “foster[ing] the interchange of information in the humanities,” id. § 956(c)(6), and \n“support[ing] the publication of scholarly works in the humanities,” id. § 956(c)(8). \nOver its history, the NEH has awarded over $6 billion to support museums, historic sites, \nuniversities, teachers, libraries, documentary filmmakers, public TV and radio stations, research \ninstitutions, scholars, and local humanities programming nationwide, cementing the United States’ \nrole as a global leader in the humanities. See Lieberman Decl., Ex. A at 4. NEH grants have \nsupported the building blocks of American civil society, helping to examine the human condition, \npromote civics education, understand our cultural heritage, foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs \nand cultures, develop media and information literacy, create documentaries and podcasts, facilitate \ngroundbreaking research, and preserve and expand access to cultural and historical artifacts. Id. \nB.  The NEH’s Grant Programs \nPrior to the actions at issue in this case, the NEH offered 47 grant programs to support the \nhumanities nationwide. See Lieberman Decl., Ex. B. These programs were highly competitive and \nprestigious. Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs’ members were among the recipients of these prestigious \ngrants, including through the Public Scholars Program; the Fellowships Program; the Summer \nStipends Program; the Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs) Program; the \nAwards for Faculty at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Program; and the \nFellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions (FPIRI): \n•  Plaintiff Authors Guild is a national non-profit membership association of more \nthan 16,000 professional, published writers of all genres. Authors Guild has many \nmembers who received grants from the NEH, including grantees under the Public \nScholars, Fellowship, and Summer Stipend programs.

Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Bill Goldstein, an independent scholar, received a Public Scholars Award \nfor his biography of Larry Kramer, an AIDS activist whose work pushed the \ngovernment to confront its neglect of the AIDS crisis and helped reframe how \nmarginalized communities organize for survival.

Holtzman Decl. ¶ 3. \n•  Plaintiff Katalin Balog, a professor at Rutgers University-Newark, received a \nFellowship Award for her book exploring changes in the concept of mind during \nthe last 300 years and critiques current views on philosophical and moral grounds. \nBalog Decl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Valerie Orlando, a professor at the University of Maryland, was awarded \na Summer Stipend Award for research on a book project about history and memory \nin contemporary Algerian literature. Orlando Decl. ¶ 3. \n•  Plaintiff Nicole Jenkins, an Assistant Professor at Howard University, received an \nAward for Faculty at HBCUs to complete her book examining Black women’s \nnavigation of beauty norms, family, and Black women’s identity-making. Jenkins \nDecl. ¶ 2. \n•  Plaintiff Lee Jasperse, a Teaching Fellow at the University of Chicago, received a \nfellowship at the Massachusetts Historical Society that was supported fully by an \nFPIRI grant. Jasperse Decl. ¶ 2. \nEach of these grants was awarded after a highly competitive, expert-led review process \ndetermined that the projects were intellectually significant, of high quality, and worthy of the honor \nand prestige of an NEH grant. Each year, NEH conducted more than 200 review panels, involving \nnearly 1,000 outside experts, in its evaluation of approximately 5,700 applications across all grant \nprograms. Lieberman Decl., Ex. C. \nC.  The Mass Termination \nOn January 20, 2025, President Trump established DOGE as a new component of the \nExecutive Office of the President. E.O. 14,158 § 3(a) (Jan. 20, 2025). The Executive Order \nrequired agencies to work with a “DOGE Team Lead” who would “advise” the agency “on \nimplementing the President’s DOGE Agenda.” Id. § 3(c). In a subsequent Executive Order, the \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 12 of 35\n \nPresident directed agencies to work with DOGE to “terminate or modify ... contracts and grants to \nreduce overall Federal spending or reallocate spending to promote efficiency and advance the \npolicies of my Administration.” E.O. 14,222 § 3(b) (Feb. 26, 2025). \nIn March 2025, two DOGE operatives—Defendants Nate Cavanaugh and Justin Fox—\narrived at NEH. John Doe Decl., ECF 31 ¶ 2; Jane Doe Decl., ECF 32 ¶ 8. Cavanaugh and Fox \nmet with senior NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans for NEH’s future. Jane Doe Decl. ¶ 12. \nOn April 1, 2025, Defendant McDonald, NEH’s Acting Chairman, told NEH staff that DOGE \nsought to “claw back” $170 million in grants. Id. At the end of March or the beginning of April, \nCavanaugh and/or Fox began reviewing a list of open NEH grants and personally choosing which \ngrants would be terminated. John Doe Decl. ¶ 3; Richard Roe Decl., ECF 30 ¶ 2.  \nAcross the first few days of April, Fox emailed nearly 1,500 grantees and informed them \nthat their grants were being terminated (hereinafter, the “Mass Termination”). See Richard Roe \nDecl. ¶ 2; John Doe Decl. ¶ 3; Mark Moe Decl., ECF 50 ¶ 1. This included nearly all grants \nawarded during the Biden administration. Richard Roe Decl. ¶ 2. The termination notification to \ngrantees  did  not  come  from  an  NEH  email  address,  but  rather  from \nGrant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com. Id.; Goldstein Decl., Ex. B. The emails attached \na grant termination letter purportedly signed by McDonald. See Kadetsky Decl., Ex. B; Goldstein \nDecl., Ex. C; Holtzman Decl., Ex. D; Orlando Decl., Ex. B. \nThe termination letters received by Plaintiffs and their members as part of the Mass \nTermination were nearly identical, with boilerplate language and no specific information about \nany grantee or the reasons their specific grants were being terminated. The letters uniformly stated: \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions \nof the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable \ncauses, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, NEH has reasonable cause to \nterminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 13 of 35\n \nallocations  in  a  new  direction  in  furtherance  of  the  President’s  agenda.  The \nPresident’s February 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate all \nnon-statutorily required activities and functions. See Commencing the Reduction \nof the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate \ntermination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities…. The termination of your grant represents an urgent \npriority for the administration, and due to exceptional circumstances, adherence to \nthe traditional notification process is not possible.  \nId. Grantees who tried to appeal the termination were ignored or told that “dispute resolution was \nnot available.” Goldstein Decl. ¶ 6; Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 9; Orlando Decl. ¶ 7; Balog Decl., Ex. D. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA preliminary injunction is warranted if Plaintiffs establish (1) a likelihood of success on \nthe merits; (2) that irreparable harm is likely without preliminary relief; (3) that the balance of \nequities tips in Plaintiffs’ favor; and (4) that a preliminary injunction is in the public interest. \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008). When the government is the opposing \nparty, the final two factors merge. Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009). \nARGUMENT \nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction To Grant The Requested Relief. \nThis Court has subject matter jurisdiction and authority to grant the relief requested. As \nmany agencies have done in similar cases, however, Defendants are likely to argue that this suit \nmust be brought in the Court of Federal Claims under the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1491(a)(1). \nThis Court should reject that argument, just as courts around the country have done repeatedly in \nrecent weeks.

Apr. 11, 2025); Pacito v. \nTrump, 2025 WL 893530, at *3-*6 (W.D. Wash. Mar. 24, 2025); Am. Ass’n of Colleges for Tchr. \nEduc. v. McMahon, 2025 WL 863319, at *2-*5 (D. Md. Mar. 19, 2025) (all rejecting same \njurisdictional argument). \nA.  This Court Has Jurisdiction Over Plaintiffs’ APA Claims. \nThe APA generally waives the federal government’s immunity from lawsuits challenging \nagency action and “seeking relief other than money damages.” 5 U.S.C. § 702. That waiver covers \nthis lawsuit, which challenges agency action and seeks only declaratory and injunctive relief. See \nAm. Compl., ECF 65 at 58. Under long-established Supreme Court precedent, the fact that \ncomplying with an injunction may result in the Government’s disbursement of grant funds does \nnot transform the action into one for “money damages” under the APA. Bowen v. Massachusetts, \n487 U. S. 879, 910 (1988). As the Supreme Court recently confirmed, “a district court’s jurisdiction \nis not barred by the possibility that an order setting aside an agency’s action may result in the \ndisbursement of funds.” Dep’t of Educ. v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966 (2025) (per curiam) (quoting \nBowen, 487 U.S. at 910); see also, e.g., Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, at *6-*9. \nThe Tucker Act divests district courts of APA jurisdiction only when the plaintiff’s APA \nclaim is really a contract action in disguise—i.e., if it both involves an actual “contract” and is “‘at \nits essence’ a contract action.” Megapulse, Inc. v. Lewis, 672 F.2d 959, 968 (D.C. Cir. 1982). That \nimplied exception is narrow; courts routinely reject the “‘broad’ notion ‘that any case requiring \nsome reference to or incorporation of a contract is necessarily on the contract and therefore directly \nwithin the Tucker Act.’” Crowley Gov’t Servs., Inc. v. GSA, 38 F.4th 1099, 1107 (D.C. Cir. 2022); \nsee Atterbury v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 805 F.3d 398, 407-08 (2d Cir. 2015) (applying same test). \nThe Government’s Tucker Act argument therefore “hinges on characterizing Plaintiffs’ claims as \ndisguised contract claims rather than legitimate APA challenges.” Pacito, 2025 WL 893530, at *4.  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 15 of 35\n \nThat characterization is wrong, for two independent reasons. First, federal law carefully \ndistinguishes between “grants” and “contracts”; this case involves the former and the Tucker Act \napplies only to the latter. Second, even if NEH grants were “contracts,” there still would be no \nTucker Act jurisdiction because this lawsuit “is not ‘at its essence’ a contract action.” Megapulse, \n672 F.2d at 968. \nThis Case Does Not Involve Contracts. Before even applying the Megapulse test, the court \nmust first find that the instrument at issue is, in fact, a contract. For it to be a contract, it “must \ncontain the four required elements of offer, acceptance, consideration, and proper government \nauthority.” Am. Near E. Refugee Aid v. USAID, 703 F.Supp.3d 126, 131 (D.D.C. 2023). In this \ncontext, the “consideration” requirement is satisfied only if the instrument provides a “tangible” \nand “direct” benefit to the federal government, rather than a “generalized” or “incidental” one. Id. \nMerely advancing U.S. “policy interests” or providing a “generalized benefit” for the public is not \nenough; the benefit must be direct, such as a “financial benefit.” Id. at 133. For example, in St. \nBernard Par. Gov’t v. United States, 134 Fed. Cl. 730 (2017), the Court of Federal Claims lacked \nTucker Act jurisdiction because plaintiff’s removal of debris from public spaces did not provide a \n“direct” benefit to the government, only a “generalized benefit” to the public. Id. at 736; see also \nRefugee Aid, 703 F.Supp.3d at 132-33 (same with respect to government-funded construction of \ninfrastructure in the West Bank).1  \nLikewise  here,  NEH  grants  do  not  confer  “tangible”  and  “direct”  benefits  to  the \ngovernment,  only  “generalized”  ones  to  the  public.  NEH  grants  to  scholars,  writers,  and \n \n1 In distinguishing between contracts and other instruments, courts also look to the Federal \nGrant and Cooperative Agreements Act, 31 U.S.C. § 6301 et seq. Consistent with the cases, the \nFGCAA defines a “contract” as an instrument with the “principal purpose of … acquir[ing] … \nproperty or services for the direct benefit or use of the [] Government,” 31 U.S.C. § 6303(1), while \nit defines a “grant” as an instrument with the principal purpose of “carry[ing] out a public purpose \nof support or stimulation,” id. § 6304(1). \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 16 of 35\n \ninstitutions advance the humanities and public understanding as articulated in 20 U.S.C. § 951, \nsupporting books, research, and cultural works that benefit the general public, not the government \nspecifically. That makes NEH awards “grants” rather than “contracts.” Indeed, NEH itself has \nrecognized as much: while it has statutory authority to use both “contracts” and “grants,” 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(c), it consistently calls the awards at issue here “grants.” See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 59, 68, 75, 83, \n92 (quoting NEH website). Accordingly, the Tucker Act does not apply and does not displace this \nCourt’s jurisdiction. \nThis Is Not “At Its Essence” A Contract Claim. Even where an actual “contract” is \ninvolved, the Tucker Act precludes jurisdiction only when the plaintiff’s claim “is at its essence a \ncontract claim.” Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968. The mere fact “that a court may have to rule on a \ncontract issue does not, by triggering some mystical metamorphosis, automatically transform” an \nAPA action into a contract action. Id. Instead, to determine whether a case is “at its essence” a \ncontract action, courts consider “the source of the rights upon which the plaintiff bases its claims, \nand … the type of relief sought (or appropriate).” Id.; see Atterbury, 805 F.3d at 406 (applying this \ntest). Here, both factors favor this Court’s jurisdiction. \nFirst, Plaintiffs root their claims in federal statutes, not contract terms. They claim that \nDefendants’ actions violate the APA, the Impoundment Control Act, the NEH’s organic statute, \nand the First Amendment, not the terms of any contract. Am. Compl. ¶¶ 144-89. The “source of \nthe rights” here, Megapulse, 672 F.2d at 968, is thus not contractual. Plaintiffs are challenging \nagency overreach and failure to comply with required administrative procedures—the heartland of \nthe APA. Bowen, 487 U.S. at 904-05. Second, “the type of relief sought” differs from the relief \navailable from a Tucker Act claim. Plaintiffs are not asking the Court for money damages or \nspecific performance of grant terms, but simply to “hold unlawful and set aside agency action,” 5 \nU.S.C. § 706(2)—i.e., to set aside the Mass Termination and restore the ex ante status quo. See \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 17 of 35\n \nAm. Compl. at 58. This “is not a suit seeking money in compensation for the damage sustained by \nthe failure of the Federal Government to pay as mandated; rather, it is a suit seeking to enforce the \nstatutory mandate itself.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 900. The fact that an injunction may lead to the \ngovernment making grant payments does not strip this Court of jurisdiction. Crowley, 38 F.4th at \n1108. \nThe Government will likely argue—as it has in other cases—that the Supreme Court’s \nemergency-docket order granting a stay in Dep’t of Education v. California, 145 S. Ct. 966, \nchanges all of this. It does not. As courts have explained in rejecting that argument, California \n“announces no new rule of law”; it merely reaffirmed the long-standing rule that the APA’s waiver \nof sovereign immunity “does not extend to orders to enforce a contractual obligation to pay \nmoney.” Pacito v. Trump, 2025 WL 1077401, at *3 (W.D. Wash. Apr. 9, 2025); accord Cmty. \nLegal Servs. in E. Palo Alto v. HHS, 2025 WL 1168898, at *3 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 21, 2025) (“[T]he \nGovernment fails to identify anything different about the law following the Supreme Court’s \norder.”); Woonasquatucket River Watershed Council v. Dep’t of Agric., 2025 WL 1116157, at *14 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 15, 2025) (“The Government overreads the three-page stay order.”). As already \nexplained, Plaintiffs do not seek to enforce a contractual obligation to pay money. \nEven if California made new law, it would not apply to these facts. In California, Plaintiffs’ \nclaims put “the terms and conditions of each individual grant award [] at issue,” California v. DOE, \n132 F.4th 92, 96–97 (1st Cir. 2025), and the district court’s order “require[d] the Government to \npay out past-due grant obligations.” 145 S. Ct. at 968. Because the plaintiffs were suing based on \nthe grant terms and seeking payment of past-due sums, they were plainly seeking “to enforce a \ncontractual obligation to pay money.” California, 145 S. Ct. at 968.2 Here, in contrast, Plaintiffs’ \n \n2 The plaintiffs in DOE did not argue that their awards were not “contracts.” \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 18 of 35\n \nclaims relate to Defendants’ blanket termination of grants, not the terms and conditions of each \nindividual grant, and they seek an order setting aside agency action—the quintessential APA \nremedy—not one mandating payment of past-due sums. See Rhode Island, 2025 WL 1303868, at \n*7 (“Because the [] challenges are based on alleged statutory and constitutional violations and the \nrelief they seek is equitable, the essence of their claims are not contractual.”). \nPlaintiffs’ APA claims seek to redress harms that money damages cannot redress. A final \nreason Plaintiffs’ APA claims are properly before this Court is that, given the nonmonetary nature \nof the harms, “the doubtful and limited relief available in the Claims Court is not an adequate \nsubstitute for review in the District Court.” Bowen, 487 U.S. at 901. As discussed in more detail \nin Part III, infra, absent an injunction, Plaintiffs will suffer far more than lost dollars; they will \nlose career opportunities, the prestige and publishing opportunities associated with an NEH grant, \nand in some cases the ability to complete projects they have worked on for years. The Court of \nFederal Claims cannot issue relief for nonmonetary harms, see Nat’l Air Traffic Controllers Ass’n \nv. United States, 160 F.3d 714, 716 (Fed. Cir. 1988), making it impossible for Plaintiffs to get \n“complete relief” there, Bowen, 487 at 910. Accordingly, courts regularly hold that APA actions \nmay proceed in district court when money damages would not make plaintiffs whole. See, e.g., \nAm. Fed’n of Gov’t Emps. v. O.P.M., 2025 WL 996542, at *18 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 3, 2025). The Court \nshould hold the same here. \nB.  Plaintiffs’ Non-APA Claims Are Also Properly Before the Court. \nSeparate from their APA claims, Plaintiffs bring implied-right-of-action claims to enjoin \nthe individual Defendants’ ultra vires actions. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 163-89. These claims do not \nrely on the APA’s waiver of sovereign immunity; they proceed under the Larson-Dugan doctrine, \npursuant to which officials have no sovereign immunity from suits to enjoin them from exceeding \nconstitutional or statutory mandates. See Larson v. Domestic & Foreign Com. Corp., 337 U.S. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 19 of 35\n \n682, 689 (1949); Pieczenik v. Cambridge Antibody Tech. Grp., 2004 WL 1118500, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. \nMay 14, 2004) (noting that “no separate waiver of sovereign immunity is needed” when a \ngovernment official acts ultra vires). Like Plaintiffs’ APA claims, these claims seek only non-\nmonetary relief and could not be heard under the Tucker Act, making this the proper forum.  \nII.  Plaintiffs Have A Strong Likelihood Of Success. \nPlaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits because the Mass Termination violates the \nAPA, violates the First Amendment, and was undertaken without authority. See 725 Eatery Corp. \nv. City of N.Y., 408 F. Supp. 3d 424, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (plaintiffs “need only show a likelihood \nof success on the merits of at least one of [their] claims.”). \nA.  The Mass Termination Violated the APA. \nThe Mass Termination several times over runs afoul of the APA’s prohibition on arbitrary \nand capricious agency action. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). The APA requires an agency to provide a \nreasoned basis for its actions and to “cogently explain why it has exercised its discretion in a given \nmanner.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, \n48 (1983). An agency must “examine[] the relevant data and articulate[] a satisfactory explanation \nfor its action, including a rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.” Id. at \n43. If the agency fails “to provide even that minimal level of analysis, its action is arbitrary and \ncapricious and so cannot carry the force of law.” Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. \n211, 221 (2016); see also State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (agency action is “arbitrary and capricious if \nthe agency ... entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem” or “offered an \nexplanation ... so implausible that it could not be ... the product of agency expertise.”). Moreover, \nif an agency reverses a prior position, it must “display awareness that it is changing position,” \n“show that there are good reasons for the new policy” and, where the prior policy has engendered \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 20 of 35\n \nserious reliance interests, provide a “detailed justification” for its change of course. FCC v. Fox \nTV Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009).   \nHere,  NEH’s  justification  for  the  Mass  Termination  consists,  in  its  entirety,  of  the \nfollowing: \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions \nof the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable \ncauses, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, NEH has reasonable cause to \nterminate your grant in light of the fact that the NEH is repurposing its funding \nallocations  in  a  new  direction  in  furtherance  of  the  President’s  agenda.  The \nPresident’s February 19, 2025 executive order mandates that the NEH eliminate all \nnon-statutorily required activities and functions. See Commencing the Reduction \nof the Federal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate \ntermination is necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal government, \nincluding its fiscal priorities. \n \nKadetsky Decl., Ex. B; Goldstein Decl., Ex. C; Holtzman Decl., Ex. D; Orlando Decl., Ex. B.3 \nThis conclusory, boilerplate justification fails the APA’s bedrock requirements. \nThat the Mass Termination was arbitrary and capricious is most evident in the fact that \nDefendants canceled nearly 1,500 grants en masse with form letters. Those form letters not include \neven a basic level of analysis as to any one grant; nearly 1,500 grantees were told in boilerplate \nfashion  that their grant  “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities.” Id. Such \n“boilerplate” explanations, “devoid of ... any independent explanation, are grossly insufficient and \nfall far short of reasoned analysis.” Rhode Island, 2025 WL 1303868, at *11; see also Am. Ass’n \nof Colls., 2025 WL 833917, at *21 (“[T]he Department’s use of a template or boilerplate letter \nissued to all Grant Recipients further strengthens Plaintiffs’ argument.”). \n \n3 “[J]udicial review of agency action is limited to the grounds that the agency invoked when \nit took the action.” DHS v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal., 591 U.S. 1, 20 (2020).  Here, the \ntermination letters provide the only contemporaneous explanation for the Mass Termination. \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 21 of 35\n \nThe conclusory statements in the form letters do not provide the required “reasoned \nexplanation” for the Mass Termination. See Amerijet Int’l, Inc. v. Pistole, 753 F.3d 1343, 1352 \n(D.C. Cir. 2014) (“programmatic boilerplate” is not a “reasoned explanation”); NRDC v. Dep’t of \nEnergy, 362 F. Supp. 3d 126, 144 (S.D.N.Y. 2019) (A “conclusory statement ... falls well short of \nthe APA’s requirement that an agency provided reasoned explanation.”). They begin by asserting \nthat the grants “no longer effectuate[] the agency’s needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement,” but they do not explain what those “needs and priorities” are, what “conditions” are \nbeing referenced, or “how or why the [agency] concluded” that each individual grantee’s project \nwould not effectuate those criteria. Ass’n of Am. Univs., 2025 WL 1414135, at *12. These \n“conclusory statements do not ‘reasonably’ explain agency action.” Rhode Island, 2025 WL \n1303868, at *10; see also, e.g., Am. Assoc. of Colleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *20-21 (agency’s \nconclusory statement that grants were “inconsistent with, and no longer effectuat[ed], Department \npriorities” was not “reasonable explanation” for mass termination of grants). \nThe termination letters next assert that the grants are “subject to termination due to several \nreasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340 [sic],” but they do not specify any of the four \ndisjunctive grounds for termination in that regulation or explain the basis on which it concluded \nthat any such ground applied with respect to any particular grant. An agency cannot point to \npossible reasons for action; it must provide a reasoned explanation of why it acted: “It will not do \nfor a court to be compelled to guess at the theory underlying the agency’s action.” SEC v. Chenery \nCorp., 332 U.S. 194, 196–97 (1947); see also Am. Ass’n of Colleges, 2025 WL 833917, at *21 \n(arbitrary and capricious for termination letters to “merely list, disjunctively, five vague ways in \nwhich the specific grants at issue might be ‘inconsistent’”). That lack of clarity is compounded by \nthe termination letters’ statement that “NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new \ndirection in furtherance of the President’s agenda,” as the regulation does not list a President’s \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 22 of 35\n \nchanging preferences as one of the enumerated bases for termination. 2 C.F.R. § 200.340. And \neven if it did, Defendants again provide no explanation of how or why—or whether—they \nconcluded that any given grant was not “in furtherance of the President’s agenda.”   \nThe termination letters next state that a February 19, 2025, Executive Order “mandates that \nthe NEH eliminate all non-statutorily required activities and functions,” but the cited Executive \nOrder does not even mention the NEH, let alone “mandate” any action with respect to NEH grants. \nThis “disconnect between the decision made and the explanation given” is the very definition of \n“arbitrary.” Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, 785 (2019). And even if the E.O. mentioned \nthe NEH, the letters still do “not show[] that any analysis was conducted to determine which \n‘[activities] and functions’ of [NEH] are statutorily required, and which are not.” Rhode Island, \n2025 WL 1303868, at *10.  \nThe letters claim that termination is “necessary to safeguard the interests of the federal \ngovernment, including its fiscal priorities,” but, again, provide no explanation for why that is the \ncase or why it provides a basis for termination. Indeed, it is nonsensical to claim “fiscal priorities” \nare safeguarded by abandoning projects after significant taxpayer investment but before they are \ncompleted and made available to enrich the public. Stating an “aspirational goal[]” of saving \nmoney is “not the same as reasoned explanations for why an action is chosen or how the chosen \naction will effectuate the stated goals.” Ass’n of Am. Univs., 2025 WL 1414135, at *12. \nDefendants also failed to provide sufficient reasons for their change in policy and consider \ngrantees’  “serious  reliance  interests.”  Regents  of  the  Univ.  of  California,  591  U.S.  at  30. \nDefendants provided no “reasoned explanation” for why NEH “change[d] course,” id., reversing \nnearly 1,500 decisions it had previously made through a rigorous, expert-guided review process. \nNor could it. Defendant McDonald admitted in an NEH staff meeting that the Mass Termination \nwas completely untethered from any consideration of each grant’s merits. Instead, the agency’s \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 23 of 35\n \n“rationale” for the change in course “was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at \nother agencies and they applied the same methodology here.”4  \nDefendants also did not consider, or even acknowledge, the reliance interests of grantees, \nwhich are significant. See Fox, 556 U.S. at 515-16 (explaining that it is arbitrary and capricious to \nignore reliance interests). For example, many grantees already spent significant time and resources \non funded projects put in jeopardy by Defendants’ change of course. See, e.g., Holtzman Decl. \n¶¶ 7, 9; Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 5, 7. Likewise, many abandoned other funding and employment \nopportunities to work on the grant-funded projects. See, e.g., Goldstein Decl. ¶ 4; Jenkins Decl. ¶¶ \n7-9; Kadetsky Decl. ¶ 7; Jasperse Decl. ¶ 4; see also infra Part III (detailing other actions taken in \nreliance on grants). Defendants did not acknowledge any of these reliance interests, much less \nprovide a reasoned basis for acting despite them. Defendants’ failure to “assess the reliance \ninterests” violates the APA. Pacito, 2025 WL 893530, at *11; see Colorado, 2025 WL 1426226, \nat *17. \n Defendants’ actions are also arbitrary and capricious because their stated justification “is \nso implausible that it could not be . . . the product of agency expertise.”  State Farm, 463 U.S. at \n43. It is utterly implausible that almost 1,500 projects suddenly and all at once stopped furthering \n“agency priorities”—i.e., advancing the humanities—despite having been selected from among \nthousands of applications as the most meritorious humanities projects. Indeed, far from relying on \nagency expertise, Defendants expressly eschewed the NEH’s standard, expert-guided process for \nevaluating  grant  applications.  Richard  Roe  Decl.  ¶¶  1-2;  John  Doe  Decl.  ¶  3.  The  Mass \nTermination was instead directed by Defendants Cavanaugh and Fox, two DOGE staffers who \n \n4 Recording, 4/3/2025 NEH Meeting, \nhttps://www.rev.com/app/transcript/NjgxMTE2MjgzOGFiYWRjZGM5NTIxYjk5ZEpYN0hBcV\nNYY0xJ/o/VEMwNDc3NTI1NjEz/transcript (last accessed May 23, 2025). \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 24 of 35\n \nappeared at the agency only days before implementing it, John Doe Decl. ¶ 3, and who do not \npurport to be experts in evaluating humanities projects. Nothing in the record suggests they (or \nanyone with humanities expertise) evaluated the scholarly or artistic merit of any of the projects \nbefore the Mass Termination. \nDefendants’ actions were arbitrary and capricious in other respects as well. Defendants \n“entirely failed to consider … important aspect[s] of the problem,” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43, \nincluding the significant consequences the termination will have on the grantees, the state(s), and \ncongressional district(s) in which the works are being produced, and the broader public that would \nbenefit from completion and release of the funded works. Defendants also “offered an explanation \nfor [the] decision that runs counter to the evidence before the agency.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. \nAs NEH itself previously determined, the evidence showed that each grantee’s project was worthy \nof an NEH grant. No new evidence came before the agency; it simply ignored the evidence on \nwhich it had previously relied and terminated the grants en masse. Finally, Defendants failed to \nconsider whether the Mass Termination would advance NEH’s statutory purposes, 20 U.S.C. \n§§ 951, 956. Agencies are “bound ... by the ultimate purposes Congress has selected,” New York \nv. DHS, 969 F.3d 42, 82 (2d Cir. 2020), but Defendants failed entirely to consider how its Mass \nTermination could possibly advance Congress’s purposes to, e.g., “develop and encourage the \npursuit of a national policy for the promotion of progress and scholarship in the humanities,” 20 \nU.S.C. § 956(c)(1). \nFor all these reasons, Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the grounds that Defendants acted \nunreasonably, arbitrarily, and capriciously in terminating Plaintiffs’ grants. \nB.  The Mass Termination Violated the First Amendment. \nThe First Amendment rests on “[t]he bedrock principle of viewpoint neutrality,” which \n“demands that the state not suppress speech” due to “disagreement with the underlying ideology \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 25 of 35\n \nor perspective that the speech expresses.” Ridley v. Mass. Bay Transp. Auth., 390 F.3d 65, 82 (1st \nCir. 2004). Even “in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not ‘aim at the suppression’” \nof ideas it disfavors. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998). The NEH’s \ncharge is to make value-based judgments about which projects will advance “progress and \nscholarship in the humanities,” 20 U.S.C. § 956(c)(1), not to “leverage[s] its power to award \nsubsidies … into a penalty on disfavored viewpoints.” Finley, 524 U.S. at 587. \nFinley in particular is instructive. There, the Supreme Court upheld a provision requiring \nthe National Endowment for the Arts to consider “general standards of decency and respect” in \nawarding grants, finding that the requirement was “merely hortatory.” 524 U.S. at 580. But it made \nclear that it “would confront a different case” if an agency were to deny grants to projects because \nthey expressed disfavored viewpoints. Id. at 587. Even in the context of a public grant program, \nthe government may not impose “a disproportionate burden calculated to drive ‘certain ideas or \nviewpoints from the marketplace,’” or “threaten[] to suppress the expression of particular ideas or \nviewpoints.’” Id. \nDecisions regarding other government benefits echo this rule. Congress may not condition \nits funding of the Legal Services Corporation on its attorneys’ agreement not to express viewpoints \nthe government disfavors. Legal Servs. Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 540-49 (2001). Congress \nlikewise may not impose viewpoint-based restrictions on granting the government benefit of a \ntrademark. Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). Cities may not withdraw funding from a \nmuseum “because of the perceived viewpoint of the works.” Brooklyn Inst. of Arts & Scis. v. City \nof New York, 64 F. Supp. 2d 184, 202 (E.D.N.Y. 1999). And cities likewise may not discontinue \nan organization’s arts funding because of the organization’s viewpoints on social issues. Esperanza \nPeace & Justice Center v. San Antonio, 316 F. Supp. 2d 433, 447-56 (W.D. Tex. 2001). \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 26 of 35\n \nIn violation of those principles, Defendants withdrew funding from projects they believed \npromoted or were associated with viewpoints they disfavor. The sequence of events surrounding \nthe Mass Termination and Defendants’ proffered justifications make that unmistakable. During \nthe Biden Administration, NEH awarded grants to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class \nafter concluding that the speech and thought reflected in their projects constituted “contributions \nto the humanities” that would advance the agency’s statutory purposes. E.g., Kadetsky Decl., Ex. \nA. Then, after a change in administration, Defendants began terminating those grants en masse, \nnot based on a reassessment of their contributions to the humanities but, it appears, on their \nperceived viewpoints and associations—ultimately terminating almost every grant awarded during \nthe prior administration. See Richard Roe Decl. ¶ 2. \nFirst, in February 2025, before the Mass Termination, NEH staff was informed that grants \nwould be terminated if they expressed any disfavored viewpoints—i.e., if they “violated the new \nExecutive Orders on K-12 education, gender ideology, and DEI.” Id. ¶ 1.5 Those Executive Orders \nrefer to disfavored views on these subjects as “illegal and immoral,” DEI EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8839; “corrosive … on the validity of the entire American system,” Gender EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at \n8615; and “anti-American, subversive, harmful, and false,” Schooling EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8853. \nThe DEI EO and Gender EO highlight the Biden Administration’s association with and support \nfor these disfavored ideas. See DEI EO, 90 Fed. Reg. at 8839; Gender EO, 90 Fed. Reg., at 8616. \nMany of the termination letters issued to implement the Mass Termination cited those same \nExecutive Orders. See, e.g., Ex. B, Kadetsky Decl.  \n \n5 The referenced Executive Orders are Exec. Order No. 14151, Ending Radical and Wasteful \nGovernment DEI Programs and Preferencing, 90 Fed. Reg. 8339 (Jan. 20, 2025) (“DEI EO”); \nExec. Order No. 14168, Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring \nBiological Truth to the Federal Government, 90 Fed. Reg. 8615, (Jan. 20, 2025) (“Gender EO”); \nand Exec. Order No. 14190, Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling, 90 Fed. Reg. 8853 \n(Jan. 29, 2025) (“Schooling EO”).   \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 27 of 35\n \nMoreover, shortly after the Mass Termination, NEH released a statement that it had \nterminated awards “at variance with agency priorities, including but not limited to those on \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion, and environmental justice,” Lieberman Decl., Ex. D, confirming \nthat the termination was not based on humanistic merit, but to root out disfavored viewpoints. At \nthe same time, NEH began specifically soliciting projects that promote viewpoints favored by \nDefendants, such as projects that “promote” the Nation’s “record of advancing liberty” and the \nidea of “American exceptionalism.”  Lieberman Decl., Ex. E at 1. NEH further noted that while \nprojects on “the suffragist movement or a history of conservation policies in the United States” \nmight be allowed grant funding, those deemed unfavorable by the Administration would not. \nLieberman Decl., Ex. D. The Mass Termination therefore was not a termination of all projects \ntouching on gender or race or the environment, but of projects Defendants perceived as having a \ndisfavored viewpoint on those topics. That is textbook viewpoint discrimination.  \nTo be clear, Plaintiffs’ projects did not promote any particular political, religious, or \nideological points of view—their grant terms prohibited as much. Yet, given the absence of any \nindividualized  analysis,  the  termination  of  almost  every  grant  issued  during  the  Biden \nAdministration,  and  the  repeated  references  to  disfavored  viewpoints  associated  with  that \nadministration, it appears that Defendants broadly (and haphazardly) acted on their belief that any \ngrantee’s association with an opposing political party’s administration meant  they espoused \ndisfavored views. Even if “the [government] makes a factual mistake about” the speaker’s \nmessage, it violates the First Amendment when it rescinds funding based on its perception of the \nspeaker’s message or associations. Heffernan v. City of Paterson, 578 U.S. 266, 272 (2016); see \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 28 of 35\n \nFinley, 524 U.S. at 580.6 Defendants’ “selections among recipients of public subsidies that favor \nand strengthen those friendly to the government’s message while placing at a disadvantage and \nthus weakening the opponents and skeptics” is the kind of hand on the scale that is constitutionally \nverboten. Alliance for Open Soc’y Int’l, Inc. v. USAID, 430 F.Supp.2d 222, 258 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); \nsee also Rhode Island Latino Arts v. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts, 2025 WL 1009026, at *14 \n(D.R.I. Apr. 3, 2025).7 \nDefendants’ termination of grants based on association with a prior administration has a \nparticularly coercive effect, as it discourages grantees from even associating with groups that \nmight have views disfavored by the current administration. Thus, the manner of the termination \nextends its impact beyond these particular grants and into Plaintiffs’ associational choices, even in \nunrelated contexts. That interference with Plaintiffs’ associational rights is likewise prohibited. \nSee Alliance for Open Society, 570 U.S. at 218 (invalidating a requirement that a federal grantee \nbroadly adopt a specific policy position because “the condition by its very nature affects ‘protected \nconduct outside the scope of the federally funded program’”). \nC.  The Mass Termination Was Ultra Vires. \nPlaintiffs join in and incorporate by reference the arguments in Part A.5 (pp. 18-20) of the \nMemorandum in Support of Plaintiffs’ Motion for Preliminary Injunction in the consolidated case, \n \n6 Defendants’ failure to assess each project individually before labeling it as disfavored \nspeech is yet another reason the Mass Termination was arbitrary and capricious. \n7 Some courts have rejected direct, facial First Amendment challenges to the DEI and \nGender EOs, while recognizing that their conclusions may be different in as-applied challenges. \nSee, e.g., Nat’l Urb. League v. Trump, 2025 WL 1275613, at *26 (D.D.C. May 2, 2025) (rejecting \nfacial challenge but “reserve[ing] judgment on the merits of any as-applied challenges to specific \nenforcement actions”); see also Latino Arts, 2025 WL 1009026, at *14 (in as-applied challenge, \nfinding “clear First Amendment violation”). In any event, Plaintiffs are not directly challenging \nthe Executive Orders, or even their application.  Instead, the Executive Orders provide evidence \nthat Defendants used the Mass Termination to suppress particular viewpoints. \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 29 of 35\n \nNo. 1:25-cv-03657, which argues that the Mass Termination was unconstitutional because DOGE \nhas no legal authority to terminate another agency’s grants. See ECF 52 (noting that Plaintiffs may \n“join the motion for a preliminary injunction” in the consolidated case). \nIII.  The Mass Termination Is Inflicting Irreparable Harm.  \nPlaintiffs—public  scholars,  literary  researchers,  cultural  historians,  and  early-career \nacademics—face irreparable harm to their career trajectories and their immediate livelihoods. \nThey stand to lose not only the support needed to complete individual projects, but the foundational \nopportunities that make a career in the humanities possible. These harms cannot be reversed later \nwith money damages or delayed resolution. They are, in the clearest legal sense, irreparable. \nSeparately, Plaintiffs’ First Amendment injuries constitute immediate, irreparable harm as a matter \nof law. The Mass Termination has thus caused, and will continue to cause, harm that is “actual and \nimminent, not remote or speculative,” and incapable of being remedied by money alone. Freedom \nHoldings, Inc. v. Spitzer, 408 F.3d 112, 114 (2d Cir. 2005). \nFirst, Plaintiffs face irreparable harm to their careers and livelihoods. When the deprivation \nof a key opportunity threatens the continued viability of one’s professional standing, injunctive \nrelief is appropriate. See, e.g., Semmes Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 429 F.2d 1197, 1205 (2d \nCir. 1970) (the right to continue a business “is not measurable entirely in monetary terms”); Roso-\nLino Beverage Distribs., Inc. v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 749 F.2d 124, 125-26 (2d Cir. 1984) (loss \nof  “ongoing  business  representing  many  years  of  effort  and  the  livelihood  of  its  owners” \nconstitutes irreparable harm). Moreover, “[m]ajor disruption of a business can be as harmful as \ntermination” of it, Nemer Jeep-Eagle, Inc. v. Jeep-Eagle Sales Corp., 992 F.2d 430, 435 (2d Cir. \n1993). as can “a threatened loss of good will and customers, both present and potential,” trueEX, \nLLC v. MarkitSERV Ltd., 266 F. Supp. 3d 705, 727 (S.D.N.Y. 2017). And when unlawful conduct \nthreatens the viability of a planned professional undertaking, through lost opportunities or future \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 30 of 35\n \nprospects that are inherently difficult to quantify, those harms also qualify as irreparable. See Tom \nDoherty Assocs., Inc. v. Saban Entm’t, Inc., 60 F.3d 27, 38-39 (2d Cir. 1995).  \nHere, Plaintiffs’ careers face similarly irreparable harm. Their professional survival and \nadvancement depend on their sustained scholarly productivity and associated earned goodwill in \nthe academic community. The scholarship funded by the NEH grants was so essential to their \nprofessional endeavors that Plaintiffs structured their lives around them, forgoing other jobs, \ntaking  leaves  of  absence,  committing  to  months  of  grant-supported  full-time  research,  and \narranging travel for time-sensitive interviews and archival research. See Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 4–7; \nJasperse Decl. ¶¶ 4, 6–8; Orlando Decl. ¶¶ 5–6; Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 4–5; Jenkins Decl. ¶ 8; Authors \nGuild Decl. ¶ 4. For many, their grant terms expressly required them to turn down all other work. \nWith grant affiliation and funding terminated midstream or on the eve of disbursement, they are \nleft without time to replan and without viable alternatives to advance their projects and their \ncareers. See, e.g., Jasperse Decl. ¶¶ 10–11; Jenkins Decl. ¶ 14; Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 10–13; Authors \nGuild Decl. ¶ 4. \nThese harms cannot be remedied with money. To take just one example: Plaintiff Lee \nJasperse, a University of Chicago teaching fellow at the beginning of his career in academia, \nsecured a long-term NEH-funded fellowship to support the completion of his first book. Jasperse \nDecl. ¶ 2. The grant would have supported his living expenses while he conducted critical archival \nresearch at the Massachusetts Historical Society. Id. ¶ 3. But when the NEH terminated his grant, \nDr. Jasperse was left without prospective income and without institutional affiliation that would \nhave carried him into the next academic hiring cycle. He also had to stall relocation efforts that \nwere already underway, and his book is imperiled. Id. ¶¶ 5–7. His situation exemplifies the real-\nlife consequences of termination for many early-career scholars affected by the Mass Termination: \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 31 of 35\n \nthey do not have the resources to absorb the blow, and they may not get another opportunity to \nstay in the profession. \nAll plaintiffs face similar concrete, career-defining harm that cannot be remedied by later \ncompensation. Without NEH support, they cannot complete time-sensitive research critical to \nbooks, tenure, and advancement—opportunities that are not deferrable. See, e.g., Balog Decl. ¶ 6 \n(book facing “significant delay ... and more likely indefinite postponement”); Orlando Decl. ¶ 8 \n(grant-supported research travel scheduled to begin this June involves materials “not accessible \nyear-round” and “cannot be replaced by remote work”); Holtzman Decl. ¶ 9 (“These trips were \ncentral to advancing the project and may now be canceled or indefinitely delayed.”). Others face \nlost job-market opportunities and publication risks. See Kadetsky Decl. ¶¶ 10–12 (forced to return \nto teaching midyear and facing potential loss of expected promotion tied to NEH grant and book \ncompletion); Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 7, 11 (postponed “essential travel to archival collections” and now \nuncertain “whether I can maintain the quality and scope of the project envisioned”); Jenkins Decl. \n¶¶ 14–15 (grant loss jeopardizes book completion and undermines tenure application). For this \ncadre of scholars, an NEH fellowship or grant is not just a cash reward, it is the scaffolding for \ntheir career. Their terminations halt concrete, time-sensitive work and thrust into jeopardy hard-\nearned and significant but ephemeral career opportunities like tenure and book publication. This \ntype of harm is precisely what preliminary injunctions are designed to prevent. \nRecognizing these and similar realities, courts across the country have found that the \nTrump  Administration’s  analogous  grant  terminations  risk  irreparable  harm  absent  court \nintervention. See, e.g., Nat’l Council of Nonprofits v. OMB, 763 F.Supp.3d 36, 57 (D.D.C. 2025) \n(“Because the funding freeze threatens the lifeline that keeps countless organizations operational, \n[plaintiffs] have met their burden of showing irreparable harm.”); Massachusetts v. N.I.H., 2025 \nWL 702163, at *1, *31 (D. Mass. Mar. 5, 2025) (NIH funding freeze that “impacts thousands of \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 32 of 35\n \nexisting grants … without regard for on-going research and clinical trials” constitutes irreparable \nharm because “it is impossible to measure the value of discovery from scientists who choose to \nleave, or of the potential students who now never become scientists at all”); AIDS Vaccine Advoc. \nCoal. v. Dep’t of State, 2025 WL 752378, at *19 (D.D.C. Mar. 10, 2025) (actions that “make it \nmore difficult for the [plaintiffs] to accomplish their primary mission” inflict irreparable harm); \nPacito, 2025 WL 655075, at *22–*23 (similar). The same conclusion is compelled here. \nIn addition, Plaintiffs have suffered irreparable harm from the viewpoint discrimination \nreflected in Defendants’ Mass Termination. “[T]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even \nminimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.” Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. \n347, 373 (1976).  \nIV.  The Balance Of Equities And The Public Interest Overwhelmingly Favor Relief.  \nThe balance of the equities and public interest favor granting Plaintiffs their requested \nrelief. As Congress found decades ago, “[t]he humanities belong to all the people of the United \nStates.” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1). The Mass Termination deprives the public of its access to scholarship \nand  new  ideas  that,  through  careful  review,  NEH  found  would  bolster  democracy,  further \neducational endeavors, and celebrate the country’s cultural heritage. See 20 U.S.C. § 951(2)-(11); \nsee also, e.g., Jenkins Decl. ¶ 2 (“I believe the book ... will spark people to think about the beauty \nindustry and Black womanhood in ways they haven’t before.”); Holtzman Decl. ¶¶ 3, 11 (noting \nbook project “is designed to reach both scholars and a broader audience” and “deepen public \nunderstanding of the humanities and of our nation’s historical challenges”). Some of the works \nwill be lost indefinitely and, for those for which some funding already had been distributed, the \npublic may never receive the benefit of the taxpayer investment in them. See Goldstein Decl. ¶¶ 5, \n11 (noting “I have received a portion of the NEH funding” but also that “I will likely be forced to \ndelay my timeline or scale back elements of the book that serve the public interest” due to the grant \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 33 of 35\n \ncancellation); Jasperse Decl. ¶ 7 (describing how his book project has “stalled”); Orlando Decl. ¶ \n8 (“Without this support, I cannot carry out the core research for my book.”).  \nThe Mass Termination also undermines the broader academic infrastructure that supports \npublic-facing scholarship. These grants do more than fund discrete projects; they serve as public \naffirmations of the value of intellectual and humanistic inquiry. Their sudden cancellation sends \nthe opposite message: that even after peer review, Council endorsement, and federal approval, a \nscholar’s project can be discarded without warning. This erodes the fundamental basis of trust \nbetween scholars and their institutions, students, and the public, and it depresses the development \nof future leaders who could contribute to societal advancement for decades to come. See Jasperse \nDecl. ¶¶ 6-9 (describing how, as a junior scholar, the loss of funding could hinder or destroy his \nfuture in his field); Orlando Decl. ¶ 10 (describing the importance of the supported research to \n“generational transmission of insight, critical thinking, and intellectual exploration”). \nThe public interest in enjoining the Mass Termination is particularly strong because “there \nis a substantial public interest ‘in having governmental agencies abide by the federal laws that \ngovern their existence and operations.” League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 \nF.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. 2016). “[T]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \nagency action.” Planned Parenthood of N.Y.C. v. HHS, 337 F. Supp. 3d 308, 343 (S.D.N.Y. 2018). \nAnd while the burden on the public is great without preliminary relief, there is no harm to the \nGovernment because “the government cannot suffer harm from an injunction that merely ends an \nunlawful practice.” TikTok Inc. v. Trump, 490 F. Supp. 3d 73, 85 (D.D.C. 2020). \nCONCLUSION \nPlaintiffs respectfully request that this Court issue a preliminary injunction. \n \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 65-1     Filed 05/23/25     Page 34 of 35\n \n  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  By:   /s/ Jamie Crooks \n Jamie Crooks (pro hac vice) \n Michael Lieberman (pro hac vice) \nAmanda R.

INTRODUCTION \n1.  “For  more  than  fifty  years,  our  federal  agency  has  underwritten \nhundreds of the nation’s most significant humanities projects through its awards to \nindividual scholars, writers, and other researchers.” So wrote Defendant National \nEndowment  for  the  Humanities  (“NEH”)  when  it  awarded  Plaintiff  Elizabeth \nKadetsky and 24 others prestigious “Public Scholars” grants in 2024. These Public \nScholars grantees were among more than 1,400 recipients of NEH grants of various \nkinds for the 2024 grant cycle. \n2.  NEH also told Prof. Kadetsky that, in that “highly competitive funding \ncycle,” only 9 percent of applicants to her program were awarded NEH grants. The \nprocess  involved  “multi-step  review,”  including  outside  subject-matter  experts \nreviewing  the application and  advising NEH  of its merit;  NEH  reporting  those \nreviews to the National Council on the Humanities; and that Council then advising \nthe NEH Director on the relative merits of the thousands of grant applications the \nagency  had  received  that  year.  Prof.  Kadetsky  was  to  be  awarded,  the  letter \ncontinued, $60,000 to complete her book Theft of the Divine: Seven Goddesses, A \nTemple Heist, and Smuggling in Midcentury America, which would use the case study \nof a 1962 temple theft to explore the cultural landscape in the US and India that led \nto a flourishing trade in antiquities that implicated America’s top museums and most \nesteemed art collectors. Panelists on Prof. Kadetsky’s review panel described her \nproject as a “surprising, original, and compelling narrative about museums, ethics, \nand repatriation by an accomplished fiction writer with a journalistic bent” and \npredicted that “the topic of her project - who owns objects? - and the current debates \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 3 of 60\n \nand efforts over repatriation would seem to ensure an audience for her book.” \n3.  For Prof. Kadetsky, like all NEH grantees, this was a hugely important \nmilestone in her career. Scholars like her receive more from an NEH grant than just \na financial stipend to support their project—they win scholarly prestige and new \ncareer opportunities. For Prof. Kadetsky, for example, an NEH grant is one of only \nfour grants that her employer (Penn State University) considers to be a “prestigious \nfellowship,” which means  one for  which the  university  will  cover  the  difference \nbetween the grant amount and the grantee’s salary. (The other three are grants from \nthe National Endowment for the Arts, from the Guggenheim, and from the American \nCouncil  of  Learned  Societies).  Furthermore,  NEH  grants  are  an  important \nconsideration that universities like Penn State take into account when deciding \nwhether  to  award  tenure  or  other  academic  accolades  like  a  distinguished \nprofessorship. Projects funded by NEH grants also enjoy an enormous advantage \nwhen it comes to publication and distribution, because publishers desire to publish \nworks that have been vetted by expert committees like those NEH employed when \nevaluating grants. \n4.  Prof. Kadetsky’s grant period was set to begin on May 1, 2025, and last \nthrough April 30, 2026. Because hers was a “full-time” grant, as a condition of \nreceiving the $60,000 in grant money she was required by NEH to take a year-long \nleave of absence from her employment to work on the project. Penn State happily \npermitted her to take leave (and, as noted above, would pay her $35,000 while on \nleave) in light of the benefit the university would receive from employing an NEH \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 4 of 60\n \ngrantee. The two parties made arrangements for Prof. Kadetsky to take a two-\nsemester leave of absence during which she would write the book she was given a \ngrant to complete.  \n5.  Then, on April 3, 2025, Prof. Kadetsky received a letter, purportedly \ndrafted by NEH and signed by Defendant Michael McDonald, the newly appointed \nActing Director of NEH. Addressed to “Dear NEH Grantee,” the letter stated that \nProf. Kadetsky’s grant “no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and \nconditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to several \nreasonable causes.” The letter went on to note, “The President’s February 19, 2025 \nexecutive  order  mandates  that  the  NEH  eliminate  all  non-statutorily  required \nactivities  and  functions.”  (citing  Commencing  the  Reduction  of  the  Federal \nBureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025)). (That Executive Order makes no mention \nof NEH or its grants.) “The termination of your grant,” NEH’s letter continued, \n“represents  an  urgent  priority  for  the  administration,  and  due  to  exceptional \ncircumstances,  adherence  to  the  traditional  notification  process  is  not  possible. \nTherefore, the NEH hereby terminates your grant in its entirety effective April 3, \n2025”—the date the letter was issued. The letter concluded by providing a non-\ngovernment email address which Prof. Kadetsky could contact—but “with only urgent \nquestions.” \n6.  Plaintiff  Kadetsky  was  not  the  only  grantee  to  receive  this  letter \n(hereinafter, “Termination Notice”). As part of a blanket campaign to cancel most or \nall NEH grants, Defendants sent at least 1,400 grantees the same Termination Notice \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 5 of 60\n \nbetween April 1 and April 3, 2025, including other named Plaintiffs in this action, \nmany of Plaintiff Authors Guild’s members, all members of the Proposed Individual \nGrantee Class, as well as state humanities councils and other institutions (the “Mass \nTermination”). According to public reporting, this amounted to a blanket cancellation \nof more than 85 percent of NEH’s current grants—approximately $175 million of \ncongressionally appropriated and already awarded money withheld from grantees \nlike Prof. Kadetsky. NEH implemented the Mass Termination at the direction of \nDefendant United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”), whose employees—specifically \nDefendants Fox and Cavanaugh—had just days earlier obtained access to NEH’s \ngrant database and thereafter implemented the Mass Termination. \n7.  Defendants’ decision to implement the Mass Termination and issue the \nTermination Notices was not only utterly unexpected and unprecedented—it was \nflagrantly unlawful. The Mass Termination violated the Administrative Procedure \nAct, because (a) Defendants’ unreasoned, unexplained departure from prior agency \npolicy to cancel all grants regardless of circumstances was arbitrary and capricious, \nand (2) Defendants are withholding and redirecting money Congress appropriated for \ngrantees like Plaintiffs, in violation of multiple statutes. The Mass Termination also \nviolated the Impoundment Control Act and multiple appropriations statutes, which \nrequire the President to spend money Congress has appropriated for a particular \nprogram on that program, and not redirect that money to an unrelated program \nsimply to better fit the President’s preferences. Defendants’ actions also violated the \nseparation of powers, which similarly prohibits the Executive Branch from overriding \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 6 of 60\n \nappropriations statutes simply because the President would prefer to spend the \nmoney  differently.  Defendants’  Mass  Termination  also  violated  the  First \nAmendment, because the Termination Notice and other evidence make clear that the \nExecutive Branch disfavors the grantees’ speech based on its assessment of that \nspeech’s content and viewpoint. As sparse as it is, the Termination Notice’s citation \nto various executive orders relating to “Radical Indoctrination,” “Biological Truth,” \nand “DEI Programs” reveals that NEH canceled Plaintiffs’ grants because it believes \nPlaintiffs’  scholarship  conflicts  with  the  preferred  viewpoint  of  the  incumbent \nAdministration. While the Administration is free to issue its own speech to forward \nits  preferred  narrative,  it  may  not  seek  to  drive  ideas  it  disfavors  from  the \nmarketplace. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 587 (1998) \n(“[E]ven  in  the  provision  of  subsidies,  the  Government  may  not  ‘ai[m]  at  the \nsuppression of dangerous ideas.’” (alteration in original, citation omitted)). Finally, \nthe  Mass  Termination  was  carried  out  by  Defendant  DOGE  and  employees, \nspecifically  Defendants  Cavanaugh,  and  Fox,  who  lack  statutory  authority  to \nterminate NEH grants or make other institutional decisions of NEH. \n8.  Plaintiffs, on their own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated, \nbring this action to request that the Court declare unlawful and set aside the Mass \nTermination and accompanying Termination Notices, and enjoin Defendants from \nfurther actions that violate NEH’s governing statute, the Administrative Procedures \nAct (“APA”), the Impoundment Control Act, and the Constitution. \nII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n9.  This action arises under the APA, 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706, federal statutory \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 7 of 60\n \nlaw, and the Constitution. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 \nU.S.C. § 1331 and the APA. \n10.  Venue is proper in this District under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(e)(1), because \nDefendants are agencies of the United States and officers of the United States acting \nin their official capacity, and Plaintiff Authors Guild, many of whose members have \nhad their NEH grants cancelled, is headquartered in this District. Further, Plaintiffs \nKatalin Balog and Bill Goldstein reside in this District. Moreover, a substantial part \nof the events or omissions giving rise to the claims occurred in this District. \nIII.  PARTIES \n11.  Plaintiff The Authors Guild was founded in 1912 and is a national non-\nprofit membership association of more than 14,000 professional, published writers of \nall genres. The Guild, which is headquartered in New York City, counts historians, \nbiographers, academics, journalists, and other writers of non-fiction and fiction as \nmembers. The Guild works to promote the rights and professional interest of authors \nin various areas, including copyright, freedom of expression, and fair contracts. In \naddition, it assists members who have not received agreed funds for their work seek \nrelief. Many Guild members earn their livelihoods through their writing. Their work \ncovers important issues in history, biography, science, politics, medicine, business, \nand other areas; they are frequent contributors to the most influential and well-\nrespected publications in every field. The Authors Guild has many members who \nreceived  grants  from  NEH,  including  grantees  under  NEH’s  Public  Scholars, \nFellowship,  and  Summer  Stipend  programs  whose  grants  were  purportedly \nterminated by Defendants as part of the Mass Termination. The Authors Guild brings \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 8 of 60\n \nthis case in its associational capacity. \n12.  Plaintiff Elizabeth Kadetsky is a professor in the English department at \nPenn State University. NEH awarded her a Public Scholars grant for $60,000 with a \ngrant period scheduled to begin on May 1, 2025, but NEH terminated the grant on \nApril 3, 2025. \n13.  Plaintiff Dr. Valerie Orlando is the Head of Department and Professor \nof French & Francophone Literatures and Cultures at the University of Maryland, \nCollege Park. She is the author of six books, including The Algerian New Novel: The \nPoetics of a Modern Nation, 1950-1979 (2017), New African Cinema (2017), and \nScreening Morocco: Contemporary Film in a Changing Society (2011). She publishes \narticles in French and English on a wide variety of subjects in the areas of Literary \nStudies, Women’s Studies, African Cinema, and French and Francophone Studies, \nspecifically focusing on Africa and the Caribbean. Since 2004, she has worked as \nSeries Editor for After the Empire: The Francophone World and Postcolonial France \nwith Lexington Books. \n14.  After a highly competitive application process, Dr. Orlando was awarded \nan NEH Summer Stipend of $6,000 for research for a book project on the themes of \nhistory and memory in contemporary Algerian literature published in the 2000s. Her \naward was to be dispersed on June 1, 2025, and would have allowed her to travel to \nAlgeria and France to conduct interviews and archival research to help launch the \nbook project. However, on April 3, 2025, she received the Termination Notice. As a \nresult  of the  termination,  her  book has had  to  be  put  on hold  and,  unless  the \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 9 of 60\n \ntermination is rescinded or invalidated, she will be unable to complete the necessary \nresearch  during  the  summer,  when  she  does  not  have  teaching  duties  at  her \nuniversity and is able to travel. The termination of her Summer Stipend denies her a \nprestigious, highly competitive award and achievement that would have conferred \nprofessional benefits and helped with publication, promotion, and further funding of \nher book project. \n15.  Plaintiff  Katalin  Balog  is  a  professor  of  philosophy  at  Rutgers \nUniversity-Newark. Her primary areas of research and teaching are the philosophy \nof mind and philosophy of psychology. She resides in this District. Prof. Balog was \nawarded a grant under NEH’s Fellowships program to conduct research and writing \nleading to a book on philosophy and consciousness. The book, titled What Is Left of \nthe Mind, would explore the changes in the concept of mind during the last 300 years, \nwhich have culminated in a current view of the mind that is hospitable to the idea \nthat machines are not that different from humans. Her book would critique this view \non  both  philosophical  and  moral  grounds.  Prof.  Balog  would  make  substantial \ncontributions to ongoing philosophical debates while also being accessible to a general \naudience on a timely, important topic. \n16.  Prof. Balog’s project was funded at $60,000 for the 12-month period from \nJanuary 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. She received a portion of this grant \naward,  but  NEH  terminated  her  grant  on  or  around  April  2,  2025.  The  grant \ntermination has disrupted Ms. Balog’s life both financially and emotionally. As a \ncondition of her grant, she was required to take a leave of absence from her teaching \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 10 of 60\n \njob, and she is now unsure whether she can continue to work on her book project and \nwill have the financial means to do so, or whether she must return to full-time \nteaching without completing her book project.  \n17.  Plaintiff Benjamin Holtzman is an Assistant Professor of History at \nLehman College. He studies the intersection of political and social history in the \nUnited States, with particular focus on politics, capitalism, race and class, cities, and \nsocial movements. His first book, The Long Crisis: New York City and the Path to \nNeoliberalism, uses the sweeping transformation of post-1960s New York City to \ntrace how market-oriented policies have come to proliferate across American life for \nthe  past  50  years.  His  research  has  also  appeared  in Modern  American \nHistory, the Journal of Social History, the Journal of Urban History, and several \nedited collections.  \n18.  Prof. Holtzman was awarded a $60,000 grant under NEH’s Awards for \nFaculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions program. The grant, which had a period of \nperformance from September 1, 2024, to August 31, 2025, was funding his book \nproject, Fighting the White Power Movement in the Late Twentieth Century, which \nexamines the activist network that took root in cities such as Atlanta, Durham, and \nLouisville to combat the national resurgence of white supremacist organizing in the \nlate 1970s and 1980s. Prof. Holtzman received $50,000 of the award and was due to \nreceive the final $10,000 on July 1, 2025—but on April 3, 2025, he received the \nTermination Notice. Prof. Holtzman’s grant was intended to cover the bulk of his \nliving expenses for the remaining months of the grant period, and as a condition of \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 11 of 60\n \nhis grant, he was prohibited from teaching or engaging in “other major activities,” \nleaving him without other income sources. Not receiving the grant means that he will \nincur a substantial financial burden and has left him scrambling to find a means to \nadequately cover his living expenses. The grant would have also helped to cover \nresearch  expenses  related  to  the  project,  including  transcription  expenses  for \ninterviews and archival research trips to Atlanta, Georgia and Kansas City, Missouri, \nwhich he anticipated taking this summer and which were necessary to moving his \nproject forward, but may now no longer be possible. \n19.  Plaintiff Bill Goldstein is the founding editor of the books website of The \nNew York Times online; reviews books and interviews authors for NBC’s “Weekend \nToday in New York”; and is the curator of public programs at Roosevelt House, the \npublic policy institute of New York’s Hunter College. He is the author of The World \nBroke in Two: Virginia Woolf, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence, E.M. Forster, and the Year \nthat Changed Literature, which has been reviewed by National Public Radio (NPR), \nthe New York Times, the Jewish Book Council, the Guardian, and other publications. \nA graduate of the University of Chicago, Dr. Goldstein received a PhD in English \nfrom the City University of New York Graduate Center and has been awarded \nnumerous  grants  supporting  his  scholarship  over  the  years.  He  resides  in  this \nDistrict. \n20.  On August 13, 2024, NEH awarded Dr. Goldstein a Public Scholars \nprogram grant in support of his latest book project: a biography of Larry Kramer, who \nwas among the first in the country to grasp the gravity of the impending AIDS crisis \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 12 of 60\n \nin the 1980s and begin organizing against it. Dr. Goldstein’s Public Scholars award \nwas for $60,000 and was scheduled to run from September 1, 2024 to August 31, 2025. \nHe received $50,000 of the awarded funds and was scheduled to receive the final \n$10,000  in  July  2025.  However,  on  April  3,  2025,  Dr.  Goldstein  received  the \nTermination Notice, even though he was midway through the grant period. As a \nresult, Dr. Goldstein was deprived of the critical financial and institutional support \nthat he relied on to finalize his highly anticipated project. Because Dr. Goldstein is \nan independent scholar without university affiliation, termination of his grant will \nrequire him to find alternative work and a new income source sooner than planned \nand will divert him from his funded project.  \n21.  Plaintiff Lee Jasperse is a Teaching Fellow in the Department of English \nLanguage and Literature at the University of Chicago. In addition to teaching, Dr. \nJasperse is working on two book projects, both exploring how literature responds to \nlives and bodies that don’t follow typical ideas of desire or feeling – one focusing on \nearly depictions of asexuality, the other on how writers have made art out of the \nnumbing experiences of illness. On February 19, 2025, Dr. Jasperse was accepted to \na fellowship at the Massachusetts Historical Society (“the MHS”) to support the \npursuit of his projects. As part of the fellowship, Dr. Jasperse was awarded a six-\nmonth grant of $30,000 from the MHS that was entirely supported by a grant from \nNEH under the Fellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions program. \nIn MHS’s acceptance letter to Dr. Jasperse, it noted: “[p]lease be aware that your \nfellowship offer is entirely contingent on funding availability from the NEH.” \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 13 of 60\n \n22.  On Tuesday, April 8, 2025, Dr. Jasperse received an email from the MHS \ninforming him that NEH had “terminated its funding for the MHS’s Long-Term \nFellowship Program effective April 2, 2025.” On information and belief, MHS had \nreceived the same or substantially the same Termination Notice that individual \ngrantees received. As a direct result, the MHS rescinded the fellowship, including the \n$30,000 grant. The rescission of Dr. Jasperse’s fellowship and grant is particularly \ndifficult because a key condition of the fellowship, as noted by the MHS in its \nacceptance letter, is that “the NEH prohibits teaching or other major assignments \nduring  the  term  of your  fellowship.”  In  compliance  with  NEH  prohibitions,  Dr. \nJasperse  forewent  taking  on  any  other  major  assignments,  leaving  him  almost \nentirely dependent on the NEH award for income. \n23.  Plaintiff Nicole Jenkins is an Assistant Professor in the Department of \nSociology and Criminology at Howard University in Washington, D.C., and a Visiting \nFaculty  Fellow  at  Harvard  University.  On  February  11,  2025,  Defendant  NEH \nawarded Prof. Jenkins a $60,000 grant under the Awards for Faculty at Historically \nBlack Colleges and Universities Program to complete her book examining Black \nwomen’s navigation of beauty norms, family, and U.S. institutions through a Black \nfeminist lens. The grant period was set to begin on August 1, 2025, and last through \nJuly 31, 2026, and Prof. Jenkins was approved for leave from Howard University for \nthat period to focus on her research. Prof. Jenkins has not received any payments \nunder the grant award to date. \n24.  In April 2025, NEH terminated her grant. The termination of the grant \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 14 of 60\n \nhas cost Prof. Jenkins more than just its dollar value. After she was notified of her \naward, Prof. Jenkins forwent other fellowship, funding, research, and professional \ndevelopment  opportunities  that  were  no  longer  available  when  her  grant  was \nterminated.  And  the  loss  of  the  prestigious  award  and  unavailability  of  other \nopportunities for the 2025-2026 academic year has put at risk Prof. Jenkins’s tenure \npreparation  at  Howard  University,  as  the  book  she  was  to  complete  with  the \ngrant’s support was a core part of her tenure file. \n25.  Defendant National Endowment for the Humanities (“NEH”) is a federal \nagency headquartered in Washington, DC, responsible for administering the NEH \nGrants at issue in this litigation. \n26.  Defendant Michael McDonald is the Acting Administrator of NEH at the \ntime the Termination Notices were issued to NEH Grantees. \n27.  Defendant United States DOGE Service (“DOGE”) is an organization \nwithin the Executive Office of the President. \n28.  Defendant  Amy  Gleason  is  the  Acting  Administrator  of  the  United \nStates  DOGE  Service  and  is  its  highest  ranking  official.  Before  becoming  a \ngovernment official, Ms. Gleason was a healthcare technology executive. \n29.  Defendant Nate Cavanaugh is a member of DOGE and an employee of \nthe General Services Administration. Cavanaugh has reportedly operated on behalf \nof DOGE at multiple agencies, including NEH. Cavanaugh is 28 years old and \npreviously worked in legal technology and financial services, \n30.  Defendant Justin Fox is a member of DOGE and an employee of the \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 15 of 60\n \nGeneral Services Administration. Fox has reportedly operated on behalf of DOGE at \nmultiple agencies, including NEH. \nIV.  FACTUAL BACKGROUND \nA.  Background on NEH  \n31.  The National Endowment for the Humanities is an independent federal \nagency that supports the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction. \n32.  NEH serves and strengthens our Nation by supporting high-quality \nprojects and programs in the humanities and by making the humanities available to \nall Americans. As Congress put it when creating NEH in 1961, “the humanities \nbelong to all the people of the United States,” 20 U.S.C. § 951(1), and NEH’s mission \nis to promote that national asset.  \n33.  In enacting NEH’s founding legislation, Congress recognized that “[a]n \nadvanced civilization must not limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but \nmust give full value and support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural \nactivity in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the \npresent, and a better view of the future.” \n34.  Congress further declared that “Democracy demands wisdom and vision \nin its citizens. It must therefore foster and support a form of education, and access to \nthe  arts  and  the  humanities,  designed  to  make  people  of  all  backgrounds  and \nwherever located masters of their technology and not its unthinking servants.” \n35.  Congress further declared that “it is necessary and appropriate for the \nFederal Government to help create and sustain not only a climate encouraging \nfreedom  of  thought,  imagination,  and  inquiry  but  also  the  material  conditions \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 16 of 60\n \nfacilitating the release of this creative talent.” \n36.  Congress further declared that “[i]t is vital to democracy to honor and \npreserve  its  multicultural  artistic  heritage  as  well  as  support  new  ideas,  and \ntherefore  it  is  essential  to  provide  financial  assistance  to  its  artists  and  the \norganizations that support their work.” \n37.  To advance these ideals, Congress established NEH and authorized it to \nprovide funding for organizations and individuals involved in research, publication of \nscholarly works, and promotion of the humanities. See 20 U.S.C. § 956. Specifically, \nCongress provided that NEH may “enter into arrangements,” including “contracts, \ngrants, loans, and other forms of assistance,” to: \na.  develop and encourage the pursuit of a national policy for the promotion \nof progress and scholarship in the humanities; \nb.  initiate and support research and programs to strengthen the research \nand teaching potential of the United States in the humanities by making \narrangements with individuals or groups to support such activities; \nc.  initiate  and  support  training  and  workshops  in  the  humanities  by \nmaking arrangements with institutions or individuals; \nd.  initiate and support programs and research which have substantial \nscholarly  and  cultural  significance  and  that  reach,  or  reflect  the \ndiversity and richness of our American cultural heritage, including the \nculture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community; \ne.  foster international programs and exchanges; \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 17 of 60\n \nf.  foster the interchange of information in the humanities; \ng.  foster,  with  groups,  education  in,  and  public  understanding  and \nappreciation of the humanities; \nh.  support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities; \ni.  ensure that the benefit of its programs will also be available to our \ncitizens where such programs would otherwise be unavailable due to \ngeographic or economic reasons; and \nj.  foster  programs  and  projects  that  provide  access  to,  and  preserve \nmaterials important to research, education, and public understanding \nof, the humanities. \nB.  NEH Grant Programs \n38.  Prior to the actions at issue here, NEH offered 47 grant programs to \nsupport  museums,  historic  sites,  colleges,  universities,  K-12  teachers,  libraries, \npublic  television and  radio  stations,  research institutions,  independent  scholars, \nauthors, writers, filmmakers, and nonprofits nationwide. Some of these programs are \ndescribed in more detail below. \n39.  Over its history, NEH has awarded over $6 billion to support museums, \nhistoric sites, universities, teachers, libraries, documentary filmmakers, public TV \nand  radio  stations,  research  institutions,  scholars,  and  local  humanities \nprogramming.  \n40.  NEH grants supported the building blocks of American civil society, \nhelping to examine the human condition, promote civics education, understand our \ncultural heritage, foster mutual respect for diverse beliefs and cultures, develop \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 18 of 60\n \nmedia  and  information  literacy,  create  documentaries  and  podcasts,  facilitate \ngroundbreaking research, and preserve and expand access to cultural and historical \nartifacts. \n41.  NEH grants have supported dozens of authors who have won major \nprizes and profoundly influenced the way we understand history, politics, literature \nand society. NEH grants have supported research for numerous books that have been \nhonored with either the Pulitzer Prize or the Bancroft Prize—two of the nation’s most \nprestigious book awards—including: Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin’s American \nPrometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer, which inspired the \n2023  Academy-Award  winning  film  Oppenheimer;  Ari  Kelman’s  A  Misplaced \nMassacre:  Struggling  over  the  Memory  of  Sand  Creek;  Louis  Menand’s  The \nMetaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America; Stacy Schiff’s Vera (Mrs. Vladimir \nNabokov); James M. McPherson’s Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era; William \nTaubman’s Khrushchev: The Man and His Era; Joan D. Hedrick’s Harriet Beecher \nStowe: A Life; and Gordon Wood’s The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787. \n42.  NEH grants don’t only benefit the individuals and institutions that \nreceive them; they also benefit the public at large by increasing access to scholarly \nand popular works that would not otherwise be created. For example, when Ken \nBurns conceived of his now-acclaimed documentary series The Civil War in the 1980s, \nNEH awarded him a grant of $1,349,100, which represented between 30 and 35 \npercent of the project’s budget. “What the Iliad was for the Greeks,” said Lynne \nCheney, chairman of NEH in 1990, when the film first aired on PBS, “the Civil War \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 19 of 60\n \nis for Americans.” On the night it first aired, just shy of fourteen million viewers sat \ndown to watch it. NEH reported a spike in visits to Civil War battlefields following \nthe series’ release. In the intervening 35 years, thousands of classrooms have aired \nthis American classic to schoolchildren, and millions more Americans have learned \nthis vital piece of our country’s history from Ken Burns’ NEH-funded work. As NEH \nputs it, its beneficiaries “have shaped what we know about ourselves and our world.”  \n43.  In addition to individual authors, filmmakers, and institutions, NEH \nalso provided (before April 2025) funding to humanities councils in every U.S. State \nand  Territory.  State  and  jurisdictional  humanities  councils  tailored  their \ngrantmaking and programs to the needs, resources, and interests of their state or \njurisdiction, while also extending the reach of NEH-funded projects and further \nstrengthening the agency’s connection to local communities. These state humanities \ncouncils are not part of the Proposed Classes in this case. \n44.  The  grant  money  NEH  disburses  is  highly  sought  after  through  a \ncompetitive process and tightly controlled by factors Congress has dictated. NEH \ntypically received around 5,700 applications each year across more than 40 grant \nprograms,  and  it  typically  awarded  grants  to  only  16%  of  applicants.  NEH \naffirmatively  works—through  its  own  employees,  the  National  Council  on  the \nHumanities, and  outside peer-reviewers—to  support  a  wide  variety  of academic \ndisciplines and viewpoints within those disciplines. \n45.  Given the highly competitive process for obtaining an NEH grant, the \nbenefits of receiving a grant are not only financial: the grants are a career-defining \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 20 of 60\n \naccolade, and they can make the difference in whether or not a work is widely \ndisseminated,  read,  and/or  viewed.  Winning  and  completing  an  NEH  grant \nsubstantially increases (1) scholars’ chances of receiving tenure at their academic \ninstitutions, (2) authors’ chances of having their funded works published, and (3) \nfilmmakers’ chances of having their work produced and widely circulated. \n46.  Before April 2025, NEH engaged in a rigorous process for selecting \ngrantees among the many thousands of applicants it receives annually. Each year, \nNEH recruits and organizes over 1,000 individual experts into more than 200 peer \nreview panels to review each of the more than 5,500 grant applications NEH receives \nannually. \n47.  Peer  review  panels were  organized  and  overseen  by  NEH  program \nofficers, who themselves were experts in the areas of scholarship for which they were \nasked to review grant applications. \n48.  Program officers placed experts on review panels based on a variety of \nfactors, including broad knowledge of the humanities and specific expertise. \n49.  After a grant application was submitted, a relevant program officer \nreviewed it and, based on academic discipline, institutional type, project area, or \nproject type, assigned it to a specific peer-review panel for the relevant program.  \n50.  Each grant thus received rigorous review by experts in the applicant’s \nfield. And while the NEH Chair ultimately made all final funding decisions, the Chair \ncould  not  do  so  until  the  National  Council  on  the  Humanities—which  reviews \nevaluations of grant applicants from NEH program officers and peer-review panels—\n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 21 of 60\n \nsubmitted  recommendations.  On  information  and  belief,  before  April  2025,  this \nmandatory  consultation  with  the  National  Council  on  the  Humanities  exerted \nsubstantial  influence  over  the  NEH  Chair’s  decision  to  award  a  grant  in  most \ninstances, and ensured that applicants who received grants were meritorious and \nreflected a wide diversity of viewpoints. \n51.  Thus, a grant recipient that went through this process and was awarded \na grant was recognized as an accomplished scholar or author. For example, in a \ntypical grant award letter for individual grantees for 2025 awards, NEH noted that \nin a “highly competitive grant cycle” for Public Scholars applicants, only 9 percent of \napplicants received a grant.  \n52.  Each fiscal year, Congress appropriates funds for NEH to carry out its \nstatutory functions, including to award grants. \n53.  In the 2024 Appropriations Act, Congress appropriated $207,000,000 to \nNEH,  of  which  $192,000,000  “shall  be  available  for  support  of  activities in  the \nhumanities,  pursuant  to  section  7(c)  [20  U.S.C.  §  956(c)]  of  the  Act  and  for \nadministering the functions of the Act.” As such, $192,000,000 was designated for \ngrants, loans, contracts, and other assistance to further the enumerated purposes set \nforth under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). Pub. L. 118-42, 138 Stat. 25, 282 (Mar. 9, 2024) (the \n“2024 Act”). \n54.  On March 15, 2025, Congress enacted a continuing resolution that re-\nappropriated all of the funds appropriated to NEH under the 2024 Act, with the same \nbreakdown on how the money must be spent. Pub. L. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 22 of 60\n \n10-12 (Mar. 15, 2025) (the “2025 Continuing Resolution”). NEH thus received an \nadditional $207 million that it must spend in 2025, including an additional $192 \nmillion that it must spend on grants and other assistance programs under 20 U.S.C. \n§ 956(c). \n55.  The vast majority of these funds were appropriated to be spent on NEH’s \nvarious  grant  programs,  which  included  the  programs  described  immediately \nhereafter. On information and belief, and in light of Defendants’ actions from April 1, \n2025 to the present, NEH no longer plans to support these programs in their intended \nmanner but instead will divert the funds Congress appropriated to it for aims that do \nnot comply with NEH’s organic statute, 20 U.S.C. §§ 951-960, and instead comport \nwith President Trump’s and Defendants’ own preferences.  \n1.  The Public Scholars Program \n56.  One of NEH’s longstanding grant programs was the Public Scholars \nprogram. The Public Scholars program represented a vital investment in American \nintellectual life, providing essential funding that bridged the gap between academic \nresearch  and  public  discourse.  Established  as  part  of  “The  Common  Good:  The \nHumanities in the Public Square” initiative, the program specifically supported well-\nresearched nonfiction books intended to reach broad audiences beyond academia. The \nPublic Scholars program enabled writers to conduct deep research while making \nsignificant humanities topics accessible to general readers, ultimately serving the \ncommon good through the widespread dissemination of important knowledge. \n57.  The Public Scholars program offered grants to individual authors for \nresearch, writing, travel, and other activities leading to the creation and publication \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 23 of 60\n \nof well-researched nonfiction books in the humanities written for the broad public. \nThe program encouraged non-academic writers to deepen their engagement with the \nhumanities by strengthening the research underlying their books, and it encouraged \nacademic writers in the humanities to communicate the significance of their research \nto the broadest possible range of readers.  \n58.  The primary output of a successful Public Scholars award was a well-\nresearched nonfiction book for general readers. \n59.  To apply for a Public Scholars grant, applicants were directed to visit \n“Grants.gov” for application materials. On a page titled “View Grant Opportunity,” \napplicants could access a “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for the Public Scholars \nprogram. The Notice’s Executive Summary stated that the Public Scholars program \n“offers grants to individual authors for research, writing, travel, and other activities \nleading to the creation and publication of well-researched nonfiction books in the \nhumanities written  for  the  broad  public.”  The Notice  stated  that  the  estimated \nnumber of awards each year is “approximately 25 grants.” The Notice further stated \nthat “NEH will provide funding in the form of grants” to successful applicants. The \nNotice  stated  that  awards  would  be  administered  by  the  NEH  Office  of  Grant \nManagement.  The  “Public  Scholars”  page  on  NEH’s  website, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/grants/research/public-scholar-program,  describes  the  Public \nScholars program as a “Grant Program.” \n60.  Public Scholars award recipients were awarded a stipend of $5,000 per \nfull-time month, with a maximum award of $60,000 for a twelve-month period. The \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 24 of 60\n \nminimum award was $30,000, requiring a commitment to six months of full-time \nwork or the equivalent in part-time work. As a condition of receiving an award, \nrecipients with a full-time award were required to forgo all other major activities \n(including teaching), while recipients with a half-time award were required to carry \na reduced teaching load. \n61.  Public Scholar awards were subject to the NEH Public Scholar Program \nTerms and Conditions, which prohibited using awards for promotion of a particular \npolitical, religious, or ideological point of view; advocacy for a particular program of \nsocial or political action; or support of specific public policies or legislation. \n62.  The “Termination” section of the Public Scholar Program Terms and \nConditions stated, in its entirety: “NEH may terminate your Public Scholar award if, \nfor any reason, you choose to discontinue the proposed program before the end of the \nperiod of performance or fail to observe the award’s terms and conditions. If you \ndiscontinue the proposed program before the end of your period of performance, you \nmust return any funds received over and above those to which you are entitled. If \nduring your period of performance you are unable to meet the terms of the award, \nthen you are obliged to inform NEH immediately. Because stipend payments are \nmade in advance, you may be required to return a portion of the stipend to NEH; if \nthis is the case, NEH will inform you of the amount that you must repay, the basis \nfor the calculation, and the date by which you must repay.” Thus, NEH did not \nrepresent to Public Scholar grant recipients that it could rescind Public Scholar \ngrants at will; rather, grants would be rescinded only if a Public Scholar grantee no \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 25 of 60\n \nlonger could or would perform the work the grant was meant to support. \n63.  In March 2025, Defendants modified the funding restrictions for future \ngrants under the Public Scholars program. Specifically, Defendants added language \nto the operative Notice of Funding Opportunity stating that Public Scholar awards \nmay not be used to promote viewpoints disfavored by Defendants, including the \n“promotion of gender ideology,” the “promotion of discriminatory equity ideology,” \n“support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or diversity, equity, inclusion, and \naccessibility (DEIA) initiatives or activities,” or “environmental justice initiatives or \nactivities.” On information and belief, these “new” restrictions reflect Defendants’ \nview that prior Public Scholar grants, including the terminated grants at issue here, \npromoted viewpoints disfavored by Defendants.  \n64.  In April 2025, Defendants announced that Public Scholars grants for \n2026  would  be  awarded  only  to  projects  that  promote  viewpoints  favored  by \nDefendants. Specifically, Defendants announced that grants will be awarded only to \nprojects that “promote” the Nation’s “record of advancing liberty, prosperity, and \nhuman flourishing.” The Notice of Funding Opportunity for the 2026 Public Scholars \nprogram states that applications will be “competitive” only if they “increase public \nknowledge  of  the  250th  anniversary  of  American  Independence  and  American \nexceptionalism.” This change to the Public Scholar grant criteria was offered with no \nexplanation. \n65.  In April or May 2025, Defendants posted a statement on the NEH \nwebsite stating that “NEH has cancelled awards that are at variance with agency \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 26 of 60\n \npriorities, including but not limited to those on diversity, equity, and inclusion (or \nDEI) and environmental justice.” \n2.  The Fellowships Program \n66.  Another of NEH’s grant programs was the Fellowships program. NEH \nFellowships  were  competitive  awards  granted  to  individual  scholars  pursuing \nprojects  that  embody  exceptional  research,  rigorous  analysis,  and  clear  writing. \nEstablished over fifty years ago as the first award offered by NEH, the Fellowships \nprogram facilitated the creation of approximately seven thousand books, many of \nwhich were honored with Pulitzer Prizes, Bancroft Prizes, and other distinguished \nrecognitions.  \n67.  The  Fellowships  program  afforded  scholars  the  uninterrupted  time \nneeded to conduct research or produce books, monographs, peer-reviewed articles, e-\nbooks, digital materials, translations, or critical editions that advance knowledge and \nunderstanding in their fields. The impact of the Fellowships program extended far \nbeyond the individual recipients, with studies confirming that 96 percent of Fellows \nproduce scholarly works that reach both academic and public audiences, and 77 \npercent directly incorporate their NEH-supported research into their teaching.  \n68.  To  apply  for  a  Fellowships  grant,  applicants  were  directed  to  visit \n“Grants.gov” for application materials. On a page titled “View Grant Opportunity,” \napplicants could access a “Notice of Funding Opportunity: Fellowships.” The Notice \nstated that the estimated number of awards each year is “approximately 80 grants.” \nThe Notice further stated that “NEH will provide funding in the form of grants” to \nsuccessful applicants. The Notice stated that awards would be administered by the \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 27 of 60\n \nNEH  Office  of  Grant  Management.  The  “Fellowships”  page  on  NEH’s  website, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/grants/research/fellowships, describes the Fellowships program \nas a “Grant Program.” \n69.  Grant  recipients  under  the  Fellowships  program  were  awarded  a \nstipend of $5,000 per month for full-time work. The minimum award was $30,000 for \na six-month period of performance and the maximum award was $60,000 for a twelve-\nmonth period of performance. \n70.  Fellowship awards were subject to the NEH Fellowships and Awards for \nFaculty  Terms  and  Conditions,  which  prohibited  using  Fellowship  awards  for \npromotion of a particular political, religious, or ideological point of view; advocacy for \na particular program of social or political action; or support of specific public policies \nor legislation. \n71.  The  “Termination”  section  of  the  Fellowship  Program  Terms  and \nConditions stated, in its entirety: “NEH may terminate your fellowship or Award for \nFaculty if, for any reason, you choose to discontinue the proposed program before the \nend of the period of performance or fail to observe the award’s terms and conditions. \nIf you discontinue the proposed program before the end of your period of performance, \nyou must return any funds received over and above those to which you are entitled. \nIf during your period of performance you are unable to meet the terms of the award, \nthen you are obliged to inform NEH immediately. Because stipend payments are \nmade in advance, you may be required to return a portion of the stipend to NEH; if \nthis is the case, NEH will inform you of the amount that you must repay, the basis \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 28 of 60\n \nfor the calculation, and the date by which you must repay.” Thus, NEH did not \nrepresent to Fellowship grant recipients that it could rescind Fellowship grants at \nwill; rather, grants would only be rescinded if a Fellowship grantee no longer could \nor would perform the work the grant was meant to support. \n72.  In March 2025, Defendants modified the funding restrictions for future \ngrants under the Fellowships program. Specifically, Defendants added language to \nthe operative Notice of Funding Opportunity stating that Fellowship awards may not \nbe used to promote viewpoints disfavored by Defendants, including the “promotion of \ngender ideology,” the “promotion of discriminatory equity ideology,” “support for \ndiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility \n(DEIA) initiatives or activities,” or “environmental justice initiatives or activities.” \nOn information and belief, these “new” restrictions reflect Defendants’ view that prior \nFellowships  grants,  including  the  terminated  grants  at  issue  here,  promoted \nviewpoints disfavored by Defendants. \n3.  The Summer Stipends Program \n73.  Another of NEH’s grant programs was the Summer Stipends program. \nThe Summer Stipends program aimed to stimulate new research in the humanities \nand its publication by providing small awards to individuals pursuing advanced \nresearch that is of value to humanities scholars, general audiences, or both. The \nprogram principally supported early-stage research and late-stage writing projects in \nwhich small awards are most effective, including by providing funding to independent \nscholars, community college faculty, and non-teaching staff at universities. \n74.  Summer Stipends supported continuous full-time work on a humanities \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 29 of 60\n \nproject for a period of two consecutive months, at a funding level of $8,000 per stipend. \nNEH funds supported recipients’ compensation, travel, and other costs related to the \nproposed scholarly research. \n75.  To apply for a Summer Stipend grant, applicants were directed to visit \n“Grants.gov” for application materials. On a page titled “View Grant Opportunity,” \napplicants could access a “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for the Summer Stipends \nprogram. The Notice stated that the Summer Stipends program “will provide funding \nin the form of grants.” The Notice stated that the estimated number of awards each \nyear is “up to 100 grants per deadline.” The Notice stated that awards would be \nadministered by the NEH Office of Grant Management. The “Summer Stipends” page \non NEH’s website, https://www.neh.gov/grants/research/summer-stipends, describes \nthe Summer Stipends program as a “grant program.” \n76.  Summer Stipend Awards were subject to the NEH Summer Stipends \nTerms and Conditions, which prohibited using awards for promotion of a particular \npolitical, religious, or ideological point of view; advocacy for a particular program of \nsocial or political action; or support of specific public policies or legislation. \n77.  The “Termination” section of the NEH Summer Stipends Terms and \nConditions stated, in its entirety: “NEH may terminate your Summer Stipend if, for \nany reason, you choose to discontinue the proposed program before the end of the \nperiod of performance or fail to observe the award’s terms and conditions. If you \ndiscontinue the proposed program before the end of your period of performance, you \nmust return any funds received over and above those to which you are entitled. If \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 30 of 60\n \nduring your period of performance you are unable to meet the terms of the award, \nthen you are obliged to inform NEH immediately. Because stipend payments are \nmade in advance, you may be required to return a portion of the stipend to NEH; if \nthis is the case, NEH will inform you of the amount that you must repay, the basis \nfor the calculation, and the date by which you must repay.” Thus, NEH did not \nrepresent to Summer Stipend grant recipients that it could rescind Summer Stipend \ngrants of at will; rather, grants would only be rescinded if a Summer Stipend grantee \nno longer could or would perform the work the grant was meant to support. \n78.  In or around early April 2025, Defendants announced that the Summer \nStipends program “will not be reoffered” in future years. \n4.  Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions and \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities \n79.  Two more of NEH’s grant programs were the Awards for Faculty at \nHispanic-Serving  Institutions  (“HSIs”)  program  and  the  Awards  for  Faculty  at \nHistorically  Black  Colleges  and  Universities  (“HBCUs”)  program.  These  awards \nstrengthened the humanities at HSIs and HBCUs by encouraging and expanding \nhumanities research opportunities for individual faculty and staff members. Awards \nprovided the individual recipient with time to write, conduct research, and pursue \nother project-related activities.  \n80.  Projects  eligible  for  the  Awards  for  Faculty  at  HSIs  and  HBCUs \nprograms included research leading to the development of books, monographs, peer-\nreviewed  articles,  e-books,  digital  projects  and  resources,  translations  with \nannotations or a critical apparatus, critical editions, or other scholarly resources; \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 31 of 60\n \nresearch related to institutional or community goals or interests, such as projects that \ndraw on archival collections, collection and interpretation of oral histories, or the \ndevelopment  of  materials  in  support  of  culture  or  language  preservation  and \nrevitalization;  and  research  leading  to  the  improvement  of  a  single  existing \nundergraduate  course,  including  the  development  of  humanities  resources  (for \nexample, oral histories, identification and preparation of archival sources, or newly \ncompiled historical or literary collections). \n81.  A similar program provided Awards for Faculty at Tribal Colleges and \nUniversities (TCUs). \n82.  Awards under these programs provide a monthly stipend of $5,000 per \nfull-time month, with a maximum award of $60,000 for twelve full-time months. \nGrantees who work full-time on their projects are required to “forgo teaching and \nother  major  activities.”  Grantees  who  receive  a  part-time  award  “must  carry  a \nreduced class load during the period of performance.” \n83.  To apply for Awards for Faculty at HSIs or HBCUs grants, applicants \nwere directed to visit “Grants.gov” for application materials. On a page titled “View \nGrant Opportunity,” applicants could access a “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for \nthe program. The Notice stated that the program “will provide funding in the form of \ngrants.”  The  Notice  stated  that  the  estimated  number  of  awards  each  year  is \n“approximately 22 grants across the three Awards for Faculty programs.” The Notice \nstated that awards would be administered by the NEH Office of Grant Management. \nThe “Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions” page on NEH’s website, \n30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 32 of 60\n \nhttps://www.neh.gov/grants/research/awards-faculty-hispanic-serving-institutions, \ndescribes the program as a “grant program.”  \n84.  Awards for Faculty at HSIs and HBCUs grants were subject to the NEH \nFellowships and Awards for Faculty Terms and Conditions, which prohibited using \nawards for promotion of a particular political, religious, or ideological point of view; \nadvocacy for a particular program of social or political action; or support of specific \npublic policies or legislation. \n85.  The “Termination” section of the  NEH Fellowships and Awards for \nFaculty Terms and Conditions stated, in its entirety: “NEH may terminate your \nfellowship or Award for Faculty if, for any reason, you choose to discontinue the \nproposed program before the end of the period of performance or fail to observe the \naward’s terms and conditions. If you discontinue the proposed program before the end \nof your period of performance, you must return any funds received over and above \nthose to which you are entitled. If during your period of performance you are unable \nto meet the terms of the award, then you are obliged to inform NEH immediately. \nBecause stipend payments are made in advance, you may be required to return a \nportion of the stipend to NEH; if this is the case, NEH will inform you of the amount \nthat you must repay, the basis for the calculation, and the date by which you must \nrepay.” Thus, NEH did not represent to NEH Fellowships and Awards for Faculty \nrecipients  that  it  could  rescind  grants  of  at  will;  rather,  grants  would  only  be \nrescinded if the grantee no longer could or would perform the work the grant was \nmeant to support. \n31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 33 of 60\n \n86.  In or around early April 2025, Defendants announced that the Awards \nfor Faculty at HSIs program “is cancelled for FY2026 and not accepting applications.” \n5.  Awards for Fellowship Programs at Independent \nResearch Institutions \n87.  Another of NEH’s grant programs was the  Fellowship Programs at \nIndependent Research Institutions (“FPIRI”). This program supported institutions \nthat provide fellowships for advanced humanities research in the U.S. and abroad, \nfostered communities of intellectual exchange among participating scholars, and \nprovided  access  to  resources  that  might  otherwise  not  be  available  to  the \nparticipating scholars.  \n88.  Direct  grant  recipients  included  independent  libraries,  archives, \nmuseums, and centers for advanced study; American overseas research centers; and \nAmerican organizations  that  facilitate  humanities research in foreign countries. \nIndividual scholars then applied directly to recipient institutions (“sponsors”) for \nfellowships.  Individual  scholars  who  were  awarded  fellowships  by  recipient \ninstitutions are referred to here as “subrecipients” and are sometimes referred to as \n“participants.” \n89.  Sponsor institutions were required to comply with various conditions in \nawarding fellowships, including that they consider all eligible applicants equally and \ndid not restrict eligibility to members of a scholarly organization; to not accept \napplications from any of their own officers, employees, members of the board of \ntrustees or  advisers, or  selection committee  members; that  they  not  require  an \nadministrative or application fee for NEH-funded fellowships; that they clearly and \n32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 34 of 60\n \neffectively publicize the availability and application procedures; and that they ensure \nthe fair and informed selection of fellows by relying on the recommendations of an \nexternal  committee  composed  of  qualified  scholars  drawn  from  outside  the \ninstitution’s staff and governing bodies. \n90.  Sponsor  institutions  were  also  required  to  comply  with  various \nconditions in administering fellowships, including that they grant the same benefits, \nservices, and accommodations provided to other fellows to NEH-funded fellows, and \nthat they ensure that fellowship tenures are full-time, continuous, and are between \nfour and twelve months long. \n91.  FPIRI awards supported fellowship stipends at a rate of $5,000 per \nmonth. \n92.  To  apply  for  an  FPIRI  award,  applicants  were  directed  to  visit \n“Grants.gov” for application materials. On a page titled “View Grant Opportunity,” \napplicants could access a “Notice of Funding Opportunity” for the program. The \nNotice stated that the program “will provide funding in the form of grants.” The \nNotice stated that the estimated number of awards each year is “approximately 10 \ngrants per deadline.” The Notice stated that awards would be administered by the \nNEH  Office  of  Grant  Management.  The  “Fellowship  Programs  at  Independent \nResearch  Institutions”  page  on  the  NEH’s  website, \nhttps://www.neh.gov/grants/research/fellowship-programs-independent-research-\ninstitutions, describes the program as a “grant program.” \n93.  FPIRI awards were subject to the General Terms and Conditions for \n33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 35 of 60\n \nAwards  to  Organizations,  which  prohibited  using  awards  for  promotion  of  a \nparticular political, religious, or ideological point of view; advocacy for a particular \nprogram of social or political action; or support of specific public policies or legislation. \n94.  The “Termination” section of the  NEH Fellowships and Awards for \nFaculty Terms and Conditions stated: “NEH may suspend or terminate an award in \nwhole or in part if: a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions \nof an award; an award no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities; a \nrecipient violates NEH’s Research Misconduct Policy; a recipient or subrecipient is in \nviolation of the requirement in paragraph (g) of Section 106 of the Trafficking Victims \nProtection Act of 2000 (TVPA) as amended (22 U.S.C. § 7104(g))[; or] NEH has other \nreasonable cause.”  \n95.  In  or  around  early  April  2025,  Defendants  announced  that  “The \nFellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions funding opportunity is \ncancelled for FY26 and is not accepting applications.” \nC.  DOGE AND NEH’s MASS TERMINATION OF NEH GRANTS \n96.  On March 13, 2025, NEH Chair Shelly Lowe was directed by the White \nHouse to resign from her position. Shortly thereafter, teams from DOGE began \nappearing at NEH offices and meeting with NEH leadership to discuss DOGE’s plans \nfor NEH’s future. \n97.  DOGE teams have been deployed to multiple small agencies, in most \ncases  to  swiftly  carry  out  mass  terminations  of staff,  programs,  and  grants.  In \naddition to NEH, DOGE teams have been deployed to the National Labor Relations \nBoard, the Inter American Foundation, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the \n34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 36 of 60\n \nU.S. Institute for Peace, the African Development Foundation, and the National \nEndowment for the Arts. \n98.  On April 1, 2025, NEH staff members were reportedly informed that \nDOGE sought reductions in NEH staff by 70-80% and what could amount to a \ncancellation of all grants made under the Biden administration that have not been \nfully paid out. Acting Chair Michael McDonald reportedly told senior staff that DOGE \n“wants to claw back $175 million’ in grant money that has not yet been disbursed.” \n99.  While  at  NEH,  DOGE  teams—and  specifically  Defendants  Nate \nCavanaugh and Justin Fox—accessed lists of open NEH grants and stated that \ncancelling at least $175 million in grant money was an imperative. \n100.  Approximately one day after receiving the list of open NEH grants, \nDefendants began implementing the Mass Termination. Defendants Cavanaugh and \nFox emailed at least 1,400 grantees, sending them the Termination Notice and \ninforming them that their grants were being terminated, including nearly all grants \nissued during the Biden Administration. The Mass Termination and accompanying \nTermination Notices were not processed through NEH’s grants management system \nas required by internal agency policies. Nearly identical versions of the Termination \nNotice were sent on April 1, April 2, and April 3, to individual and organizational \ngrantees.  \n101.  DOGE and NEH did not conduct an individualized review of grantees. \nInstead, they summarily terminated awards en masse, in the form of a near identical \nTermination Notice sent to all recipients.  \n35 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 37 of 60\n \n102.  The emails sent to NEH grantees did not come from an NEH server or \nemail  address,  but  from  Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com,  a  non-\ngovernmental email account. \n103.  Each of the more than 1,400 Termination Notices sent was purportedly \nsigned by Defendant Acting Director of NEH Michael McDonald. The Termination \nNotices were not hand-signed by McDonald or digitally signed with a verifiable digital \nsignature. Instead, the signature on the termination letters was simply typed by \nsomeone as “/s/ Michael McDonald.” On information and belief, the Termination \nNotices sent to all NEH grantees as part of the Mass Termination were nearly \nidentical and lacked individualized analysis or discussion of each terminated grant. \n104.  On  information  and  belief,  the  Termination  Notices  received  by \nPlaintiffs,  their  members,  and  all  members  of  the  Proposed  Classes  or  their \nsponsoring  organizations  as  part  of  the  Mass  Termination,  stated:  “This  letter \nprovides  notice  that  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Humanities  (NEH)  is \nterminating your federal grant.” \n105.  On  information  and  belief,  the  Termination  Notice  received  by \nPlaintiffs,  their  members,  and  all  members  of  the  Proposed  Classes  or  their \nsponsoring organizations as part of the Mass Termination, provided the following \nexplanation for the terminations: \nYour grant no longer effectuates the agency’s needs and priorities and \nconditions of the Grant Agreement and is subject to termination due to \nseveral reasonable causes, as outlined in 2CFR§200.340. For instance, \nNEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant in light of the fact \nthat the NEH is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in \nfurtherance of the President’s agenda. The President’s February 19, 2025 \n36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 38 of 60\n \nexecutive order mandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily \nrequired activities and functions. See Commencing the Reduction of the \nFederal Bureaucracy, E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025). Your grant’s immediate \ntermination  is  necessary  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  the  federal \ngovernment, including its fiscal priorities…. The termination of your \ngrant represents an urgent priority for the administration, and due to \nexceptional  circumstances,  adherence  to  the  traditional  notification \nprocess is not possible.  \n \n106.  The Termination Notice concluded by telling the recipients, “Please \nremember that your obligations under the Grant Application continue to apply. \nAdditionally, an audit may be conducted by the NEH after the termination of your \ngrant.” Defendants offered no explanation as to why they were obligated to uphold \ntheir obligations pursuant to the grants and Defendants were not.   \n107.  The Termination Notices issued as part of the Mass Termination state \nthat Executive Order 14217 “mandates that the NEH eliminate all non-statutorily \nrequired activities and functions.” However, NEH is not one of the agencies named in \nExecutive Order 14217.  \n108.  According to public sources, in a meeting with staff to answer questions \nabout the Mass Termination, McDonald appeared to acknowledge that he did not \ndetermine which grants to terminate nor did he draft the termination letters. First, \nhe stated that he had explained NEH’s traditional termination process but that “as \nthey  said  in  the  notification  letter…they  would  not  be  adhering  to  traditional \nnotification processes” and “they did not feel those should be applied in this instance.” \nFurther, in response to a question about the rationale for grant terminations, he \nreplied that the “rationale was simply because that’s the way DOGE had operated at \nother agencies and they applied the same methodology here.” McDonald also said that \n37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 39 of 60\n \nany statement about the number of grants terminated would be “conjecture” on his \npart, even though he purportedly signed each termination letter. \n109.  In some instances, the Termination Notice also provided: \nAny objections or appeals to this termination will be managed in strict \naccordance with the President’s Executive Orders, including but not \nlimited to: E.O. 14217 (Feb. 19, 2025), Commencing the Reduction of the \nFederal Bureaucracy; E.O. 14151 (Jan. 20, 2025), Ending Radical and \nWasteful Government DEI Programs and Preferencing; E.O. 14168 (Jan. \n20,  2025),  Defending  Women  from  Gender  Ideology  Extremism  and \nRestoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government; and E.O. 14190 \n(Jan. 29, 2025), Ending Radical Indoctrination in K–12 Schooling. \n \n110.  None of the Executive Orders cited in the Termination Notice mention \nor relate to any topic relevant to NEH’s grant-giving function. Nor do any of these \nExecutive Orders contain any discussion of “objections and appeals.” Moreover, each \nof these Executive Orders provides that they will be implemented “consistent with \napplicable law.” \n111.  The  Termination  Notices  issued  as  part  of  the  Mass  Termination \nincluded no reference to any other method for appeal or to seek reconsideration, even \nthough NEH’s General Terms and Conditions state that grantees have the right to \nappeal a termination.  \n112.  For organizational grantees, NEH Office of Grant Management sent on \nApril 29, 2025, a document titled “Guidance for Recipients of Terminated NEH \nAwards.”  Under  the  heading  “Appeals,”  the  document  stated  that  “NEH  is  not \noffering a means of dispute resolution.” \n113.  Several individual grantees who had their grants terminated attempted \nto appeal the termination or sent inquiries to NEH regarding the process for appeals. \n38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 40 of 60\n \nNEH responded to many of these inquiries by stating that “dispute resolution” was \nnot available or that NEH “is unable to offer you a means of dispute resolution.” \n114.  All Individual Plaintiffs had their grants terminated as part of the Mass \nTermination, through the issuance of Termination Notices. Most or all open grants of \nAuthors Guild members were also terminated as part of the Mass Termination, \nthrough the issuance of Termination Notices. \n115.  The Mass Termination was final agency action under the APA. See 5 \nU.S.C. § 704. The Mass Termination: (1) “mark[s] the consummation of the agency’s \ndecisionmaking process,” and (2) is action “by which rights or obligations have been \ndetermined, or from which legal consequences will flow.” Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. \n154,  178  (1997)  (internal  quotation  marks  omitted).  In  particular,  the  Mass \nTermination  marks  the  consummation  of  NEH’s  decision-making  process  with \nrespect to terminated grants because it announces NEH’s decision to immediately \nterminate those grants in their entirety. The Mass Termination is an action by which \nrights or obligations have been determined or from which legal consequences will flow \nbecause it purports to eliminate all government obligations to pay out grant awards \nand all grantees’ rights to receive their grant awards. \nD.  DOGE AND NEH’s DISMANTLING OF NEH \n116.  On April 3, 2025 (the third of three days Defendants sent Termination \nNotices) 145 NEH staff members—making up 80% of NEH’s staff—were reportedly \nplaced on administrative leave. \n117.  On April 9, 2025, NEH staff received a notice alerting them to an \nupcoming  “multi-step  approach  to  restructuring”  that  promised  to  include  a \n39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 41 of 60\n \nReduction In Force (“RIF”). The notice stated: “NEH is undertaking a multi-step \napproach  to  restructuring  its  internal  organization.  This  restructuring  will \nconsolidate  administrative  and  programmatic  offices  to  enhance  efficiency  and \nstreamline functions. As a result, the agency will be forced to reduce the total number \nof positions.” \n118.  The very next day, many NEH staff received RIF notifications that they \nwould be terminated as of June 10, 2025. On information and belief, approximately \n70-80% of NEH staff received a RIF notification. \n119.  As a result of the termination of staff and grants, NEH has effectively \neliminated or nearly eliminated entire divisions and programs, including but not \nlimited to the Office of Digital Humanities, the Office of Federal/State Partnerships, \nthe Office of Data and Evaluation, the Office of Native and Indigenous Affairs, the \nOffice of Outreach, and the Office of Partnerships and Strategic Initiatives. \n120.  As a result of Defendants’ actions, NEH has terminated nearly all of its \ncurrent grants and most of its future programs, despite having nearly $400 million \nin funding for programs over the last two years, including $192,000,000 it received \nfor grant programs in March 2025. \n121.  Days after the Termination Notices were sent to Plaintiffs and the \nProposed Classes as part of the Mass Termination, which terminated tens of millions \nof dollars of NEH grants, NEH issued a Notice of Funding Opportunity to award up \nto $17 million in grants to build a “National Garden of American Heroes.” The notice \nwas unusual, not only because of its size and the lack of any of the rigorous standards \n40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 42 of 60\n \nfor grant-awarding NEH had previously implemented, but also because never before \nhad NEH—rather than the National Endowment for the Arts—funded the creation \nof public visual art.  \n122.  On May 8, 2025, NEH announced that it awarded $9.55 million in grants \nfor 68 humanities projects.  \n123.  On May 16, 2025, NEH announced a new grant program “for museums, \nlibraries, archives, and other cultural organizations to support public programs on \nthe ideas of the American Revolution and the founding of the United States.” The \nprogram is called Public Impact Projects Celebrating America’s 250th Anniversary. \nThe announcement states that applications are due on July 9, 2025. According to \ngrants.gov,  the  total  program  funding  is  $4  million.  The  Notice  of  Funding \nOpportunity states that projects must start between March 1, 2026, and May 1, 2026. \nE.  DEFENDANTS’ CONDUCT HAS HARMED PLAINTIFFS, \nTHEIR MEMBERS, AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC \n124.  NEH grantees derive many financial and non-financial benefits from \ntheir NEH awards. \n125.  First, NEH awards confer substantial prestige on grantees, marking a \nmajor  professional  accomplishment  and  providing  a  credential  that  can  lead  to \nnumerous rewarding, lucrative, and/or prestigious opportunities. \n126.  Second, NEH awards accelerate grantees’ completion of the projects for \nwhich grant funds are awarded. Awards allow grantees to dedicate themselves full-\ntime to the funded projects, allowing grantees to complete the projects on a far shorter \ntimeline than if they had to maintain their teaching or other jobs while also working \n41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 43 of 60\n \non their projects on their own time. In many cases, NEH grants make the difference \nbetween the project’s completion or its abandonment. By accelerating the timeline for \nproject completion, NEH grants offer to recipients like Plaintiffs myriad benefits that \nresult from project completion, including prestige, publicity, merit-based pay raises, \nadvances and royalties from book deals, honoraria for speaking engagements about \nthe project, among other benefits. \n127.  Third, book projects or other projects attached to an NEH grant are more \nlikely  to  attract  interest  from  prospective  publishers  or  producers  because  the \naward—which as detailed above resulted from a rigorous, competitive application \nprocess surveyed by a wide array of experts—sends a strong signal about the project’s \nmerit and appeal.  \n128.  Fourth,  NEH  grants  can help  recipients  garner  additional  research \ngrants by signaling to other funding bodies that the scholar produces work that, \nunder rigorous vetting, is deemed worthy of financial and governmental support.  \n129.  Fifth, NEH awards help scholars on the job market and can facilitate \ncareer mobility in multiple ways. NEH grants serve as markers of status that (1) \nappeal  to  academic  employers;  (2)  are  strong  indicators  that  the  recipients  are \ncapable of winning additional awards; (3) facilitate the timely completion of a book, \nwhich matters because published books are the principal means by which scholars \nattract attention from prospective universities; and, (4) if the book receives favorable \nreviews, improve the author’s job prospects even more. \n130.  Defendants’ conduct in unlawfully terminating the grants of Plaintiffs, \n42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 44 of 60\n \nPlaintiffs’ members, and class members has destroyed, delayed, or diminished these \nbenefits. Moreover, many NEH grantees turned down or did not pursue alternative \nopportunities  for  funding  and  scholarship  in  reliance  on  their  NEH  grants. \nTermination of Plaintiffs’ (and the Proposed Classes’) grants not only destroys the \nbenefits  of  the  grants  themselves,  but  also  leaves  Plaintiffs  (and  the  Proposed \nClasses) without alternative funding sources or professional opportunities for the \ngrant period, as the deadlines for those opportunities have now passed.  \n131.  Furthermore, many NEH grants—including Public Scholars awards. \nFaculty awards, and Fellowship awards—require grantees to forgo teaching and \nother forms of employment during the grant period, to ensure full-time focus on the \nfunded project. Accordingly, many grantees sought and obtained leaves of absence or \nsabbaticals from their regular jobs to work on their funded projects. Termination of \ntheir grants leaves such grantees with no source of income during their anticipated \ngrant  period.  Moreover,  many  grantees  whose  grants  were  terminated  midway \nthrough  the  grant  period  have  performed  substantial  work  on  their  projects  in \nreliance on the promised grant funds, and much of that work may go to waste if the \nprojects are unable to be completed or if their planned workflows have to be altered \ndue to lack of funds. \n132.  Finally, the Termination Notices’ conclusion, that “your [the grantee’s] \nobligations under the Grant Agreement continue to apply,” requires grantees to \ncontinue  adhering  to  their  obligations—including,  in  many  instances,  forgoing \nemployment—even  though  the  Mass  Termination  purported  to  absolve  the \n43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 45 of 60\n \ngovernment of any and all corollary obligations. This purported continuing obligation \nhas prevented grant recipients, since the Mass Termination, from resuming their \nacademic work and pursuits to the full extent they would have had they never been \nissued an NEH grant.    \n133.  The general public will also bear many of the harms from Defendants’ \nactions. As detailed above, Congress expressly declared that “the humanities belong \nto all the people of the United States,” that “an advanced civilization must not limit \nits efforts to science and technology alone, but must give full value and support to the \nother great branches of scholarly and cultural activity in order to achieve a better \nunderstanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better view of the \nfuture,” and that “it is necessary and appropriate for the Federal Government to help \ncreate and sustain not only a climate encouraging freedom of thought, imagination, \nand inquiry but also the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative \ntalent.” 20 U.S.C. § 951.  \n134.  The  Mass  Termination  will  deprive  the  general  public  of  critical \nscholarly work in the humanities that would have enhanced public understanding of \nthe  past,  present,  and  future,  and  would  have  made  us  all  better  Americans. \nPlaintiffs’  and  class  members’  funded  projects  were  the  best  of  the  best  in the \nhumanities—projects that were funded because highly competitive, expert-led review \nprocesses found that they were intellectually significant, of high quality, and worthy \nof the honor and prestige of an NEH grant. As NEH itself has put it, the projects that \nreceive NEH awards are “the nation’s most significant humanities projects” and make \n44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 46 of 60\n \n“distinguished contributions to the humanities.” Defendants’ actions deprive the \ngeneral public of the immense benefit of these humanities projects.  \nV.  CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS \n135.  Plaintiffs bring this action as a class action pursuant to Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 23(b)(2) on behalf of the following two Proposed Classes: \nIndividual Grantee Class \nAll individual NEH grant recipients whose grants were terminated as \npart of the Mass Termination. \n \nSubrecipient Class \nAll NEH grant subrecipients whose sponsors’ grants were terminated \nas part of the Mass Termination. \n \n136.  For purposes of the class definitions, “Mass Termination” refers to the \nactions described in Part IV.C of this Complaint, which were implemented through \nTermination Notices issued on April 1st through April 5th, 2025. \n137.  NEH defines a “sponsor” as an organization that applies for a grant on \nbehalf of an individual or organization that may not be eligible to apply directly to \nNEH for a grant. Such a sponsor organization may also be called a pass-through or \numbrella organization. The “sponsored” individual or organization, who carries out \nthe work of the project under the oversight of the sponsoring organization, is, for \npurposes of the class definitions, the “subrecipient.” \n138.  The members of the putative classes are so numerous that joinder of all \npotential class members is impracticable. Plaintiffs do not know the exact size of the \nclasses but are informed and believe that the Proposed Classes include hundreds of \nindividuals. \n139.  Plaintiffs’ claims are typical of the claims of other members of the \n45 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 47 of 60\n \nProposed Classes. Specifically, the claims of Plaintiffs Kadetsky, Goldstein, Balog, \nOrlando, Jenkins, and Holtzman are typical of the claims of other members of the \nIndividual Grantee Class, and the claims of Plaintiff Jasperse are typical of the claims \nof other members of the Subrecipient Class. Plaintiffs’ claims and the claims of all \nclass members arise out of the same conduct as alleged herein, and all members of \nthe classes have been similarly affected by Defendants’ wrongful conduct. \n140.  There  are  questions  of  law  and  fact  common  to  both  classes  that \npredominate over any individual issues that might exist. Common questions include, \nbut are not limited to: whether the Mass Termination violated the Administrative \nProcedure  Act;  whether  Defendants  acted  arbitrarily  and  capriciously;  whether \nDefendants  acted  unlawfully;  whether  the  Mass  Termination  violated  the  First \nAmendment;  whether  the  Mass  Termination  violated  the  separation  of  powers; \nwhether  the  Proposed  Classes  should  be  certified;  and  whether  Plaintiffs  and \nmembers of the classes are entitled to injunctive relief. \n141.  Plaintiffs will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class \nmembers. Specifically, Plaintiffs Kadetsky, Goldstein, Balog, Orlando, Jenkins, and \nHoltzman will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the members of the \nIndividual Grantee Class, and Plaintiff Jasperse will fairly and adequately protect \nthe interests of the members of the Subrecipient Class. Plaintiffs have no interests \nantagonistic to those of other members of the classes, and they are committed to the \nvigorous prosecution of this action. In addition, Plaintiffs have retained counsel \ncompetent  and  experienced  in  class-action  litigation,  administrative  law,  and \n46 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 48 of 60\n \nconstitutional law. \n142.  Numerous  identical  lawsuits  alleging  similar  or  identical  causes  of \naction would not serve the interests of judicial economy and would create a risk of \ninconsistent or varying adjudications that would establish incompatible standards of \nconduct for Defendants. \n143.  Defendants have acted on grounds that apply generally to the classes, \nso  that  final  injunctive  relief  or  corresponding  declaratory  relief  is  appropriate \nrespecting the class as a whole. \nVI.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \nCOUNT I \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Arbitrary and Capricious \nFailure to Engage in Reasoned Decisionmaking \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n144.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n145.  A reviewing court must “hold unlawful and set aside agency action” that \nis “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with \nlaw.”  5  U.S.C.  § 706(2)(A).  Government  agencies’  and  officers’  actions  act  in  an \narbitrary and capricious manner if they fail to engage in “reasoned decisionmaking.” \nMichigan v. EPA, 576 U.S. 743, 750 (2015) (citation omitted). Therefore, agency \naction, particularly action which represents a departure from prior agency policy, is \nlawful only if it rests “on a consideration of the relevant factors.” Motor Vehicle Mfrs. \nAss’n of United States, Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983). \n146.  Defendants’ Mass Termination was arbitrary and capricious for many \n47 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 49 of 60\n \nreasons, including (but not limited to) the following. \n147.  First, the Termination Notices issued as part of the Mass Termination \ndo not provide a reasoned explanation. This is evidenced by the fact that every \nPlaintiff and member of the Proposed Classes was sent the same explanation in a \nthree-day period (April 1-3, 2025). Those Termination Notices stated only that the \ngrant “no longer effectuates [NEH’s] needs and priorities and conditions of the Grant \nAgreement and is subject to termination due to several reasonable causes, as is \noutlined in 2CFR§200.340.” That simple statement, and the Termination Notice’s \nfurther blanket statement that “NEH has reasonable cause to terminate your grant \nin light of the fact that is repurposing its funding allocations in a new direction in \nfurtherance of the President’s agenda,” are not reasoned explanations for NEH’s \naction.  \n148.  Second, the Executive Order(s) Defendants cited in the Termination \nNotices as the basis for their decision to issue the Mass Termination do not mention \nNEH, nor do they relate to NEH grants or any valid reason for termination. That is \nnot reasoned decisionmaking.  \n149.  Third, the Mass Termination ignores the reliance interests of grantees. \nFor example, grantees who had already received some but not all of their awards had \nalready  spent  significant  time  working  on  the  projects  funded  by  their  grants. \nSimilarly, many grantees—as their grants required—took leaves of absence from \ntheir jobs, cancelled teaching plans, or otherwise altered their employment status in \nreliance  on  the  promise  of  receiving  grant  money  to  support  them  while  they \n48 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 50 of 60\n \ncompleted their projects.  \n150.  Fourth,  the  Mass  Termination  departs  from  prior  agency  decisions \nwithout  adequate  explanation for  the  change  in the  agency’s position.  All  class \nmembers  received  their  grants  after  NEH’s  rigorous,  objective,  expert-guided \napplication review process concluded that the project warranted funding and satisfied \nall relevant criteria. Defendants failed to provide any reasoned explanation for NEH’s \ndecision to change its position en masse with respect the terminated grants. \n151.  Fifth, the Mass Termination is not the product of agency expertise. See \nState Farm, 463 U.S. at 43 (“An agency rule would be arbitrary and capricious if the \nagency has … offered an explanation for its decision that … is so implausible that it \ncould not be … the product of agency expertise.”). The Mass Termination was ordered \nand implemented by Defendants McDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox, none of \nwhom have expertise in evaluating humanities projects, and none of whom actually \nevaluated the scholarly or artistic merit of any of the projects whose grants were \nterminated. To the contrary, Defendants eschewed the  expert-guided process by \nwhich NEH typically acts, choosing instead to terminate grants en masse without \nexpert guidance. \n152.  Sixth, the Mass Termination “entirely failed to consider . . . important \naspect[s]  of  the  problem.”  State  Farm,  463  U.S.  at  43.  Among  other  things, \nDefendants ignored waste and inefficiency caused by the termination, as well as the \nreliance each grantee undertook, given the investment that taxpayers have already \nmade in many of the projects. The Mass Termination also ignored the significant \n49 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 51 of 60\n \nconsequences the termination will have on the individuals and organizations involved \nin creating the works, the state(s) and congressional district(s) in which the works \nare being produced, and the broader public that would benefit from completion and \nrelease of the funded works.  \n153.  Seventh, Defendants “offered an explanation for [the] decision that runs \ncounter to the evidence before the agency.” State Farm, 463 U.S. at 43. The evidence \nbefore the agency showed that each grantees’ project was worthy of the honor and \nprestige of an NEH grant. No new evidence came before the agency; it simply ignored \nthe evidence and terminated the grants en masse.  \n154.  Eighth, Defendants failed to consider whether, or to explain how, the \nMass Termination would advance NEH’s statutory purposes, 20 U.S.C. §§ 951, 956.  \n155.  Defendants have failed to adequately justify their actions; have not \nconsidered or addressed key aspects of the problem, reasonable alternatives, and the \nsubstantial reliance interests at stake; have relied on factors that Congress did not \nauthorize them to consider; and have not acknowledged or justified their change from \nprior agency positions. \n156.  The Mass Termination and accompanying Termination Notices should \nbe set aside under the APA as arbitrary and capricious.  \nCOUNT II \nViolation of Administrative Procedure Act—Contrary to Law \nIllegal Departure from Impoundment Control Act, NEH Statute, and the \nConstitution \n(Against All Defendants) \n \n157.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n50 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 52 of 60\n \n158.  By delaying spending or outright refusing to spend money that Congress\n appropriated, eliminating or nearly eliminating entire divisions, shutting down \nentire programs, and mass firing staff, Defendants are violating the Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 (ICA), and the appropriations statutes underlying NEH’s funding \nscheme.  Under the ICA, a “deferral” includes any “withholding or delaying the \nobligation or expenditure of” appropriated funds, as well as “any other type of \nExecutive action or inaction which effectively precludes the obligation or expenditure\n of” appropriated funds. 2 U.S.C. § 682(1). When the Executive Branch wishes to defer\n funds, it must send a special message to Congress detailing the money to be deferred\n and the reasons for deferral. There are only three permissible grounds for deferrals,\n  none  of  which  includes  effort  to  ensure  funds  are  spent  consistent  with  the \nPresident’s new policy priorities. Id. § 684(b).  \n159.  Defendants’  actions  constitute  a  “deferral”  because  they  reflect  a \n“withholding or delaying [of] the obligation or expenditure of” funds that Congress \nappropriated for NEH. 2 U.S.C. § 682(1). Defendants did not notify Congress of the \ndeferrals as the ICA requires, nor did Defendants undertake the deferrals for reasons \npermitted by the ICA. \n160.  Defendants’ actions also constitute an unlawful “rescission” of the funds\n appropriated for NEH. Where the President seeks to “rescind” appropriated funds, \nthe ICA requires, among other things, that the President send a special message to \nCongress specifying the funds he seeks to have rescinded and the reasons for his \nproposal. 2 U.S.C. § 683(a). The President did not do so. \n51 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 53 of 60\n \n161.  Defendants also violated NEH’s authorizing statute, 20 U.S.C. §§ 951-\n960, by implementing the Mass Termination, sending the Termination Notices, and \nnotifying Plaintiffs and class members that NEH would be “repurposing its funding \nallocations in a new direction in furtherance of the President’s agenda.” As noted \nabove, in creating NEH and appropriating it money with which to make grants, \nCongress identified 10 missions that NEH grants should further, including “the \npromotion of progress and scholarship in the humanities,” supporting “programs to \nstrengthen  the  research  and  teaching  potential  of  the  United  States  in  the \nhumanities,” and “initiat[ing] and support[ing] programs and research which have \nsubstantial scholarly and cultural significance.” 20 U.S.C. § 956(c)(1)-(10). The work \nPlaintiffs  and  the  Proposed  Classes  were  awarded  grants  to  do  furthers  these \nmissions; the withholding of appropriated funds (or the misappropriation of these \nfunds to the proposed Garden of Heroes project) do not. \n162.  Defendants  also  violated  the  First  Amendment  by  terminating \nPlaintiffs’ and class members’ grants based, at least in part, on Defendants’ belief \nthat the supported works promoted disfavored viewpoints and Plaintiffs’ and class \nmembers’ mere association, through the grant process, with the prior presidential \nadministration.   \nCOUNT III \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions \nViolation of Impoundment Control Act and Appropriations Acts  \n(Against Individual Defendants) \n \n163.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n164.  Plaintiffs  may  bring  a  nonstatutory  claim  to  enjoin  Defendants \n52 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 54 of 60\n \nMcDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox from acting ultra vires in violation of \nstatutory commands. \n165.  Defendants’ delay in spending or outright refusal to spend money that \nCongress appropriated, elimination or near elimination of entire divisions, shutting \ndown of entire programs, and mass firing of staff are without statutory authority and\n violate the Impoundment Control Act, the 2024 Appropriations Act, and subsequent \nContinuing Resolutions. \n166.  Defendants’ termination of grants, including the grants to Plaintiffs and\n  their  members,  is without  statutory  authority  and  violates the  Impoundment \nControl Act, the 2024 Act, and 2025 Continuing Resolutions, because the individual \ngrant terminations were a primary means by which Defendants carried out their \ndeferral of appropriated funds and their outright refusals to spend appropriated \nfunds. \n167.  Because Defendants’ actions violate statutory commands and are ultra \nvires, they should be enjoined and declared unlawful. \nCOUNT IV \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions \nViolation of Separation of Powers \n(Against Individual Defendants) \n \n168.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n169.  This Court has jurisdiction to enjoin Federal officials from violating  the\n Constitution, including the separation of powers. Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. \nOversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 491 n.2 (2010).  \n170.   The Constitution empowers Congress to make laws, U.S. Const. art. I, \n53 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 55 of 60\n \n§ 1, and requires the President to faithfully execute those laws, id. art. II, § 3. \nCongress’s powers to set the policies of the nation are at their apex when it comes to\n spending money, as the Constitution “exclusively grants the power of the purse to \nCongress, not the President.” City & Cnty. of San Francisco, 897 F.3d at 1238. \n171.   The Executive Branch has no constitutional authority to refuse to carry\n out laws enacted by Congress, and it has no constitutional authority to block, amend,\n subvert, or delay spending appropriations based on the President’s own policy \npreferences. \n172.   Defendants’ decisions to unilaterally cancel duly awarded grants and \nwithhold funding Congress has appropriated precisely to fund such grants violates \nthe separation of powers by precluding NEH from carrying out its statutory functions\n and purposes under 20 U.S.C. §§ 951 and 956. \n173.  Defendants’ decisions to delay spending and outright refuse to spend \nthe amounts Congress appropriated violates Congress’s power of the purse and the \nseparation of powers.  \n174.  Defendants’ termination of grants, including the grants of Plaintiffs and \nPlaintiffs’ members, violates the separation of powers, because the mass termination \nof  grants  and  the  individual  terminations  of  the  grants  awarded  to  Plaintiffs, \nPlaintiffs’ members, and the Proposed Class are a primary means by which NEH has \nfailed to carry out its statutory functions and purposes, and by which Defendants \nhave unlawfully deferred spending and outright refused to spend appropriated funds. \n175.  Because Defendants’ actions violate the separation of powers and are \n54 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 56 of 60\n \nultra vires, they should be enjoined and declared unconstitutional. \nCOUNT V \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions \nViolation of First Amendment \n(Against Individual Defendants) \n \n176.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n177.  The First Amendment  provides that  the  Federal  government  “shall \nmake no  law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n178.  The  First  Amendment  prohibits  the  government  from  “regulating \nspeech when the specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the \nspeaker is the rationale for the restriction.” Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of \nUniv. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995). “Discrimination against speech because of its \nmessage is presumed to be unconstitutional.” Id. at 828. \n179.  “[E]ven in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not ‘ai[m] at \nthe suppression of dangerous ideas.’” Nat’l Endowment for the Arts v. Finley, 524 \nU.S. 569, 587 (1998) (quoting Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 \nU.S. 540,  550  (1983)  (alteration  in original)).  In  the grant-making  context,  the \ngovernment may not reject “a whole class of projects” based on “viewpoint alone,” or \nuse Federal funding to “impose a disproportionate burden calculated to drive certain \nideas  or  viewpoints  from  the  marketplace.”  Rhode  Island  Latino  Arts  v.  Nat’l \nEndowment for the Arts, No. 25-cv-79-WES, 2025 WL 1009026, at *12 (D.R.I. Apr. 3, \n2025) (quoting Finley, 524 U.S. at 587). \n180.  Further, the First Amendment includes an implicit “right to associate \nwith others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, \n55 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 57 of 60\n \nreligious, and cultural ends.” Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 622 (1984) \n181.  Defendants’ termination of nearly all NEH grants awarded during the \nprior Administration, and leaving in place existing and future grants that align with \nparticular political and ideological viewpoints, is “the product of invidious viewpoint \ndiscrimination.” Finley, 524 U.S. at 587. Defendants terminated the grants based on \nthe  recipients’  perceived  viewpoint, in an  effort  to  drive  such  views out  of the \nmarketplace of ideas. This is most evident by the citation in the Termination Notices \nto executive orders purporting to combat “Radical Indoctrination” and “Radical … \nDEI Programs,” and to further “Biological Truth.” It is evident from the Termination \nNotice that Defendants believe Plaintiffs’ speech conflicts with the Administration’s \nviews, and their grants were terminated at least in part for this reason. Defendants \nconcluded Plaintiffs’ speech conflicts with the Administration’s views not based on \nany individual analysis of particular grants but based on Plaintiffs’ mere association \nwith  the  prior  administration  through  the  grant  award  process.  Defendants’ \ntermination  of  grants  therefore  burdens  Plaintiffs’  exercise  of  their  expressive \nassociation rights by creating conditions for federal funding that preclude individuals \nand  organizations  associated—no  matter  how  minimally—with  individuals  and \norganizations whose speech Defendants disfavor.    \n182.  The  First  Amendment  does  not  tolerate  Defendants’  viewpoint \ndiscrimination and the burden Defendants’ actions place on Plaintiffs’ exercise of \nFirst Amendment rights. Accordingly, Defendants’ actions are not in accordance with \nlaw and contrary to constitutional right or power. \n56 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 58 of 60\n \nCOUNT VI \nImplied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and Ultra Vires Actions \nActions Without Authority \n(Against Individual Defendants) \n \n183.  Plaintiffs reallege all paragraphs above as if fully set forth herein. \n184.  Under the Constitution, Congress has the authority to set the powers \nand duties of Federal agencies. U.S. const. art. I, § 8, cl. 18. \n185.  Federal  agencies  “possess  only  the  authority  that  Congress  has \nprovided.” Nat’l Fed. of Indep. Bus. v. OSHA , 595 U.S. 109, 117 (2022). “[A]n agency \nliterally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.” La. \nPub. Serv. Comm’n v. FCC , 476 U.S. 355, 374 (1986). \n186.  Congress has not authorized DOGE to conduct the business of another \ncongressionally authorized agency such as NEH. \n187.  According to former or current NEH staff, and a recording of McDonald’s \nstatements to NEH staff on April 3, 2025, Defendants Cavanaugh and Fox of DOGE \ndirectly carried out the termination of NEH grants, including the grants of Plaintiffs \nand their members, by selecting the grants to be terminated, drafting the termination \nletters, and emailing out the termination notice to grantees from a non-NEH email \naddress and server. \n188.  According to former or current NEH staff, Cavanaugh and Fox were also \nthe driving force behind mass staff firings at NEH, which have resulted in the \nelimination or near elimination of entire NEH divisions and programs. \n189.  Because DOGE does not possess any congressionally conferred authority \nto terminate NEH grants or make other institutional decisions of NEH, the actions \n57 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657-CM     Document 75     Filed 05/27/25     Page 59 of 60\n \nof McDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox, are ultra vires and should be enjoined \nand declared unlawful. \nPRAYER FOR RELIEF \n \n  Wherefore, Plaintiffs respectfully request that the Court certify the Proposed \nClasses, enter judgment in favor of Plaintiffs, and award Plaintiffs and the Proposed \nClasses the following relief: \nA. Declare as unlawful and set aside Defendants’ Mass Termination and \naccompanying Termination Notices that terminated the grants \nawarded to Plaintiffs, Plaintiff The Authors Guild’s members, and the \nmembers of the Proposed Classes, as in violation of the Administrative \nProcedure Act, the Impoundment Control Act, the NEH organic statute \nand Appropriations Acts, the separation of powers, and the First \nAmendment; \nB. Declare as ultra vires Defendants’ decision to implement the Mass \nTermination and its transmittal of the Termination Notices to \nPlaintiffs, Plaintiff Authors Guild’s members, and the members of the \nProposed Classes; \nC. Enjoin Defendants from giving effect to the Mass Termination and \naccompanying Termination Notices or any similar future action \neffectively terminating, contrary to statute and the Constitution, duly \nawarded NEH grants; \nD. Certify undersigned counsel as class counsel upon certification of the \nProposed Classes \nE. Award Plaintiffs and counsel for the Proposed Classes reasonable costs \nand attorneys’ fees; \nF.

This  lawsuit  challenges  the  recent  dismantling  of t he N  ational  Endowment f or  the \n Humanities  (“NEH”),  an  agency  created  by  Congress  sixty  years  ago  to  foster  the  learning  and \n advancement of humanities in this nation. \n 2.   In  1965,  Congress  declared  that  “the  humanities  belong  to  all  the  people  of  the \n United  States.”  20  U.S.C.  §  951(1).  “Democracy  demands  wisdom  and  vision  in i ts  citizens,” \n Congress   found,   and   therefore   “national   progress   and   scholarship   in   the   humanities”   are \n “appropriate  matters  of  concern  to  the  Federal  government.”  Id.  §§  951(2),  (4).  Congress  thus \n deemed  it “  n ecessary a nd a ppropriate  for  the F  ederal G  overnment t o c omplement,  assist,  and a dd \n to  programs  for  the  advancement  of  the  humanities  .  .  .  by  local,  State,  regional,  and  private \n agencies  and  their  organizations.”  Id.  §  951(5).  In  Congress’s  view,  “it  is  essential  to  provide \n financial  assistance  to  .  .  .  organizations  that  support”  the  humanities.”  Id.  §  951(10).  Congress \n established NEH “to implement these findings and purposes.”  Id. §   951(12). \n 3.   Over   the   last   six   decades,   with   bipartisan   support   from   Congress   and \n administrations   of   both   political   parties,   NEH   has   grown   to  become  the  largest  and  most \n prestigious  funder  of  advanced  humanities  research  in  the  United  States.  Since  its  founding, \n NEH  has  awarded  over  $6  billion  in  grants  to  museums,  historic  sites,  colleges,  universities, \n K-12   teaching,   libraries,   public   television   and   radio   stations,   research   institutions,   and \n 2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 3 of 46\n independent  scholars.  Scores  of  organizations  and  individuals  rely  on  NEH  to  fund  important \n projects and research that could not be accomplished without NEH’s support. \n 4.   Congress’s  funding  of  NEH  and  its  programs  has  continued  to  this d ay.  In M  arch \n 2025,  Congress  appropriated  an  additional  $207  million  to  NEH  to  fund  its  activities,  the  vast \n majority of which NEH must use on its grant programs. \n 5.   But  NEH’s  60-year  history  of  fostering  the  humanities  came  to  a  crashing  halt \n earlier  this  month,  at  the  hands  of  the  United  States  DOGE  Service  (“DOGE”).  Two  DOGE \n operatives  who  have  been  hopping  from s mall a gency t o s mall a gency t o d ismantle  the a gencies, \n Defendants  Nate  Cavanaugh  and  Justin   Fox,   arrived  at  NEH  to  do  the  same.  According  to \n accounts  of  former  or  current  NEH  staff,  these  operatives  demanded  lists  of  open  NEH  grants \n and  then  indiscriminately  terminated  the  vast  majority  of  the  grants.  According  to  former  or \n current  NEH  staff,  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  did n ot e ven b other h aving N  EH  officials  effectuate  their \n work;   Cavanaugh   and   Fox   themselves   emailed   nearly   1,500   NEH   grantees   from   a \n “ G  rant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com ”    email   address,   notifying   the  grantees  that \n their  awards  had  been t erminated.  NEH’s  Acting C  hairman  Michael  McDonald a ctually  admitted \n to  staff   a  day  after  the  grant  terminations  that  “they”—DOGE—had  written  the  termination \n letters  and  that  he  was  not  even  aware  of  the f ull s cope o f  the t erminations.  According t o f ormer \n or  current  NEH  staff,  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  subsequently  demanded  that  NEH  mass  terminate  its \n staff,   resulting   in   the   abrupt   issuance   of   reduction-in-force   notices   to  roughly  75%   of   its \n workforce. \n 6.   NEH   is   now   left  as   a  shell  of   the  agency  that  Congress  established  and  has \n consistently  funded.  According  to  former  or  current  NEH  staff,  NEH  has  eliminated  or  nearly \n eliminated  entire  agency  programs  and  divisions,  including  several p rograms a nd d ivisions f rom \n 3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 4 of 46\n which  Plaintiffs  and  their  members  have  received  grants a nd a nticipated  applying f or  new  grants \n in  the  near f uture. N  EH  has  publicly  announced t he c ancellation  of  at l east e ighteen  programs f or \n which  it  has  previously  issued  notices o f f unding o pportunities,  and t he o nly s ubstantial  program \n that  NEH   seemingly  will  pursue   going  forward   is   a  “Garden  of   Heroes”  that N  EH  cannot \n lawfully  fund.  For  all o f  the p rogram a nd d ivision e liminations,  and t he m  ass  firing o f s taff, N  EH \n has  provided  little  to  no  explanation,  let  alone  the  type  of  reasoned  explanation  required  under \n bedrock  principles  of  administrative  law.  Further,  NEH  has  provided  no  explanation  of  how,  in \n its   hollowed-out   state,   NEH   intends  to  comply  with  its  statutory  duties  and  spend   all  the \n appropriations that Congress has mandated it spend. \n 7.   The  Trump  Administration’s  dismantling  of  NEH  is  unlawful  many  times  over. \n Most  fundamentally,  the  Constitution  grants  Congress—not  the  President—the  power  to  create \n and  prescribe  the  duties  of  Federal  agencies,  and  Congress  maintains  the e xclusive  power  of  the \n purse  in  directing  how  Federal  funds  must b e s pent. T  he P  resident c annot u nilaterally  shut  down \n an  agency  that  Congress  has  created,  nor  may a n a gency r efuse t o s pend  funds  that C  ongress  has \n appropriated.   Such   unilateral   Executive   action   not   only   violates   the   constitutional \n separation-of-powers,  but  it  also  violates  the  Impoundment  Control  Act  of 1  974  (“ICA”), w  hich \n sets strict limits on the Executive Branch’s ability to delay spending appropriated funds. \n 8.   Defendants’  actions  in  eliminating  programs  and  divisions,  mass  firing  staff,  and \n refusing  to s pend   appropriations  are  also  arbitrary  and  capricious  under  the  Administrative \n Procedure  Act.  The  actions  are  arbitrary  and  capricious  in  every  way  that  agency  action  can  be \n arbitrary  and  capricious:  Defendants  provided  no  reasoned  explanations  for  their  actions,  they \n relied  on  factors  that C  ongress  did n ot p ermit  them t o r ely o n,  they c hanged l ongstanding a gency \n 4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 5 of 46\n positions  without  acknowledging  the  change,  and  they  utterly  failed  to  consider  the  reliance \n interests of thousands of NEH grantees that have long relied on NEH. \n 9.   Worse   yet,  all  of  these  actions  were  taken  or  directed  by  DOGE,  a  body  not \n created  or  authorized  by  statute.  DOGE  has  no  lawful  authority  to  carry o ut t he w  ork  of  another \n agency,  let  alone  to  dismantle  it.  The  Supreme  Court  has  made  clear  that  Federal  agencies  have \n no power to do anything unless given that power by Congress, and DOGE has been given none. \n 10.   Plaintiffs   are   three   of   the   nation’s   preeminent   humanities   associations:   the \n American  Council  of  Learned  Societies,  the  American  Historical  Association,  and  the  Modern \n Language   Association.   Collectively,   they   have   thousands   of   individual   and   organizational \n members  who  rely  on  NEH  to  fund  and  support  their  projects  in  the  humanities.  Plaintiffs  and \n their  members  have  suffered  immense  harm  as  a  result  of  the  Trump  Administration’s  efforts  to \n illegally   dismantle   the   only   Federal   agency   in   the  United  States  dedicated  to  funding  the \n humanities.  If  those  efforts  are  not  enjoined,  hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in  taxpayer-funded \n projects  and  research  will  not  be  completed  and  rendered  useless,  hundreds  of  millions  more  in \n Congressional  appropriations  will  go  unspent,  and  the  fostering  of  the  humanities  that C  ongress \n mandated NEH carry out sixty years ago will disappear. \n 11.   To  prevent  these  extraordinary  harms,  Plaintiffs  bring  this  suit  to  enjoin  and  set \n aside  Defendants’  unlawful  actions,  and  to  require  the  Trump A  dministration  to o perate  NEH  as \n Congress intended, unless and until Congress says otherwise. \n PARTIES \n 12.   Plaintiff   American   Council   of   Learned   Societies   (“ACLS”)   is   a   nonprofit \n organization  whose  members i nclude  81  scholarly  organizations.  ACLS  was  founded  in  1919 \n and   is   headquartered   in   New   York,   NY.   It   is   focused   on   supporting   the   creation   and \n 5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 6 of 46\n dissemination  of  knowledge  that  advances  understanding  of  humanity  and  human  endeavors  in \n an  effort  to  improve  the  human  experience.  ACLS  undertakes  this  mission  through  its  work \n directly   and   through  providing  funding  research  and  related  activities.  Both  ACLS   and  its \n members  receive  awards  directly  from  NEH.  ACLS  has  received  a  total  of  144  direct  NEH \n awards  since  NEH’s f ounding.  As  described  in  more  detail  below,  ACLS  and  its  members  have \n been substantially injured by the recent actions of, or in the name of, NEH. \n 13.   Plaintiff   American  Historical  Associatio n   (“AHA”)  is  a  nonprofit  organization \n founded  in  1884  and  incorporated  by  Congress  in  1889  for  the  promotion  of  historical  studies. \n AHA’s   mission   is   to   enhance   the  work   of   historians,  including  by   promoting  professional \n standards  and  ethics,  innovative  scholarship  and  teaching,  academic  freedom,  and  international \n collaboration.  AHA  is  the  largest  membership  association  of  historians  in  the  world,  with  over \n 10,400  members.

Finding  that  “[t]he  arts  and  the  humanities  belong  to  all  people  of  the  United \n States,”  20   U.S.C.   §   951(1),   Congress   created  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Humanities \n (“NEH”)  and  its s ister a gency,  the N  ational  Endowment f or  the A  rts  (“NEA”), i n 1 965,  as p  art o f \n the  National  Foundation  on  the  Arts  and H  umanities  Act o f 1  965  (“NFAHA”  or “ the A  ct”). P  ub. \n L. 89-209, 79 Stat. 845 (Sept. 29, 1965) (codified at 20 U.S.C. §§ 951-60). \n 25.   In  establishing  NEH,  Congress  found  that  “it  is  necessary  and a ppropriate  for  the \n Federal  Government  to  complement,  assist,  and  add  to  programs  for  the  advancement  of  the \n humanities  and  the  arts  by  local,  State,  regional,  and  private  agencies  and  their  organizations.” \n Id.  §  951(5).  Congress  believed  that  the  Federal  government  has  a  key  role  in  “ h elp[ing]  create \n and  sustain  not o nly a  c limate  encouraging  freedom o f  thought, i magination,  and i nquiry b ut a lso \n the material conditions facilitating the release of this creative talent.”  Id.  § 951(7). \n 8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 9 of 46\n 26.   Accordingly,  Congress  established  NEH  to  provide  funding f or  organizations  and \n individuals   involved   in   research,   publication   of   scholarly   works,   and   promotion   of   the \n humanities.  See 2 0 U.S.C. § 956. \n 27.   Congress  viewed  this  directive  as  a  broad  one,  meant  to  fund  a  wide  range  of \n projects  and  not  to  promote  a  singular  viewpoint,  and  to  fund  traditionally  underrepresented \n recipients.  See 2 0 U.S.C. § 956(c). \n 28.   To   that  end,  in  creating  NEH,  Congress  included  several  provisions  aimed  at \n protecting  the  agency  from  political  influence.  For  example,  Congress  has  prohibited  Federal \n agencies  and  employees  from  “exercis[ing]  any  direction,  supervision, o r  control o ver t he p olicy \n determination, personnel, or curriculum” of any grantee organization. 20 U.S.C. § 953(c). \n 29.   Congress  also  provided  for  a  process  under  which  grant  applications  generally \n must  be  reviewed  by  NEH’s  National  Council  on  the  Humanities  (the  “Council”)  before  being \n approved a nd i ssued  by  the a gency.  Id.  §  957(f). T  he C  ouncil i tself i s  made u p  of  the C  hairperson \n and  26  “private  citizens…who  are  recognized  for  their  broad  knowledge  of,  expertise  in,  or \n commitment  to  the  humanities”  and  who  are  appointed  to  staggered  six-year  terms,  ensuring \n appointment across Presidential administrations.  Id.  § 957(c). \n 30.   The   Chairperson   “shall   not   approve   or   disapprove   any   [financial   support] \n application  until  the  Chairperson  has   received  the  recommendation  of   the  Council  on  such \n application.”  Id.  § 957(f). \n 31.   This  statutory  framework  demonstrates  Congress’s  intent  to  insulate  NEH  from \n political  control.  As  a  Senate  committee  report  explained:  “It  is  the  intent  of  the  committee  that \n in  the  administration  of t his  act  there  be  given  the  fullest  attention  to  freedom  of  artistic  and \n 9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 10 of 46\n humanistic  expression.  .  .  .  [N]o  undue  preference  should  be  given  to  any  particular  style  or \n school of thought or expression.” S. Rep. No. 80-300, at 3-4 (1965). \n 32.   With  this  broad  purpose  in m  ind, C  ongress  provided t hat t he C  hairperson o f N  EH \n may   “enter   into   arrangements,”   including   “contracts,   grants,   loans,   and   other   forms   of \n assistance,” to further a limited set of purposes. 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). 1   These purposes include to: \n ●   develop  and  encourage  the  pursuit  of  a  national  policy  for t he p romotion o f p  rogress  and \n scholarship in the humanities; \n ●   initiate   and   support   research   and   programs   to  strengthen  the  research  and  teaching \n potential  of  the  United  States  in t he h umanities  by  making a rrangements  with i ndividuals \n or g  roups  to support such activities; \n ●   initiate  and  support  training  and  workshops  in  the  humanities  by  making  arrangements \n with institutions or individuals; \n ●   initiate  and  support  programs  and  research  which  have  substantial  scholarly  and  cultural \n significance  and  that  reach,  or  reflect  the  diversity  and  richness o f o  ur  American  cultural \n heritage, including the culture of, a minority, inner city, rural, or tribal community; \n ●   foster international programs and exchanges; \n ●   foster the interchange of information in the humanities; \n ●   foster,   with   groups  ,   education   in,  and  public  understanding  and  appreciation  of   the \n humanities; \n ●   support the publication of scholarly works in the humanities; \n ●   ensure  that  the  benefit  of  its  programs  will  also  be  available  to  our  citizens  where  such \n programs would otherwise be unavailable due to geographic or economic reasons; and \n ●   foster  programs  and  projects  that  provide  access  to,  and  preserve  materials  important  to \n research, education, and public understanding of, the humanities. \n Id. \n 1  In addition, Congress provided for three additional types of grant programs: grants in aid programs in each state; \n assisting public agencies and nonprofit organizations seeking to increase the levels of their support; and small annual \n awards for the Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities Award and the Charles Frankel Prize. 20 U.S.C. § § \n 956(f),(h),(m). \n 10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 11 of 46\n 33.   Through  these  programs,  NEH  has  played  a  significant  role  in  both  expanding \n access  to  the  humanities  and  funding  a  wide  range  of  research,  training,  and  education.  Indeed, \n “[a]s  the  largest  federal  funder  of  the  humanities,  NEH  offers  47  grant  programs  to  support \n museums,  historic  sites,  colleges,  universities,  K-12  teachers,  libraries,  public  television  and \n radio  stations,  research i nstitutions,  independent  scholars,  and  nonprofits  nationwide.”  NEH \n Website, Grants, https://perma.cc/282U-ENAJ. \n 34.   NEH’s   programs   have   included   a   specialized   grant   program   for   community \n colleges  aimed  at  “expand[ing]  the  humanities  resources  and e ducational  opportunities  available \n to  historically  underserved  student  populations.”  Press  Release,  National  Endowment  for  the \n Humanities  Announces  New  Grant  Program  for  Two-Year  Institutions ,   National  Endowment f or \n the Humanities (June 3, 2015),  https://perma.cc/WGS5-GC67 .  \n 35.   NEH  funding  has  supported v ideo s eries s uch a s  a 2 0-hour  series o n  the h istory o f \n baseball;  a  2.5-hour  dramatic  representation  of B  rown  v.  Board  of E  ducation ;  a nd a  d ocumentary \n on the American experience during World War II. \n 36.   And   NEH   funding   has   supported   smaller   projects   including   individualized \n research projects and college coursework. \n 37.   Both h istorically  and o ver t he l ast s everal y ears, P  laintiffs  and t heir m  embers h ave \n received  hundreds  of  NEH  grants  for  a  range  of  work  and  funding  a  wide  range o f r esearch a nd \n actions. \n NEH Maintained a Robust Organizational Structure to Fulfill Its Mission \n 38.   Until l ast m  onth, N  EH  maintained  a r obust  organizational  structure t o c arry o ut i ts \n statutory functions. \n 11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 12 of 46\n 39.   As   of   January   2025,   NEH’s   organization  and  management  were  as   depicted \n below: \n 40.   NEH  thus  had  seven d ivisions u nder t he A  ssistant  Chair f or  Programs  to c arry o ut \n specific  types  of  activities  and  grant  programs,  and  NEH  had  three  offices  under  the  Assistant \n Chair  for  Partnerships  and  Strategic  Initiatives,  each  focused  on  different  types  of  community \n outreach or initiatives. \n 12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 13 of 46\n 41.   As of April 1, 2025, NEH had more than 200 employees across the agency. \n NEH  Awarded  Grants  Through  a  Rigorous,  Staff-Intensive  Advisory  Process  to E  ffectuate  its \n Statutory Goals \n 42.   The process of awarding NEH grants requires significant NEH staff resources. \n 43.   Each  year,  NEH  recruits  and  organizes  over  1,000  individual  experts  into  more \n than  200  peer  review  panels  to  review  each  of  the  more  than  5,500  grant  applications  NEH \n receives annually. \n 44.   Peer   review   panels   are   organized   and  overseen  by   NEH  p rogram  officers— \n themselves experts from each of NEH’s seven program divisions set forth above. \n 45.   Program  officers  place  experts  on  review  panels  based  on  a  variety  of  factors \n including  broad  knowledge  of  the  humanities  and  specific  expertise.  Larger g rant p rograms m  ay \n have several peer-review panels. \n 46.   NEH  does  not  permit  any  expert  to  serve  on  a  review  panel  for  the  same  grant \n program  two  years  in  a  row  and  does  not  maintain  any  standing  panels.  As  a  result,  NEH  staff \n must go through this time-intensive process at the start of each grant competition. \n 47.   The  panels  are f ormal—announced  in t he F  ederal R  egister—and  transparent,  with \n names of panelists added to NEH’s annual reports. \n 48.   After  a  grant  application  is  submitted,  a  relevant  program  officer  reviews  it  and, \n based  on  academic  discipline,  institutional  type,  project  area,  or  project  type,  assigns  it  to  a \n specific peer-review panel for the relevant program. \n 49.   The  panel  of  three t o  six  experts ( called  evaluators  once p laced  on  a p anel) r eview \n each  assigned  application  according  to  NEH’s  published  review  criteria  and  program-specific \n guidelines.  While  specific  criteria  will  differ  based  on  the  program,  this  will  generally  include \n 13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 14 of 46\n consideration  of  significance  to  the  humanities,  the  applicant’s  abilities  and  qualifications,  the \n proposal’s clarity of expression, and the project’s feasibility, design, cost, and work plan. \n 50.   Generally,  each  evaluator  will  grade  each  grant  application  individually  before \n meeting  as  a  group  with  other  evaluators  on  their  panels  to  discuss  each  of  the  applications. \n While  panelists  meet  and  may  try  to  reach c onsensus,  they a re n ot r equired t o d o  so;  rather,  each \n evaluator then provides individual final ratings on each application. \n 51.   As  a  result,  program  officers  do  not  receive  a  uniform  set  of  recommendations \n from  peer  review  panels.  Rather,  program  officers  must  then  organize  panel  results  both  within \n each panel and across multiple review panels for each grant program. \n 52.   NEH  program  officers  will  then r ecommend  applicants  for  each p rogram, s eeking \n to  identify  applications  of  similar  quality  across  each p anel. P  rogram o fficers d raft s ummaries o f \n the  ratings  and  comments  from  panel  evaluators  and  submit  recommendations  to  the  National \n Council on the Humanities. \n 53.   The  National  Council  on  the  Humanities  meets  three  times  each  year,  each  for \n two days, to evaluate recommendations from NEH’s divisions’ program officers. \n 54.   While  the  Chair  of  NEH  ultimately  makes  all  final  funding  decisions,  with  the \n exception  of  certain  lower-dollar  discretionary  Chairs  Grants,  the  Chair  cannot  do  so  until  the \n Council  has  submitted  recommendations.  In  assessing  applications  for  funding,  the  Chair  takes \n into  account  the  Council’s  recommendations,  as  well  as  the  larger  set  of  information  available \n from program staff and evaluators. \n Congress Has Appropriated NEH Hundreds of Millions of Dollars Each Fiscal Year, Most of \n Which Is For Grantmaking \n 55.   Each  fiscal  year,  Congress  appropriates  funds  for  NEH  to  carry  out  its  statutory \n functions, including to award grants. \n 14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 15 of 46\n 56.   In  the  2024  Appropriations  Act,  Congress  appropriated  $207,000,000  to N  EH,  of \n which  $192,000,000  “shall  be  available  for  support  of  activities  in  the  humanities,  pursuant  to \n section  7(c)  [20  U.S.C.  §  956(c)]  of  the  Act  and  for  administering  the  functions  of  the A  ct.” A  s \n such,  $192,000,000  was  designated  for  grants, l oans, c ontracts,  and o ther a ssistance t o f urther t he \n enumerated  purposes  set  forth  under  20  U.S.C.  §  956(c). P  ub.  L. 1 18-42,  138  Stat. 2 5,  282  (Mar. \n 9, 2024) (the “2024 Act”). \n 57.   On  March 1 5,  2025,  Congress  enacted  a c ontinuing  resolution t hat r e-appropriated \n all  of  the  funds  appropriated  to  NEH  under  the  2024  Act,  with  the  same  breakdown  on  how  the \n money  must  be  spent.  Pub.  L.  119-4,  §§  1101-08,  139  Stat.  9,  10-12  (Mar.  15,  2025) ( the “ 2025 \n Continuing  Resolution”).  NEH   thus   received  an  additional  $207  million  that  it  must  spend, \n including  an  additional  $192,000,000  that  it  must  spend o  n  grants a nd o ther a ssistance p rograms \n under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \n DOGE Sweeps Into NEH and Mass Terminates Grants and Staff \n 58.

According  to  accounts  of  former  or  current  NEH  employees,  very  shortly  after \n receiving  the  list  of  open  NEH  grants,  on  April  2,  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  emailed  nearly  1,500 \n grantees  on  the  list  informing  the  grantees  that  their  grants  were  being  terminated,  including \n nearly  all  grants  issued  during  the  Biden  Administration.  According  to  former  or  current  NEH \ne mployees,  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  did  not  process  the  grant  terminations  through  NEH’s  grants \n management system as required by internal agency policies. \n 65.   The  emails  received  by  NEH  grantees  did n ot c ome f rom a n N  EH  server o r  email \n address,  but  from  Grant_Notifications@nehemail.onmicrosoft.com ,   a  non-governmental  email \n account. \n 66.   The   emails   attached   a   grant   termination  letter  purportedly  signed  by   Acting \n Director   of   NEH   Michael   McDonald.   The   termination   letters   were   not   hand-signed   by \n McDonald  or  digitally  signed  with  a  verifiable  digital  signature.  Instead,  the  signature  on  the \n termination letters was simply typed by someone as “/s/  Michael McDonald . ” \n 67.   In  a  meeting  with  staff  to  answer  questions  about  the  terminations,  McDonald \n appeared  to  acknowledge  that h e d id n ot d etermine  which g rants t o t erminate  nor d  id h e d raft t he \n termination  letters.  First,  he  stated  that  he  had  explained  NEH’s  traditional  termination  process \n but   that   “as   they  said  in  the  notification  letter… t hey  would   not  be  adhering  to  traditional \n notification  processes”  and  “ t hey  did  not  feel  those  should  be  applied  in  this  instance.”  Further, \n in  response  to  a  question  about  the  rationale  for  grant t erminations,  he r eplied  that t he “ rationale \n was s imply  because  that's  the  way  DOGE  had  operated  at  other  agencies  and  they  applied  the \n same  methodology  here.” 1 2  McDonald  also  said  that  any  statement  about  the  number  of  grants \n terminated   would   be   “conjecture”   on   his   part,   even   though   he   purportedly   signed   each \n 12  NEH SLT Meeting Recording - 04/03-2025, \n https://www.rev.com/app/transcript/NjgxMTE2MjgzOGFiYWRjZGM5NTIxYjk5ZEpYN0hBcVNYY0xJ/o/VEMw \n NDc3NTI1NjEz (last visited May 1, 2025). \n 17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 18 of 46\n termination.  He  further  told  NEH  he “ did h ave s ome e ffect i n s aving a  n umber o f g  rants t hat h ad \n otherwise been targeted.” \n 68.   On  information  and  belief,  the  termination  letters  to  all  grantees  sent  on  April  2 \n were  nearly  identical  and  lacked  any  individualized  analysis  or  discussion  of  each  terminated \n grant. \n 69.   The  termination  letters  received  by  Plaintiffs  and  others c ontained  the  following \n explanation for the terminations: \n Your  grant  no  longer  effectuates  the  agency’s  needs  and  priorities  and  conditions \n of  the  Grant  Agreement  and  is  subject  to  termination  due  to  several  reasonable \n causes,  as  outlined  in  2CFR§200.340.  NEH  has  reasonable  cause  to  terminate \n your  grant  in  light  of  the  fact  that  the  NEH  is  repurposing  its  funding a llocations \n in   a   new   direction   in  furtherance  of   the  President’s   agenda.  The  President’s \n February   19,   2025   executive   order   mandates   that   the   NEH   eliminate   all \n non-statutorily  required  activities  and  functions.  See  Commencing  the  Reduction \n of  the  Federal  Bureaucracy ,   E.O.  14217  (Feb.  19,  2025).  Your  grant’s  immediate \n termination  is   necessary  to  safeguard  the  interests  of  the  federal  government, \n including  its  fiscal  priorities.  The  termination  of  your  grant  represents  an  urgent \n priority  for t he a dministration,  and d ue t o e xceptional  circumstances,  adherence  to \n the  traditional  notification  process  is  not  possible.  Therefore,  the  NEH  hereby \n terminates your grant in its entirety effective April 1, 2025. \n 70.   The   termination   letter   to   NEH   grantees   asserts   that   Executive   Order   14216 \n “mandates  that t he N  EH  eliminate  all n on-statutorily  required a ctivities  and f unctions.” B  ut N  EH \n is n ot  one  of  the  agencies  named  in  the  Executive  Order  for  eliminating  non-statutorily  required \n activities  and  functions.  As  described a bove, C  avanaugh a nd/or F  ox  were r eportedly  deployed t o \n three  of  the  agencies  that  were  listed  in  Executive  Order  1412:  the  Inter-American  Foundation; \n the  United  States  African  Development  Foundation;  and  the  United  States  Institute  of  Peace. \n That  raises  the  question  of  whether  Cavanaugh  and/or  Fox  copied t he t ermination  letters  used  at \n those agencies for the NEH grant terminations. \n 18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 19 of 46\n 71.   The  termination  notices  included  no  reference  to a ny m  ethod f or  appeal  or t o s eek \n reconsideration,  even  though  NEH’s  General  Terms  and  Conditions  require  that  grantees  have \n the right to appeal a termination. \n 72.   Much   less   than  having  the  opportunity  to  weigh-in  on  termination  decisions, \n according  to  former  or  current  NEH  staff,  relevant  staff  learned  of  the  grant  terminations  at  the \n same  time  that  grant  recipients  received  notifications.  Indeed,  according  to    former  or  current \n NEH  staff,  since  the  terminations  were n ot d one i n N  EH’s  grants m  anagement  system, s taff  have \n had  a  difficult  time  figuring  out  which  awards  have  been t erminated  and w  hat s mall n umber h as \n been left open, and NEH staff still are trying to make sense of what occurred. \n 73.   All   of   Plaintiffs’   open   grants   were   terminated   as   part   of   the   mass   grant \n termination, as were the vast majority of their members’ open grants. 1 3 \n 74.   On  April  3,  2025,  145  NEH  staff  members—making  up  80%  of  the  staff—were \n reportedly placed on administrative leave. 1 4 \n 75.   According  to  accounts  of  former  or  current  NEH  employees ,   this  included  100% \n of  the  staff  of  the  Office  of  Publications,  the  Office  of  Native  and  Indigenous  Affairs  Division, \n and  the  Office  of  Data  and  Evaluation.  On i nformation  and  belief,  it i ncluded  more t han 7 5%  of \n the  staff  of  the  Office  of  Digital  Humanities  Division,  the  Office  of  Communications,  and  the \n Division of Education Programs. \n 76.   According  to  accounts  of  former  or  current  NEH  employees,  Cavanaugh a nd F  ox \n pressured NEH employees to execute a reduction in force (“RIF”) as quickly as possible. \n 13  The Association for Computers and the Humanities maintains a database of terminated grants available at \n https://perma.cc/9FEK-9QML. \n 14  Elizabeth Blair, N  ational Endowment for the Humanities Staff Put on Immediate Leave ,  NPR (Apr. 3, 2025), \n https://perma.cc/7S9C-5P49. \n 19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 20 of 46\n 77.   On   April  9,  2025,  NEH  staff  received  a  notice  alerting  them  to  an  upcoming \n “multi-step  approach  to  restructuring”  that  promised  to  include  a  RIF.  The  notice  stated:  “This \n restructuring  will  consolidate  administrative  and  programmatic  offices t o e nhance  efficiency  and \n streamline  functions.  As   a  result,  the  agency  will  be  forced  to  reduce  the  total  number  of \n positions.” \n7 8.   The  very  next  day,  many  NEH  staff  received  RIF  notifications  that t hey w  ould  be \n terminated  as  of  June  10,  2025.  On  information  and  belief,  approximately  70-80%  of N  EH  staff \n received a RIF notification. \n 79.   According  to  accounts  of  former  or  current  NEH  employees,  as  a  result  of  the \n termination  of   staff   and  grants,  NEH   has   effectively  eliminated  or   nearly  eliminated  entire \n divisions  and  programs,  including  but  not  limited  to t he O  ffice o f  Digital  Humanities,  the O  ffice \n of   Federal/State  Partnerships,  the  Office  of   Data  and  Evaluation,  the  Office  of   Native  and \n Indigenous   Affairs,   the   Office   of   Outreach,   and   the   Office   of   Partnerships   and   Strategic \n Initiatives. \n 80.   A  number  of  NEH  offices  have  announced  that  they  are  cancelling  programs  for \n which  NEH  had  previously  announced  funding  opportunities,  including  programs  of  the  Office \n of  Digital  Humanities,  the  Division  of  Research  Programs,  the  Division  of E  ducation  Programs, \n the  Office  of  Data  and  Evaluation,  the  Division  of  Preservation  and  Access,  the  Division  of \n Public Programs, the Office of Challenge Programs. \n 81.   NEH’s  website  currently  lists  each  of  the  following  grant  programs  as  having \n been ended: \n ●  F  rom the Division of Public Programs \n ○   Digital Projects for the Public \n 20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 21 of 46\n ●   From the Division of Research Programs \n ○   Awards for Faculty at Tribal Colleges and Universities \n ○   Awards for Faculty at Hispanic-Serving Institutions \n ○   Fellowship Programs at Independent Research Institutions \n ○   Dynamic   Language   Infrastructure–Documenting   Endangered   Languages \n Fellowships \n ○   Summer Stipends \n ○   Archaeological and Ethnographic Field Research \n ●   From the Office of Data and Evaluation: \n ○   State and Impact of the Humanities \n ●   From the Division of Education Programs: \n ○   Humanities Initiatives at Hispanic-Serving Institutions \n ○   Humanities Initiatives at Tribal Colleges and Universities \n ○   Humanities Connections \n ○   Spotlight on Humanities in Higher Education \n ●   From the Division of Preservation and Access: \n ○   Cultural and Community Resilience \n ○   Research and Development \n ●   From the Office of Digital Humanities: \n ○   Digital Humanities Advancement Grants \n ○   Fellowships Open Book Program \n ○   Dangers and Opportunities of Technology: Perspectives from the Humanities \n ○   Institutes for Advanced Topics in the Digital Humanities \n 21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 22 of 46\n 82.   As   a   result   of   Defendants’   actions,  NEH   is   no   longer  able  to  effectuate  its \n statutorily-required  duties.  It  has  terminated  nearly  all  of  its  current g rants a nd m  ost o f  its f uture \n programs,  despite  having  nearly  $400  million  in  funding  for  programs  over  the  last  two  years, \n including $192,000,000 it received for grant programs in March 2025. \n 83.   NEH  has  terminated  the  staff  necessary  to  undertake  the  vigorous  peer  review \n process necessary to effectively award new grants. \n 84.   NEH has eliminated most of the staff required to oversee any grants it does award. \n NEH Seeks to Use Grant Funds to Build a “Garden of American Heroes” \n 85.   Just   days   after  terminating  tens  of  millions  of  dollars  in  previously  approved \n grants,  NEH  issued  a  Notice  of  Funding  Opportunity  to  award  up  to  $17  million  in  grants  to \n build   a   “National   Garden   of   American   Heroes.”  The  notice  was   unprecedented  in  several \n respects, some of which render the notice unlawful as well. \n 86.   First,  the  notice  sought  to  use  NEH  funds—which  Congress  has  appropriated  to \n support  “activities  in  the  humanities”—to  fund  what  is  plainly  the  creation  of  “arts”  within  the \n meaning  of  20  U.S.C.  §  952(b).  The  notice  states  that  recipients  of  grant  funds  will  “create \n life-sized  statues  in  marble,  granite,  bronze,  copper,  or  brass  depicting  historical  figures  tied  to \n the  accomplishments  of  the  United  States.” 1 5   But  the  National  Endowment  for  the  Arts—not \n NEH—is  statutorily  charged  with  awarding  grants  for  “the  arts,”  which  is  defined  to  include \n “sculpture”  and  “ t he  arts  related  to  the  presentation,  performance,  execution,  and  exhibition  of \n such   major  art  forms.”  See  20   U.S.C.   §§   952(b),   954.   Congress   charged  NEH  solely  with \n promoting  and  fostering  the  “humanities,”  which C  ongress  defined  to  be  separate  from  “the \n arts.”  See  id.  §§  952(c),  956.  Indeed,  NEA  is  also  providing  $17  million  for  the  Garden,  even \n though by statute NEH and NEA must fund different activities for different purposes. \n 15  See N  otice of Funding Opportunity, https://perma.cc/J5TF-YMP2. \n 22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 23 of 46\n 87.   Indeed,  past  NEH  notices  of  funding  opportunities  made  clear  that,  consistent \n with   statutory   requirements,   no   NEH   funds   could   be   used   for   projects   “outside   of   the \n humanities,”  including  the  “creation  .  .  .  of  art.” 1 6  But  this  requirement  is  conspicuously  absent \n from  the  notice  of  funding  opportunity  for  the  Garden.  NEH  has  provided n o  explanation  for  its \n changes in policies, let alone its deviation from its statutory functions. \n 88.   Second,  nothing  in  the  notice  suggests  that  proposals  for  the G  arden w  ill u ndergo \n the   rigorous,   lengthy  peer-review  process   that  is   typically  required  before  NEH   grants  are \n awarded.  As  explained  above,  that  process  usually  entails  a  multi-step  review  by  experts  in  the \n relevant  humanities  discipline  to  ensure  the i ntellectual  quality  of t he p roject  and i ts s ignificance \n to  the  humanities.  By  contrast,  the  notice  for  the  Garden  provides  that  reviewers'  primary  focus \n will  be  on  considerations  that  have  nothing  to  do  with  the  humanities,  such  as t he “ durab[ility]” \n of  the  sculpture  and  whether  it  “adhere[s]  to  building  codes.”  NEH  has p  rovided n o  explanation \n for its change in processes and criteria for awarding funds. \n 89.   Third,  the  proposed  amount  that  NEH  intends  to  dedicate  to  the  Garden—$17 \n million  total,  consisting  of  $200,000  per  statue—is  unprecedented,  and  contrary  to  Congress’s \n intent  that  NEH  issue  grants  to  a  wide  array  of  deserving  projects,  including  from  scholars  and \n cultural  institutions  that  have  traditionally  been  underrepresented.  See  20  U.S.C.  §  956(c).  As \n explained   above,   most   of   NEH’s   grants   are   for   less   than   $500,000,   and   only  i n   rare \n circumstances  were  grants  awarded  that  exceed  that  amount.  To  Plaintiffs’  knowledge,  no  grant \n program  has  ever  approached  anywhere  near t he $ 34  million  Garden p roposal ( consisting o f  $17 \n million from NEH and $17 million from NEA). \n 16  See, e.g. ,  Notice of Funding Opportunity: Fellowships, https://perma.cc/T8RB-DAYY; N  otice of Funding \n Opportunity: Awards for Faculty, https://perma.cc/KWS9-6H9B. \n 23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 24 of 46\n 90.   Even  if  NEH  were  to  go  forward  with  providing  grants  for  the  Garden,  it  still \n would   not  come  close  to  spending  anywhere  close  to  the  over  $400   million  in  funds   that \n Congress   appropriated   to   NEH   in   the   most   recent   appropriations  statutes,  given  the  mass \n termination of nearly all of NEH’s active grants and NEH staff. \n Plaintiffs, Their Members, and the Community at Large are Injured by NEH’s Decisions \n 91.   Plaintiffs,  their  members,  and  the  broader  public  have  long  relied  on  NEH  grants \n to  fund  deserving  projects  in t he h umanities.  The T  rump A  dministration’s  wholesale d ismantling \n of t he a gency,  termination  of  nearly a ll p reviously a pproved g rants, a nd c ancellation  of  numerous \n programs   moving  forward   has   caused  and  continues  to  cause  Plaintiffs   and  their  members \n serious, irreparable harm. \n 92.   Before  the  recent  mass  terminations,  Plaintiff  ACLS  had t wo  active  NEH  awards. \n The  first  was  an  award,  funded  by  the  Office o f C  hallenge  Programs  in F  ebruary 2 025,  for  up  to \n $500,000   in  Federal  matching  funds  to  support  a  three-year  cooperative  agreement  between \n ACLS  and  NEH.  These  funds  were  awarded  to  support  a  national  convening  to  evaluate  the \n current  state  of  humanities  graduate  education,  make r ecommendations  for  graduate  programs t o \n prepare  students  for  humanities-related  careers,  and  articulate  a  strategic  vision  for  graduate \n education   in   the   humanities.   The   award   included   $270,000   in   subawards   to   Plaintiff   the \n American  Historical  Association,  Plaintiff  the  Modern  Language  Association, a nd t he S  ociety o f \n Biblical Literature (each receiving $90,000). \n 93.   ACLS’s   second  award  consisted  of   a  $207,000   grant,  and  up  to  $105,000  in \n Federal  matching  funds,  issued  by  NEH’s D  ivision  of  Research  Programs  in  June  2023.  The \n award  was  to s upport  three C  hina S  tudies r esearch f ellowships f rom 2 024  to 2 027. T  he n otice  for \n this  grant  stated  that  the  review  process  for  this  grant  was  “extremely  competitive,”  and t hat t he \n decision  to  award  these  grant  funds  was  made o n  the b asis  of N  EH’s  “long-standing  peer r eview \n 24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 25 of 46\n process,”  including  by  a  panel  of  scholars  and  experts  in  the  humanities  and  the  Council  on  the \n Humanities.  Because  this  award  was  terminated  in  April  2025,  ACLS  will  no  longer  be  able  to \n fund these fellowships. \n 94.   ACLS  was  also  planning  on  applying  for  upcoming  grant  opportunities  that h ave \n been  abruptly  cancelled.  For  example,  ACLS  was  planning  to  apply  to  Fellowship  Programs  at \n Independent  Research  Institutions  to  support  its  program  in  China  studies,  but  those  programs \n have  been  discontinued.  ACLS  had  also  engaged  with  other  organizations  about  applying  for  a \n grant  from  the  Office  of  Data  and  Evaluation  for  a  joint  venture  to  conduct  a  data  analysis \n regarding e nrollment  in h umanities  programs a s  well a s f aculty  and g raduate  school n umbers, b ut \n that  Office  has  been  shut  down.  ACLS  had  also  planned  to  apply  for  grants  from  the  Office  of \n Digital Humanities before it was closed. \n 95.   ACLS’s  members  include  organizations  such  as  the  American  Academy  of  Arts \n and  Sciences,  the  American  Philosophical  Society,  and  the  American  Musicological  Society. \n Many  of  ACLS’s  members  have  also  had  their  own  NEH  grants  terminated.  For  example,  the \n American  Musicological  Society  recently  received  a  $204,000  award  to  support  “Music  of  the \n United  States,”  a  longstanding  project  featuring  American  music  of  exceptional  artistic  quality \n and  historical  significance.  This  project  had  been  supported  by  successive  NEH  grants  since \n 1993, until its most recent grant was terminated. \n 96.   Another  member  of  ACLS  and  MLA,  the  University  of  Oregon,  had  multiple \n grants t erminated.  For  example,  the  University  received  a  $350,000  grant  in  September  2024  to \n develop  the  London  Stage  Database,  an  online  resource  that  documents  the  history  of  British \n theater.  The  grant  was  approved  to s upport  the p roject  for  three y ears ( through S  eptember  2027), \n until  it  was  terminated  in  April  2025.  The  University  also  received  a  $149,827  grant  in  April \n 25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 26 of 46\n 2023  to  conduct  research  documenting  the  legacy  of  Indigenous  foods  and  cultural  practices  in \n the  Oregon  Cascades.  The  grant  was  approved  to  support  the  project  for  two  years,  until  it  was \n recently terminated. \n 97.   Another  ACLS  member,  the  University  of  Minnesota, h ad f our  direct  grants f rom \n NEH  terminated,  including  a  $99,782  grant  to  digitize  and  display  flap  books, s uch  as  anatomy \n textbooks, so that their interactive nature is preserved for users. \n 98.   Plaintiff  AHA  had  two  active  NEH  awards  as  of  April  1,  2025.  The  first  was  an \n award  of  $194,261,  issued  by  the  Division  of  Education  Programs  in  March  2025,  to  fund  a \n three-week  program  for  higher-education  faculty  on  the  history  of  U.S.  environmental  policy. \n The   second   was   an  award  of   $191,619,   issued   by   the  Division  of   Education  Programs   in \n September  2024,   to  fund   a  three-week  virtual  institute  for  30  secondary  school  teachers  on \n Africa in world history. Both of these grants were terminated in April 2025. \n 99.   AHA   had   also   applied   and   was   planning   on   applying   for   upcoming   grant \n opportunities  that  have  been  abruptly  cancelled.  For  instance,  AHA  had  recently  submitted  an \n application  for  an  up  to  $250,000  grant  from  the  Institute  for  Advanced  Topics  in  the  Digital \n Humanities  program w  hen  NEH  cancelled  the n otice  of  funding o pportunity a s p  art o f  its b roader \n elimination  of  the  Office  of  Digital  Humanities.  AHA  was  also  planning  to  apply  for  an  up  to \n $150,000  grant  from  the  Office  of  Data  and  Evaluation’s  State  and  Impact  of  the  Humanities \n program until that program was canceled. \n 100.   AHA’s  members h ave  also  had  their  own  grants t erminated.  For  example,  Natalia \n Mehlman  Petrzela  is  an  AHA  member  who  was  awarded a  $ 60,000  grant t o r esearch a nd w  rite a  \n book  on  the  history  of  conflicts  over  public  education  and  public-school  policies  in  America. \n Receiving  an  NEH  grant  was  an  important  milestone  in  her  career  that  signified  the  importance \n 26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 27 of 46\n of  her  work,  helping  her  to  achieve  other  funding  and o pportunities.  Because t he a ward’s  period \n of  performance  was  set  to  begin  on  September  1,  2025,  Dr.  Petrzela  will  not  receive  any  of  the \n NEH funds that she had previously been awarded. \n 101.   Another  AHA  member,  Laura  Morreale,  is  an  independent  scholar  who  was  a \n project  director  for  two  NEH  grants  that  were  terminated.  One o f  those g rants w  as  for  $100,000 \n to  support  preparation  for  digital  publication  of  a  critical  edition  and  translation  from  Italian  to \n English  of  La  Sfera  (The  World), w  ritten b y  Gregorio D  ati. A  s  an i ndependent  scholar,  receiving \n NEH  grants  is  particularly  important  to  Ms.  Morreale.  Without  NEH  funds  to  support  the  La \n Sfera P  roject, the project will not be able to be  completed. \n 102.   A  third  AHA  member,  Dr.  Karen  Cook-Bell,  received  a  $60,000  NEH  grant  to \n write  a  book  on  Black  women’s  anti-slavery  activities  in  South  Carolina  and h ow  they i nformed \n the  Denmark  Vesey  insurrection.  As  with  AHA’s  other  members  whose  grants  were  terminated, \n the  NEH  grant  was  an  important  signifier  to  her  colleagues  and  others  in  her f ield t hat h er w  ork \n had  been a pproved a fter u ndergoing N  EH’s  rigorous  peer-review p rocess. W  ithout  NEH  funding, \n Dr.  Cook-Bell  will n ot b e a ble t o d evote t he f ull t ime  and r esources s he  had i ntended  to d evote t o \n researching  and  writing  the  book  for  which  NEH  had  awarded  her  a  grant.  Dr.  Cook-Bell  also \n applied  in  2024  for  a  $300,000  NEH  Research  Collaborative  Grant  to  produce  a  five-volume \n book  series  on  Black  Women i n U  .S.  History,  but N  EH  recently  notified  her t hat s uch  grants w  ill \n not be awarded in 2025. \n 103.   Plaintiff  MLA  had  two  active  NEH  awards  as  of  April  1,  2025.  The  first  was  a \n $58,201  “Spotlight  in  the  Humanities”  grant,  issued  by  NEH’s  Division  of  Education  Programs \n in   June   2023,   to   support   a   two-year   development   workshop   series   for   college   faculty   to \n reimagine  humanities  coursework   for   career  readiness.  The  second  was  a  grant  of  $30,000, \n 27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 28 of 46\n issued  by  the O  ffice o f D  ata a nd E  valuation  in F  ebruary 2 025,  to s upport  a t wo-day c onvening o f \n humanities  stakeholders  to  assess  the  current  field  of  data  projects  and  practices  related  to  the \n humanities in higher education. \n 104.   MLA  was  also  planning  on  applying  for  upcoming  grant  opportunities  that  have \n been  abruptly  cancelled.  For  example,  MLA  was  planning  to  apply  for  a  $150,000  State  and \n Impact  of  the  Humanities  program  grant.  NEH’s  Office  of  Digital  Humanities  reviewed  MLA’s \n pre-proposal  for  the  grant  and  encouraged  MLA  to  apply,  but  now  MLA  cannot  apply  for  this \n opportunity because the program has been canceled. \n 105.   MLA’s  loss  of  these  opportunities  has  prevented  MLA  from  accomplishing  its \n larger  mission.  MLA’s  Spotlight  grant  enabled  it  to  help  faculty  members  prepare  their  students \n for  careers,  and  the  State  and  Impact  Grant  would  have  enabled  MLA  to  gather  data t hat w  ould \n have  allowed  it  to  develop  a  better  understanding  of  the  work  and  impact  of  the  humanities \n across the nation. \n 106.   MLA’s  members  have  also  been s everely a ffected  by  the s huttering o f  entire  NEH \n divisions  and g rant p rograms, e specially  programs i n  the D  ivision o f E  ducation,  Office o f D  igital \n Humanities,  and  Office  of  Data  and  Evaluation.  Many  MLA  members  were  preparing  to  apply \n for   Humanities   Connections   programs   as   well   as   programs   aimed   at   Hispanic-Serving \n Institutions.  In  addition,  the  Division  of  Research  Programs  sustains  the  research o f m  any M  LA \n members, who rely on NEH summer stipends and fellowships to conduct their research. \n 107.   MLA’s  members  have  also  had  their  own  grants  terminated. F  or  example,  one  of \n MLA’s  members,  Kathleen  Fitzpatrick,  received  a  three-to-one  matching  grant  from  NEH  to \n support   capacity  building  for   Knowledge  Commons,  an  open  platform  to  share  and  access \n 28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 29 of 46\n research  across  disciplines.  Despite  raising  enoug h   money  to  obligate  its  full  NEH  award,  the \n grant was terminated, and Knowledge Commons will soon have to terminate staff. \n 108.   Another  MLA  member,  Professor  Theodore  B.  Fernald,  was  the  project  director \n on  a  $442,752  grant  to  create  accessible  online  language  tools  for  understanding  and  teaching \n Navajo  grammar.  Although  the  grant  was  supposed  to  support  the  development  of  the  project \n over  t he   course   of   three   summers   at   the   Navajo   Language   Academy   field   school,   NEH \n terminated   the   award   midway   through   the   project's   second   year,   depriving   the   project   of \n hundreds of thousands of dollars in NEH-approved funds on which it was relying. \n 109.   Another  MLA  member,  Kathi  Inman  Behrens ,   was  the p rincipal  investigator  on  a \n $149,951   NEH   grant   in   2023   to   support   a   three-year   project   to   develop   a   new \n humanities-focused  minor i n c reative  industries a t P  ortland S  tate U  niversity.  As  with m  any o f  the \n other  grants  described  above,  the  directors  of  the  project  spent  years  developing  it,  applying f or \n the  grant,  and  then  implementing  the  project  using   the  awarded  funds.  Now  that  NEH  has \n terminated  the  grant i n y ear t wo  of  the t hree-year  period o f p  erformance,  the d irectors w  ill n ot  be \n able to complete the project, wasting years of effort and taxpayer funds. \n 110.   Another  MLA   member,   Professor  Rachel  Sagner  Buurma ,   received  a  $60,000 \n NEH  grant  to  research  and  write  a  book  on  the  history  of  free  indirect  discourse a s  it a ppears i n \n literature,   literary  criticism,  and  commercial  reviews  of   books   from  the  early  19th  to  21st \n centuries.  The  termination  of  her  grant  has  caused  significant  disruption t o  her  project,  and  she \n will  no  longer b e a ble t o d evote h er f ull t ime  and a ttention  to r esearching  and w  riting t he b ook  as \n planned. \n 29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 30 of 46\n 111.   If  NEH  restored  the  grant p rograms f or  which a wards  were r ecently  terminated  or \n the  programs  for   which  NEH  was  going  to  issue  new  awards  but  has  now  cancelled  them, \n Plaintiffs and their members would apply and be very competitive for those awards. \n 112.   The  recent  actions  at  NEH   harm  Plaintiffs   and  their  members  in  other  ways \n beyond  the  loss  of  grants  and  future  grant  opportunities.  Without  a f unctioning N  EH,  there i s  no \n central  body  to f und  the w  ork  that c onsortia, c ampuses, a nd i ndividuals  do  to c onduct r esearch i n \n the  humanities,  to  improve  teaching  in  the  humanities,  and  to  make  humanities  programming \n accessible  to  the  public.  NEH  has  played  a  role  in  countless  advances  in  the  humanities  since i t \n was founded, including thousands of books and articles made possible by research grants. \n 113.   Regular  NEH-hosted  convenings  with  project  directors  of  similar  grant p rograms \n have  provided  professional  development  and  networking  opportunities  for  Plaintiffs  and  their \n members,  including  AHA  staff.  Participants  in  these  monthly  meetings  have  built  professional \n relationships  with  leaders  in  peer  organizations  in  a  variety  of  disciplines  and  shared  resources \n and professional strategies that have improved and inspired one another's work. \n 114.   NEH  staff  have  previously  served  on  panels  at  meetings  hosted  by  Plaintiffs  or \n their  members.  For  instance,  NEH  staff  regularly  appeared  at  AHA  annual  meeting  sessions  on \n funding  for  historians.  These  AHA  sessions  were  well  attended  and  extremely  helpful t o A  HA’s \n members.  The  mass  firing  of  NEH  staff  will  make  it  more  difficult  for  AHA’s  members t o l earn \n about  funding  opportunities  and  receive  guidance  on  how  to  apply  for  Federal  funding ( not  just \n for funding from the NEH). \n 115.   NEH  staff  also  regularly  appear  at  MLA  annual  meeting  sessions  in  humanities \n funding.  The  mass  firing  of  NEH  staff  will  make  it  more  difficult  for  MLA’s  members  to  learn \n about funding opportunities and receive guidance on how to apply for Federal funding. \n 30 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 31 of 46\n 116.   NEH  staff  have  also  regularly  attended  meetings  co-hosted  by  ACLS.  NEH  have \n brought  to  these  meetings  a  distinctive  national  perspective  on  the  various s ectors o f h  umanistic \n activity  on  and  off  American  campuses,  including  colleges,  universities,  public  libraries,  local \n history  museums,  and  more.  As   no   other  foundation  or   organization  does,  NEH  staff  have \n knowledge  of  the  many  types  of  institutions  of  higher e ducation  in t he U  nited S  tates w  here w  ork \n in  the  humanities  takes  place:  e.g.  community  colleges,  regional  comprehensive  universities, \n liberal arts colleges, and research universities. \n 117.   NEH   seminars,   institutes,   and  workshops   for   educators  have  been  central  to \n making n ew  research a vailable  for  curriculum  development.  These s eminars a re t he o nly n ational \n structure  designed  to  translate  humanities  research  into  humanities  teaching  in  the  classroom. \n Without  NEH  staff,  there  will  be  a  massive  void  in  the  nation  in  facilitating  the  teaching  of \n humanities. This void is the exact outcome Congress sought to address in establishing the NEH. \n 118.   NEH  has  further  served  as  a  primary  means  by  which  researchers,  scholars,  and \n teachers,  including  Plaintiffs  and  their  members,  receive  credentialing  recognition  for  purposes \n of advancement, promotion, and tenure. \n 119.   The   loss   of   entire   grant   programs   at   NEH   affects  recognition,  ranking,  and \n competitiveness  of  scholars  and  institutions  within  the  higher  education  marketplace,  including \n for Plaintiffs and their members. \n 120.   The  elimination  or  near-elimination  of  entire  NEH  divisions  significantly  harms \n Plaintiffs   and   their   members.   For   instance,   the   Office   of   Digital  Humanities  has   been  an \n important  partner  to t he A  HA  and M  LA.  AHA  and M  LA  will b e m  aterially  harmed b y  losing t he \nO  ffice’s  expertise  and  the  opportunities  it  offered  for  convening  interdisciplinary  conversations \n and workshops in the digital humanities. \n 31 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 32 of 46\n 121.   The  Office  of  Digital  Humanities  has l ikewise p roven i nvaluable  to A  CLS.  ACLS \n has  benefited  from  regular  contact  with e xperts i n t he O  ffice, w  ho  help k eep A  CLS  up  to d ate o n \n new  methods  and  content  for  research, s uch  as n  ewly d igitized  museum c ollections  and a rchives. \n ACLS’s  meetings  with  the  Office  also  led  to  ACLS  obtaining  a  Chair’s g rant  from  NEH  for  the \n creation  of  a  national  commission  of  scholars,  archivists,  administrators,  and  funders  to  make  a \n set  of  recommendations  concerning  how  best  to  support  and  sustain  digital  scholarship.  The \n Chair’s  grant  was  later  supplemented  by  the  Mellon  Foundation  with  an  expanded c harge a s  the \n Commission for Fostering and Sustaining Diverse Digital Scholarship. \n 122.   Similarly,  the  Office o f  Digital  Humanities’s  Institutes f or  Advanced T  opics i n t he \n Digital  Humanities  have  provided  training  and  professional  development  for  MLA  members, \n allowing   them   to   bridge   humanities  and  technical  expertise  that  improved  scholarship  and \n training   for   undergraduate   and   graduate   students.   One   MLA   member’s   Institute   brought \n humanities  training  to  over  500  participants  across  at  least  35  institutions  across  the  country. \n Funding   from  the  Office  also  supported  key  infrastructure  for   the  prototype  of  Knowledge \n Commons,  which  until  recent  termination  of  the  NEH  contract,  had  become  the  official  NEH \n repository of open access research, making the humanities broadly available to all. \n 123.   NEH   has   more  broadly  supported  key  digital  infrastructure  projects  that  have \n benefited  the  public  in  various  ways.  NEH  has  been  an  influential  source  of  funding  for  the \n software  and  tools  that  support   and  facilitate h igh-quality  research  and  public  access  work. \n NEH’s  funding i nvestments  have b een c entral  to t he f ormation  and i mplementation  of  descriptive \n practices   that   make   research   materials   findable   and   useable,   such   as   the  World  Historical \n Gazetteer,   which  is   an  index  of  historical  place  names,  or  PeriodO,  which  is  a  gazetteer  of \n historical,  art-historical,  and  archaeological  time  periods.  These  indexes  are  the  building  blocks \n 32 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 33 of 46\n of   shared   understanding.   Similarly,   NEH’s   support   has   been  vital  to  the  development  and \n maintenance   of   tools   to   support   transcription   and   translation   of   archival   and   audio-visual \n materials,   such   as   the   Oral   History   Metadata   Synchronizer   and   High   Performance   Sound \n Technologies   for   Access   and   Scholarship,   which   make   a   wider   range   of   cultural   objects \n accessible  and  open  to  analysis.  Additionally,  a r ange  of  new  developments  in m  achine  learning \n and  computational  analysis o f  a r ange o f m  aterials,  both t extual  and a udio v isual, w  ould  not h ave \n been   possible   without   initial   funding   from   the   NEH.   All  of   these  elements  of   the  digital \n infrastructure  are  freely  available  both  to s cholars a nd t he p ublic s o  that t hey c an b e l everaged  to \n forge   new   understandings   of   literature,   history,   art,   and   culture.   NEH’s   investment  in  the \n development  and s ustainability  of  these t ools a nd m  ethods h as c reated  a d igital  infrastructure  that \n serves as a springboard for new research and knowledge creation in the humanities and beyond. \n 124.   NEH  staff  in  the  Division  of  Research  Programs  and  the  Division  of  Education \n Research  have  played  a  key  role  in  ensuring  that  a  diverse  range  of  institutions  have  access  to \n funding,  not  only  from  the  NEH  but a lso f rom A  CLS  and i ts m  ember  societies  and p hilanthropic \n foundations.  The  NEH’s  detailed  knowledge  of  humanistic  activity  across  all  U.S.  states  and \n territories   guides   the   development   of   ACLS’s   grant   opportunities   and   the   design   of   its \n competitions and evaluation criteria. \n Plaintiffs’ Categories of Claims \n 125.   Plaintiffs assert two categories of claim in this action. \n 126.   First,   Plaintiffs   challenge  the  institutional  actions  taken  at  NEH,  including  by \n DOGE,  to  eliminate  or  nearly  eliminate  entire  divisions,  to  shut  down  entire  programs,  to  mass \n fire  staff,  to  fund  the  Garden  of  Heroes,  and  to  delay  spending  or  outright  refuse  to  spend  the \n funds  that  Congress  appropriated  to  NEH  (the  “Institutional  Claims”).  Plaintiffs’  Institutional \n 33 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 34 of 46\n Claims  do  not  challenge  the  termination  of  any  individual  grant  or  seek  to  restore  or  compel \n payments   under   any   individual   grant.   Plaintiffs   assert   their   Institutional   Claims   under  the \n Administrative  Procedure  Act  (“APA”)  and  through  nonstatutory  claims  based  on  Defendants’ \n unconstitutional and  ultra vires  actions. \n 127.   Second,  Plaintiffs  assert  claims  challenging  the  termination  of  grants,  including \n the  grants  of  Plaintiffs  and  their  members  (the  “Grant  Termination  Claims”).  Plaintiffs  assert \n their   Grant   Termination   claims   only   through   nonstatutory   claims   based   on   Defendants’ \n unconstitutional and  ultra vires  actions. \n CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n COUNT ONE \n Institutional Claims: Violation of the Separation of Powers \n APA Cause of Action \n (Against All Defendants) \n 128.   Plaintiffs   hereby   incorporate   by   reference   the   foregoing   paragraphs   of   the \n Complaint as if set forth herein. \n 129.   The APA provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency \n action “not in accordance with law,” “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or \n immunity,” or “in excess of statutory . . . authority.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A)-(C). \n 130.   Defendants have made a final decision and taken final agency action to eliminate \n or nearly eliminate entire divisions, to shut down entire programs, to mass fire staff, and to delay \n spending or outright refuse to spend the funds appropriated to NEH by Congress. These actions \n individually and collectively are part of an effort to effectively dismantle the agency. \n 131.   Defendants’ final agency actions violate the constitutional separation of powers. \n 132.   The Constitution empowers Congress to make laws, U.S. Const. art. I, § 1, and \n 34 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 35 of 46\n requires the President to faithfully execute those laws,  id. a rt. II, § 3. Congress’s powers to set \n the policies of the nation are at their apex when it comes to spending money, as the Constitution \n “exclusively grants the power of the purse to Congress, not the President.”  City & Cnty. of San \n Francisco v. Trump  , 897 F.3d 1225, 1238 (9th Cir.  2018)). \n 133.   The Executive Branch has no constitutional authority to refuse to carry out laws \n enacted by Congress, and it has no constitutional authority to block, amend, subvert, or delay \n spending appropriations based on the President’s own policy preferences. \n 134.   Defendants’ decisions to dismantle NEH, including to eliminate or nearly \n eliminate entire divisions, to shut down entire programs, and to mass fire staff, violates the \n separation of powers by precluding NEH from carrying out its statutory functions and purposes \n under 20 U.S.C. §§ 951 and 956. \n 135.   Defendants’ decisions to delay spending and outright refusal to spend the amounts \n Congress appropriated violates Congress’s power of the purse and the separation of powers. \n 136.   Accordingly, Defendants’ actions are contrary to the Constitution, and must be \n vacated and set aside. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (B). \n COUNT TWO \n Institutional and Grant Termination Claims: Violation of the Separation of \n Powers–Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and  Ultra Vires  Actions \n (Against Defendants McDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox) \n 137.

Defendants’   decisions   to   dismantle   NEH,   including   to   eliminate   or   nearly \n eliminate  entire  divisions,  to  shut  down  entire  programs,  and  to  mass  fire  staff,  violates  the \n separation  of  powers  by  precluding  NEH  from  carrying  out  its  statutory  functions  and  purposes \n under 20 U.S.C. §§ 951 and 956. \n 142.   Defendants’  decisions  to  delay  spending  and  outright  refuse  to  spend  the  amounts \n Congress appropriated violates Congress’s power of the purse and the separation of power \n 143.   Defendants’   termination   of   grants,  including  the  grants  of   Plaintiffs   and  their \n members,  violates  the  separation  of  powers,  because  the  mass  and  individual  terminations  of \n grants  are  a  primary  means  by   which  NEH   is   not  carrying  out  its  statutory  functions  and \n purposes,  and  by  which  Defendants  are  unlawfully  deferring  spending  and  outright  refusing  to \n spend appropriated funds. \n 144.   Because  Defendants’  actions  violate  the  separation  of  powers  and  are  ultra  vires  , \n they should be enjoined and declared unconstitutional. \n 36 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 37 of 46\n COUNT THREE \n Institutional Claims: Impoundment Control Act and Appropriations Acts Violations \n APA Cause of Action \n (Against All Defendants) \n 145.

By   delaying   spending   or   outright   refusing   to   spend   money   that   Congress \n appropriated,  eliminating  or  nearly  eliminating  entire  divisions,  shutting  down  entire  programs, \n and  mass  firing  staff,  Defendants  are  violating  the  Impoundment  Control  Act  of  1974  (ICA). \n Under  the  ICA,  a “ deferral”  includes  any  “withholding  or  delaying  the o bligation  or e xpenditure \n of”   appropriated   funds,   as   well   as   “any  other  type  of   Executive  action  or   inaction  which \n effectively  precludes  the  obligation  or  expenditure  of”  appropriated  funds.  2  U.S.C.  §  682(1). \n When  the  Executive  Branch  wishes  to  defer  funds,  it  must  send  a  special  message  to  Congress \n detailing  the  money  to  be  deferred  and  the  reasons  for  deferral.  There a re o nly t hree p ermissible \n grounds  for  deferrals,  none  of  which  includes e ffort t o e nsure f unds  are s pent c onsistent w  ith t he \n President’s policy priorities.  Id.  § 684(b). \n 147.   Defendants’  actions  constitute  a  “deferral”  because  they  reflect  a  “withholding  or \n delaying  [of]  the  obligation  or  expenditure  of”  funds  that  Congress  appropriated  for  NEH.  2 \n U.S.C.  §  682(1).  Defendants  did n ot n otify C  ongress  of  the d eferrals a s  the I CA  requires, n or  did \n Defendants undertake the deferrals for reasons permitted by the ICA. \n 148.   Defendants’   actions   also   constitute   an   unlawful   “rescission”   of   the   funds \n appropriated  for   NEH.   Where  the  President  seeks  to  “rescind”  appropriated  funds,  the  ICA \n requires,  among  other  things,  that  the  President  send  a  special  message  to  Congress  specifying \n the f unds  he  seeks  to  have  rescinded  and  the  reasons  for  his  proposal.  2  U.S.C.  §  683(a).  The \n President did not do so. \n 37 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 38 of 46\n 149.   Defendants  are  also v iolating  the F  urther C  onsolidated  Appropriations A  ct o f  2024 \n and  the  March  2025  Continuing  Resolution.  Congress  provided  in t he 2 024  Appropriations t hat, \n of  the $ 207  million  lump-sum a ppropriated  to N  EH,  “$192,000,000 s hall b e a vailable  for  support \n of  activities  in  the  humanities,  pursuant  to  section  7(c)  of  the”  National  Foundation  on  the  Arts \n and   the  H  umanities   Act   of   1965,   20   U.S.C.   §   956(c).   Congress   further   provided   that \n “$15,000,0000  shall  be  available  to  carry  out  the  matching  grants  program  pursuant  to”  20 \n U.S.C. § 959(a)(2), including “$13,000,000 for the purposes of” 20 U.S.C. § 956(h). \n 150.   Congress  has  carried  forward  these  appropriations  in  continuing  resolutions. M  ost \n recently,  on  March  15, 2  025,  Congress  enacted  a c ontinuing  resolution t hat r e-appropriated  all o f \n the  funds  appropriated  to  NEH  under t he 2 024  Act, w  ith t he s ame b reakdown o n  how  the m  oney \n must be spent. Pub. L. 119-4, §§ 1101-08, 139 Stat. 9, 10-12 (Mar. 15, 2025). \n 151.   As  a  result  of  their  actions,  Defendants  will  not  spend  the  hundreds  of m  illions  of \n dollars  that  Congress  appropriated  for  NEH,  including  the  hundreds  of  millions  that  Congress \n mandated NEH spend to support the humanities by issuing grants under 20 U.S.C. § 956(c). \n 152.   Accordingly,  Defendants’  actions  are  “not  in  accordance  with  law”  and “ in e xcess \n of statutory authority,” in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C). \n COUNT FOUR \n Institutional and Grant Termination Claims: Impoundment Control Act and \n Appropriations Acts Violations–Nonstatutory Review and  Ultra Vires  Actions \n (Against Defendants McDonald Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox) \n 153.   Plaintiffs   hereby   incorporate   by   reference   the   foregoing   paragraphs   of   the \n Complaint as if set forth herein. \n 154.   Plaintiffs   may  bring  a  nonstatutory  claim  to  enjoin  Defendants  McDonald  and \n Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox from acting  ultra vires  in violation of statutory commands. \n 38 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 39 of 46\n 155.   Defendants’  delay  in  spending  or  outright  refusal  to  spend  money  that  Congress \n appropriated,   elimination   or   near   elimination   of   entire   divisions,   shutting   down   of   entire \n programs,  and  mass  firing  of  staff  are  without  statutory  authority  and  violate  the  Impoundment \n Control Act, the 2024 Appropriations Act, and subsequent Continuing Resolutions. \n 156.   Defendants’   termination   of   grants,  including  the  grants  to  Plaintiffs   and  their \n members,  is  without  statutory  authority a nd  violates  the  Impoundment  Control  Act,  the  2024 \n Act,  and  2025  Continuing  Resolutions,  because t he i ndividual  grant t erminations  were a  p rimary \n means  by  which  Defendants  carried  out  their d eferral  of  appropriated  funds  and o utright r efusals \n to spend appropriated funds. \n 157.   Because  Defendants’  actions  violate  statutory  commands  and  are  ultra  vires  ,  they \n should be enjoined and declared unlawful. \n COUNT FIVE \n Institutional Claims: Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Actions \n APA Cause of Action \n (Against All Defendants) \n 158.   Plaintiffs   hereby   incorporate   by   reference   the   foregoing   paragraphs   of   the \n Complaint as if set forth herein. \n 159.   A   reviewing   court   must   “hold   unlawful   and  set  aside  agency  action”  that  is \n “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not i n a ccordance  with l aw.” 5   U.S.C. \n § 706(2)(A). \n 160.   Defendants’  decisions  to  eliminate  or  nearly  eliminate  entire  divisions,  to  shut \n down  entire  programs,  to  mass  fire  staff,  and  to  delay  spending  or  outright  refuse  to  spend  the \n funds  appropriated  to N  EH  by C  ongress,  are e ach f inal a gency a ctions r eviewable  under 5   U.S.C. \n §§ 702 and 706. \n 39 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 40 of 46\n 161.   Defendants’  actions a re a rbitrary  and c apricious.  Defendants h ave p rovided l ittle  to \n no   explanation,   let   alone   reasoned   explanations,   for   these   decisions.   They   have   failed   to \n adequately  justify  their  actions;  have  not  considered  or  addressed  key  aspects  of  the  problem, \n reasonable  alternatives,  and  the  substantial  reliance  interests  at  stake;  have  relied  on  factors t hat \n Congress   did  not  authorize  them  to  consider;  and  have  not  acknowledged  or  justified  their \n change from prior agency positions. \n 162.   Defendants’  abandonment  of  NEH’s  rigorous,  staff-advisory  process  for  issuing \n grants,   including   for   the   Garden   of   Heroes   and  other  future  awards,   is   also  arbitrary  and \n capricious  because  the  agency  has  not  adequately  justified  this  action,  has  not  considered  or \n addressed   key   aspects   of   the   problem,  reasonable  alternatives,  and  the  substantial  reliance \n interests  at  stake;  has  relied  on  factors  that  Congress  did n ot a uthorize  them t o c onsider; a nd h as \n not acknowledged or justified its change from prior agency practice and positions. \n 163.   Accordingly,  Defendants’  actions  are  “arbitrary”  or  “capricious,”  in  violation  of \n the APA. 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). \n COUNT SIX \n Institutional Claims: Statutory Violations and Arbitrary and Capricious Agency Action in \n Funding the “Garden of American Heroes” \n APA Cause of Action \n (Against All Defendants) \n 164.   Plaintiffs   hereby   incorporate   by   reference   the   foregoing   paragraphs   of   the \n Complaint as if set forth herein. \n 165.   A   reviewing   court   must   “hold   unlawful   and  set  aside  agency  action”  that  is \n “arbitrary,  capricious,  an  abuse  of  discretion,  or  otherwise  not  in  accordance  with  law,”  or  “in \n excess of statutory . . . authority.” 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C). \n 40 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 41 of 46\n 166.   Defendants’  decision  to  use  funds  that  Congress  appropriated  to  NEH  to  support \n activities  in  the  humanities  for  the  creation  of  statues  in  the  proposed  “Garden  of  American \n Heroes” is a final agency action reviewable under 5 U.S.C. §§ 702 and 706. \n 167.   Defendants’  decision  to  use  NEH  funds  to  create  statues  in  the  proposed  “Garden \n of American Heroes” is arbitrary and capricious and not in accordance with law. \n 168.   Defendants’  decision  to  use N  EH  funds  to c reate  statues i s  contrary t o l aw b ecause \n the  National  Foundation  on  the  Arts  and  Humanities  Act  limited  NEH’s  activities  to  promoting \n the  “humanities”  and  prohibits  NEH  from  using  appropriation  to  fund  “the  arts,”  including  the \n creation of statues. 20 U.S.C. §§ 951,952, 954, 956. \n 169.   Defendants’  decision  to  use N  EH  funds  to c reate  statues i s  arbitrary  and c apricious \n because  Defendants  have  failed  to  adequately  justify  their  actions;  have  failed  to  consider  key \n aspects  of  the  problem,  reasonable  alternatives,  and  the  substantial  reliance  interests  at  stake; \n have   relied   on   factors   Congress   did   not   authorize   them   to   consider;   and   have   failed   to \n acknowledge   or   justify   their   change   of   position   from   prior   agency   policy.   In   particular, \n Defendants   have   not   acknowledged  or   addressed  NEH’s   change  from  longstanding  agency \n policy not to spend grant funds on works of art. \n 170.   Accordingly,  Defendants’  actions  are  not  in a ccordance  with l aw,  beyond s tatutory \n authority, and arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (C). \n COUNT SEVEN \n Institutional Claim: Violation of the First Amendment–APA Cause of Action \n (Against All Defendants) \n 171.   Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  the  foregoing  paragraphs  as  if  set  forth \n herein. \n 172.   The APA provides that a reviewing court shall hold unlawful and set aside agency \n 41 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 42 of 46\n action “not in accordance with law,” or “contrary to constitutional right, power, privilege.” 5 \n U.S.C. §§ 706(2)(A), (B). \n 173.   The First Amendment provides that the Federal government “shall make no \n law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.” U.S. Const. amend. I. \n 174.   The First Amendment prohibits the government from “regulating speech when the \n specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the \n restriction.”  Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of U  niv. of Va.  , 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995). \n “Discrimination against speech because of its message is presumed to be unconstitutional.”  Id. a t \n 828. \n 175.   “[E]ven in the provision of subsidies, the Government may not ‘ai[m] at the \n suppression of dangerous ideas.’” F  inley ,  524 U.S.  at 587 (quoting  Regan ,  461 U.S. at 55) \n (alteration in original). In the grant-making context, the government may not reject “a whole \n class of projects” based on “viewpoint alone,” or use Federal funding to “impose a \n disproportionate burden calculated to drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.” \n Rhode Island Latino Arts v. Nat’l Endowment for the Arts ,  No. CV 25-79 WES, 2025 WL \n 1009026, at *12 (D.R.I. Apr. 3, 2025) (quoting F  inley ,   524 U.S. at 587). \n 176.   Defendants’ termination of nearly all NEH grants awarded during the prior \n Administration, and leaving in place existing and future grants that align with particular political \n and ideological viewpoints, is “the product of invidious viewpoint discrimination.”  Finley ,  524 \n U.S. at 587. Defendants terminated the grants based on viewpoint, in an effort to drive such \n views out of the marketplace of ideas. The First Amendment does not tolerate such viewpoint \n discrimination. \n 177.   Accordingly, Defendants’ actions are not in accordance with law, contrary to \n 42 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 43 of 46\n constitutional right or power, and arbitrary and capricious, in violation of the APA. 5 U.S.C. §§ \n 706(2)(A), (B). \n COUNT EIGHT \n Institutional and Grant Termination Claims: Violation of the First Amendment \n Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and  Ultra Vires  Actions \n (Against Defendants McDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox) \n 178.   Plaintiffs  hereby  incorporate  by  reference  the  foregoing  paragraphs  as  if  set  forth \n herein. \n 179.   Federal  district  courts  have  jurisdiction  to  enjoin  Federal  officials  from  violating \n the  Constitution.  See  Armstrong  v.  Exceptional  Child  Ctr.,  Inc. ,   575  U.S.  320,  327-28  (2015); \n Trump   v.   Hawaii ,    585   U.S.   667,   675   (2018)   (considering   First   Amendment   challenge   to \n presidential proclamation). \n 180.   As   alleged  in  Count  Seven,  Defendants’  termination  of  grants  on  the  basis  of \n viewpoint   violates   the   First   Amendment.   Because   Defendants’   actions   violate   the   First \n Amendment,   those   actions   lack   lawful   authority.   The  Court  should   therefore  declare  them \n unconstitutional and  ultra vires  . \n 181.   If   Defendants’   actions   are   not   declared   unlawful,   set   aside,   and   enjoined  as \n unconstitutional  and  ultra  vires  ,  Plaintiffs  will  suffer  substantial  injury,  including  irreparable \n injury. \n COUNT NINE \n Institutional and Grant Termination Claims: DOGE Actions Without Authority \n Implied Right of Action, Nonstatutory Review, and  Ultra Vires  Actions \n (Against Defendants McDonald, Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox) \n 182.   Plaintiffs   hereby   incorporate   by   reference   the   foregoing   paragraphs   of   the \n Complaint as if set forth herein. \n 43 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 44 of 46\n 183.   Under  the  Constitution,  Congress  has  the  authority  to  set  the  powers  and d uties o f \n Federal agencies. U.S. const.  art. I, §  8  , cl. 18. \n 184.   Federal  agencies  “possess  only  the  authority  that  Congress  has  provided.”  Nat’l \n Fed.  of  Indep.  Bus.  v.  OSHA  ,  595  U.S.  109,  117  (2022).  “[A]n  agency  literally  has  no  power  to \n act  .  .  .  unless  and  until  Congress  confers  power  upon  it.”  La.  Pub.  Serv.  Comm’n  v.  FCC ,   476 \n U.S. 355, 374 (1986). \n 185.   Congress  did n ot c reate  DOGE  and h as  not v ested D  OGE  with a ny p owers.  Rather, \n DOGE was created by the President via Executive Order. \n 186.   Congress   has   not   authorized   DOGE   to   conduct   the   business   of   another \n congressionally authorized agency such as NEH. \n 187.   According   to   former   or   current   NEH   staff,   and   a   recording   of   McDonald’s \n statements  to  NEH  staff  on  April  3,  2025,  Defendants  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  of  DOGE  directly \n carried  out  the  termination  of  NEH  grants,  including  the  grants  of  Plaintiffs  and  their  members, \n by  selecting  the  grants  to  be  terminated,  drafting  the  termination  letters,  and  emailing  out  the \n termination notice to grantees from a non-NEH email address and server. \n 188.   According  to  former  or   current  NEH   staff,  Cavanaugh  and  Fox  were  also  the \n driving   force   behind   the   mass   staff   firings,   which  has   resulted  in  the  elimination  or   near \n elimination of entire NEH divisions and programs. \n 189.   Because   DOGE   does   not   possess   any   congressionally   conferred   authority   to \n terminate  NEH  grants  or  make  other  institutional  decisions  of  NEH,  the  actions  of  McDonald, \n Gleason, Cavanaugh, and Fox, are  ultra vires  and should b e enjoined and declared unlawful. \n 44 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-03657     Document 1     Filed 05/01/25     Page 45 of 46\n REQUEST FOR RELIEF \n WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs request that this Court \n A.
