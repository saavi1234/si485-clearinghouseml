As the Court proposed in November, any Respondent who accepts full or partial responsibility for misconduct found by the panel may thus advise the Court and, in lieu of showing cause, explain with specificity the misconduct for which he or she accepts responsibility and comment on the appropriate sanction in his or her response to this order. Any Respondent who believes that specific additional evidence is necessary for the Court to determine a Respondent's culpability or an appropriate sanction must move the Court for such action by 3/8/2024 and shall set out in detail that specific additional evidence in said filing. The Respondents' show-cause briefs are due by 3/22/2024. In a separate filing, the Respondents must identify those portions of all other Respondents' briefs with which they agree or disagree by 4/5/2024. The Court has made reasonable efforts to set the show-cause hearing on dates in February or March which are free of scheduling conflicts for the Respondents and their attorneys, but it has met with no success. The Court will therefore set this matter in May and expect the Respondents and their attorneys to be available. The Respondents must appear in Courtroom 2F of the United States Courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama at 9:30 a.m. on May 22 and 23, 2024. Signed by Honorable Judge Liles C. Burke on 2/21/2024.

Ms. Levi's show-cause brief is due by May 11, 2024. In a separate filing, Ms. Levi must identify those portions of all other Respondents' briefs with which she agrees or disagrees by May 21, 2024.

The Court will hold a hearing on May 23, 2024 at 9:30 a.m. in Courtroom 2F of the U.S. Courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama to discuss factual and procedural issues for the show-cause hearing. The May 22 hearing, however, is CANCELLED. Given the objections and motion practice that followed the first show-cause order and the volume of work that these entailed, the show-cause hearing is RESET for 9:30 a.m. on June 27 and 28, 2024 in Courtroom 2F of the U.S. Courthouse in Montgomery, Alabama.
